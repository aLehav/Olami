While health care has been in the national spotlight for many months, legislation to reform student financial aid has been lurking in the shadows.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. Senate could approve an overhaul of the student financial aid system that would deliver larger Pell grant awards to low-income college students and switch federal loans to direct lending.
The reform is part of the Health Care & Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, which both eliminates subsidies for private lenders and puts the finishing touches on the health care reform legislation that President Barack Obama signed into law Tuesday.
To pass the Senate, the bill needs 51 votes, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) has said that he has signed support for the bill from 52 Senate Democrats.
The House of Representatives passed the bill, which makes the federal government the source for student loan funding, on Sunday. The borrowing process won’t change, but students seeking PLUS loans should find it easier and slightly cheaper to borrow funds. Private companies will still handle billing and support for the loans.
Cutting out payments to lenders such as Sallie Mae and private banks would save the U.S. Treasury $61 billion during the next decade. Nearly two-thirds of those savings would go toward increasing Pell grants in five out of the next 10 years.
Pell grants are federal grants awarded to low-income students. The majority of Pell grants go to families earning less than $30,000 annually. The federal Pell Grant Program is expected to fund $32 billion in grants for more than eight million low-income students this year.
The Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act passed by the House in September called for Pell grant awards to be tied to the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers plus 1 percent. The bill, now in the Senate, does not include the extra 1 percent and only indexes to inflation between 2013 and 2017, but the maximum Pell grant award would still jump to $5,975 by 2017 from $5,350 this academic year.
Without adoption of the reconciliation bill, awards would be cut 60 percent, starting in the fall of 2011, decreasing Pell grants to $2,150 because the 2008 stimulus bill funds that provided a boost to the program in 2009 are set to run out in 2011. An unexpectedly high number of grant recipients during the economic downturn, including 800,000 more students than expected last fall, has driven the program into a $19 billion deficit since 2008. Of the $36 billion pegged for Pell grant funding, $13.5 billion would be used for reducing the program deficit.
USC California Student Public Interest Research Group organizer William Sealey said passage of the bill would mark a huge success for students.
“The bill makes sure [the federal government] provides billions of dollars to grant aid for students that doesn’t have to ever be paid back,” he said.
House Committee on Education and Labor member Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) said the Pell grant cap increase is the most important part of the bill.
“This is the single greatest infusion to student aid by the federal government since the G.I. Bill,” he said in a conference call.
Some, however, believe the transition to direct lending is equally important.
Alex Silkin, a freshman majoring in business administration who worked with CalPIRG to lobby for the financial aid reform, said the bill fixes a system that no longer makes sense.
“The government is basically paying banks to give out money, but this streamlines the system and takes private investors out of the equation,” he said.
Lawmakers had budgeted for more savings, up to $87 billion, but some universities have already begun switching to federal lending on their own. According to Rep. Tim Bishop (D-N.Y.), House rules for calculating savings only allow consideration of money saved at the time of the bill’s passage. Overall savings, however, are estimated to remain near $80 billion.
Last summer, about 20 percent of colleges had direct lending programs. Now, 40 percent have switched to the program, and by this time next year, Bishop estimated that 70 percent of schools would implement it if student aid reform fails to pass this year.
The direct lending aspect of the bill has been controversial, but several democratic representatives were swayed to vote for the bill after hearing students would see their Pell grants decline steeply — as many as 600,000 students would lose their aid altogether.
A Pell grant recipient, Christian Daly, a junior majoring in English, said the grant takes pressure off students and parents wondering how to send their children to college, especially to an expensive one like USC.
“The Pell grant means opportunity,” he said. “It’s a glimmer of hope and a light for the student and the parents so that they can go to school and receive the education they want.”

The landmark health care reform legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama on Tuesday mandates significant changes to the current health care system, some of which could be particularly helpful to graduate students.
Under the new legislation, most U.S. citizens will be required to have health insurance, but young adults now have the option to stay on their parents’ plans longer.
This could be particularly useful for graduate students, because many do not have much income and health insurance is not necessarily within the budgets of many students, said Johannes Schmitt, president of the Graduate and Professional Student Senate.
Currently, students are left to purchase their own health insurance after graduation, but the new legislation will allow young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans until they turn 27.
Whether young adults decide to stay on their parents’ plan is up to each family, said Jeffrey McCombs, associate professor and health care expert at USC. He said families should weigh the cost of keeping a dependent on their insurance against the price of buying a new plan for the young adult.
“The family premium is going to be higher than before,” McCombs said. “How much extra is it for family [plans] vs. for personal? Personally calculate it.”
Currently, many adults coming out of college choose not to buy health insurance at all because they feel it is not necessary when they are healthy, said Dana Goldman, director of USC’s Schaeffer Center.
“A lot of people are uninsured since they leave college … In general, health insurance is not a good deal,” Goldman said. “They are generally being asked to enter a risk pool for people who are not healthy.”
Remaining uninsured will no longer be an option with the new legislation, however, as the national health care reform mandates that all U.S. citizens have their own insurance, with very few exceptions.
Opting out of insurance is particularly common among Ph.D. and graduate students who are not taking enough units for USC to require them to purchase a health plan, Schmitt said.
GPSS senator and first-year medical student Jenny Farah said allowing students to remain on their parents’ health insurance bill is going to help many graduate students.
“For many graduate students … we weren’t under our parents’ plan,” Farah said. “That’s one of the big changes I anticipate for next year, that more students are going to choose their parents’ plan.”
Schmitt, however, noted that the new health care plan could cause problems for graduate students who are older than 26 and want to remain uninsured.
“It’s going to be costly,” Schmitt said. “Many grad students nationwide are uninsured and now are required to be insured. For some it’s going to be a tough choice what to do.”
Farah and Schmitt said the USC health insurance plan is reasonable for most students, but there are certain cases, such as if a student is married or claims a dependent, where the costs skyrocket.
The Graduate and Professional Student Senate has been working with USC insurance to create a new plan for graduate students they hope will alleviate some concerns about costs, according to Farah.
“USC is a very big proponent of everyone being insured,” Farah said. “They were really great about making sure that would be addressed for next year.”
The new legislation will help all students once they graduate — whether or not they choose to go on to grad school.
Kanika Jain, a senior majoring in business administration who is set to graduate this spring, said she would like to stay on her parents’ plan once she graduates.
“Thinking about health insurance right after you graduate is overwhelming, among all the other things to worry about,” Jain said. “Having my parents’ insurance plan just provides some comfort that I’m going to be taken care of for the next couple of years.”
I like Bill O’Reilly’s thinking on this issue (paraphrased): “If my kid thinks he’s going to stay dependent on me until he’s 26, he’s going to *need* health insurance.”
It’s a hard, cold world out there, and your mother’s bosom is warm and soft, so the temptation to see the “benefit” in dependency is great. But what would really “benefit” you more is entering the adult world, embracing independence, and learning self-reliance.
Yes, that Bill O’Reilly is a  master of putting his selfish, self-centered agenda into catchy phrases. One of the favorite arguments from the GOP sympathizers is to portray it as benefiting just the lazy people who don’t want to work and who wish to perpetually rely on the government. Nothing could be further from the truth. There are only about a million examples to the contrary. Think of a graduate student completing his or her Masters degree on a full-time basis. Is that person trying to avoid the “adult world” or refusing to become “independent”? Of course not. Does he or she not deserve health insurance that they might not be able to afford on their own? Bill O’Reilly might say no, those of us less nearsighted will say yes.
I sure hope the independent and self-reliant Joe won’t find himself in the situation when he’ll have to rely on the subsidized health care, COBRA, unemployment insurance or collect Medicare or Medicaid. He might fall off his high horse and hurt himself. And if he has no health insurance…

A USC professor is in the hospital with injuries after being struck by a car on campus Wednesday.
Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said a USC student was driving south on McClintock Avenue toward 37th Street, when a female professor stepped off the curb by the Davis School of Gerontology and started to cross the street. As the professor was crossing, the student’s car struck her.
LAPD, DPS and an ambulance arrived on the scene and treated the victim. She was taken to California Hospital Medical Center.
This incident follows another on-campus accident that occurred March 12, when a student crossing McClintock Avenue behind Leavey Library failed to see an oncoming car. The student was hit by the car and hospitalized. 
DPS officials warned that students should always look both ways before crossing.
“Never assume that you have the right of way,” Carlisle said. “Make sure you are seen by oncoming traffic and, more, that they stop for you.”
i think that female asian drivers should not be allowed to drive on campus because i have seen them many a time driving dangerously. nuff said.
The people who have been on campus the longest, the staff, the faculty, the maintenance crews and the various bus drivers, are all usually careful and cautious when walking or driving on the grounds. The variable that changes constantly, is the student population. Even then, most students know to slow down and look both ways, whether in a car or on foot. But statistically you will have some students who are texting, eating or ipoding while moving, and these are the people who cause accidents. 
There are safety procedures on campus, but if there is a demand for more aggressive tactics, I recommend DPS patrols the grounds and find the Texters, Ipoders and other distracted travelers on campus, and makes them wear neon yellow dunce caps, so that nearby travelers can be more cautious around them. If found without their caps, they should be fined 500 dollars, with the money going to the health clinic.  Perhaps we can pair this with an ankle GPS bracelet so that the buss drivers have another method of tracking these spatially deficient people.
I hope the teacher gets better, and honestly, I hope the student loses her car privileges, but I think a little anger and sarcasm should be felt when reacting to this story; that is the only way change will happen so that we can avoid another accident. If all we do is cross our fingers and cry, we’ll find ourselves in the same situation after the next accident. So lets embrace the sarcasm, even if many don’t understand it or haven’t yet learned to see it’s use or application.
Start the fire of change, or cry about it and wallow in your mange.
Pedestrians should stay on the sidewalk.  Yeah, sooner or later you need to cross a street and risk your life.
No one should be driving so fast down McClintock that they cannot stop for pedestrians or bikes.  The area is full of pedestrians and drivers (and bikes) are supposed to yield to pedestrians.
This campus is becoming a death trap.  The safety of the staff, faculty, and students, as well as visitors – school children,  old and disabled people who come to the dental clinic, etc. is not being taken seriously.   I can’t believe that the USC leaders can allow themselves this exposure .  Maybe it’s time to join together and demand a safety policy.   Cars shouldn’t even be on campus.  The remaining parking lots should be moved, or use only entrances from outside streets.  And there should be bicycle paths to protect pedestrians from speeding bicyclists.
As someone who has the displeasure of having to navigate my car through campus, I am not surprised something like this happened. People are frequently stupid–I can’t tell you how many times I have almost hit someone who decided they had the right of way in the middle of the street (no cross walk). Or how many bikers have popped up out of no where and passed right in front of my car, with me very narrowly missing them.
The road is made for vehicles–and if bikers want to be considered vehicles, they have to act like it and actually follow the damn rules. Sidewalks are made for pedestrians. And if pedestrians want to be treated as such, they should also follow the damn rules.
Random jaywalking, biking in the middle of the road (or even on the wrong side of the road), zig-zagging across the road on a skateboard, etc. are all incredibly stupid decisions–especially directly by a major parking structure on campus that has constant *vehicular* traffic in and out.
Yeah, it sucks that something like this happened. And I really hope everyone involved is okay. But at the same time, people need to start paying more attention.
If you have to explain satire/sarcasm that thoroughly to someone, perhaps the sarcasm is ill-placed in the first place…
I hope that the professor and student are doing fine.
Wow, somebody doesn’t understand what sarcasm is. This is college people, use some critical thinking skills. The second comment from “driver” is clearly critiquing the reported DPS response and the coverage of this incident by Daily Trojan reporter Nancy Martinez.
A lot of things went wrong, from the accident, to the alleged response and finally, the reporting. A little sarcasm helps embarrass people when they make mistakes, so they are more careful after the social taunting. This is a classic persuasion technique, straight out of the Marshall sub rosa book of leadership.
Who cares?  She’s just a pedestrian: obviously not as important as someone driving a car.  Chalk it up to experience, and tell her to quit whining about her so-called “injuries.”  
Do we know how much damage she did to the victim’s car by so recklessly colliding with it?  Like Officer Carlisle said in the article, cars have priority on campus, (especially at stop-signs, like the ones in front of Gerontology) and the professor should have exercised more caution, so the repair bill ought to come out of her paycheck.  
If anything, this incident shows how important it is for DPS to ticket anyone riding a bike or walking in the McClintock corridor (especially near Jefferson).  If we could simply convince more people to stop engaging in those dangerous activities, we’d all be a lot safer.  I, for one, applaud the rapid response from DPS to catch this lawbreaking faculty member.
And, in case anyone is wondering about the editorial stance of the The Daily Trojan, you can tell that they agree with everything I’ve written by their use of the passive, blame-deflecting statement “… student’s car struck her,” instead of the more accurate “… was struck by a student driving a car.”  Loves me that editorial bias.
There is a lot I would like to say about the previous comment, but I will keep this short as I refuse to engage in a debate with ignorance. 
How would you feel if it had been a friend or family member of yours crossing the street who was hit by a car? This is a tragedy for all parties involved, and hopefully a lesson learned by all as well. 
It is disgusting to me that you seem to value some humans’ lives and livelihoods over others’. Please think again before sharing your grossly biased and outrageously insensitive comments.
do we know who the professor is?

Angels & Airwaves is taking America by storm, starting with The Bamboozle musical festival. With its unique sound and growing fan base, this band is here to stay.
Love · The band — fronted by Blink-182 guitarist Tom DeLonge — released its third studio album last month. - Photo courtesy of Suretone Records 
Angels & Airwaves got its start in 2005 when high school friends Tom DeLonge and David Kennedy teamed up. Although they had been friends for years, each belonged to separate bands. Kennedy had focused on punk music, while DeLonge was a part of arena rock outfit Blink-182.
“We both hit a wall, and we talked about what we wanted together and agreed that music might play a part in our futures,” said Kennedy, guitarist for Angels & Airwaves.
Kennedy joined the group after performing with different bands including Blink-182, the Offspring, Box Car Racer and 30 Seconds to Mars.
The band also includes vocalist and guitarist Delong, drummer Atom Willard and bassist Matt Watcher.
“I joined because of my buddy Tom,” Kennedy said. “We both wanted to branch out, and we worked really well together.”
Angels & Airwaves has always been an original band, beginning with the creation of its name. Kennedy said the band wanted a name that stood out and blended well with its music.
“We wanted a cadence, a flow, something definitive to our band and our sound,” Kennedy said.
DeLonge thought of the name out of the blue, and over time it morphed into the perfect choice because of the band’s musical style.
“Our name sounds like our music — ‘angels’ for the angelic vibe, our music is a spiritual trip, and the airwaves is how we give it to the audience,” Kennedy said.
The band began recording in the studio almost immediately after itsformation. Angels & Airwaves soon locked in on a sound that stands out in the ever-changing music industry.
“It’s very big, it’s very instrumentative, it’s orchestrated on so many different levels,” Kennedy said. “It’s still driving, still rock ‘n’ roll, but with delayed rifts.”
Although it’s the music that keeps the band alive in the hearts of its many fans, the friendship is what keeps the musicians going. Because Angels & Airwaves is made up of four friends, the arrangement allows them to harness one another’s musical talents to make memorable music.
“We are all friends,” Kennedy said. “It’s very unique, the passion and the desire that we have.”
Kennedy said the friendship and creativity is what shaped the band into the ensemble that exists today.
“We are so hands on; we don’t leave things up to other people,” Kennedy said. “We try to do stuff on all different platforms. We are all a part of the band, but we also partner ourselves with other great people in all different facets of creativity.”
These platforms are what have allowed Angels & Airwaves to become a well-rounded band. One of the band’s more exciting recent ventures was its work on a film called Love, a movie both inspired by and featuring music from the latest Angels & Airwaves album of the same name.
Love, expected to come out later this spring, is a science-fiction film that follows an astronaut through a series of emotions. He feels abandonment and resentment until he ultimately discovers that there is more to life than what he previously thought.
“We aren’t in it, but our music is,” Kennedy said. “It’s what pushes him and the movie forward.”
The music in the film is from the group’s most recent album, also entitled Love. Love, the group’s third album, was released on Feb. 14. With its rich orchestration and comparatively more thoughtful lyrics, the record proves Angels & Airwaves has grown as a group and matured as a band.
Kennedy said this album was the next logical step forward, given the band’s discography.
“[Love was] a continuation of being innovative technically, marketing wise, musically and everything else,” he said.
As a band, Angels & Airwaves has set out to change music. The four musicians started with a goal to create music that had a driving force behind it. After creating its first two albums, We Don’t Need To Whisper in 2005 and I–Empire in 2007, the band still wanted more. With the release of Love, the band finally succeeded in accomplishing many of its goals.
“I’ve always wanted to have the chance, that we have, an opportunity for people to look back at something and mention our name,” Kennedy said.
With the hype surrounding the band’s most recent CD release and the upcoming movie release, Angels & Airwaves has a chance to cement its name in the pop-punk catalogue. The music and sound make it an outstanding and memorable band.
“I believe when you hear us it’s our own sound,” Kennedy said. “It lives and breathes on its own.”
Adding to its already successful year, Angels & Airwaves will kick off its 2010 world tour starting March 27 at The Bamboozle music festival in Anaheim, Calif. After this first gig — co-headlined by AFI and Something Corporate — Angels & Airwaves will continue touring until the end of May.

While earthquakes, health care reform and Tiger Woods have dominated mainstream news in the last months, there’s another story that has been steadily making waves in the international and online world — Google vs. China.
In January, Google claimed to be the victim of a hacking attack that originated from computers in China. In response, it decided to go against a 2006 deal it had with the Communist country and no longer filtered search results on the Chinese version of its website.
China retaliated by demanding stronger filters and threatened to block Google from its citizens. Most recently Google made its final push for power in the struggle by rerouting all Chinese searches through its uncensored Hong Kong servers, effectively bypassing Chinese filters.
Although China could simply block any Chinese user from accessing the Hong Kong servers, that is besides the point. Google’s actions have shown how far the company is willing to fight for Internet freedom.
The Internet has been in a kind of limbo with lawmakers and companies — they don’t know how to treat it. It’s a tool for social networking and mass communication, yet it’s also a host for television and music. Plus it’s full of information, from published resources including PEW studies, articles from major magazines and participatory websites like Wikipedia.
Because it is a medium in which freedom of speech can run rampant, governments such as China’s are attempting to manipulate or suppress information on the web. They have blocked websites that discuss the Tiananmen Square protests, the outlawed Falun Gong spiritual sect and even social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter.
China’s actions cut off communication with millions of people and tried to rewrite cultural perceptions through information and meme control. The Internet is just a modern form of communication, as phones and mail were before it. The idea of censoring the mail is ludicrous, just as censoring the Internet should be.
During the first conflict between China and Google, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke about the United States’ Internet policy. Extending the First Amendment to the Internet, she said, “the freedom to connect is like the freedom of assembly in cyberspace.”
There is a bit of a gray area when it comes to Internet freedom, though. Google, complying with German law, blocks any pro-Nazi website in the country. Similarly, there are many websites on the web that are from pro-hate and terrorist groups. Should they be repressed or should freedom of speech extend to all users on the Internet?
Like in the real world, people can say what they want — it is actions that are criminal, not speech. So, although we may not agree with what is on the Internet, we should not compromise free speech simply to stop cases here and there.
China blocks social networking sites out of fear that people will share information. That fear isn’t unfounded — just look at what sites like YouTube and Twitter did during Iran’s elections last summer.
The Iranian government kicked all foreign reporters out of the country, yet the citizens still shared videos, articles and pictures through the web.
The Internet served as a platform for mass communication and helped highlight the oppression that occurred in the country.
And even if governments choose to censor sites, people will find a way around it. In China, 384 million people use the Internet, and there is a vibrant illegal file-sharing culture. People have a taste for what the Internet offers, and they are going to try to get more of that, no matter how illegal it may be.
Oppression gives rise to rebellion. In America, file sharing and Wi-Fi hacking emerged out of a desire for free services. Just imagine the ingenuity and efforts going on in China to obtain free and uncensored Internet access.
Thankfully, our government has moved toward promoting Internet freedom. In addition to Clinton’s comments, a bipartisan group of senators formed the Senate Global Internet Freedom Caucus. The group formed soon after the Treasury Department authorized U.S. companies to send social media services and software to other countries to promote global communication.
So, while Google’s war over censorship in China might or might not come out in its favor, Internet freedom is at least being talked about. The more people realize that the Internet is an extension of speech and information, the more they will realize that those should not be censored or oppressed. China may pull the plug on Google, but sooner or later, its hold over the Internet will collapse. There are already dozens of cracks in the levee. The only question is how soon until the dam bursts.

If games were won and lost on paper, the madness that ensues in March would likely disappear into oblivion.
And while the No. 7 USC men’s volleyball team’s 6 p.m. match against the Grand Canyon Antelopes lacks the flair and unpredictability of another collegiate sport this time of year, the concept of not overlooking an opponent still applies — even if that opponent hails from a Division II school.
Unpredictable · USC coach Bill Ferguson has seen his team go from No. 1 in the nation to hovering near .500 over the course of the season. - Gage Allard | Daily Trojan
For the Trojans (10-9, 8-8), tonight’s match with GCU (14-19) couldn’t come at a better time. While the month began with optimism and renewal, the team has fallen on hard times. As most of the university’s students took the last week off for spring break, it seems USC’s most recent performances reflected a similar mental and physical hiatus.
The Trojans traveled to Provo, Utah last week to face the No. 4 Brigham Young University Cougars, and despite early season success on the road, the team’s trip proved to be neither business nor pleasure. They dropped two matches in rather disappointing fashion (3-1, 3-0) and tied their season-high losing streak of three matches.
As for Grand Canyon, this season hasn’t exactly panned out the way the team had hoped. After a disastrous first season at the helm of the ’Lopes, in which he saw his team go 4-25, Chad Speer created a schedule that he hoped would challenge his players. This season, GCU has taken road trips to play several Division I schools, including Ball State, Pacific, Ohio State and Pepperdine. And while the team has yet to win more than one set in any of those matches, a trip out to Southern California this week to face UCLA on Wednesday and USC on Thursday is all part of Speer’s plan to instill confidence in a program still looking to make a name for itself in Division II athletics.
Aiding the Antelopes in their rebuilding process are two emerging stars, outside hitter Brock Hutchins and setter Brad Moore, who the  team will rely on if they hope to make a dent on this upcoming road trip. Hutchins, a converted beach volleyball star, leads the team in kills (502). Moore, a local from Orange, Calif., enters tonight’s match with 57 kills and 200 digs on the season.
For USC, the task at hand seems highly manageable: End a three-game losing streak against arguably the least experienced opponent it has faced all season. And with a schedule that included the likes of UC Irvine, BYU, Hawai’i and Cal State Northridge, who could blame the team if it chooses to overlook the Antelopes.
Nevertheless, the Trojans have not been shy about letting people know that they have not even begun to assume a “W” will be etched beside tonight’s match. If this championship-starved team has learned anything in the midst of a highly rigorous schedule, it’s that a sense of entitlement ceases to exist once the whistle is blown.
“The match is just as important as any other,” junior outside hitter Tri Bourne said. “We have prepared for GCU the same way we prepare for all the other teams. Every game is just as important as the next at this point in the season.”

One of tonight’s Sweet 16 matchups will pit Cornell against Kentucky in perhaps one of the best examples of brain against brawn.
Kentucky has four players who will be eventual NBA lottery picks. Cornell backup forward Eitan Chemerinsky can solve a Rubik’s Cube in three minutes.
Not since the Notre Dame-Miami “Catholics versus Convicts” game have we seen such a stark contrast between two schools in a high-stakes match.
Improbable matchups like this are supposed to be what the NCAA tournament is all about. Everyone loves a good Cinderella story.
But you can bet that the folks at the NCAA would like to see Cornell and other mid-majors bow out before the weekend.
Underdogs are commonly embraced in March, but not by the folks running the tournament. Teams from outside the traditional power conferences make for a nice storyline in the first two rounds of games, but they worry the event’s organizers  when they advance further than that.
The reason, of course, is money. Mid-majors don’t drive up television ratings. They don’t sell tickets. They don’t create a buzz.
And so they have to go.
Don’t believe the deck is stacked against them? Just look at how schools from small conferences are seeded once they earn their bids. Cornell took on all comers this season and posted an impressive résumé, but the Big Red was still slapped with a 12 seed. Meanwhile, Florida, one of the final teams to make it into the field, was still somehow pegged as a 10 seed.
Worse yet, mid-majors are frequently pitted against each other in the first round of games. This year, teams like Butler and Northern Iowa had to pick off one of their own kind before advancing to face power conference teams.
And making the field without an automatic bid is treacherous for teams without branding power. If North Carolina, UCLA and UConn had shown any signs of life this season, they surely would have gotten the benefit of the doubt over a lowly team like Utah State.
College basketball’s mid-major quandary stems from the fact that it is driven by money and stars, especially since it became a daycare center for the NBA once the league banned players from entering directly out of high school. As popular as Cornell and St. Mary’s might be at this point, nothing will outdraw an Ohio State-Kentucky game that will be billed as Evan Turner against John Wall.
It’s safe to say that matches that feature future No. 1 picks will draw in more viewers than games that feature a surprise hero whose name no one knows how to spell. My hat’s off to you, though, Ali Farokhmanesh.
Maybe fans’ patience with small schools isn’t so thin, though. George Mason was embraced for the entirety of its historic Final Four run in 2006, as was Davidson in 2008.
But their popularity was easily explained. George Mason had a way of repeatedly one-upping itself with its performances. Davidson had a rising star in Stephen Curry. And both teams played entertaining styles of basketball showcased in several close games.
But any of the underdogs left in this field still have a ways to go before they reach that level of respect. Despite having one of the most efficient offenses in the country, Cornell’s basketball team still has to fight off the perception of being bookworms and Andy Bernard references.
Of course, the Revenge of the Nerds storyline is also bothering some Kentucky players. Kentucky forward DeMarcus Cousins told reporters at his Wednesday press conference, “It’s not a spelling bee.” Ah, spoken like Biff from Back to the Future.
After Northern Iowa upset Kansas, a Cornell takedown of Kentucky would make this the year of the mid-major. A final of Northern Iowa against St. Mary’s or Cornell might just make college basketball implode.
Hey, if your bracket is going down, you might as well take everyone with you.

When No. 1 USC women’s water polo returns to action tonight at McDonald’s Swim Stadium against foe Long Beach State, it should be a familiar setting for the Women of Troy.
Scorer · Senior Kally Lucas is the Women of Troy’s third leading scorer with 19 goals this season. Lucas’ four goals against California in the semifinals of the UC Irvine Invitational helped USC reclaim the No. 1 ranking. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
For the third time this season, USC (12-1, 2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will face the 49ers (7-12) — a team that they have enjoyed victories over thus far in 2010. In the team’s February season opener, the Women of Troy handily defeated Long Beach State 13-3, and, in the first round of the UC Irvine Invitational last month, USC notched yet another impressive win against Long Beach State 12-1.
Yet, despite the pair of wins, nobody is taking anything for granted.
“We treat all teams the same,” said senior two-meter and captain Kami Craig. “We can’t be overlooking any opponent, and we just have to have everyone match up where they need to be matched up. It’s just another game, and we need to focus on playing our game.”
Even with a familiar foe on deck, it’s been a while since the Women of Troy last took the pool in a regular season matchup. Because of scheduling logistics coinciding with the university’s spring break, it has been nearly three weeks since the team’s last game — a hard-fought 7-4 home win over No. 4 California on March 6th.
In the meanwhile, USC has relied on a St. Patrick’s Day scrimmage at Hawai’i and a demanding practice schedule orchestrated by USC coach Jovan Vavic in the hopes of keeping its number one ranking alive.
“Jovan has done a really good job at keeping us up on our conditioning and playing hard,” Craig said. “We had a scrimmage against [Hawai’i], which is a big physical team. We’ve just been hitting the weights hard and hitting the water hard.”
As the Women of Troy approach their conference matchup against the 49ers, one of the distinct advantages USC will enjoy is its top-notch defensive unit.
In their two prior matchups against Long Beach State, the Women of Troy gave up four goals. On average, the team allows 4.8 goals per game, and as a result, the two goals per game average demonstrates some of the advantages USC has against the 49ers.
In particular, senior goalie Tumua Anae has enjoyed some of her best performances of the season against the 49ers with impressive save totals, allowing only one goal in their last meeting.
But, as usual, it will take a team effort to get the job done.

On first impression, Alex Chu appears to be a stereotypical Trojan. A Northern California native, Chu is young and carefree. But to his employees and customers, he is more than just a college graduate — he is the proud and dedicated owner of the newly launched Dim Sum Truck and a budding entrepreneur.
Get some · USC graduate Alex Chu started his Dim Sum Truck last month. It can be found parked near campus most Thursday afternoons. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan 
Chu struck the food truck business while the iron was hot and — at only 22 — is currently one of the youngest food truck owners in the city. A 2009 graduate who majored in international relations and entrepreneurship, his wood-colored truck first rolled onto the streets of Los Angeles on Feb. 21, and business has been booming.
The concept is deceptively simple.
Dim sum is a popular Chinese cuisine that is often served on the wheels of a food trolley. However, good, authentic dim sum is not easily accessible for dumpling lovers in Los Angeles. Ordinarily served only during lunch hours, good dim sum is nearly impossible to find without trekking all the way to San Gabriel Valley, so Chu decided to break free from the constraints of time and location and get his dim sum onto the much bigger and mobile wheels of a truck.
“I just one day realized that there are no dim sum food trucks around, so I decided, why not open one?” Chu said.
If you think owning a food truck business is just about driving a brightly colored truck with customers trailing after it like with the ice cream man, think again. The time and energy needed to implement his concept was much more complicated than just buying a mobile kitchen.
“[A food truck] is a small business, but it’s the same as a big business,” Chu said. “You’ve got marketing, customer service, human resources, management, merchandising and so on.”
And from harnessing his business team to the finer details of designing his logo — which looks like a Chinese seal — Chu had to tackle all the responsibilities by himself.
“I do everything,” Chu said. “I market my truck, I market my product, I market my whole brand. I oversee the day-to-day operations, and I manage the accounting. I am doing basically everything besides physically making the food.”
Chu admits he is a business owner and not a chef. Even so, he is reluctant to call himself a true businessman because he says there is still much to learn. Chu is fresh out of college, with little business experience except for serving dim sum at a San Jose Asian fusion restaurant, doing a management internship with BLT Steak partner Brad Johnson and working with the opening team for Hollywood diner Kitchen 24. But what he lacks in age, savings and experience, Chu makes up for with what every college student surreptitiously does during lectures — social networking.

“If you know how to use Twitter and new media really well, that really helps,” Chu said.
For example, when Chu arrived at the intersection between Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street one Thursday afternoon, there was already a group of hungry customers waiting for him.
“[That Thursday] was a good day because I sent out an invitation to everyone through Facebook, so lots of people knew I was going to be there,” Chu said. “Then people make plans to come and try our food. It’s all about the new media now.”
Another key ingredient for his current success is his ability to pitch himself to the public.
“I actively searched out food blogs and journalists. I contacted them and sent them an information package. Because the combination of my pitching and my product worked, they responded well to it,” Chu said.
So far, major blogs like LA Weekly’s Squid Ink, Eater L.A., Grub Street Los Angeles, Deep End Dining and Food GPS have all given Chu favorable press. In addition, Chu made sure to advertise his products at the recent mobile food event, the L.A. Street Food Fest. Though his truck was not ready in time, he contacted the organizers asking for involvement and was granted a spot in the VIP Lounge to showcase samples of his food.
“I think that really helped get me more fans,” Chu said. “It was a great introduction to the food community.”
Chu was also lucky to find experienced cooks.
“I thought it would be hard, but it kind of happened that somebody I knew also knew somebody else, and so on,” Chu said. “It’s all about network connections. For example, when I was starting out, one of my helpers contacted me asking to help out. Everything just kind of happened.”
As for professional dim sum chefs who would need years of experience and training, Chu’s family friends helped him find them through recommendations.
With the essential elements in place, it is now up to the food to keep the business thriving. The menu is divided into two sections: a regular menu the traditional dim sum favorites like siu mai (a shrimp and pork mixture encircled by a wonton wrapper), har gow (a tapioca-wheat wrapped dumpling filled with shrimp and bamboo shoots), char siew bao (baked BBQ pork bun) and zong zi (steamed sticky rice filled with salted pork chunks, sweet Chinese sausage, dried shrimp and Chinese mushroom wrapped in lotus leaf). Dessert-type dim sum is also available, with egg custard tarts and deep-fried sesame seed-studded rice balls filled with lotus seed paste.
The second menu includes the specials, where Chu strays from tradition and creates his own native cuisine with fusions like the Peking duck taco and the spicy tofu mulita. Additions to this menu will be made frequently depending on Chu’s inspiration and whatever ingredients are available. He has recently featured a banana-red bean puff pastry, a buttery pie filled with the traditional red bean paste and gooey banana.
All items are made fresh each morning before service and steamed or fried before serving. The distinctive feature of the Dim Sum Truck, besides the innovative menu, is its special sauce that comes with the dim sum. It is Chu’s own secret sauce: a salty, sweet and spicy blend of oyster sauce, garlic, chili and other ingredients, which Chu will not reveal.
Christina Chen, a junior majoring in occupational therapy, braved the lines to get her dim sum fix after hearing about the truck from her friends.
“I haven’t had dim sum in such a long time,” she said. “I’m just so happy about the fact that I can have real, authentic dim sum come to me in this area. But I wish he served chicken feet.”
Though Chu himself is not fond of chicken feet — a ubiquitous dim sum dish of steamed chicken feet doused in black bean sauce — he plans to include it in his specials menu after receiving similar requests from several customers. If there was one thing he learned from his business venture, it is that passion flows both ways.
“You have to believe in what you sell, believe in your product,” Chu said. “But you also need the excitement of the customers to keep you going.”
Luckily for dim sum fans, Chu plans to keep up with his food truck business for at least a few years. He plans to eventually open his own restaurant one day, though he is still not certain about what kind of restaurant he wants.
“I’m just going with the flow right now, and see where life takes me,” Chu said.
For now, life will be taking him around the streets of Los Angeles in the Dim Sum Truck, touching the hearts and bellies of dim sum lovers with delicious dumplings, buns, tarts and, possibly, feet.
Alex, you gotta bring them CHICKEN FEET. If you wanna run an authentic dim sum on wheels, then you can’t overlook them CHICKEN FEET. I been feenin’ for those for like the longest time.
SWEET Chu. When I come back to LA, the first thing i am going to do is track your truck down and order! Where will your truck be during home football game?
Such a genius idea!  I’ve been missing quality dim sum, and I will definitely be finding Alex’s truck soon

The No. 13 USC men’s swimming and diving team will take on some of the toughest competition it has seen all season as it competes at the 2010 NCAA championships this week at Ohio State’s McCorkle Aquatic Pavilion this Thursday through Saturday.
Prepared · Senior James Martin will compete in his first NCAAs. - Heather Lee | Daily Trojan 
USC’s elite NCAA team includes of senior co-captains James Martin and Zoltan Povazsay juniors Clement Lefert, Richard Charlesworth, Dillon Connolly and diver Steven Starks; sophomores Jeff Daniels, co-captain Pat White and diver Harrison Jones; and freshmen Alex Lendrum and Nick Karpov.
“We are excited about our prospects this week,” USC coach Dave Salo said. “The goal is to move into the top 10 this year.”
Jones, an All-American, and Starks are the only returning NCAA point scorers for USC. Povazsay was an All-American on a relay as a freshman at West Virginia in 2007 and will be returning to the NCAA championships for the second time as a Trojan along with teammates Connolly and White.
Jones’ stellar performance at the 2010 Pac-10 championships, where he came first on the 1-meter springboard — USC’s first springboard title since 1999 — should give the sophomore confidence leading into this week’s competition.
Povazsay, Lefert, White and either Martin or Charlesworth (the final relay team is yet to be decided) are being counted on to start off the competition with a bang in the 800-yard freestyle relay, which USC won at the 2010 Pac-10s with a time of 6:19.17. The relay also saw Lefert break USC’s 200-yard freestyle record in the first leg, a time he broke again at the Pac-10 championships when he won the 200-yard freestyle individual event (1:33.75).
“We are also looking toward strong relay results — especially the 800-free relay,” Salo said.
Lefert and White are both ranked in the top eight in freestyle events. Both Trojans have had exceptional seasons and hope to finish it off with even stronger performances at the championships.
This week marks the last collegiate competition for Martin and Povazsay, who will be graduating in May, and for British teammate Charlesworth, whose NCAA eligibility expires at the end of this semester.
In his strong performance at the 2010 Pac-10 championships, Martin came in sixth in the 400-yard individual medley, but his preliminary time (3:45.96, a personal best) would have scored him second place overall.
Martin has the ability to go even faster this week in the 400-yard individual medley. He will also be competing in the 200-yard medley relay, the 200-yard backstroke and 800-yard freestyle relay.
Connolly still remains the team’s strongest breaststroker, owning school records for both the 100-yard (52.73) and 200-yard breaststroke (1:55.57) and is ranked among the top eight in the 100-yard breaststroke going into the competition.
“We are a much improved team from last year,” Salo said. “The guys are relaxed and looking forward to the start of the competition.”

Sometimes, all you need is faith and trust.
And having faith isn’t just trusting in Kobe Bryant to make the game-winning shot for the Los Angeles Lakers every single night.
No, this goes beyond that kind of faith and trust.
Experience · Before he left to join the Seattle Seahawks Rocky Seto spent 11 seasons working on the USC staff and was the defensive coordinator under Pete Carroll in 2009. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Haruki Rocky Seto served on the USC football staff for 11 years, dating back to when former coaches John Robinson and Paul Hackett ran things around town.
Seto recently left his post at USC and accepted a role with the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, but his career in football has been most notably characterized by his time at USC as a coach.
But his journey with USC did not begin that way.
In 1997, Seto transferred from Mt. San Antonio Community College to USC and walked onto the football team his junior year.
“I was very fortunate to walk on. I thank God that coach Robinson allowed me to play,” Seto said. “I am very grateful that he gave me that opportunity.”
During his senior year, Seto was awarded an athletic scholarship, and after the season he had intentions to attend graduate school and become a physical therapist.
Even though his parents wanted him to pursue a graduate degree, he felt there was another career waiting.
“I felt I was led by the Lord to go into coaching. I talked to coach [Paul] Hackett, he let me volunteer on staff and God gave me the opportunity,” Seto said.
Throughout the years, Seto worked on the football staff with the safeties, linebackers and secondary.
But staying with Trojan football wasn’t  all easy.
In 2006, Seto was offered a job to coach for the NFL’s Buffalo Bills. But he decided to remain at USC, sticking to a promise he had made to a former USC football player.
“The Bible says, ‘Let your yes be yes, and your no be no,’” Seto said. “I told [him] I won’t leave for the NFL. Just worry about school and football. You don’t have to worry about me.”
Seto still decided to stay at USC even after former offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian offered him the defensive coordinator position at Washington two years later.
Last year he was rewarded and promoted to be the defensive coordinator for one of college football’s top programs.
But Seto didn’t really think of jockeying for a spot at the top.
“It was never my intention to become [defensive coordinator]. I always wanted to do my best. Whether I was a walk-on player or even when I was a volunteer [assistant] getting coffee or making Xerox copies for the coaches … it just worked out for me and God kept opening up opportunities for me,” Seto said.
And one of those opportunities was being able to work with arguably one of college football’s greatest coaches in Pete Carroll.
“It was awesome working with [Carroll].” Seto said. “I learned so much about football, and I learned so much about coaching. It really was a blessed time working under him, and I couldn’t have asked for anything more.”
Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end.
Last season the Trojans football team won only nine games and played in a non-BCS bowl game for the first time in eight seasons, which seemed like an eternity to a program so used to winning.
And even though some people blamed the defense for losing close games throughout the up-and-down season, Seto’s unit didn’t suffer from a leader out of touch with his defense.
“Coach Seto had a tremendous football I.Q., and he knew our defense so well. He knew our defense as good as [anybody],” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said. “He was a really great listener, a great communicator and a great teacher.”
But Seto wasn’t just a coach to his players. He was something more.
“Seto was the type of guy you could always talk to and you knew he’d be real to you,” Galippo said. “You knew you could go to him and talk about real-life stuff that’s not just about football.”
After the Emerald Bowl win to end the 2009 season, Carroll decided to leave the dynasty he created for the NFL’s Seattle Seahawks, and the rest of the Trojan football staff was overhauled.
Unsure of what the future held, Seto held onto what he knew.
“You never put your hope in temporary things like your career and things that can change in the blink of an eye,” Seto said. “You need to put your hope in a thing that doesn’t disappoint, and that’s a relationship with Jesus Christ.”
Seto’s influential role on his players and the people around him was evident through his actions and words.
“He’s an influence on everybody,” Galippo said. “He has a lot of respect for his religion, and you could just really see his faith living through him.”
Though Seto is no longer part of the Trojan football staff, he is still part of the Trojan family.
From the time he walked onto the team his junior year of college until last season, Seto enjoyed every single minute.
“It has been a great 13 years at USC, and I feel fortunate that the Lord let this happen,” Seto said. “I’ve had my dream job for the last 13 years. My family and I are at peace with what has happened.”
Now, as the defensive quality control coach for the Seattle Seahawks, Seto might have a new job and new home but one thing is for certain — his faith.
“No one has to worry about coach Seto,” Galippo said. “His faith is so strong … He’s headed in the right direction.”
Sometimes, all you need is faith and trust — and that’s exactly what keeps coach Rocky Seto going.
He might be a great guy but as a defensive coordinator he wasn’t ready for the job. I’m glad to see someone else in charge of the defense
Why do you think he wasn’t “ready for the job?”
Did you watch the team last year??? Enough said. I like Seto as much as anyone, but there is no way he should’ve been the DC at USC.  He was just a yes-man to Carroll.  Everything he knew came from Pete.  So when something went wrong, obviously he would defer to Carroll.  We needed someone experienced who has had experience outside of SC at such an important coaching position.  
Rocky is now the defensive quality control coach with the Seahawks…I think it’s pretty clear that indicates there probably wans’t a lot of outside interest for his services at other schools.  Pete killed the golden goose the last couple years with the young assistants at the expense of experience and wisdom.
You make it sound like the defense was totally at fault for everything.  Obviously, that’s not the case.  You only point out the negatives but how many times did our offense fail us?
It is nice to hear positive things about Coach Seto.  USC was lucky to have him.  Coaches have a tremendous impact on their players.  It’s nice to see that he was such a good influence.  He seems like a really great person.  Wish him the best of luck in Seattle.

President Steven B. Sample gave USC trustees until August to name his successor; in December, they said they would take until June. But when the trustees abruptly ended their search on March 11 by naming provost and executive vice president C. L. Max Nikias USC’s next president, they made the right decision.
President Sample had an unparalleled run in USC’s history and perhaps in the history of higher education. As he leaves, now is the time for an insider — someone intimately familiar with USC’s campus and life — to guide the university through a new slate of challenges and opportunities. Nikias has been at USC since 1991, as an engineering professor, the dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering and eventually the provost. He knows that the fabric of our campus and the spirit of its students and faculty can be as important as any ranking.
For the last 20 years, USC has faced many external tests. It has toiled to match up against the nation’s top universities and attract exceptional students from across the country and the world. As he continues these efforts, Nikias is the man best suited to look inward. Better than any other candidate, he can lead USC’s ambitious plan for expansion north of Jefferson Boulevard, the university’s Master Plan. He can foster a student body and campus, finishing the awkward transition away from being a commuter school. He can ensure that USC emerges as the jewel of a Downtown Los Angeles still trying to figure itself out.
One area where Nikias hopes to mimic Sample is USC’s endowment. Despite Sample’s prolific fundraising efforts — the president raised the endowment from $470 million to $3.7 billion during his tenure — USC’s per-student endowment is still dwarfed by the high-profile institutions Sample loves comparing USC to. As USC prepares for the next phase of a major capital improvement plan, a far sturdier endowment will be crucial, and Nikias is right to make doubling our endowment a clarion goal.
Nikias is not the administrator most well known to students. For us, the provost can sometimes seem out of sight, even obscure. But as a 19-year veteran of our campus, he will be able to forge a connection with students and make himself a visible presence on campus. He’s already part of the Trojan Family, and he knows what the concept means to the students, faculty and staff here — and why it makes our school unique.
We applaud the selection committee for choosing Nikias because we believe he embodies the promise of USC’s potential and has the vision to realize it.
Let me get this straight… According to the Daily Trojan (Feb. 11, 2010 – “Endowment amongst hardest hit in U.S.”:
The study, conducted by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), found that the endowments at universities nationwide lost an average of 18.7 percent in value. USC lost 25.6 percent in endowment funds — nearly 7 percent more than the national average. That 25.6 percent translated into a $1.2 billion loss between July 2008 and June 2009.
“The survey is in its 39th year, and this is the largest decline we’ve seen in its history,” NACUBO’s director of research and policy Kenneth Redd said.
USC ranked 22nd among the schools that suffered the worst endowment losses with Syracuse, Baylor College of Medicine, Harvard, Yale and Carnegie Mellon leading the pack.
USC was also ranked the 8th worst managed endowment by 24/7 Wall St., which based its rankings on absolute dollar gain and loss, percentage gain and loss and the greatest percentage and dollar gains and loses among the largest endowments.”
Given that this happened inside of 13 months on Dr. Nikias’ watch; How does this translate to: “Nikias the right choice for USC..” ?
In the real world, officers of such a going concern would be fired and/or face criminal charges.

The unofficial relationship handbook describes multiple ways to break up with a significant other: via Facebook relationship statuses, texts, instant messages and Post-it notes.
But when it comes to friends, there isn’t much literature about how to go about ending a relationship. When two friends have an argument, they deal with the matter alone. Most people aren’t pushing them to stay friends or to go to therapy to work toward reconciliation.
But when the issue is about a love interest, friends and family are on the sidelines calling the shots and encouraging both parties to work things out. So how do you know when a relationship with a friend is worth fighting for or if it’s time to let go?
Many students said losing touch with old friends has become a part of the natural cycle of growing up and moving on to different stages of life, such as college.
“I try to make an effort [to keep in touch], but it’s definitely hard and it gets harder every year,” said Steven Kim, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism.
Rather than going home and seeing friends, many students relied on the Internet during spring break to keep up with their friends’ lives.
“I went on the trip with people from ’SC, so I didn’t get a chance to meet up with a lot of people,” Kim said.
Some students said they view college as an adequate excuse for ending a friendship from before that they were unsatisfied with. Others said with all the focus they put into their studies, they do not have the time to talk to old friends.
“I’m in school, and I have to study to get my grades,” said Jac’Quez Page, a freshman majoring in psychology. “If you can’t be OK with that, then we just can’t be friends.”

For those who have ended friendships on bad terms in the past, students unanimously recommended the same advice for those who might deal with failing friendships in the future.
“Be totally honest. If somebody wants an answer about why you’re not talking to them … answer even if it’s not totally positive,” said Sharon Louisell, a senior majoring in sociology. “At least just give an honest answer so that person won’t be left in the dark.”
Louisell said a friend “broke up” with her unexpectedly by refusing to answer her phone calls or reply to her messages. By informing friends about their worries or unhappiness, Louisell said students might have a chance to salvage their relationship.
“You just become an enemy if you’re not helping them,” she said.
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal discussed several celebrities who had falling outs. John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie, and Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter ended valuable friendships because they could not resolve their issues.
The article offers several pieces of advice for those who are considering ending a friendship. It recommends giving yourself time to calm down before approaching a friend. The article advises that, as in marriages, friends should try a temporary separation because they might realize they want to get back together. In order to spare a friend’s feelings, people are urged to make up excuses why they cannot make time for a friend. Confrontation or an ultimatum should be a last resort for fear that the friendship might end forever.
A friendship certainly won’t last forever unless both parties make a little effort. Facebook is great for busy weeks like during midterms and finals, but without communication via telephone, video chatting or in-person meetings, students will not be able to keep their valued friendships.
Although the Wall Street Journal article makes some valid points, I ultimately agree with students when they assert that honesty is the best policy.
Without keeping friends in the know, we cannot expect them to understand why a friendship is ending. However, for those who agree that growing apart is an element of our natural progression, no confrontation is necessary.
Out of sight, out of mind, I suppose.
Danielle Nisimov is a sophomore majoring in public relations.  Her column “On The SCene” runs Thursdays.
I disagree Danielle. Sometimes it’s wise to “avoid” friends. Friends often times come around and tell you the SOS, their woes, problems, g/f or b/f problems, financial problems, the money they blew in Vegas that was supposed to be for tuition/books/or a new Macbook, etc. Go to Dr. Phil dammit!!!
An old high school friend whom I didn’t see since 2004 added me as Facebook friend a couple months ago. I “ignored,” not because I dislike him or anything. We’ve grown apart, we were acquaintances at best during high school, and I didn’t feel I really knew him. I’m not trying to add to my “number of friends” count on Facebook, I’m indifferent. 
Good friends are hard to come by.

The Senior Gift Advisory Board has announced that this year’s senior gift will be a solar thermal energy system for the Lyon Center Pool.
The solar thermal energy system, chosen by popular vote, will replace the pool’s current heating system with boilers that burn natural gas, according to a previous Daily Trojan article. Seniors began voting Feb. 23.
In an e-mail announcing the decision, members of the Senior Gift Advisory Board said the gift is one of few funding initiatives focused on improving sustainability on campus.
The money that the senior class donates toward the gift will be given to the USC Sustainability Office to  facilitate the construction of the heating system; USC will contribute over $250,000. The project will start in summer 2010, according to the senior gift website.
To get seniors to contribute to the gift, the advisory board has launched a fundraising campaign. The campaign started March 23 with an advisory board “meet and greet” at 21 Choices. Seniors received a coupon in the e-mail for a free topping at 21 Choices to help the fundraising effort.
The Senior Gift Advisory Board is hoping for a slight increase in participation than last year. According to the previous Daily Trojan article, last year’s senior class participation was 85.2 percent. This year the board hopes to reach 86 percent.
Seniors can individually donate money towards the gift online.

It appears as if USC will have representation in a 64-team tournament this spring, despite sanctions on the men’s basketball team and the denial of an NCAA at-large bid to the women’s team.
That’s right: New USC football coach Lane Kiffin will be competing in Esquire‘s Sexiest Woman Alive bracket.
The bracket pits 64 competitors in four “regions” or genres of entertainment (Sports, Television, Movies and Music & Fashion) in hopes of determining, as the title might indicate, the sexiest woman alive based on the magazine’s readers’ choice.
Now, one might think, Lane Kiffin’s a man, isn’t he? Well, while all signs point to the fact that he is, indeed, male, Esquire’s nomination aims to point out Kiffin’s past and associate it with feminine qualities.
Two months ago, Kiffin departed the University of Tennessee’s football program to take the coaching position at USC, much to the dismay of UT’s fans. Accordingly, his inclusion in the bracket seeks to make a mockery of this decision, suggesting that it was irresponsible and, as it happens, unmanly to abandon his post at Tennessee.
While the odds are heavily out of Kiffin’s favor to escape the first round, in such a scenario he would face the victor of the matchup between ESPN personality and No. 8 seed Erin Andrews and NASCAR driver and No. 9 seed Danica Patrick.
Voting is currently in progress.

USC’s Reggie Bush and Kim Kardashian split? Again?
The breakup buzz is true. E! News confirmed last night that the USC football legend and reality TV star have split once again.
Bush has been spotted in New York City for the past three weeks while Kardashian has been in South Beach shooting her show with sisters Kortney and Khloe.
So what was the issue this time? Sources said Bush’s discomfort in the spotlight and Kim’s busy schedule were the ultimate deal breaker for the two. The couple had just reunited after a short break up last August.
In recent photos of the power couple both seemed happy. Kardashian was by Bush’s side as he won the Super Bowl with the New Orleans Saints in Miami. They were also spotted having a great time vacationing in Costa Rica weeks later.
However, the couple – who first began dating in 2007 –mutually decided to part ways a few days ago and have agreed not to discuss the split in public.
Bush attended USC from 2003 to 2005. He was awarded the Heisman Trophy in 2005. He currently is a professional football player for the New Orleans Saints.
New details revealed about Sex And The City 2
Sex and the City 2 is sending Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon on a trip to the Middle East as they visit Abu Dhabi.
In the sequel, Cattrall’s Samantha Jones takes her friends along to Abu Dhabi, where her movie star ex is shooting an action film. The newly released trailer reveals that Carrie finds temptation in the desert when she runs into her own ex from the TV show, Aidan.
“This is probably the most time the characters have ever spent together,” Parker said in an interview at last week’s ShoWest convention.
The first Sex and the City far exceeded industry expectations two years ago with a $56.8 million opening weekend. The movie went on to top $150 million at the box office. Sex and the City 2 is slated to open in theaters on May 27.
Miley Cyrus makes Idol appearance as “mentor”
Miley Cyrus was this season’s first guest mentor on American Idol. Many fans were confused why she was chosen to fulfill a position that musical greats such as Elton John and Mariah Carey have previously held.
Fans have also commented that Cyrus’ teen style isn’t needed for this season’s contestants and doesn’t appeal to the show’s fan base. Of the 11 contestants left, three are teens: Siobhan Magnus, 19, Aaron Kelly, 16, and Katie Stevens, 17. Tim Urban is 20 years old.
“This appearance is about showing Miley the young adult, not Miley the tween star,” said one person connected to the Cyrus camp. “She’s in a tough situation though, because it’s going to be hard for a lot of Idol fans to not draw that comparison.”
Cyrus is currently promoting her upcoming new movie The Last Song, a romantic drama written by The Notebook author Nicholas Sparks, which also stars her current boyfriend, Australian newcomer Liam Hemsworth, as her love interest.
The Disney star will perform her hit song “When I Look at You.” Also, new couple Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato will sign their duet, “Make A Wave.”
What do you think about Cyrus being a mentor? Is she comparable to musical greats such as Mariah Carey or Elton John?
O-M-G!!!!!!!!! Aiden’s coming back???? Im so excited!!!
Regarding the “Sex and the City 2” blurb:
Some fans may not have wanted to know that “rumor, NOT FACT” that Aiden will be returning in the film. Next time, say **SPOILER ALERT** before.
