Last May, Whitney Hester’s family hosted an intimate family gathering in Texas in honor of her graduation from the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance. Yet, Hester couldn’t help but feel that her four years at Kaufman — where she had spent nearly every day in the studio rehearsing with her cohort and forming connections with her classmates — were left unfinished.
As the live graduation feed played during the gathering, Hester felt sad that she was unable to experience the ceremony in person with her parents and younger siblings, whom she said now also want to go to USC. She had been looking forward to her own graduation since 2019, when she was invited on stage during a previous Kaufman commencement ceremony to hand out gifts as graduates walked on stage.
With the University promising to host an in-person commencement ceremony once it was safe to do so, Hester always knew she wanted to return to participate in the ceremony. Having spent a lot of money on her commencement sash, class ring and dress, she was looking forward to celebrating with her family. When President Carol Folt announced in March that the University would hold a combined in-person ceremony for both the Class of 2020 and the Class of 2021, Hester felt she might finally get the closure she needed. 
“It doesn’t feel like it’s necessarily over, that closure hasn’t really happened yet,” Hester said. “It just kind of feels unfinished, if that makes sense. So I think having graduations … we were at least able to celebrate our four years. I get to see friends that I haven’t seen in a year. I get to see my professors I haven’t seen in a year now.”
Like many other students from the Class of 2020 who are now located across the country and around the world, Hester traveled from her new job in Atlanta, Ga., to participate in her commencement ceremony.
However, not all students were so quick to welcome the belated commencement ceremony.
Ope Abimbola, who received a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering last year, said the notice of commencement was last minute and made it difficult for some graduates and family members to arrange for travel plans and time off work. Some of them had already begun to move on.
Having returned home to Idaho after finishing classes last May, Abimbola said, originally, he was not sure if he would be allowed to participate in the commencement ceremony as the in-person commencement ceremonies were previously restricted to California residents. However, after the regulations changed to allow out-of-state students, Abimbola said he decided to attend to celebrate both his bachelor’s and master’s degree in materials engineering that he finished in 2021. 
“Just being able to walk across the stage is pretty nice,” Abimbola said. “It’s just a good feeling to see all the things you’ve accomplished … after going through the whole motions of classes and everything, just the struggle of school and what that was. Being successful in that and being able to see people celebrate your success as well, I think is just a good feeling.”
After buying tickets last year to attend Class of 2020’s commencement ceremony “just for it to be canceled,” Abimbola’s father and younger brother will now be able to accompany and celebrate with him a year later. 
For many members of the Class of 2020, the in-person commencement ceremony was also an opportunity to reunite with friends, former classmates and roommates. Trevor Sochocki, who received a bachelor’s degree in journalism last year, said he looks forward to picking up where he left off with his friends after moving to Michigan for a job in the broadcast journalism industry.
“I look forward to, over the next couple days, seeing other people and catching up before we all have to leave again,” Sochocki said. “Being in Michigan means that I don’t get to see a lot of college friends in-person very often, if at all, so it’s nice to come back, and I’m very excited for all of the catching up that I have to do.”
After on-campus classes were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, Sochocki and his friends began holding virtual poker nights to keep in touch with one other, bonded by how the coronavirus pandemic changed their senior year. Sochoki said he looks forward to seeing his friends from the Class of 2021, who will also be participating in the ceremonies, and feeling the nostalgia of being on campus one last time.
“There’s definitely an element to college kind of being the good old days,” Sochoki said. “Never in our lifetimes again will there be a point where we’re all in half a square mile of school, a bunch of people within the same age as us and a bunch of people that are in the same period, the same space of thinking, as well … You don’t get to have a time like college ever again — which is why it’ll be special.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Trevor Sochoki’s name as Trevor Sochocki. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

When Mariana Fontoura started her master’s degree in social entrepreneurship in Summer 2019, she never imagined that she would spend most of her degree program online after USC transitioned to virtual learning in March 2020. Fontoura, a 2021 graduate, like many other international students, is unable to attend her in-person commencement ceremony. 
Originally from Brazil, Fontoura moved to Los Angeles for the MSSE program in 2019 before moving back to her home country at the end of 2020 to start working. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Brazil is currently still at the highest level of risk regarding the coronavirus. As a result, many countries around the world, including the United States, have imposed restrictions against Brazilian travelers because of the Brazilian coronavirus variant. The U.S. has also banned people who have been in Brazil in the last 14 days, with exceptions granted to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Academic student (F-1) visa holders are not exempt from this new restriction. 
Fontoura said with coronavirus cases in Brazil being terrible, she is sad that she will not get the opportunity to celebrate in person with the rest of her cohort. Due to the four-hour time difference between L.A. and Brazil, Fountoura said she will also not be able to attend the virtual graduation ceremony due to work. 
“I was expecting to have this opportunity to meet my classmates because I knew that all the experience that I had during the master’s [program] wouldn’t be possible to relive … because I had a lot of classmates from all around the world,” Fontoura said. “I was expecting to have this reunion, and for me, it’s really sad that I won’t have this opportunity, and I don’t know when I will have the opportunity to see my classmates again.” 
Although Fontoura will not be able to attend both her in-person and virtual commencement ceremonies, she is celebrating her accomplishment with an online brunch with other Brazilian students in her cohort who are unable to attend the ceremonies either. 
Novalino Idrus, an international student from Indonesia, was also unable to attend the in-person commencement ceremony. 
Idrus, who received master’s degrees in engineering management and business analytics in December 2020, assumed commencement would be online and made the decision to move back to Indonesia in March. However, right before he left, President Carol Folt announced that USC would be holding in-person commencement ceremonies. Although Idrus considered postponing his move, he ultimately decided to return home because he was starting a new job, and said that if he had stayed in L.A., the 14-hour time difference was “not good for [his] body.”
However, Idrus decided to attend the virtual ceremony held by the Viterbi School of Engineering. Due to the time difference, Idrus said he woke up at 5 a.m. and watched the ceremony on his laptop in his room by himself. 
“I actually joined the Viterbi [ceremony] for my department, but … it was just like a video recording, so they just played people talking, and they just really [did] the same, like what they did last year,” Idrus, who attended the Class of 2020’s virtual ceremony last May, said. “I thought it would be different because they already learned about the situation. I thought there was going to be more festivities.” 
Anushka Sapra, a 2021 graduate who majored in international relations and political economy, was able to attend the in-person commencement ceremony. However, her family in India were unable to attend due to India’s ongoing coronavirus crisis. 
Sapra said that during the days leading up to commencement, she saw “so many parents and families in the village and walking around with their kids.” 
“It was a lot harder in the days leading up to graduation,” Sapra said. “I guess that was when I was really missing my family, but it’s okay. They really enjoyed the virtual celebration and they watched it, and I called them and being in the [Los Angeles Memorial] Coliseum and graduating felt surreal for me itself.” 
Sapra, who last saw her family in December 2019, plans to return to India in June. With the recent large-scale coronavirus outbreaks in India, Sapra knows she won’t be able to celebrate much or go outside. Nonetheless, she is excited to be able to see her family again and have dinner together with them.
“I feel like it was really hitting me that this was the end of a really, really big chapter in my life and something that was only possible because of my family and all of their sacrifices,” Sapra said. “The fact that they weren’t able to be there to see me graduate and see me finish what they sacrificed so much for was … a really awful feeling, but at the end of the day, it was much safer for them to be home.”

With socially distanced chairs dotting the field of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and a total of 14 in-person ceremonies held by individual schools taking place over one week, the USC Class of 2020 and the Class of 2021’s commencement looked a bit different than commencement ceremonies held in previous years. 
Ceremonies were live broadcasted through the virtual event platform 6Connex. The platform also featured on-demand recordings of each ceremony, a digital copy of program books for both classes, a virtual processional and an online photo booth. 
In her commencement address, the first of the week, President Carol Folt acknowledged the 38,000 graduates being celebrated this year. She also recognized the events of the past year, including the coronavirus pandemic and national outcry against racism, hate and social injustice. 
“Here at USC, I am inspired daily by the courage and the perseverance that I see,” Folt said. “I have been deeply moved as I watched you discover new opportunities to contribute and grow, even during these difficult times. Whatever its impact, COVID didn’t derail or defeat you. It certainly didn’t define you.” 
Folt announced USC’s plans to host in-person commencement ceremonies for both classes in a Universitywide email in mid-March. Originally, the ceremonies were limited to California residents, before it was expanded to include all students on April 9. 
“I think that the fact that they were able to even give us an in-person commencement was really great,” said Gregory Huffman, who received a master’s degree in physician assistant practice. “It might not have been as functional as last year or run as smoothly as other years, but it was something.” 
Each student was allowed to invite two guests to the in-person ceremony, who were required to be either California residents or fully vaccinated. Guests were seated, socially distanced, in the stands of the Coliseum.
Kelley Lu, who received a master’s degree in physician assistant practice, invited her two parents to her in-person ceremony. Lu said that because her parents are both vaccinated and residents of Los Angeles County, the process of bringing them to the ceremony was “a little bit less complicated.” 
For Omar Amezquita, who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in political science in 2020, the guest limit meant his younger brother was unable to attend the in-person ceremony. 
“My mom, dad and my brother were the most important ones for me to have there, and it sucked that my brother wasn’t able to make it,” Amezquita said. “Most of the motivation that I’ve had throughout school and through every challenge that I’ve been through was to set an example for him and at the end of the day, to not have him there was really disappointing.”
The ceremonies were hosted at the Coliseum twice a day for one week, with a majority of the speakers and performances presented through videos.  
During the ceremony, Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, who received a bachelor’s degree in psychology and a progressive master’s degree in social entrepreneurship, spoke about being the first Black valedictorian at USC and about choosing to be kind and compassionate. 
“This past year, in the midst of COVID-19, we experienced how quickly and ferociously hate can spread and become its own pandemic,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “But we can choose not to be a part of it. In our future careers, future families and future relationships, we can choose to use the best parts of ourselves to see the best parts in everyone else.” 
Isabella Hauptman, the Class of 2020’s valedictorian, spoke about moving forward after the pandemic in her second valedictorian’s address. 
“Now, as we graduate, we are uniquely positioned to create … a future that is more sustainable, more equitable, more just, more empathetic,” said Hauptman, who received a bachelor’s degree in cognitive science in 2020 and a master’s degree in applied biostatistics and epidemiology. “A future centered around collaboration and innovation. A future that we can be proud of.” 
Commencement speaker and journalist Bina Venkataraman praised the graduating classes on their overcoming of trauma and adversity, both of world events and of their individual lives. 
“My fierce hope is that you will keep honing your talents, your knowledge, your work ethic, all of your rare gifts that have gotten you here today, but that you will also summon the courage to stand for the truth, to stand for others who need it and to let yourself imagine the possibility of things that others can’t see,” Venkataraman said. 
The ceremonies also included pre-recorded musical performances of the national anthem and an original song, “One More Smile,” from a student jazz ensemble in the Thornton School of Music. 
Lu said that given the current situation, she was “thankful to even have an in-person ceremony in the first place.” 
“It kind of felt like a combination of a normal graduation but also something you can see during COVID times,” Lu said. “It was an awesome experience.”

What’s been more up and down since my last column — the Los Angeles Lakers or Dogecoin?
It’s been a little over a month since I wrote about Los Angeles sports and things have been shaky, to say the least.
The Lakers have really stunk, holding a record of 8-9 during that time and losing some questionable games against the Sacramento Kings and Toronto Raptors — two teams holding real estate at the bottom of their respective conferences. 
A record like that threw Lakers faithful into a frenzy. Sure, they haven’t looked good during the last month, but it’s worth noting that this has simply been the fact that they haven’t been healthy at all. 
LeBron James, the main actor in “Space Jam: A New Legacy,” has only played four games since April 15 after suffering a high ankle sprain against the Atlanta Hawks. Having LeBron out for an extended period is bad enough for this Lakers team, but his co-star Anthony Davis missed just over two months with a calf injury. 
Throw that into a mixing pot and what you get is the unappetizing play of the Lakers in the last month. They’ve fallen into the seventh seed in the Western Conference, forced to be in the NBA’s new play-in tournament.
The Lakers are finally catching fire at the right time. They won five games in a row to close out the regular season, and seem to be gaining momentum going into the play-in tournament. They have their chance to keep going on a positive note, but there’s some risk. 
The tournament has its critics, notably LeBron, but it added an exciting factor to late-season basketball that’s been missing for a while now. It works pretty easily too. 
Whatever team is in the seventh slot in each conference, there are two conferences — the Western and Eastern — plays the team in the eight slot in their respective conference. And whoever is in the ninth slot plays the team in the tenth. The tournament is a knockout format, meaning if you lose, you miss the playoffs. However, there is a twist.
Let’s say the Lakers lose to the eighth seeded Golden State Warriors in their play in-game, meaning the Warriors are the seventh seed in the Western Conference. The Lakers will have another chance to make the playoffs. They’ll play the winner of the ninth and tenth seed game. The winner of that now becomes the eighth seed in the Western Conference. If you lose that game, you’re out of the playoffs completely. 
The same process happens in the Eastern Conference which creates so much confusion for some NBA fans they’d rather just go back to school.
It all seems like a nightmare scenario for the defending champions, but it’s far from that. The worst-case scenario is that the Lakers fall into the eighth spot and face the Utah Jazz or miss the playoffs. 
With all that being said, the play-in offers the Lakers a chance to get some reps together.
Prior to the Lakers game against the Indiana Pacers on Saturday, the starting lineup of LeBron, Davis, Dennis Schroder, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Andre Drummond had only played a whopping one game together.
Clearly, that’s not enough time to build chemistry between themselves on the court, let alone win an immediate playoff series. They need more reps, even if it’s just an extra game before a playoff series, which is imperative if they face teams like the Jazz and Phoenix Suns in the first round that’ve been healthy for most of the year. 
Most importantly though, it allows LeBron and company to get the rust off their game. Watching the previous three games, it seems like LeBron is in mid-season form, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. 
And for Head Coach Frank Vogel, he can finally take a look at a possible playoff rotation. It’s been practically impossible to figure out a rotation with so many bodies missing. But the play-in game is a perfect way to find the best lineups that work on the court.
It’ll take some luck and challenges, but if all the stars align, we’ll be wearing championship shirts once again this summer.

The No. 12 men’s tennis team kicked off their 2021 NCAA tournament run this month with their first two matches at home for the rounds of 64 and 32. 
They first started in the round of 64 by facing Grand Canyon Antelopes where they cruised with a 4-0 win, winning both in doubles and singles. Then, they had to go up against No. 28 Pepperdine Waves who previously ousted the Trojans earlier this season in a 4-3 win. 
Looking for revenge, the Trojans won in a decisive fashion: 4-2. 
USC first won the doubles points thanks to the No. 10 duo of senior Daniel Cukierman and redshirt senior Riley Smith who beat No. 71 freshman Guy Den Ouden and graduate student Adrian Oetzbach, 6-3. Sophomore Stefan Dostanic and junior Bradley Frye also won a close matchup 7-5 against juniors Corrado Summaria and Tim Zeitvogel to seal up doubles. 
In singles, the Trojans got a head start with early wins from No. 49 Cukierman and freshman Lodewijk Weststrate. However, the Waves fought back with Den Ouden beating No. 52 Smith, and Zeitvogel winning against Frye. 
Needing one more win, No. 116 Dostanic booked their ticket to Orlando by prevailing against junior Daniel De Jonge, 7-6 (12), 6-2.
At the USTA National Campus in Orlando, USC faced a tough matchup against No. 5 Virginia Cavaliers in the round of 16. 
Like with Pepperdine, the Trojans were able to start off with a quick lead winning doubles in two tightly-contested matches. The duo of No. 10 Cukierman and Smith were able to beat No. 14  graduate student Carl Soderlund and junior William Woodall, 6-4. Then, Dostanic and Frye were able to outlast the No. 89 doubles partnership of junior Ryan Goetz and freshman Chris Rodesch, 7-6 (5).
The match once again fell close in singles, with No. 52 Smith first upsetting No. 44 Jeffery von der Schulenberg in straight sets, 6-2, 7-5. 
However, the Cavaliers quickly responded back with senior Gianni Ross beating junior Jake Sands, 6-4, 7-5, and then No. 61 freshman Iñaki Montes de la Torre beating Frye, 7-6 (4), 6-2. These victories for Virginia tied up the overall match score at 2-2. 
Nevertheless, the Trojans persevered with Weststrate taking down No. 106 Goetz, 6-3, 7-5, and then No. 116 Dostanic once again sealed the victory for the Trojans against Rodesch in three sets, 6-3, 5-7, 6-2. Once again, the final score was 4-2. 
The sophomore Dostanic has been accustomed to delivering the final blow in singles as seen previously in the Pepperdine match in the Round of 32 and the Pac-12 finals against Arizona State. 
“I mean, look, he’s [Dostanic’s] up for the moment … he’s very competitive and he rises to that, to the occasion,” head coach Brett Masi said post-game about Dostanic’s ability to finish matches for the Trojans in the postseason. “He stayed the course, and he played a great third set to secure [the victory].” 
Now, the Trojans intend to seek out another upset against No. 4 Texas Longhorns in the quarterfinals who previously beat USC back in February at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships consolation semifinal match, 3-4. 
“I think the guys are going to be just pretty hungry to seek some revenge,” Masi said about the team’s motivation heading into the Texas matchup. “We just got to go out there and play the same tennis that we did today [against Virginia] where we take charge early and assert ourselves.”
The No. 12 Trojans will take on No. 4 Texas in the quarterfinals Thursday.

The perfect revenge to No. 1 USC’s only loss this season was beating No. 3 UCLA in the 2021 NCAA Championship final 18-9 this past weekend. It is the largest margin of victory and most goals scored ever in a NCAA women’s water polo championship game.
Right out of the gate, there was something different about the energy of the USC squad. The Trojans broke out early from a one-goal game in the first to a 10-4 lead at halftime, tying the most goals scored by a winning team in a NCAA final.
The offensive effort was driven by redshirt senior utility Maud Megens, earning six goals and three steals to solidify her place as the NCAA Tournament MVP. Right behind her in scoring were stellar performances from lefty senior driver Verica Bakoc, who managed to thread the ball in through a forest of shot blockers, junior utility Bayley Weber, who was always in the right place at the right time, and junior 2-meter Mireia Guiral, whose backhanded shot and kick-up while held by UCLA’s defender kept the control in USC’s hands. 
Redshirt senior driver Denise Mammolito, picking up a goal of her own, and Megens described this win as something the seniors wanted to leave for the underclassmen. 
“It’s been such a weird year, especially last year, and coming back here feeling like home, like coming home in L.A. with my team and where everyone has the same goal in mind,” Megens said. “And everyone’s there for each other. And really our underclassmen also made it possible for us to play today the way we did, and I hope they keep the tradition alive and go at it out next year when we’re not here.”
In the cage was a wall by the name of redshirt senior goalie Holly Parker, collecting a career-high 13 saves and a steal for the Trojans. Her strength set the defensive tone of the match, and UCLA was only able to take advantage of three out of seven powerplay opportunities. Parker earned a spot, along with Mammolito, on the NCAA All-Tournament First Team for the coordination.
This is the seventh national championship for USC women’s water polo, and the first for Head Coach Marko Pintaric under his pedagogy.
“All this is not me,” Pintaric said. “As a coach, I’m really proud to have really the best staff in my opinion that a coach can have. These people they put enormous time of work here between men’s and women’s team. And this is complete team effort. And then our team is a special group of young ladies, warriors, they came together.”

Summer is finally here! After months of horrific schoolwork culminating with grueling exams, it is time to relax and watch your ever-growing list of TV shows and movies you never got around to this semester. Sure, the list might be miles long from agreeing to add whichever show your Zoom crush recommended, but these six titles below are necessary line skippers and should be added to the top of your watch list. 
Disney +
High School Musical: The Musical: The Series Season 2
“High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” proves that there is shockingly still a Wildcat in everyone, no matter how long ago you last danced to “We’re All in This Together,” or tried to reenact “Bet On It.” 
Season 2 picks up with the drama club of East High riding high after the triumphant musical, which ends season 1. The first episode teases issues between the Troy and Gabriella of the show, Nini (Olivia Rodrigo) and Ricky (Joshua Bassett), and interesting character development from some of the best background characters from season 1. 
It feels slightly strange to be in college and watching a show where the purpose is to live through high school characters, but it is too fun to ignore. Season 2 of “High School Musical: The Musical: The Series” is joyful and lighthearted – the perfect way to completely forget about final exams and sink into the summer headspace. 
Disney + 
Star Wars: The Bad Batch 
“Star Wars: The Bad Batch” is the latest example of how Star Wars thrives on the small screen. The show features a group of misfit characters who managed to survive the Clone Wars and now take on daring missions across the galaxy. 
Taking place in the “dark times” under Imperial rule, “The Bad Batch” is a Star Wars fan’s first opportunity to learn more about the time following the “Revenge of the Sith” and before “A New Hope.” It provides the epic fight scenes necessary for any Star Wars franchise project. But, it is also heartwarming and compelling, two characteristics that are fundamental to any Star Wars show. 
Criminally underrated, “Star Wars: The Bad Batch” deserves so much hype and attention. And now that exams are over, there is plenty of time to delve into the Star Wars universe through this animated show. 
Peacock
Girls5Eva
Starring Sara Bareilles and Renee Elise Goldsberry, “Girls5Eva” is a spectacularly fun Broadway reunion. The show answers the question none of us had: what would happen if a one-hit-wonder from nearly 30 years ago experienced a revival? 
The new series features a girl group that has fallen out of public favor after their debut album on Sept. 10, 2001. However, when a hip-hop artist samples their work nearly 30 years later, they are once again hurdled into the spotlight with their dreams of stardom resurfacing. It’s Tina Fey’s triumphant return to television production and everything we all know and love about her shows. “Girls5Eva” is a fun and lighthearted way to decompress from the horror of final exams. 
HBO Max
Those Who Wish Me Dead
For fans of classic early 2000s blockbuster hits like “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider” and “The Mummy,” “Those Who Wish Me Dead” is the perfect summer movie. Audiences can watch Hannah (Angelina Jolie), a smokejumper in Montana, attempt to save the life of Connor (Finn Little), a young boy she encounters in the forest, from two men who are attempting to kill him. It is the perfect combination of an intriguing plot, epic action scenes and beautiful scenery that barely affects the plot but you still appreciate it anyway. 
Notably, after years of accepting smaller parts and focusing on voice acting, this is Angelina Jolie’s triumphant return to live-action films. Sure, it may not necessarily win her an Oscar nomination; but it is still a fun, action-packed movie that will make you feel like you are fighting in the woods in Montana, not nervously refreshing your OASIS portal praying that your grades are in. 
Netflix
Oxygen 
“Oxygen” is a French science-fiction film featuring a cryogenics scientist (Mèlanie Laurent), deep space and a race against time. It starts with a woman waking up in a cryogenic chamber, not knowing where she is or who she is but watching her remaining oxygen plummet. Now, it is a race against time for our unknown protagonist as she fights to save her life. “Oxygen” has all the makings of a great thriller film: an intriguing premise, good acting and surprising plot twists. 
Unfortunately, foreign films may seem off-putting to some American viewers, but you can get just as good a scare. Watching “Oxygen” might seem an intense way to end an intense final exam season, but do not let that dissuade you from it. This film is an underrated, must-see gem. 
Netflix
I Am All Girls
Based on a series of horrific events occurring in South Africa in the 1980s, “I Am All Girls” is a terrifying look into a child trafficking syndicate. The movie features an unlikely alliance between a detective and a killer who team up to take down an organization sex trafficking children. 
It is incredibly tough to take a story featuring such delicate subject matter and portray it with the necessary nuance and detail. However, “I Am All Girls” rises to this challenge and excels. Although worth watching for the incredible plot and execution, the true standout is Hlubi Mboya, whose performance as Ntombizonke Bapai is nothing short of extraordinary. It is unfortunate to see how little attention this film is getting; however, now that exams are over, there is plenty of time to watch this incredibly masterful piece of art.

Asian-American Pacific Islander artists have been at the forefront of combating prejudice and racism particularly in this country, and with the rise in racially-motivated attacks against AAPI, it is more important now than ever to amplify their voices. Though the fight isn’t over yet, AAPI artists are beginning to break through barriers into a new spot in western media. To celebrate AAPI Heritage Month, here is a list of eight promising AAPI music artists bound to top the charts.
keshi
Born as Casey Luong to Vietnamese parents, keshi is known for his soft mix of R&B, hip hop and lo-fi beats. He learned how to play the guitar at 13-years-old and began writing music shortly after. While working towards a nursing degree in college, keshi posted his self-written and self-produced music on SoundCloud. His songs, including this one in his signature lo-fi hip hop style titled, “if you’re not the one for me who is,” garnered traction, fueling his decision to quit his job as an oncology nurse and pursue a full-time music career. Since then, keshi has released four EPs and racks up 4.3 million monthly listeners on Spotify, a strong start to his multifaceted career.
Olivia Rodrigo
From “drivers license” and “deja vu” to the recently-released “good 4 u,” Olivia Rodrigo never misses. The Filipina American singer-songwriter and actress has taken the world by storm in the past year, and if you haven’t been screaming your lungs out to her bops, where have you been? Each single so far has taken a new direction in genre and style as Rodrigo explores the versatility and extent of her talents. Having recently performed at The BRIT Awards and Saturday Night Live, Rodrigo is growing bigger and better every day. Anticipation is at an all-time high for Rodrigo’s debut album, “Sour,” coming May 21.
Raveena
Raveena stepped into the spotlight in 2017 after releasing her debut EP, “Shanti.” Growing up in an Indian immigrant household in America, Raveena and her dreamy vocals blend R&B and soul with a hint of Bollywood. The singer-songwriter’s debut album, “Lucid,” follows the lucid trajectory of dwelling on, then letting go, her past trauma and pain. In her songs “Stronger” and “Salt Water,” Raveena opens up about her experience as a sexual abuse survivor, and “Mama” tributes her mother and grandmother’s journeys of escaping genocide in India. Raveena also sings about coming to terms with being bisexual and South Asian, two identities that she often felt clashed.
Alex Aiono
Born to a father of Samoan and Māori descent and a white mother, Alex Aiono released his debut single and EP in 2013. He gained more attention in 2016 for posting covers and self-produced mash-ups of popular songs on YouTube. By 2019, he signed to his second record label and released his genre-bending debut album, “The Gospel at 23,” the following year. Now, Aiono is working to expand his career while continuing to showcase his stripped-down R&B style and smooth riffs on YouTube, where he is nearing six million subscribers and a billion total views.
Stephanie Poetri
Born in Indonesia in 2000, Stephanie Poetri began her career in 2015. Her breakthrough came in 2019 with her single, “I Love You 3000,” released with her current record label, 88rising. The song gained worldwide attention with over 425 million streams online. Poetri won “Best New Asian Artist – Indonesia” at the 2019 Mnet Asian Music Award and later collaborated with GOT7 member Jackson Wang for the hit song’s remix, titled “I Love You 3000 II.” Following her success, Poetri released three more singles and her debut EP, “AM:PM,” blessing listeners with more of her fresh, sweet melodies marked by a warm acoustic tinge.
Saleka 
The oldest daughter of Oscar-nominated filmmaker and actor M. Night Shyamalan, Saleka grew up surrounded by art. Starting off playing classical piano, the Indian American musician expanded to singing and songwriting while studying at Brown University. In 2020, Saleka released singles “Clarity” and “Mr. Incredible,” proving herself as a rising R&B artist with her soft but powerful vocals and truthful lyrics. This year she released two more singles, “Graffiti” and “The Sky Cries,” along with a complementary music video directed by her sister and her father, respectively. With a strong start to her career, Saleka is set to release her debut album later this year. 
Aolani
Having attended a performing arts school, Aolani started out performing Hawaiian music with her ukulele at the age of 12, but has branched out to creating R&B music. The Hawaiian singer-songwriter released her self-titled debut album, the product of two years of work, in 2018. The album consists of eight songs full of intimate revelations based on her personal experiences in romantic relationships and love. Influenced by R&B music from the 90s and early 2000s, Aolani’s songs blanket listeners with a feeling of nostalgia and highlight her healing and soothing vocals.
Dominic Fike
A Black singer and rapper of Filipino descent, Dominic Fike first grabbed the public’s attention with his SoundCloud demos. He rose to fame in 2018 with his debut single “3 Nights” from his EP, “Don’t Forget About Me, Demos,” which he recorded on house arrest and released in jail. During his time in jail, Fike discovered a unique approach to writing music, experimenting with different sounds by banging on the sink. He signed with Columbia Records upon his release due to the EP’s success and released his first and top-charting album, “What Could Possibly Go Wrong,” in 2020.

Adapting to the current world situation, USC students found themselves adapting to the realm of virtual education. Students studying in the School of Dramatic Arts were presented with unique challenges and changes that impact the way they learned theatre during these unprecedented times.
Coming from unique backgrounds in theatre before USC, each student’s experience with moving to online learning has been notably different. 
“Before coming to USC, I went to an art school in Orange County, California, so I was brought up on technical theater, so all the background things like lighting, costuming, [and] set design,” said Emi Yoshino, a freshman majoring in stage management.
While students like Yoshino come from a more technical background, theatre at USC also encompasses the performance side of the industry. 
“I started theatre when I was very young,” said Gry Nyström, a freshman majoring in theatre with acting emphasis. “I used to write my own plays [and] have my grandparents perform them. I would also perform in church. When I moved to Italy, I would perform both in school and outside of school. Whenever I got the opportunity I would just perform.” 
Despite originating from multiple diverse backgrounds and experiences both in life and theatre, students studying theatre at USC all encounter new experiences when they first embark on their collegiate journeys.
“My first acting experience led me to meet my roommates, which was crazy … In my one roommate’s directing class, you needed two actors to perform the scene … we Zoomed and we did a scene together, and it was the first acting thing that I had done in a while and also the second thing that I had done on Zoom, so it was really interesting to have that experience,” said Grace Langan, a junior majoring in theatre.
In addition to developing connections that last outside of the classroom, students are also able to form bonds and memories during class to last them a lifetime.
“The first thing I remember is doing our stage management cohort meeting, which happens every Friday,” Yoshino said. “All the BFA stage managers hop on Zoom, and we just chat about our shows and how school is going. It’s a cute little get together we all have, so we can all keep each other in check.”
Attending virtual college has helped theatre students to further develop skills that otherwise may not have been noteworthy in person. Yoshino discusses how communication has become a necessary tool for her online learning.   
“Just being on Zoom, and then working shows on Zoom, communication is like the only way to make it through,” Yoshino said.
Besides communicating, students have also noted that more personal life skills, such as time and schedule flexibility, have improved during their time in SDA.
“Doing things online, you have to be open to things not going as planned and changing things. I’m in one of the SDA shows right now, and you have to not look at the people that are in the scene with you so that it looks like you’re talking to them, and it’s very difficult because it’s unnatural, but it is a good lesson in flexibility,” said Aspen Somers, a freshman majoring in theatre.
Even during in-person classes, there are regular challenges – such as time management and focus – presented to theatre students. Being online often makes these challenges even more prominent.
“It’s just hard to be focused and feel like you have a connection with your scene partner when you’re staring at them on the computer and you have your dog barking in the background or the vacuum going or something,” Somers said.
With new online logistical challenges, being a theatre major isn’t a walk in the park. Students in SDA still must work hard on a daily basis to be the best version of themselves.
“It’s always a little bit nerve-wracking coming into such a great educational facility where there’s a lot of really talented people. I get imposter syndrome a lot,” Langan said. “It makes you get in your head a little bit more and question your choices and as an actor, which you kind of have to learn to set aside and not think about as much because it’s always going to be back there, but it’s just trying to remember that everybody’s here, everybody’s learning.”
Nonetheless, students in SDA are still having fun and making memories while putting on impressive productions, even over Zoom. 
Nyström recounts her experience working with Impulse Theatre Company, working alongside director Erika Bautista and playwright Michael Warker on a Zoom production of Warker’s one- act play, “Helpline.”
“This past show that we just put on has been super fun. We were able to incorporate everything that we’ve been doing within Zoom and just bringing it all to the table, working together with both the production team as well as the playwright,” Nyström said.
Additionally, USC provides its students with unique learning opportunities to pair with their involvement in the school community.
“We just started rehearsals for ‘White Plague’ two weeks ago. It’s been really interesting to work on because the director is a guest director, so he has a lot of experience outside of just working at USC. It’s really interesting to see how he has all these ideas for the characters you never really think of,” Somers said.
With shows like “Helpline” and “White Plague” having more structure, students are also involved in a diverse set of performance genres and productions. In addition to structured plays, there are also more collaborative opportunities for students such as sketch comedy productions.
“What’s interesting about the sketch comedy production is that we don’t know what roles we have … And I think that’s something that’s kind of cool because we don’t have assigned characters yet, it’s just working collaboratively to figure out what we want to do and what parts we want to do,” Langan said.
With productions, classes and other learning opportunities occasionally presented by individual professors, it is hard not to get excited as a theatre student at USC. Even online, students continue to foster positive learning experiences.
“I think the main thing is that we just keep finding the joy in the little things. It’s going to be difficult because we’re used to rehearsing all the time, and that’s a part of our personality and how we grow, and it feels kind of empty without rehearsals all the time, without acting and you kind of lose the sense of purpose.” Nyström said. “But I think the main thing is just keep going and find the joy in these classes that you have in order to develop.”
