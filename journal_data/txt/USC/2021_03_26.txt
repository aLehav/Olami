Despite numbers improving in recent years, representation of women both in the recording studio and behind the scenes of the music industry is still falling behind. From artists to executives to industry professionals, the business is still overwhelmingly dominated by men, as much of the rest of the entertainment industry today. 
Although celebrities and musicians such as Billie Eilish, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Cardi B often dominate the public discourse surrounding pop culture, it remains clear — despite what others might think — that women play a smaller role year after year in the music industry.
With this in mind, according to the most recent study on inclusion in the recording studio conducted by the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, women are still missing in much of popular music. 
In 2020 alone, the prevalence of women artists across 900 songs stood at a mere 20.2% — down 2.3% from the previous year. Equally shocking, the ratio of men to women producers is 38 to 1. And again, the numbers are low for women who work as songwriters, standing at a mere 12.9% in 2020. These stats represent just a small fraction of the categories where women are missing in the music industry. 
It’s no secret that the gender gap has always been a point of tension among those in the music industry and for major music awards ceremonies alike. The Recording Academy, for example, does not lack allegations of systemic sexism and voting irregularities. 
From 2013 to 2021, 13.4% of Grammy nominees were women and 86.6% were men. Let that sink in. As a woman, seeing these statistics is disappointing but, sadly, unsurprising. 
Since the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards were held just two weeks ago, let’s reflect on where the awards ceremony stands and if the goals of the Recording Academy line up more today with the statements they’ve made regarding representation than they did in the past. 
To start, rewind three years to 2018 when the #GrammySoMale hashtag began trending on social media to call out the problematic ceremony for its lack of gender diversity after only one woman received a major award. 
What’s worse is what Neil Portnow, the Recording Academy President at the time, said after the fact. When asked by Variety about the recent trending hashtag, he responded that women need to “step up,” which, as to be expected, further aggravated the already-fervent social media uproar. 
Frustration from many stemmed from multiple factors but primarily from the fact that women have been “stepping up” for years yet haven’t been recognized in the same way men have. Women continue to be trailblazers, making significant strides in the music business while inspiring a new generation of aspiring women executives and artists and demanding equality while creating ground-breaking sounds. 
As the eclectic Icelandic singer-songwriter and 15-time Grammy nominee, Björk once said, “I want to support young girls who are in their twenties now and tell them, ‘You’re not just imagining things.’ It’s tough. Everything that a guy says once, you have to say five times.”
Women are tired of not being taken seriously, and Björk is just one of many successful artists who have experienced and observed sexism in the music industry. 
Since the #GrammySoMale debacle, the academy has begun pushing diversity and inclusion efforts. Though this year’s Grammys looked a little different from most, multiple women made history and broke grounds. 
Beyoncé became the most-awarded woman in Grammy history, bringing in her 28th win for best R&B performance for “Black Parade.” Taylor Swift became the first female artist to win Album Of The Year on three separate occasions. Fiona Apple won her first award in the last 24 years despite being nominated several times in previous years. The list continues. 
Thus, as Women’s History Month comes to a close, let’s take a moment to celebrate the many achievements of women in the music industry, both now and in honor of those who came before. 
“Like a Prayer” singer Madonna changed the game in the ’80s, pushing the envelope with her continuous reinvention of self and music messages, paving the way for many female artists to do the same. 
Ella Fitzgerald broke through many barriers in the ’60s as a woman of color during the civil rights movement. She also went on to become the first woman to receive multiple Grammy awards.
Infamous “R-E-S-P-E-C-T” soul singer Aretha Franklin was the first woman out of the now 44 to be inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
Increasing the representation of women in the music industry isn’t about overrunning the men in the business; it’s about balancing out the current disparity and creating equal opportunities for both men and women.
There’s this old saying that came to my mind while writing this week’s column: “practice what you preach.” If labels, awards ceremonies, companies and different divisions of the music business preach statements of inclusion, diversity and equality then they must also hold themselves accountable for their words and make strides to improve their actions. 
I hope to one day see the business become a more inclusive and diverse environment. 
The music industry still has a long way to go and though we still await change, there will come a day.

Thirty-nine students tested positive for the coronavirus between March 14 and March 20, breaking a two-month trend of decline, according to the USC COVID-19 Dashboard. The majority of cases are associated with students travelling by air internationally to Mexico or across state lines to Florida to popular vacation destinations, which have a substantial chance of infection, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media briefing Thursday. 
“You’re not just traveling somewhere and staying there; you’re traveling somewhere for a few days and then traveling back,” Van Orman said. “Don’t get in a plane and fly to Mexico, take a car trip with three or four people you live with and stay physically distanced.”
USC’s ability to discipline students violating public health guidelines is limited because they’re in contact with multiple people and rarely disclose their activities, Van Orman said. 
“We are not able to enforce quarantine because, unfortunately, these are people that are living off campus, in private apartments,” Van Orman said. “We really have to rely on people to understand the rules and understand why they’re there.”
Van Orman said that Student Health is currently monitoring the situation, due to the presence of more contagious strains, such as the U.K. and New York variants. 
“[The variant] had been in a group of students who hadn’t been infected before, so they’re vulnerable,” Van Orman said “I think we’re going to continue to see outbreaks with people violating the rules.”
Regardless, Van Orman said students are welcome to come back to campus if they comply with the Trojan Check and follow county public health guidelines of quarantining ten days after travel, social distancing, wearing a mask and hand sanitizing. 
“We really want people on campus and that’s part of why we really want to advise people about the issues around travel,” Van Orman said. “We want things to get back to normal.”
In a Universitywide email Tuesday, Provost Charles Zukoski detailed plans to further open campus access, such as opening on-campus museums, increasing library access and offering outdoor intramural and club sports. Van Orman said individual schools are also planning to host on-campus activities such as wellness events, open office hours, Makerspaces where School of Architecture students can utilize 3D printers and practice rooms for Thornton School of Music students.
“A lot of it is focused on academic opportunities for students to come in,” Van Orman said. “It really depends on the school but there’s a whole range of things that are really focused right now on letting students get two things: one, to get back to facilities that they haven’t had access to, and then, two, to allow people to gather in small groups to have discussions and study periods.” 
USC will hold an in-person commencement ceremony for the classes of both 2020 and 2021 from May 14 to May 25 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, but Van Orman said plans could change as late as May 13— USC activities are dependent on county guidelines. LA County entered the red tier March 15, allowing certain indoor venues like gyms, libraries and stadiums to reopen under reduced capacity. 
The commencement will be held over the course of two weeks to avoid over population capacity limits recommended by the county, Van Orman said. Physical contact will be limited and seating will be assigned and separated by household to avoid transmission.
“Chances are, there’s going to be someone with [coronavirus] there,” Van Orman said. “We want to create a situation where you can go and attend and sit six feet away from someone with [coronavirus] and not get it … It’s a little sad, but we want to avoid things that cause people to come into close contact.”
To those who plan to attend graduation, Van Orman recommends remaining in isolation before and after the event. 
“If people are choosing to come for graduation, be really cautious,” Van Orman said. “Don’t mingle, don’t go out. Stay within your household units when you’re in your commencement location, and then, when you go back, quarantine for 10 days.”

Andrew Pham — or yours, andrew, as you might know him — is writing love letters through his music. 
Pham, a junior majoring in popular music performance, started playing guitar when he was 12 years old, but didn’t start writing songs until he was about 18. Despite writing songs for four years, it wasn’t until last year that he put a team together to record all of the songs he’d written.
Recently, he released songs “Tell Me” and “DYGWYW?” (an acronym for “did you get what you wanted”) on Nov. 13, 2020 and Feb. 12, 2021, respectively.
“In the past, I’d write for projects I was in or write just to write and not really do anything with it,” Pham said. “Last year changed that, and I felt inspired to explore that part of myself. I truly only wanted to see if I could record a song and have it sound good. I didn’t really come into it with aspirations; I just wanted to see how it would turn out.” 
Similarly, while he was growing up, Pham didn’t think of pursuing music until he saw his cousin playing a ukulele at a family Christmas party in the fifth grade. He describes that instance as his first introduction to music and ended up begging his parents for a ukulele soon after. Eventually, they gave in and he was hooked.
“Once I learned ukulele, I just wanted to know more,” Pham said. “So I bought a guitar, took lessons… went to electric guitar and then bass and then just made this little world of music.”
He started practicing up to six hours a day, learning “the songs [he’d] always wanted to.” Then, he attended an arts high school, further cultivating his love of music, before going to USC. Now, he’s making his own music.
“Tell Me,” which is an upbeat but “indie pop” song, was promoted with nostalgia-tinged videos of utility poles, a crisp picture of “tell me” inscribed candy hearts and of a stop sign. It immerses listeners into feelings of longing. Also, it details the conversations you often have in your head when — despite there being undeniable, romantic feelings lingering in the air — you’re wishing your crush would confess their feelings for you, so you don’t have to. 
The song also utilized samples of a phone ringing and a car door closing, further immersing listeners into Pham’s specific recollection. 
“A lot of the time spent with the person [who the song is about] happened in cars, so it was just me painting a picture of the conversations in the cars,” Pham said.
On the other hand, “DYGWYW?,” which was teased with more faded, nostalgic videos and a picture of a dog with a “DYGWYW?” bone-shaped collar tag, is a more somber song about trying to find peace and overcome the feeling of being used by someone. 
Pham co-wrote both “sentimental funk” songs — “it’s groovy, but it’s heartfelt,” Pham said — with his friend, musician Brett Kramer. While they’re both very much rooted in Pham’s real life experiences, he describes his writing process very abstractly. 
“It’s funny because sometimes I feel like I’m thinking about my life as the words are coming out,” Pham said. “I haven’t put too much thought into it, but the lyrics are truly just [telling a story] of an anecdote in time; just me painting a picture of the world.”
Pham was inspired by musical artists like Phoebe Bridgers, Astronauts, etc. and Teri Moïse and says that with “Tell Me,” he wanted to make the song story-centric and have a proper narrative threaded through the song’s lyrics. However, there was a lot of thought that went into the visuals, too.
David Linkletter, who did the cover art for “Tell Me,” said that there was a long brainstorming process when he and Pham worked together to create art for yours, andrew. He talks about how they put together mood boards and sent ideas and albums they liked back and forth for weeks. Then, they were able to narrow down the final things they wanted to include in Pham’s project.
“It was very stream of consciousness,” Linkletter said. “It wasn’t a very organized process by any means, but what helped it come together was that we’re both creative-minded and that there’s a lot of crossover between fim and music, visuals and sound, so it was easy.”
With “DYGWYW?,” Pham said that it was more about working with a video team to make sure that the song and its accompanying visuals properly embodied the feelings he wanted to convey.
“The director wanted to capture the feeling of overcoming or…. of moving on,” Pham said. “It’s just recognizing that the situation you were in didn’t serve you, and you’re gonna move past it.”
Sarah Hinesley, who is also a junior majoring in popular music performance, helped with the background vocals, synth and piano in “DYGWYW?” and praised not just the work environment that Pham and his collaborators were able to create, but their strong relationship as well.  
“Getting to see [Pham’s] process unfold from the demo stage to the final product really taught me a lot,” Hinesley said. “His relationship with the producers Jonny and Brett is really special, and I could see that from the minute I walked in. I think being able to go into the studio with an open mind and playing off of each other’s ideas is really important, and it was truly such a creative environment with caring individuals.”
Though the creativity and care that was delivered through this project is evident, Pham credits the project’s inspiration and expansion of his “little world of music” to the people he has around him.
“The people I collaborate with in my own music has been inspiring,” Pham said. “Every time we work together, we always feel like we either learn something about each other or about the musical world we’re creating, and it’s exciting to see that unfold and become more nuanced and complex.”
Despite the pandemic and the fact that methods of contacting or staying in touch with each other has been limited, Pham has still found a way to create art and fulfillment through connecting with people in whatever ways he can.
“Getting to know people more has been inspiring,” Pham said. “In this time, you can’t really experience life, but you can still experience people through conversation. All it truly takes is a phone call.”
Or a letter.
Pham’s songs “Tell Me” and “DYGWYW?” are available on Spotify. His EP is projected to come out sometime before the end of the year.

Putting down a copy of Jane Austen’s “Sense and Sensibility,” mom Margarette (Emmanuelle Bercot) graciously accepts an invitation to meet her daughter Jeanne’s (Noémie Merlant) new beau. 
Nearing her late twenties, Jeanne, described by producer Anais Bertrand as “crazy, very sexy, and a bit autistic,” had previously shown her affection for the trinkets she constructed into theme park attractions by hand in her room. Now working a job in the theme park she frequented as a child, Jeanne’s affection for the rides transforms into a new sense of feeling.
“Jumbo,” an early directorial attempt by Zoé Wittock, begs you to visualize the silky smooth feeling of cold metal — the low hum of a machine whirring to life. Jeanne feels it so rapturously in the theme park that the new flame she invites her mom to meet returns that warmth with an assortment of red lights.
The love affair begins as Jeanne hand-cleans the new ride in the park, wiping each expanse of metal and plastic that responds back with a flash of light, a spin of seats. She feels something for this machine, who she names Jumbo because it fits better than its given branding — “it’s not about sex, it’s something else.”
The something comes in a scene of blinding white, where Jeanne is enveloped by the true essence of Jumbo, its love (and its oil). Her response is sexual gratification, and the openness Jeanne exudes in sharing this new relationship with her mother is immediately stifled.
The mother-daughter relationship never comes to any meaningful heartfeltness, with Margarette’s hypersexualized behavior and uncensored conversations with her daughter playing for the occasional laugh (if you can manage it). When Jeanne tells her mother about her feelings for Jumbo, the descent into outright cruelty comes at every instance of confused honesty from Jeanne, who’s trying to make sense of sexuality but needs no explanation of its partner in sensuality. Suppose Bertrand or Wittock had been any more careful in the construction of Jeanne’s character, there could have been something to glean about unconditional support in a parent-child relationship or healthy conceptions of love and sex.
Merlant does what she can with that blank slate, bringing the light touches and whispers of love back from “Portrait of a Lady on Fire,” all while her emotional and literal nakedness is left to the will of the camera and the gaze of her mother and the men that impose what the “right” expressions of sexuality are.
The likening of an amusement park ride to a lover rather than a giant vibrator is not all drama, though. The French openness of sexuality meets a Jean-Pierre Jeunet weirdness that another narrative just can’t create (which, apparent in this case, is based on a true one). The hints of comedy are too brief to forget the overwhelming feeling of escapism that the film invokes and then unknowingly projects onto you, and you’re left in a void of feeling — the exact opposite of this film’s foundation.

Though exacerbated by the pandemic, food insecurity has always been an issue in the United States. According to NPR, approximately 13.7 million households experienced food insecurity at some point during 2019. Increasing access to food was especially important for USC alumna Ashton Tu since her grandfather, a refugee from China, accredited a nearby church’s food pantry as a lifeline during difficult times. It gave him hope for the future.
However, most nonprofit organizations formed in response to the issue of food insecurity were centered around reducing food waste instead of increasing food distribution. To combat this growing problem, Tu, Camille Grandjean, Michel Faliski, Jessica Au, Sahil Kothari and Tatiana Vaz founded Good2Go, a nonprofit that utilizes volunteer drivers to bridge the gap between food pantries and food-insecure individuals. 
Launched in earlyFebruary, Good2Go connects volunteer drivers, who sign up through Google Forms on the organization’s Instagram page, with individuals experiencing food insecurity and populations at risk for the coronavirus who need help receiving food. Currently, Good2Go partners with three food pantries: Community in Schools Los Angeles, Family Health Care Resources and Salvation Army Los Angeles. 
“Good2Go is important [because] we know that there are food pantries, people that are food insecure know there are food pantries. It’s not a lack of food available necessarily; it’s more of a lack of accessibility,” said Grandjean, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering. “There were hour-long lines just to get food, so if you have other things or you can’t stand outside for whatever reason for that long, you couldn’t get food by the nature of like, how it was going on logistically.” 
The group met in a two-semester civil engineering course, “Innovation in Engineering and Design for Global Crises,” taught by professors Brad Cracchiola, David Gerber and Daniel Druhora, which encourages innovation of products, services and technologies with a humanistic approach in response to human needs affected by global crises. The group spent their first semester researching problems worsened or created by the coronavirus and grew more passionate as they learned more about the severity of food insecurity.
“You take this class as far as you want, and we really sat down and decided as a team that we wanted to pursue this, and it wasn’t just a class project for us,” Grandjean said. 
After speaking with local food pantries and organizations, Faliski, a senior majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, noticed a three-fold problem between pantries, food insecure individuals and volunteering opportunities. 
Following these interviews, Good2Go began forging partnerships with local food pantries and organizations, which gave them access to the home information and dietary restrictions of each individual signed up at the pantry. Using this information, Good2Go created a system where volunteers could pick up specially constructed bags of food and deliver them to recipients in need. 
Tu said that the class didn’t force them to pursue anything, but discovering a problem that seriously needed a solution inspired them to keep working until their official launch. 
“This is pretty cheesy, but I was talking to one of our professors, and he was saying that this whole class is meant to launch rockets,” Tu said. “Essentially, it’s more like an incubator, and from there, they really want us to take our ideas, run with it and go, [and the professors] provide feedback every single week, so it helps us iterate on our process.” 
In mid March, Good2Go reached the milestone of over 1,000 deliveries, which the team attributed to their professors’ encouragement in helping them improve their organization as a whole. Tu said that when the group’s goal was to complete one delivery in the next month, their professors pushed them to complete it in the next week, which drove the organization’s rapid progress. 
“I received a message from Brad [Cracchiola] last week… he was like, ‘I’m personally so inspired by your team and the progress you’ve made,’” Faliski said. “The reason they’re such great professors in my eyes is because they’re super excited for your highs, and they’re there to celebrate, but they push you to the next step, immediately.” 
Providing USC students with the opportunity to volunteer safely, in a time when volunteering has decreased as a result of health precautions, was the ultimate solution to food pantries’ need for resources, Grandjean said. Tu worked closely with CIS Los Angeles, a mentorship program that initially focused on helping Los Angeles children graduate from high school but shifted to care for low-income family needs on a daily basis—including providing food,and noticed food pantries were struggling to continue because of the lack of volunteers. 
“Food is an important part of helping a child develop and a child’s growth,” Tu said. “So making deliveries is not necessarily just about food insecurity, it’s also about the pantries’ need, and how they need volunteers constantly, to be able to get the food out there.” 
However, because Good2Go depends on consistent volunteering, engaging volunteers to join is a long-term challenge for the team since maintaining high volunteer numbers would allow them to partner with more food pantries and  deliver to more people, Grandjean said. Currently, deliveries are only made on Thursdays and Fridays to Good2Go’s three food pantry partners. Good2Go hopes to eventually partner with recurring corporate volunteer networks or church groups to make more deliveries possible. 
“Anytime someone does a delivery they love it, and most of the time, people come back to do deliveries, but just the first step of getting people interested or getting people engaged is challenging now, and I don’t think that will be less challenging,” Grandjean said. 
To streamline the volunteering process, Good2Go sends an email and a morning text reminder to their volunteers, including photos that show directions to the food pantry, addresses of the apartment buildings or houses to be delivered to and greetings in different languages for food recipients who do not speak English. 
Hannah Cruz, a senior majoring in accounting, said she enjoyed volunteering with Good2Go because of how much of a difference can be made with a short time commitment, since five to 25 deliveries at an apartment complex can be made in an hour and a half. Cruz said that Good2Go made volunteering an “effortless” experience because of how much helpful information they provided.
“The first woman I delivered to didn’t speak any English, so at first I was panicked because I was like, ‘I don’t know Spanish,’” Cruz said. “Then, I remembered that Good2Go sent me an information sheet of things to say in Spanish, and it was perfect and made the situation so much easier. She knew exactly what I was there for and what I was doing and she got her food.” 
Though the experience is contactless to maintain safety, delivering food is still rewarding to Cruz.
“It’s definitely kind of like that instant gratification that so many of us are looking for in today’s society,” Cruz said. “You get to perform the action and instantly see the benefits that it’s providing. So it’s nice to know that this delivery that was handcrafted by these great organizations are then being handed over to this person’s door, and this might be the only delivery they get for the week … makes you think about things on a much deeper level.” 
Every time Faliski makes deliveries from Family Healthcare Resources on Fridays, she said seeing the people she’s bringing food to makes the experience much more memorable. 
“When I go to that specific location on Friday, there’s like four or five people that always are just like outside their door waiting for delivery, and the smile on their face and the gratitude that they have for us helping them get the food to their door… just reminds you every week how important what we’re doing is to people,” Faliski said. “The fact that we can help them spread that [feeling] to other [volunteers] is really special for sure.”

Following 9/11, researchers at USC realized that there was a lack of resources devoted to the study of terrorism, so professors were recruited to form an independent research group at the university to address the issue of terrorism. However, as more people got involved, the topics of research at the program expanded to include other problems as well, such as natural disasters and technological accidents. 
Now, the independent research center, dedicated to studying terrorism across various disciplines including economics  and engineering, received a $1 million grant from the United States Department of Defense to conduct a study on terrorism in post-conflict zones early this February. 
The purpose of the grant, also known as the Minerva Grant, is to fund abstract analyses that do not have immediate policy applications but can be used to inform future decision-making processes by the government. 
According to CREATE Director Adam Rose, who is also the lead principal investigator on the Minerva Grant Project, much of the infrastructure in post conflict zones, such as Iraq or Afghanistan, has been damaged from conflict in the area. To rebuild, countries need to have reliable transportation systems to allow for movement of people and goods, which CREATE plans to research through the Minerva Research Initiative. 
“What our thinking is, is for these failed states to get back on their feet, they need to have a viable and sustainable transportation logistics system to move goods and people in a lot of these places,” Rose said. “We hope to develop a strong conceptual model that will help us analyze these situations and help us evaluate them.”
To qualify for the grant, Rose put together a research team composed of leaders in their fields from major universities — including USC, Cornell University, Pennsylvania State University, University of Wisconsin and George Mason University — to draft a proposal focused on a plan to examine regions as a whole with an emphasis on logistic systems and spatial dimension in particular. 
CREATE’s status as an independent research group was also important to ensure the project would contain objective, non-ideological information that can be used for future decision making, Rose said.
According to Rose, the Department of Defense hopes this grant will result in research that can ultimately be used to stabilize post-conflict zones by reducing violence and thus lessening breeding grounds for terrorist organizations. 
Since its founding, CREATE has also expanded to include the study of a wide variety of societal issues beyond terrorism, ranging from natural disasters to technological accidents such as nuclear power and collapsed infrastructure. 
In general, CREATE assesses the probability that an attack or threat will occur and uses this information in an attempt to counter them upfront to lessen the likelihood that they will occur and the potential harm they will cause, specifically to property and business operations, Rose said. They do so by researching terrorist motivations, targeting investments in conflict zones, and studying the economic impacts of terrorism. 
“We can’t protect against every threat. Some are going to get through,”Rose said. “[The question is] how do we bounce back efficiently and rapidly.” 
In order to carry out these studies, CREATE often receives funding from a variety of institutions, including the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Science Foundation and the World Bank, each of which have incredible stakes in CREATE’s research due to the ways such disasters impact the economy in their aftermath.
The interdisciplinary nature of CREATE is one of its most significant features said Richard John, a psychology professor at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the associate director for research at CREATE
“It [became] apparent pretty quickly that terrorism was more than just a policy problem or an engineering problem. It was also a people problem,” said John. “You couldn’t leave out behavioral science from the equation. You had to account for how people react to extreme events.” 
One behavioral study done by CREATE involved the public reaction to the Orlando nightclub shooting on June 12, 2016. In the study, researchers used standard text dictionaries to classify whether tweets related to the shooting exhibited anger or fear while simultaneously using a geospatial identifier to code where the tweet came from and the distance from Orlando.
“We found that anger was actually quite a bit greater the further you were away from Orlando, and we found that fear dissipated quite rapidly near Orlando but less rapidly at places further from Orlando,” John said. 
These studies are often done with the help of both USC professors and graduate students said Rose.  Juan Machado, a recent graduate from the Price School of Public Policy, was one of these researchers. 
Machado first became involved with CREATE while taking a class with Rose, who asked if Machado would join the research team. Since then, they have worked together on a project to estimate the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the United States economy — specifically the effects of shutdowns and stimulus bills on GDP. 
Despite finding a job immediately after graduation last May, Machado decided to stay involved with the center to participate in their study of the economic impacts of the coronavirus, a study which was also funded by the federal government. 
“[At] the center, a lot of our work revolves around cost-benefit analysis and a method called computer general equilibrium models, which are used to estimate the economic impact of different policies,” Machado said. “At Price, it was great to learn about these things in the classroom, but having the first hand experience of how it is applied and putting it together and how it is used by policymakers has been very valuable, it gave me a direct experience.” 
According to Machado, it is projects like these that are what make CREATE an important resource and ultimately encouraged him to continue his research.
“I felt this was of great importance to the public interest, so I wanted to stay involved with the Center,” Machado said. “The field of developmental economics is super important, but I think the contributions of infrastructure development are well researched but not so much in post-conflict zones, so I think this project will be a very important contribution to the literature on the subject.”

As another week of March comes to a close, men’s basketball is on the brink of something truly special at the NCAA Tournament. 
Sixth-seeded USC will face familiar Pac-12 foe seventh-seeded Oregon Sunday in the Sweet 16. A win would secure the Trojans’ first Elite Eight appearance since 2001. 
The Trojans are coming off a huge lopsided victory against third-seeded Kansas Jayhawks in the Round of 32. Five players reached double figures for USC, including senior guard Isaiah White and senior forward Chevez Goodwin. It was also a game where freshman forward Evan Mobley, USC’s biggest star, had only had 10 points.
The Jayhawkssuffocated for the entirety of the game, only shooting 29% from the field and outrebounded by 16. They also only had one player reach double figures — senior guard Marcus Garrett, who needed 15 shot attempts to reach 15 points. 
Head coach Andy Enfield highlighted the significance of a win over a college basketball powerhouse like Kansas.
“This game meant a lot to our program and to our fans. USC basketball is on the rise,” said Enfieldin a virtual press conference Monday. “Over the last 80 years, it’s been like a roller coaster — a lot of great players, great coaches [and] great teams — but we’re trying to sustain the success, build a program and sustain the success.”
The complete performance from the Trojans prompts a matchup against the Ducks who are hitting their stride at the right time. Oregon upset No. 2 Iowa in their last game, putting up 95 total points while shooting 44% from the 3-point line.
The Ducks have an outstanding trio of guards such as seniors Chris Duarte and LJ Figueroa and junior Will Richardson. All three men combined for 63 points against Iowa and shot 66% from the field combined.
Couple their fantastic shooting with first-team All-Pac-12 selection senior forward Eugune Omoruyi, and USC faces an explosive offense, including streaky 3-point shooting they’ll have to contain. The Trojans’ length will be tested against Oregon’s quick guards, and the story of the game will probably be how USC’s stingy defense performs against the explosive Ducks offense. 
Enfield had mixed emotions about the meeting with the Pac-12 opponent.
“We have a lot of respect for that team … To play Oregon in the Sweet 16, honestly, I wish we were playing a team from another conference. I’m not sure how we’re meeting them in the Sweet 16,” he said. “They were 14-4 in the league; we were 15-5 this year. I think it’ll be a great college basketball game.” 
In the first and only matchup against the Ducks this season, a 47% shooting performance from 3 carried USC to a 14-point win. However, the game was played over a month ago, and both teams are in very different positions this weekend. 
Oregon proceeded to go on a six-game winning streak, stealing the Pac-12 championship from USC by only one game. 
The matchup with the Ducks prompted a reaction from sophomore forward Isaiah Mobley when asked about the upcoming game. 
“I don’t want to say, necessarily, that they got luck because they are a good team,” he said Monday. “But they stole the Pac-12 championship from us, so I think we match up well, though. We both have chips [on] our shoulders.”A spot in the Elite Eight awaits. Tip-off is Sunday at 6:45 p.m. at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, In.

USC and No. 11 UCLA women’s soccer teams met March 18 in Westwood. After an impressive performance from USC senior forward Tara McKeown, who netted two goals for the Trojans, the game finished in a 2-2 draw. USC will now look ahead to a matchup against conference foe Arizona. 
About halfway through the season, USC sits in the bottom half of the Pac-12 standings. At 3-3-1, the Trojans are No. 8 in a competitive league. USC’s crosstown rival UCLA is sporting an undefeated record in Pac-12 play and is 8-0-1 overall. 
UCLA went up early after senior midfielder Marley Canales converted a penalty kick in the 18th minute. Redshirt senior Kaylie Collins was in goal for the Trojans. 
USC’s first goal of the game came in the 38th minute from McKeown, who converted on a downfield assist from sophomore midfielder Croix Bethune. The remainder of the half was scoreless. 
Both teams were well-defended by strong backfield units, but McKeown evaded defenders on her way to her second goal of the game. The goal — which occurred in the 68th minute of play — came from just inside the box, soaring over UCLA junior goalkeeper Lauren Brzykcy into the upper-left corner of the goal post. 
As the game progressed into its final five minutes of play, it appeared the Trojans were on their way to a big victory over one of the nation’s top teams. However, UCLA freshman forward Reilyn Turner forced the game into overtime with a goal in the 86th minute. 
In the 99th minute, McKeown was awarded a free kick but narrowly missed hitting the crossbar. USC junior forward Penelope Hocking had an opportunity to score off the bounce, but Brzykcy cleared the ball away. 
After a long 110 minutes of play, the game ended in a tie.
“I thought the game went pretty well,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “I thought we should have won the game.”
The tie came after a two-game losing streak for the Trojans. USC was previously shut-out 2-0 in their game against Utah and lost an early 2-0 lead to Colorado, falling 3-2 in overtime. 
“I thought the Utah game, we didn’t play very well,” McAlpine said. “I thought the Colorado game we started to find our fight, bit unfortunate the way it ended.”
Despite the last three games resulting in a 0-2-1 run, McAlpine appears optimistic about USC’s remaining schedule. 
“We’re starting to feel like the group I thought we would have at the beginning of the year,” McAlpine said. 
After three consecutive games on the road, USC will be playing against Arizona at the Coliseum, where they have yet to lose a game.
The Wildcats have had a dominant start to their season, winning their first four games by a total of 13-1 goals against non-Pac-12 opponents. However, in conference play, they have gone 2-3, including losses against UCLA, Oregon and Washington. 
“They are such a disruptive team in their style — it’s like nothing we’ve played so far,” McAlpine said. 
Led in both goals and assists by senior forward Jill Aguilera, the Trojan defense will have to stop Arizona’s aggressive offense to stay in the game. 
“We just have to be alert,” McAlpine said. “We spent a little time just trying to make sure that the players understand that the game may not have the rhythm and flow that the UCLA game had,” McAlpine said. 
On the offensive side, the dynamic duo of McKeown and Hocking will face a stingy Arizona defense that has only allowed 0.89 goals per game. McKeown and Hocking both lead the team in goals scored, with five and four goals, respectively.
The game starts at 12:30 p.m. Friday and can be streamed on the Pac-12 Network.

I was flanked on both sides by two Navy Corpsmen, a third one carrying half my body weight with the harness wrapped around my waist. They were helping me do my daily walk around the 4 North East ward. I was in the hospital for the second time that year and was the sickest, weakest and in the most pain I’d ever been. All my mom could think about was making sure the wheelchair trailing behind me would catch me if I fainted or fell, but all I could think about was how this was the closest I’d been to cute guys in months.
Being a young person with chronic illness is a very isolating experience. In a life often totally consumed with keeping track of meds, managing your pain, staying on top of doctors appointments, procedures and infusions, staying sane and afloat is pretty much Oscar worthy. So how am I supposed to find time to meet people my own age or date?
I was terrified of becoming a Carrie and Big love story — a romance that took 10 years of agonizing back-and-forth and relationship games, only for them to end up together in the end. As a chronically ill person, that literally sounds like my worst nightmare; I don’t have the time or energy to do months of back-and-forth or play games — all that energy goes to keeping this sexy vessel healthy and upright. 
The pandemic was tragic for innumerable reasons, but one upside was that everyone turned to online dating. I’d never considered online dating before because I’m a classic gal who prefers a romantic chance encounter. However, the older I get, the more I realize that’s a movie magic lie, and at this point, I’ve been through hell and back with my health, and I’ve got nothing to lose. 
When going to create my Tinder and Hinge profiles, I immediately hit a brick wall. I was trying to find cute pictures for my profile, but the only pictures on my camera roll from the past two years were either of me in the hospital with bags under my eyes giving a sarcastic thumbs up, or of me looking very scraggly because I hadn’t had the energy to shower for days. The only viable pictures I had were from my sophomore year of college, and it felt wrong to use those because that isn’t the person I am now. Then came the second brick wall: writing my bio.
Catherine. 22. Loves the beach. Lives with debilitating chronic pain and may need to bring ice packs on date. 
No, definitely not that. 
Catherine. 22. Loves dogs. Will need to premedicate for any activity longer than an hour.
Not quite. 
Catherine. 22. No, I don’t care how big a fish you caught or what kind of car you have. Yes, shower sex is an option as long as you’re cool with a shower chair.
Closer?
Catherine. 22. Has tubes coming out of her arm, but don’t worry, they won’t get tangled if we make out. 
Catherine. 22. Doesn’t do drugs — only prescription ketamine for high pain days, and no, I won’t share. 
Catherine. 22. Her body doesn’t work, but it might for you?
I got frustrated pretty quickly with the process. Though after a while, I realized why nothing I wrote felt accurate enough. I don’t even have the words to describe what I’ve been through, so how am I supposed to distill it down for someone I’m meeting for the first time? 
I ended up going on a few (socially distanced or virtual) dates, and they were actually really fun. Sometimes my health came up, sometimes it didn’t. I did my best to let conversation flow naturally and I knew that being honest would not only leave me feeling good about speaking my truth, but sometimes my date could actually relate to some of things I’ve been through with my health, and that always led to us getting to know each other better. 
Finding the words to describe my lived experience has become easier with practice. Ultimately, I realized that dating itself isn’t what scares me (because to be honest, I know I’m an absolute fire date, and I find meeting new people really exciting). 
What scares me is something I think a lot of people living with chronic health conditions fear: compassion fatigue. I had, and still sometimes have, a real fear that letting someone into my world of needles, meds and daily pain will freak them out, or they’ll think it’s “too much.” I had a deep fear that if I’m upfront and truly honest about my lived experience, it might turn a friend or romantic partner off. Although I no longer feel that way, working through that fear took a long time. 
Now, I can confidently say there is no magical formula to navigate the conversation of my health journey with someone I’m interested in romantically. There’s no “10 Steps on How to Love Someone With Chronic Illness.” That’s some Cosmopolitan advertising BS. 
In reality, chronic illness doesn’t mean the end of dating. It means the start of dating in a new way where I am not defined by my health conditions. Yes, they are a huge part of my lived experience, and living with them has taught me so much about life, but I am not Lupus. I am not POTS. I am not IgG2 Sub Class Immune Deficiency. I am not Migraine. I am Catherine — student, singer, dancer, best friend, daughter, columnist, activist, advocate, tutor and so much more — living alongside chronic illness and all the more fabulous because of it. 
Catherine. 22. Bad bitch. 
Yeah, that’s definitely it.
