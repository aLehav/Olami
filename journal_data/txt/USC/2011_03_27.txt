It may only be beginning of spring, but this summer’s Vans Warped Tour is already stealing the attention of die-hard fans.
Pre-sale tickets became available on Saturday and several cities have already sold-out. The discounted, custom designed pre-sale tickets come with early entry, the 2011 VWT compilation CD and the option to buy an exclusive $15 tour shirt.
Kevin Lyman, founder of VWT, knew how to build a vast amount of anticipation for the tour.
Instead of announcing the entire line-up at one time, starting a couple months ago, bands were announced little by little on the official website, about five or seven at a time.
On Saturday, A Day To Remember, The Devil Wears Prada, Asking Alexandria, 3OH!3, Gym Class Heroes, Against Me!, August Burns Red and Attack Attack! were announced as the joining bands for the Teggart main stage.
The other main stage bands include Pepper, Less Than Jake, Jack’s Mannequin, and D.R.U.G.S.
VWT’s list of bands doesn’t end there though. Paramore has recently announced that it will perform on a few select dates.
Go to their Bands page to see the entire up-to-date list. Since some bands won’t be appearing on the entire tour, make sure to click a certain band’s page to see which dates they are scheduled to be on.
For those not able to buy pre-sale tickets, general admission tickets are usually for sale even on the day of the show at the entrance.

After senior tailback Marc Tyler pulled his hamstring during Tuesday’s practice, freshman tailback D.J. Morgan was forced to bow out midway through Saturday’s practice due to what USC coach Lane Kiffin termed “knee tendinitis.”
Time to shine · Junior running back Curtis McNeal could be a potential special teams standout this season, according to USC coach Lane Kiffin. - Daily Trojan file photo 
For a team already decimated by injuries, the decision to pull Morgan out of practice was precautionary, as the coaching staff feared the wet grass might have been hazardous for Morgan, who has been recovering from a torn ACL injury he suffered during his senior year of high school.
These two injuries allowed junior Curtis McNeal and sophomore Dillon Baxter to receive more repetitions at tailback. McNeal noticeably outshined the more celebrated Baxter, at least on this day, breaking off several runs of at least 10 yards, while Baxter was often stopped at the line of scrimmage.
“Both of them have had great attitudes this spring,” Kiffin said. “Curtis, once he was ineligible last season, really hit him. Sometimes guys have to hit rock-bottom before they figure it out. His attitude’s been great comparable to when he got here.”
Although McNeal flashed explosiveness, Kiffin was non-committal when asked if McNeal figured into the tailback competition. Instead, Kiffin foresees McNeal as more of a special teams standout who also must become academically eligible for the upcoming season.

A glaring weakness for the Trojans this past season was their mediocre pass defense. Though two of the positions in the secondary are set with junior free safety T.J. McDonald and sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey returning, the competition to secure both the strong safety spot and the cornerback position opposite Robey are wide-open, with no shortage of candidates.
Freshman cornerback Anthony Brown impressed coaches Saturday with an interception return for a touchdown and deflections.
“He’s really worked extremely hard since the day that he got here,” Kiffin said. “He’s not a great paper guy. He’s not height-weight-speed ratio, but he made a bunch of plays in high school, and hopefully he can continue to do what he did today.”
Brown said he feels much more comfortable with the USC defensive schemes in the second year of his career, but still struggles with breaking to the ball quickly enough on occasion.

Freshman Curtis Washington sat patiently at Friday’s press conference in the Galen Center, waiting for junior forward Nikola Vucevic to announce if he would return for his senior season.
“We would ask [Vucevic] and he would never tell us,” Washington said.
Big shoes to fill · With Vucevic declaring for the NBA draft, USC will need to replace its leading scorer and rebounder from this season. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Vucevic’s announcement that he will declare for the NBA draft and sign with an agent, forfeiting his final season of collegiate eligibility, means Washington’s minutes for next season will significantly increase.
“Of course I always want to work hard, but it makes me work that much harder knowing that I will have a larger role,” Washington said. “It is going to be difficult to fill Nikola’s role, so we are going to have to work hard.”
With Vucevic (34.9 minutes per game) and senior forward Alex Stepheson (32.9 minutes per game) departing, USC will rely heavily on an inexperienced frontcourt next season. The Trojans’ post rotation will include transfers James Blasczyk, DeWayne Dedmon and Aaron Fuller, in addition to Washington, who did not score last season.
“Curtis is a lot like me when I was a freshman,” Vucevic said. “He is a young guy who works really hard every day. He is one of the guys who works the hardest on the team.”
USC coach Kevin O’Neill said he plans to recruit one or possibly two new players.
“We are not going to take anybody that cannot come and help immediately, because that is just wasting a scholarship,” O’Neill said. “If we can find another big, we would be interested, and if we found the right wing player, we might be interested in both, but we are not going to rush into taking somebody for the sake of it.”
Only two of USC’s top seven scorers from last season, guards Jio Fontan and Maurice Jones, are expected to return next season.
“When you lose a guy like [Vucevic], obviously it is going to be a blow to you,” O’Neill said. “It is our job with the guys coming in, and whoever else we end up signing in the late period, to make sure that we have a team that can be competitive in the Pac-10 and get into the postseason.”
After deciding to declare for the NBA draft, Vucevic signed with agent Rade Filipovich of BDA Sports Management.
“It was a tough decision,” Vucevic said. “I thought that if I came back we could have done a lot of good stuff, but at the same time, I wanted to take the next step in my life.”
Had Vucevic not signed with an agent, he would have had until May 8 to withdraw his name and return to college for his senior season.
“I feel like if you do something, you have to go into it 100 percent,” Vucevic said. “It is a lot easier when you have somebody who can take care of the scheduling part.”
Vucevic said he plans to continue taking classes this semester while preparing for the NBA draft, and to take summer school so that he can eventually graduate.
This past season, the 6-foot-10 Vucevic averaged 17.1 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, and was named to the All-Pac-10 First Team. He had a double-double in his final eight regular season Pac-10 games.
Vucevic was the leading scorer and rebounder for the Trojans, who lost to VCU in the first round of the NCAA tournament.
“Nikola’s great advantage is that he is going to be able to guard [NBA power forwards and centers], which very few people can do,” O’Neill said.

The USC women’s basketball team is headed to the Final Four of the Women’s National Invitation Tournament.
Junior guard Ashley Corral scored a career-high 32 points off the bench for the Women of Troy (23-12) as they scored a season-high 53 points in the second half en route to an 87-70 victory over Colorado on Sunday.
Offensive spark · Junior guard Ashley Corral, pictured here against Arizona State, came off the bench to pour in a career-high 32 points in leading USC to an 87-70 victory over Colorado. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
Corral’s 32 points continued her recent scoring binge. She has scored 75 points in USC’s four WNIT wins and has made 17-of-22 three-point attempts.
“[Corral] provides such a spark to our offense, especially when we’re down,” said freshman forward Cassie Harberts. “She’s been hitting threes left and right.”
USC trailed for most of the first half, but never let the Buffaloes extend their lead to more than five points.
At halftime, Colorado led 36-34, and USC coach Michael Cooper challenged his team to come out and play harder in the second half.
“He told us, ‘Right now, [Colorado] is playing harder than you are, they have more energy, and they seem like they want this more than you do,’” Corral said. “We knew that wasn’t true.”
The start of the second half didn’t immediately go as USC wished, as Colorado senior forward Brittany Spears made a three-pointer to give the Buffs their biggest lead of the game.
But then the Women of Troy made their move. USC went on a 10-1 scoring run that put it ahead for good.
“We had to come out and get stops, and hit our jumpers,” Corral said.
After two made free throws by Colorado, USC went on yet another scoring binge, this time a 16-4 streak that put the Women of Troy up 60-46.
Colorado would close the deficit to 69-62 with 3:47 left, after Spears was fouled on a three-point attempt, then made all three free throws to cap a 7-0 run for the Buffs.
But Corral made one of her seven three-pointers on USC’s next possession, extending the lead to double digits and putting the game out of reach.
The Women of Troy made four more three-pointers than the Buffaloes, despite having only half as many attempts from beyond the arc.
USC made 76.9 percent of its three-point attempts, while Colorado only made six of its 26 three-point shots for a 23.1 percent success rate.
Just as they outscored their opponents from the perimeter, the Women of Troy also dominated down low.
Even though Spears scored 36 points for Colorado, most of her points were from either beyond the arc or at the free-throw line. USC also outrebounded Colorado 46-26.
“It’s always a point of ours to outrebound [our opponents],” Harberts said. “Even though Spears had 36 [points], [Corral] neutralized her, so it was fine.”
Corral was one of four USC players with double-digit scoring — junior guard Jacki Gemelos had 20 points, while Harberts and senior center Kari LaPlante both chipped in 10.
In the Final Four of the WNIT for the first time, USC will play at Illinois State (24-10) Wednesday at 5 p.m.
also no basketball band support
It is a real shame that USC did not bid to hold the game here at the Galen Ctr., and worse no broadcast of the game either TV or radio for the fans and supporters of the team to my knowledge.

Although the earthquake was about 200 miles from where Andrew Ream, a junior majoring in psychology and East Asian languages and cultures, was studying, he still felt the tremors at the Tokyo International University where he was studying abroad.
Hosts · Andrew Ream (center, bottom) shares a last meal with his host mom’s friends during his short stay in Kawagoe. He left March 18.
“We were in the middle of our Japanese Society class, during one of the break periods,” Ream said. “When the shaking began, many of us didn’t think it was that serious; the shaking started out weak and many of the students were from areas that experience small scales earthquakes on a regular basis.”
Ream and his classmates soon found this particular earthquake was not like the small-scale earthquakes that frequently affect Japan.
“The shaking grew more intense and our coordinator came out of his office and told everyone to get under the tables,” Ream said. “We did, and there was some screaming, but no one panicked and everyone stayed put.”
Ream noticed the native Japanese citizens could sense something had gone wrong, while the study abroad students didn’t quite understand the gravity of the situation.
“The [Japanese students and teachers] were huddled around in circles, trying to comfort each other; one student was crying and there was tangible fear in the air,” Ream said. “As foreign students, we didn’t fully grasp the severity of the situation, but the native students understood the consequences of an earthquake that strong.”
The 9.0-magnitude quake was about 200 miles away from Tokyo and about 80 miles away from Sendai, Japan.
Eight out of the 17 USC students studying in Japan this semester have already returned to the United States. The others were on breaks in different countries and have not decided on a course of action, according to Michael L. Jackson, vice president of Student Affairs.
Ream was studying at Tokyo International University in Kawagoe, which is to the northwest of Tokyo during the earthquake, for 16 days. Matt Lindley, the TIU abroad program coordinator, informed the students a bus from TIU would be taking them to the airport Friday, March 18, seven days after the earthquake occurred.
Ream was in a store equivalent to a Best Buy when he discovered the shocking news that he was going to have to return to the United States.
“I saw an iPad on display and started fiddling with it, toying with apps, checking my email,” Ream said. “I read that I had to leave by the end of the week.”
Ream said he was disappointed to leave because he was just getting used to his environment and had developed a bond with his host family.
“I felt like I was about to throw up … I was just getting used to everything, I loved my host family to pieces, I was really getting into my classes. There was no way I would have to up and leave all that behind so soon,” Ream said. “I looked out the bus window and watched Kawagoe move past me while I just sat and watched … I just had to watch it all speed past through a pane of glass.”
Ream spoke to his host family, who also shared his sadness that he would have to leave so soon. Ream, reminded himself that he’d be able to come back during the fall semester to continue his studies.
“This realization set my cognitive gears in motion and I started to look at things in a different light,” he said.
Despite the catastrophe, Ream had no idea his time in Japan was going to end so abruptly.
Ream’s graduation date will be pushed back because he originally wanted to study in Japan for a full year, but needed to be in the United States for his last fall semester.

With recent uprisings in Egypt and Libya and the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, USC is facing dilemmas regarding students and offices abroad. Two USC students who were studying in Egypt this semester have come home, and eight out of the 17 students in Japan have returned to the United States, while the others are currently on break in different countries and have not yet decided what to do about their studies abroad, according to Michael Jackson, vice president of student affairs.
The USC administration cannot force these students to return to the United States, because it is each individual’s decision.
“I would encourage people to come home,” Jackson said. “But people are in different stages of their educational career. Each student with his or her family has to make the best decision in the long-run.”
Although the university cannot force students to leave, it is still taking preventative measures to ensure student safety. Certain USC activities in Japan have been cancelled, such as this summer’s Global Fellows Internship Program, according to Fumiyo Stark, director of the USC Japan office.
USC is continuing to monitor the situation in Japan, assisting other universities abroad as best it can.
“I don’t know what the situation is going to be with the nuclear plant and some of the other issues,” said Ken McGillivray, vice provost of global initiatives. “We’re in constant touch to determine whether or not there are things we can do to assist institutions.”
If Japan continues to have problems which threaten to students’ safety and health, the USC offices will restrict students from studying abroad in the area, Jackson said.
This does not, however, mean, USC is terminating its programs in these affected areas.
“It’s a global university, we’re not withdrawing from the world,” Jackson said. “Sometimes we have to be more cautious about where we send people.”
At the moment, the university is interested in reassuring students about safety while abroad.
“The key is that we’re organized so that if something happens, we can reach out and help them,” Jackson said.
The record-keeping begins before students leave campus for their studies abroad. USC has a well-developed database that displays which students are going abroad, to what countries with what programs they’re joining and an emergency contact for the university, according to Jackson.
“We don’t have offices in every country, the key is that students are in really good programs that are supervised by professionals who have lots of experience who can work with us to get students out of harm’s way if crises occur,” Jackson said.
USC does have offices in locations of strategic importance, however.
“[These offices] allow us to be much quicker in terms of reacting to particular situations, good and bad,” McGillivray said.
For instance, USC maintains a wide presence in Asia, having one or two overseas offices in most Asian countries, according to Saori Katada, associate professor of international relations.
“[They] can operate as the key agent in getting communication between students and USC,” Katada said.

Leaders of the Interfraternity Council and Panhellenic Council will meet this week to discuss a course of action in response to photos posted online Saturday night that show two people, one of whom is a member of USC’s Kappa Sigma fraternity, appearing to engage in sexual activities on the roof of Waite Phillips Hall.
Ayushi Gummadi, president of PHC, said PHC and IFC will meet with presidents of all the fraternities and sororities tonight to discuss the viral photos.
“IFC and PHC have called a presidents’ meeting to discuss the viral spread of photos through social media this weekend,” Gummadi wrote. “We plan to look into this situation and will come up with a course of action.”
Zach Timm, president of USC’s Kappa Sigma, released a statement Sunday confirming the male in the photos was a member of Kappa Sigma.
“While the actions that were taken did involve a member of our chapter we, in no way, support this kind of behavior, nor do we promote any other such actions,” Timm wrote in an email. “The member in question has been suspended from Kappa Sigma for conduct unbecoming of a Kappa Sigma and a gentleman until a more detailed investigation can be conducted.”
The photos, which have spread virally around the university, have linked the female to USC’s Delta Gamma sorority because of the Anchor Splash philanthropy that occurred during the afternoon on Saturday, but Lauren Sekula, advisory team chairman of USC’s Delta Gamma, said there is no connection between the two events.
“There is absolutely no relationship between these circumstances and our women or our event, Anchor Splash, which benefits sight prevention and the visually impaired,” Sekula said.
Give both the guy and the gal high fives for their daring stunt… then book them for lewd behavior… fine them $50… then let them go
I hope the viral effect does not include HIV.
How many people were actually “scarred” by that event? God-forbid you see pictures of naked people on the interweb! Give it a break, it’s stupid but funny. Who the hell really cares. Those two need a slap upside the head and a round of shots.
Honestly, if I were paying for the education of my son/daughter at USC and they did some shit like this they had better hope there was someone in between me and them to keep me from kicking their ass.
Just sayin’ :)
Yeah, the girl goes to UCLA. Too bad we now have to find another reason to make fun of DGs.

^Somebody didn’t get a bid……
If politicians did this, maybe we wouldn’t be going to war.
Hi everybody from Italy.
In Italy we used to such facts. We created “Bunga Bunga”
oooo yess
Three cheers and medals all around.
Thanks to the camera people.
An old old guy.
The messages on the board are so funny…The US is having a meltdown over a couple having al fresco sex…get over it or even better try it…
“There is absolutely no relationship between these circumstances and our women or our event, Anchor Splash, which benefits sight prevention and the visually impaired”
Seems to me the lassie was doing her part to lend a helping hand, so that the poor boy wouldn’t find himself alone, performing inappropriate actions upon himself – he might go blind!
And while we’re on the subject, I’m sure he made quite a splash with his anchor.
Sounds like an average night at any university in America.
Why is this the concern of the IFC or the PHC ? Or the University for that matter ? Two people had sex, that’s not a crime last time I checked. Sure, conduct unbecoming, but we’re not in the Marines here people. Time to loosen the chastity belts a little and while we’re at it mind your own damn business.
I threw it up in Facebook and the response has been overwhelmingly positive. Well played by the K.S. guys, obviously a strong bid there. 
Don’t plan on any understanding from Mr. Ayushi Gummad. That name has dorky virgin written all over it. Whoa, stop the press, it’s Miss Ayushi Gummad and she’s sorta cute. 
Come on Ayushi, cut a brother some slack and I’ll see if I can get him to take you to an invite. Gotta admit, the kids ripped, and from the size of the black box covering his member he’s packin heat !
Kappa Sig Bro,
We know she’s DTF down so why haven’t you sent the house a gullet report?! How’s the grip, etc???
Sincerely,
Other Kappa Sig Bros
seems like usc frat / sorority kids are not doing much to improve usc’s reputation.
You mean aside from over achieving in business and giving more money to the school than any other group ? 
Shut your ignorant mouth.
Greek alums are what keeps that school running.
Like a boss
The only thing these two should be ashamed of is getting caught. As an alum, it’s good to see students at USC can still party. Don’t know what the big deal is, if you’ve never experienced something similar to this during your time at ‘SC, shame on you! They should’ve gone to the helicopter pad atop Mudd Hall, at least it’s out of sight with a better view of the city.
doing it on top of SGM would have been a MUCH better move. instead they did it on top of WPH where you stand right at the edge in view of everybody…
You should be giving the guy a high-five, not suspending him.  WTF is up with frats these days?
Can I have sloppy seconds?
Awesome!
FIGHT ON!
Down with the boring old people.
Freedom! Sex! Rock n’ Roll!
It is so sad this happened this happen to another SC girl.  She must have been blacked out or worse.  Thankfully she did not fall.
What makes you think she was blacked out?
Because he was abusing her
How was he “abusing” her exactly?
Pushing her head over the edge and sodomizing her.  She looks terrified.
………wow. You have serious problems.
Bella, you are an idiot. This was an already-dating couple who had consensual vaginal sex in public. No one was being “abused” or “sodomized”. Go see a therapist.
The girl is his girlfriend.  She goes to UCLA.
This is correct.
How do you know she was an ‘SC girl ? From reports we’re getting she goes to UCLA and goes by the handle “UPtight Girl.”
cazzo dici???
Funny thing is — both the guy AND the girl were pretty unattractive. Looks like going at it on the top of WPH was the only way either of them could get action and/or get noticed.
“Anchor Splash, which benefits sight prevention and the visually impaired”  – How does one *benefit* sight *prevention*?  Why are we trying to prevent sight?
DG’s philanthropy is service of site. anchor splash “benefits” sight prevention and the visually impaired because it makes them money
*sight
Still, nope.
It is supposed to be sight preservation.
Leaked agenda from the IFC meeting:
Call to order
Roll call
Last week’s minutes
High fives all around
Give dude a medal
Shots
Closing statements / pass the gavel
9-0
You forgot to mention the PHC meeting going on under the table of the IFC meeting
pretty much how I figured the meeting would go…
All you have to do is show up on the Row on a Thursday night to figure out the “conduct” of Greeks at this university. The only difference between this and any night on the Row is that this is publicized.
“There is absolutely no relationship between these circumstances and our women or our event, Anchor Splash, which benefits sight prevention and the visually impaired” – what an ironic punch line, too bad their philanthropy did not help us all see the girl’s face clearly
How long will IFC investigate this Kappa Sig story?
These clowns are depreciating the value of my degree.
I know! I am so angry about this fact.
How so, because they’re getting laid and you’re not ?
Kid is a champion! Way to go!
The girl isn’t in DG.
Sure she isn’t.
Where did the facts for this article come from? Where did this “reporter” see these “virally leaked” photos? College ACB is far from a reputable website, Daily Trojan.
I saw these photos and have never heard of College ACB before.  The internet is a big place.  Check imgur, where the photos are being hosted.
It is also on reddit.com and a few other sites. It shouldn’t be hard to find them.
No, don’t go to reddit.  That site gives you viruses.
and also plenty of tasty bacon and narwhals.
Upboats all around.
IFC-issued statements, you dolt. Also the photos are everywhere as other posters have said.
Who took the pictures and was that arranged in advance of the roof top encounter? Young lady, what were you thinking? How could such public behavior possibly be to your benefit?  You got both literally and figuratively screwed by Mr. Struts His Stuff.
You hope the UNIVERSITY doesn’t throw these kids under the bus?!?!?! Umm pretty sure they threw themselves under a tractor trailer… Monika Lewinsky has nothing on them.
sorry for partying
yeah. sheesh.
In all seriousness, I hope the university doesn’t throw these kids under the bus. They made a really stupid mistake, but should be given the chance to learn from it. The humiliation they’re in for, thanks to the spread of the photos, should be punishment enough.

USC will begin purchasing eggs from cage-free farms this fall in response to environmental concerns.
“We know it is the right thing to do,” said Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality. “We already decided that going cage-free was something that needed to happen and when USC ALIVE started petitioning, it just confirmed what we already knew and planned to do.”
USC Always Living In View of the Environment, an environmental student group, launched a campaign in November encouraging the university to serve only eggs from cage-free farms. According to USC ALIVE, residence halls currently serve students eggs from battery-cage farms where hens are kept in small, unsanitary cages.
More than 4,300 students signed the online petition, according to Connie Gao, a sophomore majoring in business administration and the group’s director of External Communications.
“This is something that is obviously very important to environmentally conscious students and soon all students who live on campus will have the option to choose cage-free eggs which is a very environmentally friendly choice,” Gao said.
Stanford, UCLA and several other universities in California already serve eggs from cage-free farms, which allow hens to roam and eat grass.
According to Klinger, eggs from cage-free farms possess dark yellow yokes This can add nutritional value to the egg.
Having cage-free eggs is both an animal rights issue and an environmental one because battery-cages can raise the risk of salmonella. Raising hens in battery-cages is also a high pollutant because of the lack of cleanliness, which leads to the spread of diseases, according to Gao.
“It’s about time,” said Richelle Gribble, a sophomore majoring in fine arts. “USC has not exactly made huge leaps compared to other colleges as far as becoming more environmentally conscious, so this cage-free switch is a huge improvement.”
Klinger a said buying these eggs imposes a significant cost on the university — $60,000 a year. Hospitality chose not to raise meal plan prices because of the cage-free initiative, however, so the university will absorb the expense, Klinger said.   
“$60,000 is enough money to pay the salaries of three full-time employees so we had to move funds around to pay for the switch and retain all of our staff,” Klinger said.
Elsa O’Callaghan, a senior majoring in communications, said she is concerned many students fail to recognize how important the cage-free switch is for promoting animal rights and environmental sustainability.
“I consider myself someone who is really environmentally-conscious and I had no idea USC was going cage-free until right now,” O’Callaghan said. “I’m very happy USC is doing this, but honestly I don’t think many students will take notice.”
USC already serves eggs from cage-free farms at Moreton Fig, Seeds Marketplace and other retail establishments on-campus, Klinger said, adding that he has not seen a significant difference in students’ dining habits.
“For students to appreciate the cage-free switch, the university has to fully publicize it, and also educate students so they know what cage-free means because most students don’t know the difference between a cage-free egg and a regular one,” O’Callaghan said.
Gribble said although the physical difference might be subtle, the cage-free initiative assures students the eggs they eat are healthy and come from hens living in relatively humane circumstances.
“Just knowing where your food comes from is really comforting,” Gribble said. “USC listened to those students concerned about animal rights but this switch is not just a victory for them but also a victory for the entire student body.”
This is wonderful! I’m so surprised by such negative comments here – it’s hard enough to get major change to happen at this school, so for ALIVE to manage to get dining to head in the right direction by refusing to purchase eggs from cruel battery cages is a positive step in the right direction. It may not be 100% cruelty-free, but if the people commenting really wanted to advocate for animal rights, they would choose to abstain from animal products and work to make that kind of large change happen at the school. Bottom line – what Connie and the students of ALIVE have done is amazing, and we should be thankful that a student group cares enough to speak up for these animals in the first place. 
And yes – this IS an environmental issue. Factory farms, like the battery cage facilities USC was originally purchasing their eggs from, are in the top 2 for contributors of water and air pollution in this country.
Congrats ALIVE and USC for making this change! Hopefully it will lead to more!
Battery cage eggs present animal rights and, according to the article, HEALTH issues, not environmental ones. I’m all for the cause, but terms like “environmental” and “pollutant” don’t belong in this article.
How much does USC currently spend per year on non-cage free eggs? $60,000 is a lot of money, but what is this cost compared to? How many eggs does USC consume per year?
There are some numbers missing in this article, but it’s still great to see USC committing to healthier, more environmentally-friendly food choices. Props to ALIVE for their action too!
Bigger cages; longer chains.
Way to go USC students and “environmentalists.”  You’re really advocating for animal rights, there.
How do the know the eggs came from cagefree chickens and not caged birds but in a cagefree carton?
All of the chickens live in a cage.  It’s just a matter of scale.  Of course, ALIVE thinks they’ve actually done something good, when really, they’ve continued to condone animal torture and exploitation.
There is nothing quite like a master who thinks he is kind to those he abuses.
Exactly! Who does ALIVE even think they’re helping? USC is surrounded by cages we choose to ignore….the thought cages professors trap students in, the merchandise cages that strip us of any free will, and the media cages which dictate our every move. 
Maybe ALIVE should forget the chickens and advocate for cage-free students.
I applaud ALIVE’s intentions to improve the environment of these chickens, but as Mr. Murray noted, USC students come first. USC is first and foremost an academic institution, not an animal-rights radical cult.
The increased costs of $60,000 detracts from the overall student experience, despite ALIVE’s good intentions. And as the old saying goes, “The road to hell is paved with good intentions.”
I agree that USC shouldn’t spend this money on this issue, but probably for a different reason–I think USC shouldn’t spend money on any animal products at all.  If individual students want to be responsible for the abuse of animals, they should pay for it on their own, on their own time and independently of the university.
what the hell are you talking about?
education sets you free.
and you dont have to go to this school if you feel trapped.
Interesting. I estimated last week that the savings of closing TroGro for 4 hours a night were roughly (at most) $50,000/year. Now they have a new $60,000 expense. Intriguing.

USC had to switch things up.
After being shut down by UCLA in the first two games of the weekend series, the Trojans (9-15, 1-2) went with a different lineup and defensive alignment Sunday afternoon at Dedeaux Field.
The baseball team faces UCLA in a rivalry game.
Interim coach Frank Cruz inserted walk-ons sophomore outfielder J.R. Aguirre and freshman catcher Kevin Swick into the lineup and moved senior Joe DePinto to centerfield, while pushing Kevin Roundtree to third base to get freshman Jake Hernandez into the lineup at catcher.
“[Aguirre and Swick] have been working hard in practice and have been taking some really good batting practice,” Cruz said. “They do everything that we ask of them.”
The move worked for Cruz. The Trojans got a pair of hits and runs from sophomore outfielder Aguirre and a huge day from junior first baseman Ricky Oropesa as they knocked off rival UCLA (11-8, 2-1) 6-2. The win evens the season series 2-2.
The Trojans got on the board early Sunday. Batting leadoff in his first career start, Aguirre got his first career hit on a double after UCLA’s right fielder Jeff Gelalich lost the ball in the sun.
A sacrifice bunt and an infield single by Oropesa got the Trojans on the board. USC manufactured another run in the second inning and Oropesa hit a two-run blast to centerfield in the third inning made the score 4-1.
That was enough for senior starting pitcher Logan Odom. For the second time this season, Odom held the Bruins’ bats at bay.
Odom allowed only two singles and one run in seven innings of work to lower his ERA to 3.31 and improve his record to 2-3.
“It’s always special to beat a crosstown rival, especially when it counts now for the Pac-10,” Odom said. “Gaining momentum going into the next series is really important. We competed all weekend long against a really good team, but it feels really good to get that win.”
In the first two games of the series, the Trojans couldn’t get enough runs against UCLA’s pair of junior aces, Gerrit Cole and Trevor Bauer. Both are likely to be first-round draft picks in Major League Baseball’s June amateur draft, and they showed why.
On Friday, USC got to Cole early with solo home runs by freshman shortstop James Roberts and Oropesa. But the Bruins responded with four runs in the fourth inning, three coming on a bases-clearing double by catcher Steve Rodriguez.
Though Cole didn’t have his best outing, he flashed the talent that could make him the No. 1 pick in the MLB draft, with reports that he hit 101 mph on the radar gun.
Cole allowed seven hits and four earned runs in six and two-thirds innings. His offense backed him up, but the Bruins tacked on three runs in the top of the sixth inning and another in the seventh, and USC didn’t get it closer than the final 8-4 tally.
Though Cole wasn’t his best, Bauer was nearly flawless.
It wasn’t until the seventh inning that Roberts ended Bauer’s perfect-game attempt with a walk. He drew another free pass in the ninth, an inning after sophomore infielder Adam Landecker broke up the no-hitter with a grounder through the middle.
Bauer baffled the Trojans with his five-pitch arsenal, including a fastball recorded at 97 mph on one of his final pitches in the ninth inning. He struck out 14 batters to become UCLA’s all-time career strikeout leader (329).

Nobody fantasizes about playing basketball for USC.  They don’t long for the Galen Center, or Kevin O’Neill, or the “Trojan Fever” fanatics or being frontcourt mates with Alex Stepheson.
What college basketball players fantasize about is being selected by one of 30 NBA teams in the annual June draft, which subsequently ushers in multi-million dollar contracts and the potential to give the Tiger Woods treatment to willing parties nightly. That’s the mind set: Getting paid to play basketball trumps being a student-athlete, despite what the NCAA commercials say.
During a Friday afternoon press conference, USC’s Nikola Vucevic echoed such sentiments.
“After consulting with K.O. and my family for a couple weeks, I have decided to skip my senior year and enter the NBA draft,” he said.
So that’s it. Following a season in which the Trojan big man averaged 17.1 points and 10.3 rebounds per games, he’s jumping on the first train out of town.
And take note: There is no turning back at this point. By hiring the Los Angeles-based Serbian native Rade Filipovich as his agent, Vucevic is headed to the professional ranks one way or the other, whether it’s the NBA, Italy or Spain. Per NCAA rules, he is no longer eligible to return to USC, so grab a Kleenex and wipe away those tears.
“If you do something, you have to go into it, 100 percent,” he said when asked about his decision to hire an agent. “Testing the waters usually doesn’t end that well.”
Doing so, however, caught many by surprise. Most anticipated Vucevic would not sign with an agent, and thus retain his college eligibility before waiting until the May 8 deadline to make a final decision whether to stay or go.
“The decision wasn’t about our team or the university,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “It was about Nick.”
It most definitely was. What Vucevic’s declaration says is that, for his growth as a player, it’d be more beneficial to develop in Europe than under O’Neill’s wing.
“If Vucevic and agent like what they’re hearing, he’ll stay in [the draft] … If not, has a great backup plan in Europe and can try draft again in 2012,” Jonathan Givony of DraftExpress.com tweeted Friday night. “Great argument to be made that Vucevic can develop faster, improve stock playing in Europe over USC … [O’Neill] more interested in getting drunk, getting into fights at bar instead of preparing for crucial game.”
Though he made his intentions to play in the NBA rather clear, there is no guarantee Kid Euro won’t be returning to his native Europe instead. Presently, most mock drafts project the 6-foot-10 forward to be a late second round pick, which makes his future even muddier.
By being selected in the latter portion of the draft, Vucevic would not be given a guaranteed contract, and based on his performance in the summer league, could later be relegated to his respective team’s NBA Development League squad.
In short, a draft selection, particularly in the second round, does not necessarily equate to instant NBA success, and as a result, Vucevic might opt for a year or two overseas in order to fine-tune his skills before making the jump.
And there is no doubt playing in Europe would present tougher competition than another year of playing in the Pac-10. Just ask Brandon Jennings.
Jennings, a decorated high school point guard prospect, opted to play for Lottomatica Roma in Italy instead of a season for Lute Olson at the University of Arizona.
Though the future Milwaukee Bucks draft pick didn’t necessarily post the best numbers (5.5 points and 2.2 assists per game) during his year on the other side of the Atlantic, the carryover to the NBA was noticeable, as he averaged 15.5 points per game while being named to the All-Rookie first team in his initial season.
With a potential NBA lockout on the horizon, however, the Europe option gains even more traction.
With a work stoppage threatening to postpone games next season until December or January, it’s possible the normal 82-game slate could be cut in half, and thus encourage players such as Vucevic to play professionally elsewhere.
The goal for most college players is to achieve NBA stardom. So it comes down to this for Vucevic: Which ensures better long-term success, another year at USC under O’Neill or a short stint in Europe?
That’s an easy one, really. Go east, young man.

Hailed by some music lovers as a great addition to the punk and hard rock genres alike, it would seem Rise Against is confident in its identity, but Endgame proves that might not be.
Negative outlook · The tracks in Endgame contain characteristic punk or hard rock angst but mostly fail to present anything more. - Photo courtesy of Big Hassle  
A blend between ambiguous anarchistic rebellion á la classical teenage angst with attempts to sound like Rage Against the Machine, Rise Against charges itself with a seemingly impossible task: in its newest album: how to get across the same emotions found in every other punk and hard rock album.
Predictably, the formula includes lots of angry screaming, packed lyrics and a drum beat that doesn’t let up. But where Rise Against managed to set itself aside in past albums with striking lyricism, heartfelt singing and the juxtaposition of hard rock vibes with more sensitive tones, Endgame creates a sound equally timid and predictably textbook.
Just glancing at the CD booklet  explains a lot. The lyrics are packed into their squares and small messages are off to the side, suggesting works by Jonathan Safran Foer for the rebellion-happy listener to peruse later.
In the end, the band tries to stay genuine to the hard rock and punk genres by offering a plethora of thrashing sounds, but includes textbook hard rock sounds that leave the listener with little to hang on to. By not even including basic elements like guitar solos in the majority of their tracks, the guys fail to completely show off their musical talents and versatility. The entire album falls into a we’re-hard-rock rut so fully most tracks end up blending into each other.
“Satellite” at least offers engaging rhythms. But the listener is insulted with lyrics like She told me that she never could face the world again / So I offered up a plan: We’ll sneak out while they sleep. In comparison to tracks like “Savior” from the band’s 2008 album Appeal to Reason, which include lines like as the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is dropping / through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten, the song is bereft both of any original subject matter and of the emotionally engaging songwriting Rise Against is perfectly capable of crafting.
Aside from the intriguing punk beat found in “Satellite” and other tracks, most of the songs go on for too long.
“Disparity Design” is markedly mosh pit-friendly from the beginning and the guitar strikes some nice chords, but the track would’ve benefited from a guitar solo to break up the otherwise relentless noise.
“Architects” attempts to add variety with tempo and rhythm changes, but it is ultimately a fragmented, discordant track. This makes it difficult for the listener to get into the groove of the song, and its dramatic ending comes too abruptly.
“Midnight Hands” has metal-influenced chords that automatically reel the listener in. The track sounds more confident and the sound flows more freely. It’s a gutsy creation that makes you wonder how lead singer Tim McIlrath still has a functioning voice.
The shorter verses feel more meaningful, and instead of the usual punk rock classic man-versus-government lyrics, these words feel more sincere and mysterious. Sadly, this energy does not carry through the majority of the album.
Where the listener was once challenged to take a breath and digest everything in just the first few lines of a Rise Against track, this new album dumbs the listener down completely.
Though the album might appeal to your 14-year old brother, this isn’t the characteristically complex work the band is obviously capable of producing. The listener doesn’t need an onslaught of hard rock staples. It would just be nice to get the guys back.

Miral, the new Palestine-set film from painter-turned-director Julian Schanbel, has arrived in theaters amid a symphony of howls and hisses from the American Jewish Committee and the Israeli government. 
In other words, a PR director’s wet dream. For Schanbel’s sake, I hope the fury doesn’t die quickly, because for all the fussing and fretting, Miral is a holy mess.
The film’s titular heroine (Slumdog Millionaire’s Freida Pinto) is a teenage Palestinian girl coming of age in a Jerusalem boarding school for orphans during the First Intifada of 1987.
The event, and a meeting with a handsome militant (Omar Metwally), pull the passionate Miral toward the teeth of violent resistance against the Israeli military, much to the dismay of her protective father (Alexander Siddig) and the school’s matronly head, Mama Hind (Hiam Abbass).
The film is greatly affected by the fact that, like directors Peter Bogdanovich and Roger Vadim before him, Schanbel took the artistically treacherous step of marrying a coworker: the film’s writer, Rula Jebreal.
An Italian TV journalist, Jebreal’s own experiences growing up in Palestine served as the framework for Miral, which Schnabel seems to have made as a love letter to his wife, as opposed to the uncompromising work of political provocation the film has been wrongly produced as.
Interestingly, Schnabel’s latest work is most captivating in its opening 30 minutes, before we meet Miral.
In a smart storytelling move, Schabel begins the proceedings in 1948, shortly after the founding of Israel, at a Christmas party in Jerusalem. In attendance, other than the bizarrely cast Willem DaFoe and Vanessa Redgrave, is the young Mama Hind, on the cusp of founding the film’s orphanage.
We follow her, along with Miral’s brutalized future mother (Yasmine Elmasri) through decades of heartbreak, ethnic tensions and violence.
Here, the audacious, visionary Schnabel, who took us inside the eyes and soul of a stroke victim in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, flickers back to life.
The bone-dry hills of Haifa and the watchful, wordless Mediterranean are painted in quieting shades of blue and gray.
Sometimes, Schnabel’s camera bobs toward an empty, seemingly peaceful sky, in a country where the thought of a god has inspired so much bloodshed.
It’s a stunning metaphor, and a sad glimmer of where Miral might have gone had Schnabel not been snogging the source material.
Indeed, once Miral reaches adolescence, the whole project goes up in flames. We leap between locations and incidents with little context.
Pinto alternates between blissful stoicism and blissful rage. Family members we’ve never seen before are given spontaneous, lengthy asides.  Characters say things like, “He’s a patriot,” and “This is a very crucial moment for our country.”
Would it have been too much to phone Tony Kushner for some lessons in writing human dialogue?
The duty was handed to Jubreal and she misses the mark painfully, favoring idealism over everyday life.
We’re never allowed to forget that Miral is an important film, and yet, it comes off as a slovenly work of self-indulgence.
Perhaps Schnabel and Jubreal were so determined to adapt the latter’s life they never stopped to consider whether it was worthy of such grandiose treatment.
There have been far more compelling stories of those on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide.
 
Hany Abu-Assad’s Paradise Now and its unsure suicide bombers remains the finest filmed effort of the last 10 years.
The story was fictional, but the human dilemmas unbearably real.
Even Spielberg’s occasionally overwrought Munich sketched a blistering series of afterthoughts on the violence that has itself become a dialogue in the Middle East.
Though it would likely pain Schnabel to hear this, Miral is as sheltered as the walled orphanage.
The destruction of Palestinian homes, the car bombings and those shot dead by the Israel Defense Forces at demonstrations are a mere backdrop, for what almost resembles a Horatio Alger tale, as Miral is eventually taken under the wing of an experienced journalist at a hotel and groomed for a life of broadcasts.
Schnabel would do well to consider that one masterpiece does not make him a master of all works.
Well-intentioned as Miral might be, it’s ultimately too shallow and forgettable to have a lasting impact on what remains a tragic, almost hopeless conflict of religious and territorial intolerance.
“Well-intentioned as Miral might be, it’s ultimately too shallow and forgettable to have a lasting impact on what remains a tragic, almost hopeless conflict of religious and territorial intolerance.”
If the author knew anything at all about this so-called “conflict” – it isn’t a conflict.  It is a brutal six-decades old military occupation and land theft project.  Period.  It has absolutely nothing to do with religion, other than Zionists have hyjacked the Jewish religion to falsely claim right to murder people for land that the land’s owners have inhabited for eons.  The territorial intolerance the author speaks of is the intolerance of invading hordes of heavily-armed murauders who initially cleansed the land in 1948, and who are continuing to displace people and murder outright those who are legitimately and legally (Fourth Geneva Convention, International Declaration of Human Rifghts, World Court etc.) resisting their occupiers and torturers.

Let’s be honest: It’s difficult for us college students to make room in our schedules for a decent workout. Even with a gym, a track and numerous fitness classes on campus, not everybody has the time or the energy to go for a morning jog.
And it’s not just the lack of free time that’s the problem. As college students, we’re infamous for being generally cash-strapped.
But in a world that thrives on convenience, isn’t there a fast, flexible and cheap way for students to stay fit?
Meet the exercise ball.
Yes, those bulky, oversized spheres might sound annoying and even somewhat dangerous. But surprisingly, the exercise or fitness ball is one of the most effective tools for improving core strength.
The exercise ball was originally used in various physical therapy regimens. In the past few years, however, the popular fitness tool has become an increasingly fundamental part of  daily fitness routines.
The exercise ball is easy to use and can be integrated into for various types of workouts.
The simplest and most common exercises include sit-ups, crunches and squats.
But if you’re craving a little more of a challenge, try adding in some weight training, stretching, yoga or even Pilates and you’ve got yourself a solid workout regimen.
The way the exercise ball works is relatively simple. When your body detects the unsteadiness of the ball, it causes your muscles, specifically those located in your core, to engage more to help you remain balanced and still. The exercise ball primarily works the abdomen and the back muscles.
You don’t have to use exercise balls for hardcore workouts, though. In fact, you can use them without even feeling like you’re working out at all.
Many people claim there are numerous benefits to replacing overused computer desk chairs with exercise balls. Sitting on an exercise ball is said to improve back health because your need to balance also works to correct your posture.
And according to a 2007 study by the Mayo Clinic, one of Minnesota’s top medical centers, exercise balls have more than just physical benefits.
The study worked with several groups of students in different elementary schools and replaced regular classroom chairs with exercise balls. The results were fascinating: Exercise balls not only promoted healthy movement but also seemed to improve children’s abilities to concentrate.
Such a find shouldn’t be ignored in the college world. For students stressed and eager to finish late-night essays, exercise balls might just be the key to staying focused and alert.  A comfy chair is the kiss of death when it comes to finishing homework. But if we simply replace our sleep-inducing furniture with exercise balls when the time calls, the results could be overwhelmingly positive.
Another study produced similar results. It found that college students preferred exercise balls to regular chairs. The exercise balls not only allowed for comfort but also the ability to focus better, even at a college level.
Of course, college students won’t simply invest in exercise balls because of a few studies. But one of the best reasons to consider purchasing one is simply because they are cheap.
Exercise balls can be purchased online at prices as low as $15, depending on the size. If you plan to buy one, however, make sure to get one that corresponds to your height. As long as you can sit comfortably with your feet on the ground, you’ll know the ball is right for you.
If you’re worried about the exercise balls being able to hold your weight, have no fear. Companies such as Ball Dynamics sell exercise balls specifically designed to carry heavier people.
You don’t need to have much money or time to use the exercise ball to its full potential. But don’t give up on it before even giving it a shot. You might be surprised at what it can do for you, both physically and mentally.

Sucker Punch is a movie about a girl imagining herself as a superhero who shoots a lot of bad guys while dressed as a Japanese schoolgirl. That summary alone should save any moviegoer 10 bucks.  
To its credit, the PG-13 movie, directed, produced and co-written by Zach Snyder (300), does try to bring across an inspirational message about self-empowerment and all that jazz.
But what is ultimately portrayed is a mash-up of trite genres with constant action, pulsating rock music and riddled with just enough cleavage and not enough soul.
The only things worthy of your time here are the visuals. As expected based on Snyder’s trademark stylized computer-generated effects, the slow-moving choreography and the imaginative cinematography are stunning.
The film starts out in thunder and darkness, and through the crack of the splattered window you see the back of a gleaming, ghostly blonde.
Soon, in slow-motion, 20-year-old Baby Doll (Emily Browning, who with her white-blonde hair, full lips, and fake eyelashes, really does look like a baby doll) is shown wrestling with her stepfather, then accidentally shooting her sister.
Loud, electronic music drowns out the dialogue in the scene, and by the time Baby Doll is locked into a mental institution, audience members are mesmerized and at the edge of their seats.
Unfortunately, that initial interest dissipates, as the film becomes about non-stop action and loud noises.
In the mental institution, Baby Doll meets four other institutionalized young women: Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens) and Amber (Jamie Chung). With their newfound camaraderie, they plan an escape together.
The sequence, however, is not clear, as Baby Doll suddenly starts imagining being sold to a brothel and her escape plan formulates within her imagination. In fact, life in the mental institution is hardly shown at all; the majority of the film takes place in Baby Doll’s mind.
The brothel, which resembles a set borrowed from Moulin Rouge, is governed by a statuesque dance mistress with an Eastern European accent (Carla Gurgino) and a creepy mustached pimp (Oscar Isaac). There is also an obese, pockmarked cook and a rotund cigar-sucking mayor. All the females are dressed like the backup dancers in Chicago.
Baby Doll’s imagination takes on another level of incredulity when she realizes she can dance really well. All she needs to do is to transport her mind into another imaginative body, this time clad in a skimpy Sailor Moon outfit, swinging a samurai sword at massive machine warriors, Nazi steam-zombies and fire-breathing dragons.
Despite the shifting between escape from physical imprisonment and escape from reality, the plot is quite simple: The girls need to get four items to escape within five days, because that is when a doctor (Jon Hamm) is coming to lobotomize Baby Doll (or, in the bordello world, take her virginity).
All the battle scenes take place while Baby Doll dances and looks like a character in  an Xbox world. Rock is always blaring, and you almost expect to see points accumulating on the side of the screen as Baby Doll and her team somersault, karate-chop and machine-gun in high heels and skin-tight costumes to kill the bad guys and complete their quest.
In classic Charlie’s Angels fashion, these girls also have a stern-looking Wiseman (Scott Glenn) to guide them through their escape. He takes turns donning monk robes, or military attire depending on the backdrop, and doesn’t do much except look tough and fatherly.
The plot itself is original and could have been a good story, but the film falls flat because little attention was given to the storytelling itself.
It is as if Snyder hopes by giving a toned-down version of a pubescent male’s wet dream come true, the audience will forgive the dull, one-dimensional characters and mostly wordless scenes.
With all these factors in mind, Sucker Punch is a noble attempt at producing a novel film, but would be much better as a video game for teenagers with schoolgirl fantasies.
Zach Snyder might be a brilliant picturemaker, but even the most visually attractive movie is dull without dramatic craft and humanized characters.

The USC men’s volleyball team did not have another letdown against Pepperdine, redeeming itself against the team that had previously ruined its chance at a perfect season.
The No. 1 Trojans took down the No. 13 Waves in straight sets with scores of 25-17, 25-22, 28-26 at the Galen Center, notching their 10th straight win.
Senior opposite Murphy Troy and senior outside hitter Tri Bourne led USC (16-1, 15-1) with 16 kills each. Troy hit .394 and Bourne hit .483, while also adding nine digs.
Pepperdine (8-12, 4-12) handed the Trojans their only loss early this season in a hostile Malibu gym.
“We played a great overall match with a heightened level of focus,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “We served them out of system and made them predicable.”
In the first match between the two teams, Pepperdine forced USC out of system throughout the match with tough serving.
“The passing was awesome,” said senior setter Riley McKibbin. “And our guys were really feeling it. All I had to do was put the ball up and they were great.”
With the return of senior middle blocker Austin Zahn and the emergence of a formidable backrow quick attack from Bourne and junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, USC was efficient, finishing with a .382 hitting percentage to Pepperdine’s .252.
“We got their defense crammed in the middle early the match with the bic and the middle,” Ferguson said. “After that, Troy, Bourne and Ciarelli were left with a lot of single blocks.”
Pepperdine matched up 6’9” junior middle blocker Matt Pollock on Zahn in an effort to contain him.
“He’s a big dude and it’s not easy to play against him,” Zahn said. “I moved my hitting routes around and made sure that their blocking scheme wouldn’t work.”
The Trojans also played stellar defense to complement their efficient offense. Entering the third set, the Trojans blocked 17 balls while the Waves managed only one. Zahn finished with a match-best seven blocks.
“We’ve been working on blocking all week long,” Zahn said. “It was great to finally play them and have such a successful night blocking.”
Pepperdine drew the match to a deuce in the third set. They managed to hit .357 and collect five blocks in a single-set period of revival.
The Trojans, however, exhibited the resilience that has become the trademark of their successful season.
With the score tied at 10-10, Troy and Bourne viciously killed over-passes in back-to-back points.
Later in the set, the 6’2” McKibbin showed his mettle and craftiness against Pepperdine’s explosive 6’7” sophomore opposite Maurice Torres when he outmuscled him to put down a ball that floated between them.
“It felt really good when I beat him on the joust,” McKibbin said. “As a setter, I don’t get many chances to attack, so jousting is my specialty.”
With the score tied at 26-26, Ciarelli viciously bounced a quick outside set off the line and high over the Pepperdine defense.
“I was stoked when Riley set me then because I passed the ball and got in rhythm,” Ciarelli said. “I saw it and put it away.”
The victory did not elicit ideas of revenge against Pepperdine, but rather a sense of closure.
“We finally took down our last assistant coach’s alma mater,” McKibbin said.

Coming into this weekend, USC coach Richard Gallien knew that his group of girls would have a tough homestand as they were set to square off against the No. 10 California Golden Bears and No. 2 Stanford Cardinal.
On Friday against No. 10 Cal (12-4, 3-0), senior Maria Sanchez had her 22-match winning streak snapped by Jana Juricova, who was seeking revenge for a defeat at the hands of Sanchez during last year’s ITA National Indoor Championship singles championship. Juricova, a junior, dug out of a 1-0 hole to take the last two sets 6-2, 6-1 from Sanchez, extending her singles match winning streak to 15.
The Golden Bears shrugged off an early loss in doubles to win in all but one single’s match (freshman Kaitlyn Christian defeated No. 57 Annie Goransson 6-0, 6-4) on the day.
Christian has made great strides throughout the season and her continued development was evident this weekend against top competition.
Although she would lose to No. 11 Nicole Gibbs 6-3, 7-6 (6-3) on Saturday, Christian displayed great poise and in the face of defeat, she responded accordingly.
Facing Stanford (16-0, 4-0) on a cloudy Saturday afternoon, only Sanchez seeking revenge for her past day’s loss taking down No. 2 Hilary Barte on court one proved to be a bright spot, as the Cardinal would finish the day up 6-1.
Despite falling down 3-0 in the first set, Sanchez would rally to win 12 of the next 15 sets, never relinquishing momentum to keep USC within striking distance in the match.
For the rest of the Women of Troy, fatigue, both mentally and physically, seemed to set in, especially with the injuries continuing to mount.
On court four, sophomore Valeria Pulido, returning from injury this weekend, was able to make it through her first match on Friday, a 6-4, 6-4 loss to Cal’s Anett Schutting, but her match against the Cardinal’s No. 21 Kristie Ahn would prove to be too stressful for Pulido’s foot as she would end up retiring 4-6, 6-0.
Battling through ailments of her own, No. 25 Danielle Lao has seen her recent struggles continue after losses against Cal and Stanford.
While Lao did show life in her back-and-forth match against the Golden Bears’ Mari Andersson on court two Friday afternoon, she would fall easily the next day to No. 29 Mallory Burdette 6-1, 6-3.
The junior’s losing streak, which has now reached three matches, has not-so-coincidentally corresponded with the Women of Troy’s three-match skid.
Her experience and winning ways was a catalyst early on for USC, but recently she has failed to properly complement the No. 1 Sanchez from her two spot.
Junior Alison Ramos ran into two ranked roadblocks over the course of the weekend, losing, albeit valiantly, in straight sets to both Cal’s No. 48 Tayler Davis and Stanford’s No. 51 Stacey Tan.
Along with Ramos, senior Cristala Andrews also struggled to find victory, going down quietly to the Golden Bears’ Marina Cossou 6-2, 6-3, before putting in a spirited performance against Carolyn Mcveigh in a  4-6, 7-5, 1-0 (10-6) loss on Saturday.
With their match against Oregon looming, the No. 13 Women of Troy will look to get back to their winning ways as they hope to make strides in the Pac-10 with four conference games still ahead.

By now, the news of the viral email linked to the Kappa Sigma Fraternity has spread through both campus and national media. Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson sent an email to the USC community condemning the email, and female-oriented sites such as Jezebel have decried the misogynistic viewpoints expressed.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojan
Officials have said the email did not originate from the USC chapter of Kappa Sigma, but it still reflects poorly on the fraternities, Greek life and, quite frankly, the male population at USC.
But we might be examining the problem from the wrong angle.
Finger-pointers seem to use the chauvinistic “frat boy” characterizations as an easy excuse for why such an email was allowed to spread.
The blame has been focused on males and the Greek system instead of addressing the larger underlying issue: sorority girl stereotypes.
Amid the email’s unsavory descriptions of girls as “targets” who are “not real people,” is the disparaging term “sorostitute.”
A combination of the words “sorority girl” and “prostitute,” this word embodies how many people perceive sorority girls: as slutty, empty-headed and disrespectable.
Although there isn’t a pervasive misogynistic culture at USC, there are a shocking number of commonly accepted stereotypes of sorority girls.
Though the email prompted outrage and condemnation from the USC community and beyond, people accept the day-to-day belittling of sorority girls without second thought.
Media portrayals of sorority girls — think Reese Witherspoon’s performance in Legally Blonde — only perpetuate the belief that all sorority girls are blond, drunk, vacuously stupid and likely to spend each night with a random male.
I am far from a blazing feminist, but as a sorority girl myself, I can attest that not only are these beliefs false and offensive, but also that more people than will admit hold these damaging stereotypes.
Since joining Sigma Phi Omega, an Asian-interest social sorority at USC, I have noticed how people change their demeanor the moment I mention my involvement with a sorority.
I suddenly become someone immoral who buys her friends, is probably just here to get married and takes facile courses.
Not only are non-Greek students less likely to take sorority girls seriously, but even professors and teaching assistants sometimes make the same assumptions.
A bitingly intelligent friend who frequently sported Pi Phi gear was asked by her TA last semester if she took school seriously or was just here to party.
Not all sorority girls are promiscuous alcoholics who smoke, do drugs and crash seven different parties every weekend. Personally, I don’t drink and don’t participate in any of the other activities mentioned, and I know many Greek-affiliated girls who also choose not to.
Of course, as with many stereotypes, some do conform more or less to the popularly conceptualized “sorority girl.”
But most of us are not the air-headed, graceless women we are unfairly assumed to be.
In fact, last year and for many years, the average GPA of the Panhellenic Council has been higher than both the all-university and all-women’s average at USC.  In 2010, the Panhellenic average was 3.41, compared to the all-women’s average of 3.34 and the all-university average of 3.27.
Many sorority girls are motivated and talented young women who lead our generation in philanthropy, development of leadership capabilities and high standards of scholarship and self-respect.
Those who believe otherwise after simply a cursory glance at whichever Greek letters we proudly display are as small-minded and obtuse as the “sorostitute” of their imagination.
 
Rebecca Gao is a freshman majoring in global health and biological sciences. Her column, “Trojan Grounds,” runs Mondays.
a) Asian-interest social sorority girl not a drunk sex addict! Who would have guessed! You are not in a real sorority- at least not what people think about when you mention USC’s sororities.
b) Many of those sororities are like that.
c) Not a ‘blazing feminist’? Why the hell not? Those women got you the vote, fought for equal rights in the workplace, fought against sexual discrimination and harassment. If you are trying to buck the idea of sorority girls as unthinking morons, you are not doing a great job with comments like that.
d) The original fuss was over some idiot who wrote a seriously stupid (and unfunny btw- Tucker Max is a moron) email that was offensive to women and racist. I don’t think pointing out that sorority girls are not prostitutes was strictly necessary. It was kind of implicit in the outrage…
e) Why does the Daily Trojan constantly print these ‘worthy’ yet unintelligent and boring articles? Print something funny, or something that pokes at the administration. or do some actual reporting. Or get some people with outrageous opinions. Or report at some events. Or something.
I totally agree with E. I gained nothing by reading this article.
“Although there isn’t a pervasive misogynistic culture at USC….”  = FALSE. 
Are you even paying attention?
Rebecca,
I wholeheartedly agree with you. The women in the sorority system can’t exist as two-faced image of being well-groomed intellectuals as well as brainless Ke$ha clones. Misogyny is a two-way street – if these ladies portray themselves as glittered hookers when they go out, men won’t take them seriously. There are obviously exceptions to every rule, and I know sorority members who are fine, upstanding members of society. But the presence of girls such as the one who will get a guy off at the top of WPH in broad daylight are those to blame for this ever pervasive stereotype. Well done.
I understand your point is that there are pervasive sorority stereotypes that try to generalize all sorority girls into certain traits.  And its bad, wrong etc. I understand that, but what you’re doing is discounting a misogynistic classification of women by saying that the stereotypes of poor poor sorority girls are to blame.  And it also sounds like your talking about non greeks, non greeks who you feel stereotype sorority girls as a general rule based upon your letters.  When really you should, especially because of this email, be looking towards the greek system for an explanation as to why this kind of behavior is not taken seriously.
The real point is that being a ‘frat guy’ and living up to the stereotype is not an excuse for the email.   You don’t have to be a ‘blazing’ feminist to understand that this kind of thinking, environment and treatment of women isn’t something that should be just let go easily or disregarded.  These are the future leaders of our country.  Boys in fraternities that will eventually become men.. CEO’s, professionals that will treat their female EQUALS as inferior because of stereotypes based upon gender, not sorority or fraternity membership.
Listen, an “underwater basketweaving” major, with a 3.5+ GPA, even from say, an Ivy, is commensurate to someone who went to some generic state school with the same major, GPA, and so forth. 
An engineering major from say, MIT, with a sub 3.0 GPA has got more clout than someone who attended a generic state school with the same major but somewhat higher GPA; this isn’t always true, but more often than not, it is. 
Some universities’ GPA-deflation practice is more rigorous than others. Using strawman arguments about sorrority girls with competitive GPAs is BS, not “bachelor of science.”
I dont mean to support the stereotype, but by my observation, sorority GPA is usually higher due to greater use of adderall and to other forms of cheating.
Also, I don’t understand why smart, self-respecting girls choose to affiliate themselves with groups that have a bad reputation.
i’d be curious to see what a drug test of the greek community would show versus a drug test of the non-greek community.
Stop perpetuating such hurtful and degrading stereotypes. It’s demeaning and rude and spreads hatred.  I’m in a sorority, am getting my BS in mathematics, and have a 3.6 GPA.  I don’t use Adderall or other drugs, nor do I cheat, and neither do the girls in my sorority.  I know them, and you do not.  If you’re not in a sorority, you can’t possibly know what the majority of girls in them do. The few that you observe that cheat isn’t an adequate sample size. When you generalize like you’re doing it blemishes the reputations of girls like me–someone you don’t even know.
Also, I’ll tell you why I joined.  It’s a place that where I feel at home.  My sisters are sweet and supportive.  It’s like having a family right there with you at school.  I wasn’t going to turn such things down because “sororities have a bad reputation.” That’s just perpetuating the stereotype.
Well written. Rational. Logical.

Sigma Phi Omega: Not a real sorority.
How do you define a “real” sorority?
a Panhellenic one
then you clearly no nothing. get outta here
I doubt you go to USC if you can’t even bring yourself to type “know” instead of “no.”
NEWSFLASH: They mean two different things!
Sororities, ladies and gentlemen!
You should check your facts RE: “Media portrayals of sorority girls — think Reese Witherspoon’s performance in Legally Blonde — only perpetuate the belief that all sorority girls are blond, drunk, vacuously stupid and likely to spend each night with a random male.” 
I’m insulted in how you are using Elle Woods as a model for the common perception of sorority girls. In fact, she isn’t a slut–she only had one boyfriend and was in a committed relationship. She also didn’t use sex to get ahead in her career. 
Most importantly, if you remember, she went to the Harvard Law School, where she gave the senior speech at graduation. 
Bad example. 
Come on with these comments guys–so don’t put so much energy into fluff articles! :-)
The problem with the USC Sorority stereotype, is that  in general, it is right on the mark.
But it’s not all their fault. The lack of maturity and highly developed sense of “Prima Donna” behaviour starts in the home at an early age. Now you put them all together in a Sorority house and exactly what do you expect? The glaring light of self-awareness is not coming down 28th Street.
While writing this I’m thinking of a young sorority girl two weeks ago; jumping into a crowded elevator on campus, while continuing to yell about boyfriend problems into her cell phone. When reminded that she was on a crowded elevator, she barely paused in her diatribe to respond with a withering “So?”
Coincidentally that one word “so?” is the number one pick-up line at the 9-0!
Gotta love losers like andrew tellling people he doesnt know to grow up so they can be as mature as he is….Andrew spends alot of weekends alone….fact, once you become a proffesional, no one cares what your GPA was…all they care about is the quality of your work, leadership capability, and your problem solving skills…and most of those folks have social skills, and know how to move in the political world of an office. Guess what, experience in the Fraternity and Soroity life prepares you for those skills. Thats why most successful people are greek. wahhh for the non-greeks.
simply put…most non-greeks are jealous. They make these sterotypes in their heads to make them selves feel better. Truth is, most of the top successful people are greek…true stuff.
Have you seen the photos?
An unfortunate yet funny coincidence that this was posted fairly close to the time that the WPH incident occurred…
We live in a funny society. Stereotyping people becomes taboo only if there are threads of truth to the profile. It is because the broad-brushing usually depicts the individual members of the said group rather accurately and it is this accuracy that scares and offends people. What is funny is to not stereotype goes against every human instinct we possess. We judge ALL pitbulls differently from ALL labradors because we are just playing the odds. Sure you might get bitten by that one rogue labrador or miss the opportunity to befriend a strange pitbull but we are just a collection of our past experiences and knowledge we absorb from walking this world and we behave accordingly.
Now there are some rules to stereotyping people. White, blonde sorority girls can be stereotyped negatively because these girls are perceived to be free off real challenges in life. Juxtapose that with the Black Engineering students fraternity – if a member from that fraternity should misbehave or commit a criminal act – can you imagine the outrage if we broadbrushed that fraternity as a gang of thugs? Yes we stereotype and yes we judge people who stereotype and we even stereotype the ones who stereotype as being intolerant and racist. Just remember, pretty, blonde beautiful sorority girls from Brentwood should be given every right to be stereotyped or not stereotyped as black students on full scholarship from South Central.
Funny how frats and sororities are always saying their GPAs are higher than average….  If true, it leads me to think they’re (a) cheating or (b) using Ritalin.  
Wait’ll you grow up and realize what the rest of the world thinks of you….
It could be because they are hotter.  I always graded hot chicks easier.  Tried not to but its tough
most of the “real world” won’t ask us which frat or sorority we were in during college. however, alumni connections and better social skills will help out in the long run.
also, being in a sorority or fraternity while juggling and getting a better GPA than the non-greek GPA demonstrates our ability to handle a full academic schedule, philanthropic events, and social calendar.  if we can manage all of that, it proves we’re not just bubbly, air-headed idiots.
and come on.. only cheating or using ritalin? that’s so extremely pig-headed.
sorry to disappoint, but the cheating and drug use is more frequently occurring in the greek community, just as are fake ids. and if you dont know that, i feel bad for you.
its easier to get test answers and pills because everyone knows someone who has or can get them. also, greeks usually  have the money to spend
The oft used argument for Penhellenic academic superiority is flawed because it fails to take into account the difference in distribution of majors between non-sorority and sorority girls. Easier majors often translate to higher GPAs. Sorry, but your 3.7 GPA in your Mrs. degree does not hold up the the 3.2 of an engineer. I assume that SG are more frequently enrolled in easier majors than other women, but my assumption is probably true.
I acknowledge that some sorority girls are bright and do well academically, but many of their sisters are enrolled in joke majors and are indeed mostly here to party.
Thank you. BA majors are a joke. Actually science, technology and medicine based academic endeavors don’t even break the 3.0 mark often times from the cutthroat curves. A 3.2, I think, is “good” for a BS, no BullShyt here, nor pun intended. And no, Marshall b-school isn’t a bonafide BS. Sorry b-school students, “creative income reporting/financial anaylysis” based on arbitrary tax laws =/= rigorous major. 
Who was that crybaby who wrote in the DT about med school only admitting the top 8% and thought it wasn’t fair?
perhaps, a BA class or two would teach you how to communicate. your writing is appallingly awful.
I love the use of the thesaurus : easy to facile! Wow you are so well-read! This is embarrassing.
Actually, there is a wide range of majors in the Panhellenic community, not just “Mrs” degrees, as you call it. Do you have factual evidence to back up your point? Panhellenic has done surveys of the Greek community that indicate your stereotypes about “Mrs” degrees are fairly inaccurate. I suggest knowing the facts before you go around bashing an entire community.
Seriously! Was just about to say this.
Sure, sororities tout “diverse majors” — but, let’s be real. How many sorority girls do you know who are engineering, art (include creative writing), biology, math or music (singing doesn’t count!) majors? These programs require an immense amount of dedication and usually a higher number of units than most BA’s at USC.
Now, I know a lot of really nice sorority girls during my time in school — but they were always communications, PR, english, IR or PolSci majors. Those are low-unit, low-intensity majors that, if I had been in, I could have graduated with a 4.0 instead of a 3.0, too.
“How many sorority girls do you know who are engineering, art (include creative writing), biology, math or music (singing doesn’t count!) majors?”
Many actually (and yes, in “real” sororities), most of whom have GPAs above 3.5 (gasp!). Either you aren’t in one of those majors or don’t talk to many people who are in your classes.
your not in a real sorority so dont speak for us
This is a pretty positive article about sorority life that shoots down horrible stereotypes…and you’re offended by it? Does this mean you actually ARE a dumb blonde who’s here to do nothing more than party? “Don’t speak for us! I AM here to party!! wooo!” 
I wish more sororities were like the one this writer is a member of and I wish more were like her, i.e. not crazy bimbos. You go, Gao. 
And you, anon, get outta here.
@ seriously?, you are so right!!! It’s sad that anon is so negative and according to anon the only greeks are NPC/IFC. 
I REALLY want to point out one great thing to anon. It’s “you’re” not “your.” “Your” is possessive. “You’re” means “you are.” Please get your basic spelling and grammar correct if you are going to criticize Way to keep the stereotypes alive!
oooo, correcting the spelling and grammar of comments on some internet site. 
this page and discourse has degenerated quickly.
I really don’t care about any of this, but seeing somebody correct someone else’s grammar online amuses me – especially when the corrector lacks perfect grammar themselves.
anon @ March 27 4:47PM
Yes, we could tell. You put ‘your’ rather than ‘you’re’, which kind of gave you away.
[…] The Daily Trojan later cleared up that the email did not originate from within Kappa […]

From Al Qaeda to the cast of Jersey Shore, who or what people believe to be America’s biggest enemy varies significantly from person to person.
Odds are good, though, that few will point the blame at the same mortal foe then-Presidential candidate Ronald Reagan identified in 1980: inflation. Reagan zeroed in on inflation and sought to, in no uncertain terms, kill it. To his credit, Reagan greatly succeeded in slowing the pace of inflation.
Now, with oil prices spiking, economic experts including Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke have expressed concern about potentially rising inflation. Bernanke said, however, a rise in oil prices would merely lead to a “temporary and relatively modest” increase in consumer price inflation.
If Bernanke came shopping for groceries with me, I suspect he’d change his tune.
Before spring break, a loaf of fresh-baked bread at Ralph’s cost $1.47; that price has since risen to $1.77.  Packaged deli meat, previously $3.99, is now $4.49.  A 20 percent and 13 percent rise, respectively, in the cost of weekly food staples is more than a “relatively modest” increase in consumer price inflation.
This is a national problem, as evidenced by the fact that U.S. food production costs are 4 percent higher  now than in 2010.
The good news is that only a few staples are more expensive, just as the growing costs of production have not caused major restaurants or bars to raise prices. No one should get bent out of shape until prices at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center suddenly rise 15 percent.
If there were just one adversary of the United States today, however, it would most certainly be inflation, given its full potential to stymie the country’s fragile economic recovery. Inflation also hits those dependent upon fixed income — like college students relying on their student loans — particularly hard, greatly eroding spending power.
Ultimately, though inflation is, at present, merely “higher-than-desirable,”  a trip to your local grocery store will give you a taste of what lies in wait should America’s mortal enemy — inflation — not be tamed.

Classic movie buffs, it is time to get your popcorn out because your wildest black-and-white colored dreams are coming true.  No, James Dean and Marilyn Monroe have not come back from the dead, but rumor has it that three classic movies are in the remake process (well technically  two remakes and one prequel).
Oz, the Great and Powerful: Before Dorothy and Toto mistakenly discovered the Land of Oz in the iconic The Wizard of Oz, there were Mila Kunis and James Franco ruling the Emerald City. Kunis recently signed on to play one of the three witches along with Franco, a fast-talking snake oil salesman and illusionist, in Disney’s prequel to the 1939 film.
According to Variety, Kunis will play Theodora, “a good witch, alongside her beautiful sister Glinda, but after her sexual advances are jilted by Franco’s salesman, she’s convinced by Evanora to switch sides and help her older sister rule Oz.”
Three Stooges:  The slapstick comedic trio was originally set up with MGM but the Farrelly brothers’ (Bobby Farrelly and Peter Farrelly) film has since changed to 20th Century Fox.  Will Sasso ($#*! My Dad Says) was officially cast to play the first of the three stooges, Curly Howard.  While the movie is not a biography of the original three brothers, according to The Hollywood Reporter it will be “divided into three vignettes telling an overall story.”
Any suggestions for who should play Moe or Shemp?
The Thin Man:  Although the comedic mystery had five sequels, so far for Warner Bros. there is only one. Jerry Stahl (Permanent Midnight) will be writing the screenplay and Johnny Depp will star.
Johnny Depp seems to be the perfect fit for Nick Charles, a witty and brilliant drunk, who is persuaded to return to his private detective days by his beautiful and rich wife Nora and their schnauzer Asta.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the studio hopes to give the film a “contemporary attitude but retain the period setting.”
Will these films be able to live up to their predecessors?   Or are the classics untouchable?
