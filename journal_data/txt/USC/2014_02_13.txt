InterVarsity Trojan Christian Fellowship and World Vision ACT:S assembled 100 supply kits for those affected by HIV/AIDS in Swaziland Thursday night during IVTCF’s weekly Encounter meeting. The event was funded by the Undergraduate Student Government’s Philanthropy Funding Board.
IVTCF holds weekly open Encounter meetings, which have recently focused on social justice through a series called “Breakthrough.”
“[Christian faith and social justice] are deeply intertwined,” said sophomore neuroscience major Ifeyinwa Anene. “You can’t be Christian without seeing injustice and doing something about it.”
On Thursday night, Encounter attendees “did something about it.” Attendees assembled kits of basic supplies intended to improve and prolong the lives of those living with HIV/AIDS as well as to prevent the spread of infection. The kits included rubber gloves, soap, medical tape and individually handwritten notes.
All the regular Encounter attendees were encouraged to participate actively in the project.
“It’s pretty cool because a lot of the time at church it just ends up being, ‘You should make kits,’ or, ‘Bring the kits you make here,’ but [at IVTCF] it’s up close and personal,” said Jeffrey Wang, a freshman majoring in biological sciences. “There’s not a connotation of participation being optional,” Wang said.
The kits will be donated to international Christian nonprofit World Vision. World Vision has sent more than 77,000 volunteer caregivers to Africa, Asia and Latin America to provide       home-based comfort and care for victims of HIV/AIDS and other serious health conditions. The kits created Thursday night will go directly to volunteer caregivers in Swaziland. Swaziland has the highest rate of HIV/AIDS in the world.
“The event is really about equipping caregivers in Swaziland, Africa with proper resources and encouragement,” said Adam Joe, a junior majoring in  film production major and co-president of World Vision ACT:S, said. “What’s really cool about this event is that students can tangibly help AIDS patients.”
World Vision is the parent organization for World Vision ACT:S, which was founded at USC last year by current juniors Adam Joe and Michelle Lau. Now, World Vision ACT:S is a branch of IVTCF’s social ministries branch, and also recently became part of the Political Student Assembly within Program Board. World Vision ACT:S is dedicated to creative activism, with the mission to “create to inspire action.”
“For me, it’s more of a direct impact we can have on big systemic issues like HIV/AIDS,” said Neriah Yue, acting president of IVTCF.
World Vision ACT:S, which advocates in the issue areas of human trafficking and urban poverty as well as HIV/AIDS, has plans to expand its social justice campaign campus-wide. World Vision ACT:S is collaborating with nonprofit iEmpathize and other student organizations to hold an Empathy Week on campus in March.
“As a Christian, I think justice is part of our faith,” Joe said. “In the Bible, we see a theme of justice from beginning to end.”

Students and community members gathered Thursday evening for a panel discussion focusing on empowering the Asian American youth community after a copy of a racist flier was sent to USC Asian Pacific American Student Services and UCLA’s Asian American Studies Center. The event was co-sponsored by the Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment, and the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly.
The panel was made up of Asian American activists and community organizers including Nat Lowe from Asian Americans Advancing Justice; Tracy Zhao, a graduate of Pomona College and a research associate at UCLA, and Andrew Quan from the organization Liberty in North Korea. The panel shared their experiences and gave advice to students on how to mobilize their community to accomplish change before the event moved into an open discussion on issues of race on campus.
“When I saw the flier, I was like, ‘Wow, that’s really horrible,’ but we’re all here talking about these issues,” Lowe said.
The panelists warned against letting emotion influence the response, and said it was important to use this as an opportunity to educate the community about the issues.
“It’s easy to get angry about issues, [but] we can’t think about our policies and actions as reactionary, you have to think about what you want to see, what is your vision for your future and your community. It might not feel like activism but you’re enabling people to keep doing what they’re doing,” Zhao said.
Quan said it was important to use these experiences to motivate people to get engaged in the cause.
“You need to start with the why, the temptation is to just start telling people what to do, but the why is the most important, sharing facts and statistics, or personal stories,” Quan said. “Build on top of the emotional energy with knowledge.”
All the panelists urged students to engage with the issues and not to leave them to students in leadership roles or the administration.
“In a social justice context, when I think about leadership I think about a commitment to social justice,” Lowe said. “The conventional thought about leadership is you have to have certain qualities, communicate in certain ways, but anyone can have [that commitment.,”
The event then shifted toward a discussion on the recent controversy surrounding fliers distributed on UCLA’s campus and sent to USC APASS. Both APASS and APASA issued official responses to the letter, both of which can be found online. Both said they were careful in crafting their response so as not to avoid giving the perpetrator undue publicity.
“This is something that is new to us,” director of APASS Mary Ho said. “It’s not about APASS, it’s what it means to the students — what we chose to do. It was a chance to empower students, and to have them frame what social justice means to them, and have them make history at USC.”
APASA and USC SCAPE coordinated a response that was co-signed by student groups around campusand around the country, including the Asian Pacific American Coalition at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign.
“Let’s retool this as a learning tool, use it to educate and empower,” said Jonathan Wang, assistant director of APASS. “It doesn’t matter who the author was, it was meant to drive us apart.”
The administration, has not made an official statement, but Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry was present to gauge student response.
“We have to [strike] a really important balance here: We don’t want to give the perpetrator any advertising; we don’t want the flyer to receive the attraction of the university promoting it,” Carry said. “We’ve been coordinating a response. We thought the APASS response and the student response was perfect, and we didn’t want to trump that response.”
He said that he and the administration were taking the issue very seriously.
“As a person of color, I imagined all those terminologies being used against me, and the people I care about, and at USC we do not tolerate that language. This is a community that values its diversity — it is our number one asset,” Carry said.
He invoked Martin Luther King Jr.’s famous words: “An injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.”
“This has an impact on our entire institution,” Carry said. “We are standing together to make sure this is not tolerated on our campus; it is deplorable.”
He further urged students to engage in dialogue across cultural boundaries so as not to have a “siloed” approach to the problem.
“Imagine how our response would be if we were all equally offended by this,” Carry said. “When any part of our community is challenged, we should all feel challenged; this problem is so big we can’t expect one culture to deal with it. Our approach needs to be cross-cultural.”
When asked how students should engage with administrators, Lily Chowana-Bandu, interim director of Campus Activities, urged students to utilize their available resources.
“We all support your cause; we were all appalled,” she said. “This is not a part of your USC or UCLA experience — you should have an opportunity to learn where it’s safe, supportive and fun. If you want to talk to any administrator, they will bring it up the chain. We want to be supportive. You are supported in any avenue.”
Representatives from El Centro Chicano attended the forum and voiced their support for the cause, saying that it was an issue that affected all minority students in the community.
Rayven Vinson, a senior majoring in international relations and Spanish, said the hidden identity of the flier’s author created a sense of mistrust within the student community.
“It creates that fear that you’re in a community where there are members who are targeting a group that you are a part of,” Vinson said. “These are people you see every day.”
Other students said addressing the problem required becoming more accepting as a community.
“We as a society need to become more accepting and open to interacting with different people, like international students,” said Jacky Chen, a sophomore majoring in engineering.
Why doesn’t this article address what the topic of racism was? I already know, because I read about it in the LA Times. I bet the perpetrator is an angry, pent-up angry, Asian male who’s livid that some Asian females CHOOSE to date and SLEEP with white males. Too bad, so sad. It’s the meek Asian male’s fault. This is a call for a cultural change. No more filial piety; no more “I don’t make aggressive advances towards girls because ‘I respect them’ copout.”

A survey conducted by the Council for Aid to Education’s Voluntary Support of Education reported that USC ranked third in highest financial contributions from donors last year.
In 2013, USC received a total of $674.5 million in donations, behind Stanford University and Harvard University, who were ranked first and second, respectively. The survey also found that overall university philanthropy is increasing slowly since a dip after the 2008 recession.
According to the Council for Aid to Education’s website, the Voluntary Support of Education survey “is the authoritative national source of data on charitable giving to higher education and private K-12 institutions.”
USC Senior Vice President of Finance Robert Abeles commented on the prestige of being ranked among schools with long histories of receiving large financial gifts.
“To be ranked in fundraising alongside universities such as Stanford and Harvard is a wonderful tribute to the generosity of our alumni, parents, grandparents and others who support our commitment to becoming one of the world’s great institutions of higher learning,” Abeles said.
USC Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett commented on the successful fundraising efforts of USC President C. L. Max Nikias.
“Traditionally, people thought the Ivy League is the giant donors,” Garrett said. “We’ve seen USC rising in the ranks, though. In this respect, the president’s audacious fundraiser campaign has been more successful than any of us have expected. It’s a very credible kind of success,” Garrett said.
Garrett also commented on how the generosity of donors will greatly benefit student scholarship funds.
“What makes me particularly excited is that the fundraising efforts are for academics,” Garrett said. “We will be increasing student scholarships, and much of the money has been allocated for academic priority.”
The  provost said the fundraising efforts have culminated in a variety of donations.
“We’ve had, in this campaign, more than 200,000 individual donations. Quite a bit of fundraising comes from parents of students, and happy parents means happy students,” Garrett said.
Many USC students had similarly positive responses regarding the generosity of alumni and other donors, though they had differing views on how the contributions should be allocated throughout the university.
Sarkis Ekmekian, a junior majoring in communication, commented on the Trojan Family’s generous contribution to the upcoming Wallis Annenberg Hall building.
“I think it’s amazing and it shows how dedicated the Trojan Family is and how much people appreciate what USC has done for them,” Ekmekian said. “I’m positive the school will utilize all these funds to provide more amazing resources for us, such as the new Annenberg building, which I am extremely excited about.”
Shayna Lurey, a sophomore majoring in business administration, hopes to see more funds distributed to student scholarship funds.
“I think it’s great that USC has the ability to improve our campus and provide scholarships to so many Trojans,” Lurey said. “Hopefully, the generosity of our alumni will contribute to even more scholarship opportunities for students in need.”
Adam Syed, a junior majoring in psychology, similarly wants to see the contributions go toward academic scholarships for students.
“I think that’s good; I just hope a portion of the money goes toward financial aid and scholarship funds because a lot of students need financial help,” Syed said.

The Los Angeles Fire Department and USC officials gathered at McAllister Field Thursday afternoon to celebrate the groundbreaking of USC Fire Station No. 15.
Holes · USC and Los Angeles administrative leaders gather at McAllister Field to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Those present at the event included President C. L. Max Nikias, City Attorney Mike Feuer, Councilmember of the 9th District Curren Price and Interim Fire Chief of the Los Angeles Fire Department James G. Featherstone. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was scheduled to attend but could not make it due to an emergency conflict regarding the state drought.
The new Fire Station No. 15, which is set to replace the current station situated on Jefferson Boulevard, will be located on the corner of Hoover Street and 30th Street.
Fire Station 15 opened its doors in 1900 and moved to its current location on Jefferson in 1950, Featherstone said. On average, the station responds to approximately 14 emergency calls per day, totaling around 5,120 emergencies in the past year. In order to keep up with the emergencies in the area, the new facilities will be situated on an acre of land.
The new fire station is funded by USC, which annually invests $32 million in the surrounding community.
“This mutual commitment to our neighborhood is not a job — it is our calling,” Nikias said.
The university’s donation allowed the new station to move forward with its improvements after delays due to lack of funding.
Price noted the project works toward helping both USC and the surrounding neighborhood.
“We’re celebrating the inauguration, the creation and development of a community resource; a resource that’s going to serve not only the university but also the community at large,” Price said.
City officials, including Feuer, were grateful for USC’s contributions toward emergency response services.
“A little over a year ago, I was on my way to the swearing in of our newest district attorney, and a very big vehicle ran a red light and ran into my very small vehicle,” Feuer said. “I’m extremely fortunate to be here at all … I was on the receiving end of the service from these paramedics. They’re very serious about their job.”
 
So what’s going to happen to McAllister field? Will soccer and other events still be held there or will the FD take over the whole spot? What portion of the field is the new building going to take over?
McAlister Field will remain as currently configured. The field and stands were repositioned I believe last year in preparation for the station site which occupies just the corner / wedge between the apartment building to the south and 30th to the north.
Boy can they spin it! 
The truth is that the University Village project could not move forward until the fire station was relocated.
“The new fire station is funded by USC, which annually invests $32 million in the surrounding community. “This mutual commitment to our neighborhood is not a job — it is our calling,” Nikias said. The university’s donation allowed the new station to move forward with its improvements after delays due to lack of funding”. –
Will this affect my weekly “transport” from the row to the hospital?
“This mutual commitment to our neighborhood is not a job — it is our calling,”
No, like all non-profit universities, USC doesn’t pay a dime in property taxes to the city.  Some would argue that paying property taxes in exchange for city services is in fact an obligation.
How long will construction take? When will the new station open? Is this station move in preparation for the new Village construction?

Downtown Los Angeles became a thrift shopper’s paradise on Sunday as vintage collectors and admirers gathered together for the Los Angeles Vintage Fashion Expo. 
The expo took place inside the Los Angeles Convention Center from Feb. 7-9. Attendees had the opportunity to shop from more than 50 vintage fashion dealers and exhibitors from across the country. Many of the dealers were L.A.-based and took the opportunity to showcase their local merchandise to a larger audience. 
Vintage fashion has always carried two distinct connotations: it is either someone’s old clothing or a unique piece of history that offers a glimpse into a different era. For the expo attendees, vintage takes on the latter definition as something to be treasured and valued. 
Whitney Peterson, owner of Etsy shop Let Them Eat Cake, pointed out the quality of vintage clothes that allows them to be wearable decade after decade. 
“Vintage in general was made better; a lot of it was made by hand with a lot more care and better fabrics,” Peterson said. 
There is a clear distinction between the mass market apparel found in stores today and the rare items showcased at the fashion expo. Some of the items on the display were one of a kind and anyone would be hard-pressed to find an exact replica of an item. It is not every day that one sees a hand-sewn beaded dress covered in crystals from the neck down to the arms. 
There was a wide variety of styles to choose from to suit everyone’s taste. Though some booths looked like replicas of Lucille Ball’s closet, others were bursting with enough sparkles and feathers for a Gatsby party. There were even boutiques that catered to men, complete with top hats and canes. Prices ranged from $10 for a well-loved brooch to up to $2200 for an ivory and peach embroidered Narciso Rodriguez satin trench coat. Many of the clothes were brandless and without tags, making a trip to the large communal dressing room a necessary addition to the treasure hunt. Hidden among the unknown, however, were well-known designer pieces from such designers as Valentino and Chanel. 
Many of the visitors had no inclination to shop but rather attended to marvel at the intricate designs and revel in the artistry to perhaps find something they could incorporate in their own wardrobes. 
“There is nothing better and more inspiring than the art and the color and the styles of yesterday to color today, which can so often be so bland,” said Stacia Martin, an avid vintage shopper who frequents many vintage fairs.
There was no shortage of inspiration at the expo, with some pieces clearly showing their age and were more suited for collections than the closet. Vintage dealer Jermel Nakia, however, explained how versatile most vintage items can be. 
“I feel like people should reinvent. You can do one piece that’s Lucille Ball-esque and modernize with a purse and shoes from today,” Nakia said. 
The Vintage Fashion Expo has been bringing together the country’s top vintage dealers for almost 30 years. The event was founded by five vintage dealers in 1987 with the purpose of creating a space where the finest in vintage design, style and period pieces could be found. 
“The goals of the expo are and always have been to bring together the country’s best vintage fashion dealers with the customer who collects or integrates quality vintage garments into their wardrobe, resulting in a good investment or personal killer style,” said Margaret Schell, director of marketing and communications for the Vintage Fashion Expo. 
The expo takes place five times yearly in Los Angeles and San Francisco. This year, the Vintage Fashion Expo also partnered with Inspiration LA as a collaborative effort to create Vintage Weekend LA 2014. In total, more than 150 vintage fashion dealers showcased their collections to the public. Perhaps many of the dealers shared Nakia’s intentions with vintage dressing. 
“All my pieces are about [being a] lady,” Nakia said. “I’m trying to bring back being chic and sophisticated and not having to expose any kind of skin and still be sexy.”
Something to remember: Audrey Hepburn and Lucille Ball never had to get naked or expose too much to be considered iconic. Here’s looking at you, Miley.

Earlier this week, Michael Sam Sr., the father of gay NFL prospect Michael Sam, aired his concerns to the national media that his son would be incapable of providing his future grandchildren with a traditional family environment to grow up in.
After Sam Sr. received a text message from his son simply stating, “Dad, I’m gay,” he reportedly had a hard time digesting the news.
“I couldn’t eat no more, so I went to Applebee’s to have drinks,” Sam Sr. told The New York Times. “I don’t want my grandkids raised in that kind of environment.”
Oh, the irony.
That’s right — the man who aired a deeply controversial reaction to his son’s sexual orientation to the most-read newspaper in the world is concerned about someone else’s ability to provide a loving family environment.
He even went as far to say that late Hall of Fame defensive lineman Deacon Jones is “turning over in his grave.”
As a journalist, I am usually thankful when people give non-cookie cutter quotes — but I would never wish something like this upon anyone.
People have mostly had one of two reactions to Sam Sr.’s feelings — one camp is shocked that these emotions were disclosed to the press, the other is sympathetic to Sam Sr.’s reaction due to the seemingly casual manner in which he was informed of his son’s sexual orientation.
I must admit, at first I was surprised at Sam’s decision to inform his father of his orientation through a text message. But the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. Sam has known his father far longer than any of the bloggers questioning that fateful text message. He probably had an inkling of what his father’s reaction would be (losing his appetite and going to get drunk), and didn’t want to hear it with his own ears. I can hardly blame him for waiting to tell his father long after his friends, waiting until the last possible moment before his personal life became international news. It might not have been the right decision, if he didn’t want his father to express his knee-jerk reaction to The New York Times. But who could ever anticipate a parents doing that?
Sam Sr. has since told the Galveston County Daily News that he was radically misquoted by the Times, saying, “[Sam] has made a great statement in coming out, and he should be able to play in the NFL. I love him unconditionally.”
I would honestly love to believe that Sam Sr. was indeed drastically misquoted, and I am certainly not writing this to argue that he doesn’t love his son. But Sam’s relationship with his father obviously isn’t as simple as we’d all like it to be — Sam Jr.  also told the Times that he stays with his friends rather than his family when he returns home to Hitchcock, Tex.
Everyone has had to admit things to their parents that they’d rather not. But it’s shocking to see the disparity between Sam’s seemingly nonchalant demeanor in interviews with ESPN and the Times, in which he said coming out to the world was “nothing” compared to the hardships he endured as a child and the far less direct approach he took in disclosing his orientation to his father.
The tragedies the Sam family has endured makes Sam Sr.’s reaction even more cringe-worthy. Considering that according to the Times two of his children are dead, two more are in jail and another went missing as a child, shouldn’t he be more accepting of his remaining son?
Many have speculated that Sam chose to text his father because he was nervous about what he’d hear on the other end of the line. But maybe that’s not it at all.
Maybe he felt his father only deserved a text. Maybe he wanted to keep him at an arm’s length. Maybe that’s why he forgoes staying with him on trips back to his hometown. Maybe he wanted to keep him informed on a need-to-know basis before the word got to him through the media.
From now on, Sam Sr. might not even deserve that courtesy.

This weekend, the No. 3 Trojans (4-0) will head into the Texas heat for this year’s ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Houston, with their first match coming today at 3 p.m. against No. 14 Tennessee.

Around this time last year, USC’s men’s tennis team experienced its first loss of the 2013 season against No. 1 Virginia in the championship match of last year’s tournament in Seattle. The team hopes that its luck will be different this time around.
After last weekend’s showdown with Stanford was cancelled due to rain, the Trojans will enter the first game of the tournament after an almost two-weeks off. Still, USC head coach Peter Smith believes the time off has prepared them well going forward.
“This game is bigger than Stanford, so we’re ready to go,” Smith said. “The team’s in a great place. [Now] the season is really starting.”
Though the Trojans are ranked 11 spots ahead of Tennessee, the Volunteers are worthy opponents having qualified for the ITA National Indoors for the last six seasons. Tennessee’s talent has impressed Smith.
“The guys were already sizing each other up,” Smith said. “[We are] ready for a chance to see all the other teams and feel the intensity of the tournament.”
In regards to the tournament as a whole, however, both Smith and senior captain Ray Sarmiento aren’t looking any farther than round one.
“[I’m taking it] one match at a time,” Sarmiento said. [I will] take care of each game and practice … [and] the results will come.”
Sarmiento has been stellar so far this season, not dropping a single set in singles play. He and doubles partner junior Yannick Hanfmann have also delivered at the top spot so far this season, and recently jumped to the No. 35 ranking in the country together. Smith, when asked about Sarmiento, focused on his growth and leadership position.
“We just need him to lead the team, with his head and his heart,” Smith said.
Sarmiento is ranked No. 7 in the nation in singles, and is joined on the national rankings list by Hanfmann at No. 16 and junior Jonny Wang at No. 47. Despite outstanding performances in singles and doubles play so far this season, junior Roberto Quiroz fell out of the latest rankings.
The Trojans earned a No. 4 preseason ranking, but after sweeping then-No. 3 Georgia in the Pac-12/SEC Showdown, USC moved up to the third spot in the country. But the team and coaching staff consistently downplay these rankings.
“The program is used to being No. 1,” Smith said. “[We] don’t get excited about No. 3. [I am] excited about how good [the team is] and how tough they are.”
With this weekend’s tournament being played indoors, there are a number of new conditions to which the team will have to adjust. There are no indoor tennis courts near campus for the Trojans to practice on, so the team has had to simulate indoor conditions as best as they could — even going as far as to practice with sunglasses on.
The environment might be different, but the Trojans think it could still be beneficial.
“Playing indoors really adds to the excitement,” Sarmiento said. “You get to play like this once a year, and it’s definitely different. There’s a different feel, a different type of game, and you just do your best with the courts. I think we have a really good indoor team.”
Another adjustment the Trojans have had to deal with is the experimental scoring system college tennis teams have been using for the last two months. As always, teams will be vying for four team points, but the match scoring is slightly different. The three doubles matches to start the contest will be played as six-game sets, instead of eight-game sets. Matches will feature no-ad scoring and a tiebreakers if tied at 5-5. Six singles matches will then be played, each worth one team point. Matches will be best-of-three sets with no-ad scoring. Rules will return to NCAA format after this tournament.
A first-round win over the Volunteers this afternoon would take the Trojans to a Saturday quarterfinal matchup against either No. 6 Baylor or No. 11 Texas A&M. If the Trojans advance further, the semifinals are set for Sunday, and the championship match will take place at noon on Monday.

After running over crosstown rival UCLA to complete a season sweep, the Women of Troy look to continue to build momentum as they get back on the road this weekend to take on the Oregon schools.
Duck hunt · Senior forward Cassie Harberts knows that Oregon did not play its best game at the Galen Center on Jan. 19, and thinks the Ducks will provide a big challenge tonight. Harberts is averaging 16.4 points per game. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC (15-9, 8-4 Pac-12) will first travel to Eugene, Ore. to take on the Ducks tonight before heading to Corvallis, Ore. to face off against the Beavers on Sunday.
The Women of Troy prevailed against both squads in earlier matches at the Galen Center this season and will be looking to sweep another pair of Pac-12 schools. USC defeated Oregon State 81-60 and Oregon 109-85 in late January.
The win against Oregon marked USC’s season-high for points scored in a game.
“When they were here, they didn’t shoot too well so we are going to go up there with the mentality that they are going to shoot really well on their home court,” said senior forward Cassie Harberts. “We have to rebound the ball, play defense and play our game.”
Harberts heads into the weekend leading the team in scoring, averaging 16.4 points per game, while junior guard Ariya Crook is scoring 15.7 points a game.
USC head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke has been an advocate of intensity on the defensive side of the ball, but the team has also been working on improving its offense.
“One of things we have been focusing [on] in practice has been sharing the ball, the correct spacing and timing offensively,” Cooper-Dyke said.
The Women of Troy are looking to get back on a roll after they snapped their three-game losing streak last Saturday in a 68-54 win over the Bruins.
“It was very important [for us] before we got out on the road to get back up on that winning horse,” Cooper-Dyke said.
The team still remains in the top tier of the conference, as it has throughout the conference schedule. No. 6 Stanford, No. 22 California and Arizona State are the only three teams that stand ahead of USC in the conference.
Even with their success this year both inside and outside the Pac-12, the Women of Troy have been unable to crack the national top 25 as they enter their 15th week of competition, though they have received votes in the earlier weeks.
Oregon State (15-9, 7-5) comes into the matchup one game behind USC in the Pac-12 standings.
In their Friday tilt with the Beavers, the Women of Troy should expect a confident Oregon State team that is coming off three wins in a row against Arizona, Colorado and Utah.
Jamie Weisner is the Beavers’ leading scorer, averaging 13.8 points per game. Teammate Sydney Weise is just behind her, averaging 13.4 points per game.
The Ducks (13-10, 4-8) have not defeated the Women of Troy since 2010 and are coming off a 93-71 win against Utah and a 81-75 loss to the Buffs.
Oregon’s Chrishae Rowe has asserted her dominance as the squad’s leading scorer, averaging an impressive 23 points per game. The tandem of Rowe and Jillian Alleyne, who is second on the team in scoring with 21.1 points per game, could prove to be a challenge for USC’s defense. Alleyne also brings down a team-high 15.3 rebounds per game, to average a double-double.
This road trip is especially important for the Women of Troy, as the following week they will return home to the Galen Center to host two of the Pac-12’s best teams in Stanford and the nationally ranked Cal Golden Bears. But USC’s head coach is reluctant to look too far into the future.
“We are going to continue to take it game by game,” Cooper-Dyke said.

It’s called studying abroad for a reason. You’re supposed to study. I mean, it’s in the name.
Yet for some reason, the whole studying aspect of the semester is often the most commonly overlooked when it comes to an evaluation of the experience. It’s not too hard to figure out why, either. It’s pretty difficult to concentrate in a classroom when a brand new city awaits you outside.
I came to London prepared to work moderately hard in school, only I expected it to be infinitely easier without all the extracurriculars, jobs and internships that bog down my schedule at USC.
What I wasn’t prepared for was how little I would care.
I know I just said the thing you aren’t supposed to say, but if we’re being honest, it’s amazing how quickly years of good study habits disappeared when I arrived here. It’s almost like a switch flipped as soon as finals ended in December but never turned back on in January. And in a new place, a lack of effort in the classroom usually translates into a lack of involvement in the university as well.
Simply attending a foreign university, however, often feels like enough of an education, and grasping an entirely new higher education system in a matter of weeks is no small feat. At least in the U.K., college typically lasts for three years, during which classes are held once per week, and there is an expectation of a significant amount of independent study. Our pre-trip orientation session at USC taught us that grades here are usually based on one essay or exam and earning an A in a class is uncommon, which is why my specific program is based on a pass/fail grading system.
Don’t think we weren’t warned about the potential consequences of neglecting our studies. Our orientation also had more than its share of urban legends about students who slacked off abroad only to face the backlash of failing a class after they returned home.
“People who failed classes during their semester abroad have had to stay an extra semester at USC,” our advisers cautioned. It’s the stuff of nightmares.
I think the main issue here is that everyone studying abroad is constantly reminded that their stay at his or her respective university is temporary — my plane ticket home was booked before I even left. The institution we attend for a whopping four to six months will not appear on our diplomas or even on our transcripts. It’s just a blip on the radar.
Also, the classes students take abroad do not necessarily mesh well with their course of study back home. Even if they are taking the same subject as they would in the United States, the teaching and evaluation styles might be even more shockingly new than the content of the lectures. The only aspect of classes that I do find to be valuable is the discussion sections, or “seminars” as they are known here, because we actually get to talk to British students and learn about their lives. Other than that, it doesn’t make sense to invest oneself in something so fleeting as a pass/fail class unrelated to your major in a foreign country.
Aside from class itself, my university encourages people in my program to join student organizations. Maybe I’m biased because the school is not particularly residential and barely has a campus, but according to my recently developed formula, the type of program you’re in divided by the type of college you attend equals how much you will interact with said college. I’m in a 10-person program with students in my major who I’ve known for the past two years. City University doesn’t have a particularly vibrant student life. Thus, my involvement is inappreciable.
As my third week of classes in London comes to a close, I sort of wish this whole lack-of-studying-while-abroad thing was different. Countless people have told me that this experience is not and should not be about academic learning. To an extent, I agree. This is a unique opportunity to immerse ourselves in a different country with virtually zero responsibility, which is much more fun than staring at PowerPoint slides.
That mindset, however, can also hinder us from becoming acquainted with our counterparts overseas. We put so much effort trying to make the most of this trip, to see every sight and go to every country that we miss out on discovering what it’s like for students to actually live here. We’ve been here a month, but we’re still far from being anything more than tourists. If study abroad was more about studying, we would get a true taste of life in a different country and probably start to feel a little more at home ourselves.
I have to admit that as I sit wearily in my 10 a.m. lectures, absently gazing at my notebook pretending to listen, I sometimes catch a snippet of my professor’s statement about something interesting, and for a second I really think about engaging myself in the discussion at hand.
I really think about it.

In a dystopian future where robots overwhelm mankind, technology is left to rule Earth as it pleases. But a small fragment of hope lies in the Earth’s greatest gift: nature. Underneath a junkyard of stacked dirt and metallic cubicle waste hides the hero of the story. Interestingly, the hero is not a big and powerful human or animal, but a lone, small seedling named Sprout. Using the powers of nature, players control Sprout in order to defeat the robotic menace that has taken over the world. Against unspeakable danger and mighty metal foes, Sprout begins a lively journey toward the Tree of Life in order to restore the world to its natural state.
No doubt, sprout · Bloom players travel through levels as a small green sprout. This game will be available to test at Demo Day on May 14th. – Photos courtesy of Jordan Klein
 
Bloom is a 2.5D adventure platform game led by a large group of hardworking Trojans. So far, the team has released a demo on its website that contains two levels and a Boss Battle. Players engage in a cel-shaded cartoon world through Sprout, who has the ability to shift its powers depending on the flowers that it comes across. Gameplay is very simple; players control Sprout using the WASD keys, the spacebar and a mouse along two axes of movement: up, down, left and right. While navigating Sprout toward an unknown destination, players can watch as the background unfolds a story illustrating the sheer might of machines. Though the playable demo on the iPad requires more work, the Bloom team is working hard to perfect its demonstrations in time for the Game Developers Convention in San Francisco in March.
Developed by a team of nearly sixty people, Bloom shows promise with eye catching visuals, and an expansive team of talented students. Understandably, a team as large as this one is prone to run into some kind of difficulty. Initially the team faced an array of problems from an inexperienced art team to organizational difficulties. At the same time, scheduling and communication is still a rampant problem which was exemplified by yesterday’s rushed interview. Both are minor issues that could be solved very easily as the team has previously fixed bigger problems in the past.
“We had two major hits this year,” said networking lead Christopher Barakian. “Two of our previous leads left.” The abrupt departure of important members forced the remaining students to step up and fill in to keep the project running. Most of the positions are filled by those who have chosen to take on the job even if the position is different than what they’re used to. This allows for other members to easily pick up where others have left off, creating an efficient team dynamic.
At the same time, the team increased its network of talented individuals through outreach to students at other schools. As it outsourced certain jobs to different people, the team smoothed out its rough patches. Ultimately, the group formed a team to collaborate on possibly the biggest student game of the year.
“It’s amazing to have all these people come together to work on one big project,” said lead producer Jordan Klein. “It’s a great learning experience.” Jordan said the average size of a development team is only 25 people. But with a team as large as Bloom’s, it isn’t easy for morale and dedication to stay high. Fortunately, Bloom’s team is diverse and dedicated. The team dynamic parallels Sprout itself in that the different talents of each individual contribute to the overall strength of the whole, allowing the team to overcome difficult hurdles.
“We even have an amazing musical score, composed by Max Loh, a graduate of USC’s “Scoring for Motion Pictures and Television” program,” said lead engineer Peter Turner. Not only does this student project have the expertise and talent of sixty people, but they also have support in the form of platform kits from Sony.
USC currently ranks as the nation’s top school in computer science games, so it’s not surprising to see Bloom’s level of quality and originality. Indeed, the game has come a long way after only a few months of production. The USC Advanced Games program itself is a yearlong period in which students of various majors gather to create digital games.
For aspiring students interested in creating their very own game, pitches for next year’s projects are due in a couple of months and this team encourages students of all majors to voice their opinions.
“Always hold yourself to higher standards,” says game director Khaled Abdel Rahman. The team’s relentless hard work and promotion has led them from a scattered collection of individuals with a single artistic goal to a development team who may see their vision come to fruition. But for Bloom to be an even bigger success in the future, it should focus on improving its internal organization. The game shows promise but could benefit more from improved communication and scheduling abilities.
Supporters can continue to support future USC student projects by attending Demo Day on May 14 to playtest Bloom as well as other promising student-produced games.

Fifty million downloads and months of frustration later, Vietnamese game designer Dong Nguyen pulled the plug on his popular Flappy Bird application, according to Slate. Though many attribute the mania behind the game as enough reason for it to go, the fact of the matter is that this isn’t about Flappy Bird — it’s about the fanatic culture surrounding society’s relationship to these smartphone games.
Christina Ellis and Matthew Torres | Daily Trojan
 
Dubbed the world’s most downloaded game, the once-available Flappy Bird garnered $50,000 per day in profits. It didn’t start off that way. Launched in May, the game didn’t reach peak popularity until January, when it secured its spot as the most downloaded application in the App Store. In fact, the game itself wasn’t considered to be particularly good, receiving a measly 52/100 from critics on the game review site Metacritic. This is not to say, however, that the game somehow improved dramatically to earn its spot on the App Store hall of fame. Rather, the game’s popularity stemmed from a much simpler reality that had nothing to do with the quality of the game — the societal hype that surrounds the maddening frustration of simple game fads.
Though the game has been portrayed by many as a genius creation, this isn’t the first time that society has become obsessed with a frustratingly competitive app. The appeal that drew 50 million users to use Flappy Bird is the same that compelled millions to download other addictive games such as Angry Birds, Candy Crush and Temple Run — they’re all games that are simple to learn, yet impossible to win. If anything, it’s not the success one achieves while playing such games, but the shared struggle one enjoys while playing that makes them so addictive. Not only do these games allow for individuals to compete against each other for hard-fought best scores, but they also allow everyone to share in a communal struggle against an ultimately impossible task.
The shared culture and hysteria wasn’t just limited to the game — it also found its way to social media. Twitter accounts dedicated to “Flappy Bird Problems” gained 144,000 followers. Someone even took to BuzzFeed to create “The 21 Stages of Having Your Life Completely Ruined By Flappy Bird” page.
When news of Flappy Bird’s removal went viral, smartphones with the application downloaded on them began appearing all over the web, selling on sites such as eBay and Amazon for hundreds and, in some cases, even thousands of dollars. With so many knock-off Flappy Bird applications, such as Flappy Crush Saga and others, such an intense reaction to the game’s removal only reinforces the fact that this fixation on the game isn’t about the game at all, but rather the experience users get from the game.
One thing remains unequivocally true — there’s nothing particularly exciting about flying a pixelated bird through a series of pipes. It doesn’t matter that the app was deleted; the fact is that it is easily replaceable. What draws individuals to obsess over such games is the sense of shared struggle and common goals they ultimately carry. It’s what has made past overly hyped games successful, and it’s what will make the next most popular game succeed once the Flappy Bird hysteria subsides.

After weeks of soaring, the notorious Flappy Bird has been grounded at last.
Christina Ellis and Matthew Torres | Daily Trojan
 
This past weekend, the smash hit game was taken down  from app stores after game designer Dong Nguyen tweeted, “I cannot take this anymore.” What exactly could Nguyen not take anymore? From a cursory glance at his Twitter account, it was the overwhelming slew of criticism and vile online harassment that rained negativity on his success. Despite its short life, the app holds many lessons on the new height of danger for games that blow up in both financial and emotional value and, more importantly, the virtue in staying true to the self, as Nguyen did.
In this day and age, when free game apps bring in millions, Nguyen’s decision reflects the increasingly apparent negative consequences of obsessions with games such as Candy Crush and Angry Birds. That the simple act of removing a popular game could create such hype is telling of the importance such games have in society today.
Flappy Bird covered considerable ground this winter, rising from humble beginnings last May. Though it only took a few nights for Nguyen to code the game, he told The Verge that he was raking in $50,000 of profit a day. The appeal of such games is inversely proportional to complexity. The addiction comes from the fact that the game is easy to learn, yet difficult to master.
Nguyen said the original intention of the game was to relax and entertain. Yet because of the obsession and the emotional value invested into it, the game lost its purpose, edging players into dangerous territory.
People can waste days without reaching double digits. Weeks can go by before passing 25 pipes without making Flappy beak-plant. The phenomenon of “Flappy Bird rage” has flown in, along with complaints by App Store reviewers on how the game “robbed them of their productivity, their sanity, and ultimately their soul,” Will Oremus wrote on Slate.
Yes, Flappy Bird has reminded us of the dark side of humans, but there’s also a silver lining to its story — its end as an act of virtue on Nguyen’s part.
Some theorists say that Nguyen’s decision was a strategic move, that he sensed that Flappy Bird would be a fad and that in its removal, mystique would build and create more demand. Yet he doesn’t seem to be the marketing mastermind they’re making him out to be.
Based on Nguyen’s Twitter, the game brought not only fame, but also heaps of envy and spite that he couldn’t quite handle. To a student asking to interview him for an entrepreneurial project, Nguyen denied being an entrepreneur, and to a suggestion to hire a public relations representative, he replied, “I won’t. The PR will make me not an indie game maker anymore.”
The innocence of his earlier tweets — “Wow, my game got in the top 10 U.S. free apps. Thank you, people” — contrasts the despair that seeps through one post on Saturday, reading, “I can call ‘Flappy Bird’ a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it.”
In the end, to stay true to his values — and to a life of  simplicity as a “passionate indie game maker,” as his Twitter account proclaims — Nguyen pulled the plug. After all, everyone knows that when a game becomes more than a game — for the creator and the user alike — the fun ends and the crazy begins.

UPDATE, 12:40 p.m. Thursday: A man who drove onto USC’s campus Wednesday morning after being injured in a shooting south of campus died Wednesday night, authorities reported.
The man was identified as Adrian Dawson, 22,  and died Wednesday at about 8:30 p.m. at California Hospital Medical Center, according to Los Angeles County Coroner spokesman Ed Winter.
The shooting occurred near 57th and Vermont, about two miles south of campus, according to LAPD spokeswoman Wendy Reyes.
“The victim was in a vehicle and the driver drove to the area of Vermont and 36th and that’s where the paramedics were called,” Reyes said.
1:20 p.m. Tuesday: USC’s Gate 6 closed Wednesday morning after a man injured in an off-campus shooting drove to the entrance.
The shooting is considered non-USC related, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. LAPD Detective Mike Lorenz told the Daily Trojan that the shooting took place South of campus.
” … we aren’t sure if it was [a] car to car [shooting] for right now but we’re still interviewing witnesses,” Lorenz said. ” … apparently a vehicle came north that was involved in it and … the person that was in the car got hit several times and was transported to the hospital.”
A fifth Trojan Alert sent out to the USC community at 12:50 p.m. said the area had been cleared.
