The No. 17 USC women’s volleyball team takes on two more top 25 matches at home this week. The Trojans host No. 15 Utah on Thursday and No. 25 Colorado on Saturday. 
The Women of Troy (18-7, 10-4 Pac-12) carry a three-match win streak into two of their final three home matches of the season after sinking Arizona State 3-1 and narrowly escaping Arizona 3-2. This is the third occasion this season that the team has put together a three-match win streak. 
The team should have a good shot at extending its win streak to five matches — tying its longest of the season — as the Trojans are 8-1 at home on the season. 
Last time the Women of Troy and the Utes (18-7, 9-5 Pac-12) met, the Trojans edged out the Utes 3-2 in Salt Lake City. Utah enters the Galen Center having swept Washington State before losing to Washington the previous weekend. Utah is offense-heavy as it is once again led by Adora Anae (4.21 kills per set) who put up 14 kills against USC the last time they played. She is joined by Carly Trueman (2.72 kills per set), Berkeley Oblad (2.47 kills per set) and Tawnee Luafalemana (1.96 kills per set) to steer the Utes’ offense. Both Luafalemana and Oblad also lead the Utes in blocks per set at 1.18 and 1.12, respectively. Utah is hoping to bounce back this week against USC and UCLA after a 1-1 split last week.
After Utah, Colorado (19-6, 9-5 Pac-12) makes its way to the Galen Center to play the Trojans. The last time the Women of Troy and the Buffaloes met, the Buffaloes completed a 3-0 sweep in Boulder. In that game, Brittany Abercrombie was the only Trojan to record a double-digit kill at 12, and the team collectively hit .067 to couple with 23 errors. This time around, the Women of Troy are looking to turn the tables on the Buffaloes. The Buffaloes are led by Alexa Smith, who sports a 4.07 kills per set and struck for eight kills in the previous matchup against USC. Frankie Shebby (3.34 kills per set), Naghede Abu (2.15 kills per set), Joslyn Hayes (2.04 kills per set) and Anna Pfefferle (1.59 kills per set) are all dependable attacking threats. Setter Brynna DeLuzio is currently averaging 11.06 assists per set and delivered 37 assists last time against USC. 
To pick up two more wins at home, USC will need continued strong performances from its pin hitters. Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier, who returned to playing this past weekend, is a dependable hitter. This past weekend, she put up 36 kills in the team’s two wins which was the team-high. Freshman outside hitter Brooke Botkin has been a strong addition to the powerful Women of Troy offense. Botkin tallied 19 kills in the team’s wins against the Arizona schools.
On the opposite side, senior opposites Abercrombie and Niki Withers continue to play well. Abercrombie had 23 kills despite hitting .153 over the weekend. Withers had 13 kills over the weekend with 11 coming against Arizona. Abercrombie is averaging 3.15 kills per set and Withers is averaging 2.60 kills per set on the season, and the two should seek to continue their consistent play this week. 
Setters Reni Meyer-Whalley and Cindy Marina continue to run an effective offense, generating 43 assists against Arizona State and 52 assists against Arizona. The two are averaging a combined 11.56 assists per set, and both have been effective at taking turns in setting up attacking opportunities for the rest of the team. 
The Women of Troy will play No. 15 Utah at 6 p.m. on Thursday and No. 17 Colorado at 1 p.m. on Saturday.

Given that my column runs a bit later in the week, the more obvious issues plaguing this year’s uneven USC football season are usually scooped up on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, I often have to get a little creative. So today, I won’t be talking about Sam Darnold’s turnover prone play, or the shaky offensive line. I won’t be talking about the defense’s inconsistencies or offensive coordinator Tee Martin’s often baffling play-calling decisions (but for the record, he has drawn up solid game plans for the past two games against Arizona and Arizona State). 
Instead, I’ll be discussing one of the more underlying dilemmas facing the 2017 Trojans: head coach Clay Helton’s mind-boggling handling of injuries. 
I support Helton, I really do. Whereas some see his lack of flashiness as a downside, I view his ability to avoid controversy as refreshing, especially considering how scandal has been (and still is — see: Tony Bland) the bane of the USC athletic program’s existence. I also genuinely think he’s a good person, behind whom his players seem to genuinely rally. 
I’ve often heard people explain away Helton’s early success as head coach as a simple byproduct of Darnold’s rapid ascension and nothing else. Sure, last year’s Rose Bowl victory is mostly thanks to No. 14, but I contend that without Helton’s steady leadership and calm presence (despite him very much being on the hot seat), the 2016 Trojans would have been unable to bounce back from that dreadful 1-3 start. Not to mention the fact that Helton recruited Darnold himself, seeing something special that many other power conference schools overlooked. He also knew exactly when to hand Darnold over the keys as the starting quarterback, starting the then-redshirt freshman at a pivotal point in the season against Utah. 
With Helton’s universal designation as a “player’s coach,” it’s even more surprising that he has done a poor job of managing his team’s health this season. At countless press conferences dating back to spring practice, Helton has said something to the effect of, “We’ll always protect a kid. I’d rather lose a ball game than hurt a kid.” (That exact quote was in late August leading up to the Western Michigan game). But that hasn’t always been necessarily true. 
In Week 2 against Stanford, junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin suffered a broken big toe. He underwent surgery during the next week, having two screws implanted. Leading into the next game against Texas, Helton was unsure if Gustin would be able to play, given his surgery mere days beforehand. But Gustin did play in the first half, notching an incredible three sacks, despite being hampered. Yet Gustin’s success was short-lived, and he left the game before halftime. His injured big toe was not only re-broken (reports indicated that one of the screws inside of his toe shifted), but he also suffered a torn bicep, likely from having overextended himself. 
With his toe now in worse shape than before, to go along with the bicep tear, Gustin did not play for the next five games. He returned against Arizona State, playing for a quarter, but he appeared to re-aggravate the toe injury yet again. As of now, Gustin is still out indefinitely with no timetable for a return. 
Injuries are a given in any football season, and USC has dealt with more than its fair share of ailments this year. Yet, losing one of the team’s top five players in Gustin for practically the entire season because of a broken toe is inexcusable. 
At a practice leading up to this weekend’s game against Arizona, Helton was asked if he regretted playing Gustin against either Texas or Arizona. He responded, “No, based on any injury or any player, you don’t do anything until the doctors clear.” While I acknowledge that Gustin’s  misevaluations may rest on the team’s doctors or the physical therapy staff, Helton is still directly responsible for both departments. He should have made the call to keep Gustin out of the Texas game. 
Gustin is not the only example of a player being strangely misevaluated by doctors. Freshman nose tackle Marlon Tuipulotu has been at USC for an entire semester, arriving early for spring ball. Yet, it was not until five games into the season that the medical staff decided he needed to undergo surgery on a preexisting back injury. Tuipulotu, who was supposed to contribute immediately as one of the prized recruits of the 2016 class, is now out for the season having used a medical redshirt. 
While Gustin and Tuipulotu were each rushed on the field with lingering health issues, Helton has treated other players’ injuries, like freshman running back Stephen Carr’s (foot) and sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr.’s (ankle), with supreme caution. 
I want to see him succeed as USC’s head coach, but in the future Helton needs to reevaluate how he handles injuries to avoid losing key contributors when he does not have to.

First off, I claim no expertise in tax policy. I’m an incompetent college kid whose parents manage the bulk of his finances. The closest I ever get to the federal tax code is the byzantine W-9 form I fill out whenever I take on another part-time gig, or otherwise that little number on my receipts that subsidizes megabanks and makes F-35s fly. Like the Force, tax policy is all around us, flowing through everything we do; but most of us, including me, are nowhere near being fiscal Jedi (probably more a function of the blissful ignorance of middle-class privilege than anything else.)
However, there’s a major tax plan under debate in Congress right now, and as an opinion columnist, it’s my duty and purpose to explain it to my fellow college students on the cusp of adulting, and tell them what bodes if it passes. So here goes nothing.
The two most important functions of this multifaceted and nebulous plan are the lowering of the corporate tax by almost half, and the simplification of personal tax rates from seven income brackets to four. 
More controversial are some of the plan’s less central features — namely, the removal of the state and local income tax deductions, and (of interest to college students) the removal of the student loan interest and medical expenses deductions. (Deductions are benefits that reduce an individual’s personal tax rate based on specific conditions they face — such as high state and local taxes, student loans and medical expenses.)
The removal of the state and local tax deduction and the student loans deduction would particularly hit college students and recent graduates, because a) many major universities and post-graduation employment hubs, including USC and its surrounding communities, are in states or at least cities with comparatively higher tax rates than areas with a lower saturation of bachelor’s degrees; and b) for various reasons, a large percentage of college graduates graduate with student loans. Living in blue cities and having debts to pay formerly granted recent graduates somewhat lower taxes; if the current plan is signed into law, those protections go out the window, and there will be a direct effect on graduates’ pocketbooks.

Now, that’s not entirely a cause for alarm. As Julius Krein notes over at American Affairs, the student loans interest deduction is a pittance ($625, maximum) compared to the vast piles of debt we lug behind ourselves as we graduate. And the income brackets adversely affected by the removal of the state and local tax deduction are higher on the income scale, so recent graduates making starvation wages plus tips are affected as harshly as the lower-income residents of blue cities — that is, not as harshly as the lawyers and businessmen higher up the income chain in those same cities. (It’s a poorly hidden secret that this tax plan is in many ways a slam against the “liberal elites” who formed and continue to form much of the vocal opposition to the Trump administration. “The power to tax is the power to destroy,” politics really can be this petty).
One of the aforementioned primary effects of the plan — a lower corporate tax — might be helpful to college grads in the longer run. The lower corporate tax (yes, this does mean those big ugly corporations get to make more money) is largely a ploy to lure corporate investment toward American shores, so it seems. Our high corporate tax is one catalyst of the great offshoring of capital and operations that was such an issue in the 2016 campaign, which is now coming back to the fore with the Paradise Papers. More corporate investment usually means more capital and more job opportunities in regions previously left in the rain.
So the removal of various pro-student and graduate deductions is inconvenient and would hurt people. But the entirety of the tax plan, all things considered, doesn’t appear as bad as it’s occasionally been made out to be. And if we’re looking at the one aspect of “America First” that pretty much everyone can agree is a good thing —  the onshoring of capital from the Cayman Islands back to Wall Street for reinvestment in Wheeling and Watts, two underprivileged cities — the dimmer sides of this tax plan fade in importance.
Again, I know nothing about tax policy beyond what I’ve picked up from thought journals and anecdotes. But the fact that most established political actors, left and right, are opposing it, tells me something might be good about it.

“But the fact that most established political actors, left and right, are opposing it, tells me something might be good about it.”
That’s a dangerous argument. You’re assuming that the established politicians must have bad intentions, that they must be trying to save themselves from something, in an attempt to find a good reason behind this plan.
If anything, the nonpartisan nature of the opposition should tell you that it is indeed a dangerous one.
When you get your first job and start moving your hard earned dollars into your 401(k) plan, you’ll be so happy to know that the companies investment instruments that are represented in your 401(k) plans are growing and making you money while you party after work….  at least until you get married and start a family, then the party changes direction.  :-)
If we do not have a strong economy, everyone suffers to some degree, well, except the 1% ers.   There will always be the 1% folks, as they are in every country on the planet. That’s the way it is, and isn’t going anywhere until we;re living in the worlds of Star Trek, Star Wars, a few millennia away.  
I wouldn’t get all hung up on the reduction in personal taxes for the rich.  What is rich these days?  Everyone deserves a tax break, and thinking that the rich don’t need a tax break, wasn’t this country built on equality for all?  What about protestuing the overburdened spending habits of our government, a bloated decaying whale of an institution that was enormously expanded during the Obama years.  Time to put the feds on a major fiscal diet.
What about the tax and spend policies of the CA legislature in Sacramento?  CA will soon have the highest state income taxes in the country, and following that real estate taxes will increase.  State income taxes are already at an all time high of 13%, on top of the federal taxes, and then once the feds take away some of the federal funding becasue of CA status as a “sanctuary state”, Scato will be forced to increase our taxes again.  Then you’ll find cities increasig their local taxes.  Soonm, the only people living in CA will be illegals, the poor and the uber rich.  Businesses have been leaving CA since the 1990’s due to the high cost of doing business in this state.  
CA used to have one of the highest quality education systems in the country and now ranks near the bottom.
CA has the highest percentage of welfare recipients per capita than any state in the country, at about 22% of the population against the national average of 19%.
As a student who is soon to enter the workforce, my advice is to vote against any and all spending programs and vote for Sacto expense reductions. The biggest threat to your workforce opportunities in CA is a fleeing business climate. For the average worker that is hurting their future.  If you graduate with a degree in the sciences, media and entertainment, accounting and finance, you have a chance.  
CA state legislature is not your friend. They are working to take your money, tell you what to eat and how much, what you can think and say, and to control your life to the point to where you must rely on the government for your subsistence.  Just look at the welfare system.  It was designed back in the 1960’s via president Johnson’s Great Society Plan, to incentivise the black communities to rely on the gubmint for their subsistence and livelihood.  Is that were you kids want to go these days?
Luke, I am your fahthuh!  You’ve heard that a lot I’m sure.
You made a very well thought out statement and it it so right on, that I’m restated it here.  You are so on point.
“So the removal of various pro-student and graduate deductions is inconvenient and would hurt people. But the entirety of the tax plan, all things considered, doesn’t appear as bad as it’s occasionally been made out to be. And if we’re looking at the one aspect of “America First” that pretty much everyone can agree is a good thing —  the onshoring of capital from the Cayman Islands back to Wall Street for reinvestment in Wheeling and Watts, two underprivileged cities — the dimmer sides of this tax plan fade in importance.”
BTW: are you from Wheeling IL?
Perfect!

If the GOP is going to propose slashing corporate taxes, it has to make up the funds somewhere. And one of those places, apparently, is going to be at universities. 
The recently proposed tax plan would make the burden for student loans more painful, significantly increase taxes for Ph.D. students and target rich universities’ endowments — the consequences of which could be catastrophic. 
The tax plan would repeal crucial incentives meant to lessen the burden of higher education costs, especially for low-income and first-generation college students. Tax analyst Scott Greenberg called these tax deductions “sacred cows” on Twitter. Under the Lifetime Learning Credit, low-income students were exempt from taxes for up to $2,000 a year for tuition expenses, while corporations were offered a deduction for education assistance plans. But with the GOP’s tax plan, those benefits would be revoked. It would also force students to pay taxes on their student loan interest. 
And Ph.D. students will see their taxes rise dramatically. These students do not pay tuition at their universities in exchange for their research work and teaching assistantships, but, under the GOP’s tax plan, they will still pay taxes on the tuition they do not pay. That’s because the GOP would classify this tuition waiver as income; an analysis by Vox showed that if a Ph.D. student receives $30,000 in income and receives a $30,000 tuition waiver, they might have to pay taxes on an income of $60,000, which more than doubles their tax burden because it would push them from the 12-percent tax bracket to the 25-percent tax bracket.
That change is shocking. Ph.D. students already make a measly average income of just over $30,000, according to Glassdoor. And The Atlantic reports that, despite not having to pay a fifth of Ph.D. students have over $30,000 in student loan debt upon completion of their program. That’s if they make it at all; half of doctoral students drop out of graduate school, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
Art by Lisa Kam | Daily Trojan
Increasing the burden on both undergraduate and graduate students — who already face significant financial barriers — is not just bad for them, but bad for all of us. The change to Ph.D. students’ income significantly increases their financial obligations, disincentivizing the doctoral path and making it less accessible. It would exacerbate the obstacles low-income students face, for whom reaching graduate level education is already an achievement of massive proportions. Moreover, it means that people who could forge life-saving medical treatments and groundbreaking policy analysis — people who could solve the problems of tomorrow — might never get the skills they need to do so. 
For universities, there are other important new taxes, too, with important implications. Hungry to compensate for corporate tax breaks, the GOP plans to tax some universities’ endowments and compensation for its highest-paid employees. Rightfully so, some say — billion-dollar endowments and executive compensation north of $1 million have raised eyebrows — but taxing these might not actually incentivize universities to lower tuition or curb spending. Demand for college is still relatively inelastic, so nothing stops universities from continuing to pass costs onto consumers; greater tax expenses could justify even greater increases in already sky-high tuition.
Finally, the tax plan would also target charitable gifts to universities. As Brian Flahaven, senior director for advocacy at the Council for Advancement and Support of Education, told The Chronicle of Higher Education, the 30 percent of tax filers that can currently itemize their charitable donations would fall to only 5 percent. That could, according to the National Council of Nonprofits, cause a $13 billion annual decrease in charitable giving, including to universities. That sizable of a decrease in funding for universities threatens their ability to attract high-level faculty and provide students with adequate resources. 
The GOP’s tax plan spells bad news for students and universities, and anyone with an interest in the future of our nation’s higher education should be concerned. Kim Dancy, a senior policy analyst, made a prudent point in an op-ed in CNN.
“Rather than improve the existing program, the GOP plan scraps it entirely, along with several other provisions that make higher education more affordable for students and their families,” Dancy said. “Worse, instead of using the savings to support students in other ways, the GOP bill would enable corporate tax cuts and a phased-in repeal of the estate tax, among other changes.”
And there’s the twist of the dagger. Corporations and high-level executives might rejoice at seeing their taxes slashed, but students — and the future of higher education — are paying the price for it.
Sonali Seth is a senior majoring in policy, planning and development. She is also the special projects editor of the Daily Trojan. “Point/Counterpoint” runs Wednesdays.
One of the reasons the cost of tuition has risen so dramatically is due to the funding of attending college by the government.  If it costs you $1000 per credit to attend and the university knows you’re going to get $500 from the government for tuition assistance, the universities raise the cost to $1500. THis is an analogy, but the fact remains, you take away free college tuition and the universities will be forced to reduce the cost.  Another issue you fail to mention is that Yes, the GOP is looking for ways to reduce taxes for all Americans, no matter their individual income level.  A dollar is a dollar no matter who owns it.  But what the GOP are also working to do is to reduce the size of our bloated federal government that Obama created during his 8 yearsw in office.  It will take time to effect a diet on the federal government, but if you reduce taxes you also reduce expense, well, unless you’re a Democrat.  The DNC platform is one of tax and spend, so what happens is that people who want your money decide how to spend it without any recourse of responsibility.
The blurring hatred of anything the GOP is trying to do to Make America Great Again, by the Democrats only serves to prove that they are obstructionists and will do anything to keep the Trump Administration from its successes, AT THE EXPENSE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMY.  Their plan is to hurt Trump, while hurting you, but gaslighting their followers via their propaganda machine, the alt-left media, to place blame on the Trump Admin and the GOP so that they have a “perceived” chance to win a majority in the House and Senate in the 2018 midterm elections.
In order for the country to get back to its greatness, reduce taxes on individuals and business, everyone has to step up and be accounted for.  So what if grad students only get paid $30k per year. If you cannot afford to stay in school then get a job and work part-time.  We’ve all done it in the past. It’s just that your parents have failed you by not instilling a strong sense of drive, motivation and self awareness.  You kids want everything handed to you.  Well, it’s not happening, and themore you think you can get it for free the more you’ll learn that nothing is free. 
If you want free college, who is going to pay for it? The schools aren’t going to give it to you for free.  Your state, local and federal taxes will increase in order to pay for it.
And you statement about how you think the GOP tax plan is going to hurt you by not providing for scholarships, grants and loans, well the biggest factor that contributes to the state and federal deficits is the money directed away from programs for American citizens over to the illegals and their welfare.  If you promote “saving the illegals” then you have to pay the price for that decision by paying more in taxes and not getting the support of services and programs.  A dollar can only go so far. 
As my Dad told me when I was in elementary school, money doesn’t grow on trees. If you wants something you need to work for it.
Lastly, if you are of the thought process that you will run up your college debt and then decide not to pay it back, I hope the IRS goes after all kids who follow that thought process.  You agreed to go to school and work and pay off your debt.  You and your future will be severely impacted in a negative way for a decade or more if “you” decide to default on t=your school loans, as is the common discussion today on campus across the country.  That is stealing and grounds for incarceration.  Man, you kids are messed up, and I blame your parents and the liberal elements of the side of society you live in.
God bless you Katman!

“Radical Women: Latin America Art, 1960-1985” is on view for free at the Hammer Museum and explores the contributions of Latina artists. Photo from Facebook.
Though Los Angeles is chock-full of art museums, many of their admission prices are more expensive than the Uber fare there. The following museums, ranging from just a short walk away from campus to Brentwood, are completely free and will fulfill any broke college student’s artistic needs on a budget. 
California African American Museum
The California African American Museum is located next to the California Science Center and is walking distance from USC. The focus of this museum is to bring to light the work of African American artists as well as artists from the African diaspora and the African continent. Current exhibits include We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women 1965-1985, which discusses the experiences of the women of color and their roles in creating political change, as well as Circles and Circuits I: History and Art of the Chinese Caribbean Diaspora, an exhibit that highlights the cultural works of Caribbean-based artists of Chinese descent. Both exhibits will be open until February 2018. CAAM is open Tuesday to Saturday from 10 a.m to 5 p.m. and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays. 
Hauser & Wirth 
Hauser & Wirth, located in the Arts District in downtown Los Angeles, will give you an artistic and gastronomical experience that you will not get at most museums. Integrated within the exhibits is either a bar or a restaurant that serves as a social space to discuss the art everyone is surrounded by. Hauser & Wirth’s current exhibits are running until January 2018 and include an installation by renowned artist Mike Kelley titled Kandors. This installation series brings Superman imagery and symbolism to life in a discussion of power, memory and loss. The second major exhibit is titled Accidental Records, a series of paintings by Ellen Gallagher that explores the dark human history of the ocean, over which thousands of slaves crossed to never return. Hauser & Wirth is open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. from Tuesday to Sunday. 
The Getty 
The Getty Center is a classic Los Angeles museum located in Brentwood, about 30 minutes from USC. The founders of the Getty vowed to never impose an admission fee in order to make art accessible to the public and promote the diffusion of artist knowledge in the coming generations. The permanent collection houses four pavilions, each with a different style of European art from Renaissance paintings to contemporary 20th-century Italian pieces. There is also a sculpture garden and a collection of rare photography, books and other pieces that the public can explore. In addition to the permanent collection, there are changing premier exhibits scheduled until the end of January 2018. The Getty is open from Tuesday to Friday and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
The Hammer Museum 
The Hammer Museum is one of the three art museums that are a part of the UCLA School of Arts and Architecture and located in Westwood. Exhibits and programs are completely free and open to the public. Current exhibits are Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960-1985 which highlights the contributions of Latina artists and celebrates Latina and China heritage; and Hammer Projects by Andrea Butter, an installation that focuses on themes of littleness and humility. The Hammer also offers free programs including meditation sessions, poetry readings, art discussions and exhibit tours. This museum is open Tuesday to Friday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. and on weekends from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
The Annenberg Space for Photography 
The Annenberg Space for Photography is an expansive digital and print photography gallery, with over 50 historical exhibits every year. It is located in Century City about nine miles away from USC, but is worth the drive out for its beautiful city location and interesting exhibits. The Space also hosts photography lessons, cultural concerts and a lecture series related to the theme of the exhibits, which currently focus on Cuban history. The first, Cuba Is, explores the aspects and complexities of Cuban life that are often missing among the tense political issues surrounding the island. The second is RESOLVIENDO, which discusses how the rising generation of Cuban youth are redefining Cuban culture. The Annenberg Space for Photography is open Wednesday to Sunday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and will feature these exhibits until March 2018.
MOCA at the Pacific Design Center is also free. The current show is part of the Getty Latin American & Latinx Art in Los Angeles – Organized by ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries, Axis Mundo: Queer Networks in Chicano L.A. maps the intersections and collaborations among a network of queer Chicano artists and their artistic collaborators from the late 1960s to the early 1990s. This period was bookended by the Chicano Moratorium, gay liberation, and feminist movements on one end, and the ravages of the AIDS crisis on the other. Queer Networks in Chicano L.A. marks the first historical consideration of these artists in the context of broader artistic and cultural movements: mail art, the rise of alternative print media, fashion culture, punk music, and artists’ responses to the AIDS epidemic. 
The exhibition will be presented at both the ONE Archives’ gallery in West Hollywood, temporarily located at 9007 Melrose Avenue, and MOCA Pacific Design Center.

An aging king’s descent into madness. A bloodthirsty princess’ ascension. An unrequited and forbidden love. These are the hallmarks of Giuseppe Verdi’s 19th-century operatic masterpiece, Nabucco. Currently on view at the Los Angeles Opera and imbued with star-studded artists, Nabucco is a masterful rendition of a deeply personal and political tale that has repeatedly withstood the test of time. 
First performed in Milan in 1842, at the height of Italy’s suffering under Austrian rule, Verdi’s Nabucco catalyzed a resurgence of hope for liberation and unification. Inspired by historical events but told by fictional characters in four acts, it is set in Babylonian times and tells the tale of the Assyrian king Nabucco, who wages war on the Hebrews of Israel. As Nabucco’s mental state deteriorates, his ruthless, illegitimate daughter Abigaille usurps the throne and, exhorted by the corrupt High Priest of Baal, unleashes a reign of terror on the Hebrews. No one, not even her sister Fenena, who treasonously loves a Hebrew man, is safe. In the end, a deranged Nabucco, reduced to wallowing in a prison cell, and a disgraced Abigaille, having poisoned herself in horror at the destruction wrought by her arrogance, pray to the God of the Hebrews for forgiveness. 
With legendary tenor maestro Plácido Domingo in the title role, operaphiles knew an astonishing performance was in store. Powerful and seamless, Domingo’s vocals were unrivaled in their expressiveness and capacity to convey a wide range of heavy emotions. From the purposeful theatrics of his body movements to his dramatic lyrical delivery, the 76-year-old opera veteran proved his unparalleled position at the forefront of the opera world — a reputation built over a lifetime of accolades and now 50 years gracing the LA Opera stage.

Complementing him on stage as the female lead was Liudmyla Monastyrska as Abigaille in her LA Opera debut. At times summoning both ferocity and anguish, Monastyrska also exhibited dynamic vocals and a formidable stage presence, effortlessly portraying Abigaille at the peak of her regime as well as the depths of her despair. 
The vivacity of the show would not have been complete without the masterful contributions of live pit orchestra conductor James Conlon, director and scenery designer Thaddeus Strassberger, chorus director Grant Gershon and costume designer Mattie Ullrich. 
In particular, Strassberger’s innovative and intricate set design served to fully immerse the audience in the opera experience. In addition to impeccably detailed sets that conveyed an uncanny sense of depth on such a small stage, Strassberger’s mise en scène was aesthetically symmetrical and made dramatic use of shadows and chiaroscuro lighting with help from lighting designer Mark McCullough. 
Perhaps most impressive, however, was Strassberger’s integration of Verdi’s time period into the biblical period during which the story is set. The stage was framed with box seats reminiscent of Milan’s La Scala opera house, where Nabucco first premiered, and saw members of Austrian nobility clad in 19th-century garb also watching the performance — a play within a play. In the end, the cast engages with the Austrian spectators and Italian dissidents hold up flags saluting Verdi to elucidate the metaphorical significance of Nabucco as a timeless tale of political strife. 
Midway into the curtain calls, the cast once again broke into song, this time inviting the audience to sing along and join the rebellion. Original Italian lyrics, instead of their English translations, were displayed overhead and the entire Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was swept up in the spirit of Verdi, once again demonstrating Strassberger’s imaginative stage direction. 
From top to bottom, Nabucco is an indisputable masterpiece that exudes elegance, artistry and political awareness at every turn.

Jessica Williams, a former correspondent on The Daily Show and co-host of the podcast 2 Dope Queens, performed a politically charged stand-up routine in Bovard Auditorium on Monday. Photo by Ria Xi | Daily Trojan
On Monday night, the USC Speakers Committee and Political Student Assembly joined forces to promote political awareness and civic engagement through an inspiring night of political comedy starring Jessica Williams.
Williams was a former correspondent on The Daily Show and is currently a co-host of the podcast 2 Dope Queens. She also starred in the 2017 Netflix movie The Incredible Jessica James.
Though the night promised to address its political undertones, Williams kicked off her set with an icebreaker stand-up routine. She disclosed how she was rejected from USC and spoke at length about a bizarre experience en route to her show at a college in Ohio — an experience that began and ended with a white guy in Jordans offering her marijuana. The anecdote quickly landed at Williams’ stance on recreational drugs: an anxious sputter of “I’d rather not” concerning weed and a wink at something else.
“My life’s mission is to have things not be weird, awkward and sh-tty,” she said, summoning a series of affirmative snaps from the audience. 
Williams went on to talk about where she cultivated her sense of humor — an amalgamation of politically charged anger and her grandmother’s terrific taste in television. Her grandmother introduced her to comedic classics like Saturday Night Live and South Park, a stark change of pace from her Christian upbringing. She described her grandmother as a woman watching television with “her hand under her breasts,” drinking a Colt 45. It was through these experiences that Williams realized she wanted to make people laugh. 
Her political anger — a valid and necessary anger, as she assured the audience — stemmed partly from the outdated practices of the Christian church. Williams recounted a purity ceremony she attended, in which about 20 girls in white gowns pledged their virginity until marriage. Explaining the historic ties of Christianity to African American culture, Williams said she felt that she owed her purity to the community around her.
“I found that I’ve always fallen short of what a black woman is supposed to be,” Williams said. “What is beauty in this country?” 
Finding that her grades were suffering due to an unshakable feeling of inferiority, Williams’ mother offered her a piece of advice that she said awakened her consciousness to the illegitimate and unjust social hierarchies of the world. 
“[My mother said], ‘You can never be average because you look like me and your skin is mine, and because you look like me, you will always have to work 10 times harder,’” Williams said. 
Williams closed her set with the uplifting story of how she got hired as a full-time correspondent on The Daily Show. The anecdote began with television host Jon Stewart walking into her studio reading and singing and ended with how her self-proclaimed “black female anger rock” allowed her to find her voice on the show. The latter, in even more of a dreamscape, led Williams to a five hour “friendship-romantic” dinner with J.K. Rowling.
After wishing the audience good luck with midterms, Williams stayed for an intimate round of questions, the crux of which circled back to her timeless message regarding the political frustrations of the audience.
“We’re all going through a lot of stuff and we carry that around, but now is a good time to be a person of color, queer, Muslim … because people want to hear what you have to say,” Williams said. “If you feel something, that’s where all the good stuff is. Do something.”

Catherine Yang | Daily Trojan
If you thought all Asians were good at math, you probably haven’t met me. And if you know me, you know I can churn out emails, articles, columns, essays and media releases on the daily like a printing press but can barely multiply two numbers in my head or add tip without a calculator. 
In elementary school, I was placed in the highest reading groups but relegated to a middle-tier math class. At an impasse, my parents (who both work in STEM fields) would insist that I study extra problems to improve and that my statistician father sit with me through my nightly math homework. 
Unsurprisingly, these tutoring sessions often culminated in tears of frustration and I would eventually slink back into my room to peruse novels, hating math with a stormier passion after every passing day. 
Throughout high school, the more math and science classes I took, the more apparent it became that I was far from the idealistic STEM-savvy prodigy poised to be an Apple software engineer or to make this century’s biggest medical breakthrough. Instead of chemistry club meetings, I spent my afternoons piecing together the week’s newspaper, my lunch breaks interning as an aide in the school’s writing center and my weekends entering in art and creative writing contests. 
I soared through every English, journalism and social studies course my high school offered, never earning below an A, while I floundered in my math and science classes. Nevertheless, every year, without fail, I signed up for more and more upper-level STEM classes regardless of whether not I enjoyed them. However naively, I bought into the myth that I needed them on my transcript to make myself more marketable to colleges. More than that, I needed to prove that I was who I was supposed to be. 
I remember a New York Times column that circulated through my social media sphere sometime during my junior year of high school. It was called “The Asian Advantage” by Nicholas Kristof, and described cultural factors for disproportionate Asian scholastic success, particularly in STEM fields. Kristof cited the vehement perpetuation of “positive stereotypes” as an underlying reason for academic excellence based on the “Pygmalion effect.” Basically, Asians become good at math to live up to what society already believes about them as a cultural group. 
This may explain why the Asian American community places greater emphasis on the sciences and memorization than on the arts and creativity. But why wasn’t I experiencing Kristof’s self-fulfilling prophetic phenomenon? For those of us whose comparative strengths lay in writing not science, these so-called positive stereotypes present a double-edged sword that create a greater burden and pressure to prove ourselves to society, to our peers, to our parents and to ourselves. 
Art by Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
I sheltered my graded calculus tests from prying eyes in shame, fearful of the snide comment, “I thought Asians were supposed to be good at math,” while my half-joking disclosure that English isn’t my first language yielded shock when our A.P. literature essays were returned. It seemed like everyone around me — namely, the other Asian students at my school with whom I was arbitrarily grouped — was gearing up for careers in medicine and engineering. Meanwhile, all I wanted was to read books, write books and to never step foot in a science laboratory ever again. I simply didn’t fit the mold and I felt alienated from my peers. 
This isn’t to say I was ever bad at math; on the contrary, in retrospect, I have always been a bit above average and earned relatively decent grades. It was just that I never quite seemed to be able to measure up to the Asian standard — which seemed like the only norm against which I could be fairly judged. Although the “all Asians are good at math” formula is meant as a compliment, I have not always perceived it as such. Rather, it plays into the myth of the model minority that labels Asians with archetypes that aren’t overtly offensive yet still perpetuate a form of discrimination. What’s more, it lulls the entire Asian American community into complacency or urges it to manifest cliche traits so long as they remain seemingly positive. 
It wasn’t until recently that I realized how trivial all my worries were. Slowly but surely, I’m learning to see myself for who I am and form an identity independent of that assigned to me based on my ethnicity. I have met like-minded people who share my passions for arts, media and politics and, in both my major and minor, I am pursuing not only what I know but also what I love.
I may not fit a stereotypical Asian mold, but I am more than the rigid mainstream portrayal would have you believe. I am, and always have been, a writer — and that’s perfectly OK.

USC men’s basketball associate head coach Tony Bland was indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury following his arrest in September in connection with a corruption ring. 
Bland was originally arrested with 10 other men also accused of bribery, several of whom have also been indicted. He faces charges for conspiracy to commit bribery, honest services wire fraud and two other charges out of the original six he was accused of at the time of his arrest.
According to the Los Angeles Times, the indictment formally accused Bland alongside fellow Division I assistant coaches Book Richardson of Arizona and Lamont Evans of Oklahoma State, sports agent Christians Dawkins and Merl Code of Adidas who face similar charges. Auburn assistant Chuck Person and Rashan Michel, who is a former NCAA referee and owns a clothing company, were charged in a separate indictment. It is not yet known if Adidas employee Jim Gatto, who was also arrested, was indicted on Tuesday.
 Financial adviser Munish Sood and Florida youth coach Brad Augustine, who were both charged initially in September were not indicted. The court granted their attorneys a two-week continuance to negotiate a deal, according the Los Angeles Times.
Bland was put on administrative leave in late September by USC following his arrest. 
He is charged with taking a $13,000 bribe in July from Sood and Dawkins to sway college athletes to use their services, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
“Bland also confirmed that, by virtue of his position as a coach for the University of Southern California’s basketball team, he exerted significant influence over his athletes in deciding which agents and advisers to retain,” the indictment said, according to the Times.
He was also charged with giving $9,000 to two families of USC basketball athletes in late August. The indictment also accuses Bland of defrauding the University by hiding the bribes that caused the school to give athletic scholarships to athletes regarded as ineligible due to the bribe payments.
Following the arrest, USC hired former FBI director Louis J. Freeh to conduct an internal investigation.
“Everyone loves Tony Bland,” head coach Andy Enfield said in an interview last week with the Daily Trojan. “He was a big part of what we did here for over four years, and other than that, we can’t comment. It has been emotional, it has been challenging, at a personal level and at a program level.”
The investigation of the corruption ring had been underway since 2015. Evidence of the bribery was uncovered partly by the FBI agents working undercover who gained access to the corruption ring as financial backers and partners, according to an affidavit released by federal prosecutors. 
Bland has been the associate head coach since 2014.
“I’m very confident about our program moving forward,” Enfield said last week. “We have tremendous staff and tremendous players in our program.” 
Eric He contributed to this report.
