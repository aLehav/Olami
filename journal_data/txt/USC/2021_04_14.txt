Three women’s golf players competed in the Fresno State Classic at Copper River Country Club in the individual’s tournament on Monday and Tuesday.
In her fourth start this year, freshman Brianna Navarrosa led the Trojans, taking second place with an impressive 10-under par overall 206. After Monday’s round, she was in third place at 3-under, 6 shots off from the lead. She finished her final round Tuesday with four birdies on her last six holes to secure her second place finish. 
“I was hitting it really solid, my short game has gotten a lot better compared to my last couple tournaments so I think that was a big advantage this tournament,” Navarrosa said. “I really think it was my short game and I made a lot of putts which helped as well.” 
This is her career best effort since joining the team. She finished eighth at the season-opening Lamkin Invitational and tied for 11th at the Sun Devil Winter Classic in February. 
Stanford freshman Rachel Heck won the tournament with a 16-under 200. 
USC junior Katherine Muzi tied for 16th with a 3-over 219 and freshman Christine Wang tied for 31st with an 8-over 224. Muzi’s 3-over is her best score and second-highest finish out of her five starts this season. A double bogey in each of the first two rounds of the tournament kept her from breaking under par. Wang’s tie for 31st is the best placement of her two starts this season— she excelled on Cooper River’s par 5’s making birdie on four of her 12 attempts.
This was the last regular season tournament appearance for No. 6 USC. The Trojans will head to the Pac-12 championship next weekend before the NCAA Regionals. One of their biggest competitors in the postseason will be No. 9 Arizona State. 
“Our biggest competition is ASU,” Navarrosa said. “They are one of the top ones and as strong as our team is … it really all depends on where regionals are for us, we’re thinking it’s gonna be up in Nor Cal so Stanford’s gonna be another big competitor for us but hopefully we will finish up on top.”
USC and ASU have met twice so far this season at the Sun Devil Winter Classic and the Silverado Showdown. USC placed first in both tournaments, and ASU finished second and tied fourth, respectively. 
The Pac-12 is a stacked conference this year, with Oregon and Arizona rounding out the teams in the rankings at No. 14 and No. 23, respectively. 
The Pac-12 championship begins on April 23 at Stanford University Golf Course in Stanford, Calif.

In the age of virtual events, USC OWN IT Executive Directors Ines Ramirez and Mitali Shanbhag grappled with how to pull together a conference dedicated to fostering a sense of community between women and nonbinary people. 
OWN IT, a student-run non-profit organization that originated at Georgetown University, hosts an annual leadership summit in its various chapters dedicated to inspiring and advising female and non-binary leaders across all industries.
Ramirez said that the OWN IT team originally prepared for the summit to be a hybrid event, with the possibility of returning to in-person events by Spring 2021. The two-day summit, which took place last weekend, would typically feature in-person speakers at Bovard Auditorium, complimentary goodie bags for attendees and a chance to connect with other people who attend the conference.
However, the team ultimately chose to pivot to a fully virtual format, functioning mainly through an app called Whova, which allowed attendees to access webinar links to the various panels, engage with other participants in a public chat and even connect to panelists and moderators through a “Q&A/Say Hi!” feature.
“To be honest, it’s almost been like just creating a completely new event from scratch, so a lot of roles, [logistics and] responsibilities have changed,” Ramirez said. “We’ve kind of just adapted along the way.”
The digital summit brought challenges, but also created space for unique opportunities that simply couldn’t happen in person, Ramirez said. This year’s conference featured a diverse set of respected speakers including Gloria Steinem, prolific journalist, activist and keynote speaker, Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America and Sophia Amoruso, founder of the clothing brand Nasty Gal.
 “For the first time in [USC OWN IT] history, we have speakers, moderators, sponsors from literally all over the world joining us [from] different time zones, and coming together just because we all have these key values and this mission in common,” Shanbhag said.
The virtual format of the conference also meant that the conference had many more family members of both USC and non-USC students, according to Ramirez. In addition, the virtual conference allowed for flexibility in the sorts of events the team wanted to have, such as a opening workout session.  
With the strain on mental health, rampant Zoom fatigue and constant threat to health and wellness brought on by the past year, mental and physical health was brought to the forefront of the conversations at this year’s summit. The Saturday portion of the summit opened with a workout session, followed by a workshop about the importance of flow states and a meditation session with Gillian Finely, a lecturer of ballet and pilates at the Kaufman School of Dance.
“I think the virtual summit has allowed us to do things like the workout class, where an attendee can participate in the workout and then they get 30 minutes, they can just jump upstairs, hop in the shower and then go downstairs, grab some breakfast. They don’t have to walk all the way back to their dorms and whatnot,” Ramirez said.
According to attendees, the virtual format of the conference did not hinder OWN IT 2021 from accomplishing its mission. Gabriella Margarino, a senior majoring in cognitive science, attended webinars for both days of the conference tuning into conversations about wellness, workplace confidence and enacting change.
“I haven’t felt as motivated and as supported by [a] female community in a really really long time, especially with [the coronavirus] and not being able to gather in spaces and have those female-centered conversations or communities as much,” Margarino said. “There were just so many women who were so willing to just lay out their story and support other women.”
Margarino referenced “The Power in Platforms: Enacting Change” panel with Alyson Stoner and Liz Hernandez, recalling that she had no expectations of what the panel would consist of, since she only knew Stoner from the movies and films from her childhood.
Now, Stoner is the founder of MovementGenius, a holistic fitness program that reconnects mind, body and being through creativity, and has led programming for major organizations such as the United Nations, the World Economic Forum and the World Health Organization. 
Another noteworthy speaker who is known in the media and took on her own ventures was Julianne Hough, Emmy-winning dancer, musician and actress who also founded her own health and wellness experience brand, KINRGY (pronounced “kinergy”) and has concurrently engaged in numerous other philanthropic efforts.
As demonstrated by Stoner’s and Hough’s focus on mind and body connection, the conversations that they hosted were not the typical “how to advance your career” talk that many summits would focus on, Shanbhag said. The executive directors of OWN IT said this was a very deliberate choice when rolling out the programming for this year’s summit.
“I feel like we really did want to showcase an array of nontraditional and traditional career paths, because I think one thing you notice, especially now, is that there’s no direct path to success and there [are] so many definitions of success,” Shanbhag said. “I think by redefining what values that we hold near and dear to us, we were able to create a summit that represented those values and bring in speakers that represented those as well.”
Not only were the conversations illuminating, but the sessions managed to feel intimate despite being fully virtual, according to Maya Fine, a senior majoring in business administration. Fine moderated the “Careers in Consulting” breakout session with several businesswomen and said she appreciated the opportunity to hear their insights, as someone entering the consulting industry upon graduation. When comparing her experience at another virtual conference, Harvard University’s “Virtual Ventures in Management Program,“ she found this year’s OWN IT to be much more personal. 
“It felt so much more intimate, like the size of the breakout panels, even in the webinars, I think they were a little more personalized because the target audience is so much more specific,” Fine said. “People wanted to participate and pay attention even though it was virtual.”
In addition to wellness-centered conversations and an emphasis on interconnectedness during the summit, several OWN IT panels featured women and nonbinary entrepreneurs detailing their business journey. One conversation, “Paving Paths: Making Room and Taking Space,” featured four women from very different spaces – technology, gun law reform, sexual health and skincare for Black women – but the conversation offered universal truths about navigating male-dominated industries and breaking through barriers of entry by conveying value to their ideas. 
“I try to just meet them where they’re at,” said Beatrice Dixon, founder and CEO of feminine hygiene brand the Honey Pot Co. regarding the obstacles she faced in selling her product to a room full of men. Dixon advised young entrepreneurs to find a point of connection to women in the lives of the men she was selling to.
Almost all of the panels shared a common thread of unwavering support for women across all industries and a sense of sorority among the trailblazers in the event. 
“I didn’t walk through a door just to close it for somebody else,” said Tiana Kara, executive director of BUILT BY GIRLS, an organization that helps female and non-binary students ages 15-22 get involved in technology by offering mentorship and guidance.
The diversity of the conference was bountiful, which Ramirez said was not a coincidence for this year’s summit in particular as the team seized the opportunity to elevate marginalized voices in nearly every panel of the conference.
“We set some goals for ourselves at the beginning of last summer of what we wanted our outreach to look like for sponsors, for speakers and for attendees,” Ramirez said. “We’re really proud to say that for our breakout panels, and for most of our speakers, we [surpassed] our goal of about 50% Black, indigenous, people of color speakers, so we’re really proud of that, but we still know that there are a lot of strides to make.”
Shanbhag said that the inspiration for an emphasis on showcasing marginalized voices had a personal connection to her. As an aspiring executive at a tech corporation, Shanbhag sees the power to enact change in the conversations featured at OWN IT.
“As a female person of color, I grew up really not seeing role models that looked like me in the positions that I hoped to be in one day when I was older … it was really hard for me to understand how my career path would look just on a personal level,” Shanbhag said. “I think that’s where change starts, starting these difficult conversations, showcasing intersecting identities and redefining our values of what really is important to us.”

The 141st Undergraduate Student Government Senate convened for the second time under the newly-established Areias-Warren administration at Tuesday’s meeting and passed its first resolution on Kosher dining. 
Vice President Lucy Warren introduced the resolution, which was first presented last week by Benjamin Shiff, president of Chabad @ USC. The resolution focuses on establishing a University-recognized Kosher —  the term used to describe foods that meet the dietary needs of the Jewish community — restaurant. 
According to the resolution, USC originally began a Kosher food preparation program in Spring 2018, where students picked up pre-packaged Kosher food at the University Village. However, the program proved unviable due to finances, the lack of attention over its existence and its inability to correspond with students’ schedules. 
“Over time, [the Kosher program] was slowly phased out just because there wasn’t so much student support for it,” said Shiff in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “However, it’s hard to say if there’s [no] student support for Kosher food or just for this option. So what was recently decided was, if we’re going to push for this to be an option, we really want it to be something equitable to the regular meal plan.”
All senators voted unanimously to pass the resolution. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Sen. Ruben Romeo III said the efforts towards implementing Kosher food in the dining hall would allow the University to be “more thoughtful” about student needs. 
“For someone who’s been working on this for four years, and on behalf of the partner organizations that have been working on this for far longer, it really meant the world to us,” Shiff said. “Hopefully, we’ll be able to use this resolution … [and] further show [the University that] there’s student support behind this, and create an equitable Kosher food option on campus.”
During the Senate meeting, Warren also presented the nominations for the Legislative Branch Committee. 
The Legislative Branch Committee Chairs, operating under the vice president, hold policy-making and advocacy powers and consist of six permanent standing committees on topics such as wellness affairs, accessibility and affordability and basic needs. 
Zaid Diaz-Arias, a freshman majoring in public policy, will serve as USG’s first parliamentary secretary, a position that performs the duties of secretary and parliamentarian, including recording votes, taking minutes and sending documents to the president or Graduate Student Government. Juniors David Atash and Finley Davis to the Committee on Wellness Affairs and the Committee on Sustainability & Campus Infrastructure, respectively. In total, seven students were nominated. The Senate approved the nominations unanimously.
Chief Financial Officer Adenike Makinde also announced the Funding Department nominations. The branch provides fiscal support and resources to recognized student organizations and undergraduate students. Shortly afterward, Chief Communications Officer Kros Day announced the nominees for the Communications Department, which maintains communication between USG and the student body. Nominees will be approved at next week’s meeting.
Sen. Romeo was also elected Speaker of the Senate for the second year in a row. Romeo said he will also be a part of a potential temporary special committee of the legislative branch. Still unnamed, the committee will function as a coronavirus task force.

The podcast “BFFs,” hosted by Barstool CEO-turned-public figure Dave Portnoy and 19-year-old TikTok giant Josh Richards, is my guilty pleasure.
In the podcast, Richards, who boasts 24.5 million followers on the platform and is linked with household TikTok names Charli and Dixie D’Amelio and Addison Rae, sits down with Portnoy for an inside dissection of the week in pop culture. Mostly, they are known for their expository and straightforward style and ability to get to the bottom of social media tea with transparency that puts clickbait to shame.
 Before I dive into this, I’d like to put out a disclaimer that I know my shameless devotion to TikTokers and their interpersonal lives constitutes a questionable hobby for a 21-year-old. You don’t have to tell me. That being said, I will continue to nurture my obsession under the guise of my column’s “sociopolitical analysis of pop culture.” In case anyone wants to call me a loser, that is my loophole. 
Let’s get to it.
The social media drama item on everyone’s (read: mine and the rest of the world’s 12-year-olds) mind is “BFFs” host Richards’ recent break-up with fellow TikTok star and girlfriend Nessa Barrett. The two seemed to be thick as thieves, but cracks started to show when Barrett began making music with Richards’ close friend, Jaden Hossler. Hossler’s ex-girlfriend, Mads Lewis, swiftly took to TikTok to accuse Barrett and Hossler of getting a little too close for comfort. 
On the podcast, Richards denied all rumors of intimacy between Barrett and Hossler, but it was clear the drama had taken a toll on the 19-year-old. He expressed that he and Barrett were “done for good,” his trademark toothy grin visibly twisted into a frown, and the conversation between him and Portnoy shifted to the implications of the hyper-visibility of TikTok stars. (It’s worth mentioning that Monday night after I drafted this installment, Barrett and Hossler went public with their relationship, leaving Richards looking like the village idiot. Yikes.)
Portnoy said something to the effect of the fact that Richards and his peers are regular teenagers going through regular teenage drama — but that drama is being systematically commodified for consumer culture. Their every move, decision and mishap is publicized for millions upon millions of followers to scrutinize, criticize, circulate and dissect. Social media armies have never been more ready and willing to attack at any and all indications of foul play, no matter how unfounded, and public figures have never, well, been more public than they are today. 
This got me thinking. I stared at Richards through my computer screen as he talked, and, for the first time, I didn’t see a product or a vehicle for likes, views or subscriptions. I saw a person — a child — who was really, really sad. 
We’re all familiar with the child-star-to-basket-case pipeline that includes the likes of Britney Spears, Amanda Bynes, Demi Lovato and Lindsay Lohan. It’s no hot take that growing up in the public eye can beget serious, irreversible problems that nothing and no one are really working to circumvent. In fact, I wrote about this endemic in a recent installment.
But how about growing up in the public eye in 2021, at the peak of TikTok’s popularity and social media fanaticism? Given that adolescence is a time period during which peer influence and socialization are key predictors of adaptive development and that TikTok-famous teens are essentially adult baby Internet punching bags, I don’t think it’s crazy to say that these kids are going to need serious therapy a few years down the line. 
Beyond the unprecedented omnipotence of social media lies the reality that the entertainment industry, and by extension TikTok, has never been so unpredictable or subject to constant change. Public figures can go from beloved to canceled, hero to zero, at the literal click of a button — look no further than the recent controversies surrounding Shane Dawson and David Dobrik for evidence. 
The bigger they are, the harder they fall, right?
Point being: When it comes to young burgeoning TikTok stars, not only is their mental health a negligible consideration exploited by anonymous Internet swaths, but the nature of their success is also completely elusive and unreliable. Next week or even tomorrow, a new platform could pop on the radar that relegates TikTok’s most influential giants to the margins of invisibility. 
And let me ask you this: Who will be there to pick up the pieces for those kids if that does become the case? Their PR teams? Agents? Think again. 
Richards is arguably the brightest and most financially strategic of the TikTok giants. He is the chief strategy officer of TikTok-wannabe Triller, co-founder of talent agency TalentX Entertainment and is launching a venture capital fund under the mentorship of an ex-Goldman Sachs banker to supplement his TikTok earnings. His net worth spiked to over a million in under a year and is steadily growing. 
But who says Richards or his peers, come time to put their TikTok days behind them and settle down, will be in any state to reap the fruits of their labor? These are young kids with vulnerable, impressionable brains. To think that they have any chance of escaping the social media spotlight mentally unscathed is more than naive — it’s negligent. 
TikTok giants are but lambs being led to the slaughter — and guess what? We’re the owners of the slaughterhouse.

Even though the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books is virtual once again this year, it’s likely that many book-lovers can’t help but feel optimistic these days. With L.A. County’s vaccines rolling out ahead of schedule, coronavirus cases declining and restrictions on businesses loosening, it feels as though a return to life as it was prior to the pandemic, or at least something very close to it, is on the horizon. 
However, it wasn’t long ago when the circumstances were remarkably less hopeful. Only approximately one year ago, L.A.’s independent bookstores were forced to abruptly shut down in response to a virus that most Americans still knew very little about. 
“We shut our doors when the order came down from the state,” said Mary Williams, co-owner and general manager at Skylight Books in Los Feliz. “It was a lot of work, and we were just not making anywhere near enough money. We went through half of our savings staying open. We did get a [Paycheck Protection Program] loan which helped us a lot, but it was unsustainable and I was really concerned about how long we were going to be able to hold out and stay in business.”
Only months ago, independent bookstores like Skylight Books were still weathering the challenges associated with staying afloat financially and keeping employees and customers safe amid the worst surge in coronavirus cases and deaths that California had experienced to date. 
“It was nerve-racking,” said Julia Cowlishaw, CEO of Vroman’s in Pasadena and Book Soup in West Hollywood. “We were grateful we still had good strong sales, we had people that wanted to shop with us both online and in stores, but being in Los Angeles County, which was just on fire with COVID at that time, was really a very stressful time to feel the need to continue to operate the business under those circumstances and absent vaccinations.”
Skylight Books, Vroman’s and Book Soup are among four other local independent bookstores — Once Upon a Time in Montrose, Pages in Manhattan Beach, Small World Books in Venice and The Ripped Bodice in Culver City — that will serve as designated partner booksellers at this year’s Festival of Books.
In pre-pandemic iterations of the festival, being a partner bookseller meant having an exhibit or tent to showcase and sell books to throngs of book enthusiasts in attendance. During the pandemic, partner booksellers will instead function as specifically designated sellers at each of the festival’s virtual panels and, in most cases, will offer signed bookplates exclusive to their stores. 
Even though the circumstances aren’t ideal for partner booksellers, many of those interviewed said that the festival has and will continue to be an incredible opportunity for their stores to gain some visibility from book lovers unfamiliar with their stores, celebrate books and authors and generate sales — sales that are especially needed after a long slog adapting to the difficulties posed by the pandemic. 
For the Festival partner booksellers, two characteristics appear to have been a through-line throughout the past year: uncertainty and unrelenting change. Partly because of the ever-evolving nature of the United States’ fight against the pandemic, state and local regulations for businesses changed frequently and at times, erratically, forcing many stores to respond quickly and make dramatic changes on very short notice. 
“It’s very stressful because, first and foremost, I feel a tremendous responsibility to the safety of my staff and certainly didn’t open a bookstore with the idea that daily changing protocols of how to operate safely in a pandemic were going to be [part of the job],” said Linda McLoughlin Figel, founder and owner of Pages. 
Pages is a general interest bookstore located just a couple blocks from the Manhattan Beach Pier and is such an integral part of its local community that “every kindergartner who starts in the Manhattan Beach Unified School District gets a gift card from them that welcomes them to the world of reading,” Figel said. California’s first shelter-in-place order was issued just one week after the store celebrated its 10-year anniversary, forcing Figel and her team to shut down and make quick changes. 
Those changes included pivoting to curbside, or in Pages’ case, courtyard-side pickup, changing relationships with suppliers because some put a stop on all orders and staggering staff to ensure proper social distancing guidelines were being met, all while committing to keep all staff employed among other challenges.
In spite of Pages’ efforts, the bookstore still experienced a 50% decline in sales from March to June in comparison to its previous non-pandemic years. 
“Those [were] the dark days, for sure,” Figel said. 
Leah Koch, USC alumnae and co-owner of The Ripped Bodice, one of two romance-focused independent bookstores in the United States, was also forced to make quick changes to adapt to pandemic-induced restrictions. The store quickly shifted to processing 100% of its orders online, compared to about 25% in previous years, with Koch packing many of the online orders herself. 
“[There] was a real inability to plan for the future at all,” Koch said. “I just had no idea, maybe tomorrow, they’re going to say I can’t leave my house … and there was a time I was definitely worried FedEx or UPS was going to shut down. If we can’t get books then we can’t send people books and then we can’t make money.”
Book Soup, Skylight Books, Small World Books and Vroman’s all made rapid adjustments while facing frightening uncertainty as well. At Skylight Books, curbside pickup was implemented, plexiglass was installed and much of the store was rearranged to allow customers to safely social distance inside. At Vroman’s, the book store transitioned from less than 1% of its sales being online to 100% of its sales being online. After the summer, however, the store still found itself in dire-straits and made a plea to its followers on Twitter to help keep the store afloat. 
Fortunately for L.A., it appears that all of this year’s partner booksellers have successfully weathered the pandemic. At the time of publication, all of them remain open and allow for in-store shopping, albeit at limited capacity per state and local guidelines, and all of those interviewed credited the work of their employees and support of their customers as the two biggest factors in making it this far. 
Now, with circumstances seemingly improving, many book sellers expressed sincere optimism, though some still held reservations due to uncertainty over the future course of the pandemic and how it might affect customer behavior. 
“I think we’re getting excited to open up again,” said Adam Lipman, manager at Small World Books. “You know it’s one of those things where we’re not really sure what to expect — are people going to be running out and wanting to spend money or are they going to be scared about the economy?”
Williams, for her part, also expressed excitement at the prospect of conditions at Skylight Books returning to what they once were prior to the onset of the pandemic. 
“We’re really hoping to rearrange everything back to the way it used to be once having six feet between everyone’s desks is no longer necessary,” Williams said. “And we’re looking forward to not being scared at work anymore anytime someone coughs.”

For 25 years, the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books has brought thousands of Los Angeles residents, press, students, celebrities and families together for entertaining events and stimulating conversations. To many, the festival has become an annual tradition where children meet their idols, adults find inspiration and book lovers explore exciting new reads — a place where Angelenos could gather as a community in one place for a weekend of festivities. 
From 75,000 attendees its first weekend ever when it was founded by Narda Zacchino and Lisa Cleri Reale during their career at the L.A. Times in 1996 — where the festival experienced so much success that the head of the Times’ PR department at the time had to call in staff to be on-site to handle media requests and sponsors called to participate for the next year — to recent years with 150,000 attendees, the L.A. Times Festival of Books has grown exponentially and become the biggest book festival in the country. 
As per tradition, the 2021 L.A. Times Festival of Books will be held from April 17-23, featuring over 30 events and multiple stages over a seven-day period.
Amid coronavirus safety directives from the city, this year’s festival will be held in a virtual format like last year. Last year’s festival was postponed to fall and held over a series of four weeks. Though the 2019 festival operated successfully and received a lot of positive feedback from audiences and panelists, Ann Binney, special projects coordinator at the L.A. Times, said the production and programming team learned a lot from the last festival and used that experience to implement more programming and better engagement.
According to Binney, the festival will be available for live streaming on the L.A. Times Festival of Books website, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook with video recordings uploaded to the website later so those unable to attend can still watch the events, in contrast to last year’s festival which was completely held over YouTube.
“We have an amazing production team that is part of the L.A. Times; we’re really lucky that way that we have an L.A. Times studio which has people who come from the world of television,” Binney said. “They know how to produce TV shows; they understand the video and audio and [they] know how to put it all together. We are super lucky to have that resource as part of the L.A. Times. They have the knowledge and resources to make this event really great.”
Feeling more comfortable with the technology, Binney said the team behind the Festival of Books decided to include more programming compared to last year, such as individual stages for poetry and children along with recordings of poets and authors reading excerpts from their recent work. 
For the most part, the festival remains free as Zacchino and Reale had intended it to be. Not wanting a lack of money to keep people away from an event meant to promote literacy, love of reading and discussions of ideas, this year there are some events such as those with Don Lemon and Richard Thompson, where tickets cost five dollars.
Going back to its traditional April timing, the festival will once again be tied to the L.A. Times Book Prize Program, where several book prize authors will be featured in the festival’s programming. The Festival was unable to coincide with the Book Prize Program last year since it was postponed until fall.
“It’s a new experience, just in terms of everything that we’re offering,” Binney said. “There’s new programming, new faces and new additions of children’s stage and poetry stage. We hope that people will come and join us and look at what we have to offer over the seven days and all the many different kinds of events and the amazing authors that we’re featuring.” 
Binney said the team hopes to be back on USC’s campus next year to bring that community together for the amazing experience that has made the festival what it is over the last years. 
“I think that we will take a lot of what we learned back into that physical world, when we get back there, and hopefully employ some of these things that we learned that allow us to bring these events to a larger audience that goes beyond Southern California, beyond Los Angeles,” Binney said. “We’ve had people join us from all around the country, we’ve had people join us out of the country for a lot of these conversations we’ve convened over the last year, so we hope to bring that to a wider audience.”
In the past, Angel Rodriguez, special projects editor for the L.A. Times, has moderated two sports panels in the Festival of Books in 2018-19. This year, Rodriguez is hosting a bilingual children’s book panel to empower young people of color and provide representation to the L.A. Latinx community.
Even though most students and workers have gotten used to Zoom, Rodriguez still finds it difficult to engage audiences during virtual events. To connect with the audience, Rodriguez felt it was important that there was enough time to answer audience questions. To keep children engaged, Rodriguez asked guided questions about the background and motivations of the characters in the panelist’s books, which would be familiar to the children. 
“As a moderator when you’re on a panel, you need to be a little bit more cognizant of the fact that you need to make sure that there’s that ability to engage with the audience. It’s really more about reinforcing that engagement,” Rodriguez said.
Other than maintaining Zoom engagement, another challenge Rodriguez faced as a moderator was picking up on body language cues from the panelists and audience, which would help him indicate their level of comfort in past events. It was impossible for Rodriguez to tell whether audience members were laughing or on their phones, and it was hard to read cues when a panelist wanted to speak up or not, when they appeared as a small boxed face on the Zoom screen.
“It’s just a different way of doing it, so you just have to be cognizant of the differences,” Rodriguez said. 
This Saturday, the L.A. Times Festival of Books will kick off its 26th installment with President Carol  Folt, L.A. Times writers and the Trojan Marching Band, and then proceed to host over 30 events with diverse authors, speakers and poets for various events. From its incredible start, the festival continues to grow and bring the community together, even virtually.
“There is no comparing it to a live event, where book lovers gather, going from booth to booth, from outdoor stage to auditorium, nourishing and developing a love of books and reading — the same goals Lisa and I had in 1995 when we set out with our small committee to put on a festival of books,” Zacchino wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “But the upside is that, being virtual, people from all over can participate, perhaps increasing the audience way beyond numbers we ever could have imagined.”
With the partnership between the L.A. Times and USC to host the Festival of Books, the event will return to campus for the next in-person experience.
“USC has served as the home of the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books for the past 10 years,” executive director of USC’s Vision and Voices Daria Yudacufski said in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “The festival’s purpose of bringing the community together through books, art, music and culture is more important and necessary than ever. I’m so glad that the L.A. Times and USC are continuing to make the festival available for the community.”

Universities around the country continue to grapple with inequities that are ingrained into their institutions. 
Following months of racial justice protests that increased transparency around racism in higher education, universities are considering curriculum changes as a primary channel to foster informed and inclusive environments. 
Last year, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill requiring California State University students who enter as freshmen in 2021-22 to take an ethnic studies requirement in order to graduate. The requirement, mandated across all 23 campuses, requires students to take one course in either Native American studies, African American studies, Asian American studies or Latinx studies. 
The bill wasn’t passed without opposition. The competing plan, proposed by the university system, presented a broader ethnic studies curriculum which incorporated a social justice angle. These classes aimed to bring current events into the classroom, including police brutality, immigration status and public health disparities.
The discourse around how best to define ethnic studies, and how specified these courses should be, is ongoing at USC. 
History of the diversity requirement
USC has yet to institute a specific ethnic studies requirement that would require students to take a class on one of the aforementioned groups. Rather, USC’s general education curriculum is rooted in two diversity requirements that offer courses across a broad thematic range. 
But there’s a distinction between ethnic studies courses and the existing diversity requirement at USC.
In 1995, USC implemented its first diversity requirement. The courses offered focused specifically on how identity and inequalities impacted the American social, political and economic landscape. 
This preliminary diversity requirement came under review, facing criticism from faculty members underscoring that these courses failed to present information through an international lens.
In 2015, faculty moved to implement a second requirement which expanded the existing courses into two general education requirements, turning the original six general education requirements into eight. The current diversity requirements — “Citizenship in a Diverse World” and “Traditions and Historical Foundations” — are what students must take to graduate. 
Despite the expansion, the parameters around diversity remain broad, according to Viet Thanh Nguyen, an English, American Studies and Ethnicity and Comparative Literature professor at USC, who worked on the committee that approved courses for the former diversity requirement. 
Nguyen reaffirmed the importance of ethnic studies courses as providing a space to address real world events impacting different groups and demographics. He referenced the Black Lives Matter protests, police violence and the recent attack against Asian American women in Atlanta. 
“In my mind, it all points to a very particular set of historical issues in the United States that are tied to the International, but need to be addressed in terms of the particular American confluence of race, violence, class, labor exploitation, and so on, which is what an ethnic studies requirement would do,” Nguyen said. 
This requirement could provide students with a nuanced and dimensional exploration into how history shapes the inequities of the present, Nguyen explained. 
“So the reason to talk about different groups, whether you call them ethnicities, or races or cultures and so on, is not to celebrate them, but to talk about why they exist in this country defined the way that they are and that their existence in this existence in this country is tied to power and exploitation and imbalances,” Nguyen said.
Debating the curriculum 
Deciding how to designate a curriculum that talks about different groups is complex, said Richard Fliegel, the associate dean for Undergraduate Programs in Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences who oversees the general education curriculum development. To institute an additional ethnic studies requirement, or to replace existing curriculum, would require a broad collective consensus from faculty across different disciplines and areas of studies at USC. 
“Arriving at that kind of a consensus of the faculty is something that takes some work, and in fact, changes over time,” Fliegel said. 
Beyond the need for agreement across faculty, Fliegel also explained that an ethnic studies course may narrow the intersectionality that the existing diversity courses attempt to achieve, as the wide-ranging classes explore a multitude of demographics, identities and histories. 
“We can’t have an endless series of requirements that respect the lived experience of each group individually, and that’s usually why we end up with requirements that don’t specify the particular dynamics of difference but that encourage people to understand the kind of analysis that would allow us to transcend those attitudes,” Fliegel said. 
But for professors and students alike, a broad diversity curriculum dilutes necessary conversations around power at a local, national and international level. 
“I think the University and the faculty are generally kind of conservative,” Nguyen said. “They don’t want to have a requirement that basically confronts power.” 
Tangible action on behalf of the University is required in order to unpack and dismantle harmful power structures, Nguyen said. 
“So we will have the administration putting out statements [saying,] ‘Hey, anti-Asian hatred and violence are wrong.’ That’s fine. But let’s do something about it, and actually use a core course, to talk about something like anti-Asian hatred and violence,” Nguyen said. 
Concern around racial inequality and violence can’t be rooted in performative actions, Nguyen explained. 
“And not just that, obviously, but again, how racism and violence against minorities, whether it’s physical violence, or structural violence, labor exploitation, sexual violence — all of these are issues of power that need to be addressed in our curriculum, not just at the level of the rhetoric of the university,” Nguyen said. 
Many faculty members feel the administration is falling short of instituting necessary curriculum changes. 
Ariela Gross, a professor of law and history and a chair for the Concerned Faculty of USC, said anti-racism training for faculty and students is important in raising awareness around bias and harmful language. 
“When we talk to students about their experience, one of the first things people will talk about is better training, better anti-racism training,” Gross said. 
Gross mentioned the @Black_at_USC Instagram and the impact that microaggressions and racist comments have on students. While bias training is important, she emphasized that it isn’t enough.
She further explained that curriculum requirements should ensure that no USC student can graduate without an understanding of race and racism. 
“I’m a historian, I’d like to learn this history to know how we got here, to both learn about the history of these movements and struggles,” Gross said. “Black Lives Matter didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s building on the shoulders of all of these past movements. But also to understand where these structures came from, where this ideology comes from.”
Moving forward
Gross, along with other faculty members, is teaching classes that facilitate discourse around injustice and racism, specifically as it pertains to USC.
Gross and Sam Erman, a professor of law, are teaching a research seminar for graduate students focusing on the history of discrimination at USC. Students are creating scalar projects that detail instances of racism and discrimination by the University throughout different time periods. This course will be taught at the undergraduate level next year. 
“There are a number of these initiatives around the University, so students and faculty are already starting to do this work, even though the administration is kind of lagging behind,” Gross said. “But the history committee report, which is just being finished, will be calling on the University to kind of take up that mantle and do this work and take ownership over that history.”
Despite the opportunity for an ethnic studies requirement to provide a space where power structures rooted in whiteness, violence and exploitation are addressed, some students feel curriculum isn’t the most efficient channel to inform students. 
“As students, when we’re in a class, when it’s a required class not one that we necessarily choose to be in, we take it without having a regard to actually maintain or retain the information provided to us,” said Zaria Kelley, a sophomore majoring in psychology and board member of the Black Student Assembly.
Rather than instituting a required course, Kelley emphasized the need for students to look to existing clubs and cultural centers on campus.  
“One of the biggest things is to listen to the voices of different clubs on campus, especially if they’re minority representative,” Kelley said. “I know that we have a lot of cultural centers on campus so the clubs associated with those or the centers themselves.”
While cultural centers and clubs provide a space for students to learn about topics and groups outside of their own identities, it’s important that students don’t center their voice over those who the space is created for, Kelley explained. 
Fliegel also echoed the importance of extending beyond curriculum to reduce harmful behavior and microaggressions on campus. He explained that collaborative experiences and interpersonal relationships among students are essential to creating an inclusive community. 
“You kind of discover on an experiential basis that some biases that you may have been raised with, coming from outside, don’t bear up and you begin to change your personal feelings about other people, and that I think is something that happens in social contexts,” Fliegel said.  
An ethnic studies program, that could foster greater racial consciousness, sensitivity and understanding could facilitate necessary discourse around power and prejudice, consequently creating a student body better prepared to understand and combat injustice after college. 
“A curricular requirement in ethnic studies, or the equivalent, would be extremely important in telling students that part of what it means to be a resident or a citizen of this country is to be cognizant of how crucial inequality — especially inequality around race, class, gender — has been fundamental to this country,” Nguyen said.

In any other year, orchestra members could be seen seated in a semicircle formation in a theater or auditorium, decked out in their formal, black attire, with instruments in hand and ready to perform for a live audience. Now, from one’s phone screen, audiences can see each musician performing in bubbles floating across a starry sky, playing against the backdrop of a moonlit lake and other unique visuals and animations. This is how USC’s Student Symphony Orchestra has made its transition to digital performances.
SSO is the University’s student-led interdisciplinary orchestra and has continued showcasing their music throughout the pandemic, with a lineup of performances and concerts continuing into the spring.
The group was founded 10 years ago under the name Concerto Chamber Orchestra and now boasts a group of over 100 members representing 40 majors across USC’s campus and includes a wind section alongside its core chamber orchestra. According to music director Adam Karelin, the majority of its members are non-music majors, which comprise over 70% of the orchestra. 
Elaine Huang, a senior majoring in human biology who serves as the orchestra’s president, said she was initially drawn to the orchestra specifically because of the accessibility and flexibility it offered students. 
“To find a student-led orchestra where our goal was to continue making music as a community regardless of your background … was a really great opportunity for me,” Huang said. “We pride ourselves in making music as accessible as possible.”
This semester, the group has continued producing their artistic work. Huang said their focus going into this 10th anniversary season was essentially to celebrate the people behind the orchestra and its growth over the past year. Music director Adam Karelin said that SSO has enjoyed its most successful season yet.
“We had the highest membership in our history, and the highest viewership in our history because of this digital platform,” Karelin said. “One of our videos from last summer just broke 20,000 views on YouTube. We were never getting that kind of audience retention before the pandemic.” 
SSO has also done more collaborations this year, working in tandem with the USC Chamber Ballet Company, the Aquarium of the Pacific and dancers from USC’s Kaufman School of Dance. 
“The three big values that we wanted to push into the next chapter of SSO’s life [are] engaging visual production, diversified repertoire and external collaborations,” Karelin said. 
On March 21, they premiered their Shostakovich Piano Concerto performance, a project done in partnership with Cal State Fullerton animator Tracey Muy and Thornton graduate student and pianist Wayne Yang. As the orchestra began the recording process, SSO worked with Muy to create visual elements to accompany the performance’s release on social media, Huang said. 
“We had a skeleton that we were able to give her,” Huang said. “As she continued animating we were able to get the rest of our musicians fully recorded to put together the piece.” 
Although an animator was brought in for this project, Karelin said the visuals are typically created by SSO’s own video production team. General members help dictate what the visual elements will look like and choose what best fits the atmosphere of the piece.
“In the Mary Lou Williams ‘Zodiac Suite,’ it’s very clear that you’re going to have images involving stars and each of the Zodiac signs,” Karelin said. “It’s not as clear, for example, when you’re doing the Shostakovich [piece] what the imagery should be. It’s really exciting to see the kinds of images that people have in their minds, and finding a collective consensus on what the orchestra members want to see.”
The Shostakovich performance is driven by a solo section played by Yang. It was Yang and his piano instructor, Professor of Practice Bernadene Blaha, who originally approached SSO with this piece. Vice president Linda Diaz, a junior majoring in composition, noted that the orchestra was especially moved by Yang’s musical talent in the face of a disability.
“Despite not having a left hand, he’s still able to play this concerto and play it immensely beautifully,” Diaz said. Yang not only contributed as a performer, but was a member of the production team behind this project. 
Huang cites the Shostakovich performance as one of her favorite projects the orchestra has undertaken. 
“It was just so gorgeous every single time I was recording it,” Huang said. “There’s just so many beautiful moments in that piece.”
SSO has also worked to honor the music of historically overlooked artists such as Joseph Bologne, a Black French composer. Bologne’s music was often neglected as a result of anti-Black racism that has been pervasive throughout the history of classical music, Karelin said.
“Bologne is often deliberately left out of concert halls and deliberately left out of history books because he was Black,” said Karelin, noting that much of much of the innovation in music Bologne made during his lifetime ended up being posthumously credited to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by historians. “We really want to share his work with the world.” 
SSO featured Bologne’s Symphony No. 2 last Fall and released the first of a three week series on April 3. The final two installments will be premiered in the upcoming weekends. 
Their final concert, capping off the orchestra’s 10th anniversary season, is slated to be on May 1, where the rest of their projects are to be released on social media. It will highlight two world premieres, including one from James Madison University junior Joe Jaxson. His original full-orchestra piece, “Fanfare and Overture,” was selected out of the many submissions SSO received when they hosted their annual worldwide call for scores in the summer. The second premiere is from SSO’s own representative for music majors, Aidan Gold, performing an original percussion concerto based on music from Turkmenistan.  
“[Gold’s] piece was actually slated to premiere last season and got cancelled because of [the coronavirus],” Karelin said. “So it’s really exciting to close our final concert this season with finally premiering that piece.”
The event will also feature a collaboration with the Thornton Jazz Orchestra under director Bob Mintzer, a Grammy Award-winning saxophonist. Another project in preparation for months, Thornton’s orchestra recorded their sections last semester, and as SSO recorded their respective parts this semester, the project can finally come together. According to Huang, this concert in particular will be especially reflective of the orchestra’s endurance through the pandemic. 
“It’s the culmination of a very turbulent but growth centered year,” Huang said. “We really did our best to continue music making afloat throughout the pandemic. Rather than settling for less we kind of found our own way to take our situation and create our own spin in it.”
Beyond the main features, the concert will include renditions of Duke Ellington’s “Caravan” and Count Basie’s “April in Paris.”
Although audiences will not get to experience an in-person performance in the Bovard Auditorium this semester, the orchestra members look forward to it nevertheless, Diaz said.
“We’re really excited to be putting on this concert,” Diaz said. “There are so many people working behind the scenes … to continue [making music] no matter what.”

After a tough finish to 2020, USC is hoping it can make some noise this coming college football season. With spring practice kicking off just two weeks ago, a question the Trojans face this season is how the offensive line will hold up. 
Star offensive lineman Alijah Vera-Tucker declared for the NFL draft, making an already depleted offensive line desperate for more experience. They’ll look to lean on more experienced offensive lineman such as redshirt seniors Jalen McKenzie and Liam Jimmons to find some continuity at left tackle. 
On Tuesday, there were moments when the offensive line would collapse for a few snaps, then hold its ground to protect junior quarterback Kedon Slovis. Finding consistency is what head coach Clay Helton is looking for. 
However, Helton isn’t guaranteeing any starting spots on the offensive line heading into the season. Helton said he plans on moving around the offensive tackles and guards to establish familiarity in different positions and see what works best. 
It’s a process Helton feels comfortable with, and one he is not afraid to use all 15 spring practices to figure out, as well as some of training camp in the fall.
“Alijah [Vera-Tucker] was best at left tackle for us on our team [last year]. He was the best one for us at that moment, so that’s what we’re trying to find right now,” Helton said in a virtual press conference Saturday. “And it takes more than just two weeks [of practice]. You want to put kids in different positions, see how it relates to them and then make the best decisions for our team.”
Providing lineman an opportunity to improve and fight for playing time in spring practice is crucial in protecting Slovis, as well as establishing a consistent run game. 
The gunslinging quarterback had an inconsistent 2020 season, throwing for 1,921 yards, 17 touchdowns and seven interceptions over six games.
The run game struggled too, only reaching a total of 584 yards over the same span — good enough for the lowest per-game rushing average in the Pac-12. The addition of Texas transfer senior Keaontay Ingram, as well as the return of senior running backs Vavae Malepeai and Stephen Carr, offer reason to be optimistic this season.
Following last season’s struggles on the ground, Helton emphasized his desire to create a run game USC can rely on. 
“We’d love to have a guy that can touch the ball anywhere from 22, 25 times the game and a second guy come in that is able to spell him with 12-15 touches,” Helton said. “And so we’re searching for that. It’s a highly competitive room; it’s a talented room right now and it’s fun to watch.”
On the other side of the ball, the Trojans hope the defensive line will prove to be a dominant front. 
It’s an experienced group with redshirt seniors Brandon Pili and Caleb Tremblay returning along with juniors Drake Jackson and Jacob Lichtenstein. All four caused havoc in practice Tuesday, setting the tone for a defense hoping to build on last season’s successes.
Helton had high praise for an unfamiliar name — 6-foot-3 325-pound freshman defensive lineman Jay Toia. 
“A mountain of a man, biggest head I’ve ever seen. Head like an elephant,” Helton said Saturday. “Having watched him practice, I love his competitiveness; I love his coachability… he has a bright future at USC.”
There’s plenty of room to improve though, as Helton said he specifically wants to see better third-down efficiency from the defense. This scenario was extensively practiced toward the end of practice Tuesday, with the defense recording multiple short-yardage stops.  
USC will play its Spring Showcase at the Coliseum this Saturday at 1 p.m.

As we approach the end of the collegiate sports season, especially with the “madness” of the men’s and women’s NCAA basketball tournaments, I wanted to shift gears to talk about growing concerns for youth sports. 
With vaccination efforts increasing every day and President Biden’s announcement that all adults will be eligible for a vaccine by next week, things are hopefully heading back to normalcy. Even in Los Angeles this week, vaccine appointments have been opened for people age 16 and older. 
So, due to the growth in accessibility of vaccinations, many community areas and group activities are gradually beginning to reopen, thinking it is safe to do so. While I do agree restrictions can be slowly relaxed, there needs to be caution taken by those making such decisions.  
All over the country, schools have been restarting in-person learning and youth sports are being played fully again. Though there have been focused efforts to get teachers, administration and community members vaccinated, many adolescents are still unable to do so, since the vaccine is only approved for people 16 and older. When kids are playing basketball, soccer or any other sport with others involved, they can still transmit the virus. 
The reason why this topic came to my interest, even though I mainly cover professional and collegiate sports, is because of the numerous reports coming out across the country about cases rising again despite the vaccine rollout, with many pointing to youth sports as part of the issue. 
The CDC has found that the B.1.1.7 variant of the virus, first found in the United Kingdom, is increasing in both Michigan and Minnesota. For example, in March, this new strain was found within 68 cases related to school/club sports in Carver County, Min. 
The CDC director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, voiced her concerns on how current youth sports regulations are a potential reason why there is a resurgence in cases in these states as well as the country in general.
“In [Michigan and Minnesota], there is concern about transmission in youth sports, both club sports as well as sports affiliated in school,” Dr. Walensky said in a news briefing at the White House. “I would advocate for a sort of stronger mitigation strategies… [to] decrease the community activity and shore up mask wearing.”
Due to this increase in cases, state officials are having to restrict activities once again. Michigan is leading the country with a case rate of 452.5 cases per 100,000 people. The state’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is asking for in-person sports to pause all activities for two weeks as well as schools to offer remote education for two weeks after spring break so cases can drop again. 
It seems that in such states, where lawmakers are eager to get things back to normal, they are not considering the consequences such swift changes will cause. Even though vaccines are starting to become available to most adults, that does not mean that everyone is vaccinated yet. In fact, only 22.3% of the country is fully vaccinated so far. 
Additionally, having the vaccine doesn’t mean you are completely immune to the coronavirus. None of the “big 3” vaccines in the United States: Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, have a 100% efficacy rate, so there is still some risk attached to youth sports even with the vaccine.
Similar to what we are seeing in Michigan and Minnesota, it is imperative that other states and the nation as a whole do not speed up the process of returning back to normalcy, especially with youth sports. Although both states have major cities such as Detroit and Minneapolis, if a similar trend occurs in larger cities like L.A., health officials and the government may have to start issuing restrictions again. 
Currently, L.A. County is starting to reopen indoor sports and activities for both youth and adults. The main additional step that the county is taking, which can help curb any potential cases, is making these indoor sports adhere to collegiate requirements. 
College sports require regular testing. With so many people participating in these indoor sports, these testing requirements can help limit the spread of the virus, so that we do not witness another resurgence of cases and restrictions. 
With vaccinations increasing every day, we are getting closer and closer to the finish line, but we cannot stumble by reopening activities like youth sports too quickly.

Today, I want to talk about the gravest threat to the children. I don’t mean the crisis at the border, or the school shootings or the rising concerns around mental health. I mean the rise of Satanic propaganda in pop culture. That’s right, I am talking about Lil Nas X dancing on the devil’s lap.
Now, just imagine if this was an actual argument put forth by this column. But if you actually wanted to hear this sort of argument, you would need to look no further than the backlash against Lil Nas X since the release of his “MONTERO (Call Me by Your Name)” music video a few weeks ago. 
In the video, Lil Nas X slides down to hell on a pole and gives the devil a lap dance. As you could imagine, conservatives were enraged. They deemed the video sacrilegious and  inappropriate for children. One Twitter user even tweeted, “The system is targeting kids.” Simply put, they want to protect the children from it.
But this backlash isn’t about protecting the children. For instance, radio stations frequently broadcast songs about having sex like animals and snorting cocaine. As a concept, “children” easily default as an emotionally-charged and nearly indisputable political maneuver for the right. Whether the controversy be over homoeroticism, coronavirus restrictions or women’s bodies, children are just the most convenient scapegoat for bigotry.
Unsurprisingly, the right still has a problem with homosexuality and sexual liberation. Just as with Lil Nas X, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion experienced this same outcry after the release of “WAP,” because how dare they release a hypersexual anthem after women’s bodies have been historically hypersexualized? How dare Lil Nas X turn the condemnation of homosexuality by religious groups into art? 
To contextualize this paradigm, it also occurs with Black men who embrace “gangsta culture.” Black men are stereotyped as criminals so they eventually start to possess these stereotypes as a coping mechanism. In fact, psychologists posit that embracing one’s stigmatized identity is a powerful coping strategy when they feel hopelessly isolated. The n-word was used as a slur by the dominant caste, but Black people took it back; similarly, gay people took back “faggot.” 
So, when Lil Nas X slid down the pole to hell, he possessed the religious persecution of his identity and made a statement against this power hierarchy that pits homosexuality below the Christian majority. It’s a means of empowerment and coping against repression and stigma. But it seems as if marginalized communities can never win — they hate us on Earth and they hate us when we, literally, go to hell. 
Meanwhile, Rep. Matt Gaetz, who voted against a revenge porn bill in Florida that would prevent people from sharing explicit photos of ex-lovers, is currently being investigated for having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old and sharing photos of nude women with fellow lawmakers. Protecting the children would involve actually holding rapists and child predators, such as Gaetz, accountable. 
It would also involve removing politicians, such as those who believe that rape and incest are “God’s will,” from office. Should I even mention the Roman Catholic Church’s mishandling of the child sex abuse scandal? I hate that it needs to be said, but predators and rapists — not homosexuality and women’s bodies — harm children. 
Naturally, bigotry seeps into harmful policies that — you guessed it — harm the children. “Protecting the children” obviously only applies to those who are straight, cisgender and white because the Arkansas legislature passed a bill to prohibit gender-confirming treatments or surgery for transgender children. 
The religious right continually seeks to prohibit gay couples from adopting children, despite the foster system being overcrowded and thousands of children aging out of it before being adopted. And the border crisis, which is by no means a sole result of Republican policies, separates children from their parents and houses them in detention centers — as of Mar. 21, there are more than 15,500 unaccompanied children in Customs and Border Patrol custody. 
The right also weaponizes “protecting the children” to protest coronavirus safety restrictions — ironically, the same ones that are in place to protect their children, especially the ones who are immunocompromised. Nationwide, protestors advocate that children need to be back in school because of education inequality and mental health challenges without sports and activities. However, as I have mentioned in previous columns, the solution isn’t compromising coronavirus safety protocols. 
Because the pandemic simply exposed the education system’s structural flaws, the solution would involve addressing the reasons why students have inadequate access to resources at home and why their parents and teachers are struggling to support them. As long as teachers remain underpaid and underappreciated, they should not have to compromise their safety to teach before they are vaccinated. Protecting the children means supporting the environment that educates them — that means advocating for teachers as well as students. 
Ultimately, “protecting the children” will remain an empty, age-old adage unless people relinquish their embedded prejudice. If they want the kids to have their sports seasons, maybe they should support their teachers in efforts for pay raises. If they really have a problem with Lil Nas X giving the devil a lap dance, maybe they shouldn’t have told the kids that gay people are going to hell. If they really have a problem with WAP, maybe they should’ve taught their sons to not objectify women’s bodies in the first place. 
Instead of focusing on how we need to protect the children, it’s time to focus on how we endangered them in the first place.

The coronavirus has disturbed nearly every aspect of normal life — from college to travel and grocery shopping. USC has taken unprecedented steps during the pandemic, including moving classes online, introducing  summer scholarships and reorganizing housing. One decision, trading a traditional spring break for five wellness days, has been especially controversial. 
On Oct. 14, 2020, USC issued a statement announcing wellness days. The University claims the change is necessary to “minimize the risk of the virus spreading due to travel.” Wellness days are days where there are “no classes and no classwork is expected of students.”
There was an initial pushback on this decision. Now, over halfway through spring semester and actually having experienced these wellness days, students are extremely dissatisfied with USC’s decision. Their dissatisfaction is twofold: 1) wellness days do not “minimize the risk of the virus” as promised and 2) wellness days do not provide the same level of relaxation as a traditional spring break.
Students are not seeing the lack of a spring break as an actual deterrent to travel. With the online semester, students are able to travel anytime, anywhere, while taking classes. People are determined to travel, with or without a spring break. USC reported coronavirus cases are not significantly decreasing in comparison to other universities that kept their spring break. 
University of California, Berkeley retained its spring break, letting their students rest. In late January, there were an average of 15 positive student cases a day at USC and 25 positive student cases a day at Berkeley. Now, there are an average of six positive student cases a day at USC and two positive student cases a day at Berkeley. Even though Berkeley kept its spring break, their infection rates are improving much faster than ours. Although there may be other factors, this suggests that USC’s wellness days are not actually preventing the spread of the coronavirus. 
Wellness days are not only unhelpful, but they actually harm students. Some professors are unresponsive to wellness days, assigning pre-recorded lectures and homework. Most notably, many students are forced to do lab work while on a wellness day. Many science classes have a lab schedule where students are distributed throughout the week. Therefore, having one lab section take a day off is impossible since the students in sections on other days are forced to still complete the lab. This contradiction is especially concerning, since USC claimed to work with “academic schools and administrative units across campus” to organize wellness days. Yet, they failed to address such a common phenomenon in some of the largest schools on campus, such as Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and Viterbi School of Engineering.
Unlike spring break, wellness days do not slow the speed of a class schedule. With upcoming due dates and midterms, students feel the psychological pressure to use wellness days to catch up to speed in their classes. Therefore, many spend this “break” just as they would any other weekday. One wellness day is not equivalent to one day during spring break. While students are scrambling to complete pre-recorded lectures and assignments on a wellness day, students from other schools get to take a true break from Zoom. 
Ultimately, USC’s decision to replace spring break with wellness days was not only ineffective in stopping the spread of coronavirus, but also took away a much needed break from an insane semester. There is simply no upside to their decision.
