If you’ve been watching USC’s defense this season, you’ve probably heard this sound more often than any other: whiff!
That’s the sound of the Trojans tackling, or at least attempting to do so. If defense is USC’s greatest weakness, tackling is the most troublesome part of the equation. If USC’s defense is anything like Achilles, the inability to tackle is its heel.
The Trojans’ trouble with bringing opponents to the ground has plagued them all year, and they’ve given up monster games to athletic offenses. It started with Hawai’i’s 588-yard eye-opening bombardment, and was finally confirmed when Washington dogged the Trojans for 537 yards and handed them their first loss of the season.
Needing assistance - USC has elected to not tackle in practice, leaving the Trojans to fend for themselvs in game situations. The decision came as a result of a lack of depth on the Trojans' roster, and its effects have been evident on the defensive side of the ball so far this season. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
Especially glaring was when a few USC players whiffed on Washington running back Chris Polk’s long run that put his team in field-goal range during the Huskies’ game-winning drive.
It is well known by now that the Trojans don’t go live in practice. They try to keep everyone on their feet in hopes of limiting injuries as much as possible in an already-depleted squad.
So with the Trojans’ defensive shortcomings finally biting them last Saturday, is it time to start tackling in practice? That should fix everything, right?
Wrong. It still wouldn’t be worth the risk.
It has been USC coach Lane Kiffin’s strategy since the middle of fall practice, and it is still a logical one. Sanctions equal fewer players, which means a team that has less tolerance for injuries that don’t happen on game day.
USC senior cornerback Shareece Wright understands the toll the game takes on players’ bodies. Regardless of the Trojans’ obvious issues on Saturdays, Wright still supports Kiffin’s no-tackle policy.
“We can’t go live [in practice]; we’d all be banged up,” Wright said after the Washington loss.
The problem is not even one of technique, but one of mentality.
“I feel we’re trying to kill people and trying to take kill shots,” Wright said.
Instead of making the sure hit, USC is looking for the big hit. If ever there were a season when being fancy was meaningless, this is it.
It’s not that veteran guys, such as Wright or senior linebacker Michael Morgan, forgot how to tackle. They are just as capable of tackling without beating one another up every day in practice.
It’s a question of rhythm.
The difference between a tackle and a whiff is a split second of timing picked up through repetition on the practice field.
USC used to have so much depth that its two-deep roster could probably field two separate competitive football teams. Practices were fast-paced. The Trojans were encouraged to hit one another, with vicious hits regularly eliciting oohs and ahs from spectators.
Unfortunately, USC no longer has that luxury.
The Trojans could start going live in practice, and you would probably see measurable improvement in tackling. Still, the potential cost would be too great.
USC is so thin in its front seven that redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo played snaps at defensive end last Saturday to give the fatigued defensive linemen a break. Inevitably, the chances that a starter gets injured goes way up if he is hitting or taking hits in practice.
Undoubtedly, tackling is a key issue in these huge defensive letdowns. But let’s not kid ourselves. It’s not the only problem.
Even if Kiffin were willing to take the risk in practice, fixing the tackling issue would only go so far. The Trojan defense is often out of position. It is largely inexperienced. It is not very deep.
So although tackling in practice appears to be a quick fix, the Trojans’ problems run much deeper. And Kiffin has to do all he can to keep the Trojans as healthy as possible in a forum where he can control it.
As long as the Trojans have reduced numbers that prevent them from going live in practice, the whiffs will keep coming.

Those worried that the No. 2 USC women’s golf team would be undone by the youth on its roster might have been a bit surprised at Monday’s results.
Firing away · Freshman Sophia Popov led the Women of Troy Monday, posting a 4-under-par 68 as USC finished in second place. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
The Women of Troy, with two All-Americans and three members of last year’s NCAA runner-up team in their lineup, were led by a freshman at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational in Tacoma, Wash.
Sophia Popov, a native of Germany, fired a 4-under-par 68 to tie for first place after the opening round of the tournament. Popov is tied with Emily Childs and Joanne Lee of Cal, who represent the leading team in the tournament.
USC finished at 3-under-par 285, one stroke behind Cal and eight strokes ahead of Washington.
The Women of Troy are looking to overtake Cal for their first victory of the season, especially considering USC’s history of success at the invitational, where they have earned six individual titles and seven team titles.
But as USC coach Andrea Gaston pointed out, this history must be taken lightly, as only one USC golfer — senior Lizette Salas — has played there because of the team’s absence from the tournament for the past two seasons.
Popov had a consistently good round, with five birdies offset by 12 pars and only one bogey. Her second tournament for USC has already produced the first under-par round of her collegiate career.
Following the freshman’s lead Monday was Salas, who finished in a tie for seventh at 1-under-par 71 after posting three birdies and two bogeys. The senior was 1-under-par on the front nine but could not add to her tally  on the back nine, shooting even par.
Salas is looking to bounce back to top-10 form after a 21st-place finish at the 2010 Mason Rudolph Championship in Nashville, Tenn. last week.
Junior transfer Lisa McCloskey opened with an even-par 72 to tie for 15th. McCloskey has finished fourth in her two tournaments since transferring from Pepperdine, and led the Women of Troy at the Mason Rudolph Championship with a 7-under-par 209 performance.
McCloskey had a solid round for 17 holes, but a triple bogey on the 10th hole prevented her from breaking par for the day.
Junior Inah Park, in her second tournament of the season, tied for 31st at 2-over-par 74. She opened with four bogeys and no birdies on the front nine but closed with three birdies and one bogey on the back.
“She had a bit of trouble on the front nine getting her momentum,” Gaston said.
Rounding out the roster is sophomore Cyna Rodriguez, who is tied for 31st at 4-over-par 76. Rodriguez started with three bogeys on the front and could not offset them with her back nine of two bogeys and a birdie.
For the team to leave Tacoma with an eighth win, it will have to start their rounds stronger,  Gaston said.
“[We have to] try and get into a rhythm earlier on,” Gaston said. “We started slow today.”
The three-round tournament runs through Wednesday.

It was a familiar situation for the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team — a tournament against top-notch competition expected to provide an inexperienced Trojan team with a stifling challenge, a slate of games against schools all ranked in the top 10, and a situation in which a loss was more than simply a possibility.
Upward bound · Freshman driver Nikola Vavic scores a goal with 35 seconds left to play in the championship round to put the Trojans up 9-8 over the Bruins. The score stood, and USC went 4-0 this weekend to win the SoCal Tournament. - Courtney Sandlin | Daily Trojan
Yet, for the Trojans last week, all of these factors simply amounted to the title with which they have become so familiar — SoCal Tournament champions.
With a weekend roadtrip away from the friendly confines of McDonald’s Swim Stadium, USC (15-0, 1-0) posted yet another solid outing, with wins over Redlands (22-5), No. 8 Long Beach State (17-5), No. 6 UC Santa Barbara (7-6) and No. 2 UCLA (9-8) to capture the program’s eighth consecutive SoCal Tournament championship, held annually at UCLA’s Spieker Aquatics Center.
In fitting fashion, the Trojans finished their last challenge of the weekend with a win over crosstown rival UCLA, parlaying multi-goal outings from freshman two-meter Jeremy Davie and sophomore utility Mace Rapsey into a renewal of the tournament title they might as well be permanent owners of.
With USC holding an unfathomable streak of eight straight titles, the SoCal Tournament could easily be mistaken by outsiders to the program as a practice meet. But with all 10 and most of the top 20 teams in the nation competing annually, this is by no means the case.
And simply coasting to yet another tournament title was not an option for the top-ranked Trojans.
Despite holding a 6-3 lead midway through the third period against UCLA, USC surrendered several goals to the Bruins, eventually reaching an 8-8 knot late in the fourth quarter.
But seasoned junior goalie Joel Dennerley stopped two 5-meter penalty shots, giving the offense a chance to regain the lead. Freshman driver Nikola Vavic wasted no time in doing so, finding the net with 35 seconds remaining to cement the victory and USC’s third straight win over the Bruins.
Against UC Santa Barbara Sunday, the Trojans faced a similar late game challenge.
Despite holding a 4-1 lead after the first frame, the Gauchos crawled back with two second quarter goals to narrow the lead to just one at halftime.
“We missed quite a few easy opportunities, and that’s really what happened,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “We could have been up 8-1, but if you miss opportunities, you’re going to pay the price and that’s what happened.”
Things got slowly worse for USC as the defense surrendered two more Gaucho goals, placing the Trojans in a 5-4 hole before entering the fourth quarter.
“We had quite a few shots that missed,” coach Vavic said. “It was just one of those games where the ball didn’t want to go in.”
But fortunately for the Trojans, things changed.
In the fourth quarter, USC notched three goals to cement a 7-6 win, largely because of the play of Davie — who finished with two scores — and Nikola Vavic.
“They’re both really tough and have been huge for us, especially at the end of the game where it was real close,” Jovan Vavic said.
In the closing seconds, Nikola Vavic found Davie on a counterattack and Davie’s game-winning shot with less than a minute to play gave the Trojans the lead and the win.
“We had Davie and a couple other players make a great counterattack and we were in countering really hard,” Jovan Vavic said. “The ball went to Nikola on the wing, he found Davie and gave him a really nice pass. He drew an ejection, and then Nikola gave him the ball right back and he scored the goal.”
Despite the struggle, the coach remained confident that his team performed well, considering the circumstances.
“In all three games, we gave up five, five and six goals, and that’s good,” coach Vavic said. “When you give up just five to six goals, you’re going to win quite a few games.”
Even in the events leading up to the Trojans’ evening showdown with their crosstown rivals, USC looked just as formidable, particularly in the team’s Saturday contests against Redlands and Long Beach State.
“In both of those games, it was really a team effort,” Jovan Vavic said. “We got off to a good start and never really let up. We really stayed focused and finished our shots.”
Against Redlands, 13 USC players notched at least one goal, and in the second matchup with Long Beach State, 13 players found their way onto the scoresheet as well.
Scoring came early and often. In both contests, the Trojans worked their way to leads in the opening minutes, holding halftime leads of 10-1 and 9-2, in which victories were all but assured.
With four victories this weekend, USC prolongs its reign atop the SoCal Tournament hierarchy, a position it has held since 2003. And if their success in this preseason tournament is any indication, the Trojans are not done winning just yet.

Life As We Know It is a new kind of romantic comedy in that it is actually what it claims to be: comedic.
The plot, though based on the generic format of any other film in the rom-com genre, is fresh enough to capture its audience and funny enough to keep it laughing.
Holly Berenson (Katherine Heigl) and Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel) are set up on a blind date at the start of the movie, and it is quickly made clear that they are two very different people. Despite their mutual wish to never see each other again, the pair are continually thrown together in the coming years as a result of mutual friends.
When confronted with the task of raising their friends’ daughter, Sophie, after a traumatic accident, they have to learn not only how to live together under one roof but also how to become parents. Though the plot does progress, it is the characters, their relationships and the comedy that make this movie a must-see.
Following the introductory date scene, the title sequence rolls with a collage of mock home videos of the friends, highlighting their lives, experiences, arguments and mutual festivities. Immediately the audience connects with the characters. Though Duhamel and Heigl’s acting isn’t anything better than what we’ve seen in the past from these two, it is definitely of higher quality than most movies of this genre. Duhamel and Heigl are unbelievably charismatic and charming when put together in a scene.
They are also quite believable in their roles: Heigl as a put-together workaholic with relationship issues and Duhamel as a sports fanatic and carefree ladies man. The two leads work very well together, and their natural chemistry has the audience praying for them to have their own happily-ever-after, even before this idea is presented as a possibility
Unfortunately, as it seems all chick flicks must, there is no shortage of corny scenes in this movie. The writers even go so far as to include the classic airport scene, where one character sprints down the terminal to stop the other from getting on the plane, only to find the plane has already departed.
What this movie has that its predecessors have lacked, however, is the redemptive touch of comedic relief. It is as if the writers knew just how cheesy they were being, and whenever it got too over the top, they threw a few more jokes the audience’s way. In the airport scene, for example, the caseworker sent to judge whether Eric and Holly are fit to be parents tags along. She yells fractious comments to the workers at airport security and cries over Holly’s inevitable unhappiness, effectively lightening the mood and distracting from the overdramatic action taking place at the forefront of the scene.
Life As We Know It is filled with a number of incredibly entertaining and hysterical moments from start to finish. Though there are lots of laughs to be had, there are also some less-than-funny scenes as well — you might tear up early on when Sophie’s parents die. Some might even tear up when they see Eric and Holly separate over issues ranging from raising Sophie to Holly’s new love interest, Sam (Josh Lucas).
Whether the audience likes Josh Lucas’ character or not, his part in the movie is nonetheless disposable. Even though his character is charming, sweet, good with kids, a doctor — seemingly the perfect guy — in classic genre fashion, the tropes of the film win out. Viewers will find themselves sucked into the lives of these characters, hoping against all realistic hope and all notions of practicality that the two leads find each other again.
Life As We Know It has its high and low points, as most movies do. Despite the cheesiness and overuse of some lines, this movie is still one for the masses. Everyone in the theater will be laughing through the whole of the movie, sometimes even for so long that they miss the next joke.
There is humor, drama, character growth, love, loss and outstanding actors — everything needed to make it the blockbuster hit that, if nothing else, its humor deserves.

Tamara Drewe offers a remedy for writers afflicted with boredom and heartache: adultery, and lots of it. Director Stephen Frears (The Queen) returns to High Fidelity territory with his latest outing. Here, instead of John Cusack as a lovelorn DJ in Chicago, Gemma Arterton (Quantum of Solace) stars as the titular journalist who returns home to the sleepy British village Ewedown with a nose job and newfound sexual appeal.
Love affair · Gemma Arterton (above) stars as the title character Tamara Drewe, who returns to her hometown and ends up involved in the romantic relationships between her neighbors. - Photos courtesy of Sony PIctures Classics
She plans to sell her late mother’s house and enlists a local farmhand Andy (Luke Evans) to refurbish it. It’s a tall order for him: Tamara was his high school crush, and her home belonged to his family. He wants both back.
Tamara’s neighbors Nicholas and Beth Hardiment (Roger Allam and Tamsin Greig) employ Andy. They run a writers’ community where scribes come for some peace and quiet to accompany their procrastination. Among them is the American academic Glen (Bill Camp), who is writing a biography of British author Thomas Hardy who, like Nicholas, slept around a good bit.
Complicating the plot, as well as the intentions of anyone trying to explain this movie concisely, are the troublesome teenage girls obsessed with  rock star  Ben Sergeant (Dominic Cooper) who woos Tamara.
The plot revolves around affairs, lost loves, heartbreaks and teenage crushes that make what would otherwise be a boring place quite scandalous.
While the multitude of characters would suggest a grand novel as its source, Tamara Drewe was actually inspired by a comic strip of the same name, which in turn was a modern reimagining of Thomas Hardy’s novel Far From the Madding Crowd.
Moira Buffini’s script weaves the lives of all the characters into an impressive tapestry. All films about writers face the challenge of how to get around the writing, since it’s dull to watch someone sit at a computer and work. Worse yet, many films over emphasize the writers’ struggle with their craft. Buffini and Frears step away from that. Instead, they find humor and fun in the characters and the romances that blossom among them.
Like most movies based on comic books, however, the film version of Tamara Drewe feels a little abbreviated. The writers at the colony are a colorful lot, but most disappear as soon as the history of Nicholas and Beth is unvealed — he’s the author of a successful crime series, she’s the underappreciated wife largely responsible for his success.
The same goes for Andy. He has as much to lose as anyone else, yet he takes a back seat to Tamara, Glen and the Hardiments. Though his effect on the story remains large, his time on screen shrinks as the story goes on. In a world of colorful characters, his is flat and his absence dilutes the final act of the movie.
That’s not to say Evans’ performance hurts the film. He holds his own among celebrities like Cooper and Arterton and thespian heavyweights like Allam.
Arterton especially shines as Tamara. Frears is adept at capturing strong female leads, and Arterton possesses the confidence and sensitivity of Tamara. In flashbacks when a younger Tamara still sports a huge proboscis, Arterton delivers the necessary youthfulness. In the present, she moves from being tough to flirty to conflicted in moments. It’s a fun role for a young actress, and Arterton brings some necessary depth to Tamara.
The depth is necessary because the heart of the movie lies not with her, but with Beth and Glen. It’s the life they bring to each other that makes much of the film fun, and they steal much of the attention away from Tamara’s story and ultimately drive the plot.
As Glen, Camp rises above his cast. Glen could easily have been pompous and dour, but instead Camp imbues him with the upbeat uncertainty of a bored teenager.
Given its autumn release, Frears and company are probably looking for some Oscar attention — although the most refreshing part of that movie might be that it’s not obviously aiming for awards. Although it could garner nods for Buffini, Evans, Arterton and Frears, it will likely be remembered as a fun, light romance that doesn’t take itself too seriously.

Since 1996, Scottish indie-pop band Belle & Sebastian has grown from a modest success to what some critics call the next classic voice in rock music. Frequently lauded as a modern-day version of The Smiths, Belle & Sebastian have released eight full-length albums as well as dozens of other EPs, compilations, film scores, DVDs and songbooks.
Belle & Sebastian played a show in Los Angeles on Sunday night to a sold-out crowd at the newly remodeled Hollywood Palladium to promote their new album, Belle & Sebastian Write About Love.
Justin Beltz | Daily Trojan
Currently composed of seven members and fronted by lead vocalist Stuart Murdoch, Belle & Sebastian continue to refine their distinct sound of jubilant chord progressions with wistful harmonizing on Write About Love. And although often criticized for a lack of musical variety, the arrival and enthusiastic reception of the album proves that sometimes more of the same means more of the same brilliance.
The packed-to-the-walls audience at the concert consisted of fans old and young dancing to the tunes of the unreleased album while simultaneously chanting the lyrics to old favorites from as far back as the Tigermilk era in the ’90s.
After the low-fi collaboration Jenny & Johnny opened to excited applause, Belle & Sebastian took the stage and started off with the eponymous single, “Write About Love.” Though not present at the concert, English actress Carey Mulligan is featured on the funky album version with signature melancholic lyrics such as I hate my job, I’m working way too much / (Every day I’m stuck in an office) / At one o’clock, I take my lunch up on the roof / The city’s right below, I’ll ride upon a friend / He’s intellectual and he’s hot, but he understands.
Vocalist Sarah Martin filled in for Mulligan, while also contributing parts on the flute, keyboard, fiddle and percussion.
The concert shifted into more classical territory as the band knocked out the well-known singles from its lengthy oeuvre, such as “Step Into My Office, Baby,” “I’m A Cuckoo” and “Piazza, New York Catcher” — all to overwhelming applause.
Since Write About Love will not officially be released until Oct. 12, Murdoch addressed the audience each time the band was about to play an unfamiliar song so everyone could learn how to actively participate.  A particular favorite from the show off the new album was “I Want the World to Stop,” featuring the lead vocals of guitarist Stevie Jackson that re-introduced the crisp and progressive sound most commonly associated with the album Dear Catastrophe Waitress. Jenny Lewis of Jenny & Johnny made her second appearance on stage, contributing vocals to a special song request from one of the audience members.
An hour into the set, Murdoch brought up a handful of eager fans in the audience to dance on stage for “Sukie in the Graveyard” and “The Boy with the Arab Strap,” knighting each one with personalized Arab straps, devices to maintain an erection, at the very end, and then sang a version of “Happy Birthday” to two of the fans. In between songs, Murdoch humbly thanked the audience for its support and shared his personal anecdotes about traffic tickets, a strange visit to Las Vegas and the cultural differences between the audiences in the United States and Asia, which he saw while touring the world for the group’s new album.
The concert wrapped up perfectly with an extended version of “Sleep the Clock Around,” an older and underrated classic, and then the band came back for an encore with “Me and the Major.”
Although most of the audience members dressed and evoked the personas of modest librarians, there was not a single person in the entire building who was not dancing maniacally with cheesy, lovesick grins spread across his face.
Though Belle & Sebastian have produced more albums already than most successful mainstream superstars, there is no way their ever-expanding fan base will diminish in the near future. The band is set to play a special concert at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery today
With Write About Love appearing to be another instant classic, it’s safe to say that Belle & Sebastian will be around for a long time.
Just a correction: Belle & Sebastian didn’t open the show with “Write About Love”; in fact, they didn’t perform “Write About Love” at all. They opened with “I Didn’t See It Coming,” the first song on the new album.

Richard Outten, professional screenwriter and USC alumnus, would not be among the handful of fantasy scribes that the average moviegoer associates with big-budget studio pictures. He has worked consistently since his first sale but is unlikely to market himself based on prestige or public demand in the way that Eric Roth, David Koepp or Akiva Goldsman tend to.
Nevertheless, despite a layer of obscurity, Outten has enjoyed an extended career in film and television, writing for major studios and Academy Award-winning directors. Now, with another major studio picture entering the production phase this year, Outten could be the sleeper hit of his profession.
After earning his master in fine arts degree from the Peter Stark Producing Program in 1984, Outten was hired by Oscar-winning director Franklin J. Schaffner (Planet of The Apes, Patton, Papillion) to pen the script for Lionheart, thereby securing Outten’s status as a studio-worthy screenwriter. He then went on to co-write the Miyazaki-esque Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland with Chris Columbus and do uncredited work on the Gremlins sequel at the request of Steven Spielberg.
“I sold my first script, the sixth one I’d written, to a major producer two months after graduating from USC,” Outten said. “Since then, I’ve been fortunate to make a comfortable living scripting projects for the major studios and networks, which has allowed me to focus singularly on my writing career.”
Throughout his career, which is still very much alive, Outten has negotiated 25 writing deals, including a sequel to The Goonies, which remains unproduced. He has also ventured into television, writing scripts for Tales From The Crypt as well as shows for Fox and CBS.
Although he is still more of an under-the-radar success, Outten’s Mysterious Travels was recently acquired by Walden Media and New Line Cinema, for release in 2011 by Warner Brothers as the sequel to Journey To The Center of The Earth, which grossed more than $240 million internationally. The film stars the venerable Michael Caine and might serve to kickstart a new and fruitful era in Outten’s already admirable career.
“Writing for me is like breathing. If you’re truly engaged, I think it’s impossible to shut down the creative process,” Outten said.
Despite Outten’s laundry list of achievements, his true relevance to USC students comes in the form of connections; personal and lifelong connections that he made with colleagues on this campus.
“The [Peter Stark Producing] program gave me access to motion picture professionals who would later play a role in my career,” Outten said. “My classmates and fellow alumni are friends and colleagues to this day.”
The idea that the people we meet in college are the ones that determine our course has become somewhat of an orientation cliché for incoming freshmen. We are told time and again that our personal networks give us staying power in the working world, especially given high turnover in cinematic realms. In the case of Outten, USC was and is the greatest investment he ever made.
“In some way or another, I can trace the majority of the 25 writing deals I’ve made over the years to relationships that developed directly or indirectly as a result of studying cinema at USC,” Outten said.
So how do we personalize this fact and implement it in our four fleeting years here? We must first learn to balance proactive networking with openness. This is to say that the most profound connections are often made arbitrarily. No network is developed without effort, but we must also remain open to the possibility of making a connection anywhere and with anyone.
It is not always at the exclusive mixers or the Sundance pre-screenings that business relationships are forged. More often than not, enormous success stories begin on that random film class set or in a coffee shop years later.
The danger in viewing the college world through this lens, however, is to render every connection a business connection. The best business relationships begin with a mutual compulsion to work together, to create something of worth. Within this relationship is a shared belief in one another. The relationships are not mergers, which are calculated efforts to consolidate power. The types of connections that you want to make in college transcend financial matters and begin with respect, admiration and hopefully, friendship.
When we come to college, there is an expectation that we will find a mirror of ourselves. We hope for colleagues who will echo our passions, which can only encourage and inspire us to be better at what we do. But in doing so, we also narrow our understanding of the world and those with whom we share it.
Whether we learn about an international student’s culture, someone’s tragic loss, a roommate’s game-winning touchdown or a neighbor’s summer trip to Spain, we are growing not just as students but also as people. What incoming freshmen should be told is that the people we meet in this hub of cultural and spiritual diversity are the people who give our character dimension. For Outten, the connections that he made at USC have defined his entire life, both on set and off.
How else do we come to understand ourselves? And what is college anyway, but one long conversation?

The Downtown art gallery Crewest opened its doors Saturday to an eager crowd awaiting the newest exhibition: “Faces of Skid Row.”
Street art · Crewest art gallery’s latest exhibit features works from various artists with ties to the homeless communities in Los Angeles, including the work of featured artist Mason Brown, whose cardboard statue, named “Clocky,” blends clock symbolism with fortune-telling. - James Violette | Daily Trojan
Curated by Luna George, the exhibit is an effort to raise awareness about homelessness in Los Angeles. George focused her attention on Skid Row and gathered artists based on their relationship with the streets.
The gallery features Los Angeles-based artists that work through a variety of media, including graffiti, photography, watercolor, cardboard and canvas.
“This is just an exhibition to bring awareness to the fact that [homeless] people are living out there, and when [visitors] leave this gallery, they are going to see the reality and they are going to totally understand what we are talking about,” George said.
Crewest joined efforts with The Midnight Mission, a nonprofit organization committed to bettering the lives of the homeless, to promote Faces of Skid Row as both an art exhibit and fundraiser. Running through Oct. 31, the exhibit will coincide with another Midnight Mission fundraiser on Oct. 23.
The Midnight Mission is a service organization located on Skid Row for more than a century and continues to provide education, counseling and job placement to Skid Row residents. All contributions made at the door were donated to The Midnight Mission; and several artists  pledged the profits from the sale of their pieces.
Located just north of campus, Crewest sits on Winston Street, between South Main and South Los Angeles streets. Since its arrival on the art scene in May 2002, Crewest has celebrated street art and the culture that surrounds it.
“The talent that we have coming in here is so urban, and we’re very much into promoting graffiti art and street art only because the other venues don’t really cater to that type of art,” George said. “We are constantly committed to promoting our talent, whoever it is.”
“Faces of Skid Row” features an installation by artist Mason Brown, an accomplished filmmaker and graphic artist. Brown’s installation introduces gallery-goers to his cardboard creation “Do you know what time it is? Clocky does…” According to a statement issued by Crewest, Clocky is “a fortune telling machine cloaked under the guise of a temporal devise.” George said that Brown is an artist and a humanitarian who found a way to blend both in his arresting art pieces.
Other parts of the exhibit at Crewest include the work of well-known Los Angeles street photographer Eriberto Oriol. Among the photos displayed were Skid Row residents that many visitors immediately recognized. Shown next to Oriol’s photography was the work of his son, Estevan Oriol. Both father and son have been immersed in Los Angeles street culture for some time, and their work was a focal point of the exhibition.
Also showing at “Faces of Skid Row” is a formerly unknown artist who works under the moniker Lito. George approached several nonprofit organizations in the Skid Row area in hopes of discovering artists that she could feature at the exhibition. Because of a lack of funding, George learned that many of the nonprofits did not have art programs for the homeless.
“The only [artist] I was able to find yet is this guy Lito, and he’s actually only been drawing for six months and he lives in the Skid Row area,” George said. “He has just a little box with a pencil and eraser, and for him it’s making him happy.”
In this tumultuous financial climate, galleries are apprehensive to take chances on showing new artists; Crewest is devoted to giving street art the respect it deserves no matter who is behind the art.
“We believe in seeking talent,” George said. “Talent can be everywhere and anywhere and all talent deserves the right to show their art.”

On Sept. 20, the USC Viterbi School of Engineering launched a new smartphone application, Visibility, which monitors air pollution. The application is an air visibility sensing system that allows the public to take a picture of the sky and observe the air quality.
Quality control· The Visibility application allows users to take a photo of the sky, and compare it to an ideal sky to determine the air quality. - Photo courtesy of the Viterbi School of Engineering
The idea of the application was the brainchild of Gaurav Sukhatme, a computer science professor in Viterbi. It was created under the Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory at USC by Anoop Nimkar and Anupam Tulsyan, both graduate students studying computer science.
“Being L.A., air quality is something we always worry about,” said Sameera Poduri, a postdoctoral research associate at Viterbi who worked on the application. “A recent report by RAND  has estimated that California paid about $200 million in air quality health costs over two years. To improve air quality, we have to be able to monitor it.”
She said Sukhatme and the students worked together to create the application.
“Gaurav suggested the air quality monitoring problem to me two years ago. I tried a few different ideas and decided on the current approach of comparing sky luminance models with images taken from mobile phones,” Poduri said.
The application compares images of the real sky to ideal images of what the sky should look like, Poduri said.
People who have seen the application are excited about the possibilities, said Eric Mankin, the media relations representative for Viterbi, and believe it will introduce a new system of obtaining results on public health information.
The system makes use of crowdsourcing — results from a large group of people that can drive a certain idea — and will allow researchers to receive continuously updated data on air quality from observers, since there are a sparse amount of current monitoring stations.
Visibility is a free application that can be used by anyone across the globe. Currently, it is only available for download on Android phone, though it will soon be available on the iPhone. Users aim the smartphone upward to take a picture of the sky, which is automatically sent to a central computer at USC for analysis.
Since the application is brand-new, there is still room for improvements, Poduri said. It’s not simply a point-and-click process; it might ask the user for a clearer image or position of the sky. Once the picture takes a clean image, it sends the time and location back to the servers at USC.
“Our current Visibility app is only a prototype,” Poduri said. “We want to make the app itself appealing and easy to use. A lot of these changes will be based on the data and feedback we are getting from users.”
Some students on campus said they felt that the Visibility application is a great idea. Some students expressed how the application will be beneficial for certain weekly activities.
“I definitely think the app is a great way to conduct research on the environment. Being from Santa Monica, where there is smog, would help me to determine whether it’s a good day to run or not,” said Evelina Weary, a sophomore majoring in public relations.
Although some students support the main idea of the application, they said it wouldn’t make a difference in their day-to-day activities.
“It sounds like a great tool for checking the pollution, but even if I test the quality, I still have to live with the results and go about my day,” said Morgan Tucker, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting.
The Visibility application is making progress, with more than 250 downloads so far. It can be downloaded online at the USC Robotics website or from an Android phone.

USC jumped 39 spots in Times Higher Education’s World University Rankings 2010 in one year, moving from 112 to 73 in the rankings of universities across the globe.
The university received an overall score of 60.7 percent, which indicates that when compared to another randomly selected university, USC is ranked higher 63 percent of the time. USC tied with the University of Adelaide in Australia for the 73rd spot.
Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said that although parents and students tend to consider the rankings when looking for a college, he said he believes the rankings don’t incorporate the actual undergraduate experience.
“Rating a university like a consumer product, such as a toaster or automobile, is an iffy proposition … you have to be an informed consumer,” Brunold said.
THE ranked Harvard University as the best university in the world. Out of the top 200 universities, 72 were American universities. In North America, USC ranked 48th.
U.S. News & World Report, which annually releases its National Universities Rankings, ranked USC 23rd in the nation.
THE developed and implemented a new methodology for ranking universities this year. It used 13 indicators separated into five separate categories to rank each university.
“We are not 100 percent certain that these are the top 200 universities. This is not a deceleration, but an academic process. We encourage criticism,” said Richard Reynolds, a researcher at THE.
Each university received a percent score in every category, which was weighted based on its overall importance.
USC performed best in the citation category, receiving a score of 71.9 percent. The citation category is defined as the number of times that a university’s research appears in a sampling of 12,000 research journals over a five-year period.
Citation is 32.5 percent of the composite score. USC received its second highest score in the citation category last year.
USC achieved its lowest score in international mix of 31.2 percent. THE defines international mix as the ratio of international academic staff to total academic staff and the ratio of international students to total students.
Brunold said, however, that the university has a higher percentage of international students.
“For eight years running, USC has had more international students than any other university in the United States,” Brunold said.
USC’s second lowest score was a 48.7 percent in research. The university’s research was evaluated for its volume, research income and reputation, and represented 30 percent of the overall score.
Yet, the university scored well in teaching, which is determined mostly though a reputational survey completed by professionals from various regions and across various disciplines.
“The rankings are something we can look positively toward. Hopefully USC can build on that,” said Rodrigo Aguiar, an undeclared sophomore.
Ashima Sharma, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, said she thought rankings were initially important when applying to college.
“Rankings are helpful when applying to college, but once you’re in college, it’s the experience that matters,” she said.

In the last month, faculty involved with USC’s health economics program received three separate healthcare reform research grants from the federal government totaling about $20 million.
The funding came from a $1.1 billion commitment by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to research comparative effectiveness, which, according to USC Vice President of Research Randolph Hall, is the study of understanding which treatments and therapies for patients are most productive and cost-effective.
“There is quite a bit of variability in how healthcare is practiced around the country, even within an individual clinic,” Hall said. “[This research] is a way of creating a more scientific and systematic way of delivering care so that the patient gets better results.”
Though all three research initiatives fall into the category of comparative effectiveness, each project is different, focusing on a separate facet of the improvement of healthcare in the United States.
“[These grants are] unprecedented for this area of research,” Hall said. “And now we’re really moving up to be one of the top programs in the entire country.”
The $11.4 million grant from the National Institutes of Health — the largest ever received by the pharmacy school — will go to Jason Doctor, an associate professor of psychology and behavioral economics at the School of Pharmacy, to study ways to eliminate unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions.
The second grant awarded $5.5 million to Dana Goldman, director of the Leonard D. Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics at USC.
Goldman’s grant is also funded by NIH, as part of a holistic program addressing the top priorities of NIH Director Francis Collins. Goldman and his team will research ways to reform Medicare.
And lastly, $3 million from the Department of Health and Human Services was given to Shinyi Wu, an assistant professor in the Epstein Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering.
Wu, alongside co-principal investigator Kathleen Ell from the USC School of Social Work, will work on enhancing the treatment for people who are both depressed and diabetic.
All three research projects together will involve at least a dozen faculty and possibly 20 or more staff overall. This is large compared to a typical grant, which usually includes one faculty member and one student, according to Steven Moldin, executive director of the USC Washington, D.C. Office of Research Advancement.
The effect of the grants and the subsequent research will help expand the health economics program, he said, which is a fairly new department at USC.
“This research [allows us to build] our program here in health economics and health policy to further establish USC as a leader in those fields,” Moldin said. “[It will enhance] the schools reputation and also provide all these wonderful opportunities for a lot of clinical research.”

The Supreme Court turned down an appeal Monday by the University of South Carolina to register an interlocking “SC” logo as its trademark.
The University of South Carolina contested a ruling made in January, which said  the university could not use the “SC” logo for sports and apparel merchandise. The Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.
Michelle Hanabusa | Daily Trojan
Federal trademark law does not allow registrations that are likely to cause confusion. The University of South Carolina argued that its logo was distinct enough to be registered.
According to the University of South Carolina, its logo would use curved letters, instead of the blocked “SC” that the University of Southern California uses.
The University of South Carolina first attempted to trademark an “SC” logo in 1997, but the University of Southern California contested it.
A special Trademark Trial and Appeal Board was formed and concluded that, though “real fans” would know the difference between the two logos, it would be confusing to casual fans.
The Supreme Court decision yesterday to throw out the case means that the University of South Carolina cannot try the case again.
Lawyers for the University of Southern California argued that “SC” had been used as a University of Southern California logo for decades, while the University of South Carolina had used “Carolina” or “USC” instead.

Open textbooks are the best answer to the plight of cash-strapped college students, according to a study released last week by the national Student Public Interest Research Groups.
Openly licensed textbooks — books that are available in print or digital formats — are affordable alternatives to the current printed and bound format, said the report, titled A Cover to Cover Solution.
The survey of more than 1,400 students found that open textbooks accommodate students’ preferences toward the readability and functionality of the printed format and the convenience of the digital one.
Digital textbooks also appeal to the financial concerns of students — and their parents — by reducing average textbook costs by 80 percent.
David Mittelstein, the USC co-chair of the California Public Interest Research Group, said the report is a reaction to the increasingly high costs of textbooks.
“The reason we made the study in the first place is the cost of textbooks is out of control,” he said. “The average student is spending about $900 per year and prices have risen more than four times during inflation in the last two decades.”
Pertusati Bookstore Manager Raymond McDermott said he believes that open textbooks will not prove to be a viable solution because students might still prefer print books. He doesn’t see teachers using open textbooks in the near future.
“I think [open textbooks] will fit a niche,” McDermott said. “But I don’t think they will change the entire textbook industry. They might replace textbooks in [general education] classes, but I don’t really see them in high-level graduate classes.”
The study was released after federal regulations from the Higher Education Opportunity Act — passed in 2008 by former President George W. Bush — were put into effect on July 1. These new regulations oblige schools to provide a full list of the assigned textbooks to students during class registration.
The act affects publishers by requiring them to disclose the prices and revision information of the books they market to instructors. Another provision prevents publishers from bundling textbooks with various CDs, booklets and other optional media often not required or utilized by the professor.
Letticia Lee, a freshman majoring in environmental studies, said she spent $550 for her textbooks at the bookstore this semester, but she was able to purchase one of her books on the Internet.
“It wasn’t available at the bookstore, so I bought it online,” she said, “It was much cheaper.”
Lee and her parents said they weren’t informed about the new regulations or about other available alternatives, such as renting textbooks or buying them used online. They are skeptical, however, about the concept of open textbooks.
“We’re going to wait and see how technology develops,” said her father, Ray Lee.
The Student PIRGs found that most students shared the views of Lee and her parents. The print format was preferred by 75 percent of students surveyed.
Shamoiya Washington, a freshman majoring in political science, said she rented all of her textbooks this semester from textbook rental site Chegg.com.
“I prefer to have the book in front of me,” she said. “But it depends on the price. If there’s a big difference, I’d go for it.”
Nicole Allen, the textbooks advocate for Student PIRGs and the campaign director for Make Textbooks Affordable, believes that the reason open textbooks will succeed in the market is because of students like Washington who want affordable, printed material.
“Students generally do prefer printed books,” she said, “But I think that’s the great thing about open textbooks. They will provide students with the option of print or digital formats. It’s easy to dismiss open textbooks, and it’s going to take innovation to make it work.”
McDermott cites the high cost of manufacturing a textbook — the costs it takes to pay artists, writers, researchers and other contributors — as another reason open textbooks will not successfully replace printed and bound books.
Publishers of open textbooks, he said, are only surviving with the help of a large venture capital.
“No one has shown that open source is a financially sustainable solution,” McDermott said.
Allen, however, said more and more money is being invested in the format.
“At the bottom of the economic downturn, people are investing millions of dollars into this company,” she said. “They wouldn’t do that if they didn’t think it was a viable solution.”
Allen said she advises students to get the word out and contact their elected officials to bring the need for open textbooks to their attention.
“Change isn’t going to happen overnight,” Allen said.

Healthcare needs to be student priority
Though it is not difficult to find political opinions about healthcare policy around campus, few students know what the new healthcare law will mean for them.  Since many students are young and healthy, we tend to not spend too much time worrying about our insurance coverage, which can make healthcare seem very political and abstract.
Unfortunately, medical emergencies can affect young adults just as they do everyone else.  Having a policy that insures affordable and quality healthcare can prevent your $10,000 visit to an emergency department from leaving you heavily in debt.
Two weeks ago the Daily Trojan ran the inspiring story of Joshua Lilientstein, a Keck School of Medicine student who fought against testicular cancer.  Though his cancer is thankfully in remission, his costs exceeded what the university health policy was willing to pay, and there was a brief time that he was fully responsible for his cancer treatments.  Had Joshua had the opportunity to remain under his parent’s employer-based policy, he might not be suffering from mounting debt and a low credit score today.
As university students, it is critical that we educate ourselves about our new rights and responsibilities under the new healthcare law.  Josh’s struggle with insurance companies should encourage each of us to be proactive in finding affordable, quality healthcare coverage.
Thankfully, the new health reform law has many provisions in place specifically tailored to offer students higher quality, more affordable health care coverage.  On Sept. 23, policies in the Affordable Health Care Act came into effect that give young adults many new consumer protections and benefits, including most prominently:
— Young adults can stay on their parents’ plan until age 26.
— Insurers cannot drop policies when you get sick because of paperwork errors.
These simple policies are a huge victory in the efforts to secure healthcare coverage for young adults.  An estimated 196,000 Californian young adults could benefit from the provision that allows them to stay on their family coverage plan until age 26, according to the consumer group California Public Interest Research Group.
Finding health insurance coverage for the first time can be somewhat intimidating.  However, there are many resources for students to learn more about the new protections in the healthcare law.  To help young people and all consumers inform themselves about what the new law will mean for them, CalPIRG has produced The Young Person’s Guide to Health Insurance.
The guide offers clear, factual information about how young people can make the most of the new healthcare provisions and instructions on applying to join or rejoin your parents’ family insurance plan; comparing private insurance options online at www.healthcare.gov; and of course, finding a job with great health insurance benefits
CalPIRG volunteers will be distributing this guide to students, health centers and doctors’ offices across our area.  It is also available online at http://www.studentpirgs.org/healthcareguide.
As Joshua’s story demonstrates, students can’t take health for granted.  By arming ourselves with information about our new rights, we can make sure we stay healthy — and debt-free — to graduation and beyond.

Students need to know how to navigate the healhcare system as it is now, but it would be even better if those that are 20-30 could pool their technical genius and truly FIX the system. There is so much nonsense and waste in healthcare, it needs a major overhaul. I have worked in healthcare over 30 years and it is such a mess, it is going to take someone (or some group) to really expose the garbage and revise the system and make it easier to navigate and manage. It is truly a mess and a shame that it has evolved/deteriorated to the system we have. I am not talking about the providers, most of them are providing good care, it is the rest of the stuff they have to deal with that does NOT contribute to quality of care. If good providers were able to do their job instead of all the paperwork nonsense and insurance games, we would all be much better off. The problem is most people don’t know how bad it really is and the prediction is it is going to get worse, let me tell you, if something doesn’t change, it will be a whole lot worse and not just because of health care reform but because the nonsense just gets in the way. In the age of technology and all the talented youth we have in this country and all the unemployed business people, this job should be tackled and solved.
“Had Joshua had the opportunity to remain under his parent’s employer-based policy, he might not be suffering from mounting debt and a low credit score today.”
Wouldn’t the issue be the university’s health policy? And why it wouldn’t cover his cancer treatments?

Bullying seems like a simple term — one that we all recognize.
Still, it has taken six teens taking their own lives in the last month alone before it yet again became evident to the American media that there’s been a spike in the hateful pandemic spreading through today’s youth.
The most recent of these tragedies took place in New Jersey when Tyler Clementi, a freshman at Rutgers University, jumped off the George Washington Bridge on Sept. 22, three days after Clementi’s roommate allegedly streamed live webcam footage of Clementi’s intimate encounters with another male student.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Cruelty is not a new discovery. The more horrific aspects of the incident lie in the methods of communication involved.
Clementi’s farewell statement was simply a chilling Facebook status update that read, “Jumping off the gw bridge sorry,” according to The New York Times.
Clementi’s roommate abused technology to violate privacy; many of our peers do as well.
This casual attitude toward web media and proliferation is disturbingly pervasive. For Clementi’s roommate, it resulted in charges of privacy invasion.
But how many more tragedies like Clementi’s can occur before we stop standing by silently?
The complication with virtual bullying is that it provides a mask of unique anonymity that allows people to be more abusive than they would ever dare be to a person’s face.
Moreover, the instantaneous nature of Internet slander has eliminated those key moments that involve thinking before you act.
As shown in The Social Network, even the origins of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg’s Facemash.com, are allegedly ones of cowardly teasing.
Despite the reckless hatred that so often surrounds us in the Millennial set, we do have a few things to be grateful for.
We are making strides toward acknowledging this bullying on a legislative level, with acts like the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act, enacted in October 2009.
Additionally, in January 2009 the California state legislature enacted one of the first laws in the country dealing directly with cyberbullying.
Demonstrating that the same viral nature of our generation’s technology that contributed to Clementi’s death can still be put to constructive use, public figures, such as Ellen DeGeneres, have used video posts to promote tolerance.
But for every Ellen, there’s a 50 Cent, who tweeted despicable remarks about oral sex and suicide following this month’s tragedies.
Openly gay journalist Dan Savage recently started the It Gets Better Project, a video series that encourages lesbian, gay, bisexual and transsexual adults to submit videos about how they were able to recover after childhood bullying.
But unfortunately, it’s become increasingly evident that cyberbullying doesn’t always stop after graduation day.
Michigan Assistant Attorney General Andrew Shirvell, for instance, ran a blog vilifying the University of Michigan’s first openly homosexual student body president, Chris Armstrong. He called him “Satan’s representative” and a “Nazi-like recruiter for the cult that is homosexuality,” going so far as to stalk and harass Armstrong, his family and friends on Facebook.
All this from a public official.
The bottom line is this: With technological power comes social responsibility, and our generation has been given more of the former than any other before us.
Thresholds need to be more tangibly determined and limits more clearly drawn. Of course, these are things that develop over time, but how much time are we willing to waste when more and more tragedies like Clementi’s are appearing on college campuses?

I suppose I agree that this should not be a “gay issue,’ only because it is a human issue.  And I suppose, from an originality standpoint, I applaud the author’s unique technology-focused angle on this topic.  However the article totally neglects that this horrific trend of suicides in the gay community is entirely a product of homophobia.  I beg to differ with the commenter who believes the same outcome would have been likely with a young girl in a heterosexual sex tape.  There are far too many incidents like this in the GLBT community for us to read these ones as outliers, or as something that also happens frequently in the heterosexual community.  Yes, technology is a marker of our generation, and something we must take responsibility for.  But how about taking responsibility for ending the societal acceptance of homophobia?  Articles written about this topic, in my opinion, cannot skirt around the main issue at hand: hate.  Not the internet.
As a third generation Trojan alumnus, I applaud the maturity and clarity of Allegra Tepper’s editorial and much of the subsequent commentary. Experience has taught me that “Trojan Family” is not a pair of words; it is a way of life for all of us irrespective of our backgrounds or our inclinations in any or all directions. To that end, I would encourage the entire student body (since “Administration” seems to be silent on the topic) to continue the Trojan traditions of tolerance and fairness.
I agree we should not make this a “gay” issue. I am even wondering  if it makes sense to talk about it too much as a bullying issues as well. what happened here was a gross violation of a universal right to privacy. Everyone close your eyes and imagine the last time you had sex someone was watching you on their computer. Now imagine that person also allowed you to be broadcast publicly over the internet. All this under the rubric of a “prank.” 
Everyone should be outraged – gay, straight, student, parent, citizen. A dorm is the main domicile for thousands of students everywhere. If we are saying we can not expect to have privacy when we are at our very most vulnerable and expecting of privacy then society has fallen apart at the seams. Whatever punishment you think these idiots deserve just imagine that last time you had sex, you were broadcast live for all to see what you do behind closed doors.
‘Clementi’s farewell statement was simply a chilling Facebook status update that read, “Jumping off the gw bridge sorry,” according to The New York Times.’
That is absolutely heartbreaking. As for 50 Cent… his opinion is not even worth 2 cents.
That being said – please do not confuse political views, like support of Prop 8, with “hate.” The two are different. 
What’s more, I don’t think we should make Tyler’s tragedy a “gay” issue, in that I can see a young lady also taking drastic and tragic steps had she been videotaped performing sex acts with a guy. I think the issue here is the incredibly nasty behavior of those who used their cameras to invade someone’s intimate moments. It is pretty sickening. My heart goes out to Tyler’s parents.
Accidentally causing physical harm to someone can lead to an assault charge. Intentionally assaulting someone emotionally on this scale should offer at least some of the same consequences. I don’t see the difference. In fact, I would rather be physically hurt than this.
Hmm,
You make some solid and clear points. Keep up the good work  : )

Recent reports have revealed that the University of California schools are making a more conscientious and successful effort at recruiting students from all backgrounds and income levels.
In the wake of the recession, the UC system has been increasingly criticized for lacking a true representation of all of California’s socioeconomic classes. More specifically, it’s been scrutinized for its increasing inability to provide adequate education to students in lower income brackets.
Fortunately, that’s a scrutiny the system can withstand. Recent changes effected in the UC financial aid system are allowing a broader range of students to enroll than ever before. The UC schools should be lauded for their efforts, especially given the current economy.
A Los Angeles Times article reported Oct. 2 that undergraduate fees for in-state students are $2,500 higher than last year.
These price tags are hefty regardless of a family’s net income. But particularly for students who come from more modest backgrounds, the large sums can be discouraging, and often a deterrent from even applying to one of the UC schools.
So when statistics were published that the UC schools were in fact doing a better job of providing financial aid to their prospective attendees, the dissenters were silent.
The Associated Press reported on Oct. 1 that “an estimated 39 percent of all UC undergraduates enrolled for fall 2010 receive Federal Pell Grants, which are generally awarded to students with family incomes below $50,000.”
This is a substantial improvement from the 31 percent reported two years earlier. It is also the most amount of aid that the UCs have offered in their history.
Furthermore, UC President Mark Yudof hopes to raise the income ceiling of the Blue + Gold Opportunity Plan — a financial aid program providing coverage of all fees for students coming from families earning less than $70,000 — which would ultimately extend this package to those who earn more but still find themselves unable to finance a college degree.
Washington Monthly Magazine recently released a statement ranking UC San Diego first, UC Berkeley second and UCLA third for top universities.
This was particularly notable given the parameters of assessment, which unlike most other college rankings focused solely on the public good. Schools were evaluated based on their success in providing “social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something back to their country).”
Although the overwhelming public sentiment surrounding these changes has been one of emphatic praise and optimism for the future, there has still been a significant amount of criticism.
In response to a Los Angeles Times article, one angry comment captured the sentiments of the border-conscious, worrying that these new policies are effectively turning UC schools into “welfare universities,” illegal residents will  benefit unfairly.
These benefits are seen by some as threatening the quality of education that would ultimately be provided to native-born, legal residents.
Because the adjustments have been made so recently, however, there has been no conclusive research indicating whether that is in fact the case; it is more likely an exaggerated complaint from someone on the far right.
On the other hand, some argue that increasing the accessibility of college to lower-income households might jeopardize the prospects of middle- and upper-class students hoping to get into their UC school of choice, because the applicant pool will likely increase in response to these reforms.
Though these are undoubtedly necessary and fair improvements to the financial aid system, the perceived threat to more affluent individuals is starting to be felt. The Los Angeles Times reported the overall percentage of students from $99,000-plus per year families has dropped three percent from 29 to 26 percent.
Ultimately, this is still promising news. Education should be accessible to all who aspire and work hard enough toward it.
As California public schools continue to flounder, this increase in UC financial aid is emphatically welcomed, especially as it now makes college a realistic and plausible possibility where it once was not.
Prior to the recession, the UC system was seen as a prime example of exemplary public college education. Indeed, as a non-Californian, I lusted after these schools myself.
California is often looked to as a frontier for education, and these changes in the financial aid system are a much-needed step in the right direction.

Students at California community colleges are facing significant problems as they try to register for classes for the upcoming school year, according to the Los Angeles Times.
This comes as a result of recent budget cuts, as well as rising enrollment numbers caused by the largest high school graduating class in the history of the state of California.
Many students are being placed on the wait list for some or all of their classes, and are consequently having to wait longer to obtain a degree or look for a job.
One temporary solution that some students are utilizing is taking classes at different community colleges in the Los Angeles area, in order to reach the 12 units need for full-time student status.
Last year, the community college system cut 8 percent of its overall budget, equal to approximately $520 million. As a result, many schools are lowering class sizes or cutting classes all together, leaving students who are looking to complete their degree requirements with little options.
“I want to be successful, but I don’t know if I’m going to be able to reach my goals,” Kiyan Noyes-Aponte, a mechanical engineering major at Orange Coast College, told the Los Angeles Times. “I was scared and stressed. I was literally desperate for classes.”

If you thought you saw grown men dressed as Spider-man or Mr. Incredible down at L.A. Live on Saturday, don’t worry — the Hollywood Walk of Fame hasn’t moved Downtown.
But whereas you might see a dozen or so impersonators in Hollywood, L.A. Live welcomed 1,580 — yes, 1,580 — masked crusaders on Saturday as part of a promotional event for the upcoming DreamWorks film Megamind, which opens next month.
And if that sounds like a lot of superheroes, it was. The Guinness Book of World Records said the event was now considered the “largest number of costumed crusaders gathered in one place, at one time,” beating out the old record by 79 people, according to LAist.
Will Ferrell, who stars in the film, was presented with a certificate at the event, where he suggested that participants aim for another record by keeping their costumes on for the rest of the month.
Blogdowntown has pictures of the now-official “largest superhero gathering” here.

The No. 2 Women’s golf team heads to the north this week to look for its first victory of the season at the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational. The team was knocked from its preseason No. 1 perch after two straight third-place finishes in its first two tournaments and is looking to regain that ranking this week at the Tacoma Country and Golf Club in Tacoma, Wash.
Leading the way for the Women of Troy is the team’s lone senior, Lizette Salas. The three-time All-American had a 21st-place finish last week at the Mason Rudolph Championship and a third-place finish at the season opening Fall Preview. Salas, as one of the most successful players in USC history and the only remaining player from the 2008 championship team, is the de facto leader of the team, but looks to the younger girls to provide help.
Junior transfer Lisa McCloskey has certainly led by example since joining the Women of Troy this season. Her first two tournaments in cardinal and gold ended with fourth-place finishes at the Fall Preview and Mason Rudolph. McCloskey, a two time All-American at Pepperdine, was named to Golf World’s “Top Ten Women’s Golf Collegiate Players to Watch” this season, as was Salas.
Also stepping into a leadership role this season is junior Inah Park. A key member of the national runner-up squad from last season, Park placed 23rd in her season debut last week at the Mason Rudolph after sitting out the Fall Preview.
Also playing for the team this week is sophomore Cyna Rodriguez, who has two top-30 finishes to begin the season, highlighted by a 26th place finish at the Mason Rudolph. Rodriguez is the third and final returner from last season’s team and is looking to improve upon her debut season.
Rounding out the roster this week is freshman Sophia Popov. Popov, a German native, joined the Women of Troy after a successful summer highlighted by a victory at the 2010 International European Ladies Amateur Championship. She tied for 67th in her USC debut at the Fall Preview and looks to improve upon that this week.
The Women of Troy are certainly looking in the right place if they hope to find that first victory of the season. USC has won this event seven times, with the most recent coming in 2007. It’s also had six players capture individual titles at the tournament. The field at the invitational, though strong, is much weaker than their first two tournaments, with only four opponents ranked in the top 25. The tournament runs through Wednesday.

As USC fans prepare to travel to San Francisco for the annual Weekender, another group is heading up to the Bay Area later this week — Pac-10 athletic directors.
The athletic directors will convene in San Francisco on Oct. 7-8, and plan to discuss issues pertinent to the conference, such as splitting the expanded Pac-12 into divisions and the location of the long-overdue conference title game. They are also expected to discuss revenue sharing.
Still, pundits and Pac-10 officials are both skeptical about any real decisions being made at the meeting.
“I don’t expect any announcements or news coming out of the AD meeting,” Pac-10 Commissioner Larry Scott said.
Many plans have been proposed to remedy the Pac-10 division puzzle. One popular idea is that of a North-South split, which would put four California schools and the two Arizona schools in the South, and the Northwest schools, along with conference newcomers Utah and Colorado, in the North. This plan, however, is particularly unattractive to the northern cold-weather schools, who would be stuck playing in harsher conditions than those in the South.
Next, the ever-popular zipper variation is continually shot down, as nobody can seem to create a plan that leaves long-standing rivalries intact. A zipper variation would most likely split up these geography-based rivalries.
Finally, a radical new “pod” plan has been proposed that includes three pods made up of four teams (one California pod, one Northwest pod and one Arizona/Mountain pod) that would have the entire conference split up into two divisions, and schools playing schedules against every team in their pod as well two teams from each other pod. This system has the advantage of preserving rivalries while crossing geographical boundaries and varying schedule year to year — but with the disadvantage of confusing everyone involved. However, because of the dual categories of division and pod, this idea violates NCAA regulations, which dictate that teams must play every other team in their division.
Eventually one plan will emerge the winner — but don’t expect it soon.

The California Supreme Court ruled Monday that the 200,000 mandated furloughs for state employees last year were legal, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered the employees to take unpaid days because of the state’s fiscal crisis. The employees, however, sued with the argument that only the legislature could cut pay.
Though the court agreed that a governor does not have the sole authority to mandate furloughs, because legislators approved a budget measure that reflected Schwarzenegger’s order, the court ruled that the furloughs were valid.
“These decisions were absolutely necessary to keep our state functioning. Today’s ruling upholds the state’s actions to protect taxpayers and ensure we live within our means, just like every California family and business must do,” Schwarzenegger told the Times.
More than 30 lawsuits were filed against the governor.

Tired of seeing your friends updating their Facebook statuses to something about The Social Network?
From the looks of it, don’t expect those updates to go away any time soon. The David Fincher-directed film, which depicts the creation of the popular social networking site and the troubles that arose for co-founder Mark Zuckerberg (played by Jesse Eisenberg), topped the box office this weekend. Receiving $23 million on its opening weekend, the film generated more revenue than two of its weekend competitors Let Me In and Case 39, combined.
Though numbers in attendance were high for this dark comedy, audience reviews averaging a B+ were not up the roof as movie critics such as Roger Ebert’s analyses were. Ebert praised the film for having the “rare quality of being not only as smart as its brilliant hero, but in the same way. It is cocksure, impatient, cold, exciting and instinctively perceptive.”
But as Ben Fritz of the Los Angeles Times notes, the question now is not to focus on The Social Network’s opening weekend revenue, but to see if it maintain its initial success and expand its audience in the weeks to come.

With the ITA/D’Novo All-American Championship players scheduled to play in Tulsa throughout the upcoming week, three younger Trojans helped build up their individual rèsumès in San Francisco.
Second-seeded freshman Raymond Sarmiento had quite a day Sunday, as he came from behind to win the singles final 3-6, 6-2, 6-1. He also won the doubles final paired with sophomore JT Sundling 8-2.
In addition to the finals appearance in doubles, Sundling gave a strong performance in the singles draw.
He beat USF’s Ola Bakke and Ben McLachlan in two straight sets. No. 1 seed Thai Tu, who Sarmiento defeated in the finals, took out Sundling 2-6, 6-3, 6-3 in the semifinal round.
Still, coach Peter Smith sees a lot of positives from the sophomore’s performance.
“We have been playing great tennis,” Smith said. “JT played a good match with the No. 1 seed. He has been a much improved player from last year.”
Freshman Michael Grant also competed over at the Battle in the Bay, and all three Trojans had at least one win during the weekend in the unique setting for tennis.
“It’s a really amazingly cool club right in the heart of San Francisco,” Smith said. “So far it has been a fun experience to be at.”
Grant won his opening match against USF’s Richard Bucalem 7-5, 6-2, but fell short to Riki McLachlan the next round.
In his first appearance for the Trojans, Grant has demonstrated that he has the tools to contribute to the championship-level tennis expected of the USC team.
“Grant has shown flashes of being a great player,” Smith said. “There is something to build on.”
In Sarmiento’s run to the singles title, he only dropped one set in four matches.
Sarmiento’s biggest contribution could come on the doubles court, and Smith feels that his skills translate well even though he still needs to develop.
“Ray has a lot of great doubles skills,” Smith said. “He needs more consistency in his game. He is a human highlight reel, but for every two highlights there is one lowlight.”
With more focus on fundamentals, Smith feels that Sarmiento will harness his athleticism and become an excellent doubles player.
“We would like him to become more boring on the court,” Smith said. “He is a talented athlete and a good player. With better foot work and shot selection he could have a very bright future.”
