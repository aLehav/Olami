The NBA basketball season tipped off earlier this week, and with its return comes a number of supplementary aspects that have become staples of the culture, like NBA Twitter and ‘Inside the NBA’. 
One of those “staples,” though, is treading a dangerous line between insight and excessiveness. 
The supplement I reference is the use of analytics in basketball conversations and, on a greater scale, player-personnel decision making. Defined as information resulting from the systematic analysis of data and statistics, analytics play a major role in basketball and anywhere else where statistics are relevant (more on that second part later).
With that said, analytics in basketball are spiraling out of control. 
Look no further than a recent debate on the efficiency of mid-range jumpers between NBA writer Matt Moore and NBA superstar Kevin Durant. After about thirty minutes of back and forth, Moore referred Durant to a simple, but also understandably confusing, axis data set. Durant spoke for the majority of the basketball community with his response:
“Who … wants to look at graphs while having a hoop convo?”
I omitted two words between “who” and “wants” from Durant’s actual response, but you can use your imagination. The first was “the,” just in case you’re struggling. 
The interaction between the two prominent basketball figures illustrated a developing problem in the sport — analytics have become too advanced for basketball’s own good. For example, the Basketball Index, a website respected for providing unique data models, posted an analysis of how Utah Jazz small forward Bojan Bogdanovic ranked above the 93rd percentile in total three-point gravity last season. 
First off, what is a total three-point gravity rating? Revisit that sentence, and add the same two words omitted from Durant’s earlier quote in between “what” and “is”. 
While I’m sure the rating has some legitimacy, the harmful nature of the post was the fact that just one line after supposedly praising Bogdanovic as one of the league’s best shooters, the post claims that the odds of the Utah forward generating a positive return on investment is 0.04%. 
Posts like that should spark a combination of anger and fear in  fans of the sport for two reasons. 
This trend of over analyzing to the point of bad decision-making seems primed to become commonplace in basketball, as it allows executives to operate in a safe numerical comfort zone rather than potentially risking their job by signing a player based off observation. 
On the surface, the adopted practice maximizes efficiency and minimizes risk, but in reality, using numbers as the sole factor in making decisions leads to head-scratching moves and a lack of innovation. Just ask the music industry and its obsession with streaming numbers. 
Rolling Stone reported that major record companies — Sony, Universal and Warner — are signing nearly two new artists per day in 2019 just to keep up with the demand of long-tail income from streaming services. Long-tail income is defined by Investopedia as a period when sales for less common products can return a profit due to reduced marketing and distribution costs.
In other words, it’s the demand for more songs with less support for said songs. 
Music companies signing two new artists per day seems fine initially, as it is logically assumed that more artists equals more opportunity. However, with so many new artists coming in like clockwork, new talents are actually receiving less of an opportunity than they would have had they remained independent or stuck with a small label. 
Major artist manager Ian Montone summarized the problem best: “I’ve been in label meetings when they’ve literally said, ‘Sorry, the song’s not working.’ The song’s been out literally a day — what are you talking about? ‘Nope, we’ve read the numbers — we’re going to move on.’”
Analytics have become so ingrained in the music industry that even top executives have begun to recognize that quantitatively measuring artists is reaching sad extremes.
Jody Gerson, the CEO and chair of Universal Music Publishing Group and the person responsible for signing artists such as Billie Eilish, Lady Gaga, Khalid and Post Malone, has actually spoken out against music labels spreading their bets across a number of artists rather than investing long-term in an artist’s development.
“One big difference today is that the industry has bought into this idea that we have to keep on feeding distribution and the [streaming] platforms,” Gerson said in an interview with Music Business USA Magazine. “But there is only so much music that can be brilliant.”
As someone whose career is directly linked to data points such as number of clicks, bounce rate and unique visitors, I understand the power of analytics. When used correctly as a means of finding trends to see what works and what falls flat, analytics can be game-changing. However, when advanced analytics aren’t backed by advanced observation, bad decisions are made — like giving up on an artist after one song flopped or thinking one of the best shooters in the league is somehow worth less than his peers.

The USC women’s volleyball team hosts No. 15 Cal and No. 2 Stanford — according to NCAA’s AVCA Coaches’ rankings — this weekend at the Galen Center. 
The Trojans face the 17-1 Bears Friday night before taking on the 13-3 powerhouse Cardinal Sunday afternoon.
This weekend is an opportunity for a USC team that entered the season with high expectations to right the ship after what has been a disappointing start. USC still has hopes of competing for the Pac-12 title and making a run deep into the NCAA tournament. 
Six of the Trojans’ seven losses have been to teams currently ranked in the Top 25. The only other loss USC has suffered so far was a five-set loss to UCLA. The Trojans have just one win against a ranked team — a four-set victory over No. 9 Washington at the end of September. 
The tough early schedule may prove to be an advantage for USC as conference play continues. USC will have more experience against top-level talent than other teams who played an easier schedule before Pac-12 competition. 
Cal has faced just three ranked teams so far this season, losing to Stanford 3-1 and beating Washington State and Utah in five sets. 
The Trojans bring momentum into this weekend’s matches after defeating Oregon State 3-1 and sweeping Oregon last weekend.
“The offense is coming along,” head coach Brent Crouch said. “In both those matches we were able to hold both those teams to fairly low hitting efficiencies, and that is starting to look better, the defense is really starting to look better.”
USC’s defense at the net has been a consistent advantage for the team. The Trojans have 186.5 total blocks this season while their opponents have 133.5. 
Strong defense will be important when facing a tough middle-hitting team in the Bears. Cal relies heavily on two middle blockers, senior Savannah Rennie and junior Preslie Anderson.
“[The Bears] have got exceptional middle attackers, and when they are able to pass well, they can get the ball to them; they are really really physical and really good,” Crouch said. “If we can serve them and keep them off the net a little bit, that will help us a lot.”
Every service for the Trojans is essential; if the Bears can make accurate passes off the serve, they will be able to set up their powerful middles for easy scores. USC will need to maximize service opportunities from freshman outside hitter Emilia Weske and sophomore setter Raquel Lázaro — two of the team’s most potent servers.
“I think if we can win the serve pass battle versus Cal, our pins our better than theirs, we are better at the antennas than they are,” Crouch said.
Facing Stanford poses a tougher challenge for the Trojans. Stanford is the reigning NCAA champion but has shown a slight regression this season. The Cardinal have three losses, but each of those came against teams ranked in the top 12. 
“Stanford is a little bit more stacked all the way around, so that’ll challenge us all over the floor,” Crouch said. “So we will have to play our best to beat them.”
Sunday will be a battle of two of the conference’s best players. Stanford senior outside hitter Kathryn Plummer leads the Pac-12 with 5.18 kills per set. USC senior outside hitter Khalia Lanier is fourth in the conference in that category with 4.39 kills per set. 
The Cardinal have won the past six matchups against USC and have not lost to an unranked opponent since October 2016. 
First serve against Cal is at 8 p.m. before Stanford visits for a 1 p.m. start Sunday.

The Trojans are in Boulder this weekend to take on Colorado in their second Friday night game of the season. 
USC (4-3, 3-1 in the Pac-12), although undefeated at home this season, has yet to win a road game. The Trojans have won the last 13 games in their series against Colorado (3-4, 1-3 in the Pac-12), and this game is another stepping stone on their quest for a Pac-12 title. 
This season has been laden with injuries for the Trojans, testing the team’s depth. This week, USC will feel the absence of tailbacks redshirt freshman Markese Stepp and junior Stephen Carr. This comes after already losing redshirt junior Vavae Malepeai to knee surgery.
Following the injuries to USC’s three go-to backs, running backs coach Mike Jinks said the team’s mindset is “next man up.”
The running back void will be filled by freshman Kenan Christon, who lit up Arizona in his college debut Saturday with two touchdowns.
Despite their limited resources at running back, the Trojans will still make an effort to put the ball on the ground to support freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis, who struggled to move the ball in the early going against Arizona.
“I think it’s important for us to run the football because as a quarterback, it’s hard to be on every night,” offensive coordinator Graham Harrell said. “At any position, it’s hard to be on every night. It’s just when you’re the quarterback everyone sees it a lot more … If you ever have a night where the quarterback is struggling a little bit, you can help him settle in and you can take some pressure off of him if you can run the football successfully.”
On defense, the Trojans will certainly feel the loss of freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson, who leads the team in sacks, and sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga, who is second on the team in solo tackles with 32.
“It’s going to take some time [to get them healthy],” head coach Clay Helton said. “We’re going to believe in the kids that are out here. Hopefully, we’ll get some back here soon.”
Although there’s been upheaval at quarterback, with Slovis, sophomore JT Daniels and redshirt junior Matt Fink all are taking significant snaps this season, Slovis looks to be “the guy” for the rest of the season, coming in at No. 7 in the country in completion percentage at 73.6%. Despite his strong showings thus far, Slovis said that being more consistent and staying disciplined are two of his focuses heading into Colorado. 
Unlike USC, which just picked up a decisive win, Colorado enters this weekend coming off an ugly loss to Washington State. The Trojans have proven to be quite resilient this season, and despite losing plenty of familiar faces to injury, this game will likely follow tradition and not be the first time the program drops a game to the Buffaloes. 
The Trojans are optimistic heading into this matchup against Colorado, despite having many crucial players sidelined. Slovis said spirits on the team are still high.
“From the beginning with JT going down, your starting quarterback gets hurt, you never want to see that,” he said. “Then to have your first three running backs go down, again you never want to see that happen. But you have to move up and have that ‘next man up’ mentality.”
Helton said the team is focused on making the most of its opportunity to earn a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game at the end of the season.
“As a coach, we’re not paid to make excuses,” he said. “We’re paid to find answers, and we’ll find those answers. We’ve got a huge opportunity that stands right there for us. We can write our own story right now.”

Mental health is a community issue. That’s what staff members told an audience of 10 students at an Undergraduate Student Government town hall for mental health and well-being Thursday evening.
USG Vice President Mahin Tahsin, who moderated the event, said hosting more town halls is one of the USG administration’s goals this year, since that is one of the vice presidential responsibilities in the USG bylaws. 
Kelly Greco, USC Student Health’s assistant director of outreach and prevention services, began the event by discussing some mental health resources the University currently offers, including anonymous counseling services and the Healthy Minds survey, which will be taken again in the spring. 
After polling  4,560 students, the 2018 survey reported that 45% of USC students had positive mental health, including a top rate of 50% for straight women and a low rate of 32% for LGBTQ+ students. By race and ethnicity, 62% of Black students reported having positive mental health while only 36% of international students did so. 
Ilene Rosenstein, associate vice provost for campus wellbeing and education, presented a video about a new artificial intelligence tool dubbed “Ask Ari,” which will launch Nov. 1 as a tool for students to “reflect on the issues that they’re having.” It includes an interactive chat service for students to discuss their emotional well-being and learn about campus support resources. 
Counseling and Mental Health Director Broderick Leaks said the University is also building an outpatient clinic at the Engemann Student Health Center for longer term mental health care. He said the clinic will have a soft opening by the end of the semester and will be fully operational in 2021. 
One student said she and others have experienced frustration with the 30-minute phone consultation that students are required to take part in before scheduling an appointment. She said the system often requires students to go through the process twice, and another student added that online or in-person consultations would be helpful for students with social anxiety. 
“The reason why we switched to that model was because years ago … we had so much demand and so many students seeking services that students were waiting a month before they even talked to us the first time,” Leaks responded. 
Leaks said that under the new system, most students can schedule appointments within a few days. 
“We are looking at different ways of doing that,” Leaks said. “I know some of the feedback that we get is very frustrating … so we are definitely looking at shifts to our model.”
Julia Kuhn, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said she wished the event had been more of a discussion instead of a presentation. She said she found the presentation to be vague and wished the explanations of the University’s mental health services had been “more thorough.”
“I feel a lot of times they said, ‘We’re working on them,’ very vaguely, but not really going into detail [about] what it meant,” Kuhn said.

Vice President of Admissions and Planning Katharine Harrington will step down in June 2020, Provost Charles Zukoski announced Thursday. Harrington oversees the offices of Admission, Financial Aid, Institutional Research and the Registrar, as well as Orientation and Welcome Week programs.
Under Harrington, who previously served as dean of admission and financial aid, USC’s acceptance rate decreased from 27% to 11%, standardized test scores for admitted students rose from the 87th to the 96th percentile and the University’s graduation rate increased. She has served in the role since August 2010. 
“On behalf of the USC community, I express our deepest gratitude for her extraordinary work and our enormous pride in what she has accomplished over the past 15 years as our chief enrollment officer,” Zukoski wrote. “She has been an essential part of USC’s growth into a top-tier global university.”
According to the memo, Harrington will take a sabbatical and then return to teach at the Marshall School of Business, where she is currently a professor of clinical management and organization. Harrington also holds an academic appointment in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. 
The University has not announced Harrington’s successor, and said the administration will keep the community informed on the selection process. 
“She provided the leadership and the strategic guidance that has transformed our undergraduate population into one of the most geographically, socioeconomically and culturally inclusive student bodies in the country,” Zukowski wrote. “Her work has strengthened our university community, bolstered our academic achievements and heightened the quality of the student experience. She simultaneously developed financial aid strategies that have ensured all of our students receive as much support from us as possible.”
USC declined to comment, and Dean of Admissions Timothy Brunold could not be reached for comment. 
The announcement comes months after an FBI investigation revealed a college admissions scheme that allowed wealthy parents to pay to falsify their children’s test scores and bribe athletic officials to get their children a spot at elite universities such as USC, Stanford University and Yale University.
USC was the most implicated University in the investigation, and multiple high-ranking officials and coaches in the Athletics Department have been terminated and charged. Since the investigation, USC’s admissions processes have been under intense scrutiny. 
Former interim president Wanda Austin announced sweeping admissions reforms, including changes in the relationship between the Office of Admission and the Athletics Department. 
Since the selection of Carol Folt as president, multiple administrative officials have stepped down. Provost Michael Quick and Senior Vice President for Legal Affairs Carol Mauch Amir retired in June and Athletic Director Lynn Swann resigned earlier this month.

Down a grassy path beside the Parkside dining hall lies one of USC’s hidden treasures: the Parkside Garden, a secluded area devoid of the manicured hedges that line much of campus. Instead, the garden is a natural haven of raised beds, a self-sustaining aquaponics system — and it’s full of bins of decomposing food waste.
According to Garden Club president Zannatul Zannat, compost bins have been in the Parkside Garden since the garden’s early days, years before the club’s founding in Spring 2019. Originally installed as part of a partnership with LA Compost, the compost system was left untended to as student involvement in the garden dwindled.
However, with the establishment of the Garden Club, the compost bins are back in use, breaking down food waste from the University community. While some of the composted material is Zannat’s own — she said she brings in the food waste from the Eco-op, where she lives — much of it is other students’ own scraps.
“People will actually save their food scraps and Tupperware and just take it to the compost system,” said Milena Castillo-Grynberg, vice president of the Garden Club and a senior majoring in environmental studies. “A lot of the pushback about composting is that people won’t want to do it because it’s gross or whatever, but people don’t really mind, and it’s not that bad because once you get it in there, you don’t need to deal with it anymore. You just close it up and hand-turn it.”
Zannat said the Garden Club is working on initiatives to promote composting on campus, encouraging students, faculty and Facilities Management Services staff to use the bins. Castillo-Grynberg said a large part of the initiative is spreading awareness about the garden’s compost system and educating members of the USC community about what types of food waste can be composted.
“We just want students to know that the space there exists,” Castillo-Grynberg said. “We want to have workshops for students about effectively composting, what they can compost, how to apply compost to your crops or like generally just how to improve your compost and the importance of composting.”
Zannat, a senior majoring in environmental studies, first learned of the garden as a junior while working on a research project about aquaponics with the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies. 
“I came here to just check on [the system] … one day, this was exactly one year ago I think, one day I came by, and the aquaponics system was completely drained, and there was like dried, dead fish stuck to the bottom of it,” Zannat said. “I was just like, ‘How could we have let this happen? Like, who let this happen?’”
Zannat began looking into the system’s upkeep and discovered that until that point, no one had been in charge of maintaining the aquaponics system — or the rest of the garden — so she decided to create a club devoted to caring for the garden. She co-founded the Garden Club in Spring 2019 with an initial membership of six students. Since then, it has grown to an estimated 86 members.
“So when I was working with Wrigley [Institute], working on their aquaponics system, I saw that this whole space was kind of neglected,” Zannat said. “There wasn’t really anything growing. It was taken over by weeds, and the compost systems were just kind of rotting there because if you don’t turn it, it does just rot, and it won’t turn into good compost.”
After discovering the dilapidated state of the compost bins, Zannat decided to spearhead the revival of the composting system for a class service project.
“Once I got that started, it kind of snowballed from there because I was like, ‘I’m reviving the compost system,’ right, reviving the aquaponics system and trying to get more interest for people to help me with the rest of the garden,” Zannat said.
As part of its composting initiative, the Garden Club is working to develop more partnerships with both USC and the surrounding community. Castillo-Grynberg said the club has started discussing the possibility of teaming up with USC Hospitality to compost some of the dining halls’ scraps, although the compost system’s size would limit the amount of food waste that could be processed.
According to Castillo-Grynberg, composting is economically efficient as well, saving money on a high quality natural fertilizer that would otherwise cost a hefty sum if purchased on the market.
“[Compost is] considered like brown gold by gardeners because it’s so good for your plants, and that’s just a resource that you’re throwing away,” Castillo-Grynberg said. “And now we’re seeing massive topsoil loss globally, we’re seeing our soil is really depleted.”
Castillo-Grynberg said the organic material composted at the garden is put to good use in the beds, naturally enriching the soil and eliminating the need for chemical fertilizer.
“Natural fertilizers are just super damaging for ecosystems when you’re putting it in,” Castillo-Grynberg said. “There’s a much more natural way to grow really, really healthy crops that we’ve just completely been sleeping on.” 
The benefits of composting go beyond the environmental and economic impact of the composted matter. According to Castillo-Grynberg, the cyclical nature of consumption and compost can be therapeutic.
“There’s something really meditative about composting and just kind of like closing the loop on the cycle of what you’re consuming and recycling,” Castillo-Grynberg said. “It’s really exciting to have your compost come out and just see that you created dirt from food waste and that you can put that back into your garden and then get food back from it.”

Ground Zero Performance Café was bursting Tuesday night as students from all corners of the USC campus flocked to see comedian, actor and television host Nicole Byer’s stand-up comedy show. Colorful hanging lights, upbeat throwback tunes and lively conversation cut through the usually dimly lit performance space. Resounding applause erupted as Byer took the stage. 
To kick off the show, Byer jumped headlong into a selection of personal anecdotes ranging from her travels through rural America while on tour, a traumatizing experience with a game of “Power Hour” in Chicago, which ended in the destruction of a public toilet and some reflections on the consistently ridiculous relationships found in Disney princess movies: older women hating on younger women, catfishing and men who refuse to grow up and fail to understand what it is women truly want. In Sleeping Beauty’s case, as Byer put it, men should know to never come between women and their naps. 
“We [women] already know what men want,” Byer said. After a slight pause and mischievous smile, Byer launched into a slew of penis jokes that had the audience howling with laughter. 
The event was hosted by the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment as part of its Body Love Month initiative. SAGE recognizes that everyone’s experience with their body is unique and aims to represent many diverse viewpoints at their events.  
“We try to make [our events] as accessible as possible with regards to all sorts of identities, disabilities [and] perspective,” said Gwen Howard, SAGE’s Body Love Director. “We want to make sure that everyone gets the message.” 
With such a diverse professional background, Byer fits the bill when it comes to bringing a fresh perspective to the table. In addition to her comedic abilities, Byer is best known for her appearance on MTV’s “Girl Code” and for her role as the host of Netflix’s bake-off show “Nailed It!” where, Byer jokes, “contestants compete to serve me poison.” Outside of her work on television, Byer has three podcasts, “90 Day Bae,” “Best Friends! With Sasheer Zamata” and “Why Won’t You Date Me?” 
Byer is one of the more high-profile guests that SAGE has brought to campus for Body Love Month, and the group believes that she is an important voice and grounded presence in the era of body acceptance. 
“She speaks so authentically, or at least from a place where she doesn’t seem to censor herself based on what might be conventional,” Howard said. “She represents a lot of what I think is a really realistic and feasible way for USC students, [and other] college students, to start embracing their bodies for what they are. There’s a lot of pressure to conform, obviously, but it goes so much deeper than that. It’s not just about, ‘I don’t feel pretty.’ It’s about, ‘what subliminal messages am I sending to myself about how I feel I look?’” 
The show’s momentum picked up during its second half when audience members were treated to a story of Byer pushing herself outside her comfort zone by taking a twerking class in which she happened to be the only black woman in the class. Byer said she took it in stride because she “sucks up white women power,” and despite learning that she did not have the natural twerking rhythm, she still viewed it as a fun and entertaining experience. 
While the audience’s overall reaction during the show was positive and every joke was met with chuckles, Byer garnered the most laughs from her reflections on single life. She shared her thoughts on observing couples in the wild, tricking men into relationships with “chill vibes” and the curious interactions one can have on dating apps. At one point, Byer asked the audience members to share their own traumatic online dating experiences, leaving audience members and Byer cringing and practically rolling on the floor in fits of laughter. 
To end the show, Byer shared a recent “rock bottom” moment in which she got drunk off of travel-size vodkas on a red-eye flight and ended up eating Shake Shack in an airport bathroom stall while crying and singing to herself, much to the horror of fellow travelers. 
From this experience and the others she shared with the crowd — although not exclusively focused on discussing body acceptance — Byer’s overarching message was clear: You have to own it. 
“Not everything she does is about her identity,” Howard said. “It’s a big piece of it, and it will color everything she does, but she’s also frickin’ funny, and I think that’s also important — to bring high-quality entertainment and have fun talking about things that need more of a platform.”
For those who were familiar with her work before the show, Byer’s performance was thoroughly enjoyable and just what they expected. 
“I always knew her comedy was very personal and raunchy, so it wasn’t terribly surprising,” said audience member Imani Davis, a senior majoring in political science and law, history and culture. “She sounded the same way she does when she’s cracking jokes on her podcast.” 
After this event, SAGE hopes the conversation about body love will continue beyond October. 
“The purpose of Body Love Month is to start the conversation and the rest of the year is for continuing it,” Howard said. “We hope that people engage with us in this space and come to our events this week and next week and hopefully we can spark some change.”

Just over a week ago, Playboi Carti posted a selfie to his Instagram with an elusive caption: “<48 hours! locked in.” His fanbase quickly took this as a sign — Carti was finally dropping his long-awaited album, “Whole Lotta Red,” after months of teasing its release. As usual, we were wrong. Forty-eight hours came and went, and there was no album in sight. While his followers may have been disappointed, they showed no sign of giving up. In fact, it seems they are now more impatient than ever for the project to drop. 
Carti’s not the only rapper notorious for painfully delaying a release. Fans have been waiting more than two years for Lil Uzi’s follow-up to “Luv is Rage 2,” “Eternal Atake,” and Ye has promised several dates for his gospel album, “Jesus is King, which dropped Friday after a year’s wait. Frank Ocean has only dropped two albums to date, and the vague, mysterious content he posts always leaves fans wondering, “Where the hell is this man’s music?” Yet we are still loyally awaiting these projects with more anticipation and excitement than we had to begin with. 
There is a pattern at work here, and I want to address it: Some prolific hip-hop artists are infamous for not dropping their music on time, and it is only making them bigger and bigger. Isn’t that weird? A musician is supposed to make musical content, right? So why is refraining from doing the main thing that their career depends on making them more popular? 
If you ask me, I think it has a lot to do with the way my generation — Gen Z — operates. I don’t mean to be harsh, but a lot of us love, even actively seek out, clout and exclusivity. Whether it’s the most limited-edition fashion — think Warren Lotas and other high-profile, small-scale brands — or the most elite food and nightlife spots, people love to be in on the gimmick, especially when not just anyone can be. And what’s more exclusive, more unattainable and limited, than something that quite literally doesn’t exist yet?
Imagine how big those albums will be: “Whole Lotta Red,” “Eternal Atake,” “Jesus is King” and Frank Ocean’s unnamed third project. When they ultimately do drop, they will produce seismic waves in the hip-hop and social media worlds. These artists are generating hype in ridiculous amounts, easily gaining more fans than they are losing during the wait, and I think it’s a cool trick.
I’m not sure whether what’s going on is simply due to laziness on the artists’ part, issues with their label or a calculated marketing ploy, but the gag is that it doesn’t matter. Whatever it is, it’s working, and it’s working perfectly. 
In fact, it is becoming a common trope — one that serves to distinguish these artists from their timely counterparts. Sure, fans get annoyed, sure, when their favorite rapper fails to come through on yet another promised release date, but at the same time, it builds the allure of “the project that simply won’t drop.” The longer the wait, the more the perceived significance and quality of the music grows. I have no idea what Uzi’s “Eternal Atake” will look or sound like, yet I’m convinced it’ll be his best album yet and for no good reason at all, really. 
At its crux, I see this as a testament to the evolution of art into stranger and more obscure forms. 
Postmodern art is about the contradictory — that which strays from what art is meant to look like. Intentionally screwing with one’s album release is more than just a publicity stunt. These artists are generating fame, exposure and buzz with the help of a gimmick that is not traditionally defined as an artistic technique but is slowly becoming one.
The impact of a musical project now goes beyond its content; it is largely about the process of the buildup, too. It is the most counterintuitive, effective music marketing I’ve ever witnessed: the art of not dropping music.

The 2018 midterm election brought a record number of women running for office, and with that wave came a Netflix documentary written, directed and produced by Rachel Lears. 
“Knock Down The House” follows the campaigns of four women running for congressional office in the 2018 midterm election, including the story of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s upset victory in New York’s 14th Congressional District as she defeated chairman of the House Democratic Caucus Joe Crowley. The documentary follows Cortez, Cori Bush, Amy Vilela and Paula Jean Swearengin’s campaigning efforts, as well as their triumphs and losses along the way. 
The School of Cinematic Arts held a special screening for the documentary Tuesday, with a Q&A session featuring Lears. Jessica Burgess, a sophomore majoring in cinema and media studies, said she was thrilled at the opportunity to discuss the filmmaking process and the role of gender in politics with the director herself. 
“In such a divisive time, it’s really interesting to watch a journey of these women actually making it and changing the forum and changing the platform of what’s happening in politics,’’ Burgess said. “So I think to watch these women fight for [hope and diversity] can be inspirational.’’
The cast of the film alone is inspirational. All come from incredibly diverse backgrounds, with a waitress in the Bronx, a coal miner’s daughter in West Virginia, a woman in Nevada who lost her daughter to a broken healthcare system and a registered nurse from Missouri who helped those affected in the Ferguson riots in 2014. All of them are linked by one common thread: their determination to fight the establishment.
With such a diverse cast, the theme of intersectionality is evident in the documentary, and Lears succeeds in conveying the message of the importance of diversity in politics. The film highlights grassroots campaigns: none of the four women took money from corporations, building their campaign from the ground up and proving themselves as worthy candidates despite coming from nonpolitical, working-class backgrounds. 
“The idea was always to do something that was truly intersectional by showing the intersection of gender not just with race but also with economic issues, and all of their stories really brought forward those themes,” Lears said. 
Lears said her team searched for a cast by first reaching out to the Justice Democrats and Brand New Congress, who were on the lookout for working-class individuals who could serve as potential candidates for office. 
“We were interested in the idea of solidarity, of people coming together from different backgrounds from different locations in this national project and of course, as filmmakers, we knew there would be these individual arcs of what’s it gonna be like for a regular person to try and transform themselves into a viable candidate,’’ Lears said.
Lears said it took interviewing 24 candidates to get to the final four. The result, she said, is a story of characters with compelling, emotional story arcs.
“These four really jumped out for a few reasons,” Lears said. “One, because they all have really strong personal stories of their motivations for running, and we knew that that would make them compelling to watch, win or lose.”
Being the primary person on set allowed Lears to build intimate relationships with the four women; their candor and vulnerability in the film ultimately became one of the strongest parts of the documentary.
‘’I think as you go through [the campaign] with them the intimacy builds,’’ Lears said. “Going through the election night for each of them even with the different outcomes, that builds intimacy as well because after that, you’ve been through this thing with them that’s one of the most significant things they’ve ever done in their life.’’
Prerika Chawla, a junior majoring in cognitive science, said the movie feels honest and transparent.
“This is their direct voice,” Chawla said. “It’s not coming through a filtered media page or something that a journalist wrote about them. It’s them speaking directly to the audience.”
Lears said she had to establish certain boundaries during production when documenting incredibly emotional moments for the candidates running. 
“In the case of Amy, I mean, I took a step back, because I didn’t want the camera in her face,” Lears said about the night of Vilela’s loss. “I got that shot, and then I turned it off and I left.”
Whether it be the loss of a family member, growing up in incredibly unfortunate financial circumstances or growing up in an area where your race automatically puts you at a disadvantage, these women had to endure extreme circumstances to get to where they are, Lears said. 
In a scene where Cortez makes a phone call to Vilela, she says, “It’s just the reality that in order for one of us to make it through, 100 of us have to try.”

As colorful beams of light framed a stage blanketed by haze, student performers entertained a small audience with original poetry and musical numbers at the Queer and Ally Student Assembly’s Open Mic Night. Most read lines off their phones, a testament to the casual vibe at the Ground Zero Performance Café Wednesday evening. 
With an audience of about 20 people — many of whom were performers themselves — the event did not last the entire two and a half hours allotted. But for QuASA Director Steven Vargas, the show’s lead organizer, the event represented more than just an opportunity for exposure.
“It’s a space where these queer students can voice their identity and their art that is specific to who they are freely on stage,” he said. 
Vargas, a senior majoring in theatre and journalism, said that he was introduced to USC’s queer community at his first QuASA Open Mic Night as a freshman three years ago. Since then, he’s viewed it as an important staple of the fall semester, especially during October, which is National Coming Out Month.
With only a few acts signed up to perform, a couple students took to the stage more than once. One senior majoring in music industry, who was introduced under the stage moniker “wren,” first read poetry — some original, some not — then performed his original song, “I Lost Myself in Finding You.”
Drag queen Blanche Devereaux, a freshman majoring in economics and theatre, began with a lip synced version of “When You’re Good to Mama,” from the musical Chicago. In a black silk robe and thigh-high boots, they strutted across the stage using only a small handkerchief as a prop, and the small crowd cheered and clapped enthusiastically.
Later in the evening, they returned to the stage for an improvised standup routine about their upbringing in a conservative part of Texas. 
“My mother wonders, ‘What did I do to make my son gay?’” they quipped. “You read Edgar Allen Poe to me as a child.”
Yocelyn Pina, a freshman majoring in architecture, read two original poems: One about immigration and another about her sister. Titled “Yellow Target,” the former told the story of her indigenous heritage and her family’s history immigrating to the United States. 
“To the people who have referred to us as thieves in the night creeping into your country, stealing your jobs and your money,” she said, “we are escaping countries where corruption, violence and poverty have given us no other alternative than to drop down to our knees and worship an implausible American dream.”
Daisy Tichenor, a sophomore majoring in theatre, performed “For Good,” from the musical “Wicked,” with her friend and non-USC student Gracie Nayman. Before beginning the duet, a song of reconciliation between the Wicked Witch of the West and good witch Galinda, Tichenor joked about their history as best friends.
“Gracie and I met freshman year of high school and we told each other that we had a ‘friend crush’ on each other,” Tichenor said. “And we’ve recently realized that that was repressed homosexuality, and that we should have dated in high school — it would have been the perfect time.” 
Leslie White Moon, a sophomore majoring in occupational therapy who did not perform, said that although she arrived late, she enjoyed seeing performers “doing what they liked to do.”
“Because [QuASA]’s specifically such an open community and one that’s really supportive of everybody that’s going to be here, I feel like it’s something that anybody could really do,” White Moon said. “I feel like it’s something that’s fun and more community-oriented than just about the performing.”

Many who do not live in Los Angeles think the city is paradise. They believe all Angelenos do is drink boba in Little Tokyo, dance in West Hollywood and catch some waves in Santa Monica. Are Angelenos immune to what life throws at them? How is it that our families are any less dysfunctional than others? Our heartbreaks less painful? Our diseases less fatal? 
For the past few years, many Angelenos have been living in a “paradise” of tent cities. The homeless crisis in L.A. has now become a humanitarian one. According to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, an estimated 50,000 to 60,000 persons can be found experiencing homelessness on a given night. 
In an op-ed written by the Sacramento mayor Darrell Steinburg, the deaths among those who are unsheltered in L.A. are up 76% over the last five years. Desperate for solutions, L.A. officials such as County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and City Councilman Joe Buscaino have recently called upon California Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare the L.A. homelessness crisis a state of emergency. Even though it sounds like a solution, this cavalry call is simply a press release. 
Yes, the declaration of a state of emergency sounds as if it would hasten and assist efforts to solve the crisis that pervades the sidewalks, riverbeds and parks of L.A. But that’s only if that declaration had come five or so years ago. Through Proposition HHH, the city has already invested $1.2 billion in housing those affected by homelessness and those who are low-income. Another legislative act, Measure H, will allow L.A. to spend several billions of dollars on services and rental assistance.
Even more, declaring a state of emergency does not allow for tapping into federal funds. According to Federal Emergency Management Agency, cities and counties are the only entities that obtain federal emergency aid, not the state. Further, the Trump administration has already denied a request by Newsom for more housing vouchers for people experiencing homelessness, and this is not the first time Newsom has hit roadblocks in attempting to solve a homeless crisis. Newsom served as the mayor of San Francisco from 2004 to 2011 before serving as lieutenant governor and now governor of California. 
According to The Sacramento Bee, Newsom, as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, introduced the wildly controversial “Care Not Cash” policy a year before his first mayoral run in San Francisco. This policy stripped people affected by homelessness of the $400 welfare payments that came from the city in exchange for housing and treatment. Critics say that the policy made people experiencing homelessness worse off, put more strain on the city’s shelter system and fell short on the promise of supportive housing. All in all, Newsom failed to end the chronic homeless crisis in his own backyard. Homelessness grew under his watch, according to The Sacramento Bee. Over 6,000 people made up the homeless population of San Francisco during Newsom’s first term as mayor of San Francisco in 2004; that same population numbered 6,455 on Newsom’s first day as lieutenant governor in 2011.
L.A. must stop looking to the state capital for help when it is perfectly able to help itself. A declaration of a state of emergency is “political catwalking,” that will most assuredly not fix the homeless crisis. The bureaucratic energy taken by the L.A. City Council in calling on Newsom would be better utilized in actually fixing the problems themselves. 
The ineptness of the city council has led many people, such as activist Scott Presler, in organizing 200 volunteers to clean up the trash that festers in homeless encampments while also handing out small meals to those affected by homelessness. “Stop talking, start doing,” Presler said as he and others cleared over 50 tons of garbage. Yes, the road to solving the crisis is an uphill battle, but local governments cannot look for a buttress from the state government. It’s up to local officials to be better at their jobs. 
L.A. is preparing to host the 2028 Summer Olympics, and it is an Olympic feat itself to simply raise funds in order to adequately host the games. World media and national press will be around every juice bar and yoga studio in L.A. reporting on the happenings of the games and the conditions of the city itself. If the City of Angels wishes to save its reputation as a gleaming city upon a hill, then it must uplift its fallen angels. Cameras will be flashing like the golden sun that shines on the faces of those who have lost the golden dream.

A false alarm on Fluor Tower’s Latinx floor, El Sol y La Luna, triggered massive flooding last Tuesday after the fire alarm was set off. Due to the sheer amount of water, 32 students were relocated to New North and South Residential Colleges.
And the damages were not only physical — apparently, the rate of flooding was great enough to unearth residents’ well-buried racism. Instead of uniting as a community during the ordeal, some Fluor students felt it was justified to attack their fellow residents. That same night, memes targeting the floor were posted on social media, followed by a petition calling for the immediate eviction of students responsible for the flooding.
One meme included Larry the Lobster from Spongebob and the message: “You can’t make tamales at 3 a.m. and then forget to turn off the microwave.” The other image was of the “Hellmo” picture and read, “There are enemies among us … it appears as though tamales were made improperly in suite 608.”
This was no case of microaggression, where the bounds of political correctness and racism are blurred by societal normalcy. The memes and petition were acts of blatant antagonism, attacking West Residential College’s Latinx floor with cultural stereotypes. They reeked of ignorance, the favored perfume of the privileged. 
Regardless of the mistakes made by the students who inadvertently triggered the fire alarm, such a negatively charged response is unacceptable — especially from members of a student body who, according to USC News, sold itself as “empathetic” and “caring” to USC on its applications. In truth, the whole situation displays the offending students’ inability to express their frustrations through mature channels.
An email was later sent out to students in West Residential College addressing the night’s events and students’ concerns — due procedure in such circumstances. However, the incident’s  implications have exceeded the limits of West Residential College. Because of the student-made memes, misinformation concerning the cause of the flooding has dispersed campuswide. This perpetuation of destructive stereotypes only gives power to this ignorant attempt at humor.
Despite technically being adults, USC students are somewhat shielded from the realities of greater society. Within the bubble of campus life, it seems that people have confused the right to free speech with freedom from repercussion. Anonymity does not equal invincibility, and there must be consequences for one’s actions — especially when said actions involve rhetoric that encourages racist stereotypes.
It is the University’s responsibility to uphold certain standards of conduct among its student population, one of which is respect for others and their cultural backgrounds. Amid conversations of racism concerning USC’s John Wayne exhibit and the slow-moving procession toward Von KleinSmid Center’s name change, the University needs to take an active role in the resolution of this situation. 
If measures cannot be taken against the perpetrator(s), the University needs to make a more public statement to the student body. This is an absolute necessity — not only to dispel misinterpretations of the night’s events but to quash any illusions that such forms of hate are accepted within the so-called Trojan Family.
This article was updated to reflect that the causing of flooding has not been stated. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

At USC, half of transfer students come from California community colleges. Transferring to a four-year university from a community college is becoming more and more popular these days, especially with rising tuition at higher education institutions. That said, many four-year universities pride themselves on being “transfer-friendly” institutions — USC especially. 
The University boasts the Transfer Student Community to “enrich [the] academic, social and personal life of transfer students at USC.” This makes it easier to meet other transfer students to create a more welcoming and inclusive community on campus. Yet, transfer students are not extended a forgiveness policy like freshmen when they retake a class to improve a grade even though CCC transfer students are also first-time four-year university students. This policy needs to be revised to include them. 
Aside from the social and environmental changes coming into a four-year, transfer students are often met with the expectation of immediate adjustment. Arguably, classes at a community college in comparison to a four-year may be less rigorous and demanding. Thus, the transition from the academic environment of a community college to that of USC can be hard and may cause transfer students to struggle with adjusting to class rigor and requirements. It can be enough to potentially cause a student to receive a failing grade during the first year of transitioning and readjusting. However, freshmen have more leverage here. 
Freshmen may repeat a maximum of three courses taken during the first two semesters if they received a grade of D+ or lower. The first grade will be eliminated from the GPA — but still reflected on transcripts  — and only the subsequent grade will be calculated into the GPA, even if it is lower. This policy, which is extended to spring admits, is not extended to transfer students, even though they are also first-time, four-year students. 
It’s difficult to understand why Freshman Forgiveness, or a similar concept, isn’t an option for transfer students. According to the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, many other four-year universities already permit all undergraduate and some graduate students to have their low grades forgiven through a second chance. For this reason, the University too, must implement such policy for transfer students’ benefit. 
Having the forgiveness open only to freshmen is discriminatory and unfair. This extension can benefit a large part of the transfer population at USC, which would make USC more of a “transfer-friendly” school than it claims to be now. 
Transfer orientation and outreach programs are great, but they don’t account for the academic aid many transfer students may need. Adjusting is not always easy, but they shouldn’t prevent someone from being able to succeed in their college education. A failing grade on a transcript can create difficulties for those interested in pursuing graduate studies or obtaining internships. Many competitive programs require a minimum GPA to apply so a poor grade in a class or two can really deplete one’s overall GPA. 
USC claims to be an inclusive school, and though in many ways it is, the transfer student population lacks equal opportunity. Freshmen are coming into a new environment, adjusting socially, emotionally and academically, and are given more aid to succeed through the forgiveness policy. Aren’t transfer students going through the same motions? They are faced with more pressure to not fail a class because there’s no going back from it. How is that inclusive? How is that fair? 
USC is ranked as No. 22 national university in the 2020 edition of Best Colleges, but it can be better if community college transfers are allotted a second chance to succeed.
