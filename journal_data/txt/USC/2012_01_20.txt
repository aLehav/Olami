The 2012 Sundance Film Festival kicked off Thursday with tons of films that sound both promising and intriguing.
The films that premiere in Sundance are eventually released in the United States toward the fall – that’s hoping they find a distributor there, if they don’t already have one – and usually sparks become game changers for awards season. Like Crazy, last year’s Sundance charmer, didn’t quite find love when the film was released in October, but previous films such as Precious and Winter’s Bone have successfully kept their fire burning all the way up toward the Oscars.
Bridesmaids was a critical and commercial success and could potentially gain an Oscar nomination for Best Picture, considering its Producers Guild of America nomination. Bachelorette is a similar film, focused on a group of women embarking on a self-destructive journey, though initial word is that it’s not necessarily a knockoff, because the idea was in place before Bridesmaids. The film stars Kirsten Dunst, Isla Fisher and Lizzy Caplan in what could be this summer’s big comedy film.
Spike Lee is back into filmmaking mode with his latest independent film, Red Hook Summer. The film is his first narrative film in four years, in which the character of Mookie is said to return. The film still doesn’t have distribution, however, he should have no problem with this one.
Andy Samberg and Rashida Jones team up in Celeste and Jesse Forever, a film that pairs them together as former high school sweethearts who are going through a divorce. The potential here is that Andy Samberg will have a lead role to shine in, providing us with hopefully some heartbreak and humor.
Elizabeth Olsen and Josh Radnor made waves at last year’s Sundance with Martha Marcy May Marlene and happythankyoumoreplease, respectively. They will now star together in Liberal Arts, a film that centers on a 35-year-old man who falls for a college student when he returns to his alma matter. Elizabeth Olsen is a promising star and this film could potentially show us her in a different light.

On January 19th, it was announced that Rupert Murdoch and News International has agreed to pay cash to the dozens of people – including Jude Law and Danii Minogue – harassed and hacked by the titles in his corporation.
News Corp was famously thrown in for a loop last summer. Once allegations of illegal activity arose, all the respect for the conglomerate had seemed to dissipate.
Surprisingly, Hugh Grant was one of the first to out the company by wiring himself and interviewing a “reporter”, where he caught him admitting that they hack phones, delete voicemails and set up illegal activity in order to get the scoop.
Countless American celebrities complain about the paparazzi’s presence on their front lawns. British ones, however, such as Sienna Miller and Jude Law have claimed that the British media is far worse.
While a photographer might follow you to the Beverly Center here in Los Angeles, British photographers and reporters have been known to blackmail you for an exclusive photo shoot.
So where is the line when it comes to privacy? Politicians have always been held up to a higher standard. That’s mostly because they shouldn’t be campaigning for one thing and living another.
The Oscar-winning actor Robert DeNiro famously shies away from the spotlight because he doesn’t want his personal life to ruin his presence onscreen. Other celebrities have claimed that if you don’t want to be seen, you don’t have to be.
But some have no choice. When News Corp was indicted by parliament, salacious claims came to light about their unethical practices.
Widows of the Iraq war had their phones bugged while some reporters could listen in on Prince William and Harry’s personal cellular devices.
Perhaps the worst claim was that of Milly Dowler, a thirteen-year-old girl abducted and murdered in 2002. Reporters from News of the World apparently hacked into Dowler’s phone after her disappearance and deleted voicemails, causing police and her family to think that she was still alive.
It seems as if the twenty-first century has truly become an age of shock. Where anything will sell and because of that, newspapers are willing to put in the extra illegal mile in order to obtain the best stories. Gone are the days where some modicum of privacy can be expected.
And what does that have to do with us? Well, one of News Corp’s most valued employees, Piers Morgan, recently took over Larry King’s famed show on CNN.
Morgan is now being investigated by the British parliament for his role in the hackings while he was editor of several of News Corp’s tabloids.
For those on reality shows or news programs, I suppose the story is a bit different. After all, you cannot expect to make money from being yourself and then cry out privacy issues in your “personal life.”
But for those in film, it is a problem.
Apparently, anything one can do to “get the story” is done. Because of this all or nothing approach, we cannot watch a Lindsay Lohan film without seeing the girl sprawled across the tabloids. When most of us see the new Leonardo DiCaprio film, instead of his performance, we wonder which Victoria’s Secret model he is dating.
Tabloid life and screen life have meshed together so inexplicably that it seems impossible to untangle.
And because of that, the future of media is bound to look a little bleak.
