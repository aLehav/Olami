After routing Oregon earlier in the week, the men’s basketball team fell to Oregon State 67-62 in the last home game of the season Saturday. 
Although the Beavers stormed out to a 10-point lead, the win wasn’t out of reach for the Trojans in the second half. The team chipped down the lead throughout the second, and a 3-pointer by Jonah Mathews secured a 1-point 56-55 lead with just under four minutes left to play. The 11-point swing was mainly fueled by Mathews’ accuracy, while the rest of the team struggled to score.
Much of the Trojans’ difficulty came from an inability to finish open shots. Usually a team leader in scoring, junior Nick Rakocevic finished the game with only 4 points. A lone standout in the game was the performance of freshman Kevin Porter Jr., who posted his first career double-double with 11 points and 10 rebounds on the night. But the rest of the team struggled to complete shots, especially from long distance.
“We were 6-for-25 [from 3-point range] when the game mattered,” Enfield said. “Our guys had open looks. You have to shoot better to beat a good team like Oregon State.”
The loss was the last game at Galen Center for the senior class, but it was met by a scattered crowd, with only 3,590 fans in attendance. That number was the second-lowest crowd in the 13 years since Galen Center opened — only a handful more than the record-low of 3,552 from 2014.
The lack of intensity in the stands mirrored a lack of continuity on the court, as the Trojans shot 44 percent from the field. Enfield shook his head as he studied the stat sheet after the game, regretfully admitting that his team simply missed a lot of shots. For seniors Bennie Boatwright and Shaqquan Aaron, the final home game was an emotional moment, and making it a more difficult loss to handle. 
“It’s all good — it’s all part of basketball,” Boatwright said. “You win some, you lose some. Everybody in the Galen Center who’s supported me for the last four years, I’m extremely grateful.”
After the loss, the Trojans are now 15-13 on the season, walking the line of a losing record in conference play with an 8-7 record in the Pac-12. A close loss to Oregon State, which is ranked second in the conference, wasn’t necessarily a poor result on paper, but the team failed to finish a game that they could have won, a theme throughout this season. For Enfield, the team’s up-and-down performance points primarily resulted from lack of leadership, especially after point guard Jordan McLaughlin graduated.
“If you look at championship-level teams, there’s great leadership,” Enfield said. “In the bigger picture, certain guys just need to be able to play with a more even temperament. Either you’re successful or you fail. Everybody fails. You need to grind it out and work hard and be a leader. That’s what great players do, and that’s what great teams have.”
Although this weekend marked the team’s last at Galen Center for the season, the Trojans have two more road trips to complete the regular season — one to Utah and one to Colorado. But first, they’ll have to head to Westwood to face crosstown rival UCLA on Thursday.

The USC baseball team lost two of three games against Arkansas — last season’s College World Series runner-up — over the weekend at Dedeaux Field.
The Trojans fell 6-3 Thursday night. Senior pitcher Quentin Longrie surrendered 4 earned runs through three innings as Arkansas pushed 6 runs across in the first four frames.
USC battled to cut the Razorbacks’ lead in half in the fourth inning. However, the score styed at 6-3 for the remainder of the game.
On Friday, the Trojans dropped a back-and-forth affair with a final score of 8-6. USC scored 4 runs in the bottom of the third on the strength of four hits and two Arkansas errors for a 4-1 lead. A 2-run home run by sophomore shortstop Casey Martin gave the Razorbacks the lead in the fifth inning.
After committing just two errors in the opening series against Nebraska Omaha the weekend before, the Trojans made four in the first two games against Arkansas. Head coach Dan Hubbs said the team played a little tight in those contests, resulting in the defensive miscues.
“[The cause of the errors is] more just trying too hard rather than just letting the game come to you,” Hubbs said. “We had a couple plays late that were just us trying to do too much.”
Despite the losses, Hubbs expressed confidence in the pitching staff after Friday’s game.
“I don’t think we’ve pitched as well as we’ve wanted to pitch, but I’m confident in these guys,” Hubbs said. “I think we’re a regional pitching staff, it’s just we’ve got to pitch like it.”
The Trojans did just that on Saturday. Sophomore pitcher John Beller allowed just 1 run over five innings for the Trojans. Freshman pitcher Carson Lambert gave up 1 run in one and one-third innings in relief and junior pitcher Chris Clarke allowed 1 earned run over three and two-thirds innings, allowing the Trojans to win 6-4.
Beller followed up his season opener, in which he pitched seven scoreless innings, with another impressive outing on Saturday. After his first two starts, Beller leads the starting staff with an earned run average of 0.75.
“I was really able to get a feel for what I was going to do in throwing to each guy,” Beller said. “And just like last weekend, [I had] a lot of faith in my defense.”
USC scored an early home run by senior infielder Chase Bushor in the first inning. Beller left the game after the fifth inning with a 2-1 lead. The Razorbacks tied the game in the seventh inning, and USC reclaimed the lead on a double by redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs — a pop-up that should have been caught, but dropped right next to Arkansas junior second baseman Jack Kenley.
After junior outfielder Dominic Fletcher put the Razorbacks on top with a solo home run in the 10th inning, sophomore outfielder Jamal O’Guinn tied the game again with a two-out RBI single to score junior infielder Tyler Pritchard. Stubbs capped off the eventful game with a walk-off two-run home run that just snuck over the left field wall, giving the Trojans a 6-4 win.
“I kind of blacked out there for a second and just saw the ball fly, and thankfully, it went over,” Stubbs said. “I struck out really poorly earlier in the game on three straight sliders, so I knew they were going to come back to it, and I put a good swing on it.”
Stubbs was also involved in a key play in the seventh inning in which Clarke barehanded a dribbler back to the mound and fired home. Stubbs dug the low throw out of the dirt and applied the tag on the runner coming home to preserve the 2-2 tie. 
He redeemed himself after a passed ball in the ninth inning that could have nearly cost the Trojans the game.
“It stuck with me for a little bit, but when you come up to the plate, you’re on offense now,” Stubbs said. “You can’t let things that happened in the past dwell, and you’ve got to just clear the mind and take good swings.”
Beller attributed Saturday’s win partially to the Trojans’ energy.
“This team is so cohesive right now — the chemistry’s off the charts,” Beller said. “There was never a doubt in anyone’s mind that we were going to [win] this game.”
Stubbs echoed Beller’s words, adding that Saturday’s exciting win should propel the team moving forward.
“I have all the confidence in the world that this team’s going to use this game and really just accelerate from here,” Stubbs said. “There’s no looking back.”
USC faces UC Santa Barbara Tuesday night at Dedeaux Field before hosting Grand Canyon University for a weekend series. Friday’s game will begin at 6 p.m., first pitch on Saturday is 2 p.m. and Sunday’s finale starts at 1 p.m.

As men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield mused upon his team’s 67-62 defeat of Oregon State Saturday at Galen Center, he started talking about the makeup of a good team.
“Great teams have great leaders on them,” he said. “If you look at championship-level teams, there’s great leadership. There’s an unselfish spirit.” 
He wasn’t talking about USC.
“Certain guys,” Enfield continued, “need to be able to play with a more even temperament. Either you’re successful or you fail. Everybody fails. You need to grind it out and work hard and be a leader.” 
He was now talking about USC.
Ironically, this was Senior Day, a day when the program honors its veterans, its de facto leaders. Among them were forwards Bennie Boatwright and Shaqquan Aaron, a redshirt senior. Both have shown, in spurts, the ability to take control, the talent that made them both highly touted recruits out of high school. Boatwright is an NBA prospect. Aaron was a transfer from Louisville. Neither qualified as the “great leader” Enfield sought.
“We’ve had that [leader] the last three years,” Enfield said. “This year’s been a little bit of a struggle.”
That guy was Jordan McLaughlin, the point guard at the helm the previous four seasons who could be trusted as a calming, veteran presence. He graduated last year, along with backcourt-mate Elijah Stewart. Another starter, Chimezie Metu, departed for the NBA. That left this year’s team in the hands of the remaining upperclassmen like junior forward Nick Rakocevic.
Rakocevic, despite taking a big leap from his sophomore season, is too erratic to be counted on as a leader. That was what Enfield hinted at. The question that prompted the response, after all, was regarding Rakocevic’s performance — the Trojans’ second-leading scorer had by far his worst game of the season, fouling out in 10 minutes and recording just 4 points. He set the tone for his rough night with an ill-advised flagrant foul early in the first half, his second in the first three minutes.
Rakocevic’s foul trouble forced USC to play small. It changed the rotation. It affected the flow of the game. And USC, two nights after a resounding home win over Oregon, dropped a winnable game to Oregon State.  
“We need Nick,” Boatwright said. “When he’s not on the court, it changes the dynamic of our team.”
With Rakocevic effectively benched, the Trojans suffered their fourth loss in six games. They dropped to 8-7 in conference play, mired further in the pack of mediocrity that is the Pac-12. They ended their home schedule with a thud.
Moreover, the defeat brings up a question that has hung over USC’s heads all season long: Who is this program’s next leader? With Boatwright and Aaron leaving, next year’s team will have three seniors — assuming they all come back — Rakocevic, Jonah Mathews and Derryck Thornton. Mathews was a co-captain along with Boatwright this season. Thornton should return as the primary ball handler with the most college experience out of anyone on the roster.  
But if this season — in which an NCAA Tournament berth seems unlikely — served primarily as a bridge to get to next year, where the Trojans will bring in the nation’s third-best recruiting class, then they will need somebody to step up with a crop of talented but raw youngsters joining the team.
The Mobley brothers, both five-star recruits, will be rolling through USC the next two years. Onyeka Okongwu, a five-star big man from Chino Hills, is committed for next year. So are Max Agbonkpolo and Kyle Sturdivant, both four-stars. And Drake London, an athletic freak, will play both football and basketball next season.
There is no question the talent is there. USC should be ranked in the preseason top 25. But we have seen this tale before with this university’s prominent sports teams: Talent does not necessarily translate to wins.
If next season is “the year” for USC, then this season has not served as a very smooth bridge. What can make it smoother is if Enfield can find a leader to step up and be a coach on the floor, especially with the influx of eager freshmen arriving soon. It might be Mathews, if he is chosen as captain again. It might be Thornton, who started 20 games for Duke his freshman season, if he can become more consistent and less turnover-prone. It might even be Rakocevic, if he can be the dominant post presence he has developed into — every single game.
On Saturday, he wasn’t that guy. He fouled out with 1:16 left in regulation when USC was trailing by 5 points. It was a bad foul, an offensive foul that wasted a possession and helped Oregon State close out the win. After the call, Rakocevic immediately walked to the bench with his head down, the frustration evident as he slipped on a warm-up shirt over his jersey. He played 10 minutes out of 40, and recorded more fouls than points. That is not the stat line of a leader.
“Sometimes,” Enfield said, “certain people have trouble handling success.”
If success is to come for USC basketball, it will need to find a leader first.

Oscar Sunday is one of the biggest televised events of the  year. Yet, on Saturday, 24 hours before the world turned to the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood for the Academy Awards, Film Independent held its annual Spirit Awards inside a humongous tent at Santa Monica State Beach. A tradition 34 years in the making, the show has had a reputation for recognizing oft-overlooked filmmakers before the Academy Awards acknowledge the A-listers.
While they award achievement in similar categories as the Oscars, the Spirit Awards typically reward lower-budget, auteurist cinema. The result is a ceremony that recognizes and elevates the films normally left out. 
“The [independent] community is so much less mercenary,” said Bing Liu, who was nominated for the Spirit Awards’ Best Documentary category with his film “Minding the Gap,” told the Daily Trojan. “There are so many organizations like Film Independent who have helped us, who just want to support these films.” 
Film Independent earned praise for its recognition of female filmmakers. The directing category alone featured three female nominees out of five directors. 
“I’m very proud to say that 60 percent of our director nominees are women,” host Aubrey Plaza said in her opening monologue. “Don’t get too excited — in this case, 60 percent just means three women, but calling it 60 percent makes it sound way scarier to your uncles.”
Film Independent also gives out the Bonnie Award, a $50,000 grant to one visionary female director. This year, it was awarded to Debra Granik, who directed Best Feature nominee “Leave No Trace.” 
“This award is saying ‘Keep going, nose to the grindstone. We like what you’re doing, do more’ …  it’s a direct, mainline encouragement,” Granik said in her speech. 
As one of the final ceremonies of awards season, the Spirit Awards ceremony also serves as a send-off to many nominees who won’t make appearances at the Oscars. 
Best First Screenplay winner Bo Burnham made sure to thank his audience’s response to “Eighth Grade” in his final speech of awards season. 
“To the film community, I felt so embraced by you guys,” Burnham said. “I felt really, really, really intimidated entering the film community, and I just found it to be really gracious and accepting, so thank you so much.”
Best First Screenplay and Best First Feature are some of the categories wholly unique to the Spirit Awards — the latter was awarded to Boots Riley for his first film “Sorry to Bother You.” 
Riley, whose film debut deals with the intertwining of capitalism and race in modern society, spoke on how he had personally witnessed these issues in his own life growing up in Oakland. 
“Growing up, I got involved in movements that showed me that all the struggles that we’re talking about are related to material things and things that we can actually change,” Riley said in his speech. “We can have power react to us … basically through organizing on the job and through having movements that use withholding of labor as a tactic or a strategy for social change.”
Toward the end of the show, Glenn Close and Ethan Hawke won the Best Female and Male Lead awards, respectively. Both are recurring Spirit Awards personalities. 
“[Independent films] are not the kind of films studios are making anymore,” Close said in her acceptance speech. “It’s the kinds of stories that, I think, are incredibly important for us as human beings to try to figure out who we are, where we came from and where we’re going.”
One of the awards’ biggest winners was“If Beale Street Could Talk,” which came away with Spirit Awards for Best Supporting Female Actor (Regina King), Best Director (Barry Jenkins) and Best Feature. 
Barry Jenkins, who adapted the film from James Baldwin’s novel, said the medium of independent film allows audiences to witness stories from overlooked but relevant sources, including black authors.
“James Baldwin published his book 45 years ago, and many of the things he was talking about are still very relevant today,” Jenkins said in his acceptance speech for Best Director. “I think it shows that some of these issues with mass incarceration and systemic injustice still haven’t been addressed in those 45 years.” 
Although “If Beale Street Could Talk” was not considered for Best Picture at the Academy Awards,  Jenkins ended the night expressing his joy at receiving his first Spirit Award. 
“It’s dope because I’ll be honest, when I started making movies, I wanted to win these things.” Jenkins said in his speech. “I thought it was impossible to win [an Oscar]; somehow, through mixing of envelopes and whatnot we won. Also, you win Best Picture, and it doesn’t change the filmmaker that you are. I think being here, winning or losing, is confirmation and affirmation that we’re going to continue making things in the same way.” 
A decidedly more relaxed atmosphere than the Academy Awards, the Spirit Awards fittingly book ended awards season for many independent filmmakers and performers. As well, many of these artists praised Film Independent for creating an atmosphere of inclusivity and diversity inside their Santa Monica tent. In its 34th year, the Spirit Awards held onto its clear objective of acknowledging the stories many people do not (but need to) see.

For the last decade and a half, the music industry was shaped heavily by iTunes. Released in 2003, the platform helped the music business acclimate to changes in technology and shifted it toward digital downloading. For many years, digital downloading was extremely lucrative and accounted for the majority of record sales. Recently, however, that number has dwindled as streaming has emerged as the more favorable option.
As a result, many reports unfortunately point to iTunes potentially being ushered out as early as the end of next month. The process began with Apple Music’s debut in June 2015. Since then, Apple has been pushing its customer base toward streaming music rather than downloading it from iTunes. 
Now that sales of iPhones and other devices are declining, Apple is refocusing its brand on subscription services; this, of course, includes Apple Music as well as a Netflix-esque video service it will announce early next month. From there, attention may be turned away from downloading on iTunes and toward streaming.
This decision will have widespread effects across multiple industries. Ironically, Apple Music — and other streaming services — will be negatively affected due to increased pressure from labels and recording artists. Since streaming does not pay as much as digital sales, Apple’s decision to remove the feature option may give labels sufficient reason to pressure artists into augmenting its streaming royalties. Perhaps this will come in the form of removing songs and albums from streaming services until rates are increased, or maybe labels will push to pass legislation that establishes a price floor for streaming royalties. Regardless of the method, competitors like Spotify, Amazon and Google will also be forced to increase their rates to remain competitive. 
Getting rid of iTunes will (and should) also make the “windowing” method for new music releases more popular as long as labels are smart about it. “Windowing” is when a recording artist withholds new material from streaming services for a period of time. For example, Taylor Swift kept her 2017 album “reputation” from Spotify during its first week of release. Other artists, like Kanye West and Beyoncé, have done the same thing in the past. 
This is an easy way to potentially increase sales, but only if artists are strategic. The smart thing to do would be to keep the streaming release date secretive. Beyoncé’s self-titled, fifth studio album was kept away from all streaming services for an entire year after its release. Many fans did not know when it would appear on Apple Music and Spotify, or if it ever would, which likely pushed them to purchase it outright. Similarly, her sixth studio album “Lemonade” has yet to appear on any streaming service almost three years after its release, so the majority of its sales have been downloads. Of course, this technique can alienate a large number of fans and increase music piracy, but it definitely has the potential to increase the number of pure music sales without the need for platforms like iTunes. 
Interestingly, iTunes’ death may actually aid music distribution in some ways. There is seemingly a growing sense of music nostalgia among millennials, which means old-school music paraphernalia — like CDs and vinyl records — are making a strong comeback. 
The industry needs to leverage this. It is conceivable that a label or recording artist could set up their own way to facilitate music downloads, such as a secure Dropbox, and attach a digital download file to every purchase of a CD or vinyl LP. In this case, fans can be satisfied with having a physical copy for decorative purposes as well as a digital copy that will actually be used for consumption. Either way, labels are happy with being paid more than they would if the album were streamed.
Alternatively, artists could also attach digital downloads to every purchase of merchandise (T-shirts, buttons, pens, shot glasses). Essentially, they can give fans the option to digitally download music directly from their websites. 
In any case, the era of digital downloading is mostly over, and its decline is not something that the recording industry will be able to halt. Apple’s eventual termination of iTunes is only going to add insult to injury, but hopefully the music business will be clever enough to implement solutions to offset the effects.

President Donald Trump wants to take a lot of things away from Californians — from threatening to suspend natural disaster aid to intimidating immigrants and sanctuary state policies, the current administration continues to undermine the best parts of the Golden State. Last week, he even asked for $3.5 billion back from California. Luckily, Gov. Gavin Newsom has already put his foot down. 
“This is California’s money, and we are going to fight for it,” Newsom wrote in a statement, following a Twitter skirmish with the president.
This money was a portion of funds federally allocated for California’s high-speed rail project, voted for in 2008 and partially retracted by Newsom in his 2019 State of the State address. Newsom made the right choice in calling to scale back the project, because it isn’t fiscally feasible for California to execute the entirety of former Gov. Jerry Brown’s train plan. He also made the right choice in battling Trump for money that rightfully belongs to California’s infrastructure development, but he should have still affirmed the vision of this project. He should have reminded Californians of all that could be accomplished with high-speed rail — strengthened transportation infrastructure, environmental protection and opportunities for higher efficiency, production and state unity.
I’m a Bay Area native attending college in Los Angeles. My future airplane ticket savings and my hopes for the future of transit rode on this train. While options like FlixBus, Megabus or Amtrak are all more environmentally friendly than making the solo drive in my minivan, this proposed high-speed rail system promised to cut the trip from a seven-hour drive to less than half that. It would save me a tank of gas and save the environment from almost 100 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. 
California needs a cross-state train.  California’s image as a highway state is detrimental to the state’s environmental health and our future in transit technology and development. Decreasing the number of single passenger vehicles and commercial trucks on the road would reduce emissions and off-ramp congestion when driving into urban areas. High-speed rail would stimulate development and create housing in areas previously inaccessible.
Industries like tourism might even benefit from this high-speed train — the more convenient travel is, the more likely it is that people will travel. Travel between two of California’s largest metropolitan areas, San Francisco and Los Angeles, would increase. The underappreciated Central Valley would get more traffic (though not by car). Fresno will be known for more than raisins. Bakersfield will be more than just California’s Texas. Sacramento will lose the status of “town you escape from, not live in,” as illustrated in the 2017 film “Lady Bird,” and people might even remember it’s California’s capital city. 
Last year, the American Lung Association reported that eight of the 10 most polluted areas in the U.S. are in California. Most of them are located in the Central Valley, the area that ironically caused a spike in the high-speed rail’s projected price. The project’s initial cost was proposed to be secured through only $9 billion in bonds, and it now stands at a projected cost of $77 billion. The higher price tag comes from the cost of purchasing so much land in the Central Valley, one of the regions that would most benefit from this train. Geographical challenges not recognized in the original plan also started emerging during construction, raising costs even further.
Admittedly, $77 billion is a lot of money. This money could be better allocated to improving local transit, like expanding the Bay Area Rapid Transit service area or converting southern California’s MetroLink to entirely electric-powered trains. These developments would set up infrastructure for more affordable and sustainable interstate transit in the future.
With Trump’s money-grubbing and constant complications, California can’t afford this project, especially now that its projected completion date has been extended. But that doesn’t mean California shouldn’t aspire to a train system that rivals countries with smaller economies -— that managed to build their own rail systems with a proportionally similar service area to California’s. It’s expensive, but not impossible — if the U.S. can build a transcontinental railroad, California should be capable of laying about 500 miles of track.
All in all, it was a poor move on Newsom’s part. He spoke vaguely in his State of the State address about the train — initially, most outlets interpreted his statement as a surrender of the plan entirely. The Associated Press sent out a single line alert: “California Gov. Gavin Newsom abandoning plan for high-speed train from Los Angeles to San Francisco, says too costly,” updating later with Newsom’s clarification — he wants to scale back the project, not end it completely. 
Newsom is trying to appease the highest number of people through his compromise, but in failing to support his predecessors’ project — or even rejecting and ending it entirely — he has sent a mixed message to Californians, furthering our doubt in the possibility of high-speed rail. Whether or not the high-speed rail becomes a reality in the projected time frame, its benefits are important to keep in mind — because California needs better infrastructure, transit planning and environmental consciousness.

At the beginning of this month, USC came under fire for an unusual theft incident that occurred nearly a decade ago. The Los Angeles Times published an article detailing the 2012 theft of two lamps and a chair designed by world-renowned architects Frank Lloyd Wright and Rudolph Schindler; the items were taken from a USC storage facility. Samuel and Harriet Freeman displayed these artifacts in their house, also designed by Wright, and when they died, the Freemans donated the artifacts and house to the University. However, USC has since neglected these properties with no regard for their historical significance — a shortcoming that USC must address as an academic institution.
Since the story broke, the University has made no moves to recover any of the stolen items. USC should have taken steps to not only find these artifacts, but also ensure that the artifacts were restored and put on display to the public. Beyond these fixes, USC must renovate the run-down Freeman house and make it accessible to both the public and USC students who wish to visit this architectural treasure for its architectural and historical importance.
Following the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which severely damaged the Freeman House, the University placed most of the furniture and other pieces from the house in a storage facility. It would seem that many of these pieces would be of interest to the public, as they were designed by two prominent architects. USC architecture and design students could also learn from these artifacts. But instead these pieces were locked away in a storage unit.
While the University made an effort to preserve the artifacts from the house, it wasted that effort by closing the house to the public and keeping its renovations under wraps. USC could reopen the house as a museum with free admission or even charge a fee to support upkeep of the house and its furniture. Even though the University says it is making steps to ensure that the Freeman House will have a “promising future,” it remains astonishing that officials have not made such an effort years ago.
The theft is demonstrative of the University’s mismanagement of historical artifacts. Even the officials in charge of the facility can’t seem to get their story straight: One associate architectural professor said that there was only one key to the room where the lamps and chair were kept, while the University said it was “unlikely” that there was only one key. The theft went unreported for seven years, exemplifying USC’s failure to be accountable for its own property. The University has promised that the house and its remaining pieces will be preserved, but it should also take direct responsibility to restore the space and make better use of it. This way, the general public could experience the famous house the way its architects intended, and they could use the revenue from this venture into preserving other architectural artifacts of value and the house itself. 
One example USC should look at is how Stanford University currently manages the Hanna House, also designed by Wright, and offers tours to the public. In the late 1900s, the house also sustained earthquake damage.
However, Stanford took steps to restore the house to its former glory, and it has been open to the public since 1999. USC should follow Stanford’s steps and ensure that this architectural treasure has a future. 
The University must take these steps to ensure the future of the Freeman House and work hard to restore and preserve the other architectural artifacts in its possession. Artifacts of historical significance cannot be appreciated if they are in a storage unit, or stolen.

Twenty-five representatives from universities across Southern California brainstormed student government strategies at a conference meant to foster dialogue among student leaders Sunday. The Shared Governance Symposium invited leaders from USC, UCLA, Occidental College and Pitzer College to discuss challenges and collaborate on solutions found on each campus. 
Undergraduate Student Government Associate Director of Marketing Truman Fritz, a sophomore majoring in business administration with an emphasis in cinematic arts, organized the symposium and welcomed the delegates to campus. He said the symposium would give student leaders the opportunity to act as “consultants” for one another. 
“[We wanted] to talk about how we work with administrators to effectively enact our agendas … and represent at large,” Fritz said. “Then that conversation … started to spiral into something that I think is a lot bigger, which is building a regional coalition of educational institutions in Southern California to discuss how to do student government, how to make sure you are prioritizing the right needs, how you are representing students at large, how you are making an impact in your community.” 
USG president-elect Trenton Stone and Occidental student body president Jacques Lesure helped organize the event, which was held at USC Village.  
“I wanted to connect with colleges from across the Southern California region … around best practices of elevating student voices at the institution,” Lesure said. 
Occidental College created the SGS conference in Fall 2018 and hosted 11 delegates from the region. This semester, USC is hosting the conference, which has expanded to 25 delegates. 
After introducing the event, student leaders initiated a open forum-style conversation to share some of the challenges of being in a position of leadership at their respective universities. Several attendees spoke about managing student apathy and low levels of engagement.
USG vice president-elect Mahin Tahsin said the apathy stems from students who feel like they don’t need to engage with campus issues because they are already preoccupied with their own studies and communities. 
Erin Cooney, co-director of the USC Queer and Allied Student Association, said it is difficult to motivate students to work with an administration that is unwilling to change. 
“We are overworked and also running up against institutions that are intentionally rigid,” Cooney said. 
Shivani Kavuluru, president of Pitzer College’s Student Senate, suggested that stronger trust and widespread involvement in student government could convince students to participate and engage with their respective universities.
“For the student body to believe we represent them, I think we also have an obligation to convince them that we represent them,” Kavuluru said. 
Representatives from the four schools also discussed the need for student governments to better represent the diverse student bodies at their respective universities. 
QuASA co-director Varsha Sivaram said that this was a complicated situation for USG because it identifies as a nonpartisan body.
“I’m definitely on the same sentiment of having diversity of thought and opinion,” Sivaram said. “But at the same time sometimes I feel like that these are used as code … to have to listen to people invalidate an identity.” 
The challenges of representation prompted the student leaders to discuss ways to promote diversity of both identity and thought, even when they may conflict. 
At the end of the event, attendees expressed interest in having another symposium in the coming months and said they hope to increase attendance.
“The administration wants you to think that you have no say, they want you to think that you can’t do anything,” said Ava Ciosek, Occidental College’s Intercultural Affairs Liaison. “They want to churn students out … Like why are we all in this room? … Because we feel it’s our [duty] … to change them.” 
A previous version of this article contained an error. Eva [sic] Ciosek is not Occidental College’s student body President — it is Jacques Lesure, as mentioned earlier in the article. Ava Ciosek is Intercultural Affairs Liaison on the Diversity and Equity Board. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

When Design@USC student Tawny Tran decided to discuss Asian American representation in media for an online class assignment, the comment she got from her professor wasn’t one she expected. 
“[He said] people don’t watch films because there are Hispanic people, black people or women in it,” Tran said. “He kind of just shut off and completely dismissed any kind of topic in regards to race or gender, and it made me very uncomfortable that it wasn’t even open to my perspective on it at all.” 
Tran tried to report the professor to the director of her program but was told nothing could be done. 
With the help of fellow graduate classmates Angela Newman and Deon Reid she decided to take matters into her own hands by forming the Multicultural Innovators Association, a student-run club within the Design@USC program. Tran said MIA aims to start conversations about microaggressions and the challenges students of color face at USC.
Design@USC, also known as the Masters in Integrated Design, Business and Technology, is a program in the Iovine and Young Academy. According to Iovine and Young’s faculty page, its faculty is composed primarily of white men. There are only two women and three people of color out of 20 instructors listed on the page. According to Tran, MIA launched in January as a diversity and inclusion initiative — one of the first in Iovine and Young.
Tran is the club’s vice president and technology chair. 
“Our [Design@USC] program is mostly online,” Tran said. “And to be experiencing unconscious bias and microaggression over a computer [in a classroom setting] was kind of crazy for [me and my friends] — that’s when we started meeting up to discuss what to do about it.” 
According to Newman, president and business chair of the organization, planning for MIA began in May 2018.
“We started with texting and just conversations in class,” said Newman, a graduate student in the Design@USC program. “Then we started to meet up … and started brainstorming on the board and starting throwing up all the things that we’re bothered by, or things that we wanted to change, or things that we don’t have …  as minority students.” 
Newman, Tran and Reid created a document with thoughts and concerns about the disadvantages that they had faced as students of color and emailed it to Iovine and Young Academy Dean Erica Muhl. 
They then met with Muhl, department heads and advisors to have a conversation about diversity and inclusion in the Academy. 
“I really appreciated that the dean did that,” Newman said. “[She] took the time to say ‘Hey, I was reading your email, let’s sit down and have a talk about this’ … she could have said nothing.” 
But by the end of the meeting, Newman said no official plan had been made, so they decided to start a club. 
During a Design@USC lab program, they proposed their idea to their peers and professor Jay Clewis.
“It was an actual project assignment that we were getting graded on,” Newman said. “We had to do surveys, we had to do interviews. We had to make sure that [there was] sound evidence to prove that [MIA] was something that [students at Design@USC] need and wanted.” 
According to MIA’s website, the club’s purpose is to protect the educational rights and needs of Design@USC students of color. Meetings take place on the first Monday of every month on Zoom, a video conferencing app that is also used in the Academy’s online courses. Design@USC has students from around the world, including Chicago and Canada. According to Newman, MIA is meant to be inclusive of those students who do not have the opportunity to participate in events that take place on campus. 
Katia Valenzuela, a graduate student in the Design@USC program and MIA’s graphic design chair, said the online aspect of the club allowed her to build relationships with her peers.
“When you think of the idea of being with people online, it sounds a little bit isolating,” Valenzuela said. “You [think that if] you’re alone in a room and you’re far away from everyone, [you can’t] interact with anyone. In actuality, [MIA] does a really good job [of creating social connections] … It’s more comforting than it is isolating.”
Design@USC is an 18-month program, and most members of MIA’s executive board are set to graduate in May, but Newman said the organization was formed with future students in mind.
“I knew that creating this wasn’t really about me, I know that I’m going to [be] graduating soon, so I’m not going to be able to see what [MIA] will be like in two years or even a year,” Newman said. “[MIA] is not about what am I getting, its about what can I help provide for others. ”

A false report of an active shooter on campus led officials from the Department of Public Safety and Los Angeles Police Department to arrive at Bovard Auditorium, the School of Cinematic Arts and Parkside Restaurant Sunday afternoon. The incident was prompted by miscommunication to the LAPD. 
DPS confirmed all areas have been cleared. 
The error occurred following an accident involving an employee at the dining hall.
“The employee at Parkside had a seizure, fell, hit his head, was bleeding and somehow from that — as people were told to move away and call for help — that evolved into a shots fired call,” DPS Captain Edgar Palmer said. 
According to Palmer, a student ran onto Exposition Boulevard to inform an officer in the LAPD Transit Services Division of an alleged shooter on campus. The officer put out a call with the location of 3551 University Ave., which officers misinterpreted as Trousdale Parkway, leading them to report to Bovard Auditorium. No incident occurred at Bovard.
The only report received from Parkside was regarding the dining hall employee’s injury. The employee is now receiving medical attention after suffering a laceration due to his fall, Palmer said.
Emma Reynolds, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, was sitting outside the dining hall when she heard alerts of an active shooter.  
“I heard yelling coming from inside the dining hall, and I wasn’t really sure what was happening,” Reynolds said. “I looked out to see what was going on, and the women employees were coming out and one of them ran past me … An ambulance pulled out, then two policemen with rifles came … yelling at us to get out of the area.”
Reynolds said the miscommunication surrounding the false report made her feel uneasy. 
“In the case there was a real shooter at Parkside, it is a little terrifying that they arrived at the wrong location,” Reynolds said. “They came quickly but people could have gotten hurt by then. There was so much miscommunication in the whole situation and that’s how it all got blown out of proportion.” 
LAPD did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
