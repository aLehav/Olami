Arthur John “Jack” Langguth, professor emeritus at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, died on Monday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 81.

Langguth died of respiratory failure, his close friends told the New York Times.
After growing up an only child in Minneapolis, Langguth went on to graduate from Harvard College in 1955. As a journalist, Langguth reported on the front lines during a turbulent period. He covered John F. Kennedy’s 1960 presidential campaign for Look magazine before joining the New York Times. During the Vietnam War, he served as a Southeast Asia correspondent for the newspaper in 1964 and the Saigon bureau chief in 1965.
Langguth authored more than a dozen books, including Our Vietnam: The War 1954-1975 and Patriots: The Men Who Started the American Revolution. His latest book, After Lincoln: How the North Won the Civil War and Lost the Peace, about the Reconstruction period in America, will be released by Simon & Schuster in September.
Former students and colleagues shared their memories of Langguth on social media.
Annenberg professor Joe Saltzman, who first met Langguth in 1962 at the Valley Times Today in Los Angeles, reflected on his friendship with Langguth in a series of posts on Facebook and in an article on the Annenberg website.
“Jack was the kindest man I know when it came to anyone who asked his help,” Saltzman wrote. “He was mentor to dozens of young writers — looking over their work, making razor-sharp suggestions for improvement, helping them get a publisher or an agent. And he was as loyal a friend as anyone could ever have.”
A former student, Elson Trinidad, now a writer for KCET.org, took to Twitter to voice his sadness.
“The  greatest  thing Dr. Jack Langguth taught me at @USCAnnenberg was confidence in my own writing. Thanks & RIP, sir,” Trinidad wrote.
Langguth left no surviving family members.

Last week, the USC Shoah Foundation launched the full version of its educational website IWitness after two years of beta testing. Focused primarily on interacting with students in middle and high school, the website is currently being operated in 58 nations around the world as well as in all 50 U.S. states.
IWitness was launched in beta in January 2012 at the United Nations. That same year, the American Association of School Librarians designated IWitness as one of the Top 25 Websites for Teaching and Learning.
Soon after its inception in 2012, the developing team worked closely with the beta testers, which included educators and students from different parts of the world. Improvements include at least three additional languages to broaden global access to the site. After analyzing the user feedback, the team made video additions to the template and refined the structure of the site.
“Two and a half years later, the website is robust and full of content,” said IWitness manager Jenna Leventhal.
The full-service educational website focuses primarily on interacting with  middle and high school students and contains more than 1,300 audio-visual Holocaust and other genocide testimonials from the Shoah Foundation’s Visual History Archives. Each video contains the life story of an individual with a particular focus on the persecution they suffered.
The Shoah Foundation has partnered with the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the Rossier School of Education to introduce IWitness as a guide for future educators to teach about events such as the Holocaust, and to emphasize the importance of multimedia in a 21st century classroom. Currently, IWitness contains not only Holocaust testimonials but also interviews with people who lived through the Rwandan Genocide of 1994 and the Nanjing Massacre during World War II.
Leventhal said that the primary vision of the program has been to inspire empathy in young adults. In addition, the innovative software of the program allows both educators and students to create personalized interfaces, which are not limited to video testimonials and custom lesson plans.
“It allows students to reflect on what they experience through the program and relate it to similar but more current world affairs,” Leventhal said.
The website’s capabilities are broad and designed to be user-friendly. The participating teachers are prompted to activate an account and add their students to a roster, which will record the students’ activities. Educators are then able to create tasks for their students that include customized lessons and video projects. The groups’ information and activities are kept private, but some educators have been so impressed with the results of implementing IWitness in their curriculums that they would like to share their success publicly.
“Another very important quality of this program is that it teaches its user how to ethically construct a testimonial of such delicate quality,” said Josh Grossberg, public communications manager for the Shoah Foundation.
Educators who choose to add the program to their curriculum can register at no cost and begin working with the program after a one-step registration process. The program includes all the content, training and tools necessary to efficiently operate the website.
I think it is essential to the goal of promoting and inspiring empathy that the victims of the Nakba to be included in the IWitness testimonies, especially since many of them are now quite elderly.

Professor Daniel Mazmanian of the USC Price School of Public Policy has been named the new academic director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy.
Bipartisan · Left to right, Sen. Michael Bennet, Sen. John McCain and ABC News Radio correspondent Ann Compton speak on campus in April 2013. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
In his 14-year career at USC, Mazmanian served as dean of the Price School and the founding director of the USC Bedrosian Center on Governance and the Public Enterprise. His areas of expertise include environmental policy and climate change.
Mazmanian replaces Nancy Staudt, previously a law professor and vice dean at the Gould School of Law. As director, Mazmanian hopes to highlight environmental policy issues.
“We will be emphasizing the political, economic and cultural changes that are going to be required not just in California, but the nation and the rest of the world in both mitigating and adapting to climate change,” Mazmanian told USC News.
Mazmanian has partnered with the institute and former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in the past through his research as director of new initiatives for Price’s Center for Sustainable Cities, according to Bonnie Reiss, global director of the Schwarzenegger Institute.
Schwarzenegger, who chairs the institute and serves as the Governor Downey Professor of State and Global Policy at USC, said he was looking forward to new environmental policies proposed by the institute.
“I am so pleased to have Dan Mazmanian join my institute as our academic director,” Schwarzenegger told USC News. “[Mazmanian] is a perfect choice for so many reasons, especially with his expertise in environment, energy and climate change, which is an important focus of our institute.”
Reiss said she believes that Mazmanian has made significant contributions to the Institute through his past position as dean of the Price School.
“The fact that he has been a dean and been at USC so long, and is so passionate about his work and his students will allow us to access all of the brilliant faculty and people at USC,” she said.
Students say they look forward to increased research opportunities in the social sciences as the Schwarzenegger Institute continues its development.
“I think it’s so amazing that USC has all these research opportunities,” said Caitlin Greenho, a freshman majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “It makes us stand out as a university and gives students an unrivaled advantage not only to learn from others in partnership with the Schwarzenegger Institute, but to make their own discoveries under the leadership of faculty like Professor Mazmanian.”
Mazmanian said that students have the opportunity to get involved with the institute through events and personal interaction with its leadership.
“One way is by attending as many Schwarzenegger Institute events as possible, introducing oneself, and sharing interests with others present, in particular, Bonnie Reiss the global director of the institute and me,” Mazmanian said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “A second is to stay alert to email announcements that are routinely distributed, by Schwarzenegger Institute and most others, when assistance is needed on projects, and apply.”

At Tuesday night’s USG meeting, USG Vice President Rini Sampath announced that an online guide for USC students who are admitted for the spring semester will be available within a week. The guide, which will be posted on USG’s website, will give spring admits information on what to expect during their freshman year.
“It’s an opportunity for spring-admitted students to come here to be successful and feel like they’ll have a great time,” Sampath said.
Currently, official information for incoming spring admits is limited to frequently asked questions pages on USC’s website. Sampath hopes that the new guide will expand on this page and provide more information.
“This will be a comprehensive guide,” Sampath said. “It will take the information from the FAQ page and really flesh it out.”
The new guide will cover a variety of topics, including housing, registering for classes and food on campus.
Inspiration for the page came from Winston Lee, a sophomore majoring in computer science and computer engineering who created a Google Document for students who were admitted in the spring of 2014. A spring 2014 admit himself as well as a current USG senate aid, Lee created the page to help others facing similar challenges.
“Basically I wanted something I didn’t have as a student, which was a document that compiled the different information I gathered through my research,” Lee said.
Before enrolling at USC, Lee lived near campus and took classes at Los Angeles Community College. He struggled to find information about which of his credits would transfer and what other classes he should take.
“[The information] is definitely out there, it’s just hidden on different sites and different pages,” Lee said.
USG’s new page will expand on Lee’s design and will feature graphic design and testimonials from former spring admits
“We’re taking what Winston [Lee] created and making it more accessible, and more aesthetically pleasing,” Sampath said.
Sampath and Lee met at USC while participating in student government. Their decision to collaborate grew from both being spring admits themselves.
“We bonded over the spring admission experience,” Lee said.
In her experience, Sampath found that the Facebook page for spring admits was filled with questions.
“The Facebook page had a lot of questions, like ‘what do I do about housing?’” Sampath said.
Though it is specifically designed for spring admits, Sampath and Lee hope that the new page will answer questions that are relevant for all students.
“The final product should be something that everyone at our university be able to utilize,” Sampath said.

USC’s women’s soccer team picked up two early-season honors this week, as junior midfielder Reilly Parker and senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley won Pac-12 Offensive Player and Goalkeeper of the Week, respectively. It is the first Pac-12 Player of the Week award for both of these Women of Troy.
No score zone · Senior goalkeeper and co-captain Caroline Stanley only allowed two goals in two games this weekend at the Notre Dame Adidas Invitational. She has only allowed three goals in four games this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Parker transferred to USC from national powerhouse North Carolina this season and has made an immediate impact. While playing left defensive back, she has become a staple of the starting 11 and an essential part of the squad’s defensive core under first-year head coach Keidane McAlpine. In this weekend’s games, however, her contribution came in the form of offensive firepower.
Parker racked up four shots over the weekend at the Notre Dame Adidas Invitational and netted two goals in as many games to lead the Women of Troy to a 3-1 victory over Iowa State and a 2-1 stunner against No. 9 Notre Dame. Parker’s winner in the 72nd minute against Notre Dame completed the comeback against the Irish, and her defensive work was enough to hold both of the weekend’s opposition to just one goal in each match.
This season, Parker has placed five shots on goal and made two, the highest shooting percentage on the team (.400). The Danville, California native appears very capable of filling the void left by last year’s leading scorer, Elizabeth Eddy, who was drafted by the National Women’s Soccer League’s Sky Blue FC in January.
Though Parker has impressed on defense at times this season, nobody is more crucial to USC’s defensive effort than Stanley.
Though she had a shaky start to the weekend, allowing an Iowa State goal in the third minute of the game, the Kansas City, Missouri native held down the fort for the rest of the game.
Stanley only allowed two goals past her net all weekend, while gathering seven saves. Despite not reaching double-digit numbers in saves, Stanley was constantly tested, especially during the Notre Dame match where she weathered a total of 18 shots from the Fighting Irish.
A penalty kick save in the 74th minute was by far the most crucial of all her efforts when she stopped Irish forward Glory Williams’ shot from the mark and stifled all of Notre Dame’s following attempts to tie the game up.  Her scoreline-preserving save proved to be the pinnacle of the team’s impressive games this past week and has now earned her a well-deserved Pac-12 Goalkeeper of the Week award.
The Women of Troy emerge from a successful weekend — both on and off the pitch — undefeated, and looking poised to continue their outstanding play. They will have their first opportunity to do so this Friday during their home opener against the undefeated UC Riverside Lady Highlanders at 4 p.m. at USC’s McAlister Field.

Plenty of things could have gone wrong for USC on Saturday against Fresno State. I wasn’t nervous, but I certainly had memories of last year’s Washington State game fresh in my mind as I walked into the Coliseum for another home opener.
Very little did go wrong.
Evident by their performance and the 52-13 final score, the Trojans did not underestimate the Bulldogs like they did the Cougars last season, despite a week filled with off-the-field distractions. The Trojans took care of business, sending a large portion of the dehydrated student section confidently to the exits at halftime with a 31-7 lead. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler didn’t call it a day until the fourth quarter — when redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne took over under center — but there was very little doubt that the Trojans came to play after Kessler led the Trojans on a 17-play, 90-yard touchdown drive that took just over six minutes off the clock to start the game and the season.
It’s way too early to offer any real assessment of the team. As college football’s resident cranky grandpa Lou Holtz said oh-so-eloquently over the weekend, per Grantland’s Holly Anderson, predicting the path of a team after one game is like predicting the career path of an infant. It’s the kind of critical analysis that must have led Notre Dame to a national championship in 1988.
“Is it gonna be a doctor? I don’t know; it’s a baby.”
The analogy rings true for USC. Though the team collectively did some serious growing up this past week of practice and certainly looked mature beyond its years, things are only going to get harder.
With all due respect to Fresno State, this was a team USC beat last year in the Las Vegas Bowl 45-20 — and that was while the Bulldogs still had star quarterback Derek Carr, who was just named the starter as a rookie for the Oakland Raiders. Fresno State may have won the Mountain West Conference last year, but the Mountain West has nothing on the Pac-12.
Additionally, while the team handled both of the major off-field distractions brilliantly, and that level of mental fortitude is consistent with what we saw in last year’s coaching carousel, more distractions are bound to pop up.
Players said all the right things about the Josh Shaw and Anthony Brown incidents to the media leading up to the game, then let their play do the real talking on Saturday.
But if last year is any indication, those two incidents are far from the only bumps in the road USC will hit this year. In fact, those two incidents might not entirely be in the rearview mirror.
Players said after the game that it’s time to stop talking about Shaw and Brown; it’s time to move on. Though Brown likely will not come up again the rest of the year — and his incident would have fit more with Sports Illustrated’s “Signs of the Apocalypse” than national headlines if it happened independent of Shaw’s — Shaw’s certainly was a very big deal and is far from resolved.
We know at this point that his drowning rescue mission was a complete fabrication, but we still don’t know what actually happened or what led to him spraining both of his ankles. Maybe the most telling piece of information we do know is that he hired defense attorney Donald Etra, who has twice been hired by Snoop Dogg when the rapper faced felony charges. As I wrote earlier this year, however, we don’t know enough to offer a judgment until a jury of Shaw’s peers does so, and there’s a chance Shaw is completely innocent of any criminal activity.
The point is that Shaw’s incident will likely reappear over the course of the year. He might be indicted for a felony before the season ends; he might be reinstated to the team before the season ends. Neither could happen or both could happen.
It would not be unheard of for the team to avoid more injuries and win the other 11 games on its regular season schedule. Their highest-ranked opponent, UCLA, looked very vulnerable against an unranked Virginia team. But there will likely be more players who get hurt, other players who underperform and times when the Trojans find themselves trailing at halftime and need someone to step up. That will be the true test of USC’s character, and it might come this weekend in Palo Alto. USC certainly met the challenge of Stanford last year, though the team didn’t have a single comeback from a halftime deficit in 2013.
All signs, however, have been definitively positive through week one. Kessler looked very poised as the undisputed leader going into the season and avoided any interceptions.
A wide variety of true freshman appearing in their first-ever college football game made huge impacts, including Adoree’ Jackson, JuJu Smith and Bryce Dixon. Some Facebook albums from the first tailgate likened football season to the most wonderful time of the year, and this batch of new first-year players feels a lot like a Christmas present in late August. Perhaps most importantly, head coach Steve Sarkisian and his staff aced their first game plan, and his players seem to have total confidence in him.
It really is the most wonderful time of year, finally being back at school, seeing everyone again and coming together over the joy of another season of USC football.
It’s going to be an awesome year.

USC cruised to its first victory of the year on Saturday, downing the Fresno State Bulldogs by a 52-13 score.
This week the Trojans are back on the practice field preparing for a worthy opponent in the No. 13 Stanford Cardinal.
First Game Jitters
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler and USC’s crop of true freshmen stole the show on Saturday. Freshman wide receiver-safety John “JuJu” Smith racked up 123 receiving yards in his debut. Freshman wide receiver-cornerback Adoree’ Jackson and freshman tight end Bryce Dixon both notched their first touchdowns as Trojans. Meanwhile, offensive linemen Toa Lobendahn and Damien Mama became the first true freshman duo to start USC’s opener in recorded history.

“It was really cool to see not only those guys get in and actually play but also make an impact,” Kessler said following Tuesday’s practice. “You know some of those guys JuJu, Adoree’, some of the O-linemen, they made a significant impact in the game and they really helped us win. It was really cool to see coming from some guys that it was their first college game.”
Redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne had a special swagger in his step after taking his first-ever game reps as a Trojan on Saturday in USC’s blowout win.
“For any player it’s more of a mental barrier you kind of hurdle,” Browne said. “You get the first time jitters out, but it was awesome to get out there, throw a couple passes [and] have some success.”
Toe jam
Kessler underwent a procedure on his toe on Tuesday morning and missed practice.
“He had to deal with his toe that had been bothering him throughout the ballgame,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “We felt like we wanted to take care of it sooner rather than later … We expect him to be full-go tomorrow and be ready to go for the game.”
The Bakersfield, California native, who was named Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week following his career performance, will be crucial in Saturday’s matchup against the Cardinal, and he promises he will be ready.
“I’m 100 percent,” Kessler said. “I’m fine.”
Kessler passed for a career-high 394 yards on Saturday and a career-tying four touchdowns. He also rushed for one touchdown.
Kessler assured the media that he will be able to practice again all week. When asked if he was surprised that Kessler didn’t practice, Browne simply said, “Cody’s deal is Cody’s deal.”
Junior defensive end Leonard Williams rolled an ankle in practice and Mama looked like he hurt his knee, but Sarkisian called it more of a scare than an injury.
Pac-12 Rivals
The Trojans will open Pac-12 play this Saturday when they take on the 13th-ranked Cardinal. USC has not won a game at Stanford since 2008; however, the Trojans beat the Cardinal last year at the Coliseum. This will be Kessler’s first game against the Cardinal away from home.
“I haven’t played there before so I’m excited,” Kessler said. “It’ll be a fun game, real competitive.”
In preparation for Saturday’s game, Kessler reflected on the matchup as he remembered it from last year.
“They were tough,” Kessler said. “They were really tough. Their front seven was really physical.”
Kessler threw for 288 yards and one touchdown in last year’s 20-17 upset over Stanford.
While Sarkisian was coaching at Washington, he sparked up a bit of a rivalry of his own with Stanford and head coach David Shaw by accusing the Cardinal of faking injuries.
“Honestly, David [Shaw] and I are both highly competitive people,” Sarkisian said. “We both want to win; we both want our teams to do well … We’re gonna battle and compete this week and all day Saturday to try to win the game.”
 
Incredible game one.  But just to repeat what you have already learned (!), which is way too parental:  Defense, don’t charge in so fast you miss that Stanford Q-back and look out for the draw.  Ah hates the draw….

The Trojans ushered in the Steve Sarkisian era on Saturday afternoon following a chaotic week in Troy. USC’s 15th-ranked football team silenced all the whispers about senior cornerback Josh Shaw’s suspension and senior running back Anthony Brown’s departure by charging to a 52-13 victory over the Fresno State Bulldogs.
Breakout performance · Freshman wide receiver-safety John “JuJu” Smith eclipsed 100 receiving yards in just the first half of the game against Fresno State. The Long Beach Poly product finished with 123 yards. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The events of the past week proved to be no distraction to the Trojans on the field, who put up their highest yard total (701) since 2005 in Sarkisian’s first game as USC’s head coach. The Trojans achieved those 701 yards on 105 total plays, which broke the previous Pac-12 record.
The Trojans looked a bit shaky out of the gates, as true freshman wide receiver JuJu Smith committed a holding penalty on the opening kickoff and redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler nearly threw a pick-six to Fresno State safety Derron Smith on the first play from scrimmage. But from then on, Kessler and Smith were two of USC’s most dynamic players.
Kessler proved to have mastered Sarkisian’s new up-tempo offense, putting up a career-high 394 yards and tying career-highs with 37 attempts, 25 completions and four touchdown passes. The Bakersfield, California native got the Trojans’ scoring storm started with a one-yard touchdown run on the first drive of the game.
Though Kessler’s aerial abilities might have surprised some USC fans, Sarkisian insisted that Kessler has always had it in him.
“The way [Kessler] throws and his athleticism in short areas is better than a lot of people,” Sarkisian said. “He has the ability to buy time and make plays down the field and throw an excellent ball.”
Kessler looked in sync with all of his targets, old and new. He spread the ball out between nine different receivers, including true freshman tight end Bryce Dixon and true freshmen wide receivers Smith and Adoree’ Jackson.
Sarkisian lauded the abilities of the group of freshmen.
“I’m not surprised, quite honestly, that they were able to go in and play,” Sarkisian said. “We’ve challenged them every single day and thrown them in with the ones, whether it’s JuJu or Adoree’ or Bryce Dixon or the young O-linemen that were in there, all those guys stepped in and played well.”
Freshman Ajene Harris was slated to start at wide receiver, but Smith started in his place, and it made a huge difference for the Trojans. Smith, who also wreaked havoc on the defensive side of the ball, eclipsed 100 receiving yards early in the second quarter. Smith achieved that mark on just his fourth reception of the game, a 43-yard catch-and-run, and finished the game with 123 yards.
Junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor looked capable of filling former All-American wide receiver Marqise Lee’s shoes as the Trojans’ No. 1 wideout at times, but dropped a few easy catches as well. In addition to hauling in two touchdowns, Agholor had a circus catch that bounced off his helmet and into his hands in the second quarter.
After a high-scoring first quarter for USC, the train came off the tracks a bit in the second. Sophomore running back Justin Davis lost a fumble on Fresno State’s 42-yard line, but Fresno State quarterback Brandon Connette returned the favor by throwing an interception to senior safety Gerald Bowman. The Trojans handed the ball right back over, though, when redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen fumbled again.
Like Bowman, junior defensive end Leonard Williams also hauled in the second interception of his career on Saturday.
“It felt pretty, wild to be honest,” Williams said. “I got one freshman year and even that one felt like it was good luck or something. I never thought I’d get another one. It felt crazy, it just happened so fast.”
While Kessler and the Trojan defense flexed their muscles Saturday evening, the Fresno State signal callers struggled all game.
Fresno State entered the game with no clear frontrunner at quarterback. Head coach Tim DeRuyter started Brian Burrell, but after he went 3-for-6 with only 14 yards in a little over a quarter of action, DeRuyter replaced Burrell with Connette, who transferred this spring from Duke. The two alternated throughout the game and finished with a combined 150 yards.
Though the Bulldogs struggled on offense in the first half, they came out strong to start off the second. The Trojan defense looked sluggish, letting up a bit after the offense had built up a 31-7 lead at the half.
The Bulldogs marched down the field and running back Marteze Waller punched in his second of two rushing touchdowns on the day. After a failed extra point by Fresno State kicker Colin McGuire, the score sat at 31-13.
The Trojan offense responded, though, reeling off two straight touchdowns after that to increase their lead to 45-13. Allen, the 2013 team MVP, busted through Fresno State’s defense for a nine-yard touchdown before Kessler connected with Dixon for the Oxnard, California native’s first receiving touchdown as a Trojan.
Kessler and the crop of freshmen stole the show, but there’s much to be said about USC’s defense as well — the Trojans held the Bulldogs to 317 total yards of offense, most of which came in the second half.
With such a big lead in the second half, Sarkisian allowed redshirt freshman quarterback Max Browne to get his first reps as a Trojan. Browne looked like a capable future leader, going 3-for-4 for 30 yards.
Despite the record-setting performance and the impressive debuts of so many freshmen, Sarkisian immediately brought attention to the game on the horizon. The Trojans must now prepare to head north to Palo Alto, California to begin Pac-12 play against Stanford, who has been a thorn in USC’s side for years.
“We’ll enjoy it for a moment,” Sarkisian said. “We gotta get back to work.”

From The Hunger Games’ Katniss to Frozen’s Elsa, recent blockbusters have favored portraying strong female protagonists. The number of women on-screen, however, doesn’t translate to a large number of women behind-the-scenes, with just 6 percent of 2013’s top-grossing films being directed by women.
Taking aim at empowerment · Though films such as The Hunger Games series feature prominent female protagonists, there has been a lack of women involved in the behind-the-scenes process of filmmaking. – Photo courtesy of Lionsgate Films
Meena Ramamurthy, a third-year graduate student in Cinematic Arts pursuing her Master of Fine Arts degree in film production, witnesses this statistic on a daily basis. Overall, only 16 percent of behind-the-scenes movie positions in 2013 were held by women, a decrease since 2012.
“It’s tough for women to break into those upper-level positions,” Ramamurthy said. “[As a woman], your stuff has to be nearly twice as good, because maybe you won’t scream the loudest but your work will need to speak for itself.”
The lack of support for female filmmakers sparked Ramamurthy’s idea to form the Cinema School Calendar Girls 2014, which raises awareness of the limited representation of female filmmakers while simultaneously raising money for future women in cinema.
The project began as an assignment for an intermediate cinematography class. While other students sought out images of stunning landscapes and the downtown skyline, Ramamurthy had an entirely different idea.
“I thought it would be fun to shoot girls from our production program and use the proceeds towards scholarships,” she said.
She then posted her calendar on the crowdfunding website Indiegogo at the end of July, with the goal of raising $500 within a month. The project ended up earning more than triple that.
What began as just a “funny project” for Ramamurthy received an outpouring of support from both female and male filmmakers, and ended up raising $1,610.
Supporters paid $10 for each calendar. Donors also had the option to give other amounts, ranging from $1 for a “high five” to $50 for up to five calendars autographed by the calendar girls.
Ramamurthy describes the calendar as a “parody of a women’s swimsuit calendar,” because it showcases women who don’t work in front of the camera. Aspiring female editors, directors and producers were all featured in the calendar.
All proceeds from the calendar went directly to the School of Cinematic Arts as scholarship funds for future women in cinema. Ramamurthy worked intensively with the Student Services department to develop the scholarship, which is unique in the fact that it’s product-based.
“[The School of Cinematic Arts] has never done a student-initiated scholarship based on the sale of products,” Ramamurthy said.
Her own interest in cinematography began at a young age. Originally from a small town in Texas, Ramamurthy recalled that “there wasn’t much to do when I was a kid, so my best friend and I went to each others’ houses and wrote really bad scripts.”
This sparked the future cinema student’s lifelong passion for filmmaking.
Tina Fey and Mindy Kaling are the two women currently in the film industry that Ramamurthy admires the most, which isn’t surprising considering the fact that Ramamurthy eventually wants to be a comedy writer.
“They created their own market and did not wait for the rest of the industry to catch up,” Ramamurthy said.
After studying radio, television and English at the University of Texas at Austin, Ramamurthy launched her career as a filmmaker. She interned with the Disney Channel in Los Angeles, and then worked on a show for National Public Radio in New York City. Unfortunately, the show she worked on was cancelled when the recession hit, so she moved back home.
Ramamurthy then applied to USC’s School of Cinematic Arts’ M.F.A. program and earned a directing scholarship. The scholarship mainly served as a source of motivation.
“[The scholarship] was a significant amount but not enough to cover the cost of tuition,” she said. “But, for me, it meant more that someone saw that I had potential as a director.”
Ramamurthy hopes that the scholarship award funded by her project will encourage other young female filmmakers to break the industry’s glass ceiling.
For her, the main goal with the calendar project is to end the “boys’ club” mentality of filmmaking that she believes harms the industry’s film quality.
“It’s important to have diversity in filmmaking,” she said. “Filmmaking, storytelling and art help us understand each other better, and film is a great medium to experience the way someone lives.”

The James Dean stage, one of the three stages at the first Budweiser Made in America Los Angeles festival, hosted a wild crowd atop the hilly Grand Park. Unlike the other areas at the event, the James Dean stage was specifically dedicated to hardcore underground ravers; the scene was closer to that of Ultra and EDC music festivals more than the laid-back, boho-vibe Coachella. Over the weekend, people would walk up to the James Dean stage in between listening to Rita Ora and Kendrick Lamar at the main stage (dubbed the “Marilyn” stage) for an hour or so of dancing and head banging. D.J.s who performed included Borgore and DVBBS.
As the festival goers jumped together in sync, moving their arms to the booming bass system, Australian D.J. Will Sparks looked like he was having the time of his life on stage, mixing techno beats and yelling out to his audience enthusiastically. Donning his signature pulled-back hairstyle, the young D.J. revved the crowd into a high-energy mosh pit as they cheered him on. Though Sparks was not a major headliner this weekend, he didn’t let big names like Steve Aoki overshadow his performance. His eclectic style appeals to a certain type of fan, and it was clear that those fans who knew him came for him. Those familiar with his sets from attending music festivals such as Ultra or TomorrowWorld were excited to see him again, and those who had no idea who he was, became fans.
Sparks’s repertoire includes shows in his hometown of Melbourne, Australia, as well as Ibiza, Las Vegas, New York and now the inaugural Made in America festival in Los Angeles. He was introduced to music at the age of 13 when he started playing the guitar. Half a decade later, he began mixing music and uploading his mixes on to Soundcloud, an online audio distribution platform. It started with his friends and family, who shared his music with their circles, earning him notoriety for his remixes and original songs.
“It was Melbourne Underground five years ago,” Sparks said. “I instantly fell in love; I almost became obsessed. I completely changed. I bought myself some turntables after I watched [the D.J.s] every week. I became good friends with them, getting into the studio, seeing what they do and getting my own sh-t. Then I left school, practiced and now we’re in [Los Angeles].”
Reflecting back on his start in the music industry, Sparks laughed at the time when he used to jump the fence into Melbourne’s underground music scene at a club near his home. Sparks had no connections that helped make his entrance into the industry smoother or easier. Because of this, he’s thankful for all the people who encouraged him to stick with his goals, even when he decided to drop out of school to fulfill his dreams.
“My mum’s an artist, and she was like, ‘Just do it, you’ll be fine.’ I left in year 11, just went home and made music,” Sparks said. “I was a Soundcloud kid. I started on Soundcloud and that’s how you build your following, and all of a sudden it just blows.”
Most amateur D.J.s are known for repetitive bass beats that are easily replicated. Sparks, on the other hand, tries to stay away from mainstream sounds, offering a host of remixes that mesh typical bass-heavy house music with a variety of genres, from popular songs by Robin Thicke to underground music by Timmy Trumpet and Chardy.
Most of those who were excited for Sparks or who had heard of the up-and-coming D.J. were college students. Sparks, in his early 20’s, appeals to a similar age group as his fans, which helps him connect with his audience on a lifestyle level. A laid-back, fun-loving Australian, he enjoys the social scene of people of his age and admitted to visiting USC in the past to find out for himself what Greek life and fraternity parties are all about.
Sparks seems to have had a lot of experience as he was forced to learn the ins and outs of the entertainment business himself. He applies these lessons to his own life on a daily basis.
“If I had to give Trojans advice, I’d say you just have to work at it,” Sparks said. “If you love it, what’s stopping you? If you’re actually good at what you love, if the pressure doesn’t bring you down, and the pressure helps you, you want it more. That’s when you know.”
Instead of listening to your usual pregame playlist, search the D.J.’s name on Soundcloud or Spotify to get amped up for the night. D.J. Will Sparks’ intoxicating energy will surely carry you past midnight. For a good time, Sparks’s debut album will be out soon, but his genre-meshing remixes are also still on Soundcloud. He will be in North America for a few shows as well before he heads home later this year. Prepare for the drop.

On Monday, Robin Williams’ daughter, Zelda, returned to Twitter for the first time since Aug. 13 with this inspiring message: “Never be bullied into silence. Never allow yourself to be made a victim. Accept no one’s definition of your life; define yourself,” a quote by Harvey Fierstein, who co-starred with Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. Her tweet seems to be a response to everyone who so harshly judged her father’s suicide.
According to the Los Angeles Times, publicist Mara Buxbaum said that Robin Williams had been “battling severe depression of late,” and that his death was “a tragic and sudden loss.” Though Buxbaum said “[t]he family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time,” one man couldn’t respect such a request.
In his broadcast on Fox News, anchor Shepard Smith called Williams a coward for his suicide. On the morning of Williams’ death, Smith said, “[S]omething inside you is so horrible or you’re such a coward or whatever the reason that you decide that you have to end it. Robin Williams, at 63, did that today.” Smith’s lack of respect for the comedian’s death sparked outrage. While the world grieved over the loss of such an incredible comedian, Smith somehow found it appropriate to pass judgment on the situation. To be so disparaging on such a tragic day is both despicable and disrespectful to anyone who loved and cherished Williams.
Depression is something often misunderstood by those who have not experienced it firsthand. According to the Mayo Clinic, it is a “mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest.” It also affects an individual’s emotions, thinking process and behavior. Those who are wrongfully critical of Williams’ choice of suicide to end his life need to understand that depression cannot always be fixed, even with medication and therapy.
When Smith’s comment about Williams’ death went viral, media outrage forced him to publicly apologize for his poor choice of words. According to Variety, Smith told TVNewser, “The last thing I would ever suggest about a man I know nothing about personally, is that he’s a coward. That goes against everything I am. If those words I used so innocently[sic] offended his family, from the bottom of my heart, I could not be more sorry.” What must be noted about this statement is that it shows how much this apology lacks sincerity. Smith said that he used the words “so innocently” and that if they “offended his family” he was sorry — not once does he admit that what he said was truly wrong.
One man’s lack of empathy and inability to understand the medical aspects of depression points to a larger underlying social issue. Often, when someone with depression comes forward — even just to loved ones — he or she is misunderstood. In a Huffington Post blog, writer Marilyn Sewell wrote, “When [people affected by depression] dare to speak the truth to intimates or friends, [they] see bewilderment and frustration in [others’] eyes.”
Smith’s statement reveals how much of society still lives in denial about the causes, treatments and effects that depression has on a life. After Williams’ death, however, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and similar crisis lines received almost twice as many calls as usual.
Though Williams’ death was both premature and terribly tragic, it has sparked an initiative for both those affected with depression to seek help and for those unaffected to reach out and try to understand.

National attention to the continued protests following the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri has shed light on racial profiling here at USC. The widespread exposure the incident garnered encouraged many students to think more about the significant racial issues closer to home.

Just two days after Michael Brown’s death, the Los Angeles Police Department shot and killed Ezell Ford, a mentally ill black man wandering the streets of Florence in South Los Angeles — just over three miles away from USC’s campus. Though controversy about the specific circumstances of Ford’s death ensued, one thing was clear: Police brutality is a visible, terrifying threat for communities of color.
“It could be any one of us at any given time,” said executive director of the USC Black Student Assembly, Casey Ellis. “That’s why [Ferguson] didn’t come as a shock to anyone. No one was like, ‘Oh my gosh, how could this happen?’ It was more like, ‘Oh my gosh, how could this happen again for the umpteenth time this summer alone?’”
For the black community in Los Angeles and nationwide, the death of Michael Brown is only a reminder of the many gruesome possibilities that could follow a misunderstood reach to the pocket for a wallet or ID. Ferguson exploded not because the fate of Michael Brown is so shocking, but rather because it is so relatable — it is an amplified reminder of everyday race relations.
On campus, racial profiling remains a constant concern for the black community. According to Ellis, even Dept. of Public Safety Chief John Thomas has been stopped by Contemporary Services Corporation security officials and asked to show his ID.
“People don’t think that it happens, but if Chief Thomas is stopped, then it happens,” Ellis said. “I don’t think you can find one guy, in my constituency at least, who hasn’t been approached by a DPS officer or CSC patrol on campus and asked to show their ID even if it’s not after 9 p.m. They’re confronted with mistrust immediately because of their presence.”
The next question, then, is how the campus community can educate students about racial profiling and hold officials responsible — and eventually bridge the mistrust between citizens and authority figures present in many communities of people of color. Last summer, the Black Student Assembly addressed the issue by discussing possible procedures to properly train officers, who might have preconceived notions about the community they serve.
“For the most part the officers who patrol areas that are heavily black or heavily Latino are not black and Latino, so they don’t come from the area and may not understand the culture and may already come in with built-in prejudices,” Ellis said.
On a local level, community efforts have vast potential to reduce racial profiling. Policymakers, however, must be wary of solutions that conveniently overlook the conspicuous prejudice among local authority figures — including President Obama’s social program, “My Brother’s Keeper,”- which promotes education to curb crime and poverty. This issue is not about the danger of black men; it is about maintaining accountability of police who use intimidation tactics and abuse power.
For once, let’s hear that young black men will be recognized as humans instead of hooligans. Communities that teach young black adults that they must hide from the cops to survive don’t forge trust between civilians and the police force; they destroy it. When police intimidation is the main instrument of discipline, there will never exist a community in which people of color can truly depend on their law enforcement.
It’s time for USC to take a stand. University officials must back up endeavors to resolve the issue. USC must use its monetary and professional clout to encourage and support community efforts to create acceptance between black neighborhoods and the often white authority figures that patrol them. They should instill more officer education programs and encourage greater transparency within the LAPD. Together, USC and the community can create a mutual bond of trust, uniting local police and citizens alike.
For the first time, the community must say that Los Angeles’ Ezell Ford will be the last one and mean it. Let’s live up to our promise—so that Ferguson’s protesters will help someone do something. Let’s translate their sacrifices into action. And let’s make sure this will never happen again.
 
When black people stop committing crimes (particularly violent ones) at a much higher rate than other races, then they will stop being profiled. And not a day sooner!
