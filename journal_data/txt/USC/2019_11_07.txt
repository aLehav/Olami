The past editions of this column have mainly focused on commonalities between sports and music through the nature of certain industry practices. But one thing I’ve noticed over the past few weeks is that one of the most common elements between music and sports is the behavior of fans. 
One of my roommates helped bring me to this revelation when he burst into our apartment and announced, “This ‘Jesus Is King’ album is growing on me.”
I, as the curious journalist I am, responded by asking what exact aspects of the album have grown on him. The living room fell silent for a comically long amount of time, with the only background noise being an obsolete Cardinal Gardens air conditioner and the commentary of a Brooklyn Nets versus New Orleans Pelicans game.
A late-game dunk from Nets center Jarrett Allen, followed by the realization that my Pelicans were en route to becoming 1-6, halted my laughter and made me understand just how similar my roommate and I were in that moment.
He had been so blinded by his fandom of Kanye West’s music that “Closed on Sunday / you my Chick-fil-A / You’re my number one / with the lemonade,” was a hook he was willing to wholeheartedly defend. 
And I was no better. I had watched enough Brandon Ingram highlights to convince myself that a team ranked second-to-last in defensive rating could somehow sneak its way into the playoffs. 
This singular parallel made me more observant toward any other possible similarities between the two fan groups, and what I found was that the groups are nearly identical in their respective adorations. 
One of my most prominent observations was that fans of music and sports find strong sentiments in certain performances that outsiders could never truly understand. 
The term “cult classic” — to be obscure or unpopular with mainstream audiences and often revolutionary or ironically enjoyed — comes to mind for music fans despite it usually pertaining to film. 
For example, in 2013, Justin Bieber released “Journals,” and music critics saw it as nothing special; the Chicago Tribune gave the project two out of four stars and encouraged Bieber to take a break from music altogether. 
Meanwhile, the album has a 97% user approval on Google and 4.9 out of five rating on Amazon Music. Fans of the album, myself proudly included, enjoy the project despite what mainstream critic reviews have to say.
The same goes for sports, as fans find themselves forever attached to a particular season or roster even if the end result isn’t one the average observer would appreciate. 
Think of Golden State fans’ attachment to the “We Believe” Warriors. Despite Golden State having one of the greatest dynasties in NBA history and arguably the most talented roster ever in the ‘17-18 season, a majority of real (emphasis on real) Warriors fans will refer to the ‘06-07 team as their personal favorite bunch. 
A roster of misfits and castaways managed to barely make the playoffs and defeat the No. 1 ranked team in the NBA. 
That’s it. 
They didn’t win a championship, and main pieces like Baron Davis and Jason Richardson were gone the very next year. Analysts don’t ever mention the team as an all-time great, but that ‘06-07 group will forever hold a special place in the heart of any real (again, emphasis on real) Warriors fan’s heart, evidenced by Golden State playing their last home game in Oracle Arena in the uniforms that the “We Believe” team made famous.
Aside from attachments to unheralded performances and sharing in denial of poor ones, music and sports fans share in many more similar elements, like excitement toward music snippets and workout videos and their pride in being fans before their idols’ successes. The last element I want to highlight, though, is the pretentious nature of certain fans in both demographics. 
For example, I have been a fan of J. Cole since George W. Bush was president, but talking to a fellow Cole fan is like sitting in a Marshall School of Business class — every word is carefully uttered to let you know that they’re better than their peers.
The same goes for Patriots fans, Lakers fans and fans of any other storied sports franchise. They have been spoiled by sustained excellence to the point where they feel entitled to a championship every few years, and any team that hasn’t beaten their team in meaningful postseason play is cast aside as basically a minor league team. 
Regardless of whether they’re engaging in music or sports, fans are fans and they have more in common than most would think.

The No. 9 USC women’s soccer team will face No. 14 UCLA to close Pac-12 play Friday. 
The Trojans have not beaten their crosstown rivals since 2015, as UCLA has taken the final game of USC’s season three years in a row.  
“We’ve been really unfortunate in some of the breaks that have happened in the game; some of our own doing but also just the way soccer is,” McAlpine said of the losing streak to the Bruins. “I thought last year we controlled a lot of the game and [then] let it get away from us.”
USC and UCLA have both established themselves as powerhouse soccer programs in recent years and have historically played competitive, intense games in their matchups. However, UCLA has had the upper hand in the all-time series, as USC has only knocked off its foe six times in 32 matchups. 
The game this year is shaping up to be another high-stakes affair as the winner will claim outright second place in the Pac-12 behind Stanford. USC and UCLA are currently tied with a 7-3 record in conference play.
“It helps us in preparation long term, because they are such a quality team,” McAlpine said. “[And] in terms of the atmosphere, it gives us the feel of the later rounds of a national championship run.”
USC started out the year strong, achieving one of the best starts in school history while ranking as high as No. 2 in the nation. However, the team began showing signs of weakness after a tie with Baylor and has since dropped three crucial conference games.  
On the flip side, UCLA also got off to a quick start, knocking off then-No. 1 Florida State in dominant fashion. But the Bruins fizzled out after getting upset by Santa Clara, which is now ranked No. 20 in the nation and dropping two straight to Cal and Arizona.  
Neither USC nor UCLA have many wins against quality opponents. Aside from both teams’ wins over FSU, UCLA beat No. 11 Wisconsin, while USC has beaten no other relevant team.  
However, both programs have put together successful enough resumes to maintain their national championship aspirations.  
USC heads into the game returning from a successful trip to Oregon and Oregon State, where the defense allowed no goals and has built some momentum after faltering against Cal and Washington.
This season, the Trojans have relied heavily on the offensive duo of sophomore forward Penelope Hocking and junior forward Tara McKeown. The two are responsible for a hefty load of USC’s scoring, but redshirt senior midfielder Natalie Jacobs has quietly accumulated six assists on the season to go with her 2 goals as well.  
The return of redshirt junior goalie Kaylie Collins from an injury has also been huge for the Trojans, although sophomore goalie Anna Smith was impressive in her place. Collins is 5-1 as the starter and has totaled 19 saves on the season.  
However, the Trojans have faced a few injuries as the season has progressed, and the team looks different than it did early on. 
“We definitely have some different personnel, but I think all in all, I think it will be a really good game,” junior midfielder Alea Hyatt said.
UCLA will field a defense that has totaled 10 shutouts on the season to pair with a highly-balanced offense that has yet to see a player reach double digit goals. UCLA has passed the ball well this year — eight Bruins have scored at least 2 goals on the season, compared to only four for the Trojans.
“Every last player has to be locked in defensively to their assignments,” McAlpine said of the team’s defensive approach. “We have to recognize who their most dangerous players are, but at the same time be committed to communicating all the switches and movement they have within their offense.”
Hyatt echoed McAlpine’s emphasis on playing defense as a cohesive unit in order to stop the Bruins’ potent attack and pointed to the other things USC will need to keep in mind ahead of Friday’s game.  
“Defending together, being a unit, making sure we’ve got everybody behind the ball and really working hard for each other,” Hyatt said of the Trojans’ keys to emerging victorious. 
USC vs. UCLA has been and will always be a competitive matchup in women’s soccer, and this week should be no different. A win for USC would mean snapping a three-year losing streak to the Bruins, gaining sole second place in the Pac-12 and making a solid statement win before the postseason.  
The Trojans’ regular season finale kicks off at 6 p.m. Friday at UCLA Wallis Annenberg Stadium.

The USC football team will travel to Tempe, Ariz., this weekend to take on the Arizona State Sun Devils Saturday.
USC leads the all-time series 21-13, including a 10-7 advantage in Tempe. The Sun Devils enter with a 5-3 overall record and a 2-3 mark in the Pac-12. 
A win this weekend is crucial for USC, as it would render the Trojans (5-4, 4-2 in the Pac-12) bowl-eligible after failing to reach a bowl game last season. Additionally, a victory on Saturday is necessary for the team to maintain any chance at a spot in the Pac-12 Championship Game.
USC is coming off a beatdown on its home turf at the hands of No. 7 Oregon last week and will now hit the road, where it has struggled this season. The Trojans have won only one of four games this season away from the Coliseum — the one win being a 4-point nailbiter against Colorado, a game in which USC faced multiple 10-point deficits.
Despite the inconsistency and the deflating loss to the Ducks, head coach Clay Helton remains at the helm of the ship — for now. Helton said that the team has done a good job of bouncing back from the recent home loss and getting back to work on the practice field. 
Offensive coordinator Graham Harrell spoke to USC’s inconsistent offense, which will need to limit turnovers this weekend. 
“I think consistency can obviously help with the turnovers but also, across the board, just doing your job,” Harrell said. “We move the ball really well up and down [the field] and then get killed because of one small inconsistent play.”
The Arizona State offense is led by true freshman quarterback Jayden Daniels, who has rushed for 273 yards this season. USC has struggled to control mobile quarterbacks, and Daniels will put the Trojan defense to the test. 
USC defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said one of the biggest takeaways from the Oregon game that USC will have to improve against ASU is second half mistakes. 
USC is No. 130 — dead last in the nation — in forcing opponents into three-and-outs. To solve that, the Trojans will need to be precise in their assignments, execute and finish tackles, which they have struggled with occasionally this year. 
USC is led by a true freshman quarterback of its own: Kedon Slovis. Slovis will continue to work on reading the field this week, and Harrell said his quarterback must play smart against the Sun Devils and not try to make plays that aren’t there. 
“He has to have a sense [that] taking a sack is not always the worst thing, or throwing the football away is not always the worst thing,” Harrell said. 
The Trojans’ offense this season has been driven by its wide receivers. Senior Michael Pittman Jr., redshirt junior Tyler Vaughns and sophomore Amon-Ra St. Brown have kept USC in several games this year, and the Sun Devils know they’ll have to slow them down this weekend. 
“They have a good wide receiving corps, so we all have to be on our A-game,” Arizona State sophomore safety Aashari Crosswell told AZ Central. “They’re playmakers, all three of them.”
The Trojans plan to keep it simple, though, as they have all season. Despite the big loss last weekend, USC is preparing for this upcoming matchup as it would for any other game. 
“They’re a talented group, they do a lot of different things defensively to try to trick you,” Slovis said of ASU. “But as we’ve said all year, if we execute, we’ll be successful.” 
This upcoming game will take place just days after USC announced the hiring of its new athletic director, Mike Bohn. The hire marks a new chapter for USC Athletics, and perhaps the Trojans will gain some much-needed stability both on and off the field. 
It will be Bohn’s decision to keep or release Helton, and unless USC can crack the Pac-12 championship game and make a run at the Rose Bowl, many expect Bohn will ultimately choose the latter. 
Helton must start winning if he wants a better chance to keep his job, starting this weekend.
The game kicks off in Sun Devil Stadium at 12:30 p.m. and will be broadcast live on ABC.

The Panhellenic and Interfraternity councils will aim to promote mental health awareness and fundraise for campus resources at its inaugural Row Run Sunday. 
Runners will travel a nearly two-mile course through the Row, down University Avenue and through campus to end back at Greek Row. Twenty-eighth Street will also be closed during the event. All proceeds from the run will go toward USC Student Health mental health resources. 
Robert Tiscareno Jr. and Thomas Mehdi, two former philanthropy chairs of the Sigma Nu fraternity, started planning the event in Spring 2019 as a philanthropic event led by their fraternity. But the duo expanded the event to reach a larger portion of the USC community after partnering with Undergraduate Student Government and USC Student Health. 
“[Mental health] is something that in some sense has affected everyone and maybe not directly an individual, but they know someone that has been affected,” Tiscareno said.
IFC President Matteo Mendoza said Tiscareno and Medhi presented the idea and IFC decided to support the event on a larger scale. 
“We thought what’s one issue that you can pertain to anyone regardless of who you are and we decided that mental health issues [are] something that can affect anyone,” Mehdi, a junior majoring in business administration, said.
Mendoza, a junior majoring in business administration, then took charge by coordinating with the various external organizations that IFC has since partnered with to establish the Row Run as a university-wide event. 
“I think everybody is incredibly excited about this opportunity for us to all come together for a good cause, that being raising awareness and proceeds for mental health initiatives on campus,” Mendoza said.
Mendoza said he hopes to hold the event every year and grow it to attract local sponsors and faculty and staff members as well. 
USG President Trenton Stone said student government decided to partner with the event to raise more money for mental health resources on campus.
“Mental health and well-being are issues that affect the entire USC community,” he said. “When they talked about a Row Run, I definitely wanted to be able to help expand that to include more people across USC rather than just people who are involved in Greek life.”
Department of Public Safety Lt. Mark Cervenak said that IFC presented its plans for the Row Run during a department meeting. 
“There was a number of USC stakeholders at that meeting including management services, transportation services, fire and safety, hospitality, and we discussed it thoroughly,” Cervenak said. “The big question, of course, is that it is going to affect the streets and areas around the campus. We need to make sure for the overall safety of the event that there is a law enforcement presence and a traffic control presence.”
Cervenak also said DPS discussed ensuring the safety of those in the neighborhood, and on Sunday, officers will be present. 
Tiscareno, a junior majoring in real estate development, said all the event’s proceeds will be donated to mental health initiatives at USC. 
USC Student Health has said it will open the fifth floor of the Engemann Student Health Center, which will be dedicated solely to long-term mental health resources including additional counselors, by the end of the semester. 
USG held a town hall Oct. 24 where several students expressed concerns about the accessibility and effectiveness of USC’s current mental health resources. Nearly 100 students, faculty and staff attended the USC Inter-Health Council’s Student Health Town Hall in February to tell a panel of faculty and Student Health officials about long wait times for mental health services and low counselor-to-student ratios. 
To sign up, Tiscareno said students can buy $10 tickets online at RaceRoster.com or for $15 in-person Sunday. 
Since the event was first pitched in February, Tiscareno said it has grown beyond its original scope, both in terms of the organizations involved and the positive response thus far. 
“The event right now has been taken to a place that we didn’t imagine that it would go,” Tiscareno said.
Maria Eberhart and Sasha Urban contributed to this report.

Last month, on the United Nations International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, senior Jocelyn Woods spoke at the UN Headquarters in New York City. 
Woods, who’s majoring in journalism, spoke on the issue of child poverty alongside Comic Relief USA, a nonprofit “built on the foundation that the power of entertainment can drive positive change.”
The event, which was called the 17on17Summit: Global Partnerships to End Child Poverty, aimed to accelerate progress toward ending child poverty by bringing together a diverse group of people with different perspectives, experiences and knowledge on the issue. The event highlighted the voices of young people around the world who wish to speak out on today’s global issues.
Before entering USC on a full scholarship, Woods grew up in a low-income community with limited resources. Through her youth, she found stability and support at the Boys & Girls Club, a national organization that provides after-school programs and classes for young people, especially from minority communities. It was this experience that taught her the importance of social good and advocating for the less fortunate.
“I didn’t have much during most of my formative years. I was a beneficiary of volunteer work,” Woods said. “I guess I credit my start to advocacy and giving back to others with my mentors at the Boys & Girls Club.”
During her freshman year, Woods was named National Youth of the Year of the Boys & Girls Club, an award given to a select few students who demonstrate outstanding leadership skills and a passion in the field of community advocacy. 
Adam Hernandez, unit director of the Boys & Girls Club, said he met Woods as a member of the club. 
“Tenacity is the first word that comes to mind. When she puts her mind to something, that’s how it’s going to be,” Hernandez said. “It doesn’t matter if she’s gonna fail 100 times in a row. She’s still gonna keep going at it. She has no fear. She’s willing to dive in and then take it from there.”
Woods also credits her mother with instilling in her a passion for advocacy and giving back on social justice issues, like issues of juvenile incarceration and child poverty. Woods emphasizes her dedication to the cause of universal education for the impoverished as a catalyst to break the cycle of poverty.
Woods is also involved with alternative spring breaks, which gives students the opportunity to travel the world and learn about global issues. 
“Through most of my years at USC, I went on alternative breaks,” Woods said. “Since I was a freshman I started going on them and then sophomore year, I started to lead them.”
Now though, she said she’s “just writing, directing and telling meaningful stories that will change the world.” 
Woods is currently writing her senior capstone thesis on facial recognition and Generation Z students. However, upon leaving USC, Woods plans to continue to improve the world around her.
“I’m just really passionate about making meaningful art that changes the world for the better, and there’s not that bridge between advocacy and growing up the way I did in the entertainment industry. So I just want to start there and go to law school,” Woods said. “I didn’t know for a long time that I even had a story that was worth telling. So I think everyone does, and once you find out that you have a story to tell, tell it and that’s how you make a difference.”
Ugonnaya Chilaka, a senior majoring in business administration who has known and lived with Woods since their freshman year, said Woods’ commitment to advocacy and community service is unique.
“[She’s] just a really hardworking and talented person. She’s done so many things, and the UN is just one in a long list of accomplishments,” Chilaka said. “For other people who are younger who are coming from backgrounds where they might feel like they can’t transcend their conditions, she’s an inspiration.”

Political disillusionment is a common sentiment among college-aged people. Because of this, it may feel exhausting and frustrating to have a stake in the current political climate. Many of the problems facing our country are not only issues that young people haven’t had a hand in creating, but also ones that they haven’t had a hand in voting on until recently. Coupled with political polarization and division, many wonder why would they involve themselves in unsolvable controversy anyway. 
Averse feelings to the political atmosphere is justified, but it’s important to distinguish the difference between disillusionment and disengagement. A failure to engage in the issues that matter personally, as well as those that affect the rest of the community, are a waste of opportunity and can have more severe consequences later on. 
Political inactivity contributes to and reinforces many of the concerns of those representing the politically disillusioned. This includes deciding not to be informed, deciding not to engage in tough conversations and deciding not to vote. All collectively work to increase polarity. 
Misinformation and ignorance go hand in hand with the partisanship — the less you know about a subject, the more likely people are to make uninformed decisions about it and refer to the more tribal sides of the argument rather than the most rationally considered. 
People are more likely to feel disillusioned by a system if they see a bureaucracy doing nothing for them. Yet how is a system able to do right by its people when engagement and interest from its constituency is low?
It’s critical to consider how opportunities to engage are often a privilege in the U.S. in contrast to the political systems in other countries. People in the U.S. — regardless of whether they have citizenship or not — are able to participate in the political process in ways that go beyond simply voting. 
Beyond this, political ignorance is also often reflective of the belief that political and  economic issues  as well as social concerns do not personally affect you and are therefore pursuits that are irrelevant and unworthy of one’s time. The truth of the matter though is that while an issue may not have direct implications for a person, the political is always personal. 
Opportunities to get informed and decrease one’s own ignorance about an issue are made particularly accessible at USC. The University offers spaces for engagement on both the local and international levels, through offering debate watch events, speakers series with esteemed faculty and visitors from various political backgrounds and roundtable discussions. 
Institutions like the Center for the Political Future and the Global Policy Institute are two programs offered on campus that connect students with speakers, conversations and resources for political engagement. 
Whether or not you are studying politics, these programs at USC are available for everyone to take part in. College campuses are home to individuals representing so many different sectors of society — medical professionals, engineers and business people to name a few, so including everyone in the conversation only improves the quality of political discourse in terms of all allowing various ideas heard and addressed.  
Exercising civic duty and becoming more politically engaged is only one part of the even greater conversation to be had about what it means to be part of a community. Disillusionment and apathy are common feelings, but it doesn’t mean they should ever inform the more rational decisions we make.
Political engagement is ultimately a privilege afforded, almost more so to young people than others; it must be practiced and taken advantage of to dismantle any of the obstacles otherwise present in our system.

To many USC students, having a car in Los Angeles is essential. In many cases, from going to an internship to going to the movies, it’s simply the fastest and most convenient way to get around. But while it may be convenient, students ought to keep in mind that driving is not always necessary, especially when going short distances. And more than that, driving contributes to the serious problem of air pollution in L.A. As such, USC should be doing more to encourage students to take alternative, environmentally friendly transportation methods to and from campus. 
According to NBC, residents of L.A. county are exposed to 60% more vehicle pollution than the California state average. While there are certainly other causes of the infamous L.A. smog, according to the L.A. Times, cars account for about 60 to 70% of the air pollution in the L.A. area. Although there is an increase in the amount of environmentally friendly vehicles being made, driving remains an unsustainable method of mass-commuting. 
As described by USC on their Office of International Services page, “Cars are the most popular and convenient form of transportation in Los Angeles.” Considering L.A.’s spread-out nature as well an underdeveloped public transportation system, owning a car while living here is almost a give-in. So despite the growing awareness of the dangers of air pollution and greenhouse gases, it seems that L.A. refuses to sway from its driving-centric culture.
It’s important to remember that there are alternative forms of transportation available for traveling short distances, especially in the area around USC. For those students who live in the USC area, getting to campus doesn’t and shouldn’t require a car. In fact, most students opt to bike, board or walk to class each day. 
Despite alternative modes of transport, many students who live around University Park still choose to drive to school because of its convenience. It seems that these driving habits are made possible by the school. USC enables students to drive to and from campus by offering parking spots. While many students do genuinely need these spots due to disability, injury or the need to transport equipment, the University should put more emphasis on discouraging those who don’t need to drive on their commute to campus. 
Not only are there other alternatives such as biking and boarding, but in some cases, USC even offers shared transportation options such as shuttle or bus services. Many of the USC housing options are either within walking or biking distance or come with a shuttle service. The Lorenzo operates shuttles that run every 20 minutes specifically to take students to and from campus. While these shuttles do contribute to the vehicle emissions problem, they at least promote carpooling and cut down on the number of vehicles being driven.
Certainly, USC does not need to stop offering on-campus parking to students. Many students do rely on driving to transport equipment to campus or because they are unable to walk or bike. Some students may even opt to drive because they believe that it is the safest way of getting around the USC area, especially at night. However, there are still better ways to get to and from campus in the evenings. USC offers nighttime carpool programs such as free Lyft and Campus Cruiser.
In sum, the school should do a better job of discouraging those who don’t necessarily need to drive. Charging a flat, monthly or semester-long parking rate to students only encourages them to use their on-campus parking spots more frequently throughout the semester.  
Given the myriad transportation options available to students living in the USC area, such as biking or even good-old-fashioned walking, and considering the ongoing climate crisis, it seems odd that USC continues to promote driving to campus as a commuting option for local students. Now, more than ever, our community needs to focus on supporting environmentally friendly methods of transportation for students rather than those that are unsustainable.

USC officially announced former University of Cincinnati athletic director Mike Bohn as the USC’s athletic director Thursday morning. The University hopes Bohn’s experience proves invaluable as the school’s athletic department looks to confront several major challenges in the coming years.
USC Athletics has recently been marred by scandal. During previous athletic director Lynn Swann’s three-year term, USC found itself involved in a federal investigation into college basketball’s pay-for-play infractions. USC was also heavily implicated in the recent college admissions scandal, in which members of the athletic department helped students gain admission to the University by falsely identifying them as athletic recruits. This prompted the indictment of associate athletic director Donna Heinel and former water polo head coach Jovan Vavic, among other officials. 
“It always starts with playing by the rules, doing the right thing and most importantly, supporting our student-athletes,” Bohn said. “When you’re supporting your student-athletes and doing things to help them be successful, then you know you’re obviously focused on the right things in pulling it together.”
With the exception of a Rose Bowl victory in 2017, USC’s football team has failed to return to the prominence it enjoyed during the 2000s, and many fans are calling for the athletic department to replace current head coach Clay Helton. Bohn said he had not met Helton yet and that any talk of job status was premature.
“Just like any program this time of year, we expect them to finish strong,” Bohn said. “I’m not trying to add more pressure to him or the student-athletes that represent him, but we always want to finish strong. Good programs finish strong.”
Bohn replaces interim athletic director Dave Roberts. Roberts, who also serves as President Carol Folt’s special adviser, took the interim position following Swann’s resignation Sept. 9.
Folt introduced Bohn and said she is confident Bohn will fulfill her vision for a successful department that wins with integrity.
“[Bohn has] led athletic programs that are very competitive, have gone through changes and been even more competitive as they progressed, and he demands at all times the highest level of integrity of himself and of everyone who works for him,” Folt said.
Bohn is the first athletic director USC has hired without previous ties to the University since Mike McGee, who held the position from 1984 to 1993. Bohn said he thinks this gives him an advantage.
 “I believe I bring in a new perspective. Maybe something just a little bit different,” he said. “But I want to make sure you understand and want Trojans everywhere to understand that I have tremendous respect for the traditions, the history, the success and what USC Athletics stand for.”
Bohn arrives at University Park after serving as Cincinnati’s Athletic Director since 2014. While at Cincinnati, Bohn oversaw the revival of several of the university’s athletic programs and became a champion of Cincinnati’s attempts to join a Power Five football conference. 
In 2013, Bohn marshalled in an $86 million renovation to Nippert Stadium, the school’s football field. In 2016, he hired former Ohio State defensive coordinator Luke Fickell to take over as the school’s head coach. 
Despite missing out on a slot in the Big 12 conference during 2016 talks over conference realignment, the Bearcats have returned to college football relevance under Fickell’s tenure as head coach. The Bearcats are currently ranked No. 17 in the AP Top 25 and are 18-3 since the beginning of Fickell’s second season in 2018.
Bohn also sought to re-energize Cincinnati’s basketball programs during his term. In 2017, Cincinnati’s basketball arena received an $87 million renovation. Cincinnati’s men’s basketball team never failed to make the NCAA tournament during his time at the school, while Bohn’s 2018 hiring of women’s head basketball coach Michelle Clark-Heard helped the program reach its highest win total since 2002.
Prior to his tenure at Cincinnati, Bohn served as Colorado’s AD from 2005 to 2013. During his term in Boulder, Bohn oversaw the school’s successful transition from the Big 12 to the Pac-12. The three head football coaches he hired — Dan Hawkins, Jon Embree and Mike MacIntryre — were fired within five seasons of taking the job.  
Bohn said that his primary goal is to engage with student-athletes and ensure the athletic administration is centered around them.
“My intent is to listen, to learn and to lead — in that order,” Bohn said. “And ultimately, my goal is to deliver a bold, creative and innovative vision for our program that will position USC at the forefront of the intercollegiate athletics landscape for the present and the future. We want to be the best at every single thing that we do.”
