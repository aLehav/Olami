The setup is less than ideal. Playing in the Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, against a 6-7 team from the ACC? Not exactly somebody’s ideal New Year’s Eve plans.
Throw in the fact that kickoff is set for 11 a.m. on the west coast and I’m starting to question just how many people will even watch this game.
As has been well-established, this was not the ending to the 2012 season everyone pictured last summer. Underwhelming though it might be, there are many positives in watching this year’s edition of the Sun Bowl.
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley is expected to play in his final game. Many fans were left disappointed with Barkley’s play this season, which saw him fall from the Heisman favorite to a Pac-12 Honorable Mention selection.
Regardless of how he played on the field this season, Barkley should be respected for what he has done for this program. In the darkest of times, he led the team out of a situation that could have left the program in shambles. Barkley should be praised because he fought on, and we should all be thankful that we get a chance to see the Trojan legend take the field one last time, regardless of what bowl game it is.
Speaking of swan songs, another football icon will be making his final appearance for the Trojans: de facto defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin. Things never really did click for the USC defense under Kiffin’s tenure, and it’s sad to see a great father-son coaching story end this way.
But the elder Kiffin’s reputation is secure in football circles, and he should be celebrated as USC takes the field under his direction to try and slow up the Georgia Tech offense.
An extra game also gives fans the chance to see just how many times Lane Kiffin can call plays designed for Robert Woods as a last-ditch effort to lure him into returning for his senior season. Or, Lane could go the other way and call plays for Marqise Lee as a way to let Heisman voters know just how wrong they were to leave Lee out of their top three and to send a message as to who should be the favorite heading into next year.
Speaking of next year, one of the most significant aspects of bowl games is how they can be a barometer for creating a pecking order among conferences.
This can make a huge impact on the Pac-12’s national perception heading into next year, which can only help USC’s chances at a high preseason ranking for 2013. Should USC and the rest of the conference’s eight bowl teams post a 7-1 or perhaps even an 8-0 record, then the Pac-12 will be held in high regard going into next season.
Another positive side to playing the Sun Bowl is that it gives Lane an opportunity to use different players in live game action.
Though the team will be playing to win a victory in the Sun Bowl will do little to remove the stink that this season will leave behind. So why wouldn’t Lane take some chances with some different lineups?
Maybe some extra snaps for freshman wide receiver Nelson Agholor or even even sophomore wide receiver George Farmer will be in store. Additional carries for sophomore running back D.J. Morgan could be expected, as well.
On the other side of the ball, Monte could sub frequently throughout the game, particularly in the secondary, where USC will likely be replacing three starters next season. Maybe junior safeties Gerald Bowman or Demetrius Wright could see increased playing time.
Kiffin could use the bowl game as a sort of early audition for starting jobs next year, and possibly take a page out of Pete Carroll’s book and become a vocal advocate for constant competition, even he probably is already a vocal advocate of “constant competition” in practice or in seemingly meaningless bowl games.
Or maybe the team will simply be focused on waking up early enough for kickoff, or on getting back to Los Angeles in time to celebrate the New Year. It’s entirely possible that the players and coaches are just as deflated about this season’s disappointment as the fans.
But if they’re smart, they’ll take this game seriously. Because, as any Trojan fan is quick to remind you, next season is right around the corner.

With a 29-5 record on the season, the USC women’s volleyball team has orchestrated a near-flawless season. Stiff competition from Pac-12 rivals Stanford and UCLA notwithstanding, the five losses have merely served as blips on the radar for a club that has dominated opponents with 17 regular-season sweeps and two more in the first round of the playoffs.
Peaking · Senior opposite Katie Fuller helped USC make quick work of its first two tournament opponents, beating Fairfield and St. Mary’s. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
Now, having already expected to reach the semifinals, the Women of Troy set their sights on the big stage with the finals just around the corner.
The sixth-seeded Women of Troy head to Texas this week, set to face the unfamiliar Wichita State Shockers (24-9) on Friday night in the Austin Regional semifinal Round of 16.
“If you want to use a pun, it’s a shocker — but only to those who aren’t watching, as Wichita State is on a good run the last three weeks,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “If you look at the stats, they match up with us in every category. Their setter [Chelsey Feekin] is critical for them and is the coach on the floor for them.”
The Women of Troy made quick work of their first two playoff matches, easily dispatching Fairfield 3-0 in first round action (25-8, 25-11, 25-10) before fending off St. Mary’s 3-0 (28-26, 25-16, 25-19) in a much stiffer match. The victories catapulted the team to its fifth semifinal appearance in seven years and ninth overall in 12 years under Haley.
The first-round match against the Stags arguably showcased the team’s most consistent effort of the season, as the Women of Troy registered 47 kills for a .518 attacking percentage while logging nine aces. Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio christened her playoff career with a dominating performance, notching 16 kills. Senior opposite Katie Fuller and junior outside hitter Sara Shaw each recorded nine kills, while sophomore setter Hayley Crone notched 31 assists and junior libero Natalie Hagglund added 13 digs.
St. Mary’s proved to be a different story altogether for the Women of Troy, who promptly began the match with an extended set but put away the final two sets to advance. Junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard inflicted significant damage defensively, recording six solo blocks (and 10 total) to go alongside six kills. The six solo blocks were the highest for USC since Emily Adams also recorded six in a November 2002 game against Stanford.
The Women of Troy recorded a perfect first set with 18 kills and no errors, but still trailed 26-25. A quick Olgard kill and a crushing shot by Bricio brought up set point at 27-26. Olgard ended an expense by recording her third solo block of the frame to seal it at 28-26.
The second set, while still competitive, proved less tight than the first. After a back-and-forth battle early, the Women of Troy jumped up 20-15 on a kill by freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, after which an attacking error sealed the set at 25-16. The third set saw the Gaels keep pace, but the Women of Troy pushed out to leads of 19-12 and 23-16 before finishing the match on a Gael service error.
“We had three hard days of practice this week,” Haley said. “We’re not just focused on winning the match, but we are also trying to get better as well.”
While the Women of Troy have not played the Shockers this season and are relatively unfamiliar with the program, Haley placed particular emphasis on the need to respect any and all opponents in the playoffs.
“We want our players to respect their team and coaching staff,” Haley said. “Everyone who can get to the sweet 16 can win on any given night and they are playing with nothing to lose. WS plays in a good conference. They will be ready to play and we are not looking past Wichita State.”
The winner of the USC-Wichita State match will advance to the regional championship match Saturday against the winner of the Texas-Florida semifinal.

USC’s men’s basketball team dropped its second game against a ranked opponent on the road in three days, as the Trojans’ late rally fell short in a 75-67 loss to No. 18 New Mexico.
Steadying presence · On a USC men’s basketball team that entered Wednesday’s loss at New Mexico shooting 40 percent from the field, senior forward Eric Wise has been a bright spot, shooting 50.9 percent. – Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
All of USC’s starters scored in double digits, with senior forward Eric Wise leading the charge for the Trojans (3-5) with 14 points.
However, the bench contributed only seven points, and the team was outrebounded 29-23 by New Mexico (9-0).
After trailing by as much as 17 points in the second half, senior point guard Jio Fontan hit two free throws to cut the Lobos’ lead to 70-65 with 2:18 left.
But New Mexico guard Kendall Williams knocked down a 3-pointer on the next trip down the court to put the game out of reach.
After a lackluster offensive performance against Nebraska on Monday, USC came out firing on all cylinders against the Lobos, who entered the game as one of only 20 undefeated teams in the nation.
The Trojans made nine of their first 10 field goal attempts, including their first seven two-point shots, on their way to staking out a 28-18 lead.
But New Mexico dominated for the rest of the first half, claiming a 43-34 halftime lead on a 25-6 run led by guard Hugh Greenwood, who sank four three-pointers during the team’s hot streak.
Overall, the Lobos converted 11 of their 24 attempts from beyond the arc, led by Greenwood’s five treys and 17 points, a game high.
It marked the fourth consecutive game in which the Trojans have allowed an exorbitant number of 3-pointers by their opponents.
Five minutes into the second half, New Mexico forward Cameron Bairstow slammed home a dunk and forward Alex Kirk, who recorded a double-double with 13 points and 13 rebounds, followed up on the Lobos’ next possession with a trey to extend their advantage to 57-42.
That lead proved too much for the Trojans to whittle down completely.
There were some positives for USC to take from the loss, however; New Mexico had come into the game holding opponents’ shooting percentage under 40 percent, and the Trojans converted 52.9 percent of their chances from the floor — almost 13 percent better than the 40 percent field goal percentage they were collectively shooting entering the matchup.
Before Wednesday, the Lobos were second in the nation in free-throw attempts per game (29.6), but the Trojans only let them get to the charity stripe 14 times, where the Lobos converted eight of their free throws.
USC junior guard J.T. Terrell, who has proven to be a streaky shooter this season, made three of his five shots from beyond the arc to finish with 11 points, and junior forward Dewayne Dedmon showed off some impressive post moves while tallying 12 points and nine rebounds — arguably his best performance of the season to date.
Over winter break, the Trojans will wrap up their non-conference slate and also play the first four games of their conference schedule.
USC will only play one team that’s currently ranked over the next month, which comes in a matchup this Saturday at the Galen Center against No. 14 Minnesota.
The Trojans will also play home matches against UC-Riverside (Dec. 15), UC-Irvine (Dec. 20), Dayton (Dec. 30), Stanford (Jan. 3) and California (Jan. 15).
They’ll play road contests against Georgia (Dec. 22), Colorado (Jan. 10) and Utah (Jan. 12).

Los Angeles County announced Sunday that Measure J, a ballot proposition aiming to extend a half-cent sales tax benefiting transit projects until 2069, failed by only .56 percent.
Public transportation · Students felt the failure of Measure J, which would have extended a half-penny sales tax for Los Angeles Metro projects, will result in negative consequences for the city’s public transportation. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The half-cent sales tax will remain in effect until 2039 because voters passed Measure R in 2008. Measure J, the extension of Measure R, needed 14,000 more votes to pass and would have helped expedite transit construction projects, including the creation of subway lines that extend to Westwood and Santa Monica.
Tax measures require a two-thirds majority to pass, and only 66.1 percent of voters were in favor of extending the measure.
Had Measure J passed, Metro would have had the ability to borrow against expected future revenue and accelerate current projects implemented under Measure R. It also would have required Metro break ground on 15 major transit and freeway projects in five years rather than 20.
“Fewer projects will be constructed and completed in the next 20 years because potential borrowing is limited to the expected revenues from the existing Measure R, which expires in 2039,” Genevieve Giuliano, a professor in the School of Public Policy and the director of the METRANS Transportation Center said.
Lindsey Khim, a freshman majoring in policy, planning and development, said she wished the measure had passed because she believes the projects make transportation around the city more  convenient.
“I was so excited to come to school in L.A., but it’s so hard to get around,” Khim said. “I would have paid more taxes to extend the rail system.”
Current USC students and local residents, though, will not be directly affected as few projects would have been completed in the near future, Giuliano said.
“Still, residents of Los Angeles county in the 2020s and 2030s will have less public transit infrastructure than if Measure R had been extended,” he said.
Another proposed use of the extra revenue was to keep student fares on transit low.
“Even though the Metro is kind of limited, it’s a really easy, cheap way to get to places like L.A. Live,” Khim said. “Raising the fares a lot might make my friends and I look for other options.”
This might not be the last time voters see such a measure on the ballot. Metro released a statement Monday confirming they may pursue the measure in the future.
“Metro directors have the option of asking voters in the future if they wish to extend the program,” according to the statement.
In response to the election results, Metro said the organization is undeterred and will continue pursuing future projects.
“Nearly 2 million Los Angeles County residents, expressed confidence in Metro and the Measure R program,” according to Metro’s statement. “Progress will continue as Metro remains focused on delivering a dozen new transit projects.”
This is a well written piece. I love comparing your piece with our newspaper The bulldog bugle

Alex Fullman, a senior majoring in political science, was sitting in photography class when he received news that would change his life.
Scholar · Alex Fullman, a senior majoring in political science, will study law at the University of Oxford on a Marshall Scholarship grant. – Photo courtesy of Alex Fullman
“We were reviewing photos that day, and I have to admit that day I wasn’t paying very much attention to what was being said in class,” Fullman said. “Right when we were talking about my photos, that’s when they called me. It was terrible luck.”
Most would probably disagree, since the phone call Fullman received that day was to inform him that he had been awarded the Marshall Scholarship, a grant for American undergraduate students to pursue a graduate degree in the United Kingdom.
Fullman, who will attend the  University of Oxford in London next year, found out about the scholarship through the Office of Academic & International Fellowships. The staff at the office helped him with the process of getting endorsed by the university and submitting an application. Once Fullman was selected as a finalist, he completed an interview with the British Consulate. Less than a week later, on Nov. 13, Fullman found out he was a recipient.
“I don’t know that [attending graduate school in the United Kingdom] is something I would have done without the Marshall Scholarship,” Fullman said. “The opportunity to study at Oxford, which is really one of the world’s great universities, is extraordinary.”
The Marshall Scholarship was created by a 1953 act of the British Parliament in honor of United States Secretary of State George C. Marshall and his Marshall Plan, which helped rebuild Western Europe after World War II. The scholarship funds up to 40 high-achieving American students to study in the United Kingdom at the graduate level.
Fullman plans to pursue a master’s degree in philosophy in comparative government. He plans to focus his studies on campaign finance, a topic he also researched during his time as an undergraduate at USC.
“At Oxford, I’m hoping to take a comparative approach to campaign finance to see if different campaign finance systems have different impacts on various metrics, such as an anti-corruption and participation in government,” Fullman said.
Fullman, who has been to London three times, said he wanted to study in England because it is one of his favorite countries. He said that he’s most looking forward to immersing himself in university life, learning more about British culture and meeting his new classmates and the other scholarship recipients.
At USC, Fullman is the editor in chief of the USC Journal of Law and Society, president of the Blackstonians Pre-Law Honor Society, vice president for student life at USC Hillel and a student worker in the Office of the Provost.
After attaining his master’s degree, Fullman hopes to attend law school. Fullman said that his inspiration for studying law and government stems from his desire to contribute to equal rights.
“For me, equality is one of the great virtues of our society,” Fullman said. “Equality is one of the things that tie together a lot of the works that I’ve done. I hope to ultimately be in a position to promote equality, and I hope that studying at Oxford will set me on that path.”

Nearly 10 months after its debut, the LA Metro Expo Line attracts tens of thousands of boardings per day — a fact that is helped by being so close to USC, according to Metro.
Since its opening on April 28, the Expo Line has brought thousands of students and community members onto the Metro system. The 8.6 mile-long line serves riders from Culver City to Downtown Los Angeles, with three stops near USC.
The Expo Line ends at the 7th Street/Metro Center, which connects riders to Hollywood, Universal Studios, Chinatown, Pasadena and the Los Angeles International Airport.
This first phase cost around $930 million. Metro has budgeted $38.9 million for Expo Line operations for 2013.
Metro is “completely delighted” by the success of the Expo Line, according to Metro spokesperson Kim Upton, who said the line has exceeded their expectations.
“The line is much more popular than Metro imagined it would be,” Upton said.
Original projections for the year 2020 predicted 27,000 daily boardings on weekdays. Already, the line gets more than 22,000 boardings each day. Total Metro weekday boarding averages 360,901 times a day.
“LA is hungry for ways to get out of their cars and out of rush-hour traffic,” Upton said. “When we build something, they hop on.”
If the large rider numbers are any indication, Metro does not expect the line to slow down anytime soon.
“Daily boardings are growing at a steady clip,” Upton said. “We’re expecting it to grow, but we don’t know how much. It’s far beyond its original projections,”
One of the key points of the campaign for opening the line at USC was for transporting fans to Trojan football games. Many students have seen the packed trains on game days.
“My friend lives Downtown and he takes it for every game day, instead of taking a cab or driving,” said Maddie Lay, a senior majoring in political science.
On the first game day of the season, there were 8,000 more riders on the Expo Line than on an average day. The number of riders increased with each consecutive game, according to Upton.
By 2015, the Expo Line will expand to Santa Monica, a service many students said is much needed. Phase II will cost an estimated $1.5 billion. The line is currently being built by BuildExpo, an independent company that is funded by Metro that turns the line back over to Metro once it is ready to run. Major construction on the line began last summer.
BuildExpo expects the commute from Downtown L.A. to Santa Monica on the Expo Line will take around 46 minutes, even during rush hour.
After the completion of the extension, BuildExpo predicts ridership will grow to 64,000 daily passengers by 2030. If these projections hold true, the Expo Line would be one of the most heavily used light rail lines in the country.
“I’ve taken the bus to Santa Monica, and it took about an hour and a half. Being able to get there more quickly will be really nice for students,” said Hannah Kim, a junior majoring in costume design.
Other students agreed, saying they would appreciate a faster route to Santa Monica.
“I think it would be life-changing. Once you get there, you can go so many other places,” Lay said.
Several stations have also been upgraded for Metro’s TAP program since the line first opened in April. TAP is a reusable, reloadable plastic charge card for Metro funds. Passengers currently have the option of using either paper tickets or TAP cards, but Metro has begun phasing out the paper tickets.
Indoor stops will also soon begin to use a locking gate system, where users must scan their TAP card in order to enter the station.
Though this will not be an issue for the USC stops, users will still need to use a TAP card and present it when they enter other stations.
Despite the new line and marketing efforts made by Metro, some students said they still stick to using cars. Many don’t know where the Expo Line goes, or if those places are worth their time.
“What is even in Century City?” Wesley Adams, a senior majoring in communications, responded when asked if he would take the Expo Line.
Kim said she understands why so many students choose to skip taking the bus or train.
“Coming from a town without public transportation, I would never have considered taking the bus,” Kim said. “A lot of people don’t consider it, they just think of it as a car town.”
This would be too easy of a Trojan joke to make, but December minus April is almost 8 months, not 10. Good guess though! :)

Students order food from the Gravy Truck in Alumni Park on Thursday as part of the annual “USC Food Truck War,” hosted by the USC Interfraternity and Panhellenic Council. The proceeds from the event, which lasted from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., benefit Troy Camp.

I can’t see the whole picture, but it definitely looks like that is the Gravy Train, or at least the Gravy “Tra,” not the Gravy Truck.

USC Information Technology Services is working to solve a hardware problem that has affected the USC Wireless and USC Wireless Plus networks since Tuesday.
Technicians have confirmed the problem is related to the network’s hardware, but the cause of the issue is still unknown, according to Kevin Durkin, director of communications and marketing for ITS.
“Since we haven’t fully diagnosed the issue, we have no timeline on when it will be fixed,” Durkin said.
Durkin noted that the wired Internet network has been unaffected by the glitch.
Chris Amezcua, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the problems with the Internet have made completing the final assignments of the semester extremely difficult.
“Everyone has papers due and especially research papers, which you need the Internet for,” he said. “It’s crunch time right before finals, so it’s the worst timing possible.”
Since the technical difficulties with the wireless networks began, Amezcua has been using an Ethernet cable to complete his assignments.
According to Robert Hernandez, an assistant professor of professional practice at USC Annenberg, the issues with USC’s wireless networks have disrupted his lesson plans and impacted his students’ final projects.
“We are a digital class. Most of us are very dependent on Wi-Fi. We are starting to code, so technology and, of course, Wi-Fi, is the backbone of this class,” Hernandez said. “When something like this goes down, it really is crippling, not just for my class, but for everyone. You don’t have to be a digital journalism professor like I am to be affected.”
Durkin said ITS plans to send out a notification when the problems with the wireless network are fixed. The ITS website is also being updated as technicians learn more about the issue.
Katherine Sun, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the problems with the Internet have forced her to look for other ways to get online.
“I’m thinking about going to Starbucks off campus to complete my homework,” Sun said. “It’s a very inconvenient time for this. I can’t believe this happened during finals.”

well at least we watch some descent porn not the filthy animal porn you watch!!!
I beg to differ.  I have a number of cats and I can assure you no sex of any kind is watched on my computer or goes on at my abode.   Keep your filthy thoughts to yourself!
It’s all you kids and the porn you download that crashes the system
Yeah a school which spends millions if not billions on construction and beautification of campus has such a bad internet connection. And its year long. Please ITS, you cant give a timeline. Shut ITS and impeach the President of the university and hire a third party consultant who can easily manage this 1000 times better. USC needs to set it priorities straight!!! enough with construction and athletes… start focusing on the real business.
The wireless connection in off-campus apartments (I live at Hillview) is atrocious all year long. My roommate and I often stay late hours on campus just because we know the connection will be terrible at home. Whenever I contact ITS or Housing they say there is no solution. So much for the 21st-century high-tech USC. It’s very frustrating, probably my #1 complaint about USC right now.

Why am I still single?”
How many times have you asked yourself that question? How many times have you found yourself sitting on your bed watching an old episode of Bones while stuffing Oreos into your mouth and wondering why you’re alone?
Oh, is that just me? OK, then.
Or, how about when you’re sitting on campus and you run into your crush? Only he’s not alone — he’s with some chick who wears light-wash bell-bottomed jeans with running sneakers? Really? She’s the one with the boyfriend?
After all, if Honey Boo Boo’s mom could somehow find lasting love, what the hell is the matter with you?
Well, what have we learned in the last three months, “Lovegame” readers? I’ve tried to teach you the ins and outs of hooking up with friends, one night stands, heartbreaking rejection, flirtatious texting and more, and yet it feels like it hasn’t been enough. You’re still single, so where do we go from here?
Let’s break it down. If you’re still single (and looking), then it could be because of a multitude of reasons: A) You want it too much, B) Your past relationships have ruined you, C) You flirt horribly or D) You can’t see what’s in front of you.
We’ll start with A. And as we start, we’re going to make a promise to be honest with each other and with ourselves: We want it too much. We want the fireworks, we want the butterflies and we want the late-night cuddle sessions. Every time we see our best friend change their profile picture to a photo of them with their beau ice-skating, you want to punch them in the face  — and then promptly cry to yourself because you want that so badly.
You need to take a chill pill here, kiddos. Stop wasting your time thinking about hypotheticals, lusting after those who don’t lust after you and embarrassing yourself to get attention when you’re at parties. Take a step back, live your life and let love come to you.
I know this might be hard, especially if you’ve had particularly crappy relationships in the past, which brings us to B. Toxic situations have a penchant for completely ruining our visions of love for the future, and we need to detox ourselves of that poison. Get that image of that loser ex-boyfriend or your crazy ex-girlfriend out of your head. Forget about the one who got away.
You need to wash yourselves of the past to move on. If you keep bringing the darkness back into your life, you’re just sabotaging yourself. Every hookup and relationship is different, and you have to treat it as such.
But let’s be real here: if you’ve been in toxic hookup situations and relationships, chances are your flirting skills have taken a hard hit. I have a friend who was in a relationship for years before calling it quits this semester, and their flirting skills — or lack thereof — certainly reflect that. People ask me how to flirt and honestly, there’s no one true answer. Sure you can be a cute texter and say all the right things, but nothing can fake true chemistry.
When it’s right, you’ll suddenly turn into Casanova, trust me. You don’t need to force anything, or else your inadequacies will be cast into the open. Be yourself, and you’ll attract the right person. And unless you’re planning on murdering someone, no rules (even mine) apply in the dating game. I’m just a 20-year-old girl. You could follow my advice to the T, or you could be out there in world, living your life.
Which brings us to point D. Look around. Are you sure your potential beau isn’t right in front of you? You might be so busy that you’re shutting yourself off from the person you’re meant to be with. Open your eyes to new types of people. If you only like to date athletes (good luck with that one) then try saying yes to a date with that cutie from your science lecture. Don’t have expectations, and don’t have a checklist of qualities that you want your love to have.
But to be perfectly honest, you’re probably still single because it’s just not your time yet. As hackneyed as it might sound, I truly do believe that we all have soul mates out there waiting for us. And when the time is right, we’ll run into them. People often ask me when you know that this is “it,” and I always respond, “You just know.” You feel a jolt in your bones every time they accidentally brush up against you. You fall asleep to dreams about their eyes. The sound of their voice makes your heart do somersaults in your chest. You can’t get them out of your head even though you’ve spent months convincing yourself that you don’t need them.
Now that’s something that you can’t force. That sort of attraction and love is something that you can’t rush. It’s something that you can’t seek. You’re single because you’re supposed to be single right now. You’re single because it’s not your time yet.
Accept that fact and you will feel a weight lifted off of your shoulders. Be happy with yourself, be happy with who you are and start to live in the present. Don’t waste your remaining days here crying over your hypothetical soulmate. You two will find each other, but in the mean time, have a little fun. Go to a random party. Say yes to every date you get asked out on (come on, a free meal is so worth awful conversation). Open your heart and open your mind to a world of possibility.
Keep your chin up. Even though I might not know you, I know that you are a fabulous, strong, beautiful, funny, smart person. And someone else will see that someday.
One day you’ll be like all those other sickening couples. One day you’ll get someone to give you a massage after a long day of class. One day you’ll have someone who’ll make you cookies. One day.

Or how about E) You’re fat and ugly. If you’re an ugly female and single, perhaps your only option is getting plastic surgery. Dr. Song hae Kim is good. I will redirect you to Dr. Kim. 9201 Sunset Boulevard West Hollywood.
Mawkish sentimentality. I don’t know why you felt compelled to write something this trite, but it’s honestly an embarrassment to the school and to yourself- was enforcing stereotypes on every conceivable level your goal? The fact of the matter is that long-lasting relationships are at an all time low and that the digital age is superficially bringing us all closer together while simultaneously making it more and more difficulty for humans to be intimately in touch with one another- no amount of flirtatious texts is going to change that..
I wish you luck- maybe someday you’ll find a man with flawless texts who will give you freshly baked cookie massages as you ice-skate together- these superficialities are truly the key to your happiness. 
-A Fabulous, strong, beautiful, funny and smart person..(could I be your Mr. Perfect?)
I may not be Mr. Right but I am certainly Mr. Right Now!  Text me for a HU
Remember to put out or you are just a “tease.”  Guys don’t like “teases.”

As we make our way into this holiday season, the same question remains on everyone’s mind: “What do I buy my friends and family for Christmas?”
Stocking stuffers · These miniature plushies, found at the USC Bookstore, make great stocking stuffers or gifts for stuffed animal lovers. – Caitlin Ito | Daily Trojan
For many college students, life is always in the fast lane, always on the go and always on a budget. So what can they do? Where can they go to buy quick, easy and affordable gifts for our loved ones?
The answer is simple: the beloved USC Bookstore.
The on-campus bookstore has four floors packed with potential gifts for friends and family members of all ages and all walks of life, from Mom and Dad to best friends to significant others.
For Mom and Dad, some brand new Trojan gear makes a great gift. The bookstore offers stylish USC Dad coffee mugs for the reasonable price of $5.95. To match, the store sells USC Mom decals for the car, also $5.95.
If your parents enjoy wining and dining, browse the bookstore’s affordable gifts for the kitchen. The bookstore sells USC potholders for only $8.95 each — the perfect compliment to a warm, home-cooked meal in the wintertime. In addition, USC vintage wine stoppers and cardinal music bottle openers are on sale for affordable prices for those interested in pairing their meals with a beverage.
Other family-friendly gifts include a variety of festive and fun wall calendars, such as the popular 2013 Trojan football calendar, for a price of $15.99.
For those trying to find gifts for friends, the bookstore also has an array of options, from Trojan gear to books to accessories. For example, the store sells winter apparel such as USC beanies or the ever-popular USC Potter scarf, each gift priced under $20.
If your friends are fans of stuffed animals, the bookstore has added three new plush hits to their collection. Customers can now buy the cute and cuddly USC round cub for only $15. The bookstore also sells “I Heart USC” stuffed letters for a fairly affordable price of $19.95. If this price is a little out of reach, customers also have the option of buying the smaller USC stuffed letters for only $8.95.
When shopping for diehard Trojan football fans, consider gifts that showcase pride in our football team and our Trojan spirit. A USC foam sword only costs $6.95 or foam fingers $7.95. Or feel free to go all out and purchase a Trojan fuzzy football for $19.95.
The bookstore also offers a variety of small stocking stuffers. Customers can find products such as the USC Sock Monkey keychain, USC Hello Kitty plush toys, mini rubber basketballs, “I Heart USC” bracelets and classic USC pom-poms. The bookstore even carries a Traveler baby rattle so the little ones can have a special Christmas gift.
All the Trojan spirit too much for you? The bookstore offers a variety of gift options that do not sport cardinal and gold. These choices include best-selling books like J.K. Rowling’s The Casual Vacancy, day planners for 2013, journals and sketchbooks. For the fashionistas in your life, make-up and accessories like sunglasses and scarves can be found on the ground floor.
For those who have the luxury of spending a bit more on gifts, try making fun and innovative gift combinations to give to your family and friends. For example, you could create a “Trojan Spirit” gift package, featuring a foam sword, a USC bracelet and a set of pom-poms. Other combinations can include a new book and a journal for literature-loving friends or a matching beanie and scarf for friends who live in cold weather.
But no matter who you are shopping for this holiday season, everyone appreciates a homemade Christmas or holiday card. The top floor of the bookstore has all the art supplies needed to make Christmas cards on a budget. Whether students are looking for construction paper, crayons, colored pencils, markers or envelopes, the bookstore is the place to go for your various card supplies. Or, if you want to get a little fancy and show off your crafting skills, the bookstore also sells a variety of paints and paintbrushes that anyone could use to spice up their holiday notes.
With all of the options offered at the bookstore, it’s easy to worry about travelling with newly purchased gifts. But the USC Bookstore allows customers to order online and have their gift items shipped to their homes, a valuable offer for those who might be traveling outside of Southern California.
From shopping for fellow Trojans to family members and friends, USC students have an advantage for giving creative, fun gifts that are sure to be a hit. So before you head over to a major department store or log on to Amazon.com, consider the USC Bookstore’s wide selection of potential presents. After all, these Trojan-themed items are sure to add a little cardinal and gold to the holiday spirit.

With finals fast approaching, the scramble to find quiet places to study, on and off campus, begins as well. For students looking for a new place to study that is outside USC’s bubble and can offer a quiet, cozy place to study for hours at a time, the numerous cafes scattered throughout Koreatown offer many worthy havens.
Serene studying · Koreatown’s Yellow House Cafe is one of the neighborhood’s many coffee and pastry spots also offering outdoor oasis ideal for studying. Yellow House also serves entrees like kimchi fried rice. – Kristal Ha | Daily Trojan
Yellow House Cafe 
234 S. Oxford Ave.
Yellow House Cafe features one of the best aspects of cafes in Koreatown: charming, cozy outdoor study spaces, complete with miniature fountains, vine-covered arbors, potted plants squeezed into any open space and Christmas lights that twinkle during the evening.
Yellow House is perfect for daytime study sessions with some fresh air and a warm drink on hand. There don’t seem to be power outlets anywhere, so bring the hundreds of pages of reading you still need to catch up on instead of the laptop.
What makes Yellow House a standout is its food menu, which features a small assortment of foods to stave off hunger, from fusion tacos to kimchi fried rice.
The drinks menu is standard: coffee-based drinks, teas and lemonades. If ordering iced tea at Yellow House, be warned: your tea bag will be placed in cold, iced water and then served to you. So unless you like barely-there flavor, order it hot and wait for it to cool down.
Yellow House, however, goes above and beyond in presentation when compared to other cafes. Entrees are colorful and laid out nicely on your plate, and iced teas come in a white satchel. And if you’re looking for an especially Instagram-worthy drink, the rose iced tea has little rosebuds floating on top.
Coffee House Heyri
755 S. Hobart Blvd.
Heyri is the quietest of the featured cafes, with high school students bent over their books and middle-aged men and women quietly chatting while sipping on coffee.
The interior of Heyri has an English library feel, with stained glass lamps and dark walls. The exterior is very similar to Yellow House: plants everywhere, Christmas lights draped overhead and a small fountain set-up in the center. While it looks nice during the day, it is at night when Heyri is at its most festive.
Like the majority of Koreatown cafes, desserts are hit or miss. If tempted to order, stick with the chocolate-based desserts, as those are generally more flavorful.
Additionally, small amenities, like complimentary blankets for chilly nights, make Heyri a relaxing place to study and enjoy a more peaceful side of Los Angeles.
IOTA Coffee & Bakery
528 S. Western Ave.
Large, spacious and with a contemporary feel, Iota is different from the majority of Korean cafes. Instead, the coffee and bakery feels more like a restaurant, with larger tables in one expansive room. Though there is outdoor seating, the view of Western Avenue — with tiny stores and no vegetation in sight — is less than pleasing, so try to get a table inside.
Though Iota might not have the best views, it does have satisfying coffee as well as a large assortment of refreshing iced drinks (and yes, you can add boba to them). The milk tea is rich and flavorful, and the iced drinks, as well as the teas, are more flavorful and satisfying than the coffee, in general.
Iota features the best dessert menu out of all of the cafes listed, so if you’re looking to satisfy a sweet tooth, this is the place to go. The desserts are decadent and the right size to split with someone if you want to avoid the calorie guilt later on.
What makes Iota really special, however, are its hours. Open until midnight Monday through Wednesday, and until 2 a.m. Thursday through Saturday, Iota is a great option for late-night study sessions. It is best suited for study groups, since the Top 40 hits played inside can be distracting for students doing Calculus problem sets, and are better geared for sessions with talking and collaboration.
While Koreatown is known to students for its numerous Korean BBQ restaurants (and little else), these cafes offer a way to explore a side of the neighborhood that is still mostly frequented by locals only.

Sometimes films that employ hyper-realism speak louder truths about life than any purely realist work.
This is the case with Jacques Audiard’s newest drama, Rust and Bone. A precise mix of surrealism and genuine narrative intensifies every moment of the film, amplifying its emotional effectiveness.
Foreign forte · Rust and Bone, directed by Jacques Audiard, employs an unusual plot structure to weave a tragic but redemptive love story. Strong acting, stunning imagery and an enchanting musical score carry the film. – | Photo by Roger Arpajou, courtesy of Sony Pictures Classic
The plot of this French and Belgian film, loosely based on Craig Davidson’s short story collection of the same name, breaks quite strongly from romantic tradition. Audiard writes the film in such a way that the romance avoids the cliches of onscreen love.
The title characters, Stephanie (Marion Cotillard) and Ali (Matthias Schoenaerts), meet each other one ordinary night after an altercation at a nightclub. After this brief encounter, the two separate, each struggling to overcome the hardships weighing down their own lives. Though fighting for emotional survival, Stephanie and Ali meet again and find strength in their unlikely bond amid harrowing endeavors.
Audiard and his screenwriting partner, Thomas Bidegain, present a vivid definition of Ali within the very first minutes of film; the audience soon recognizes he is horribly selfish and a terrible guardian to his new responsibility, a young son. The writing pair prescribes a similarly detailed characterization to Stephanie, illustrating her character as care-free and provocative. Following a catastrophe that causes the loss of both her legs, Stephanie attempts to piece together the fragments of her previous lifestyle through a fascinating progression of personal triumph. Ali, on the other hand, experiences a growth and improvement of personality rather than a return to normalcy. The parallel narration of these two character arcs compels the audience, engrossing them in a visceral emotional experience often absent in theaters today.
Excellent performances from both lead actors further ground Audiard’s melodrama. Each provides incredibly real and intricate portrayals despite having no literary background information to draw from (surprisingly their two characters were never featured in the Davidson collection). The two European-born actors play off each other’s dialogue and actions almost flawlessly, and also communicate to the audience a deep understanding of their counterpart through emotive facial expressions and body language.
Cotillard especially infuses Stephanie with an unvarnished emotion and deep complexity that reveals her character’s adversity. Her performance remains transcendent, more truthful than cinematic, and Cotillard again demonstrates that she is one of premier actresses working today.
Likewise, Schoenaerts delivers the character of Ali with a very keen precision. He’s nasty and selfish, yet Schoenaerts consistently alludes to his character’s slight capacity for care and kindness.
Though a marvel of brilliant acting, Rust and Bone is a visual pleasure, as well. Paired with a superb score by Alexandre Desplat are arresting expressionist visuals, every frame a piece of crisp, visible poetry that sharpens any emotional cue.
Rust and Bone’s most obvious fault, ironically, lies in one of its most favorable traits: the complex, untraditional storyline. For the most part, the incoherence is a positive attribute, adding to the stylized, more true-to-life portrayal of love. Nevertheless, it seems the filmmakers might have been a little too self-indulgent, veering the story into unnecessary subplots. Still, though, the transition between the ambiguous latter acts is improperly handled, the ending is heart-wrenching, concluding the film in a monumental manner.
Director Jacques Audiard’s follow-up to the Oscar-nominated A Prophet is an enthralling departure from the traditional Hollywood romance. Built upon fierce performances, an acute musical sense and striking imagery, Rust and Bone holds its own as one of this year’s best foreign films.
I like this style of romance………………………….

It’s been a busy semester, although hectic might be a more appropriate word.
Quite frankly, much of what we cover at the Daily Trojan can be fairly routine. We’re a hyper-local publication that focuses on the USC community; as a result, we don’t always have the sexiest storylines. It’s easy to get lost in the day-to-day, to just keep feeding the beast we call the print news cycle.
This semester had the DT staff busy, though. There was the unfortunate Halloween shooting; there was the 2012 election, in which President Barack Obama secured a second term; there was the DT’s 100th anniversary; there were the football games, which featured everything from deflated footballs to deflated championship hopes to record-breaking performances; there was the men’s water polo’s fifth straight NCAA championship; and of course, between the highlights and lowlights, there was a flurry of slow news days.
In my first editorial, at the beginning of the semester, I wrote about USC’s community garden, about how it was our goal here at the DT to cover everything USC-related to the best of our abilities, so we could do you — the students, parents faculty, staff and alumni — justice.
We’ve always tried to do direct reporting and be on top of the news, but, as with everything, we had hurdles to overcome. I’m sure we printed some things you didn’t like. Maybe we were slow to the punch. But at the end of the semester, I can proudly say we worked our hardest to support and inform the USC community.
The DT staffers were the dedicated editors, photographers, designers and reporters on campus this semester. We had something to say, and, consequently, something for you to read. We did our best to keep you in the USC loop, to facilitate discussion on campus, to keep you updated on social media with live updates — and we even managed to pen some sexy storylines.
The DT will always be the sounding board for the USC community, no matter who’s on staff and no matter who’s in charge — which brings me to my next point.
As is tradition, the DT will be changing its editorial board and staff at the close of the semester — this includes every position from news editor to editor in chief.
Eddie Kim, who many of you might already be familiar with through his writing or his participation on staff, has been elected by the DT staff to be the spring 2013 editor in chief. And Thursday afternoon, the student media board will hold a formal meeting to review and appoint the editor-elect.
Eddie has written for the DT since he was a freshman at Annenberg. And not only is he one of my best friends, he’s one of my brightest and most talented colleagues. I have absolute faith he will lead his team of editors to a successful semester of USC news coverage.
The next print edition is scheduled for Jan. 15, and in the meantime, important developments will be posted on the DT’s website and broadcast through social media.
With that being said, continue to hold the DT accountable. Keep the conversation going, because, as the university’s newspaper, we depend on you, our readers.
To the USC community members that direct messaged us on Twitter, messaged us on Facebook and dropped by the newsroom, please keep doing so. Whether it’s story ideas, questions or complaints, you keep us going.
We’ve been doing this for 100 years, one semester — and counting. And I can tell you we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon.

In 1989, five 14-to 15-year-old boys, four black and one Hispanic, were convicted of a crime they did not commit. They spent between five and  11 years in juvenile delinquent centers and prisons in New York. Though the boys were victims of institutional racism and a flawed justice system that robbed them of a significant portion of their youth, none of them wasted their time behind bars. Though their imprisonment interrupted their high school careers, each one of them took and passed the General Education Development Test while incarcerated.
Kate Wong | Daily Trojan
A documentary co-directed by Ken Burns that opened in Los Angeles last week, the Central Park Five (which the media infamously dubbed the group) tells the story of these boys’ incarceration and eventual acquittal. Though I strongly recommend seeing the film for many reasons, from its accurate portrayal of a deeply flawed American justice system, news media and society to amazing footage and interviews, the fact that all five got their GEDs in prison should remind us of the powerful role that correctional education plays in prison reform.
The prison system remains a widespread, deep problem in the United States. And though California is especially known for incarceration issues — overcrowding, abuses, inefficient prisons and more — the state is beginning to spearhead a prison reform trend. Last year, Gov. Jerry Brown signed his realignment plan into law, moving thousands of inmates from state prison to county jails with a dual goal of saving the state money and relieving overcrowding by redirecting lower-level offenders to local authorities who can better handle them. This year, in the 2012 election, Californians voted by a wide margin to reform the state’s three-strikes law, making it so not any individual convicted of his or her third felony would automatically receive a life sentence, but, instead, only if the individual committed a serious or violent crime.
Both of these historic changes indicate a shift in how Californians perceive and want criminal justice to be handled by the government. And both measures have made significant differences already — there have been drops in the number of offenders, crowding reductions and billions of dollars saved — but the struggle to reform our prisons still needs to go deeper.
According to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 95 percent of California state prison inmates will be released to society. And the average offender in California reads at an eighth-grade level. Such a low reading level likely means that once released, offenders will be unable to secure anything but an extremely low-level, low-paying, low-reward job, which in turn makes it much more likely for them to re-offend and be sent back to prison.
There’s something wrong with this picture. It is a cyclical problem that California, as a state poised to lead a growing trend, must break with by making correctional education a bigger part of the prison reform movement.
California prisons do offer amazing education programs — 32 out of 33 CDCR institutions are fully accredited schools that offer vocational training, English as a second language courses and the option to obtain high school diplomas and GED certificates. Such programs are essential to easing individuals back into society and providing them with the tools that will prevent them from becoming repeat offenders.
Obviously, opposition for correctional education is strong. Why provide criminals with the right to education? This kind of thinking is understandable, but has no place in a state where prisons are overcrowded and suck money from the state. Correctional education is one of the best ways to get at the root of the state’s prison problem, which arguably begins and ends with education. According to a 2010 study conducted by The Foundation for Educational Choice, more than 50 percent of all U.S. inmates are high school dropouts.
Education — or lack thereof — might not be the direct reason many individuals end up in prison, but more likely than not, it played some part in it. Because of this, Brown should not only continue to support correctional education, but also make it a central focus of his efforts to reform California prisons.

Great article. Clearly we are unnecessarily incarcerating our fellow citizens.
You should also look into how minority citizens are being sentenced to state prison in comparison to anglo’s charged with the exact same crimes being sentenced to probation.
[…] what about improving the quality of rehabilitation received by inmates to include education in prison reform? According to the CDCR (California Department of Correction and Rehabilitation), 95% of […]
