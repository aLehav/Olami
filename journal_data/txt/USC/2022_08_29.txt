Happy fall semester everyone! Whether this is your first or last fall at USC, make sure to enjoy it to the fullest.
Although this inaugurates my fourth and final year here, I still can’t enter the right mindset for school. It seems that after spending the entire summer lazing around playing video games, I have grown too soft and spoiled to hit the ground running. As such, while I will do my best to deliver top-notch commentary, please forgive me if these first columns have one or two rushed transitions. Unlike what long-time readers may tell you, they are an anomaly and absolutely not a long-running tradition in this column. No, no need to check. 
Still, it’s not like I threw all my business standards out the window once summer started. Even though I barely left my bed in all those months, I still kept an eye on what was happening in the professional gaming scene. And while I’d love to be called a “dedicated columnist,” it’s mostly because EVO 2022 was going on.
For those of you who don’t know what EVO is, let me explain. Evolution Championship Series is one of the largest fighting game tournaments in the entire world. Featuring a roster of the year’s most popular games, together with some fan favorites, the event is usually a great showcase of the very best that the fighting game community has to offer. 
This year was no exception, and every single game featured incredible matches. We had the spectacle that was pro-player SonicFox winning the Skullgirls championship and canonizing themselves as one of the best fighting game athletes in the world. We also had the thrilling Tekken 7 matches, where the game’s highly advanced technical elements were once again pushed to the limit as long-time player Knee secured his third EVO win. But for me, the game that shined the brightest this year was Guilty Gear Strive, the newest addition to the famous Arc-System Works series of the same name.
Now, full disclosure, Strive is the only game that was featured in EVO that I actively play. But, even without much knowledge, it isn’t hard to see exactly why the game took center stage in the competition. Mixing a low entry barrier with a high-skill ceiling, Strive creates an environment that welcomes casual and pro-players alike. Not only that, but with its colorful cast of characters with charming moves and specials, the game is outright fun to watch, even with zero understanding of its inner workings.
Yet, what made it stand out to me didn’t have anything to do with the game itself. No, Strive was one of the best games in EVO because of its amazing players. Featuring a roster of players from all over the world, the athletes on the stage were filled with personality and incredible skill. The matches were incredibly close, and every minute was filled with tension and anxiety as the top players went head to head. In the end, pro-player Umisho took the trophy home after an incredible grand final, becoming the first ever Guilty Gear Strive EVO champion. 
But why am I talking about this now?
Well, usually I try to use something that happened — especially a failure — as a learning experience for the rest of the esports industry. Sometimes I go the other direction, showcasing something positive and drawing wider conclusions from that. In other words, I use something that happened as a jumping point to a possible, better future. This time, it’s neither here nor there. No, the reason why I chose specifically to talk about the Guilty Gear Strive EVO 2022 championship is that it shows, in purely realistic terms, how a tournament should be held.
I know that some readers may be scratching their heads since I’ve been building up this tournament as a perfect championship. In many ways it was, but perfect does not mean that it didn’t face any setbacks. And when we’re talking about the Strive EVO 2022 championship, there were almost too many setbacks to count. Take for example the time an avid fan distracted an athlete mid-match with their incessant screaming, requiring the pro-gamer to directly confront him, or the fact that the championship itself ran almost two hours late, resulting in the grand finals being held in the early hours of the morning. These errors, both of which could lead to a disastrous performance by the main athletes, are incredibly hard to recover from, and a disorganized tournament could lead to a fatal end.
And yet, this was not the case for EVO. Even as the hours dragged on and production lost their tight grip on the show, all the different components of the tournament still came together to deliver the best show they could. Staff and commentators put up incredible levels of energy to keep the hype going within the audience. The viewers, on their end, also cheered on the gamers with all their hearts, directly interacting with them after every win and loss in typical fighting game fashion. And of course, the athletes themselves pulled through all their fatigue to deliver the show of their lifetimes. 
While I love to talk about what ideally should happen, we now have a tangible and concrete example of how to run a perfect esports tournament even when everything seems to be falling apart. And while all some readers may take from this is to “power through,” the real reason why Strive’s EVO run didn’t end up in complete disaster has nothing to do with endurance, but rather the dedication and support that each component gave to one another. For a couple of brief hours, everyone in the venue came together in their hopes of striving to hold the best tournament they could, creating the perfect homage to the game – even if just in name.

As USC begins classes for the Fall 2022 semester, students, professors and administration alike are keeping close eyes on two things: coronavirus case counts and where, physically, their classes are being held — in person, remote or both. 
Professors are taking what they have learned in the past two years of teaching online and applying it to a new era of learning at USC — one where some individual professors have elected to hold classes online or in a hybrid environment as their concerns surrounding coronavirus remain. 
Guilan Siassi, an associate teaching professor of French, is holding her classes this semester in person but has a hybrid option — what she calls “hy-flex” — running during every class. With “hy-flex,” students can join a Zoom call where they can see both a view of the classroom and a view of whatever Siassi is screen-sharing. The classroom camera is equipped with a microphone and speakers so that students participating via “hy-flex” can both hear and speak to the class without feeling bad for not being physically present.
“I don’t want sick students coming to class because they don’t want to miss out on participation,” Siassi said.
Joe Saltzman, a professor of journalism and communication, has taken things one step further: his classes are fully on Zoom. The reason for this is not necessarily coronavirus — but it certainly helps, he said. 
When Saltzman moved his class — “Culture of Journalism: Past, Present and Future” — to an online format during virtual learning last year, he found that the format of teaching online for this particular class worked better than in-person learning. For a large, historical lecture-with-media class such as Saltzman’s, he realized that having students sit in “cramped auditorium seats” for the entire two-plus hour course was “not an effective way of teaching.” In a lecture hall, the professor and the students are far apart and, for those in the back, the screen is too small and far away to clearly see what the professor is presenting. 
“Now online, the student can watch the entire PowerPoint presentation and video on the screen and see it clearly,” Saltzman said. “They can also review that same recording as many times as they wish to find things that they missed the first time, and they can get up and stretch.” 
There are, however, often challenges with Zoom. Siassi, for example, recalled how she lost 20 minutes of class time to a video that refused to play for those on the Zoom, requiring her to disconnect and reconnect the call. 
Saltzman, on another hand, said he is worried about potential disruptions to his online class that are out of his control such as problems with his electricity and Wi-Fi. 
“We just had a blackout this morning here,” he said. “My genuine fear is what if I have a blackout right during my class? How am I going to recover? How am I going to get that time back?”
Unlike Siassi and Saltzman, most professors at USC this semester are teaching entirely in person, with no hybrid — or “hy-flex” — options for students. 
Rachel Newman, a PhD student at USC and assistant lecturer in Thematic Option, teaches  “Writing Seminar I” entirely in-person — with no hybrid option. 
“Last year, [I] had a bunch of tech issues … when I tried to do hybrid — having students in the class and students on Zoom — and it was very stressful for me as an instructor,” Newman said.
As for how they feel USC has handled coming back in person, professors have mixed reviews. 
“One thing I love about USC,” Saltzman said, is that “they’re very transparent.” 
He said he appreciates the daily coronavirus emails which tell him how many coronavirus cases there are on campus, as well as where each person who tested positive has been, especially because, he remarked, this is something the administration could easily not share.
“You don’t have to reveal this kind of stuff to everybody,” Saltzman said. “Prior administrations would not have revealed this. Carol’s administration — I love that part of it.” 
Newman, on another note, said she is nervous that the lack of masking and testing requirements may cause trouble at the University. 
“The problem with not requiring testing is that there could be so many more cases than we’re aware [of]… the only cases we’re gonna find out about are symptomatic cases where someone is actually ill, and as we’ve seen with COVID, a lot of people can have it and be asymptomatic,” Newman said.
Hagit Arieli-Chai, a Hebrew language coordinator and lecturer, noted that “fall [semester] in general has a larger amount of students” and, given the small classrooms around the University, may have liked to see USC implement a hybrid model for at least the beginning of the semester to facilitate a slower transition to in-person learning. 
Students such as William Baharian, a freshman studying applied and computational mathematics, have mixed feelings about the jump to in-person learning this semester. Baharian has most of his classes in person, yet one is temporarily online due to a coronavirus exposure within the group. While he said he hopes that this class will return to in-person learning in the coming week, he said he believes that the class can function online rather well. 
“Zoom,” Baharian said, “it’s not optimal, but you can still have good discussions… and most of the work for the class is already being done on a computer.”
Vaughn Hays, a freshman majoring in applied and computational mathematics, has all of his classes in person, but some include a Zoom option for those who need it. At the moment, Hays is one of those students — he is in quarantine at a hotel.  
Most of Hays’ classes with a Zoom option, however, are rather different from the “hy-flex” classes taught by Siassi. Hays said that he often feels like a spectator of the class.
“I’m not struck with the feeling that there’s good infrastructure to go full virtual for a class that started this year not being full virtual,” he said. 
Students also had mixed reviews as to the University’s return to in-person learning. 
“I think USC as a whole is doing a fairly good job,” Baharian said. He would, however, have liked to have seen a mask mandate in place. “I don’t think [coronavirus cases] can be completely avoided, but we could have mitigated some of the increases.”
Justin Bai, a junior majoring in computer science, doesn’t have “too much of” an issue with returning in person. 
“USC handled [the coronavirus] the same way as every other university has done it,” he said. “To my knowledge, I don’t think there’s any other university that still has indoor mask mandates or weekly testing.” While Bai seconded wanting a mask mandate, specifically indoors, he acknowledged that at this point, “USC is just doing what the majority of people want.”

In one academic year, five graduate students at the Price School of Public Policy increased funding for Educating Students Together — a college access program that serves underprivileged students — nearly fourfold, improving the organization’s transparency score and securing a $32,000 grant from Microsoft. 
Since 1987, the EST College Access program has guided students from foster youth systems and low-income households through the college search and application process to increase the graduation rate of students from these populations.
Yasmin Delahoussaye, the organization’s co-founder and treasurer, initially began the nonprofit with her husband, assisting these students in achieving academic success at prestigious universities. Now, after working with the Price students, the non-profit reported an additional $80,000 added to their funds through substantial grants.
As of 2021, more than two-thirds of college dropouts are low-income students, who Delahoussaye said are “vulnerable populations within our community.” Universities have the resources to support a diverse set of high achieving students, and one of Delahoussaye’s goals is to encourage them to access these resources. 
“It’s not that they don’t want to finish college, but they run out of money,” Delahoussaye said. “Because college is so doggone expensive … and [the mission] goes back to access and affordability for us.”
EST shows students how to stand out from the crowd and get into their dream college by giving SAT prep, teaching them financial literacy and providing ways to build generational wealth. 
“One of our top students in particular got a full ride into an accelerated medical degree program, where her undergraduate degree in biology will be paid for,” Delahoussaye said. “This young lady wants to be a neurosurgeon — which makes a million dollars a year — so think about how her life is going to change. She’s living in a single-parent household and her mom is making $25 an hour. ”
Shalei Heflin, a USC graduate with a masters in nonprofit leadership and management and criminal justice, worked with the team of Price students to increase funding for the organization, and said working with an organization that impacts real people motivated her to want to help low-income youth by refining her own capstone project. Heflin said the stakes were higher to succeed than in any other class she took for her master’s degree because she was accountable to multiple parties.
“[Working for EST] is not just like a case study, where we’re less hands-on … it was stressful for me in the sense that you want to be able to give them something that will actually create and catalyze change, rather than feel like you’re also taking their time,” Heflin said. 
Heflin said she felt connected to the organization because she, as a child, had incarcerated parents, and felt that her personal experience made her more socially aware of the disparities in education, as well as the stigma of those children falling into generational incarceration. She said she wants to work toward making higher education a right, rather than a privilege. 
“The [privilege] that I have been given allowed me to have the life that I have led, and I’m very grateful for that,” Heflin said. “Everybody deserves a chance to thrive, and I feel like higher education … is a way to help kids get out of systems that are harmful.”
Before joining EST as a mentee, Hung Jesse Ngo, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, wanted to apply to schools based primarily on financial aid. Delahoussaye and the organization encouraged and helped him apply to USC — his dream school. 
“For my high school, where people who did get into USC couldn’t go because of tuition, I was lucky enough to have the program help me appeal my financial aid and get more money to the point where it was much more affordable than all my other schools,” Ngo said.
Ngo, now a tutor at EST in his free time, wanted to give back to the organization and make the same difference in another student’s life as EST did for him.
“When I was one of the kids for the EST and I was doing the SAT program, the math tutor was really helpful and just drilled into concrete details, like quicker ways of finding the answers so you can save time to do other questions, and I kind of want to teach the other students how to do that too,” Ngo said. 
EST hosts an average of 50 students per year, Delahoussaye said, and having diversity in funding sources has been integral to the success of the organization. Although they received over 200 applications, it costs $2500 to host one student for the program, so acceptance is limited.
“In a perfect world, anyone who wanted to be in our program could be in our program,” Delahoussaye said. “Right now we’re serving a fourth of the number of kids we could be serving, … so there’s lots of students out there that I believe would take advantage of the opportunity if given an opportunity.”

This review contains spoilers.
As the saying goes, blood might be thicker than water, but when blood is the drink of choice for one’s family, “blood ties” become a lot more terrifying. Fundamentally altering one’s perceptions of liquids, “The Invitation” delivers a self-discovery drama in the envelope of a vampire horror film. Although the envelope (read: plot) is a bit difficult to decipher, the “letter” inside does offer some more meaning.
Directed by Jessica M. Thompson, “The Invitation” stars Nathalie Emmanuel as Evie, a lonely woman and ceramist living in New York City who discovers that she has a long-lost cousin in England named Oliver L. Alexander III (Hugh Skinner), or, as Evie’s best friend (Courtney Taylor) says, the “whitest man” she’s “ever seen.” 
Upon meeting, Oliver invites Evie to a family gathering for a wedding to take place in the English countryside. Evie reluctantly agrees, and once she arrives at the mansion, she is immediately seduced by its enigmatic “lord,” Walter DeVille (Thomas Doherty). In between her romance with Walter and “reconnecting” with her extended family, Evie reckons with the mansion’s inner horrors and soon finds that her “family” might be the real horror (they’re vampires). 
The first half of the film details how the mansion isn’t what it seems after Evie arrives, pulling off a standard tension buildup between Evie and the guests, her “family.” The second half is where the mystery falls apart — a necessary climax, as Evie realizes the mansion is full of vampires — but once the shock fades away, the rest of the film becomes a disorganized mess. 
First, there’s Evie’s attempt to escape, then, her confusing consumption of Walter’s power and finally, a dramatic exit from the mansion. This is all hastily wrapped up with an out-for-final-revenge ending that was seemingly tacked on at the end without the audience having the satisfaction to witness its results.
Looking at its entirety, the film could have benefited from being more self-aware. There were times when the vampire fangs and extended fingernails seemed almost like a parody of vampires and, to an extent, vampire movies. These seemingly ridiculous and exaggerated elements were implied to be serious additions to the horror genre — a presentation that didn’t quite work out given the comedic connotations of the vampire look.
With how the material was structured, “The Invitation” didn’t appear to capitalize on its variety of content effectively. The filmmakers seemingly chose to present the storyline as one rooted primarily in horror. Had the film leaned into more of its complexity and had there been some humor injected in certain moments, “The Invitation” could have been a genre-mashing creation and skillful new riff on gothic horror. 
In terms of actually creating the gothic horror elements, however, “The Invitation” does a pretty remarkable job with the set design. There are some genuinely scary jump scares littered throughout the first half of the film, all embedded within the dark and mysterious atmosphere of the mansion. As the maids are asked to run errands throughout the house, the viewer follows along their journeys in the mansion’s various rooms, watching as seemingly “normal” errands transition into creepy encounters with the supernatural. 
There appears to be a deeper message present in the film about what “blood ties’’ really mean, given that this is a vampire horror as well as a drama of a lonely woman seeking a family. It’s a bit hidden, but still present. It really comes to light with Emmanuel, who manages to channel a complicated vulnerability for her character in an empowering way. 
It could be said that Emmanuel’s performance is truly the film’s saving grace in making Evie an empathetic character. By portraying Evie’s desire for connection with others, Emmanuel helps shed some light on why Evie continues to stay in the mansion even when she starts becoming aware of its oddities. 
Another well-developed dynamic within the story is Evie being perceived as an “Other.” “The Invitation” introduces some subtle commentary on race and class inequalities into the story when Evie, a Black woman who comes from a low-income background, enters this mansion full of wealthy, white individuals who not only don’t understand her financial difficulties, but even make digs at her assumed inferiority. 
On the superficial level, there’s the “Othering” of Evie as a mortal in a house of vampires. On the other hand, Evie is an “outsider” in terms of both race and class, as well as being a foreigner in an unfamiliar country. These nuances give power and intention to the film in capturing the heart of relevant — and arguably much more realistic — issues. 
Given the lasting impressions of this “event,” one might not call “The Invitation” a “bloody brilliant” film. For those who seek blood, there’s quite a lot of it. As for brilliance, well, it might not be the drink of choice.

Welcome to USC, the start of a new chapter, your next four years, your supposed gateway to professional adulthood and the first time many of you will live on your own. It’s up to you now to watch out for yourself. Here’s a quick list of safety-related frequently asked questions and, hopefully, suitable answers.
Is the area around campus really that bad?
There’s a stereotype that the University Park Campus is smack dab in the middle of one of the “sketchiest” parts of L.A, but according to David Carlisle, interim chief of the Department of Public Safety, that might not be completely true.
“I think it is a safe place if students take reasonable precautions,” Carlisle said. “USC still suffers from an outdated image of being in an unsafe area of Los Angeles, but the community has changed over the last few decades. And so, it’s my thought that it is a safe place to live, work, go to school, if you take reasonable precautions that would be applicable in any big city.”
Carlisle, a veteran law enforcement officer, noted that the University’s crime statistics compare “pretty favorably” to other similar West Coast campuses, and annual security reports indicate that that’s true.
USC reported a total of 412 instances of robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, motor vehicular theft and arson between 2018 and 2020. UCLA reported 449 cases, and UC Berkeley reported 847. Tough to be a Bruin.
Now, none of this is to say that USC is so safe and idyllic that you shouldn’t make smart choices, nor is it to say that it’s your fault if you are a victim of these crimes, but all of us can make choices that put us in safer positions.
How can I stay safe at parties?
Go with a trusted friend. Know your drinking limits. Don’t drive home if you drink. You know, all the things you’ve probably already heard if you’ve recently completed any sort of mandatory alcohol training module through the University.
“Make smart choices,” Carlisle said. “If a situation doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t. Don’t drink a drink that you didn’t open or make yourself, because there have been allegations of drugs added to drinks.”
You also shouldn’t feel pressured to go to parties in the first place if they’re not your thing. Not everybody’s into that stuff (including myself).
What about video surveillance?
A great question that probably nobody (including myself) was wondering. Carlisle had an answer, though.
“Now, all universities, colleges, amusement parks, shopping complexes, have security cameras,” he said. “The difference is, USC DPS has over 300 security cameras that we are live monitoring 24/7 … on and … off campus where our students live.”
So, for instance, if a camera operator sees a student walking alone off campus at night, they can give that student a “video escort” to make sure they get home safely, or radio for help if it’s needed, all without the student knowing. 
“Kind of like the spy movies,” I quipped.
“It’s for public safety,” Carlisle countered. “And there’s nothing on there that we are accessing that isn’t public. For instance, people say, ‘Oh, you’re photographing cars driving down the street.’ Just like anybody else could. ‘Oh, wait, you have a camera watching this person?’ Yeah, they’re by themselves, we’re uncomfortable [with] where they are, let’s keep an eye on them and make sure they’re okay.”
(A later trip to the communications center revealed that it does, in fact, look kind of like the spy movies.)
Some other thoughts
Via Carlisle: Don’t walk around on your phone; it’ll get snatched. Register your bike with DPS to increase the likelihood of you getting your bike back if it’s stolen.
Via USC Safety: Don’t walk around with headphones in or while surfing the web. You’re more likely to get caught off guard in dangerous situations.
Via common sense: Lock your doors. Don’t leave your expensive stuff out in the open. 
Now, to stay safe from…
(1) Upperclassmen, who have the potential to make your life here easier: Don’t brag about your accomplishments, your course load, or, for the love of God, your SAT scores. Your mom might be proud that you got into USC, but literally nobody else cares. Like, we’re all here, don’t turn your allies into your enemies. 
(2) Your roommates, who have the potential to make your life here harder: Take your roommate contract seriously, and don’t be afraid to modify it if certain things come up over the course of the year.
(3) Yourself: Find ways to be active. Don’t sacrifice your personal health for grades. Learn to say no to things.
(4) Debt (at least as much of it as you can avoid): Don’t buy textbooks from the USC Bookstore if your professors don’t make you bring a physical copy to class. The internet is filled with wonders, and that includes free PDFs of textbooks. Search up Library Genesis and save your money.
You’ve got this.

Leimert Park came out in full attendance to their Jazz Festival, with hours of jazz artists performing from start to finish. The festival took place at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza on the upper deck of the parking lot. It saw tents galore, full of art, vendors, merchants and activities for members of the neighborhood and beyond. 
Though this was the third annual LPJF, the event’s roots date back to 2015, when executive producer Diane Robertson began hosting the Sutro Avenue Summer Soirée block party in Leimert. She noticed that despite the neighborhood having a deep and rich jazz scene among the city’s wealth of festivals and concerts, there was no eponymous jazz show hosted in Leimert.
To fill the void, she approached her friend and Executive Director of The World Stage in Leimert Park Village Dwight Trible to ask him to curate a jazz stage at the event. After its introduction in 2018, the stage became so popular that the block party was renamed the Leimert Park Jazz Festival in 2020. Throughout the growth of the event, contributors say that the spirit of the original block party has remained.
“It started as a block party event,” said Leimert Park Native and jazz festival volunteer Cima Lawson. “Diane Robertson kind of started the festival, started it on her block as just a community. Everyone was invited, but it was just a block party — she still had a lot of great artists and vendors. People from the community came out and then it just got bigger every year … And now it’s a wonderful event with sponsors and community leaders who come out.” 
At the center of the festival grounds was an art exhibit featuring local works, with the main stage propped up before hundreds of chairs and tables. The sea of socializing space was filled with people connecting, meeting new neighbors and listening to the festival’s variety of artists perform. With Leimert Park being predominantly Black, the festival was a great space for Black artists and groups to showcase their talents to a diverse crowd. 
The festival hosted a variety of Black businesses and vendors, providing a great atmosphere to match and enhance the music. Some of the businesses that attended the event were Sole Folks, Nappily Naturals, Sika, Queen Aminah’s Clothing and more.
Each vendor at LPJF brought a message along with their merchandise. Sole Folks, for instance, is a clothing store located on Degnan Boulevard that’s creating more than just apparel for the community. The store is used to fund their non-profit organization of the same name, which focuses on supporting and building up over 50 global black businesses. 
“We work with designers, creatives and entrepreneurs, to basically give them a playground to get the ideas out of their heads and into real-world markets,” said Himyo Green, a member of the Sole Folks co-op.
As for dining options, there was a great variety available for the audience, with Jammrok serving Jamaican cuisine, D’Ville’s Grille dishing out soul food and Hot + Cool Cafe catering to the vegans, among many other options from local Leimert kitchens.
The listening audience saw nine sets of different styles of jazz, ranging across generations and subgenres. Among these were several highlight performances: John Beasley’s MONK’estra’s groovy jazz set, and Kamau Daáood and A Band of Griots’ spoken word jazz performance, and around 10 minutes of Grammy-nominated Latin jazz artist Pete Escovedo.
There were plenty of world-class talents in attendance at the festival, with the aforementioned Escovedo co-headlining the event with fellow Grammy-nominated artist Patrice Rushen — who is also the chair of the Popular Music program at USC — Ernie Watts, Marvin “Smitty” Smith and Edwin Livingston.
The festival started at 12:20 p.m., with the first two sets, the Fernando Pullum Community Arts Center Youth Jazz Band and the S.H.I.N.E. Mawusi Women’s African Drum Circle, lasting around 20 minutes each. After that, the Leimert Park Experience performed their set for 40 minutes, followed by a 30-minute tribute set for Barbara Morrison and Derf Reklaw, who both made their name in jazz in Los Angeles and passed away this year. Then came the two aforementioned sets, followed by the two headlining sets, topped off with a performance by Munyungo’s Jungle Jazz.
From start to finish, an abundance of people could be seen bobbing their heads along to the music, and if they were comfortable enough, dancing their heart away to some great live jazz. There was also a bit of a treat for those who attended, with an unlisted guest appearance from Grammy award-winning jazz singer Dianne Reeves who came out for a song alongside John Beasley’s MONK’estra. 
Also ever present was a plethora of volunteers around helping make sure the festival ran as smoothly as possible.
“There’s nowhere else I would sign up for a five-hour volunteer shift,” Lawson said, “My favorite part so far, even though I’ve been working, was [when] Dianne Reeves came out and performed and she wasn’t on the schedule. So that was a nice little surprise. I love her as a jazz artist.”
Full of great vibes, Leimert Park Jazz Festival highlighted three of the neighborhood’s prized qualities on Saturday: Jazz. Community. Culture.

“U… S… C!”
The rhythmic chant returned to the Galen Center as women’s volleyball hosted the Cardinal and Gold Classic to start the 2022 regular season.
The Trojans swept their competition 3-0, needing only the minimum nine sets to defeat Colgate College, University of Maryland, Baltimore County and Villanova University over the weekend.
“They exceeded [my expectations] a little bit, but don’t tell them that,” said head coach Brad Keller. “​​We’ve had a history coming out slow the past two seasons, which has bitten us a couple of times. Just the level of mindfulness and being on it, and the next point mentality was really, really good for us.”
USC began its campaign with an authoritative straight-set victory (25-13, 25-20, 25-12) over Colgate on Friday. The night belonged to senior outside hitter Skylar Fields, who scored 15 points on 13 kills in her Trojans debut.
Fresh off of an American Volleyball Coaches Association All-American third team selection while with the Texas Longhorns last season, Fields will most definitely be an impact player for USC — a program that has parted ways with two of its three top scorers from last season.
“I think [Fields] is an ultimate competitor,” Keller said. “She wants to be a complete six rotation player, and she’s been working through that. I think she’s opened up her game a little bit, and we need it obviously, too.”
Fields led the team with 36 kills after the trio of games in the Cardinal and Gold Classic.
To start day two of the tournament, USC won 3-0 against UMBC in a quick but intense morning match. The team’s offense was facilitated by sophomore setter Mia Tuaniga, leading the Trojans with 38 assists. 
“She’s the floor general and she’s really good,” Keller said. “She just creates opportunities for so many people with the way she sets the ball.”
On a weekend that might have seemed like a breeze for the Trojans, their longest and most dramatic set came against UMBC. In the second set of the match, USC found themselves down as much as 6-15 before mounting an epic 30-28 victory in extended play. A few service errors dragged out the nailbiter but three straight kills, two from graduate middle blocker Kalyah Williams and one from freshman outside hitter Dani Thomas-Nathan, put the set to bed.
USC was able to route the Retrievers 25-12 in the third and final set to secure its second win of the season.
To cap off the tournament, USC hosted Villanova on Saturday night. Over the weekend, the Wildcats defeated Colgate 3-2 but were uprooted by both UMBC and USC in consecutive games.
Fields led the match with 14 kills, while Williams and senior opposite hitter Emilia Weske anchored the defense with 3 block assists each.
“We’ve been working all spring and all summer together, waiting for this very special moment to finally step on the court and ball out,” Weske said. “We kept our focus. We were mentally and physically prepared for this whole weekend and really went through with a Trojan spirit.”
Keller had high praise for Weske after the tournament. 
“She’s consistent,” Keller said. “She puts up a huge block. She’s learning how to pass and play the entire game, opening up her entire repertoire a little bit. She’s like a mother hen right now, always calm, cool and collected.”
In the preseason AVCA rankings, USC was placed No. 24 to begin the season. 
Next weekend, USC will travel to Omaha for the Blue Jay Invitational Tournament, where they will face No. 11 ranked Creighton University, No. 8 University of Kentucky and Northern Iowa University, beginning Sept. 2. 
“You want to be number one,” Keller said. “I don’t care about rankings until the very end and we’re the last team standing.”

Coal miners occupy a pretty special place in my heart. And no, it’s not because I know any. Georgia, where I grew up, isn’t really known for its coal anyways. Maybe part of it comes from the fact that John Prine’s “Paradise” and Tennessee Ernie Ford’s “Sixteen Tons” — both coal miners’ laments — regularly appear in my most played country playlists (never mind the fact that I have the music taste of a 58-year-old Ohioan). I think a large part of that fondness comes from a place of understanding that no profession is quite as hard-caught between a rock and a hard place as coal mining.
Very few jobs today are as dangerous as the job of a coal miner. Employees in the coal industry are more likely to be killed on the job, and their injuries are more likely to be severe compared to those in other jobs. The danger also doesn’t just stop when a coal miner stops working, as the toxic gas and coal dust inhaled by miners toiling away underneath the surface of the earth often results in long-term diseases. Chief among those diseases is black lung, which scars lung tissue and makes it harder for those affected by it to breathe in the long term. 
One would think that folks experiencing this much risk on and off the job would be riding the unionization wave to get better job and health benefits. Unfortunately, it just isn’t the case with mine workers, especially in the South and those in the heart of Alabama.
Members of United Mine Workers of America in Alabama have been on strike for more than 500 days — longer than I’ve been on this campus. Actually, the strike has been going on for longer than “I Reckon” has been in existence. Like my column, the strike is starting to show signs of an inevitable slowdown. What originally started as a striking force at around 1,100 strong has dwindled down to around 900 or so. And yet, they’re still fighting the good fight. In the UMWA’s case, however, they have a new antagonist in the form of the National Labor Relations Board. 
In late July, the NLRB ordered the UMWA to pay $13.3 million to Warrior Met Coal, a settlement number that was 33 times the estimated amount that the UMWA had originally thought, and that was initially indicated by NLRB lawyers. A huge chunk of that amount is chalked up to lost revenue from coal that’s gone unmined as well as increased security. 
Never mind that members of the UMWA took on pay cuts to help bring the company out of bankruptcy in 2016. You’d be hard-pressed to find that level of self-sacrifice in any workforce today, much less in 2016. To that, I say good riddance to Warrior Met Coal’s lost revenue. If the NLRB cracked open a dictionary, they’d understand that a strike is an action, often involving a ceasing of work, in order to get an employer to comply with demands. What’s the point of a strike when the employees of a company have to end up paying the company for lost time and work? If that’s a new NLRB philosophy moving forward, I think it might as well be the end of this new age of labor.
The Biden administration has done a somewhat decent job so far with regard to new appointees to the NLRB, putting more labor-friendly folks in those positions of power. This new, aggressive NLRB was helpful in the unionization of the Amazon warehouse in Staten Island earlier this year, and just this week, it is demanding that Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz apologize to unionized Starbucks workers whose raises had been illegally withheld.
Could you imagine the uproar that would ensue if the NLRB forced Starbucks union members to pay millions to their already uber-wealthy employer for revenue lost during their strikes and walkouts? The NLRB ought to treat the Warrior Met strike with as much pro-labor vigor as it treated workers in other industries across the country. 
No matter how far we move past coal, the folks that worked in that industry will always bear the scar of the mines. We shouldn’t force them to bear another scar in the name of corporate preservation.
