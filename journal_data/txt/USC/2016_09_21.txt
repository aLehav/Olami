Jessica Zhou | Daily TrojanManning the cage · Junior goalkeeper McQuin Baron has been stellar in goal for the men’s water polo team in the early going. Baron, who played for Team USA in the Rio Olympics, entered the season with 570 career saves.
The No. 2 men’s water polo team, fresh off a 8-4 victory at No. 5 Stanford, will play No. 19 Santa Clara (4-4) on Friday to open up the Mountain Pacific Invitational held at UC Berkeley. A win there pits them against the winner of No. 7 Long Beach State and No. 11 UC Davis. 
After recording his 500th career victory as the head coach of the men’s team against Stanford, Jovan Vavic heads into the weekend with the goal of coming out with 504 wins to his name (USC could potentially play four matches it if advances to the championship).
If USC goes perfect in the tournament, a number one ranking could be waiting.
This season, the Men of Troy have exhibited supreme defense, allowing just 17 goals in six games despite playing four top-25 teams. 
Leading the way is Team USA’s goalie, junior McQuin Baron, who shut down Stanford’s power play opportunities thanks to eight saves. His goaltending provides excellent coverage of top opposing scorers, and Baron receives a lot of credit for the USC defense.
The Trojans’ defense can also lead to offense — on a power play opportunity, freshman driver Marin Dasic blocked a potential goal that junior driver Grant Stein converted into a score for the Trojans.
Although Stanford earned 2 goals apiece in the second and fourth periods off of a USC deflection and penalty shot, the Men of Troy’s offense was potent. 
Along with Stein and junior Blake Edward’s two goals each, junior James Walters and freshmen Thomas Dunstan, Matt Maier and Dasic all netted goals for the Trojans. 
Against Stanford, the Trojans played typical USC water polo: breaking out of the gates firing on all cylinders (3-0 after one quarter) and finishing the game strong (3 goals in the final quarter).
This weekend, the undefeated Trojans hope to continue their streak against a Santa Clara team that has experienced adversity this season on its way to a No. 19 ranking.
The Broncos, with an even 4-4 record, look to upset the Trojans despite a two-game losing streak. Against Pacific and UC Davis, Santa Clara was outscored 32-7 as the Tigers and Aggies netted around 50 percent of their shot attempts. 
Along with a defense that has allowed an average of 10.1 goals per game, the Broncos offense has only netted an average of six goals per game in their four losses.
If USC can get on the board early, the Trojans should be able to dominate the time of possession numbers and control the tempo of the game.
After Santa Clara, USC will have a much more formidable opponent in either the UC Davis Aggies or the Long Beach State 49ers. Of the two, USC should prepare for Davis, as it is the stronger of the two teams. 
In 10 games this season, the Aggies have scored 13.2 goals per game, while allowing 7.9. Thanks to a myriad of scorers, UC Davis can score from all sides of the pool. Cory Laidig, Riley Venne, Sasa Antunovic, Ido Goldschmidt, Morgan Olson-Fabbro and Marcus Anderson all have scored 12 goals or more in 2016. Considering this balanced attack, USC’s defense could be in for an offensive slugfest come Saturday.

Emily Smith | Daily TrojanAdoree’ on offense? · Junior Adoree’ Jackson may suit up as a wide receiver in addition to his defensive and kick return duties.
USC football held practice at Howard Jones Field on Wednesday, desperate for momentum after dropping two of its first three games. The Trojans suffered a loss at Stanford last weekend, prompting a quarterback change from head coach Clay Helton, and they look to get their season back on track with a win at Utah on Friday.
Dynamic Defense
Cornerback Adoree’ Jackson went through some offensive drills after practice. Helton said they were routine and didn’t mention anything about getting his junior more involved on offense, but he did praise Jackson’s impact on that side of the ball.
“He’s one of the most football-smart guys I have ever been associated with. [He’s] so instinctive, it literally takes a walkthrough meeting and he’s ready to go,” Helton said. “We always carry six to eight plays for him.”
Helton emphasized, however, that Jackson and the rest of the Trojan defense had to make strides after an inconsistent start to the campaign. USC has been susceptible to giving up the big play in recent weeks, a tendency Helton was keen to eliminate.
Although there is much work still to be done, Helton was optimistic, pointing to another group of players that has made similar adjustments in the season’s early going.
“You’ve seen the offensive line getting better with each week, and that’s what our whole team needs to do,” he said. “It comes through reps, experience, and meetings.”
Helton also admitted he carries the responsibility of effecting change and correcting mistakes in the program.
“It starts with me,” he said. “I take a lot of pride in guys doing the right thing, and I look forward to those corrections being made this week—and in a hurry. We need them to.”
Injury Updates
Helton provided updates for a number of injured Trojans, including redshirt senior tight end Taylor McNamara, whose foot injury was confirmed as a bruise after x-rays were negative.
Offensive tackle Chuma Edoga sat out practice with a stomach virus, and the sophomore required three bags of fluid from an IV. Helton said he hoped to have his lineman back by Thursday’s morning walkthrough.
Redshirt sophomore Malik Dorton was called a “game-time decision,” as the defensive tackle continued to nurse a hip issue. Freshman tailback Vavae Malepeai also practiced for the first time since breaking his scapula in late August. Helton estimated Malepeai was still about two weeks away from contact drills but called the freshman’s return “really, really good news.”
Junior John Plattenburg was also back in practice after losing over a month to a concussion. Helton was impressed by how well his safety was recovering but admitted the coaching staff had to be “extra protective” easing him into action. Next week’s game against Arizona State was mentioned as a possible return date.
Defensive tackle Noah Jefferson was away from the team dealing with personal issues, and Helton said the sophomore would be back on campus on Friday. Jefferson will not travel to Utah but was ruled out of the game regardless thanks to a lingering shoulder problem.
The team flies out for Salt Lake City on Thursday with rain in the game-time forecast, and USC will take on the Utes at 6 p.m. on Friday.
“We’ve prepared [for rain] for three days,” Helton said. “We’re looking forward to getting to Utah and competing against them.”

Kyleen Hengelhaupt | Daily TrojanStreak snapped · Sophomore outside hitter Alyse Ford spikes the ball in USC’s defeat to UCLA on Wednesday, as the win streak ended.
The No. 21 women’s volleyball team could not rally to beat No. 9 UCLA, as the Trojans’ eight-match win streak came to end with a 3-1 loss to the Bruins on Wednesday at the Galen Center. 
There was much anticipation leading up to the team’s Pac-12 play opener against their crosstown rivals, as UCLA was the only team to beat the Trojans at home last season.
“No one likes to lose to the Bruins,” head coach Mick Haley said. “And I am the worst loser of the bunch.”
The Trojans started off the first set strong with tight blocks and strong kills, but the Bruins responded with on target passing and strong kills of their own. The two teams rallied back and forth, with neither team being able to pull farther than one or two points ahead for most of the game.
Not only were the two teams very evenly matched, but they both also ran a two setter-system throughout the match. While the Trojans have been using this system all season long with junior and senior setters Reni Meyer-Whalley and Alice Pizzasegola, it is the first time the Bruins have used it this season.
UCLA quickly established dominance by taking the first set 25-22, but the Trojans answered. USC’s two middles, junior and senior blockers Jordan Dunn and Elise Ruddins, led the way for the team in being able to pull away with a second-set victory, as Dunn had three blocks, and the two had seven kills combined. The two seemed to make a play every time they touched the ball.
Sophomore libero Victoria Garrick, filling in for the injured libero Taylor Whittingham, also stepped up with 24 digs, keeping the Trojans’ passing at a high level. 
“Not having Taylor out there was certainly disruptive,” Haley said. “But isn’t an excuse because Victoria did a great job. She came in there and you hardly knew there was a difference.”
Along with powerful performances from Ruddins and Dunn, junior outside hitter Niki Withers and junior opposite Brittany Abercrombie also put up impressive numbers, with 13 and six kills respectively. All of the Trojans came out to play though, as scoring was more spread out among the players than it has been all season so far.
Despite spreading their scoring, impressive digs and strong blocks, the Trojans played from behind for almost all of the fourth set, down 2-1 in the match. At one point, the Trojans were down 14-7, only to make a comeback, bringing the score to 22-22. However, after long rallies for single points, it was the Bruins that came out on top with a victory after winning the fourth set 29-27.
Bruins outside hitter Reily Buechler had a game-high 21 kills and was a huge factor into their victory. UCLA had more service errors than the Trojans but made up those points with more kills. 
“I am encouraged about where we could go,” Haley said. “This was our first test against a top 10 team and if that was a top 10 team, then I think we can be pretty good this year.”
The Trojans’ next match is against Washington University this Friday at Galen Center at 7 p.m.
Moral victories are not what a top program is all about. This was a home match. They will lose once again to UW in a
home match on Friday. Great scheduling having the match being played during the football game. Playing better for
sure than the first three matches which were pathetic. The goal is to make the ncaa tourney somehow, and hope the
team has reached its best by then. All the matches left on the road will be a big problem in this tough conference.

The saying “what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” is not always the case. The USC football program has shown that. They’ve battled innumerable problems and distractions and have come out much weaker for it.
The football program hasn’t been the same since the departure of Pete Carroll and Reggie Bush, and let’s face it, chances are it never will be again. Certainly it could be, but everything since then until today proves otherwise.
With each dramatic off- or on-the-field incident or firing that occurs, USC continues to distance itself from the glorified dynasty that once ruled Troy.
This year — the year things were supposed to quiet down with a new athletic director and a new head coach — has been just as dramatic, if not more so, than other years in recent memory. Keep in mind we are only four weeks into the regular season, and already there has been a player charged with rape and another player associated with the crime, not to mention the more “practical” drama that includes a quarterback change, a losing record and only scoring one touchdown against two ranked opponents this year — am I forgetting anything here?
USC is just a soap opera and it saddens me, not because of the unrealistic expectation that we would come back from sanctions unscathed, but because of the lack of progress and leadership that anyone in a position of power chooses to display.
Impatient fans and greedy donors’ insatiable appetite to win has worked against the Trojans and soon the team will be in a place it cannot recover from.
In the three years that I have been here, the situation has gotten increasingly and noticeably worse. Two years ago, cornerback Josh Shaw suffered an injury after jumping off a balcony for what he said was an effort to save a drowning child. Shaw actually jumped off the balcony to evade police following an argument he had with his girlfriend. Being the naïve freshman that I was, I assumed that would be the worst thing that happened to the team during my time as a Trojan.
Then, when I was a sophomore, then-head coach (and current Alabama assistant) Steve Sarkisian had his run-in with alcohol embarrassing former athletic director Pat Haden to the point that he was fired midway through the season.
Helton was supposed to be the coach that calmed everything down and gave the team the blue-collar attitude it needed to stop the uncontrollable fall from grace. The cycle is nowhere close to ending either. 
Coming out of the sanction years, the expectation that USC would bounce right back was ridiculous and now there hasn’t been enough stability to convince a JV football player that playing at USC would be the right choice. The thing that Lane Kiffin, Sarkisian and now Helton must realize is that nothing short of perfection will ever be satisfactory to USC. Coaches — though I won’t argue that Kiffin and Sarkisian were never the right coach — haven’t been given the chance to stay here long enough to cement themselves as the consistent leaders that this program needs.
Helton’s first season is off to a rocky start, but so was Pete Caroll’s. Does that mean that Helton is the coach who is going to turn the program around? I don’t know. No one does. But with a new athletic director behind him, he certainly has the opportunity. 
Helton needs to resell USC, something no fan ever thought would happen, but instead of consistently having one of the top recruiting classes in the country, now the team struggles to fill a class with 5-star recruits.
If I were a top high school prospect, I don’t think I would want to come to USC. There has been too much drama in the past three years alone whereas if you are talented enough to play at a powerhouse school, the amount of drama that USC has in one year would amount to be more than most of those schools see over a player’s four-year career.
There is no easy solution for this disenfranchisement, but certainly strong leadership and patience helps, something that has been lacking in the football program for many years.
I hate to see the talent and collegiate career of the stars USC has on its team go to waste, but junior cornerback Adoree’ Jackson said it best after the deflating loss to Stanford on Saturday.
“At the end of the day, it’s unacceptable,” he said. “I didn’t come from a losing program. I’m not used to losing.”
No one at USC is used to losing.
The Trojans are still the most recent Pac-12 team to capture a national title, but they haven’t won it in 12 years. As the program and the school are still trying to emulate that success, eyebrows need to be raised. Why is it taking this long and more importantly, why is the team regressing?
USC needs to turn its football team around before it is too late.

Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
Stevie Tu’ikolovatu still uses a flip phone.
He’s a 6-foot-1, 320-pound left tackle for the University of Southern California. His fingers barely fit the buttons and he hunches his shoulders as he types. 
His teammates tease him for it, but Stevie doesn’t mind. It’s cheap, he says. He doesn’t have to freak out if he drops it, and it keeps him off social media. It just makes the most sense.
That’s Stevie. He never asks for more than he needs. He knows what he loves in life — football, family, faith — and he doesn’t spend time worrying about much else. And if there’s any type of stereotypical mold for a college football player, he shatters it. 
He’s 25, happily married, a father. He’s working toward a Master’s in gerontology. He’s a devout Mormon, several years older than most of his teammates after taking two years off to fulfill his mission in the Philippines. 
And he’s a starter for one of the winningest football programs of all-time. 
In many ways, he has it all. But a year ago, it was a slightly different story. He was second-string for the University of Utah, still trying to claw his way back into the starting rotation after an injury suffered two years before. He was finishing up his sociology degree and trying to figure out if football was really meant for him.
It’s only been a few months since Stevie left Utah to take a chance on USC. But as he returns to face Utah this weekend with three games under his belt, he has to admit — life as a Trojan is looking up.
***
From the beginning, Stevie was taken seriously on the football field.
It started when he was seven, just a kid from Utah who grew up loving the violence of the game. By the time he hit sixth grade, he was the kind of kid that no one wanted to play football with at recess. Even if it was just touch. He was too big. He hit too hard. He didn’t know how to take it easy. 
He was the third of four brothers and spent most of his time at home wrestling and fighting. They were a football family, and Stevie was raised in the bleachers of football stadiums, watching his brothers from the sidelines. By the time he was ten, he told his mom he would play in the NFL someday.
His career took the normal trajectory of a stand-out athlete — playing varsity as a freshman, acting as the star of the team by senior year, committing to play for the college he rooted for as a kid.
He had plenty to look up to — his uncle, Sione Po’uha, played defensive tackle for nine years with the New York Jets. Growing up, Po’uha was tangible proof of what he could achieve.
“I’ve always looked up to him as the kind of person I want to be,” Stevie said. “It was a real human being reaching the same goals that I have and coming from the same background, the same city, same position, same everything. Everything’s the same.”
Up until age 19, football was Stevie’s main focus. But after redshirting for his freshman year at Utah, he took two years off of college for the most important experience of his life — his mission.
Every Mormon has the option to take part in a missionary, a two-year project in a different community with a goal of bringing locals into the faith. Stevie was assigned to the Philippines, a country he’d barely heard of before.
Shortly before he left, Stevie had a dream, the type that remained fresh in his memory for months afterwards. He was sitting in a house with a floor made of sand, listening to a voice he didn’t recognize in a language he didn’t understand. Outside, the wind was blowing a palm tree gently.
He had no idea why he remembered the dream, why it was so vivid or stuck to him so closely. He shook it off and followed his call.
Every day for two years was the same — rise at 6:30, study the Bible and local languages, then head out into the community until well past dinner. It was fulfilling work, but Stevie carried the heavy weight of living up to what he believed was his call from God.
“It’s kind of scary because you’re young, but you’re expected to do maybe even more than grown ups do because you’re on the other side of the world, living on your own,” Stevie said. “You’re on a different part of the world trying to preach something that not the normal 19-year-old would be interested in. That pressure’s always up because you don’t want to mess up.”
A year and a half into his mission, Stevie visited a local family to teach a lesson from the Bible.
As his companion launched into his lesson, Stevie began to daydream. His mind wandered, eyes tracing around the room and settling on the window as his thoughts slipped away for a moment.
Then, it clicked.
This was his dream. Everything was the same — the house, the family huddled on the couch across from him, the view out the window. Only one thing had changed. After a year and a half on the island, Stevie was fluent in Ilocano and Cebuano. He could understand every word his companion said.
Stevie took it as a sign. He was in the right place at the right time. From then on, he didn’t worry at all. The dream stuck with him, pushing him to stay close to his faith, to trust he was on the right path, even when he left the Philippines at the end of his mission.
When Stevie returned from his mission, he came back with a purpose. It was November 2012, right in the middle of football season. He had lost 110 pounds, dropping to 240 —the lightest he could remember weighing since sixth grade. He set goals for his new life in Utah. He wanted to gain back the weight and gain back his spot on the Utah team.
The gaining weight part was easy — “I love to eat,” Stevie said, holding his hands up with a grin. But after his mission, everything was easier, especially football. He knew he was more grounded, more focused in the gym and on the field. By summer training camp, he was a starter, excitedly gearing up for his first college game.
It didn’t take much for that to change. In a pileup during practice, Stevie tore several ligaments crisscrossing the top of his left foot. It meant surgery, a pin, two plates, 12 screws and months of rehabilitation. There was only one week left before the season began.
It was the first time Stevie ever questioned football.
The doctor asked if he wanted to keep playing football. He warned that many athletes don’t recover from this type of injury, that the rehab would be grueling. For a moment, Stevie paused, unsure what to think.
“It was depressing, man,” Stevie said. “I felt like I worked hard for something and it got taken away, and I didn’t do anything wrong. I tried to live my life right and do everything right. I just felt like, I don’t know if this sport’s for me, dude.”
He didn’t quit. Stevie loves football. He loves playing, competing, being on a team, grinding out a hard win. He doesn’t quit easily. But Stevie also started thinking about a future without football.
He began taking over 20 units a semester. He set a goal of graduating with a sociology degree in three years. He did it in two and a half. Stevie’s starts were few and far between and he never found himself in the same rhythm with the Utah team. But in the meantime, he found his Plan B.
Still, Stevie wanted something new. Even as a senior, he wasn’t starting for Utah. It wasn’t a lack of effort or intensity in practice. He just couldn’t seem to make it back into the rotation. And though Stevie was no longer questioning whether football was right for him, he began to question if Utah was right for his future.
So he took a chance. In May, he graduated from Utah and applied to the USC gerontology program. He came to Los Angeles unsure if he would even have a spot on the team. Half a year later, as a starter, he grins when he thinks about the risk he took.
“The risk paid off big time,” Stevie said. “It paid off more than I expected, and I hope that I’m giving the team and the University more than they expected. It’s one of the best choices I ever made.”
That faith — that it will all work out, that he will find his place — was found on his mission. It’s one of the many ways that Stevie holds his mission and his religion close to his heart. When he needs inspiration, he thinks back to what he learned in the Philippines.
If he tried to explain all that he learned, he says, he’d be talking all day. He laughs at the idea of trying to describe that journey in a few simple sentences. But if he has to choose, the biggest lesson came down to love.
“I learned to love everyone the right way, to love everyone and see everyone the way that Jesus looks at them and Jesus loves them,” Stevie said. “After it’s all said and done, we all belong to one family. The people I served is[sic] literally my brothers and sisters. The best thing I’ve learned is to look at them, to love them and to serve them like Jesus would do.”
In many ways, his teammates see this in every practice. He checks in on his fellow linemen, gives them advice or pep talks when they need it. He greets younger players, like freshman lineman Connor Murphy, every day, shouting “Hey Murph-dog, you good over there?” as he warms up and stretches out his legs.
“I’m pretty sure big old Stevie could probably be my dad,” Murphy joked. “He’s like seven or eight years older than I am. I’m just a little freshman. He’s just a huge leader on this team. Soon as he’s come in, he’s demanded respect, not by his words or anything, but by his physical presence. This guy is a sound leader.”
And in many ways, that’s what Stevie brings to the Trojan defensive line. Entering the offseason, the defensive front for USC was one of its larger areas of concern. The defensive line lost six players from its 2015 rotation, including redshirt junior Kenny Bigelow Jr., who suffered a season-ending knee injury during spring workouts.
Following Bigelow’s injury, speculation arose regarding the inexperienced USC defensive line that would be led by a new, first-year coach in Kenechi Udeze this season. Stevie appeared to be an answer to many of the questions of experience on the line.
“He is an older guy who’s had game experience coming from a great program in Utah,” said senior linebacker and team captain Michael Hutchings. “He’s a big-time game changer for us [by] being in the middle and being that run-stopper. I said it in camp, he’s a huge difference-maker for our defense; It was a blessing for him to come to our team.”
And Stevie’s size makes him an ideal nose tackle for defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s “5-2” scheme — which calls for a stout, wide, defensive tackle to occupy blockers while other defenders roam free to pressure the edges. 
“He’s been a really great addition, not only to the defensive line, but to our whole defense,” Pendergast said. “He leads by example, and the other players gravitate towards his work ethic.”
After the Tuesday practice preparing for the Utah game, Stevie stays the latest out of the defensive line, working on hand technique with a dummy on the side of the field. The second he steps away from his workout, he is swarmed by reporters who press microphones close to catch his soft, underspoken voice. 
He doesn’t always get this level of media attention, but with his upcoming return to Utah, Stevie is right in the center of the spotlight. He’s asked how he feels about returning home, and he laughs, joking that he’s ordered 60 tickets for his family.
“I can’t wait, man,” he said. “I’m excited. I know the boys at Utah are excited. I talk to those boys every day. I’ll probably get boo’ed a couple times, but that’s the game of football.”
The Utah game will be a return to the past for Stevie, a chance to prove that he’s grown, that he’s made the right choice. Compared to a disappointing 1-2 start for USC, the Utes sit on comfortable 3-0 beginning to their season, and quarterback changes have left fans questioning whether the Trojans will even out their record this weekend.
But for Stevie, this weekend will be a victory, no matter what. His role here at USC has been different — a starter, a leader from the very beginning. He’s found a new home.
“The big thing about Stevie being here right now is how well he’s playing defensive tackle,” Helton said. “I think his first three games have been phenomenal. The maturity level that he’s brought, he’s grown a lot of young kids up in a hurry, so I’m very thankful he’s here.”
The scrum of reporters ask what makes him most excited about being at USC. His answer is immediate — the education. 
It surprises a few. But that’s just Stevie.
Now this is a great sports article.  Kudos to Julia Poe for her excellent storytelling skill.

Trees highlighted with multicolored red and orange leaves, fields filled with luscious red apples and pumpkins with intricate carvings. The quintessential images of fall resurrect themselves today, the first day of the new season. Although today may not seem different from any other sunny Los Angeles day — it’s incredibly hot and the chances of seeing leaves fall is unlikely anyways — the student body has collectively embraced fall by quite literally “falling” ourselves, in health and wellness. What I’ve found, though, is that a plant-based diet supports a healthy immune system.
The cold bug is rapidly spreading. While the spread of sickness needs to be treated, students’ shared colds can be advantageous to one, in some cases at least. Say you’re in a library and bitterly realize you left your headphones at home. Don’t you worry — your study playlist on Spotify will be copiously replaced by the plethora of sniffles and sneezes coming from the sickly students around you. When you have snifflers surrounding you on all sides, who needs headphones! And I mean come on, if you don’t have a cold yet are you even stressing about school enough? Diminishing your health can serve as a social aid. Don’t know what to talk about? Start the conversation zealously complaining about your cold and everyone will join in! 
So, why is there a trend in weakened immune systems? Well, I don’t know, maybe because we attend a University with intrinsically motivated students who devote their waking and sleeping hours to academia, applying for internships and saving the world (in one way or another). But particularly during this fifth week of the semester, the stress caused by midterms and the overall buildup of courses hasn’t boded well with overly involved overachievers. 
An easy way out of the cold-rut could involve prioritizing sleep over everything and failing your midterms. I propose a solution of moderation. While prioritizing sleep is one of the important components of regaining back your vitality, what you consume need not be neglected. Now, I am no nutritionist, but speaking from personal experience and hours upon hours of research, following a plant-based diet will help you bounce back in record time. 
Here are the cold quelling foods necessary for health restoration: 
Fruits and Veggies — Hello Vitamin C!
Pretty much all fruits and vegetables contain vitamin C, an essential antioxidant for boosting immunity. Fruits and vegetables with high amounts of vitamin C like oranges, mangoes, grapefruit and brussel sprouts. A cup of chopped red bell peppers surprisingly contains “nearly three times more vitamin C than an orange — 190 mg” according to Health.com. Green bell peppers contain a little less vitamin C, but a cup still delivers 200 percent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin C. If you’re on a meal plan, you’re in luck, because the salad bars are always stacked with a multitude of fruits and vegetables. On campus, go produce crazy at the weekly Farmers Market, purchase fresh fruit at Seeds, try vegan friendly salads at Lemonade or the palatable kale salad (usually contains red peppers!) at the Dean’s List Cafe. Off campus, Ralph’s conveniently offers relatively affordable produce. 
Liquids — Stay Hydrated!
Emptying your body of toxins is easy when you’re sipping on juices, smoothies, tea, citrus juices, soups, boba, fruit-infused water,  water and warm lemon juice. While you may rely on coffee to caffeinate, it’s best to avoid this dehydrating drink. You’ll need all the rest you can get, anyways, and that won’t be easy to accomplish when you attempt to sleep with your eyes open. Nekter Juice Bar and the food trucks Amazebowls and Nature’s Brew offer refreshing juices, smoothies, and acai bowls (save for Nature’s Brew). Opt in for kale if this leafy green isn’t already in your drink. Packed with 80.4 mg of vitamin C, twice your recommended daily intake of vitamin A, and seven times the recommended amount of vitamin K, in just one cup kale is sure to save you from your sniffles. Stop by any coffee shop — Starbucks, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and Ground Zero to name a few for green tea (packed with antioxidants), or any other hot, dairy-free drink! Also, The Dean’s List Cafe offers a refreshing thai tea made vegan when ordered with almond or soy milk. 
Anything Spicy — Break A Sweat!
My refrigerator is always loaded with kimchee, spicy chili sauce, red pepper paste, and daikon. Growing up in a semi-Korean household, I learned to relish the uncomfortable experience that comes from sweating from ridiculously spicy food that tantalizes your throat. There are tons of spicy foods available on and off campus at places like Gogi Korean Grill — add spicy cucumber and hot sauce to your order — Chipotle — an animal friendly bowl/burrito topped with pico de gallo and salsa — and Seeds — packaged cucumber avocado rolls with ginger and wasabi. Garlic, onion, jalapeno peppers, ginger are great garnishes for any dish. Sriracha, tapatio and any other hot sauce, and spices, such as coriander and cumin, can easily be implemented into your meal. You can top pretty much anything with sriracha and luckily, the dining halls provide this staple sauce. 
With adequate sleep and nutrition, getting better should be a breeze. You won’t even need to rely on OTC pills, which tend to have negative side effects and may have been tested on animals. Remember that it’s okay to take a break from your responsibilities, and enjoy indulging in what makes you happy. Take a few to meditate, socialize, read a book, listen to music (or sniffles), practice a sport, art form or whatever it is that you’re passionate about!
And who knows, maybe after you conquer your cold, you’ll realize that it isn’t so hard to maintain a plant-based diet.

Brett McGinn has started an unconventional business that offers someone the opportunity to talk to about love, relationships and anything else weighing on your heart. 
Digital dating is integrating itself so quickly into our lives that even Tinder feels old school when compared to the dozens of new hook-up apps polluting your sponsored spaces on Instagram. While one’s next “tinderella” may be one swipe away, there’s a cost to accessibility and immediacy. McGinn himself feels, “people tend to get lazy when they meet digitally. When done through apps, flirting often loses its excitement.” But, despite the baby boomer’s image of millennials as glued to their phones in apathy and laziness, college kids have a lot on their plate. Between getting good grades, finding competitive internships, networking and keeping up on current events like celebrity break ups, we don’t have much time for romance.
In college culture, it’s hard to find a viable candidate for your heart. As students, we’re mostly limited to the USC safety patrol zone for finding bachelors or bachelorettes. And a relationship in college can cost you your friends when they get a little too tired of drunken rants about your significant other. But those problems are the very basis of McGinn’s company. 
“I think there are a sh-tload of people -— generally high school aged –— late 20’s — that find themselves alone, sad and confused when going through a hard time in a relationship,” McGinn said. “They might be above getting a psychiatrist because of the negative connotations that are associated with doing so.” He continues  to state that people might also find themselves in a cycle where they’re annoying the sh-t out of their friends by excessively talking about their frustrations with their love lives. Maybe they have a psychiatrist and a support group and they still want someone else to talk to. 
This isn’t just another love line and you won’t find Brett putting Dr. before his name like Drew, nor is he after a reality TV series for celebrities last seen on TV 10 years ago or a radio show with a constituency of drunken fans awake at 3 a.m. McGinn assures his clients that he’s just a real person who cares. 
As for his own love life, McGinn admits that it’s not fairytale worthy just yet. “Just because I can help you with your relationship problems doesn’t mean I have all of mine figured out,” McGinn said. “As much as I want to find the girl of my dreams and live happily ever after, sometimes love f-cking sucks.” The 26-year-old has been single for almost a decade but don’t count him out of the game. Rather, he’s had the chance to observe and learn for all those years and come out a knowledgeable and caring shoulder to cry on. 
McGinn’s opinion on set payment structures is similar to popular opinion of the split of Brad and Angelina, it sucks. As such, McGinn lets his clients determine how much they pay. Essentially, you can afford love advice heralded by LA Mag and Broken Museum of Relationships AND an Amazebowl, proving paradise does exist.
If one is curious about how a museum can take a stance on a love guru, check it out this Sunday for what McGinn will be meeting with people at the Museum of Broken Relationships for consultations on a first come first served basis on Sept. 25th from 2 to 5 p.m. Anyone that pays for admission into the museum can sit down with him one-on-one and talk to him about their love life, or lack thereof.

ZHU is coming back to his roots. The wildly popular and elusive electronic dance music sensation who got his start as a Trojan will be performing at The Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall on Oct. 12, returning to the part of Los Angeles where he found his voice. 
Born Steven Zhu, the artist graduated in 2014 from the USC Thornton School of Music after spending his four years at USC deeply involved in the music scene on campus, as well as pursuing other interests. A common DJ fixture at events on and around USC, as well as a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity, ZHU was fully committed to his undergraduate experience while also honing his music-making craft. 
Right out of school, ZHU went to work, pursuing his dream of creating EDM. Yet he was wary of the constant thrum of celebrity that surrounds so many artists. Instead of putting out his own image and name to help boost his music, ZHU chose to initially remain anonymous in order to let his music speak for itself. 
By 2014, more three years out of college, ZHU signed a record deal with Mind of a Genius Records/Columbia Records and released his first song, “Moves Like Miss Jackson,” on SoundCloud. The song was a mashup of many Outkast tunes, and ZHU’s anonymous track managed to spark a great deal of excitement in the EDM community. He immediately began to build a loyal following online, and speculation circled around the web as to who produced the track without an artist. 
He released several more tracks on the website while remaining an unknown entity, though he finally decided to reveal himself as ZHU via the EP The Nightday, which included his smash-hit, “Faded.” The song ended up with a Grammy Music Awards nomination for Best Dance Recording, though ZHU worked hard to remain largely anonymous despite the fanfare.
ZHU has never been interested in the trappings of modern celebrity, choosing to remain largely absent on social media and avoid popular culture trends. He rarely tweets, does not Snapchat and is very selective with the promotional interviews in which he will participate. In maintaining the importance of his music over his own image, ZHU has created a cloak of mystery around him. He does not play many concerts, with only 14 shows in 2014 and 2015 combined. In comparison, Disclosure, an artist who many compare ZHU’s sound to, played a 40-date tour in a matter of months. 
ZHU’s ability to land major gigs while keeping a low profile is a testament to his strong fan base. Many USC students saw ZHU perform at Coachella in the Sahara Tent, yet his upcoming performance at The Shrine will be particularly special. Playing at a venue so close to campus, ZHU is excited to return to a place he knows and feels connected to. With the dropping of his debut album, Generationwhy, in July, the concert is sure to be full of fans excited to hear the newest music from such a successful artist. The Trojan Family cannot wait to welcome back a successful, exciting member of our community.

Alejandro RIvera | Daily Trojan
Within the past few months, numerous College Republican chapters have refused to support the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump. According to a recent Inside Higher Ed article, The Harvard Republican Club, Penn State College Republicans and other College Republican organizations have chosen to abstain from endorsing Trump, while other chapters have expressed tacit support, but not endorsement. While Trump supporters who call for party unity may blame College Republican chapters for party fragmentation and accuse them of contempt for the party’s populist base, it is hard to blame these organizations for their hesitation, or in some cases, outright refusal to support him.
As it currently stands, the values of the Republican party seem to be at odds with the values of millennials as a whole. College-age voters are known to support marriage equality, believe in global warming, hold a pro-choice stance, be anti-war and support the decriminalization of marijuana, among a variety of other progressive-leaning social stances. While support for conservative and responsible fiscal policies has always been consistent among most, if not all, members of the Republican party, there seems to have been a split between the Old Guard social conservatives and younger, socially tolerant Republicans.
 Before diving further exploring the exact reasons behind college students’ unfavorable views of Trump, it is important to look to a Republican who was recognized for his favorability among younger constituents, and who could also serve as a model for what Trump isn’t doing to win college-age voters: Sen. Rand Paul. He called for a responsible military budget contrary to many hawkish candidates on the right, an audit of the Federal Reserve, common sense immigration policies, free trade and a progressive drug policy. As a whole, it is  fair to say that Paul’s social stances were much more in line with the Libertarian-leaning stances favored by college-aged Republicans. Paul was the best model Republican the party had at winning the vote of college age voters, holding a persona and worldview Trump certainly does not have. A worldview, as evidenced by Paul’s defeat, that was not in the direction the majority of the party chose to take.
 The largest hurdle in gaining the trust of millennials during this election season is the racist language Trump has encouraged in this election. While racial accusations can seem overly pronounced at times, Trump’s can reasonably be seen as fitting. It is well assumed on many college campuses that Trump is a racist who is unable to sympathize or understand other cultures — notably those of Hispanics and Muslims.       
Whether Trump is or is not in fact a racist is another argument altogether. However, even the idea of appearing as a racist or having associations with racism can lead to widespread rejection by younger voters. With every promise of a wall on the Mexican border, Trump builds a wall between himself and the college-age vote. It would also be safe to assume that calling a growing percentage of voters in this country — Hispanics — all rapists and murderers would also leave a bad taste on the political palate of many young voters.
 Social issues aside, there is perhaps one arena of possible Trump support among college-aged Republicans, however unlikely, to have little effect on college-aged voters as a whole. Fiscal policy for college-age Republican voters is the one place that Trump can make up for his social differences. There has been an argument against Trump’s supposedly protectionist fair-trade policies to help bolster the blue collar American work force. 
However, for the most part, Trump’s economic plan falls in line with conservative fiscal policy and thus fiscal policy almost any Republican would favor. The promises of Trump’s fiscal policies seem to stop at the Republican sphere’s doorstep, however. For most college-aged voters, the importance of fiscal policy and economics does not play a large role in the voting habits of our lives. Because many millennials are not concerned with the national deficit or are often unwilling to comprehend the economic issues out of lack for political interest, they turn to a much more comprehendible arena of political conversation: social issues. 
The sentiment among younger voters is clear; perhaps the Titanic is going down, but at least we will be able to speak out against dangerous “triggerings” and have our safe spaces while the bow plunges below the water line (or more appropriately, the debt ceiling).
 Perhaps after onlookers look behind the Rosie O’Donnell jokes and the “fine businessman” veneer responsible for four bankruptcies, they can start to see the underlying realities that make Trump’s unfavorability factor “huge” among college-age Republicans and even larger among college-age voters in general.

The 2016 presidential election has been somewhat of a challenge for satirical shows like Saturday Night Live — it is nearly impossible to make the antics of this event more ridiculous than they already are. How do you caricature Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who is already so much of a caricature? But humor has still managed to play a critical role in politics this year with varying results. Of course, humor and satire can be useful tools for coping, criticizing and mobilizing. Actress and comedienne Tina Fey’s Sarah Palin impression is often cited as an important factor in delegitimizing Palin’s vice presidential bid. More recently, shows like Last Week Tonight with John Oliver and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee have used humor to critically engage with issues that have plagued the presidential race, from Benghazi to Trump’s wall. The power that comedy has to shape our discourse and debate, however, also gives it the ability to normalize and even perpetuate everything it may seek to critique. 
Humor has played a huge part in the normalization of Trump’s dangerous and unacceptable rhetoric — the most recent example of which is Jimmy Fallon’s Trump interview. Jimmy Fallon is not a journalist. However, this particular segment created a scandal on par with Matt Lauer’s own botched moderation. One image in particular began to make the rounds on Twitter and Facebook — in the photo, Fallon looks gleeful as he musses Trump’s signature hairstyle. It was not only social media users who took offense to the interview. During her talk show, Samantha Bee took Fallon and NBC to task for ignoring how dangerous Trump is. Even Hillary Clinton got in on the joke, handing Fallon a bag of softballs during her interview with him Monday. 
While the problem with Fallon’s interview extends far beyond the hair tousling, the image in which Fallon and Trump appear so buddy-buddy is a perfect encapsulation of the media’s complicity in Trump’s racist, xenophobic and sexist rhetoric. Regardless of how funny we may think Trump’s hair is, we must recognize that his candidacy is no laughing matter. Showing Trump’s “softer” side by asking about his childhood home is not only bad television, it’s a dangerous precedent. From his “Muslim ban” to his labeling Mexicans as “rapists and criminals,” Trump represents the worst of American discourse. It is not enough to hide the normalization of this kind of rhetoric under the guise of comedy. Jimmy Fallon may not have to live up to journalistic standards, but interviewing someone who once refused to disavow support from Ku Klux Klan members is simply irresponsible. 
The 2016 election has been exhausting and seemingly endless, and it only makes sense that people want to seek refuge in humor. However, that humor should not be consumed uncritically. Even the most well-intentioned satire can exacerbate exactly what it seeks to critique. The naked statues of Trump that were installed in cities across America, for example, sank to Trump’s level of bullying by resorting to body-shaming as a mode of political discourse. Comedy has a unique ability to be both accessible and effective in radically challenging our conceptions of the world. It can render deeply held ideologies visible and, therefore, help us to critically analyze them. But pretending that Trump is funny because of his appearance only exacerbates the problem, and allowing Trump’s divisive and toxic rhetoric to go unchallenged only serves to make that behavior seem acceptable. So while Jimmy Fallon chortles with Trump, many of us are simply too scared to laugh.

I think the left should pass legislation on what humor is appropriate.  I mean, why not, the left is already telling us what we are free to talk about and what we cannot, which lecturers can come to speak and which are taboo, so why not have them legislate our humor too.

I turned 20 yesterday — the first birthday I’ve celebrated more than 5,000 miles away from home. It’s also my golden birthday, which means I turned 20 on September 20, and I’ve been lucky enough to celebrate it with friends old and new. 
Scotland is full of constant surprises. This weekend, I took a trip up to Loch Lomond and Oban up in the highlands. Loch Lomond (loch is the Scottish Gaelic word for lake) is an expansive, gorgeous lake sitting in between green mountains on the way from Edinburgh to the Scottish Highlands. With its shores lined with swans and hardly any other humans, the lake defines the Scottish tranquility that seems to pervade the country.
Sonali Seth | Daily Trojan
Besides its natural beauty, which has made it a stop for tourists and locals alike, Loch Lomond was also made famous by a Scottish song called “The Bonnie Banks o’ Loch Lomond” — a fittingly somber tune that speaks to the Scottish national identity. Set in the days of the Jacobite uprising in 1745 (when Scottish Jacobite rebels struggled for control of Scotland from the British monarch), the song features one of two captured Jacobite soldiers who is sentenced to die, while the other is allowed to live. He sings “O ye’ll tak’ the high road, and I’ll tak’ the low road, And I’ll be in Scotland afore ye.” And adding a tinge of sorrow, he adds “But me and my true love will never meet again, On the bonnie, bonnie banks o’ Loch Lomond.” Both exquisitely beautiful and speaking to the Scottish history of centuries of war and anguish, the song is a Scottish staple. It’s also a reminder that every place in Scotland is rooted in so much rich history that shapes the way that people interact with it today.

That’s even more true in Oban, a lush Maine-esque maritime town with delicious fish and chips and the most heavenly Belgian waffle chocolate fondue that has ever graced my lips. Walking along the coastline, it’s easy to stumble upon a few ruined castles dating back to medieval clans or hordes of sheep happily munching on grass. And yet, with its rich history and lush beauty, there are almost no tourists in Oban outside of the city center — which makes it feel like every step is a hidden adventure.
There’s no other place I’d rather ring in my 20’s.

Last year’s law school graduates landed fewer jobs in private practice than any class in the last two decades, according to the National Association for Law Placement, which tracks developments in the legal profession. However, USC Gould School of Law bucked the national trend, placing graduates in private practice well above the national average.
“Nationally, most lawyers work in private firms, which includes smaller and medium sized firms, not just large law firms,” said Elizabeth Armour, associate dean and dean of career services at Gould.
In light of the nationwide decrease, Gould Professor Gillian Hadfield noted that the national move away rom private practice jobs could be a sign of progress rather than one of stagnation.
“I think private practice jobs, particularly in big law firms, are increasingly not attractive or satisfying for new graduates,” Hadfield said. “Nor are they a good stepping-stone to the future. So I don’t see the shifts in employment patterns as signs of trouble, but signs of change, for the better.”
She commented on the changing nature of the legal field as a cause in this shift.
“Law is under a lot of pressure to change,” Hadfield said. “The systems we have now are really too expensive for all kinds of users — ordinary people and businesses. So the traditional ways of doing law are starting to change — some of the jobs law students used to get are, for example, being done through outsourcing or computer technology.”
In the years following the 2008 economic crash, employment for law school graduates steadily declined. However, in 2014, the percentage rose two percentage points, from 84.5 to 86.7 percent, where in remained in 2015.
Overall, 51.3 percent of students graduating in 2015 found jobs in private practice and about 30 percent were employed in public sectors such as the judiciary, military, and public interest organizations. Slightly more than 17 percent found jobs in business. Research shows that the largest employers in recent times have been larger law firms, which consist of 500 or more lawyers. While most job categories have lost positions over the last four years, these large firms have added more than 1,000 jobs.
“There’s still lots of work to be done, but the legal profession is proving slow to respond to connect people and businesses at reasonable cost with legal expertise,” Hadfield said. “Private practice is not an efficient business model for a lot of legal work these days — and I would expect that the law jobs of the future are less likely to be private practice and more likely to involve lawyers working with and for larger-scale businesses that can deliver legal services cost-effectively.”
Despite the job scarcity that arose after the 2008 recession, Armour believes that things have been improving.
“The most robust recovery has occurred in markets outside of Southern California, including in the San Francisco Bay Area and in New York.  Hence here at Gould we are working diligently to educate and encourage our students to look broadly geographically in order to increase their chances of securing a large law firm job,” Armour said.
Aura Gilham, a second year law student at Gould, offered nothing but praise for her experiences so far, highlighting how she is getting many opportunities to explore how law works in the real world, which will enable her to be prepared when she actually enters the field.
“I am absolutely loving law school — it is academically challenging, interesting and redefining. I have been able to participate in the community in ways I otherwise would not have been able to,” Gilham said.
Gilham is currently the managing editor of the Los Angeles Public Interest Law Journal as well as a member of the Southern California Law Review, which she credits to Gould.
“USC Law is an incredible school because it has put me in a strong position for both acquiring and performing well within a legal job.  I worked in the private sector last summer, and I found the analytical skills I learned at USC prepared me extremely well,” Gilham said.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that fewer law school graduates are entering private practice from the Gould School of Law. This was incorrect. Fewer law school graduates nationwide are entering private practice, but Gould has remained above the national average.

The No. 21 USC women’s volleyball team (8-3) open up Pac-12 play against crosstown rival No. 9 UCLA (9-1) Wednesday at the Galen Center.
Emily Smith | Daily TrojanBruins are brewin’ · Freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier and the No. 21 Women of Troy open Pac-12 play with a home match against No. 9 UCLA on Wednesday. The teams are 5-5 in their last 10 meetings.
Both teams have had impressive performances leading up to conference play. USC also started off their conference season against UCLA last season, sweeping the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion.
After starting off this season 0-3, the Women of Troy regrouped and are on an eight-match win streak.
Part of the team’s slow start was because of the influx of new players just before the start of the season. Now, USC has been able to find traction with its youth. Head coach Mick Haley mentioned how the players were able to play effectively in the system following the three-straight losses and cut down tremendously on their errors.
“The biggest thing for these young players is to know that they are going to make errors,” Haley said. “But if you worry about errors, you’re going to make more.”
The Bruins are having a strong start to the season as well. Their only loss was a four-set match against then-ranked No. 15 San Diego; the Toreros are currently ranked No. 7.
Starting off against a highly ranked opponent is nothing new for USC. The Pac-12 is arguably one of the best volleyball conferences in the nation. Haley talked about how there’s no such thing as an easy win in the Pac-12.
“We have a steady diet of ranked teams that we’re going to play in the next two weeks,” Haley said.
The Women of Troy finished their non-conference schedule with two sweeps at home against Oklahoma and Maryland, building good momentum for the road ahead. The team’s win against Maryland was head coach Mick Haley’s 400th win with the program. He now has a 400-98 record at USC.
To say Haley would be used to winning at USC would be an understatement. Winning is what he’s preached to his teams since he came here in 2001.
“We expect to win the national championship,” Haley said. “If you come to USC, those are the expectations.”
Playing at a high enough level to win the championship starts at the conference level. That’s why Haley emphasizes playing tough in the Pac-12 and earning the conference crown as the team’s goal.
“At USC we expect to win the conference every year,” Haley said. “That’s our goal.”
To repeat as conference champions, the Women of Troy will have to start off with a win against their crosstown rivals. USC can look for strong offensive performances from freshman outside hitter Khalia Lanier, sophomore outside hitter Alyse Ford, junior opposite Brittany Abercrombie and junior outside hitter Niki Withers. The four lead the team in kills. Lanier leads the team with 151 kills.
USC can shut down UCLA at the net with strong blocking from senior middle blocker Elise Ruddins, junior middle blocker Jordan Dunn and Abercrombie.
Dunn, who is returning from a back injury that redshirted her last season, has only played in 23 sets this season but is tied with Abercrombie for second on the team with 31 blocks. Ruddins leads the team with 40 blocks. Both Ruddins and Abercrombie have appeared in all 39 sets so far this season.
Last time the Women of Troy and the Bruins met at the Galen Center, UCLA upset top-ranked USC in five sets for their first and only home loss last season.
Haley is excited about getting to open up the season at home.
“Our spectators that come and root us on really help us at our home matches,” Haley said.
The first serve against the Bruins will be at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

At Tuesday night’s Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, representatives of the USG communications and advocacy branches discussed the projects their teams will be working on this year. The senators also passed revisions to the elections code and debated allowing the student body to vote on referendums.
Jessica Zhou | Daily TrojanCode changes · USG Senator Tiffany Lian, pictured here at last week’s Senate meeting, proposed an amendment to the election code on Tuesday.
Senior Director of Communications Luke Southwell-Chan announced the projects the communications branch is currently working on, including a Pac-12-wide weeklong sexual assault awareness campaign. The communications branch will also work to form relationships with local vendors and increase USG’s social media presence.
USG Vice President Austin Dunn and Advocacy Branch Senior Advisor Morgan Monahan introduced the advocacy branch’s goals for the semester, including improving the WiFi and expanding food options in libraries. The projects Dunn will manage personally are active shooter training for students, vaccinations funding, implementing a fall break and working with the Title IX coordinator. In addition to developing new sexual assault prevention initiatives, Dunn said that he would like to refine the role of the Title IX coordinator to maximize her effectiveness.
“The director of Title IX also serves as the director of equity, diversity and inclusion. At every other university, those are separate roles,” Dunn said. “We’re looking into how we can separate those two, because I don’t see how that can be fulfilled by one individual.”
Regarding Senator Sabrina Enriquez’s proposal to allow the general student body to vote on referendums, the Senators suggested several amendments to her proposal but ultimately decided to postpone the vote on the referendum until next week. Senator Daniel Newman proposed limiting the scope of referendums to exclude political issues, and requiring that a majority of the student body pass the referendum. However, Senator Paul Samaha said that it would be difficult to distinguish between issues pertaining to student welfare and to politics, the difference itself being a political question. Matheson also pointed out that requiring a majority vote would be too high of a bar, considering that USC voter turnout has never exceeded 50 percent.
As the debate continued and Lurie moved to postpone the vote until next week, several senators expressed frustration at the delay.
“Sabrina has been talking about this since retreat, and we have had five weeks now where she mentions it every single week,” Samaha said. “We can talk about the specifics of an amendment in the coming weeks, but I don’t think it’s acceptable that some people still don’t know whether they want a referendum at our University or not, because we have had five weeks to talk about this.”
The vote on the referendum proposal was ultimately postponed to next week, with Lurie and Newman stressing that the idea of a referendum was serious and should not be voted upon without refining the specifics of the proposal’s language.

Last fall, USC’s Hispanic population made up 12.5 percent of the entire student body. This year, a larger number of Latino students have been admitted to the University, with William Vela, Director of USC’s El Centro Chicano, and his team predicting a rise in the population to roughly 13 percent.
Photo courtesy of USC Student AffairsHonoring heritage · A mural in El Centro Chicano, USC’s main Latino cultural organization, portrays the rich cultural history of people with a Hispanic background. El Centro plans to host numerous events to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month.
September is National Hispanic Heritage Month, which was founded in 1968 by U.S. Representative Edward R. Roybal and President Lyndon B. Johnson, to recognize the histories, cultures and contributions of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States. The celebration started on Sept. 15, the anniversary of many Latin countries such as Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, and ends on Oct. 15, according to the official National Hispanic Heritage Month website.
“Even though it’s fun to celebrate, it’s more important to really have people get a chance to get a better understanding of us and our issues, but also how they relate to them and how we can work more together,” Vela said. “We really want to help with the learning. Celebrating is just the starting point for us, in the end we want to feed students minds and souls.”
El Centro Chicano’s mission is to inform the campus on ethnic diversity and Latino issues, as well as be a source of advocacy, empowerment and a support system for Latino students. The organization has planned various events to celebrate the National Hispanic Heritage Month. The center kicked-off the month with an event featuring Guatemalan rapper and activist, Rebeca Lane, at Bovard Auditorium on Sept. 13.
Lectures, discussions and events are being held throughout the next few weeks with the goal of spotlighting the Latino community and raising awareness. Sharing information and increasing understanding are focal points for the month.
There are close to 40 different Latino clubs and organizations on campus, and this growing population is looking for ways to feel at home. Cindy Andrade, a sophomore majoring in mathematics and the residential advisor of the Sol y Luna Latino Floor in Fluor Tower, said that she was extremely nervous about first coming to USC, but that the Latino Floor and El Centro Chicano helped her make friends and find comfort.
Current Sol y Luna residents Sonia Chavez-Mesa and Andrea Diaz said that wanting to feel at home influenced their decision to be a part of the Hispanic community at USC.
“Being of Hispanic heritage, I personally always feel alone. It’s nice to find people and a community I feel comfortable with, and to find people with a similar background,” said Chavez-Mesa, an undeclared freshman.
Additionally, the residents emphasized the need to spotlight their community. Diaz stressed the importance of National Hispanic Heritage Month.
“National Hispanic Heritage Month is really important, especially at a place like USC with so much diversity,” said Diaz, a freshman majoring in economics.“You get a sort of culture shock and want to hold onto your own culture. A month like this is really important and helps us show pride in our culture.”
Aside from Rebeca Lane, notable speakers such as Elvis Guzman, and USC Professor and Director of the Tomás Riviera Policy Institute, Roberto Suro, will be hosting discussions over the next few weeks to allow Latino students to talk about issues, concerns and philosophies of the Latino community.
Additionally, El Centro Chicano will host the Student-Faculty Meet and Greet for students on Oct. 13, allowing students to interact with professionals of nearly all communities and establish connections for after their time at USC.
Vela hopes that the events this month will engage all USC students and highlight the values of the Latino community.
“We have so many things to be proud of, so many things to celebrate,” Vela said. “We have such a diverse community. And it’s not just all the countries being spotlighted, because that’s a lot right there, but it’s all the different identities. “

Nick Entin | Daily TrojanRedshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold received his fair share of playing time. Here, he slings one of his seven pass attempts.
Football head coach Clay Helton made sure to emphasize that his original starting quarterback should not be a scapegoat. There are plenty of reasons why the 2016 Trojan football team has not gotten off to the start or shown the potential that it is capable of. USC’s problems include discipline on penalties, focus on missed assignments and an underutilization of all the talent available on the offensive end.
But Helton is right to realize that the struggles on offense all start with the signal caller. The Trojans can and should be the kind of team to compete with playoff contenders, but the team has only put up one touchdown in two games against ranked opponents in Stanford and Alabama. USC is in need of a spark.
Going into the season, picking redshirt junior Max Browne to be the starter seemed to be the safe bet for the season, whereas letting redshirt freshman Sam Darnold start would be more of a short-term risk with a potential long-term benefit. Browne had the experience as a redshirt junior, and while Darnold was the better athlete with more upside, it would make sense to let Browne start now, have Darnold wait for his turn in the future, but still be included in those couple of third down or red zone situations when mobility was of extra importance.
Whether or not the decision to demote Browne and hand over the keys of the offense to Darnold pays off will be unknown until the end of the season. In fact, this isn’t even the end of the quarterback competition that started back in the spring, because Darnold could also hypothetically underperform and prove to be unworthy of keeping the job.
After playing well at times during his limited appearances so far this season, Darnold has earned himself at least a shot. The Trojans weren’t expected to beat either Stanford or Alabama, and a 1-2 record at this point is neither catastrophic nor even surprising. But the offense has definitely underperformed, and Browne has not developed much of a rhythm with his receivers.
Even if there were a touch of forward thinking that went into Helton’s mind when making this decision, giving Darnold the ball just might also be the catalyst toward the divisional or conference championship that should be the expectation for any Trojan team. That is still the standard of this program, even during the years with a freshman quarterback, a first-year coach, an impossible schedule and a below-average start.
The playoff is still a mathematical possibility for a two-loss Pac-12 team. Two losses were enough to keep Stanford out of the playoff last year, despite winning the conference and proving to be far superior over the Big 10’s representative in Iowa in the Rose Bowl, because every other Power Five conference winner had only one loss, making the decision easy enough for the CFP selection committee. Given how awful the Big 12’s start has been, the best of the west should not be the odd team out again this year, especially if there’s one other two-loss conference winner.
Even if this likely won’t be the season the Trojans reach their pinnacle again and it takes Helton more than a season to achieve national power status again, the Trojans absolutely still have something to play for this season. Darnold will almost definitely be the man leading those future USC teams hopefully back toward more consistent and legitimate playoff contention. This experience as a starter should be beneficial to his confidence and development as a quarterback in those future campaigns, and the only thing that would likely stop him from reaching his full potential as a prospect would be if he is hindered by nagging injuries toward the end of his USC career — that was at least the case with Barkley, who played well his first two seasons, catapulted onto Heisman watch lists after a breakout junior season, but fell well short of expectations as a senior and missed his final game because of a shoulder problem.
For the sake of winning the South Division now, the move might not be worth it. Even with a less-than-phenomenal game manager rather than game changer QB in Browne, I still think this current team is better than UCLA, better than Utah, and is still the favorite to defend its division title. Even with the tiny sample against Stanford, Darnold seems more vulnerable to throw the costly interception in a big moment against a tough conference opponent than Browne does.
At this point in the season, though, seeing what kind of additional upside Darnold has as a starter is worth it. His couple of series showed that he can bring the same accuracy and poise that Browne had with a little more athleticism and versatility.
Either way, if Darnold succeeds and keeps the job, or Helton goes back to Browne again, the Trojan season is far from over. What really matters for the Trojans is divisional play, and the Trojans have an above average shot at finishing the next five conference games without a loss, which would put them at 6-2 going into a matchup with Oregon. The test on Friday against Utah will obviously be crucial, and the Trojans aren’t where they want to be, but they’re not that far off from where they need to be.

Amid rumors of locker room altercations and behind-the-scene tension, the Trojans took to practice on Tuesday to look toward this weekend’s trip to Utah. With clouds building overhead, the mood on the field was intense and focused. Head coach Clay Helton closed out practice with a heated speech, reminding his players that overcoming adversity and loss is just another part of playing football.
Brian Chin | Daily TrojanHelton’s hot takes · First-year head coach Clay Helton continues to struggle with off-the-field distractions. On Tuesday, internet rumors of a locker room altercation quickly spread before being put to rest at practice.
This weekend’s matchup could provide relief for a USC team struggling to rebound from two early losses against Alabama and Stanford. Although Utah boasts a 3-0 record, those wins came against Southern Utah, San Jose State and an unranked BYU squad that has struggled early this season.
Between lineup changes and a homecoming for a new USC defensive starter, this weekend will be defining for the rest of the Trojans’ season.
E.J. Price did not punch Clay Helton
In a powerful example of the sway of internet rumors, Helton was forced to address questions on Tuesday about the sudden departure of true freshman offensive tackle E.J. Price. Helton confirmed that Price will be leaving the team and transferring from USC. But he waved off the rumor that Price took a swing at his head coach in the locker room earlier today.
“I got told today about him hitting me,” Helton said with a laugh. “I wouldn’t be here. I’d be dead.”
Instead, Price is leaving USC in the wake of personal family issues. Helton said that Price has been suffering from homesickness and living far from his family throughout this season. Both agreed that the best choice for the freshman is to find a college closer to his family.
“This is a really good kid,” Helton said. “He’s going to be a really good college football player. I wish him nothing but the absolute best. He’s been a member of my family.”
Helton stands behind quarterback change
A day after announcing the decision to start redshirt freshman Sam Darnold over redshirt junior Max Browne, Helton remained firm in his decision. Although he applauded Browne’s effort and attitude throughout the season, he feels that Darnold will give the offense the shot of adrenaline it needs to get back on track towards a winning record.
“He’s not the reason we’re 1-2,” Helton said. “The kid’s a great kid and he’s a competitor. But you have to make hard decisions. You have to do what you feel is best for the team.”
Helton cited Darnold’s arm strength and ability to anticipate plays as two of his main reasons for picking the freshman to start against Utah. Coming off the bench, Darnold has been effective in producing points and moving the ball efficiently. After practice, Helton said that he is not only very confident with Darnold, but also focused on praising Browne’s leadership and tact in handling the transition to the back-up position.
“I’m so proud of the guy,” Helton said. “His demeanor to his leadership to how he’s practicing, how he’s continuing to compete. That’s why he’s got the ‘C’ on his jersey. He’s shown true leadership in how he’s handled it.”

Often I wonder, if I had gone to a different school, would I still resemble the person I am now? Only recently did I realize that the answer would be no. My time at the film school, although not perfect, has definitely impacted my path to becoming a filmmaker, and that in part has to do with the short film class I took during the spring semester of my sophomore year.
As students, we were tasked with writing, shooting and editing three short films over the course of two months. Prior to this class I had never picked up a film camera, believing my passion was in writing and writing only. However, immersing myself so completely in production opened up an entirely new world of possibilities for me. I realized not only my knack for writing but also for directing, and I liked it.
Inspired by my experience during the spring of sophomore year, I embarked on writing and directing another short film that summer — this time with a full crew, partially composed of SCA students — in the hopes of making something that felt more in touch with the genre I was interested in. That experience was not only life changing but also beyond encouraging. It opened me up to the world of short films and the beauty of a medium that valued concise storytelling over everything else.
Regular readers of this column will know that by the time of this article’s publication, I will be a day away from shooting another sci-fi short film, this time set on my family’s berry farm in Oregon. The road to making this short film has been filled with its own set of challenges, from creative constraints based on funding to weather problems and problematic scheduling. It’s been quite a long, intense and exhausting three months of preparation and pre-production. Because of the filming location and the intricate details of the script, I had to fly from Los Angeles to Portland a week before shooting in order to finalize all the extra details and get ready for the entire crew to arrive on Thursday. Therefore, I’ve had to take time off from school.
Knowing the shoot date for a month in advance, I’ve had time to share this information with my professors and TAs, alerting them ahead of time that I would be out of school for a week. Of course, in the beginning of the year every student is made well aware that a sickness or a family emergency are the only acceptable reasons that excuses the absence. Knowing this, I prefaced each one of my professors or TAs with all the information that I had about the legitimacy of my shoot.
At my performing arts high school, I often skipped class under the ruse that I was “practicing for a play” — more often than not, I was just hanging out with my friends in the orchestra pit before lunch time. This time around, I’m not making up some flimsy excuse to ditch class and hang out. The short is meant to be a viable investment in my future as a filmmaker in Hollywood, in much the same way as gaining a degree from the USC School of Cinematic Arts.
And so it came as a bit of a surprise when I received responses from my teachers who informed me that my weeklong absence to shoot my short could not and would not be considered an excused absence.
Though I know my grade won’t truly suffer in the long run for skipping this week, I was a little shocked. Shouldn’t the No. 1 film school in the world — with aims to make the most opportunities for their students — want to encourage the creativity and productivity of their students as much as possible?
After all, if its alumni are successful, it should have no qualms of touting its pedigree across high school and campus literature. The school should make special aims to encourage their students to succeed in as many ways possible instead of almost punishing a student for having the initiative and drive to complete projects as a supplement to her education.
I don’t mean this to complain about my circumstances — as I’ve said before, I wouldn’t be where I am today without SCA, but I do know that not every school is perfect, and in this area the film school definitely has room for improvement.

She stepped on stage with her guitar and looked out at the crowd of students in the Ground Zero Performance Cafe. McCall Kimball, a freshman majoring in popular music, smiled at the crowd and introduced herself under her stage name, McCall. The bright lights were aimed at her feet and the faces were hidden behind shadows. She saw glimpses of eyes staring at her. She strapped the guitar over her shoulder and stepped closer to the microphone. This wasn’t her first performance in front of curious eyes.
Photo courtesy of McCall KimballMusic is her calling · McCall released her second EP Everything Means Nothing on Wednesday. The EP will feature pop and EDM sounds.
McCall performed her first original song, “Missin’ You Blues,”  in fourth grade. She memorized three guitar chords and wrote the blues song for her music class. Although it wasn’t her best song, it was the song that sparked the beginning of her music career.
McCall released her first EP, Can’t Keep Waiting, at  15. More recently, she released a single, “I Thought I Warned You,” from her upcoming EP. Her new EP Everything Means Nothing was released Wednesday on iTunes.
McCall’s music transformed into a new sound after her first EP. In the years between the two EPs, she saw herself becoming an EDM artist, which contrasted with her original blues-oriented sound. EDM was something new that she wanted to venture into, but McCall couldn’t see herself letting go of the blues. The sound of a bluesy electric guitar accompanied with a raw vocal performance resonated with her more than EDM. She couldn’t let go of what initially attracted her to music. Instead, she integrated her new interests into her upcoming album.
“This is a very produced EP, and it’s kind of a snippet of everything I like,” McCall said. “There’s very heavy pop influences, blues influences and a very strong EDM presence. It’s kind of like an umbrella of everything I like. The exciting part about it is that no track sounds the same.”
Although her sound is constantly changing and growing, McCall’s songwriting methods remain the same. She began writing her music through poems and melodies. When she learned how to play guitar, her songwriting gained momentum. McCall got comfortable with songwriting and developed her own habits of writing. She wrote her songs by beginning with a chord progression, singing over them to develop the lyrics, then letting the words naturally flow out of her. As a songwriter, she felt that setting time aside for writing helped songwriters define their craft.
“I definitely do set myself a 9 to 5 when it comes to songwriting,” McCall said. “But those songs are never really that good. They’re just practice for when the emotion does come and we can write that song — a good song that does mean something to you. Then it’s so much better than it would’ve been.”
She realized she could have a career as a singer-songwriter in eighth grade when she performed one of her original songs at a chorus concert. She stood on the stage at the concert and sang her song, “Sticks and Stones.” Her anti-bullying anthem hummed to the audience, much like all performances that followed.
The subject matter of McCall’s music soon shifted to relationships and the people around her as she got older. She adapted the situations from actual experiences as well as fabricated ones. She occasionally exaggerated relationships to achieve the sound and story of her music as well. Beyond the love songs, McCall wrote about anything that influenced her, including people she found online.
“I wrote ‘Cigarettes and Polaroids’ because I followed this girl on Instagram, and I thought she was so cool,” McCall said.  “So I wrote a song about what I thought her life was probably like. In every picture on Instagram she’s smoking a cigarette or it looks like a polaroid.”
Similarly, McCall’s upcoming EP includes music that ranges from a variety of styles and stories. Her first song on the EP, “Crystal,” is a traditional blues storytelling song. She loved the idea of writing something dark and tragic, so she explored the genre and wrote “Crystal.” “I Thought I Warned Ya,” the single to her EP, is a song with pop and EDM influences about a cheating boyfriend. “Waysexydown,” her third song, is about getting together with someone. The final song on the album is an acoustic of Crystal. The EP titled Everything Means Nothing documents McCall’s transition in her music.
“I’m trying to figure out who I am as an artist and what my real sound is,” she said. “It’s a stressful time, and I’m trying to not take everything so seriously and take it as a journey.”
Her artistic influences that have helped her develop her voice include both blues and rock artists. McCall looks up to a lot of female blues artists with strong belting abilities such as Big Momma Thornton and Janis Joplin.
More recently, ZZ Ward has been a large influence on her music and vocal style. McCall was amazed by Ward’s live performances and found her relatable personality admirable. Her love for music was fostered by these discoveries. Furthermore, she looks forward to cultivating her passion for performing.
“I came to USC because there aren’t that many contemporary music programs in the country,” McCall said. “USC is, out of the very few that there are, very performance-based. It outweighs every other program with its emphasis on performance. If we come here, we become performing artists.”
McCall sees her career leading to even more stages and larger audiences. She hopes to tour one day and connect with her fans through her music. In the audience, she imagines her fans fostering a cultural community at her concerts. To McCall, music is more than just a noun. It is a powerful common ground. Everyone in the audience enjoys music because they are able to relate to it. Music cultivates and invokes the wide range of emotions people have. It is McCall’s goal to fulfill music’s purpose and power with her songs.
“Having the opportunity to create that kind of experience with somebody is so magical and powerful to me,” McCall said. “They’ll be able to feel through my words and see parts of their life in my songs.”

Critically acclaimed jazz saxophonist and bandleader Kamasi Washington visited USC’s campus for a performance and conversation about his music and upbringing in South Los Angeles Tuesday night in Bovard Auditorium.
Gerald Aguilar | Daily TrojanEpic tunes · Kamasi Washington and his band (above) played a small show Tuesday night at Bovard Auditorium. The event was hosted by the USC Vision and Voices and was very well recieved by the audience. The live band played songs from Washington’s album The Epic.
Washington has been an Angeleno since birth. Born and raised in Inglewood, where he still resides, Washington has appeared on tracks by artists such as Flying Lotus, Nas, Lauryn Hill and Kendrick Lamar over the course of his career — including significant contributions to Lamar’s critically acclaimed 2015 album To Pimp a Butterfly. Washington’s own solo project, 2015’s three-part jazz opus The Epic, was similarly praised, and was ranked 10th by Pitchfork on its list of “The 50 Best Albums of 2015.”
Washington followed that album up with an inspired performance at the 2016 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Annual Festival where he, as Billboard described it, “won over a growing crowd at the outdoor theater without compromising any sort of jazz roots, nailing afro-funk stops, bebop melodies, and high-flying solos from bassists, turntablists, and dueling drummers in a lesson in musicality.”
A graduate of UCLA’s Department of Ethnomusicology, Washington is currently signed to Los Angeles independent label Brainfeeder, which hosts other L.A.-based jazz and avant-garde artists such as Flying Lotus, experimental hip hop group Shabazz Palaces and jazz fusion bassist Stephen “Thundercat” Bruner.
The event, which was hosted by USC Visions & Voices and co-sponsored by the Black Student Assembly, began with a performance from Washington and his live band. Washington, whose work often skips between genres so rapidly and frequently that it could almost be called “genreless,” deftly balanced elements of jazz, soul, funk and R&B throughout his set.
A discussion led by Josh Kun, a professor of communication at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and the director of The Popular Music Project at Annenberg’s Norman Lear Center followed Washington’s performance.
The conversation mainly focused on the role music played in helping him escape gang life in South L.A.
Washington’s performance was praised by both the members of the audience and the people who helped organized the event. Nadja Barlea, one of the student coordinators for Vision and Voices, said that she was pleased to to see how Washington generated buzz on campus.
“What I was surprised about was how many people are super excited about the chance to see a jazz sax player,” Barlea said. “Kamasi’s brother is a grad student and his entire class is coming, so many music students are coming with their friends, so many musicians are here. It’s cool to see so many people come out for someone who’s not strictly mainstream.”
Kamasi Washington’s next live performance in Los Angeles will be at the Walt Disney Concert Hall on Nov. 6.
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Kamasi Washington was pictured in the photo that ran with this story. It was members of his band, not Washington. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The Unruh Institute of Politics hosted a panel discussion which explored the importance of diversity, demography and race in the 2016 election on Tuesday evening at Ground Zero. Moderator Dan Schnur described this demography as the “new electorate,” capable of altering the voting trends of the election. The panel featured Mike Madrid of public affairs firm Grassroots Lab, USC Professor of Political Science Robert Shrum, Daily Trojan News Assignments Editor Raz Nakhlawi and Jasmin Tuffaha, producer for KPCC’s Airtalk with Larry Mantle.
Schnur sparked the discussion with a question about the generational component of this election, as many millennials from different communities are influencing the political process like never before. Particularly within the Democratic Party, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton struggled to connect with young voters in the primaries and Schnur questioned how she could do this in the general election. 
“Clinton is in a relatively strong position despite her personal unfavorability because [Republican presidential nominee Donald] Trump is in a demographic cul-de-sac,” Shrum said. “[African Americans will] overwhelmingly vote for Clinton and the President will put huge efforts into getting them out.” 
For Tuffaha, Trump challenges the notion of “third-rail politics,” or issues so controversial and politically charged that any politician who touches upon them will suffer. 
“The reason a guy like Donald Trump is so popular is because he is talking about things that we used to not be able to talk about on a national scale,” Tuffaha said.
Tuffaha highlighted the importance of the presidential debate taking place on Sep. 26, as it will be the first of the series of debates and may sway many undecided voters, which currently make up 10 to 13 percent of the electorate, according to Tuffaha 
Shrum recommended that Clinton attempt to reveal something of herself in the debate and show some personality in order to combat criticism of her aloof demeanor. He added that she will already win on substance. 
The conversation then turned to racial issues and minority voters. 
“There is a very significant break generationally, as Latino millennials by staggering numbers voted for Bernie Sanders in the primary, but meanwhile what you saw was older Baby Boomers and Generation Xers overwhelmingly voting for Clinton,” Madrid said. 
This trend is very much based on the vastly different society millennials live in, compared to their parents and grandparents, according to Madrid. Because of these demographic changes and the growing number of young Latinos in California, Madrid said that the Latino vote in California is essentially synonymous with the millennial vote.
“Millennials do not view race as a construct in the same way people over the age of 35 do because they have grown up in a far more diverse society and interact with far more people of far more different backgrounds far more often, and these interactions change how they perceive race and gender,” Madrid said. 
The panelists also discussed the impact of growing Islamophobic sentiment on the election, particularly when it came to candidate statements supporting or denouncing past U.S. actions in the Middle East. For Shrum, Islamophobia is a tool used by the candidates rather than a deciding factor in the election. 
“Islamophobia was one of the keys to Trump getting the Republican nomination, but it is one of his big problems in the general election,” Shrum said. “I’d give the American people more credit that to think they identify an entire religion with terrorism.”
