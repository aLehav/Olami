Throughout his educational journey, Jesse Wang has always seen himself as an underdog. He’s held this view since the 10th grade when he transferred to a private school where the curriculum was dense and demanding. Although he struggled at first, Wang was able to cultivate a strong work ethic and routine in order to successfully gain admission to Emory University’s undergraduate program. When he began attending the USC Gould School of Law for his Juris Doctorate degree, he found himself in the same predicament as he did many years before at private school, where he didn’t do as well as he had hoped. 
Wang, a graduate student studying law at Gould and business at the Marshall School of Business, said this experience made him very despondent, where he doubted his future in the legal field. Rather than giving up, he worked harder in law school and wrote a book titled “Underdog: 12 Inspirational Stories for the Despondent Law Student” to let his peers know that they are not alone. 
“I wanted to be able to inspire people who were either contemplating law school or were in law school and didn’t have the grades that they thought were necessary to become a good lawyer or successful attorney,” Wang said. “I wanted to write something that would have helped me if I were a [first year] going through the struggle.”
Throughout his book, Wang incorporated 12 anecdotes about the struggles of USC Law students, faculty and alumni and how they overcame their problems. According to Wang, including specific and diverse perspectives was necessary as he wanted the book to be reflective of USC’s law school so readers would hopefully relate to at least one chapter. The cover of “Underdog” features a building with 12 windows, each representative of the short anecdotes Wang wrote. In his book, he takes a tone that is both inspirational yet satirical.
“I wanted it to be representative of the legal community,” Wang said. “I wanted everyone to be a part of the story because everyone is [and] because this isn’t about just one type of person or one quality, it’s about the discipline of law students. And that transcends any type of categorical barrier that we may think, either consciously or subconsciously in the law school, we’re all in the same boat.”
Following his first year of law school, Wang began writing “Underdog” in October 2019 shortly after Eric Koester, a professor at Georgetown University, reached out to him over Linkedin about potentially writing a book. Wang, who was looking for ways to diversify himself as a law student, welcomed the venture so that he could share the struggles of law school. 
After interviewing 12 law students, alumni and faculty, Wang used the crowdfunding website Indiegogo to raise $5,000 from the USC community to publish his book professionally. Following months of marketing, editing and book cover designing, “Underdog” was released Dec. 7 and quickly became the number one bestseller on multiple Amazon category lists.
Passionate about helping the underserved and low income communities in the Los Angeles area, Wang elected to donate all his book proceeds to the USC Gould Public Interest Law Foundation and the Small Business Clinic to help small businesses affected by the global pandemic.
“I just felt like this is really not the time to make a personal profit off of this project, especially when the book is about the school — It’s about the community,” Wang said. “I felt like it was important for all of us to really come together and support the vulnerable people, the underdogs of L.A. The Small Business clinic helps an incredible number of minority-owned and women- led small businesses in the Los Angeles area.” 
Gabrielle Rodrigues, a third year law student at USC and a friend of Wang’s, is mentioned in one of “Underdog’s” anecdotal chapters which discuss the importance of prioritizing mental health in law school. According to Rodrigues, law students often experience high rates of depression due to the grading curve, high pressure work and not performing as well as they did during their undergraduate program.
“[On] our first day of orientation, the law school gave us this presentation, and the very first slide told us how people who go to law school have much higher rates of experiencing … mental health issues,” Rodrigues said. “When they told us that, it was definitely startling, but nobody really told us how to take care of yourself. I think that this book, just largely, is very much focused on trying to instill that kind of mindset in people that are considering going to law school, because I just don’t think it’s a conversation that’s mostly had.”
Rodrigues also said that the way Wang’s story contextualizes law school by incorporating 12 diverse experiences, backgrounds and challenges allows the reader to relate to at least one of the anecdotes and reaffirm that they are not alone.
Dorna Moini, a lecturer in law at USC Gould, is also featured in a chapter of “Underdog.” In this chapter, Wang writes about his experience in Moini’s “Legal Innovations Lab” course and the way her company, Documate, has influenced his future aspirations in law. 
As a USC Gould alum, Moini said many law students have high achieving personalities who were often at the top of their class during their undergraduate career. Law school, however, can be different, leading them to doubt their decision.
“Entering the law school environment, you’re met with a lot of diversity in terms of skills and interests,” Moini said. “A lot of what Jessie focuses on in that book is how to take things that you think may be your weaknesses, find where your strengths lie, and make a career or a lifestyle out of it and enjoy the way that you practice law.”
Following the success of “Underdog,” Wang said he is writing his second novel which will expand the topic of perseverance to deal with concepts of antifragility among the Marshall community. According to Wang, this sequel will feature stories of business students, alumni and faculty who have endured chaos or struggles and become stronger for it as an inspiration for the next generation of business students. 
“I want the main message for people who are going through any type of hardship, whether it’s law school, graduate school, medical school, undergrad — is that grades do not define who you are,” Wang said. “Success is not defined by your transcript. Success is defined by small wins over a long period of time. It’s about having a singular goal in mind that you chase down with every ounce of your being.”

As Jorgel Chavez begins another semester of online learning at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy, he faces a new challenge far different from readjusting to Zoom classes and speaking with prospective students as a Price student ambassador: governing the people of Bell Gardens.
In November, Chavez won the election for Councilmember of Bell Gardens by a margin of 899 votes. He successfully ran against four challengers for two seats, including 21-year incumbent Pedro Aceituno.  
Chavez, who didn’t make any promises throughout his grassroots campaign, told constituents that “I’m not the trustee, I’m the delegate.” His campaign platform looked to tackle homelessness and community safety while maintaining transparency throughout the process.
It wasn’t long until Chavez’s platform and ideas made him a serious contender in the race, catching the attention of not only his supporters but other candidates and adversaries. Various attack ads against him were issued including mail advertisements calling him a “puppet.”
He received additional comments attempting to delegitimize his run for office, including people stating Chavez was “just a student” and questioning his experience. Chavez often chose not to engage with defamatory comments, instead inviting those challenging his platform to a “civil conversation.”
“I did have my fair share of attacks, even to jeopardize my character,” Chavez said. “At the end of the day, I ran by myself. I still stick by that, and I think our campaign made a huge statement.”
Running without a chief of staff or spokesperson, Chavez often worked with his Spanish-speaking mother, his 15-year-old cousin, and a few volunteers to canvas the neighborhood in hopes of gaining support.  
“My cousin had helped me out a lot in my campaign … I’m trying to be a role model to him and [tell] him that there’s a lot of work to be done, and I can’t do it all on my own,” Chavez said. “He got a good amount of experience … knocking on doors and stuff, and I think he’s really interested in this.”
Chavez also relied on a small professional network. He wrote to professional contacts that had accumulated in a “big stack of business cards”he’d collected over the years, and also reached out to other elected officials and even professors for help and endorsements. Some donors offered up to $500.
Much of Chavez’s $6,600 fundraising total was directed towards promotional materials. Because the campaign was run from his home and supported by volunteer efforts, no funds were directed to campaign offices or staffers. 
Chavez often skateboarded with the promotional materials, up and down the streets of Bell Gardens. The materials — often just half-sheets of printer paper — would feature his personal cell phone number for constituents to call and discuss issues with him directly.
Canvassing from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. and then 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m., Chavez spent the middle of the day taking classes, including Professor of Public Policy Grace Bahng’s “Foundations of Policy Analysis.”
Chavez shared news about his campaign early on with Bahng’s class and would often converse with Bahng during office hours about the state of the race. 
“This is sort of why we do what we do,” Bahng said. “It’s our privilege to walk with students who have ambitions to engage in public policy and create positive change for their communities”
Chavez’s passion for policy and government predates his tenure at USC. He has shown an interest in politics for years, especially during his time at Bell Gardens High School, where he graduated in 2015.
Chavez often worked with Jeff Harris, former CEO of The Junior State of America Foundation, throughout high school. Harris quickly came to pick up on the integrity and empathy Chavez showed as a young leader.
“He has always been someone who wanted to give back, to serve his community,” Harris said. “[He’s] always been really involved and interested in public affairs. I was really excited when he called me and told me that he had decided to run. It just seemed like a natural [fit] for him.”
Rounding out the campaign, Chavez spent the entirety of election day at the polls, particularly those at his alma mater, Bell Gardens High School. His mother and cousin were stationed at the other two polling stations at Veteran’s Park and Dell Records. 
“People are lined up and they’re saying ‘Oh, I’m here to vote for you, I’m here to vote for you.’ and I still don’t believe it,” Chavez said. “I’m obviously concerned about what’s going on in national politics and seeing how Joe Biden’s doing … but I was also very concerned about my own election.”
Following his win, Chavez said the realization that he would “serve as a council member every day” finally set in. Two week’s into the job, he said he has recognized the amount of work that needs to be done.
With the new Biden Administration, Chavez said he is hopeful for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants residing within the United States and in Bell Gardens. Chavez also hopes for improved relationships among constituents, the Department of Homeland Security and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. According to the United States Census Bureau, 42.1% of the population of Bell Gardens identified as foreign-born in July 2019. 
Chavez also noted additional concerns regarding access to coronavirus resources in the southeast Los Angeles region and hopes for more of a say in vaccine rollout. When it comes to crucial issues like coronavirus testing, Chavez said he is tired of Bell Gardens being “seen as the backyard of the county.” 
“I think among the southeast L.A. region, we’ve been neglected,” Chavez said. “I think we need more support. I think we need more resources.”
Having since assumed his seat on the city council, Chavez said he is holding himself to a renewed “sense of responsibility to open the door and pathway for others to get involved.”
“I’m literally sitting down in my office as I speak,” Chavez said. “I have a Mexican flag in my office, I have a U.S. flag, I have the California flag, I have the USC flag and soon to be the [Los Angeles Football Club] flag … I’m just like ‘Wow, I’m just blessed to be here, I’m blessed to have the certificate that said I got elected.’”

As USC begins its third semester of online learning, many students are gradually adjusting to life and studies on a virtual campus. However, for students participating in classes asynchronously, there are still many obstacles to overcome, especially when it comes to class participation and in-class assignments. As more professors encourage student interactions within the class, asynchronous learning is becoming less flexible than it seems. 
Asynchronous classes were established to improve the online learning experience for students currently living overseas in different time zones. According to USC’s “Policy and Guidelines for Asynchronous Learning,” students taking classes that fall outside the 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. time range in their region can opt to receive asynchronous learning accommodations. This means that students can watch recordings of the class instead of participating in the live session. Asynchronous learning is especially helpful to international students. During the fall semester, USC had over 4,000 students studying from other countries, and a majority were from Asia, which is 11 to 17 hours ahead of the Pacific Time Zone and does not use Daylight Savings Time. To attend live classes, these students would need to stay up all night. In light of these clear challenges, asynchronous learning helps international students find a balance between their lives and studies.
However, asynchronous accommodations still have limitations. Some students find that their choice of classes has been significantly limited when they cannot attend live sessions. Some classes make it clear that they require student attendance and in-class participation no matter what time zone students are in, often because of class activities such as group projects and class debates. 
Participation in these activities is often counted towards final grades. In order to cope with these situations, some asynchronous students switch classes until they find one that happens at a reasonable time or allows fully asynchronous study. This process adds on more stress, negatively affecting their learning experience. Meanwhile, other students choose to stay up late and take classes after 11 p.m. or attend classes that occur as early as 3 a.m. in their time zone. 
If this were to take place on a daily basis, it would not only decrease student efficiency, but also disturb the wake-sleep cycle and disrupt the body’s biological rhythm, which would be detrimental to physical and mental health. Both cases reflect the need for better accommodations to help asynchronous students have better and healthier learning experiences this semester.
There are many viable ways for classes to better accommodate students. Classes that require in-class participation can consider having a discussion board on Blackboard. This enables asynchronous students to share their thoughts and ideas after the live session has ended to receive credit. In the meantime, asynchronous students can also be arranged into separate groups based on their time zone and meet outside of class to work on group debates, speeches and other collaborative assignments. Students can record these activities and submit them to their professors.
Some professors may worry that asynchronous students will not watch the recorded videos. This can be solved by having asynchronous students answer questions about the content on the discussion board or send in answers to a prompt that is given in class.
For courses that require attendance for lab or discussion sections, the time of these sections should be varied to accommodate asynchronous students. Although this is difficult for small classes, larger classes may consider opening new sections when a significant number of students are international. Additionally, courses should indicate if they do not recommend asynchronous learning on the web registration page. This will help asynchronous students find the appropriate classes more easily during registration.
Remote learning can be difficult, and learning from a different time zone makes it even more challenging for students. It is imperative for the University to improve the asynchronous learning experience of its international students by providing them with better learning accommodations.

Over the last year, as the coronavirus spread around the world, many individuals were able to confine themselves in their homes as a safety measure. In prisons across the United States however, thousands of incarcerated men and women were not as privileged. Instead, they were subjected to careless staff as well as communal bath, dining and sleeping areas. 
In California state prisons, men and women behind bars have a one in five chance of contracting the coronavirus, which now totals 2,222 active cases and 46,728 cumulative cases at the time of publication.
With visitation canceled and an absence of furlough leave, men and women behind bars are isolated from the rest of the world. Prisons should have been one of the most exempt places in the world when it came to the spread of the coronavirus because inmates are contained in their dorms and contact is restricted amongst themselves. 
However, during the initial spread of the coronavirus to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation during the week of March 22, the California prison system experienced a startling 300% positivity rate and a 375% positivity the following week. By the end of that month, there were over 8,000 cases; and by April, there were over 50,000 cases in California prisons alone. Some of the California prisons with the highest number of cases include San Quentin State Prison, Avenal State Prison, Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and CA Men’s Colony. 
Since mid-December, inmates under the care of the CDCR have experienced a somewhat steady decrease of coronavirus cases, which are lowering by the hundreds each week. 
In addition to the thousands of incarcerated men and women who have contracted the coronavirus, there are 1,321 active cases among CDCR staff. 
Correctional officers are notorious for smuggling in cell phones, drugs and other illegal contraband that they distribute to prisoners without permission. After a recent surge of coronavirus cases within prisons, it is apparent that some officers also brought in the virus. With the lack of mobility and contact with the outside world among inmates, it becomes clear that the pandemic’s presence in California prisons can be traced back to CDCR staff, who are able to enter and leave the premises at will. 
The CDCR spends hundreds of thousands of dollars securing their perimeter by setting their prison locations in a remote area, incorporating hundreds of layers of gates and setting up frequent officer-run checkpoints to prevent any misconduct by the inmates. During the 2020-21 fiscal year, Gov. Gavin Newsom allowed for a budget of $21.6 million to expand video surveillance and $21.4 million for staff development and new training in some California prisons.
However, what is the point of a 40-foot fence topped with barbed wire and a guard posted at a tower at all times if they can’t even contain a virus brought in from the outside? Some CDCR workers refused to wear masks on prison premises, and others failed to follow stay-at-home orders. There seems to be a lack of regulations to keep  staff in their place.
Correctional officers’ careless behavior during the pandemic demonstrates their abundance of privilege and lack of regard toward inmates’ lives. Out of over 15,000 cumulative coronavirus cases in CDCR staff, some may have been accidental or the result of symptoms going unrecognized. However, staff should still be held accountable.
Additionally, some prisons did not allow incarcerated men and women to wear masks because they believed it would conceal their face, giving them anonymity that would allow them to get away with more crime. Prisons seem to care more about taking precautions against possible crime and believing the worst in people behind bars than taking measures to preserve their safety. 
The CDCR has allowed 191 incarcerated men and women to die from the coronavirus in their care. Incarcerated people are not obsolete. They still grow old, fatigued and fall ill. But unlike the general population in the U.S., these inmates are unable to shelter in place and protect themselves when everything in prison is shared in such close quarters. With such dangerous living conditions and the inability to take proper precautions, sentences that would have eventually been lifted have unintentionally become death sentences. 
On Dec. 22, the CDCR began administering the vaccine to staff and high-risk inmates with the intent to eventually offer the vaccine to the entire California prison population in three phases. To allow incarcerated men and women the opportunity to keep ties with their family during the pandemic, the CDCR has also implemented 30-minute video visits using Cisco Webex once a month for eligible inmates.
However, the efforts that have been made by the CDCR does not remedy the fact that 14 times more people have died from the coronavirus in their care than those executed by the death penalty in California since 1976. Nationwide, there have been over 2,200 incarcerated men and women who have died from the coronavirus, making California the fourth largest jurisdiction responsible for these deaths.
There is a lot that we can do as scholars, activists and simply just people on the other side of the fence. The most important thing we can do is to change the lens through which people see incarcerated citizens. We live in a time period where mass incarceration is at its peak, and with that comes mass criminalization. Prisons are not composed of deviants the way we are led to believe; instead, incarcerated men and women are people who live and work together as a community. They share triumphs and laughs, hardships and despair, just as any community does together. 
Incarcerated men and women need allies because they have neither the platform nor connections to advocate for themselves. Inmates must be provided with the appropriate protection, health care and policies that will best support their lives. Crowded dormitories, poor ventilation, few medical checkups as well as shared dining and bathing areas are a recipe for the spread of a deadly virus.
We can support incarcerated men and women by listening to what they need and holding the criminal justice system accountable for the times that it fails them. We can expand awareness to make sure that their voices and their needs are heard. In prisons, there are men and women who are serving wrongful or unfair punishments or trying to make up for the damage they have done. We need to give them a place in our society, rather than carelessly neglecting them and their everyday struggles. 
If we want the CDCR and the greater criminal justice system to do better, then we, too, have to do better leading by example and show them that the lives of incarcerated people matter.

Mold is a fungus that grows in dark and moist environments. It spreads easily and in some cases, it can be lethal. Tears are often shed in the darkest moments of our lives, perfect conditions for the creation of mold. “Moldy Tears,” a self-published poetry book written by Fiona Pestana, a senior majoring in journalism, carries this metaphor into the great depths of emotion. 
In “Moldy Tears,” released Dec. 18, the 22-year-old presents an intimate look into their struggle with depression and the way it has affected their relationship with themselves and others. Pestana, who grew up in San Jose, Calif., assembled 22 poignant poems into a cohesive work that is both captivating to read and view.
The words on the page are adorned by images of places such as a rocky beach and a lonely lamp post isolated in a sea of fluffy grass. The illustrations of mushrooms by Maddie Kutler, who graduated from USC in 2020, add another layer of depth and visual appeal to the book. 
“It was basically all up to her creative discretion,” Pestana said about Kutler’s decision to draw mushrooms. “They all relate to the poems they’re next to somehow.” 
The mushrooms perpetuate the idea of “moldy tears” and how emotions can spread like mold within the mind, sometimes for a very long time. But Pestana found that it is also within the mind where we can learn to understand our behaviors. 
“Going back and looking at past things kind of gives context as to why I experienced these difficulties,” Pestana said. “When something is happening and I’m clouded by depressive thoughts or intrusive thoughts, the present moment isn’t very clear and it isn’t until I look back that things kind of make sense.” 
In a sense, writing “Moldy Tears” was therapeutic for Pestana. 
“More than anything, poetry helps me wrap my head around whatever it is that I’m going through,” Pestana said. 
The journey which Pestana goes through in this book follows a clear story arc that begins with somber words and ends with gratitude. Take, for example, the first poem titled “my dearest mother.” 
“My dearest mother, I bring you the news that my dying politeness is drowning in booze,” Pestana said in the opening poem. “With the blues of a jazz bar backing its death now mother, oh mother, I’ve got nothing left.”
Emptiness — that is what the first poem seems to imply about Pestana’s mental state at the time. It is a poem that is representative of the internal and constant struggle with depression. But, Pestana shows that it is possible to reach the light at the end of the tunnel. 
In the book’s final poem, Pestana’s perspective is radically different than in poems such as “karan,” and “what stays, what’s sacred?” which appear halfway through. In “something please prick my finger (life update),” Pestana has reached the end of the introspective journey. 
“I’m in love with life and it punches me in the gut,” the poem reads. “But sometimes you find a family, an umbrella in this storm.” 
“Moldy Tears” is very much about Pestana’s journey with mental health, but it centers around experiences with other people. This coexistence with others and the importance of relationships within our lives is reflected in the way Pestana created “Moldy Tears.” Although the poems were exclusively written by Pestana, they couldn’t complete the book without a little help from their friends. 
Pestana trusted Kutler to create the illustrations for the book, and others like Alia Atkins, a senior studying creative writing and political science, helped in different ways. Atkins was among those that Pestana sought advice from on their poetry. 
“I didn’t have any real feedback, I think a lot of people just commented on the order of some of the poems,” Atkins said. “Seeing them rearrange the poems in a way that some of the heaviest stuff kind of being more at the end so that there’s a bit of an arc to it.” 
For example, Atkins said that she and others advised Pestana on the order of the poetry so that the book followed a story arc. They essentially helped Pestana find the beginning and end of “Moldy Tears.” 
But, the journey of “Moldy Tears” does not end within the borders of its pages. Pestana decided to release the book under a “name your price” model, which essentially allows you to choose the price to pay for the book. There is no catch, but there is a very important underlying reason for their decision to release the book in this manner. 
“Everyone deserves the opportunity to end up at that place of okay-ness,” Pestana said on the Instagram post where they announced the release of the book. “I am dedicating this collection to the National Queer and Trans Therapists of Color Network, which provides mental health-oriented help for queer and trans people of color.” 
Pestana understands that therapy isn’t accessible for everyone, especially people of color, which is why they decided to donate 50% of the proceeds to NQTTCN. So far, Pestana has donated $312 to the organization. 
Kutler also spoke about the importance of this cause. 
“It’s an amazing thing to write about mental health and then to also give money to places that are helping people with a mental illness,” Kutler said. 
“Moldy Tears” is a poetry book about Pestana’s journey through depression, but it is also about love and friendship. 
After speaking to Kutler and Atkins, it was clear that “Moldy Tears” was made with those two themes in mind. It was a collaborative effort helmed by Pestana’s experiences and their will.

In the age of separation and global devastation, it’s been extremely difficult for many of us to entirely pinpoint and grapple with the emotional trauma inflicted from this time. 
In her newest single, “Immune,” USC alumnus Jensen McRae proves that she’s no stranger to this struggle. Once a hypothetical Phoebe Bridgers parody about “… hooking up in the car while waiting in line to get vaccinated at dodger stadium,” “Immune” by McRae took its own form instead, with the early acoustic version receiving 2.3 million views on Twitter following the named artist’s retweet. Now a heart-wrenching, yet soft folk-rock tale, McRae seamlessly weaves together a conclusion to the emotional build-up over the pandemic, performing it as if she were in a cloudy, warm coffee shop, completely alone.
She sets the scene against a softly strumming guitar: “Traffic from the East side got me aggravated / Hotter than the day my brother graduated / Wait for hours in the sun / In line at Dodgers Stadium.” She declares, shortly, “I’m not scared of dogs or getting vaccinated.” 
Now adding reserved bongos to the muted track, her blunt disdain and annoyance sticks out sorely into the second verse. She sings “With the seat back, turn this place into a bed / Someone’s smoking in the Camry just ahead / Yeah, I know the irony / Would never be lost on me / You don’t have to point it out / Again.”
Immediately, it’s captivating how she juxtaposes the recognizable, calloused aggravation in her lyrics against the softened nature of the instrumentals. If anything, it demonstrates her mastery of songwriting, as she quickly captures the multi-level emotion behind the past year: the washed-out quiet of staying at home, the numbness to the once-painful events we’ve had to process and the sharp, edgy irritation that leaks out once provoked.
Just as we’re settling into the tranquility of the verse, the song suddenly crescendos. Sharp drums mirror even sharper vocals as the song rapidly transforms into a soul-stirring, anxious cry for clarity, questioning what follows the endless pain we’ve so effortfully acclimated ourselves to. Her voice soars: “What will we say to each other / When the needle goes in? / What will we be to each other / If the world doesn’t еnd?”
The second verse transports us right back into her imaginary car. Returning to the subtle, pastel-like nature of the instrumentals, she describes, “Radio is static through the Taylor song / Think a college football gamе is comin’ on.” Introducing several dramatic notes of violin, she bristles once again, “God you hate Top 40s shit / But as the sports preempted it / Your mouth in my ear / You hummed along.”
Now launching into the second chorus, the urgent trepidation of her voice becomes much more pronounced. Utilizing the rushing suspense of violins, the song begins to show a similar ambiance as early 2000s alternative-pop-rock artists like Anna Nalik or Michelle Branch. While remaining rushed and pronounced, her voice continues to convey emotional soreness, like a soldier’s final battle cry before surrendering to the enemy.
Her final verse returns to quietness, as she reels from the regrettable events that just occurred with her friend. “Think the nurse that gave our shots is judging us / Can she tell that we just fucked the friendship up?” She remarks, apprehensive yet all-knowing, “As we leave, I turn to you / Ask how it feels to be immune / And you know what I mean a bit too much.”
The song concludes with a fully-built-out chorus, absolutely devastating its listeners. She cries out and repeats the lyrics, “What will we say to each other? / What will we be to each other?” The violins swell, and she vocalizes softly until the dramatic, pulled-back instrumentals close the story.
Listening to “Immune,” it’s shocking to realize that the song wasn’t autobiographical. In fact, on many levels, it doesn’t feel like it was imagined at all. Remarkably, as McRae sings about listening to Taylor Swift on the radio and bickering with her friend, you can smell the interior of the car, hear the crackled radio as Top 40s play and feel the AC fighting against the smoldering, Los Angeles summer.
But “Immune” didn’t need to be autobiographical to make its point. It was the real emotion that brought the story to life. The car might have been imaginary, the song itself might’ve been schemed on a hypothetical Phoebe Bridgers album, but the frustration and anxiety brought forth is about as real as it gets for anyone living through these troubled times. It helps greatly that every element of the song worked excellently to concoct the perfect storm. The muted, subtle nature of the instrumentals brought out the scarred aggravation in her lyrics. The crescendoed emotion of the chorus and added violins towards the end instilled dramatic resonance. Topping that off with an agonizingly flawless vocal performance created a perfectly devastating conclusion to an even more devastating saga. All elements considered, “Immune” is nothing short of masterful, devastating storytelling. 
(And I will almost certainly be crying listening to it as I wait in line at Dodgers Stadium to get my vaccine.)
