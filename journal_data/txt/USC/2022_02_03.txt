With the conclusion of National Signing Day Wednesday, USC’s roster is starting to take shape. In a press conference with other USC Athletics assistant coaches Thursday, defensive coordinator Alex Grinch discussed his plans for the Trojans squad.
Players on the offensive side of the ball have received plenty of buzz, including marquee transfer quarterback Caleb Williams, running backs Raleek Brown and Travis Dye, and wide receivers Mario Williams and Brenden Rice. 
Even though the offense received high profile transfers, the defense is still looking for improvement. The Trojans have acquired some top recruits, such as 5-star cornerback Domani Jackson — the No. 1 overall recruit out of California -— and safety Zion Branch, the No. 1 overall recruit from Nevada, according to 247Sports. 
The team also picked up key transfers, such as linebacker Shane Lee, defensive end Romello Height and cornerbacks Latrell McCutchin and Mekhi Blackmon. Add on the development of young players already on the team, such as safety Calen Bullock and defensive linemen Korey Foreman, and the Trojans have potential to show up with a formidable defense September. 
Grinch has been all around the college football world, serving in coaching roles for Power Five programs such as Ohio State, Missouri and Washington State before arriving in Oklahoma, and is considered one of the top defensive coaches in the NCAA. 
Grinch, who also serves as the safeties coach for USC, has high hopes for his defense’s performance on the field. To reach these goals, Grinch and his staff look to prioritize player development this offseason. 
“What we need to do is make sure that we are enhancing the roster, number one,” Grinch said. “OK, so where are we deficient? Sometimes it is easy to identify those things, but most importantly is we got to enhance those individuals within our program right now.” 
Even as the Trojans recruited great talent across the nation, Grinch also recognizes the crucial aspect of building on these players’ existing skills. 
Grinch also addressed previous weaknesses in USC’s defense, such as tackling, and his plans to improve the team. 
“From a tackling standpoint, one of the things we try to harp on with our guys is there is no such thing as a solo tackle,” Grinch said. “[You have] to put yourself in a position to be playable on ball carriers as best you can before the play develops.” 
His philosophy on tackling involves a team-oriented, mentality rather than relying on one player. 
In a broader defensive sense, Grinch’s intentions are clear with this squad.
“How do you develop the student-athletes?” Grinch said. “How do you develop them to be bigger, faster, stronger — more explosive?”
Grinch intends to answer these questions and retool his Trojan defense before the season’s start in September.
USC will open the season against Rice at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Sept. 3.

From British Columbia to Texas and California, Indigenous scholars from four universities — USC professor Chris Finley, UC Santa Cruz community archivist Rebecca Hernadez, University of Texas professor Loriene Roy and University of British Columbia professor Shawn Wilson — came together for an event called “Decolonizing Research.” Hosted by USC Visions and Voices Wednesday night, the converstaion included discussions of the complicated relationship between Indigenous scholars and academic and cultural institutions that have systematically “erased, co-opted and excluded them.”
 Finley, an assistant professor of American studies and ethnicity, began the talk by defining the decolonization of research, which includes putting research into Indigenous frameworks, knowledge, cultures and common sense. 
One key component of decolonizing research, Finley said, is understanding that — unlike Western culture where “everything is up for grabs” — a lot of Indigenous cultures may have only some community members know information about certain traditions, either by working extensively with older adults or through ceremonies. 
“Usually, it’s only people with doctorate degrees that get to be experts, but we have a lot of elders in our communities that are experts and there’s a lot of different people that have different experiences,” said Finley, who is part of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. “Trying to survive genocide is an experience that you don’t go to school for, you experience and survive through.”
As a student enrolled in Finley’s Native studies course, Mallory Novicoff said she was required to attend the event but wanted to join anyway because of her interest in French colonization in the Great Lakes region and North America. Novicoff said she enjoys learning about the diversity of Native communities as she believes American education homogenizes Native people.
“There’s hundreds of different communities, different groups with different names, different languages, different sets of cultural practices,” said Novicoff, a senior majoring in history and French. “[The panelists] in the seminar did a great job of resisting that monolithic narrative that is often shared in the colonial academic space.”  
Wilson, a member of the Opaskwayak Cree Nation, said he hopes attendees learn that the discussion is not solely about gathering knowledge but also about relationships. 
“Everything that is in the whole cosmos is built from relationships,” Wilson said. “Relationships are the key to understanding everything there is to know about the universe — so we are not just in relationships with other people, we are in relationships with animals and plants  … but also things like ideas, abstraction.”
Wilson said it is simple to see the physical impact of colonization through genocide and violence. However, some long-term impacts of the attempted genocide on Indigenous peoples is of colonial powers success in “attacking [indigenous] ways of thinking.”
“So not just our physical bodies, but how we go about doing things like research … child rearing, our whole knowledge systems basically,” Wilson said. “It’s important to think about how we can change your ways of thinking to revitalize traditional ways of thinking about the world.” 
Finley said she hopes attendees will realize that “research and education can be different if we want it to be.” Ultimately, she said, it becomes dependent on power. 
“Decolonize research doesn’t mean a more limited research, it actually can mean a more expansive research experience and really question what learning and knowledge actually is about,” Finley said. “Instead of trying to take power, we can try to make power.”

After a nearly two-year hiatus, the Trojan Farmers Market returned to campus last Wednesday. 
Tents lined the crossing paths of McCarthy Quad, as large crowds of students, staff and faculty gathered to shop for groceries, fresh produce, pastries, jewelry and full meals. Vendors expressed eagerness to return to the farmers market for the first time since its shut down in March 2020. 
Joel Aranda, from Riverside, Calif., laid out a colorful display of oranges, lemons and avocados at his booth near the middle of the market. By far his biggest seller is his fresh-squeezed orange juice, which he produces and bottles on site. Aranda said he’s glad to be back at the farmers market, especially as he faced challenges without it. 
“It affected [farmers] because we had a lot of produce — a lot of oranges — and we have no other place to sell it,” Aranda said. “Most of the markets were closed … It was difficult.”
Amid the height of the coronavirus pandemic, Aranda said he could only sell produce in bulk, which was less profitable than selling at the farmers market. 
Sage Tollast, from Fullerton, Calif., works for Vegan Stops, which sells plant-based Mediterranean prepared meals. Although it was her first time at the farmers market, she commended the camaraderie among the market’s vendors. 
“It’s been really fun,” Tollast said. “The community of the market people are really nice as well. We all help each other out which is fun. Even though you’re kind of individually in a booth, it’s really like a teamwork thing with everybody.”
Tollast said students were glad to see vegan options at the farmers market, which she said were lacking before. 
“We’re having a really good following of everyone that’s coming here,” she said. “I know that they have been requesting vegan options. So, we’re definitely now providing for those people who didn’t really have too many options.”
The revitalized farmers market proved popular among students, with lines for several stands stretching halfway across McCarthy Quad. Among the students who enjoyed the market was Anna Boswell, a sophomore majoring in real estate development, who said she wishes USC had brought the market back sooner. 
“I love it; I’m surprised that they didn’t have it earlier. The situation with COVID hasn’t really changed, but they still decided to bring it back. I think it’s really great that there’s people coming from all over,” said Boswell as she pointed to a stand from San Luis Obispo. “I’m glad that the University is actually making partnerships with businesses.”
USC worked during the fall semester toward the eventual return of the farmers market and received many requests to restart the market, especially considering its importance to local communities, USC Hospitality wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
 “Farmer’s Markets are outdoors and an essential part of providing access to food for local communities,” the statement read. “Bringing back the Farmer’s Market also may benefit students and other community members who are food insecure, as several vendors are able to accept EBT.” 
Steve Zadek is from Brussels, Belgium and runs perhaps one of the most popular businesses at the farmers market, with students standing in long lines for his almond croissants, Nutella-filled donuts and other pastries. His booth is so popular that he has sold out before closing for two consecutive weeks. 
“It’s amazing because I’m allowed to provide a French taste to young people to educate their palettes,” Zadek said. “That fact that I’m bringing the French touch over here is maybe why I am sold out and why it goes so quickly.”
Zadek said the pandemic provided new challenges for sales, forcing him to sell online — marketing by email, phone and Instagram. Even as farmers markets resumed, finding business wasn’t always simple.
“Farmers markets are always difficult to find,” Zadek said. “We have a lot of competition. But I think that you just have to apply and apply until the moment you get it.” 
Despite the difficulties getting into markets, Zadek said he is glad to sell his pastries at the Trojan Farmers Market each Wednesday going forward. 
“I really love it,” Zadek said. “I love the ambience; I love the people. It’s international, it’s like me: multicultural.”

The Department of Public Safety is increasing officer visibility on campus in light of mass shooting threats at UCLA and recent bomb threats at historically Black collegess and Galen Center, DPS interim Chief David Carlisle confirmed to the Daily Trojan Wednesday.
There are no current threats to USC, and the security measures are intended to prevent crime and reassure the community, Carlisle said. 
On Monday, former UCLA department of philosophy lecturer Matthew Harris sent violent email threats to UCLA faculty and students, including a YouTube video titled “UCLA Philosophy (Mass Shooting)” and an 800-page manifesto outlining his threats. Police arrested Harris Tuesday in Boulder, Colo., according to the Daily Bruin. 
At least 17 HBCUs received bomb threats in the past few weeks, including six on Monday and 12 on Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. The FBI identified six juveniles behind the attacks Wednesday. Galen Center was evacuated Jan. 24 following a bomb threat and no explosives were found. 
DPS will redirect officers to more visible spots such as the Dr. Joseph Medicine Crow Center for International and Public Affairs and Galen Center rather than hire new staff, Carlisle said.

Betty Smith, author of “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,” writes on the aspirations of an adolescent girl born into unfortunate circumstances. (Photo courtesy of Creative Commons)
Yes! Another list of books you should read! Hopefully, you’re taking the hint by now. 
Just kidding. Maybe. Anyways.  
It’s already overwhelming enough to pick a book to read. But, I’d argue it’s even more overwhelming choosing a classic to take on. For most undergraduates, some of the only experiences with classic literature involve required readings from our high school English courses (typically in the form of battered used copies with phallic icons in the bylines). 
Thankfully, there is more to classic reading than “Hamlet” and “The Scarlet Letter.” Here is a short but sweet list of easy-to-read classics that don’t feel like a chore and will help you wade your way through this perhaps previously uncharted territory. All of these books date as far back as the early 20th century and will be a starting point to eventually work your way back toward older novels with tougher syntaxes and themes.
“Valley of the Dolls” by Jacqueline Susann
For “Gossip Girl” enjoyers and @DeuxMoi followers: Probably the most leisurely read on this list, this book, at points, almost reads like a salacious tabloid. The plot is furthered simply by adding betrayal, gossip and substance abuse. Besides the terribly outdated sexist undertones and societal expectations in this story, it’s ultimately just a fun read. The narrative chronicles the lives of three women as they attempt to climb to the top of their respective entertainment industries. Vanity is a currency, yet simultaneously, a delicacy in this drama-filled extravaganza. In short, beauty and misery intertwine to create the past century’s most popular cult classics.  
“This Side of Paradise” by F. Scott Fitzgerald
For those disappointed with this century’s Roaring 20s: If you actually (be honest here) read “The Great Gatsby” for your required reading in high school and wished there was a sequel matching its tragically opulent plotlines, your wish has been granted, or was in 1920. This novel follows a Princeton student who is under the impression — like most bright-eyed undergraduates — that he has a wildly successful life ahead of him. However, after trudging through a World War, numerous failed relationships, disillusionment with a corporate job and a complete depletion of inherited wealth, Amory, the protagonist, faces an abject reality, with the illustrious Jazz Age serving as an antipodal background. Out of all of the books on this list, this one was a major sensation amongst college students upon its publication, so naturally it is the perfect Fitzgerald follow-up to Gatsby. 
“Rebecca” 
by Daphne du Maurier
For those who stalk their current significant other’s ex online: Yes, this book — at least according to its advertising — is one of the greatest romance stories of all time. However, the romance marketed to unbeknownst readers has to be one of the least alluring aspects of the plot. The unnamed narrator’s descent into the darker and luxuriously covert Manderley estate warrants this novel to be classified as a horror story rather than a romance. This book will prove a quick read, not because of its actual length but because you physically will not be able to put it down. And even when you do, you’ll be kept up at night as you look to learn more and more about the titular Rebecca. 
“A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” by Betty Smith
For those still mortified by “A Little Life” by Hanya Yanagihara: Divided into five “books,” this novel begins in 1912 and illustrates a milder, less traumatizing version of Yanagihara’s masterpiece where, just like “A Little Life,” New Yorkers (specifically Brooklynites in Smith’s case) still had it rough, weaving in and out of poverty, alcoholism and untimely deaths. There’s a little more hope in Smith’s classic, though, as the main heroine Francie continues to serve as a beacon of determination and perseverance for readers to this day, rising beyond the destitute circumstances she was born into and becoming more resilient with every disappointment placed in front of her. 
“We Have Always Lived in the Castle” by Shirley Jackson 
For “The Haunting Of Hill House” watchers: While “Hill House” is also an essential classic read (and the Netflix adaptation was phenomenal), “We Have Always Lived in the Castle” is Jackson’s finest. With this being her final book, this story unwinds into a magnetic murder mystery, complete with the typical darker horror elements of greed, hostility and alienation. A dark delight shows that the family’s misdeeds are more haunting than any ghost and, for gothic newcomers, this is a great first step into the Mary Shelley-Edgar Allan Poe-Bram Stoker multiverse. 
Here’s to hoping that at least one of these choices begins your lifelong love affair with classics. Or, at the very least, just gets you to read a book.

USC has a reputation for attracting talented artists across mediums. Notably, student filmmakers make up a large portion of the creative population at the University. Whether a feature-length piece or a short film, a work’s creation includes many components and the process almost never starts with simply picking up a camera.
“There is no better art form than film because there’s so many different aspects of it,” said Lexi Brandt, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. “There’s sound, there’s lighting, there’s cinematography, there are so many different art forms in one.” 
With all these different pieces in the process, filmmakers need to decide where to start. Almost always, the process begins with a script. 
“I like to know what I’m making a film about, why I’m making it before I start writing the script,” said Cameron Kostopoulos, a senior majoring in film and television production. “I start very abstract, very big picture.”
Screenwriting can be a long process, with different creatives having different ideas of how to proceed. Given that all workers are students with busy schedules who are often volunteering their time, developing an idea and writing the script can be one of the most tedious parts of the process. Often, students may collaborate on a piece to combine time, effort and creativity.
“I love being a part of the world building level … I love collabing with other people, bouncing ideas off each other and just seems like a melting pot of creativity,” said Taylor Crawford, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies.
Writers, therefore, become the overall determining factor of whether a script can even move toward production, because, if a writer doesn’t like their own script, they aren’t going to pass it on to a producer. So to fill these positions, many creatives end up relying on clubs or personal connections. 
One creative team formed through personal connections is student film company 4085 Productions. Kaleb Manske, Alex Nimrod, Maximus Jenkins and Jordan Rice started this production company, and although they do write their own material, they will often outsource scripts to others in the field.
“Our next short film that we have coming out is going to be written by someone else. We particularly found someone that we wanted to write it. We had the idea, but we’re outsourcing the writing of the whole script, and that’s going to be done by someone else,” said sophomore Kaleb Manske, co-founder of 4085 productions.
While the writing or sourcing of a script is the first step in the production process, the film isn’t nearly done with what filmmakers refer to as the “preproduction” phase. 
“Preproduction is everything from starting with an idea to writing the script, to revising it, to finding the actors, finding the locations, finding the gear, rehearsals, everything until the cameras turn on,” said sophomore Maximus Jenkins, co-founder 4085 Productions.
But when it comes to gear, prices aren’t exactly student-budget friendly. Luckily, many students taking classes in SCA can borrow equipment. And, if they cannot get it from class, many students borrow it from other classmates or outside sources.
Along with figuring out equipment, students are tasked with creating sets to look just as realistic as any big budget production. “Set building” can be as complex as setting up a sound stage or shooting on location, but frequently with student budgets, it can be as simple as getting actors to embody the world of the film within the chosen filming location and moves around some chairs and tables. What traditionally means building a stage from the ground up can just be high quality set dressing for students.
With all the different steps in the filmmaking process, even for student films, there are many components to consider. Some of these aspects include the elements of lighting and sound. 
“Especially if you have an understated film … lighting and cinematography and all of that is very important to the way you tell a story,” Crawford said. “Movies are a visual practice. If it’s not fun looking, if it’s not visually pleasing, that’s really the whole point.”
Lighting and shadows can be changed using different kinds of angles and positions of light and can range from lighting already existing in a given space all the way to specific lights set up to get a certain shot. Many productions employ a Gaffer to help bounce light to get a visually pleasing picture.
Productions face complications throughout the whole process, from shooting to lighting issues, some occurring even during writing. 
“When there was a conflict, I had to learn, trust my gut,” Kostopoulos said. Like other student creatives, Kostopoulos has to work with his peers to solve an issue quickly so the production does not fall apart.  
Through the whole filmmaking process, the challenges and triumphs, artists are able to learn and grow to create future productions and change the industry — including the industry’s representation.
“I am a Black woman in film, and I would love to see more diverse stories about us,” Crawford said. “A lot of our Black film is traumatic, just because the history is, so it’s naturally going to be traumatic, which is fine and not fine at the same time. It’s okay, because it’s true, but no one wants to be beat over the head with oppression on TV when we can just go outside.”

The Roman poet Virgil wrote “The Aeneid,” a Latin poem on the Trojan Aeneas, who founded what would later become Rome. Little did the poet know that, years later, a different type of Trojan would come forward to also find something exciting and remarkable right on USC’s campus.  
The Aeneid Theatre Company, named after Virgil’s work, is one of USC’s few student-run theatre groups that chooses to strictly produce plays, many of which have historical significance. Directors come to ATC with ideas, not the other way around.
ATC’s approach to choosing plays they produce is straightforward, with a set number of three a year. Each show must fall into one of three categories: classic, contemporary or experimental. 
“The latter, which is defined loosely, is typically movement-based and is heavily designed. However, ATC is open to whatever the director’s vision may be,” said Naveen Bhatia, the company’s artistic director. 
To mitigate the gap between producing Shakespearean works or Greek tragedies that include heightened language and which may prove indigestible to an audience of primarily young USC adults, ATC spearheads the discussion on selecting content with the question: Why this play now? 
ATC President Ian Melamed, a senior majoring in theatre, credits this way of “getting us to really think about why we’re doing the shows that we’re doing” to Bhatia, a senior studying economics and mathematics. This way of thinking helps the executive board find applications of the older content to today’s world, allowing an ATC production to become more inviting to a larger audience. 
Although the company’s primary focus is producing plays, Bhatia said ATC also prioritizes fostering diversity, equity and inclusion and recognizes the importance of promoting this amongt the cast and crew alike. 
“DEI for theatre is tough because theatre has sort of always been viewed as the white person’s game, and trying to bring new people into the fold is really a lot of what we do, and that’s the outreach half,” Bhatia said. 
ATC also has systems in place to tangibly represent the DEI intentions of the theatre company beyond the stage. 
With “Take Initiative,” an approach applicable to numerous ATC events such as shows or playreads, the company aims to “host conversations that are lost in translation in the SDA community and within the [independent student productions] sometimes as well,” said Angela Braun, the production manager for ATC. 
“It’s a fluid opportunity for ATC to discuss these things that are pushed to the side,” said Braun, a senior majoring in cinema and media studies.
With officers on the executive board to helm the work around ensuring DEI, the company’s approach is also beneficial to breaking the barrier around the older literature that encompass many of ATC’s plays. 
“Theatre is really powerful when audiences, actors, designers and everyone involved really can see themselves in the process,” Melamed said. “[With classic works], there is a bit of a historical gap that maybe is a barrier to engagement. But I think what’s really important to address that is having a director with a vision, who can connect [the material] to something that is very salient with everyone involved.” 
From selecting the play to produce to hosting open casting calls, many of the individual steps in the production process can also become an opportunity to reflect DEI goals. 
“For me, the number one priority is the show we pick because that goes along with if people feel comfortable even working on the show or auditioning for the show. If we pick a show that does not cater to a diverse cast, we’re not going to have a diverse cast audition. That’s just the bottom line,” Braun said. 
ATC has also changed the guidelines of its productions to reflect the emphasis on DEI. Previously, the “classic” category for potential productions meant that the play must have been written before the 1800s. Now, ATC has redefined this to be any show before 1950 to include rewrites and other texts.
ATC’s newest venture, “Describe The Night” by Rajiv Joseph, opens at the Massman Theatre in the Drama Center on campus on Thursday, Feb. 10. This piece, a narrative filled with myth and conspiracy theories, spans 90 years of Russian and Polish history starting from 1920 and going to 2010, Melamed said.  
“It’s really more important than ever to critically examine the truths that we take for granted and the lies that we tell ourselves, and be courageous to tell ourselves that we’re not being truthful,” said Melamed in regards to the relevance of “Describe The Night” to today’s audience.

When the University comes up short, I hope to fill at least some of the gaps in terms of lessons learned. So, if you’re pondering the change or even currently living it, here are some tidbits I’ve picked up in my short, yet eventful, time as a Trojan commuter. Regardless of what you take from this piece, I implore you to advocate for dedicated spaces and resources for those living quite a ways away. 
Long term cost efficiency
While most college students have to bite the bullet with regards to books, groceries and other personal items in conjunction with housing costs, many commuters must also consider insurance, car repairs or public transport fees. Find ways to save a few bucks such as packing your own lunch or picking a favorite gas station to pop through — even if it’s a bit out of the USC scene. While this does mean that we have to go out of our way to make ends meet, the more we cut and jab from the cost of just getting ourselves onto campus, the more beneficial it is in the long run. 
Map it out
Long-distance commuters, such as myself, know that this city can be a real pain in the ass. Even if you leave early, the Los Angeles roads and rails have a particular affinity to fuck you over. Among them are bus lines running down random streets, trains not stopping at their designated stops and traffic jamming as soon as you reach the on-ramp. However, everyone has their own secrets about making it to class on time. Whether it’s taking a sidestreet instead of the highway or sitting on a lucky seat to make the bus run faster, find your groove. Apps such as Waze, Google Maps, Apple Maps and Transit are super helpful in making your way across the city.
Like a freshman to their first class, leave early
However, stuff happens. Your car doesn’t start up; the windows need to defrost; traffic suddenly becomes heavier than usual; trains or buses get delayed. Whatever the case, I always book it out the front door after petting my dog and chugging down a glass of water. So, the best way to better your chances of getting to your 8 a.m. on time is simply, and unfortunately, to leave early in the morning. Everyone’s done it at one point or another, y’know? 
Wrangle your schedule 
But say you don’t dig my last two suggestions.  I’d imagine that, maybe, you were new to this whole commuting thing for one. But, as a student, I have always been a proponent of stacking classes on certain days to avoid making a daily commute. Unfortunately, that plan has been foiled by the daily nature of the Daily Trojan’s paper production, so I have to make it here everyday one way or another. But, stacking classes on certain days and leaving work for those off days presents a nice balance commute-wise, knowing that you don’t have to make your way from home to work to school to work to home. Simplifying that commute is an essential key to a less stressful lifestyle.
Appreciate the smaller things in life
It is without question that commuting means a great deal of sacrifice. The commute can quickly get to your head. The daylong affairs that you might’ve shared with your friends when you lived close to them have disappeared. The FOMO that comes along with being an hour away from your friends settles in. So, maximize the time you spend on campus with the people you enjoy, but also find simple things that help the time pass — a hobby such as reading or binging shows, for instance. 
Turn it up 
While I often enjoy the natural ambience of making my way to and from Downtown, a good playlist helps to keep me sharp on the road. Similarly, Ryan’s Roses in the morning and the late ’80s mix on 94.7 the WAVE keep me in good company when I seem to have the road to myself. Personally, my K-pop playlist named “i can’t date a kpop idol, i’m a DT editor” is always a treat during the post production drive home.
Enjoy, but be conscious
Public transportation can be described like an improv, as characters pop stage left and right with unnecessary props and unknown dialogue. Listen to music, sure, but don’t be distracted by the sounds and instead focus on your surroundings. Driving, similarly, requires a great deal of focus and attention on the road. Don’t text and drive, period. For the drivers, remember, your car is your sanctuary, so take care of your ride. Because at least your car won’t break up with you over Zoom — twice. 
Commute safely, besties.

The United States Constitution is a long-winded, verbose document that gives anyone working in law a headache. So you probably didn’t know it got 58 words longer last Thursday. I most certainly didn’t. Those 58 words are “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” The Equal Rights Amendment has finally gone into force. 
The ERA was first proposed in 1923 by the National Women’s political party but was not passed by the U.S. Senate until 1972. It then took another 48 years to be ratified after Virginia signed on and the amendment finally met the requirements of Article V of the Constitution. Two-thirds of both houses of Congress and three-quarters of the states have approved and after an additional two-year post-ratification waiting period, women at long last have their rights constitutionally protected. Right?
Nope.
One extra tidbit stands in the way of the ERA becoming the law of the land: an expiration date. When Congress passed the ERA, it also got to determine how long the states had to ratify the amendment. They thought a decade would be enough time for 38 states to sign the goddamn document. Sadly, only 35 managed to do so before 1982. Nevada, Illinois and Virginia, what the fuck took you so long?
So where does that leave us? Limbo.
As New York Times writer Jesse Wegman explains, “New printings of the Constitution will not include a 28th Amendment. The Supreme Court will not treat it as part of the nation’s fundamental law. There will be no command from on high that women and men must be treated the same.”
Despite the Constitution not having a single provision regarding a timeline requirement, the national archivist and judges refuse to accept the amendment as law. 
The Washington Post writer Amber Phillips discusses the ways supporters of the ERA can get over this hurdle: Bring the issue to the Supreme Court; Congress could pass a resolution or start all over. But this hurdle should not exist in the first place.
“It’s insane that two decades into the 21st century, the U.S. Constitution still does not formally recognize the full equality of more than half the country’s population,” Wegman said. 
It’s beyond insane, it’s unfounded, groundless, unjustifiable and it makes me want to rip my hair out. 
When people think about equal rights on the basis of sex and the constitution, many think of the 19th Amendment which gave women the right to vote. It was one of the greatest milestones in gender equality, but, as Bustle writer Lea Rose Emery puts it, “Voting isn’t everything.”
There shouldn’t be an argument as to whether or not women and men should have equal rights. It shouldn’t even be a question. Yet only 10 countries have full equal rights for women, and the U.S. is not one of them. Yet, people have the audacity to say that we are the “greatest nation.”
Wegman argues that the biggest issue that stands in the way is abortion, as opponents of the amendment fear that it will “result in bans on state laws that restrict or prohibit a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy.” What a terrifying thought, that the amendment would finally stop white men in power from telling a woman what to do with her body. 
President Joe Biden issued a statement on Jan. 27 stating, “It is long past time that we put all doubt to rest. I am calling on Congress to act immediately to pass a resolution recognizing ratification of the ERA.” 
There is nothing truly stopping Congress from enforcing the ERA besides their own biases and ignorance.
Legal sex discrimination has pervaded our society far too long, but the ERA has the power to stop that. As stated on the ERA official website, while gender inequalities are caused by individual behaviors and preexisting social norms, the U.S. constitution still holds much power and the amendment can change how women are treated under the law. With the ERA, there will be “zero tolerance for any form of sex discrimination.” Is that so much to ask for?

“This game I can’t single anyone out: It was an entire team effort that was dominant. It’s hard for me to remember a performance away from home this dominant that wasn’t getting a result,” Gregg Berhalter said, addressing the press after his team’s embarrassing loss to a rival in a critical World Cup Qualifying game. 
If you couldn’t already tell, those were the words that the United States Men’s National Team manager uttered after a 2-0 loss to Canada Sunday — much to the bewilderment of USMNT team fans everywhere, including myself. 
I think I speak for all of the fans when I recount my initial reaction to what Berhalter said: “Excuse me?”
While he had the best view of the pitch, he couldn’t have watched the same game as the rest of us. Here’s what the fans and the rest of the world saw: One early defensive mistake gave way for striker Cyle Larin to slot Canada ahead in the 7th minute. From there, the U.S. showed an ineptitude that has become all too common on the biggest of stages, mustering few real chances at goal and never really putting together a cohesive product. Dysfunctional would be the one-word summary. And, of course, Canada tacked on a 95th-minute goal to add insult to injury. It was, by a country mile, the most frustrated I’ve been in this World Cup Qualifying cycle. 
It’s important to analyze both the micro and macro of Berhalter’s performance here. Some of the issues were as simple as team selection, while others run much, much deeper. 
Let me say that being a manager is by no means an easy task, especially with armchair critics such as myself, Twitter fiends (also me), TV personalities and basically everyone and their dog furiously ranting about every mistake Berhalter makes. But sometimes, the wrongdoings are just so impossibly stupid. 
Two words: Gyasi Zardes. I try to shy away from directed attacks at specific players, but I have to make an exception for this one. Without delving too far into a tirade on my least favorite USMNT player, Zardes is better suited to play at a Gold Cup level of competition, running with the B/C teams, than on the biggest stage in World Cup Qualifying. 
Seeing Zardes in the starting lineup for the Canada game made me want to gouge my eyes out. I, like many other fans, was dumbfounded that Berhalter would pick him over breakout star striker Ricardo Pepi, who already has 6 goal contributions in the campaign thus far and has proven he’s the best option up front for the U.S. 
But surely just one poor choice in the starting lineup can’t impact the team too much, right? Sadly, it absolutely can. The rest of the XI was optimal to say the least, and yet, the team wasn’t able to string together attacking play — much of the dysfunction followed Zardes’ lack of ability to distribute the ball and move it forward without being dispossessed. I know it’s a slippery slope to say it was all Berhalter’s fault, but his choice up front sabotaged any semblance of an attack for his team.
Berhalter’s second mistake came during the game, as he held out from bringing on substitutes in a game which clearly needed them until the 69th minute. Pepi came onto the pitch, and his contributions in the last 20 minutes of the game were by far the most productive from a striker on the day. But it was too little, too late. 
While there’s so much more that could be said about the game, I’ll end the microanalysis in the interest of brevity (head over to USMNT Twitter for endless examination at your own risk). 
It’s not just that what Berhalter said is blatantly wrong, comically overselling the product that his team put out on the field. It’s moreso that his comments reflect a damning reality for the United States Soccer Federation: The manager who is tasked with taking the nation to the World Cup does not have high enough standards. 
We’ve gone too far with Berhalter to turn back now. Firing him now wouldn’t make sense anyway — the U.S. still sits in second place in the Octagon with a very viable path toward automatic World Cup Qualification. Berhalter’s relative success so far is what makes this situation so difficult to approach. 
But, if you listen to some of the prominent voices of the media at the moment, many of whom are former USMNT players, the consensus is this: Berhalter’s teams are not built for the brightest lights. Something’s not right, whether it’s a matter of his tactics, his team selection, his player development or something else. Berhalter’s standards for his team are drastically lower than everyone else’s, and that’s a huge problem.
Needless to say, the final window of qualifying games is do or die. In future editions of this column, I’ll get into the math behind all the ways the U.S. could qualify and what kind of results the team will need against its last three opponents.
For now, I’ll leave you with this: Even Stephen A. Smith, a man who acknowledges himself that he doesn’t know all that much about soccer, is calling into question why Berhalter still manages the team. 
“I’m looking at [Berhalter] with a raised eyebrow, and I barely know soccer,” he said. “I’m looking at him and I’m saying to myself, ‘Why is he the coach of this team?’”
I don’t know, Stephen A., I don’t know.

Men’s swim competes against Northern California this weekend with back-to-back home meets against UC Berkeley and Stanford. The Trojans are coming off four consecutive overall wins against Arizona, Arizona State, UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara, two of which were away meets. 
Last weekend in Santa Barbara, Calif. USC won in most events, including holding the top spot in events such as the 200 Yard Individual Medley event. Freshman Chris O’Grady took first place (1:48.05), with junior Henry Blaul taking second (1:48.08) and sophomore Holden Raffin holding third (1:48.18). 
Junior Ivan Puskovitch led the Trojans in distance events by placing first in the 500-yard Freestyle and 1650-yard freestyle, as well as taking third in the 400 Yard IM. 
Puskovitch’s specialty is distance, but with some health struggles this past year, it has taken extra work to get back into racing shape.
 “Coming out with a couple wins felt amazing,” Puskovitch said. “It totally built my confidence going into this weekend. I know it’s going to be a lot harder this weekend because Cal and Stanford are serious competitors, but it [made] me so excited to get back in the water Monday morning.”  
On Wednesday, Puskovitch was announced as the Pac-12 Men’s Swimmer of the Week. 
One newcomer poised to make an impact this season is freshman Artem Selin, the current Junior European record holder and a new Freestyler from Germany. Selin’s 50-yard Freestyle currently stands at a 19.38, while his 100-yard Freestyle is a 44.25. Assistant coach Chase Bloch, a USC swimmer turned coach who has been on deck for the last eight seasons, described Selin as “someone that is extremely talented,” noting that they want to develop him in the 100-yard Freestyle moving forward.
This season has presented a unique opportunity for both freshmen and sophomore swimmers. The 2020-2021 swim season was tumultuous for athletes everywhere, as many USC sophomore swimmers have never competed collegiately before. Among them is sophomore Ben Dillard, who recently broke the  school record for the 200-yard Breaststroke. 
“I think a lot of people in the country didn’t realize how talented [Dillard] is, and he’s really kind of proving that right now,” Bloch said. 
Challenges with coaching turnover and the coronavirus have hampered the team’s success in previous seasons. This season Bloch hopes the team will rise up in the Pac-12 standings and beat some tougher competition.
 “We’re trying to set ourselves up where we have one eye at the end of the season, [but] right now, we’re obviously just trying to get there,” Bloch said. 
The competition Saturday is also special because the men’s team will be honoring its seniors on the Uytengsu deck one last time. 
The Golden Bears have consistently placed high at the national level for the last decade or so. Stanford presents another challenge, not only with its past success in the pool, but also with the Berkeley meet taking place the immediate day before. Both UC Berkeley and Stanford remain undefeated this season, each with three conference wins and four overall wins. 
“We’re going to race [UC Berkeley] as best as we can while also saving [some] of our top guys for the meet against Stanford,” Bloch said. “I think we match up a little bit better against Stanford, and I think it’s a winnable meet for us. It’s definitely going to come down to a couple of key events.”
Men’s swim and dive competes at Uytengsu Aquatics Center Friday, Feb. 4 at 2 p.m. against the Golden Bears, and again on Saturday, Feb. 5 at noon against the Cardinal.

The No. 19 USC men’s basketball team will take on the Arizona State Sun Devils in Tempe on Thursday. The Trojans defeated Arizona State in their previous meeting, beating them 78-56 in Los Angeles. 
In its last outing against Arizona State, USC overcame a slow start and a 12-point deficit on its way to what became a blowout victory. Senior guard Drew Peterson led the Trojans with 16 points while ASU graduate student guard Marreon Jackson scored a season-high 21 points. 
Jackson scored 15 of his points shooting 41% from behind the 3-point line. Overall, however, Jackson is shooting under 23% on 3-point shots this season. 
Sophomore guards DJ Horne and Jay Heath are the Sun Devils’ best shooters, each with a field goal percentage of 40%. USC’s last opponent, UC Berkeley, posted a 50% 3-point percentage, and the Trojans will look to more effectively defend the 3-point line. 
Conversely, USC struggled to shoot from deep in its game against Cal, only sinking 4 of its 17 3-point shots. 
“Each game is different,” Head Coach Andy Enfield said. “Sometimes, guys don’t make all of their shots, and we have to make sure we take good shots, but we are very good in the paint. I think each team is a little different with matchups and how we attack.”
Peterson spoke about the team’s offensive mentality going into the game against Arizona State. 
“We know they’re really aggressive on defense, so we’re trying to counter that with high ball screens,” Peterson said. 
Peterson is coming off of a 7-point and 3-assist game versus Cal. It was Isaiah Mobley and Boogie Ellis who stole the show against the Golden Bears, each with over 20 points. 
“That’s why we’re so dangerous,” said Peterson of Ellis. “We got so many guys who can step up.” 
Ellis went down after an awkward landing during a dunk attempt in last week’s Stanford game. After limping off the court with assistance, he returned to the game. The guard dispelled any worries about a potential injury with his dominant performance against Cal. 
“It was a good bounce back game,” Ellis said. “We really needed it … it’s always hard to win the next game after a tough loss.” 
Arizona State has proven capable of beating strong teams, as seen in its 69-67 overtime victory at Oregon. The Sun Devils’ defense held Oregon to 18% 3-point shooting and forced 13 turnovers. However, Arizona State is 3-6 since its victory in Eugene. 
USC is currently third in the Pac-12, behind UCLA and Arizona. With eight games remaining in the regular season, USC still has time to climb back to the top of the Pac-12 standings. With a win in Tempe, the Trojans can get back on course after splitting games against Cal and Stanford. 
The Trojans will complete their road trip when they face off against No. 7 Arizona; however, Enfield is focused on the Sun Devils. 
“We usually just prepare for the first game on our schedule, so we won’t prepare for Arizona until Friday,” Enfield said. “It’s going to be a quick turnaround but we’re prepared for Arizona State right now, and we’ll worry about the Wildcats after that game.”
