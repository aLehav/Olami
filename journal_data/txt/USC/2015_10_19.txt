The Graduate Student Government introduced a resolution at its meeting Monday night, calling on the University to adopt policies that would “effectively measure and improve the diversity, equity and inclusion climate on USC’s campus relevant to ethnicity, gender and sexuality.”
Typically, GSG votes on resolutions one month after they are introduced, but the senate voted unanimously with one abstention to hold an expedited online vote on the resolution next week.
“Students have been organizing and have been active on these issues for years, and yet our administration has failed to provide a comprehensive and strategic plan,” GSG Vice President Christina Gutierrez said at the meeting. “Administrators have instead promoted a reactive tool aimed at reporting incidents of bias rather than working to prevent them.”
Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath, one of the principal authors of the collaborative resolution between USG and GSG, echoed this frustration.
“Students have been doing this work for years and years now and we’ve gotten no real response from the administration, no real plan of action to tackle these issues other than the bias discrimination report system and the Together USC campaign [to be] launched by Student Affairs,” Sampath said. “I think we need to take a look at the systems we have in place and the policies we have in place that foster this kind of intolerant environment.” 
In her remarks, Gutierrez cited an incident on Sept. 19 involving Sampath in which a fraternity member yelled “You Indian piece of s*it!” and threw a drink at her, calling it  “xenophobic hate speech on campus.”
“Unfortunately, what happened to Rini isn’t an isolated incident — it is evidence of a larger problem at USC,” she said at the meeting.
Gutierrez further noted the ongoing Title IX investigation at USC, student reports of bias on the “I, Too, Am USC” Facebook page, the recent campus climate survey in which nearly 30 percent of female undergraduates who responded said they had experienced sexual assault and a forum held by USG on Sept. 30 that discussed the issue of diversity as examples of the larger problems with the campus climate. 
“With the incident that happened to Rini, and her publishing it and it getting national media attention, I think USG and GSG and leaders from student organizations recognized that we have a unique opportunity with this national media attention to continue to further urge our administration to act and this is the first time that USG and GSG have collaborated on this kind of campaign and initiative,” Gutierrez said in an interview with the Daily Trojan.
Gutierrez said that the current mechanisms in place, namely an online form for reporting incidents of bias, are insufficient and that the administration has not followed through with its promises to increase student awareness, distribute educational resources and collaborate with students and cultural assemblies. 
“What the administration has presented to our student body have been reactive measures to report incidents after they happen but nothing really focused on how we address the culture that allows these incidents to persist,” Gutierrez said. “We’re looking at how we address that culture and [how to implement] preventative measures.”
The resolution calls on the administration to hire a vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion to develop a strategic plan to improve campus climate. The vice president would then work with the academic deans of each academic division or school within the University to hire a vice dean for diversity, equity and inclusion. The resolution asks for undergraduate and graduate students to be involved in all of the hiring processes. 
“We’re really calling on our administration to put together a comprehensive and strategic plan to address these issues rather than pointing us to a kind of piece-meal, after-the-fact kind of resource,” Gutierrez said.
The resolution further asks the administration to increase access to demographic metrics for students, faculty and staff, and increase transparency and accountability for reports of bias incidents and Title IX complaints. 
In addition, the resolution requests the University develop a plan for addressing diversity, equity and inclusion within a year as well as to significantly increase the number of underrepresented students, faculty, staff and trustees to reflect national demographic levels by 2025. The resolution calls for the creation of a $100 million fund to support underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students and tenured faculty positions for underrepresented minorities. 
Finally, the resolution calls for the University to redefine and recommit itself to diversity, invest additional resources in cultural centers, and create a space for dialogue about campus issues. It also seeks mandatory diversity and cultural competency training for graduate students, student leaders and faculty. 
Sampath feels the list of demands is necessary to elicit action from the University. 
“We have tried asking for some things, and those requests haven’t been met in the past so the mentality we have right now is dream big,” Sampath said. “We know that we can’t resolve issues of discrimination overnight, but we need to set the standard.”
Sampath pointed out that UCLA, a public university, has a vice chancellor for equity and diversity.
“It’s something so reasonable to ask that our university invest its resources and reprioritize its resources when it comes to issues of how students are feeling on this campus as a whole,” she said.
Gutierrez said resources are already in place, citing the example of the Center for Urban Education within the Rossier School of Education, which has developed an equity scorecard tool for equity analysis and has implemented this tool at universities around the country, but not at USC.
“We have the resources, we have the support in place, it’s just a matter of the administration really valuing and taking this seriously and utilizing those resources to address the problem.”
The resolution is supported by several organizations including the Black Graduate Student Network, Awujo House, the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, the Asian Pacific Graduate Student Association and the Black Alumni Association. 
The resolution will be presented at the weekly USG Senate meeting Tuesday night.
“[The resolution] is what students have been asking for years now, but it’s something that we’re now as a student collective writing down and putting it on one document where we can say, “This is what we need to see in terms of change happening at our University,” Sampath said.

Glenn Fox, a postdoctoral researcher at USC’s Brain and Creativity Institute, led a study to investigate gratitude in the face of dire circumstances.
In order to do so, Fox’s team conducted a brain-scan of 23 study subjects who had no personal relationship with the Holocaust while exposing them to survivor’s stories, according to USC News. These testimonials, provided by the USC Shoah Foundation, showcased instances of generosity and gratitude among survivors.
In order to immerse the study subjects in the Holocaust, the research team showed them brief documentaries that explored the rise of Nazism, persecution, internment camps, the Final Solution and the Allied Liberation.
Then the researchers presented subjects more than 50 second-person scenarios based on survivors’ stories. Researchers finally asked the subjects to rate the “depth of their gratitude” in these situations.
According to USC News, researchers found that feelings of gratitude activated brain areas responsible for moral cognition, fairness, economic decision-making and subjective value judgments. In addition, the subjects commented on how the study had led them to a deeper comprehension of the Holocaust.
Participants said they walked away with a better understanding of the Holocaust.
Shoah Foundation Executive Director Stephen Smith also expressed the importance of preserving “the voices of people who lived through these dark times,” as they show, among other things, the power of generosity to help individuals “hold on to their humanity.”
The study was published in the academic journal Frontiers in Psychology on Sept. 30. The study’s co-authors were Jonas Kaplan, an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology, and Hannah Damasio, a professor of neurology and psychology and the co-director of BCI.
The study was funded by the Oskar Schindler Humanities Foundations, the Shoah Foundation and a dissertation research award from the Greater Good Science Center’s Expanding the Science and Practice of Gratitude Initiative.

Members of the Political Student Assembly met Monday night to discuss the significance of “anti-establishment” candidates and agreed that the prominence of unconventional candidates appears to be a strong theme in the upcoming election.
Republican, Democratic and unaffiliated students alike voiced their opinions in the discussion forum, which centered around understanding what constitutes an anti-establishment candidate and why this election cycle features these candidates so prominently.
In an election year where three of the top Republican presidential candidates — Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina — have never held political office, and the second-highest polling Democratic contender — Sanders — is a self-proclaimed socialist, students acknowledged that the upcoming primary seems to have a theme of unconventional candidates.
However, students disagreed over exactly how to define an anti-establishment candidate, as well as what constitutes the establishment in the first place.
“I would characterize [the establishment] as orthodox thought,” said Jonathan Gunn, a junior majoring in economics. “An anti-establishment candidate is someone who differs. Both Trump and Sanders are very idiosyncratic, and they both have Democratic and Republican views. I think it’s interesting to see these candidates mixing ideas, and that’s what makes them anti-establishment.”
Others, such as USC College Republicans President Jacob Ellenhorn, believed that despite lacking any connection to the “establishment,” unconventional candidates such as Trump or Fiorina still display certain similarities to their more orthodox counterparts.
According to Ellenhorn, though one does not need political experience to run for president, other qualifiers still apply.
“I think you do need experience leading a large organization of some kind, whether that be a large business or a hospital, to show that you are capable of leadership of a large operation such as the U.S. government,” Ellenhorn said. “I don’t think we’re going to see a candidate who has been a stay-at-home mother or father their whole life anytime soon.”
Along with attempting to define what it means to be pro- or anti-establishment, the discussion also tackled the question of why many unconventional candidates are dominating the current political stage. Some, such as Alec White, former president of the USC College Democrats, believed that support for “anti-establishment” candidates has long been a hallmark of the Democratic Party dogma.
“The phrase ‘Democrats fall in love, Republicans fall in line’ definitely still applies,” White said.
Other students disagreed, citing both historical and contemporary political examples to argue that there is no established party preference for unconventional or conventional candidates.
Despite any implied variation along party lines, however, many students agreed that in the current election cycle, voters are increasingly supporting anti-establishment candidates because of a desire for change.
“What [voters] are interested in is seeing the way that the system is working to change,” Ellenhorn said. “They want to work within the system to reform it.”
Ultimately, PSA leaders such as Jenny Di, a junior majoring in policy, planning and development and economics, believe that these voters include college students, who benefit from the kind of open discussion that is currently taking place regarding anti-establishment candidates.
“I think [this discussion] is important because a lot of times these candidates appeal to younger generations … who have seen a lot of problems in the federal government and want to see a major overhaul,” Di said. “I think it’s important for us to get all of our opinions out there and to hear everyone else’s opinions.”

Janis Yue | Daily Trojan
“Two Seats Left.” My friend McKenna and I stared at the screen on the ticket machine, overjoyed at the message we were greeted with.
“We’re going to Paris!” we screamed. It was a Wednesday night, and we had just found ourselves a €120 round trip ticket to the home of street-side crepes, the Mona Lisa and everything in between.
We boarded the bus Thursday night, and arrived in Paris around 11 a.m. Friday morning. As soon as we got there, we hopped on the Metro to visit the Sacré–Cœur, a beautiful basilica overlooking the city that’s located in Paris’s artist district, where Picasso and Van Gogh once lived. We enjoyed beignets aux pomme (heavenly light donuts with caramelized apple dunked in sugar) and a bottle of Moscato while lying on a hill in front of the basilica.
Sure, it was a 12-hour bus ride on Thursday night and again on upon our return to Madrid, but after doing about an hour of research, we decided that this would be the most cost effective way to travel. Here are some tips to plan the perfect weekend trip while abroad:
Step One: Don’t be afraid to plan things spontaneously.
Letting go of the feeling that everything should be precisely planned out weeks in advance will really open your life to some priceless possibilities and memories. McKenna and I had found that we had a four-day weekend coming up without anything special planned since we had been bogged down by schoolwork, but after our exam and Wednesday, we decided to “carpe diem” it up.
Step Two: Look into all the possible transportation routes.
I’ve found that doing a quick Google search of “best way to go to ____ from ____” will usually yield helpful results from scores of people who have previously traveled the same route. In Europe, budget airlines are usually a great way to go, but buses and trains are also very viable options.
Step Three: Figure out where you’re staying.
We booked an AirBnB two days before our arrival and ended up staying with a friendly Argentinian fashion designer and his partner. When booking somewhere to stay, keep location, cost-efficiency and safety in mind. 
Step Four: Figure out who your ideal travel mate is.
It’s probably possible to have fun with anyone when you’re in Europe, when there’s so much incredible culture to absorb, but I’ve learned that there are certain people who will help you get the most out of your experience. Personally, I’m a huge fan of museums and art and nature sites, but I also like to explore the nightlife scene. I’ve traveled with a few people in my program who like to obsessively plan an itinerary full of historical sites beforehand, and I’ve also traveled with a few people whose main priority is to party. McKenna and I have turned out to be really compatible travel partners, as we like to have a list of cultural places we want to visit but we also like to leave a certain amount of spontaneity in our trips.
Step five: Make a list of places you want to go to.
While you may find that asking locals about their favorite sites is a great way to explore a city, it will help to go into the city having a general idea of its layout and some of the must-see locations. I personally love TripAdvisor, a forum where people describe their past experiences, and I also like to GoogleMap locations beforehand to see if the order of locations makes sense for maximum efficiency.
After enjoying our afternoon, McKenna and I headed to the famous Eiffel Tower and bought a ticket to go to the very top. It may be cliché, but the view literally took my breath away. While trying to soak in the magnificent scene of lights, I could only think about how blessed I was to be living this life and experiencing such pure wonder, and I how was lucky enough to still have another midnight left in Paris.
Following these five basic steps allowed me to  have the most enriching and enthralling weekend of my life.

If you showed me the current college football rankings at the beginning of the season, I would never have believed you.
We have seen some crazy wins this year, most recently and probably the craziest win we’ll see all season in last week’s Michigan State win over Michigan on a fumbled punt return as time expired. An unranked Texas upset No. 10 Oklahoma in the annual Red River Rivalry, and unranked Memphis upset No. 13 Ole Miss.
But of all the conferences in college football, the Pac-12 has been most unpredictable this season. It is because of that unpredictability that the conference is still technically up for grabs. USC and Oregon were the preseason favorites to win, while Stanford and UCLA were expected to be contenders. Fast forward seven weeks and only one of those teams is ranked and Utah and is leading the conference.
The preseason media poll had Oregon winning the North division and USC winning the South, and the Trojans going on to win the Pac-12 Championship game. Stanford and Cal were second and third, respectively, in the North division. Arizona State and UCLA were second and third in the South, respectively, while Utah was picked to finish fifth in the South.
Oregon was ranked seventh overall in the preseason poll while USC was No. 8, UCLA was No. 13, Arizona State No. 15 and Stanford and Arizona were     No. 21 and 22, respectively. Now, Utah has gone from unranked to No. 3, Stanford has risen to No. 10 overall and Cal has also cracked the top 25 at No. 20.
Oregon falling out of the top 25 is surprising given their success in recent years, but it is not hard to understand, as losing last year’s Heisman trophy winner to the NFL has obviously created a void that the Ducks have not yet learned how to fill.
No. 20 Cal is not as much of a surprise, as they received some preseason hype thanks to quarterback Jared Goff, but I don’t think anyone expected Cal and Utah to meet undefeated in Week 6. Cal ended up losing to Utah, but they are currently ranked No. 20 in the nation and have become the favorite to beat unranked UCLA this weekend.
Stanford got off to a rough start this season, losing 16-6 to Northwestern, which caused them to drop out of the top 25. However, the Cardinal upset  No. 6 USC at the Coliseum in Week 3 and went on to upset No. 18 UCLA, 56-35. Stanford has been a consistently good team and is led by  senior quarterback Kevin Hogan. Especially given the fact that Oregon is down this season, Stanford has all the necessary tools to win the Pac-12 North.
UCLA was a preseason favorite, and many experts predicted a neck-and-neck race for the Pac-12 South title against USC. Like Oregon, however, UCLA is without an experienced quarterback and leader. The Bruins are led by true freshman Josh Rosen, who has shown flashes of brilliance this season, but has followed up those performances with mistake-ridden games that highlight his youth and inexperience.
Perhaps I’m biased, but the biggest surprise to me is USC. With a redshirt senior quarterback calling plays and an immensely talented offense, I truly believed that the Trojans had everything we needed to win the Pac-12 and potentially a national title. It’s easy to blame our 3-3 record on everything that has happened this season surrounding Sarkisian’s problems, but I think that USC is simply too talented to be .500 halfway through the season.
The problem isn’t a lack of talent or even a head coach, though the latter certainly doesn’t help. The problem with USC is consistency. Last season, Kessler threw only five interceptions, the same amount he has thrown already this season. He has struggled with maintaining his composure when the game is on the line. Despite the loss to Stanford, Kessler played well and the defense stalled, while the opposite was true in the loss to Washington. Against Notre Dame, Kessler and his offense made some incredible plays, but also fell apart in the fourth quarter.
Consistency, especially at the quarterback position, seems to be the reason why some Pac-12 teams are unranked and why others are exceeding expectations. Rosen and Kessler have struggled to remain consistent while Jared Goff has maintained his composure and led his team to a 5-1 start, losing only to Utah.
If Utah begins to lose its composure and drops a few games, and USC starts to live up to its potential, the Trojans can get right back in the hunt for the Pac-12 South title.

Women’s volleyball libero Taylor Whittingham was named Pac-12 Conference Defensive Player of the Week for her play during Oct. 12-18, as announced by the conference on Monday.
Her play on defense helped the No. 1 Women of Troy notch their 20th win of the season and stay undefeated, as Whittingham and the team defeated two ranked Pac-12 opponents over the weekend in Arizona and Arizona State.
The 5-foot-8-inch junior was everywhere on the court for the No. 1-ranked Women of Troy over the weekend, posting back-to-back season highs and collecting 53 digs in eight total sets to lead USC (20-0) to wins over No. 10 Arizona State and No. 14 Arizona.
This honor marks the      second-career Pac-12 weekly honor for the Rancho Santa Margarita, California native and the second defensive accolade for USC this season. Whittingham joins seniors Samantha Bricio and Alicia Ogoms as USC’s weekly award winners this year.
An AVCA All-American honorable mention just a year ago, Whittingham currently leads the Pac-12 with 4.90 digs per set and has logged 338 digs on the season. Against the Sun Devils, Whittingham recorded a then-season high of 26 digs and seven assists from the libero spot. Two days later, she tallied a new season-high of 27 digs against the Wildcats. The two matches saw Whittingham produce her fourth and fifth matches this season over the 20-dig mark, accounting for an impressive 6.62 digs per set, while only recording one reception error all weekend. She also produced a 35 percent dig-to-kill ratio                                                (9-of-26) against the Sun Devils and was 14-of-20 (70 percent) pass-to-kill in USC’s match against Arizona. For her career, Whittingham is now just 49 digs away from reaching 1,000 digs.
Thanks to the junior’s outstanding defense, USC nabbed all 64 first place votes in this week’s AVCA Division I Coaches Poll and remains at No. 1 for the third straight week. USC is a perfect 20-0 on the season (8-0 Pac-12) and joins Kansas as the two lone undefeated teams in the nation.
The Women of Troy will now gear up for a trip to the Pacific Northwest this weekend, facing off against Oregon State on Friday at 8 p.m. and then              No. 25-ranked Oregon on Sunday at 1 p.m. Both matches will be broadcast live on the Pac-12 networks.

Director Steven Spielberg’s latest film, Bridge of Spies, tells the story of James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a Brooklyn insurance claims lawyer who is thrust into the center of the Cold War when he’s assigned to represent Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Not only does the film expose an extraordinary story during the Cold War, but it also carries over themes relevant to modern day society.
At the core of Bridge of Spies is the concept of spycraft. In the United States, Abel is being tried by the American government for spying on behalf of the Soviets. Meanwhile, fighter pilot Francis Gary Powers’s (Austin Stowell) U-2 spy plane is shot down over the Soviet Union. Powers is then captured and interrogated as an American spy. Within the film — and within the Cold War in general — warfare revolved around spying. Spielberg pointed out that the idea of being watched constantly is still relevant today.
“Only in the last two years since we unearthed this story for the first time and started telling it, a lot has happened that has taken us back to the life and times of the Cold War,” Spielberg said during a conference call.
According to Spielberg, there are obvious comparisons to the espionage and spycraft during the Cold War to the spying that goes on in America today.
“In the ’50s we flew U2s over the Soviet Union, and today we’re flying drones everywhere,” Spielberg said. “We were spying on each other all through the ’50s and ’60s, and today, we have a great deal of cyber hacking which is a form of espionage.”
Essentially, the themes and anxieties of the Cold War — national security, privacy and espionage — are every bit as relevant today; except instead of an outsider enemy of the Soviet Union, the cause is a little closer to home. Whether it’s whistleblower Edward Snowden or the constant reminder that advertisers are watching consumers’ transactions online, one thing is clear: Civilians are being watched.
By bringing to popular culture the issues of the Cold War, this film brings up questions of how far governments should go to protect their civilians. Spielberg, along with Hanks and Ryland, manages to make the audience feel for and relate to Soviet spy Abel, even though Abel represents the opposing side. After all, Abel appears to be a good man who’s just doing his patriotic duty for his country.
Moreover, central to this film is how Donovan abandons his ordinary life to not only defend a Russian spy, but also to travel to East Berlin to negotiate with the Soviets to release Powers and another hostage American in turn for Abel. Though it remains slightly confusing as to why Donovan becomes so immersed and intrigued by the Soviet spy Abel, Donovan is still a man who sticks to his values and the American virtues of democracy and fair defense.
However, Donovan is not a soldier in any sense — he does not physically fight his way to victory. Rather, he employs the art of conversation and the art of negotiation, according to Spielberg. Like all good heroes, he refuses to give into societal pressure and fear tactics, and instead holds onto his deepest values despite a potentially dangerous outcome.
Spielberg proclaimed his admiration for Donovan’s tactics and the kind of story he represents.
“[Donovan] is a great example of what we need more of today not only in the diplomatic world, but on Capitol Hill and just the way people should be more patient with each other in trying to figure out or trying to celebrate what makes us different and not being so quick to judge someone who is not the same as us,” Spielberg said.
Though viewers may see Donovan as a hero, Spielberg said it isn’t his job to “forge heroes” as much as it is to provide accurate representations of the events of history.
“I don’t really think about Donovan or [Oskar] Schindler or [Abraham] Lincoln as my hero. I think of them as people I can learn something from. I’m really happy to hear if any of those characters become the heroes of others,” he said.
Donovan, Schindler and Lincoln are only three characters in the many true stories Spielberg has portrayed on screen. These films not only teach, but also draw parallels to similar modern issues. And, according to Spielberg, it’s essential to not only look at these instances of the past to help to look at the present, but also to look forward to the future.
“When I started having kids, it made me look ahead and then that forced me to look back ’cause I’ve always loved history,” Spielberg said. “I’ve always said to my kids you, you can’t go forward unless you know where all of us collectively have been, and so I’ve always had this interest in historical subjects.”

All gastropubs, upscale offshoots of British pub culture, have one thing in common — good alcohol and high quality food. Simmzy’s in Manhattan Beach is no different, combining laid-back ambience and reasonably priced fusion cuisine to beachgoers.
Located two blocks from the Manhattan Beach Pier, this bustling gastropub features a wide selection of craft beers and a simple, yet delicious menu.
Upon entering, customers are greeted by a neon-lit Simmzy’s sign and a chalkboard for the wait list. The space is quaint, yet looks deceptively large — the back walls are covered in mirrors, creating the illusion of a spacious restaurant. On a busy weekend night, the restaurant is packed to the brim with little space to walk or sit between the merged bar and dining area. This setup allows for intimate conversations between two to four people, among the overall buzz that fills the place. There are no reservations, so expect a wait no matter what time you arrive. However, the service is splendid and the host will check up on patrons as they wait to be seated.
The dark wooden ceiling is lit by string lights that are dimmed, creating a warm and comfortable atmosphere while complementing the simple wooden tables and chairs. Subtle beach décor accents line the walls, reminding people that they are next to the beach — something unnecessary for patrons seated on the patio, who can look to their left where the ocean will pleasantly greet them.
The menu itself can be described as SoCal-meets-Britain street food, including kale salad, fish tacos and quinoa. The food is sourced by local seasonal ingredients by growers such as Tanimura and Antle artisan lettuces, Breadbar breads, Drake Family Farms goat cheese and Manhattan Meats sausage.
Popular appetizers include fries two ways — either covered with blue cheese dressing and garlic (Blue Cheese Haystack) or a combination of shoestring and sweet potato fries with sides of garlic aioli and avocado buttermilk sauce (Mixed Bag). The Mixed Bag fries were crisped to perfection but were greasy overall and the sauces lacked flavor, though ketchup was the best.
New seafood specialties include Tuna Poke and Shrimp and Rock Cod Ceviche. The ceviche was accompanied by two fried tortillas dusted in cumin, a new twist, but one that overpowered the acidic ceviche rather than complementing it.
Simmzy’s Burger is the average pub burger with onions, cheddar, lettuce and tomato — all for about $10. The meat itself was cooked to medium-rare, as requested. It does not come with fries, hence the popularity of the fries as an appetizer.
The Grilled Fish Tacos are a high point of the menu because they are made with fresh, wild-caught Oregon rock cod, succulently grilled to perfection. They are also topped with fried chile rings, which add a much needed textural difference and heat compared to the mild tomato salsa and avocado.
Simmzy’s is popular for its brunch menu, pairing breakfast scrambles made with organic cage-free eggs, sandwiches and burritos with Sangria and mimosas. There is also a kids menu for children under 12, welcoming all ages to the pub.
Drink specials are written colorfully on a chalkboard and include creatively named beverages such as “Woodchuck Gumption Cider” and “Epic Brainless on Raspberries.”
Simmzy’s is a great place to visit before or after relaxing on the beach with friends. It also is not a haughty gastropub that serves overpriced food. Students can easily visit this pub without breaking their college budget. A dinner for two with appetizers and entrees runs about $40 without drinks.
Simmzy’s has four locations around Los Angeles: Manhattan Beach, Burbank, Venice and Long Beach. A Huntington Beach location is coming soon.
A mere 25-minute drive away from campus, Simmzy’s Manhattan Beach is located at 229 Manhattan Beach Blvd and is open 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 11 a.m. to midnight on Friday, 10 a.m. to midnight on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Sunday.
Great review! I could almost taste the food

I have always stood by the fact that I am not a feminist.
While Beyoncé and Emma Watson sing and speak about how their political beliefs influence their work and the way they encourage women, I believe that they could do all those same things without labeling it “feminism.”
Despite the fact that I’m a double minority — I am a person of color and a woman — my political beliefs and views on social justice have revolved around my racial status more so than being a woman. Maybe that’s because I’ve been African American longer than I’ve been a full-fledged woman compared to a girl. I’m not sure, but feminism just didn’t seem right for me.
Plus, I was never really sure what it was. We have the right to vote, we are way more present in the classroom than men and Hillary Clinton is a sure frontrunner in the Democratic presidential debates. Things, for the most part, seem OK.
Oh yes, and we also have Beyoncé. She’s everything and more.
Yet last week, while I was completing my new favorite pastime of filling out job applications, I was thrown right into the midst of the recurring wage inequality debate. On the application, when I reached the section that prompted me to list “expected wage,” I typed in a number, then I deleted it. I had quickly determined that the wage I was asking for was too high and would take away my chances of getting an interview. So my solution was to ask for less.
It was a split-second decision that was built on years of being told how much less women should expect from society. It was built on years of being told to be thankful for opportunities and not question the status quo. Or maybe it was from years of not receiving a constant stream of pep talks about being a go-getter, fearless and ruthless — conversations that our society tells young men each day.
The traits that have been instilled or not instilled in me led to that moment of stopping negotiations before they even started. I mean, the worst that could happen was being told “no.”
I’ve read and been told stories like mine many times before. Yet they never resonated because income inequality hadn’t directly affected me yet.
So that’s why when Jennifer Lawrence penned her 658 eloquent words on wage inequality this past week, it stuck with me. The actress, who is the face of the Hunger Games franchise, wrote that when she learned she was being paid millions less than men, she realized that it came from a perception of wanting to maintain the double standard society puts on women.
She wrote, “But if I’m honest with myself, I would be lying if I didn’t say there was an element of wanting to be liked that influenced my decision to close the deal without a real fight. I didn’t want to seem ‘difficult’ or ‘spoiled.’”
Lawrence listed her age and her personality as contributing factors to the wage gap. I’m not saying that I could be making millions more than I do already, but she definitely wrote on a relatable topic.
But thoughts like the one she expressed are being swept under the rug. Before I deleted my expected salary, I couldn’t imagine not asking for what I needed — and I’m an only child, so trust me, I know the art of asking for what I need.
When it comes to asking for what they need in a job, female millennials may not be speaking up as frequently as they could be.
Yet, women who fall under the millennial banner have a unique opportunity to start reversing this trend. The first step to tackle these systematic injustices starts with redefining what women’s equality means. It’s not just voting rights, and it’s not just about getting hired in boys’ club industries like tech and accounting.
It’s about creating a culture of feeling comfortable asking for what we need after we’ve worked our way to that interview chair.
This generation, the most diverse in the country’s history, has many faults. We all have different needs and various understandings of self. But the root of social justice issues is asking for what we need from those who are able to give it and just might not understand certain pressures and standards put on women.
For millennials who are women, we must show all our cards and fight for equal wages. I still don’t think I’m at the point of calling myself a feminist, but I’ve sure learned that feminism is definitely a valid cause. It creates an avenue to fight for issues that need to be changed.
I believe the world, one that is being shaped more and more by millennial opinion, should start helping us create these changes as well.

It appears that once again, the ignorance and unfounded prejudice that has for so long characterized conservative opposition to the socioeconomic advancement of the poor has reared its ugly head — this time, in the form of opposition to the Motor Voter Act recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown.
The law, designed to simplify the process of voter registration, gives any California citizen obtaining a driver’s license the ability to opt into the voting process — a much-needed move to expedite voter registration. Before the bill’s introduction, most affluent citizens could find the leisure time to register through more onerous processes. However, the working class — largely comprised of those who work 10-12 hour days through multiple shifts, positions and locations — found themselves unable to either find the time to register or find transportation to a site that could facilitate it. The Motor Voter Act resolves the problem created by these socioeconomic barriers, reaffirming California’s commitment to political equality and combatting a very serious and real threat to the sanctity and validity of the American democratic process.
However, since California also has been one of the only states to issue driver’s licenses to undocumented workers, conservative opposition has suggested that these laws are somehow part of a larger political conspiracy to allow undocumented workers to vote and thus bolster the Democratic party. Though obviously outlandish, this assertion also fails to recognize the realities associated with the process of voter registration through the Motor Voter Act — and the lives of undocumented workers in the state of California.
First, the secretary of state’s office must verify the eligibility of all voters. The overwhelming majority of undocumented workers do not have birth certificates, social security cards or any type of insurance or state-sponsored identification. Additionally, they do not appear in any government records and — most importantly — do not actually lead lives that would afford them the opportunity to obtain one of these documents, much less several in tandem. Therefore, the idea that the secretary of state’s office could fail to invalidate an attempt to vote by one of these persons is absolutely ridiculous.
Second, the argument that the Motor Voter Act would open the voting process to undocumented workers makes several key assumptions that are truly heinous when held to the light. First, it assumes that undocumented workers would even seek to participate in the voting process. The majority of undocumented workers in California do not own televisions. They do not sit around on laptops and mull through the news. They do not receive public education in civics and American politics. Moreover, many are largely illiterate, and others are only proficient in written Spanish — not written English. It is extremely difficult for an undocumented worker to be able to first discern how and when to vote, much less consider the pros and cons of the varying political candidates within our highly complex partisan structure without widespread educational materials and easy media access. More importantly, it is unfathomable why the conservative opposition would possibly think that an undocumented worker would enter a location rife with police and government personnel and sacrifice a workday’s pay in the process.
Third, the argument implies that the currently disenfranchised group of working class voters who will be serviced by this bill should not be enfranchised because they vote liberally; even if 100 percent of these undocumented voters voted for the Democratic party, that still does not give conservatives the right to assert that they should not be granted access to participation in their own political system.
Moreover, the argument that the definition of a citizen will somehow be impacted by the ability of undocumented workers to vote — the unlikelihood of which having been addressed above — is equally asinine. The definition of the citizen has never hinged on the ability to vote. Women were not eligible to vote until 1920, but they were citizens for the 144 years prior. Perhaps conservatives would have recommended that we deport them all. The definition of a citizen is not what bothers these opponents of the bill — rather, it is the fear that their party’s alienation of the poor and people of color will finally come to fruition in the unwillingness of newly enfranchised working class citizens to support their party. It is the fear that they will defeat the Republican policies which for so long have hindered by their ability to seek socioeconomic advancement and political equality in favor of the white elite.
The Motor Voter Act will increase voter turnout in a system attempting to expand enfranchisement to oppressed and underprivileged groups, standing as perhaps one of the only worthwhile pieces of legislation aiming to benefit California’s working class. In truth, undocumented workers have nothing to do with the opposition. Rather, these are the last cries of the elephant as its party finally lays down to die.
Lily, have you ever visited a single undocumented person’s home?  You would be surprised that they do, in fact, own TVs and they do, in fact, watch the news, albeit in a language other than English most of the time.  Your opinion piece is so full of faulty assumptions that it really takes away from your message.
I, too, believe that government should make the voting registration process easily accessible, but adding a million applications will only serve to overwhelm those who are responsible for vetting the voter registrations.  We all know how well those agencies perform their duties…
1) does the state have the resources or will to check if applicants are eligible to vote?
2)do we want voters that cannot figure out the registration process or can’t be bothered?
3) is voting worth the effort?
4) after decades of D party rule in California, why do we still have disenfranchised people?

There’s no better way to enjoy a day of California sunshine than brunch on a beach. Whether you’re in the mood for something sweet or savory, here are the best spots to enjoy a meal and study break before you head out to the water.  
Malibu is a little slice of paradise and entirely worth the trek up Highway 1. The panoramic views of the California coastline from your rearview mirrors are breathtaking and the perfect escape from the stress of midterms. If the beach isn’t reason enough to make the trip up the coast, the best brunch destination is hands down Malibu Farm Café. Located at the end of the Malibu pier, you can enjoy your food with a 360-degree of the ocean. Their menu features brunch essentials including a smoked salmon scramble, breakfast burrito and my personal favorite, the Swedish mini pancakes with sliced strawberries and whipped cream. To drink, the fresh pressed watermelon juice is a must or, if you need a little boost, the iced caramel latte. All beverages are served in mason jars – definitely Insta-worthy!

2. Santa Monica – Huckleberry
This cute café located a five-minute drive from the quintessential Santa Monica Pier is well worth the traffic of the 10 West. Whether you have a sweet tooth or a taste for savory, Huckleberry has it all. For all you health nuts out there, Huckleberry offers quinoa with vegetables and eggs sunny-side-up. If your mouth isn’t watering yet, let’s talk about their pastries. Huckleberry’s baked goods are the best in the game ranging from maple pecan donuts to strawberry cream cheese cupcakes to brioche donut holes.

3. Manhattan Beach – The Strand House
Manhattan Beach is a sweet escape just a short drive south of USC studded with cute cafes, shops and stunning scenery. My favorite brunch spot is The Strand House, which features prime ocean views and breakfast staples some of which include lemon ricotta pancakes, huevos rancheros and a salmon eggs Benedict. And did I mention they have homemade cinnamon rolls? To drink, I’d go with the fresh pressed grapefruit juice. Or, if you need a little pick-me-up, go for the “Sunrise Over Manhattan Beach,” which has prosecco, fresh tangerine juice and blood orange cordial. Oh, so refreshing!

4. Laguna Beach – Banzai Bowls
If you haven’t hopped on the acai bowl bandwagon yet, you’re missing out. This tantalizing treat is the perfect way to start your day. And you might as well enjoy it on the beach. Banzai bowls has the freshest ingredients blended to perfection with toppings to die for including coconut shavings and chia seeds. This oh-so-healthy breakfast will leave you feeling energized and refreshed for a day spent with your toes in the sand.

Country favorite Luke Bryan, pictured here playing at the Rockford Riverfront in August 2008, will be performing at Stagecoach next spring. Photo courtesy of Larry Darling, Flickr.
It’s time to dust off the old cowboy boots and break out the denim because Stagecoach Country Music festival is right around the corner. In the past, Stagecoach has featured a unique blend of artists for its country lineup, and this year may prove  to be even better. The festival which, will be held April 29 through May 1 in Indio, California has just released its stellar lineup for this year. 
Stagecoach is featuring a wide array of artists including big headliners like Carrie Underwood. The blonde country princess will be performing along with some other pop-country crossover favorites, such as Luke Bryan and Eric Church. 
One of the most talked about acts is country heartthrob Sam Hunt. His emotional yet personable songs, such as “House Party” and “Leave the Night On,” are the perfect mix of country, pop and rock. His recent rise to fame in the last year or so has coincided with the release of his debut album Montevallo. His success is no shock in the music industry as the newly solo artist used to write songs for artists such as Kenny Chesney and Keith Urban. 
Another interesting act performing at this year’s festival will be Madisen Ward and the Mama Bear. This mother-and-son folk duo will be performing songs off their first album Skeleton Crew. Aside from performing at several notable venues, singer-songwriter and guitarist Madisen Ward and mother Ruth reached fame all the way in the U.K. this summer. Their interesting dynamic will bring a fresh and fun feel to this year’s set at Stagecoach. 
One artist at Stagecoach this year hasn’t released an album since 2013 but proves no less talented as a country music uber star. Amanda Shires, a singer and songwriter who was circulating the radios since 2005, has performed with other country and folk artists all around the country. Since her 2013 album, Down Fell the Doves, Amanda has been traveling the country with bands like Sleepy Horses. 
Whether you are attending Stagecoach to see heartthrob Sam Hunt or some of the smaller stage acts, the lineup for 2016 is sure to impress. This year is featuring one of the largest and most diverse groups of country and folk artists. Mother-son duos and full bands provide a dynamic stage setup for each act and entertainment for all. Stagecoach is going to bring new and upcoming artists to the forefront of country for the best show yet.

The Trojans were all but ruled out against the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame on a cold Saturday night in South Bend. The program is considered to be in shambles by many (overreaction much?) and the glory days of USC are long gone. But the atmosphere on campus was as good as one can hope. There was a rally for the players and I honestly believe we went in confident against the Fighting Irish. It was a good performance from the Trojans, one that exuded effort and a desperation to get out of this rut that we have been in during the beginning of the season. But we fell short. And as much as I love the effort, I know the players and coaches know that USC can’t accept a “good try”. At USC we win, and we have a commitment to excellence. But we have to know when we just don’t have what it takes. The rest of the season will be telling on what kind of state the program is in right now. It will be telling of whether Coach Clay Helton gets a shot at the head coaching job. It will be telling if USC is on its way back to the USC of old. For now, all we can do is hope.
Grades:
Quarterbacks: B-
Running Backs: B
Wide Receivers: B
Offensive Line: C-
Defensive Line: C
Linebackers: C+
Secondary: D
Special Teams: C
Overall: C+
Prediction: USC 31- Utah 35
Fight On!
You should also rate the coaches.  The new coach is inexperienced and so USC lost to Notre Dame.  Henceforth, USC may not lose any more matches in this season, and that is  a more believable prediction.
A “C” for special teams? Did you miss the blocked punt that went for a touchdown?!? 4 different guys could have blocked that kick. That play alone should drop the grade to a “D”. That was more egregious than missing a 40 yard field goal at the half.

Dear Tiffany, 
The other day I was walking along the street by a group of young men. I walked by, and they proceeded to whistle and shout things. Ugh. I was so disgusted. Naturally, I gave them the bird and kept walking. However, I thought about it later and I realized that maybe this wasn’t the best response. They just chuckled to themselves and said “ooooh.” Maybe I gave them exactly the reaction they were looking for. Should I have gone up to them and given them a piece of my feminist mind? Should I have ignored them? 
Sincerely, 
Not a cat; tired of being cat-called
First and foremost, gauge your safety in each situation before you do anything. In circumstances where you feel it is reasonably safe to say something, you’ve got to determine your end goal. From your chosen course of action, it seems like your desired outcome is to stick it right back to these hecklers. But as you have learned, they are often more amused than anything. 
You might also wish to change their behavior and open their eyes to the patriarchy. You could attempt to do so by telling them that, contrary to what they might think, you are not looking for affirmation and feel extremely disrespected. Unfortunately, this might also result in their amusement. 
In an attempt to stoke a feminist epiphany, you might attempt to humanize yourself by asking them what they think about their parent/sibling/friend getting hollered at in such a way. Though this might be effective, it still doesn’t change their objectifying outlook. 
And then there is just ignoring them. Though this might seem like condonation, it might be best to not give them any attention at all. It would be great if it was possible to engage these young men in a respectful dialogue about why street harassment is the worst.  Sadly, those who catcall are not likely to consider your points, admit their folly and become a changed person. But if you still want to challenge a catcaller (in a safe way) and make them feel on the defensive temporarily, this feminist is down for the cause.
Hi Tiffany!
A few years back, my sister and I lost our parents in a tragic accident. She’s older than me and she took it pretty hard, mainly because she felt like it was her responsibility to become the “head of our family” and pick up where my parents left off taking care of me. 
I really appreciate everything she’s done for me, but she’s always been kind of aloof, and now, with all this extra work she’s been doing, I barely see her at all! She’s about to get a promotion, and while I’m happy for her, she’s really starting to freak out about all the pressure. At one point, she messed up at her job, and she ran away and decided she was going to live as a hermit in the mountains! I had to go out and bring her back, and I told her that I loved her no matter what, but she just wouldn’t listen! I almost froze to death trying to get her to come back!
I’m really worried about how to ease her nerves about screwing up. Do you have any advice on how to calm her down and convince her that, no matter what, she’s still the best sister ever?
I’m very sorry to hear about your parents. Sticking with your sister despite her icy behavior will help her battle her anxiety and just let it go. Have you tried spending some time together to show your true love? With El Niño approaching, building a snowman might be a good option.

Fight on through your mid-semester slump. Cody Uyeda | Daily Trojan
Now in week eight, the semester is already half over. For many, this is when school really starts to hit hard. You may feel like you’re completely lost in that class that should have been a piece of cake, or maybe you’re starting to question if that club you were so keen on joining back in August is still worth your time after all.
If this is you, you’re not alone. As stress, midterms and sleepless nights wear down on all of our resolves, it’s easy to feel like everything’s falling apart or that there’s no way you can possibly get everything done. However, the reality is that your workload often seems much worse than it actually is. They key to pushing through when you feel like you’re trapped in this mid-semester slump is finding ways to reframe your point of view to put everything in perspective. Here are three tried and true methods to help you make it through to finals:
1. Be realistic about where you stand in your classes
At this point, you’ve likely completed enough assignments that your grades are quickly becoming set one way or another. It should be becoming clear if that A is attainable, or if you’re hoping for a B-. This is the point in the semester when students start to really stress over grades, but one of the best ways to beat this senseless worrying is to simply be realistic. So maybe you bombed that midterm and an A is no longer in reach, but how about an
 A-? Deep down we often know intuitively the outcome of our situation, but fear, pride and anger keep us from accepting reality. Instead, take a moment, set aside your pride and accept where you stand in your classes. Nothing kills your drive more than feeling like a class isn’t worth it because you can’t get the grade you want anymore. If you hold onto this negative mindset, the next seven weeks will be torture, guaranteed. So, accept where you stand and be realistic about what you can still achieve. It sounds silly to say, but it is truly amazing how much stress simply disappears when you set realistic goals.
2. Take time to hang out with those who truly matter
Though we all go through the same general pattern of midterms and papers each semester, it can often seem as though no one quite understands how you feel when you say you’re struggling. It may seem like no one is there for you when you really need some support. Too often, we get caught up in the rush of classes, clubs and events, and lose track of the fact that a real, heartfelt conversation with a true friend can do so much more than a hundred conversations with people who aren’t close enough to know or care about your struggles. So, take the time this week to get lunch with that friend you haven’t seen on campus lately, or schedule that dinner date you keep putting off. Being able to laugh, talk and confide in someone who truly knows you is often the cure you didn’t know you needed to get your mind back on track.
3. Go on an adventure off campus
With midterms and assignments perpetually on the horizon, going on an adventure can seem counterintuitive. However, sometimes getting away from it all (literally) can be just what you need to collect your thoughts and recharge. One of USC’s greatest assets is being so close to everything that L.A. has to offer, so take full advantage of that opportunity and go somewhere you’ve never been before. Being in an unfamiliar environment will  help you reframe your perspectives. It will take your minds off all your worries. Even something as simple as taking the metro downtown and wandering the streets of Downtown L.A. for a few hours can leave you feeling more refreshed and inspired than any energy drink or nap can.
The semester may be feeling more difficult, but that doesn’t mean you have to let it get to you. It’s all about the way you approach your stress, and how you choose to frame your perspective.
