Three members of the USC men’s tennis team participated in the Battle at the Bay Tournament in San Francisco, Calif. over the weekend.
Freshman Nick Crystal had a strong showing at the tournament, reaching the quarterfinals before falling to Cal freshman Andre Goransson, 6-3, 7-5.
Sophomore Max de Vroome and junior Eric Johnson were both ousted in the Round of 32 at the tournament.
USC head coach Peter Smith stayed positive about his players’ performance in the tournament, saying that the individual tournament was more of a tune-up for the rigors of the spring team schedule.
“You really just want to give kids a chance to be successful. We’ve got different tournaments coming up, and it’s just about getting them reps, really,” Smith said.
The importance of individual tournaments is also compounded for de Vroome, who suffered from a devastating wrist injury late last season and has had to rehabilitate during the offseason. This weekend was the sophomore’s second tournament since returning from the injury in which he was able to play at full speed. Smith said despite the loss, the signs were encouraging.
“He’s only been really hitting for two weeks, so he still has to get the rust out,” Smith said.
There were no such injury issues for Johnson, who has struggled since midway through last season. Johnson began the 2012 season ranked No. 61 by the Intercollegiate Tennis Association and finished the season ranked No. 85. It was a difficult tournament for the junior, who had a No. 2 seeding and a first round bye only to suffer a crushing exit in the second round at the hands of Stanford sophomore Anthony Tsodikov by a score of 6-0, 6-4.
The USC men’s tennis team is coming off a disappointing season in which they began the 2012 season as the ITA’s No. 2 ranked team and the defending NCAA Champions and ended the season bowing out of the 2013 NCAA Tournament in the quarterfinals to No. 5 Ohio State. Despite this, Smith denies that the players’ subpar performance in the individual tournaments has anything to do with an emotional letdown from last season.
“Neither [Johnson nor de Vroome] played much tennis since July, so that’s why they were out there — to get matches,” Smith said.
Johnson and de Vroome might have to shake off some rust between now and the beginning of the team season next spring, but one player has impressed Smith coming off the offseason — senior Michael Grant. Grant has shown great strides in improving areas of his game and, according to Smith, looks poised for a huge senior year. When asked whether Grant had undergone a special training regimen in the offseason to warrant such optimism, Smith was playful in response.
“I don’t know what the heck he did. He didn’t work with me over the summer — maybe that was the key,” Smith said, laughing.
Hopefully the Trojans have much more to laugh about in the coming weeks as the individual tournaments and “reps” yield more favorable results. Johnson, de Vroome, Grant and the rest of the USC men’s tennis team will participate in the ITA Southwest Regional Championships in Malibu from Oct. 19 to Oct. 22.

With USC interim head coach Ed Orgeron roaming the sidelines and radiating energy, it certainly felt like the dawn of a new, bright era in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Thursday night.
Offensive coordinator Clay Helton helped redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler turn in arguably the best game of his young career in cardinal and gold. A wider variety of aggressive downfield plays were called for Kessler to unleash upon an overmatched Wildcat defense that was deftly deconstructed even without the presence of junior wideout Marqise Lee.
The Coliseum was about 30,000 short of its capacity with 64,215 fans in attendance — but the fans who did show up seemed to be buzzing with excitement about the possibility of a rejuvenated USC squad that could play with the best of the Pac-12.
But all the positive vibes that built up through the first three-and-a-half quarters almost came crashing down due to USC’s pass defense, which looked just as bad as it did against Arizona State.
Even though his team lost, Arizona quarterback B.J. Denker had a career night against USC’s beleaguered secondary.
Denker had not shown competence as a pocket passer entering Thursday night, averaging just 111.3 passing yards per game this season. Against UNLV, a lowly team that lost to Minnesota and Arizona by a combined score of 109-36, Denker could only muster 81 passing yards while completing eight of 21 attempts.
But against the Trojans, Denker experienced unprecedented success.
By halftime, Denker had set a new career-high in passing yards (209). By the final whistle, Denker had racked up 363 yards while completing 28 of 44 attempts. He also threw four touchdown passes against the Trojans after he had thrown just two in his first four games combined. Two of those touchdown passes gained 57 and 45 yards even though he entered the game with a career-long pass completion of 31 yards.
Even USC’s run defense wasn’t top-notch against the Wildcats, as running back Ka’Deem Carey averaged 6.6 yards per carry while gaining 138 rushing yards. Arizona’s offense set season highs for total offense (508 yards) and tied its season high with 25 first downs.
Denker partly attributed the team’s success to a fatigued USC defense, which is certainly a possibility considering USC’s depth issues.
“I felt like they were gassed, especially their front four,” Denker said. “And you could see what they were going to do when they were so tired. It was all about tempo and all about them and their conditioning, and we pushed the pace.”
But I believe it’s about more than that. USC did not let Denker rack up the most passing yards in his collegiate career by halftime simply because they were tired.
In fact, USC’s front four performed admirably. Sophomore defensive end Leonard Williams finished with a team-leading 12 tackles, the most any Trojan had made in a game this season. Junior defensive end J.R. Tavai had the best game of his career, finishing with 10 tackles and 3.5 tackles for loss.
But USC’s secondary showed why it was the team’s biggest question mark heading into the season. Denker was consistently forced out of the pocket by the Trojans’ strong pass rush, but he often improvised and found an open receiver downfield.
“There were some concerns, seems like some easy drives there where we did not play very well,” Orgeron said. “We will make some changes [in] personnel [and] fix things.”
In one particularly egregious mistake late in the second quarter, redshirt junior safety Dion Bailey let Arizona wideout Nate Phillips sneak behind him and reel in a 57-yard touchdown pass just before halftime.
In the fourth quarter, with the Wildcats driving and everyone in the stadium knowing that they’d have to pass to keep their hopes alive, freshman safety Su’a Cravens was beat on a wheel route that let Arizona reduce the deficit to 38-31 with 4:18 remaining.
The unit had temporarily warded off concerns about making costly errors like those by intercepting six passes in the team’s first two games, but the Trojans have recorded just one interception since the loss to Washington State.
“If they’re passing on us, the D-line is not pressuring the quarterback enough, and if the secondary is getting beat, they’re not covering enough,” senior defensive end Devon Kennard said. “We have to fix it. This is the second game in a row this has happened.”
Thankfully for USC, senior tailback Silas Redd closed the door on the Wildcats by running out the clock on the Trojans’ final drive, preventing another heartbreaking loss.
But if that last drive had stalled, every member of the Trojan faithful would have been on the edge of their seats, praying that USC’s suddenly porous secondary wouldn’t give up another lead.
The Trojans haven’t even faced their toughest test of the season in terms of prestigious, pass-heavy offenses. Oregon State quarterback Sean Mannion (2,511 passing yards, first in the nation) and California quarterback Jared Goff (2,036, fourth in the nation) still loom on the schedule, as does quarterback Brett Hundley of UCLA. The Bruins are unbeaten and ranked No. 9 in the AP Poll, and Hundley is among the top Heisman Trophy candidates in the country.
So what will the stat sheet look like after the Trojans have to confront those guys? If defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, who doubles as USC’s secondary coach, doesn’t figure out how to restore the team’s defensive prowess, we might not have witnessed the worst part of this season just yet. And with all the turmoil that’s already plagued USC’s 2013 campaign, that’s a scary thought.

The USC women’s volleyball team rolled to its ninth straight win Friday, cruising to a 3-0 victory over Oregon State (25-11, 25-15, 25-15) to open a four-game road trip.
Upper hand · Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio led the Women of Troy with 10 kills in USC’s 3-0 win against Oregon State. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio led the USC attack once again, notching 10 kills and a stellar six service aces with a hitting percentage of .429. She has already matched her 2012 total with 43 aces, which ranks seventh all-time in USC history.
Senior middle blocker Alexis Olgard continued her dominance at the net with seven kills and four blocks. Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu also added seven kills, while junior middle blocker Hannah Schraer and junior outside hitter Emily Young combined for 10 kills and nine blocks to push the team to 15-1, their best season-opening mark since 2006 when they started 17-1.
The Women of Troy stormed out of the gate in the first set, jumping to a 13-5 lead on an Olgard kill before consecutive OSU errors pushed USC ahead 15-5. USC then advanced to a commanding 22-9 lead after Bricio knocked down her first ace of the match, and then sealed the frame 25-11 with another Bricio ace and an OSU service error.
The Beavers strengthened their game in the second set but failed to keep up with a potent USC offense. OSU kept the Women of Troy in check early, but USC maintained close leads of 11-9 and then 17-14 following a Schraer kill. USC widened the gap from here, going up 22-14 on a service ace by Bricio. Olgard and Schraer combined on a block to seal the set at 25-15 to end a dominant 13-3 run. The Women of Troy also improved their hitting percentage to .370 in the middle frame from a .226 clip in the opening set.
USC ended any hopes of an OSU comeback with a strong third set. Consecutive Bricio kills gave the Women of Troy an 11-8 lead, but the Beavers would not go lightly. USC turned a slim 12-10 lead into a 20-15 advantage with a combined block from Young and Schraer. The Women of Troy never looked back, stringing together five straight points to take the third set 25-15 and clinch the match.
The Women of Troy improved to 5-0 in Pac-12 play, also their best mark since the 2006 squad started its season 6-0 in conference play. The team also improved to an impressive 46-8 all time against the Beavers, including nine consecutive victories and sweeps in eight straight matchups. The win marks the 1,199th professional victory in head coach Mick Haley’s illustrious career.
After playing at Oregon on Sunday night, USC will continue its four-game road trip with a visit to Arizona. The Women of Troy face off against Arizona State on Friday and Arizona on Sunday. Last season, USC lost 3-0 to the Sun Devils in Tempe but won its match against Arizona in Tucson by a score of 3-1.

The Vavic family has often been referred to as “the first family of water polo,” and the accuracy of that title was further cemented this weekend.
Peak performer · On Sunday, senior driver Nikola Vavic passed Juraj Zatovic as USC’s all-time leading scorer. Vavic led the Trojans in 2012 with 83 goals and was a finalist for the Peter J. Cutino Award for the nation’s top player. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Senior driver Nikola Vavic entered Sunday’s final day of the SoCal Tournament just one goal away from taking over as USC’s all-time scoring leader, a title held by Juraj Zatovic, who amassed an incredible 220 goals over the course of his four years as a Trojan from 2002 to 2005.
He took the all-time lead in the Trojans victory over the University of the Pacific on Sunday, which also put USC in the championship game late Sunday night.
Vavic moved from 215 to 220 goals on the opening day of tournament play, which saw the Trojans win two games in impressive fashion against two ranked opponents.
In the first game, USC was matched up against St. Francis Brooklyn, which entered the tournament as the No. 16-ranked team in the nation. Junior driver Kostas Genidounias led the Trojans with three goals, but was only one of four Trojans who finished the game with multiple goals. Senior goalie James Clark and redshirt junior goalie Paul Mitre shared time in the cage, and both were impressive, holding the Terriers to just four goals on the day.
Following their 13-4 victory, USC took down another ranked opponent, this time No. 7-ranked Long Beach State, to earn a spot in the semifinals on Sunday. Clark was again dominant in goal, holding the 49ers to just two goals through the first three quarters. Redshirt sophomore Aleck Ryner finished off the game, and the Trojans won handily by a margin of 14-7.
Vavic scored two goals against St. Francis Brooklyn and collected a hat trick in the second game.
The semifinals meeting between USC and Pacific was the first of two games the schools are set to play this season, as the teams are scheduled to play in early November in Stockton, Calif. Pacific, which had to beat Santa Clara and UC Santa Barbara for the right to play USC in the semifinal, put up a valiant fight before eventually falling 10-6.
In last season’s SoCal Tournament, the Trojans knocked off UC Irvine in the semifinals and UC Santa Barbara in the finals to earn their ninth SoCal Tournament championship in 10 years. USC finished fourth in the tournament in 2011.
Pacific entered the match ranked No. 3 in the nation, with just one loss to date, making it an impressive win for the Trojans. USC put up five goals in the second quarter after trailing in the first and never looked back, finishing off the Tigers and clinching a spot in the championship game against the crosstown rival UCLA Bruins.
The two teams have historically been ranked among the best water polo programs in the nation, and always seem to have very comparable squads. Last year’s NCAA championship saw the Trojans win in dramatic 10-9 fashion over the Bruins, a game that was very similar to the 9-8 loss in the NorCal finals just two weeks ago.
In that game, Vavic was held to just one goal, but the Rancho Palos Verdes native has been a stalwart for the Trojans and USC head coach Jovan Vavic since the day he arrived on campus. As a freshman, Nikola led USC in scoring with 49 goals and scored in all but three games that year. In his sophomore season, Vavic was second on the team with 41 goals. Vavic exploded for a team-high 83 goals last season, and is on pace to eclipse that mark this season.
When the pressure has been at its highest, Vavic has earned a reputation for stepping his game up. He has been on the NCAA All-Tournament team every year as a Trojan, and scored a hat trick in the championship game as a freshman. Vavic has been a crucial part of USC’s record-setting five straight national championships, and will need to have another big year if the Trojans are to win a sixth straight this year.
In his historic junior season, Vavic was honored as a first-team All-American and was a first-team selection on the All-Mountain Pacific Sports Federation team. Vavic was also named a finalist for the Peter J. Cutino Award, an honor given to the nation’s best player.
Adding to his list of accomplishments, Vavic has represented USC internationally as well, competing as a member of the U.S. National Team at the UANA World Aquatic Championship Qualification Tournament. Additionally, he was the third leading scorer at the 2009 FINA Men’s Junior World Championships.

USC students participated in the annual AIDS Walk Los Angeles in West Hollywood on Sunday.
The walk, in which about 30,000 people participated, was organized by AIDS Project Los Angeles, a group that hopes to improve the lives of those fighting HIV/AIDS while raising awareness through various events.
USC’s Undergraduate Student Government’s Community Affairs Committee organized transportation for students to participate in Sunday’s AIDS Walk Los Angeles in West Hollywood.
“We’re not specifically endorsing the walk, we’re just providing transportation for USC members in a safe way. We’ve been doing it every year so it has just become tradition to do it,” said Kandace London, USG’s director of community affairs. “We provided transportation by offering two to three buses all paid for by Undergraduate Student Government.”
USG began offering this service after they learned that every year numerous USC students wanted to attend the walk but were unable to make it because of a lack of transportation. Since then, they said they have tried to accommodate student needs.
“We made it our mission to make sure that anyone who wanted to participate in it would have a free way to get there,” London said.
Students said they took advantage of USG’s services for various reasons. Levi Powell, a junior majoring in dental hygiene, participated because he believed this event would bring  his fraternity together, while also helping a good cause.
“I chose to attend this event for two reasons, in support of my fraternity and to spend my time on something worthwhile,” said powell. “It’s the start of our ‘Kappa Week’ at my fraternity [Kappa Alpha Psi], where we do different events everyday throughout the week.”
Powell’s fraternity brother, Bryen Irving agreed with him.
“Our fraternity feels it’s important to reach out to the community. I’ve heard about the walk because I’m from L.A.,” said Irving, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering. “It was powerful to see this many people turn out for a cause like this, and this isn’t a one-time thing because they are bringing people out like this every year.”
Other students were excited to spend time with different groups from outside of the USC community.
“I had never experienced the coming together of such a diverse group. It was definitely eye-opening to see how such a big city could unite to help others,” said Riyana Chakraborty, a member of USG Community Affairs.
Many celebrities also participated, including stars of the ABC television show, Revenge, and famous personalities such as Richard Simmons. Hundreds of people gathered for the opening ceremonies as these stars spoke about how AIDS has affected them and the importance of acceptance.
Numerous companies also donated their products to encourage the walkers. Companies such as Evolution Fresh and Gatorade donated millions of bottles of their products to be passed along to participants as they made their way toward the finish line.
USG Community Affairs member Evelyn Lee appreciated the hundreds of volunteers who gathered along the path handing out snacks, fresh fruit and drinks.
“I think it was really encouraging to have people not only constantly keeping you hydrated, but also cheering for the entire path to the finish line,” Lee said. “They stood along the sidelines giving high-fives and telling people to drink water and stay healthy.”
Students who participated in the walk said they were happy to see such a diverse group come together for a cause.
“It surprised me how much people care for one another,” Chakraborty said. “I am proud to live in a place like Los Angeles where people are accepting and the opportunities for change are so limitless.”

Saturday marked the 8th annual Los Angeles Archives Bazaar, where organizations such as the Venice Heritage Foundation, Getty Research Institute and the University of California, Irvine Libraries Special Collections set up public exhibitions in Doheny Memorial Library.

This is the fourth year the event has been held at Doheny and its sixth year at USC. The event is hosted by the USC Libraries and planned by L.A. as Subject, a research alliance that connects more than 230 archival collections held by both institutions and individuals. The only requirement to participate in the bazaar is to hold a collection that focuses on Los Angeles.
“It’s so important to instill a sense of place into the next generation,” said Todd von Hoffman, president of the Venice Heritage Foundation. “When [people] have a sense of pride of where they live, they are much more apt to […] impart that enthusiasm and respect for history unto the next generation.”
The event hosted many exhibits highlighting parts of California history in unique ways, including a display that was distinguished by a large basketball-sized plastic orange looming more than 6 feet above the ground. David Boulé used the exhibit to display his extensive research on the California orange and his latest book, in which he examines the impact of the orange on California’s agricultural industry and our cultural image of California.
Special events and panels were also held throughout the day, such as “Craft Brewing in L.A.: Tastes and Traditions.” In this panel, brewmaster Dieter Foerstner of Angel City Brewery discussed the history of American beer, the resurgence of craft brewing in Los Angeles and the birth of some of the brewery’s more quirky brews: the “Avocado Ale,” inspired by guacamole, and the “French Sip,” a brew crafted to taste like au jus.
Later in the day, participants were provided a preview to The Good Giants, a documentary about the Buffalo Soldiers, an all-black regiment of the army, and the irony behind their liberation of Italian villages in WWII while being treated as second-class citizens in America.
Inspired by PBS’ Antiques Roadshow, the Los Angeles Preservation Network held their own “Archives Roadshow” at this year’s bazaar. Here, individuals could bring their documents and photographs of historical significance, and have them examined and digitized by professional archivists. Participants also received instructions on how to best handle and preserve their documents.
The bazaar has recently grown in recognition among those who work in history, and also has much to offer for the participating institutions.
“There are 10 percent more exhibitors each year,” said Liza Posas, coordinator for L.A. as Subject. “It gives them an opportunity to evolve how they promote their institution. [The exhibitors] have learned how to articulate themselves and make their exhibits fun and relevant. It’s a networking opportunity.”
The event participants hail primarily from the greater Los Angeles community. Many professional archivists and historians as well as history buffs and students from other colleges attended. Many of the historians emphasized how important history is to education at all levels.
“Where’s the first place the government cuts in a crisis? Library and archives. Math and science are heavily valued, but history is also important,” said Nancy Saul-Larson, an archivist and historian with the Topanga Historical Society.
Kevin Lopez, a junior majoring in chemical biology, entered Doheny Library in search of books for his Writing 340 class, but soon struck up into a conversation with the Genealogical Society of Hispanic America.
“I really appreciate the interest for people to document the past,” Lopez said. “Preservation of culture through technology, and its ability to help me develop connections with my heritage, really caught my interest.”
For Jessica Zhou, a freshman majoring in business administration, the sheer amount of history in Los Angeles was what drew her to the event.
“I’ve always liked history,” Zhou said. “This may or may not become a hobby for me, but will I be back next year? Definitely.”
Posas was excited that students were interested in the subject and getting involved.
“Everybody has history,” Posas said. “We don’t have to celebrate the history of those who conquered, those who win, those who are stars, but the everyday person. I hope people understand that it starts with their history, and ripples outward into an engagement with history.”

USC professor Gina Nahai has filed a workplace discrimination and harassment lawsuit against USC and the director of USC Dornsife’s Master of Professional Writing Program, Brighde Mullins.
Mullins has been director for five years and is an award-winning playwright and poet.  Nahai, a 1988 graduate from the MPW program and award-winning author of four novels, has been an adjunct professor at the university since 1999.
The lawsuit, filed at the Los Angeles Superior Court in September, claims that Nahai has been “systematically discriminated against because she is an Iranian Jew by the bigoted Director of the Master Writing Program.”
The suit claims that Mullins had been “openly hostile and dismissive” to Nahai from their first meeting in 2008, the year Mullins was made director of the MPW program. It lists multiple occasions of alleged discrimination by Mullins toward Nahai.
In one instance in early 2009, Mullins reportedly denied Nahai the opportunity to visit local departments and universities to promote the MPW program. When pressed on the matter by Nahai, Mullins allegedly replied, “It’s important to have the right face to represent us.”
Another occurrence claims that Mullins supposedly removed Nahai from marketing materials related to the program. The record claims it was Mullins’ intention “to render [Nahai] invisible.”
As time went on, Mullins allegedly attempted to cut Nahai’s compensation to “less than living wages.” Mullins cited budgetary restrictions, but the lawsuit states that at the same time “Mullins was hiring new teachers” and “expeditiously got rid of 10 of the most senior members of the faculty.”
In the fall of 2010, Nahai allegedly confronted Mullins about her discriminatory behavior toward her and other older faculty members. Mullins allegedly “admitted that she should not have gotten rid of older employees,” and told Nahai, “You people [Iranian Jews] are very ambitious.”
On multiple occasions, the lawsuit cites Mullins as making discriminatory remarks toward Nahai, referring to Nahai and Iranian Jews as “you people.” The court filing states that Mullins “meant prejudiced negative traits associated with Iranian Jews.”
The lawsuit also claims that Nahai’s career has been “crippled,” and that Mullins refused to promote Nahai to assistant professor even though “she is the most qualified candidate.”
In the spring of 2010, Mullins allegedly attempted to change the status of the MPW from a terminal to non-terminal degree. A terminal degree is the highest degree that can be achieved in a field.
According to the lawsuit, Nahai was the only faculty member with this degree, and the decision “effectively would prevent [Nahai] from advancement to the title of Assistant Professor for not holding a terminal degree.”
Within the last three months, the lawsuit claims that Nahai’s name “has been removed as a faculty member of the Associated Writing Program,” allegedly harming both herself and her professional reputation.
The lawsuit states, “[Nahai] seeks only to be able to continue to teach, a true love in her life, and thrive in a discrimination-free work environment.”
The filing also accuses the university of not properly responding to the discriminatory accusations.
As a result of these alleged abuses, Nahai is claiming the loss of multiple benefits, salaries and promotional opportunities. She is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief against future discrimination.
Due to pending litigation, Mullins would not comment on the allegations. USC Vice Provost Martin Levine released a statement on the lawsuit to the Daily Trojan.
“Ms. Nahai’s allegations have been looked into seriously within the university,” the statement said. “Considerations of privacy prevent me from going into the specific facts, but USC’s policy is to make all academic decisions on academic grounds, through established processes and committees, and consistent with our values.”
USC’s Office of General Counsel has also released a statement to Jewish Journal earlier this month.
“The university is committed to a teaching and learning environment free from unlawful harassment and discrimination. Ms. Nahai had already made her claims known to the university prior to filing this lawsuit, and the university has determined that they are wholly without merit,” the statement said. “The university is proud of its diverse and talented MPW faculty, including its director, Ms. Brighde Mullins, and will vigorously defend against these unfounded allegations.”
Tracy Chabala, a student of the MPW program from 2005 to 2008, said that she and fellow alumni were shocked over the allegations and the university’s stance.
“It was all very surprising to us now that it’s gone public,” Chabala said. “I found it troubling that the university would put more faith in this new director instead of showing loyalty to one of its alums.”
Chabala wrote a letter to President C. L. Max Nikias regarding her concerns over how the university has handled Nahai’s case.
“It’s on behalf of all the other students because we’ve been in casual contact with each other and everyone is pretty shocked,” she said.

You can tell we’re writers, because our responses just go on and on :-) And again, I have to jump in.  Tracy, it is in NO WAY disrespectful to say I don’t know you and you don’t speak for me. As you are aware, those are simple statements of fact. There was nothing in anything I said that even hinted that you shouldn’t speak positively on Gina’s behalf. You and I did exactly the same thing which was speak positively about what we believed. There is nothing wrong with that, and nothing I said indicates otherwise.
The additional fact that you haven’t been in the program for five years hasn’t nothing to do with connection to or dedication to USC but was specifically about the quoted statement that you speak for all of us, i.e. how could someone who isn’t even here and hasn’t been for years claim to speak for students she doesn’t even know.
     And on that subject, I note that you said both you “never INTENDED” to speak for all the students and also that you “did not say all of the students or at least [you] DID NOT MEAN TO.”  I’m sure you know that this makes it appear that, according to you, you very well may have said what I was reacting to. But let’s assume that you didn’t. That leads to the possibility (which you present as fact with several of the statements you make) that you were either deliberately or somehow unintentionally misquoted.  And if that’s the case; if this writer intentionally took what you said to him, reworded it, and put it into quotation marks in such a way as to make what you said sound “ridiculous”–your word; then I don’t understand why you’re defending how this piece was constructed. I would think you’d be more upset than anyone.
     I am neither naive, nor am I blind. I note, Austin, that you begin your letter by pledging your support for Gina and end it by warning not to blindly pledge support. I understand that, because, like me, you don’t believe you’re totally blind in this matter. You both feel you know Gina well enough to support her on these issues. You both also say you don’t know Brighde. I know them both (as stated in my original comment), and like you, wasn’t there behind closed doors. So, also like you, I am basing what I say, my support, on my gut feelings and my interactions with both over these years. I hold no animus toward Gina whatsoever, but like you, I have beliefs based on what I have seen and experienced.
And by the way, Austin, Gina is still teaching at USC and is on the website.
I am a 2012 graduate of the MPW program and would also like to pledge my support behind Professor Gina Nahai. Though she did have incredibly high standards, more so than some of the other professors in the program, I came to value that because I learned so much more from her. I loved her honest feedback and genuine concern for her students so much that after the first workshop I took with her in the Spring of 2012 I signed up for two more of her courses before graduation. 
Gina stuck up for us and the value of our degrees and was apparently punished for it if she is no longer teaching at USC. The question you should be investigating is why Brighde wanted to devalue our degrees. Brighde is not an MPW grad and devaluing our degrees would not affect her. Our degrees would no longer be seen as an equivalent of an MFA, more like a technical certificate, and hurt all of us professionally in an already dismal economy. Because it would hurt the program and all of its alumni, what other reason could Brighde possibly have to do that other than to keep Gina from receiving tenure? What else could Brighde gain by requiring every MPW alum to also earn an MFA after entering the program under a different pretense to be seen on equal footing with our competitors? I am not making assumptions or accusations here, the facts seem to speak for themselves. I would love to know if there is a logical explanation at all. I personally cannot think of one.
I cannot say with conviction whether Brighde is racist or bigoted as I do not know her personally. I only came into contact with her during program-wide lectures and social events, where she did come across as warm and caring, but I never had her as a professor. Usually people who are racist or bigoted, however, go to great lengths to hide their prejudice and come up with pretext excuses. That is why the Civil Rights Act was created. Just because some students may be unaware of their professors’ prejudices does not mean they do not exist. 
Allegedly Brighde also forced John Rechy off the faculty and fought his discrimination claims as well. If you are unfamiliar with Rechy’s work, he was a pioneer in LGBT and Chicano literature.
I mean you no disrespect but before you blindly pledge your support to either Gina or Brighde, I would recommend finding out the whole story.
Dear Tracy ~
Thanks for clarifying your comments.  I, like you, am not in a position to comment about what happens behind closed doors.  I am addressing three things:  a) It would be a shame if scholarship suffers because of a one-sided portrait in an investigation that is still pending.  (Just do a simple word count of the blaming and shaming implications within the text. ) If this were a school paper, I would imagine it would be a good example to examine for fair reporting.   b) What is our obligation as artists to the truth?  Yes, truth can be a dense thorny bush, but it is not a stick figure, unless you are a Steinberg or a Picasso.  As aspiring journalists and writers, who have an opportunity to be in print through a school paper and expose our words for mass consumption, we have to tell it like it is;  but tell it in 3-D, with well-researched arguments on both sides, empathy for the subjects discussed, fairness and concern for everyone depicted.   I just did not think this particular portrait was fair.   I still feel it was muckraking and unnecessarily inflammatory.  But, that is just my opinion.
Hey everyone, yeah, I wrote a letter to the president on behalf of Gina’s character.  I said nothing of Mullins.  I told this writer that I wrote the letter on behalf of my FRIENDS who agree with me about the situation.  I did not say all of the students, or at least I did not mean to.  
In any event, we all are entitled to our opinions.  I came forward with my opinion, and I am proud that I did and I am sticking to that and I never EVER intended to say that I speak for all the MPW students.  That’s ridiculous.  But, I wanted to speak on behalf of Gina’s character.
That’s it.  Our convo was a lot longer.  I did not approach this author to print this story. 
Peace.
P.S. Let’s not be so naive to think that, just because we did not witness a particular behavior in someone, it does not exist. Trust, I have seen some pretty shocking things over the years in both my professional life and also in the MPW program itself back in 2007.  
The program was in shambles and nearly fell apart and was ridden with scandal about six or seven years ago.  Obviously, newer students aren’t aware of this.  But let’s not forget the instructors who stuck with the program during that tumultuous time, who fought for its survival, and of course, Gina Nahai was one of them.  This adds to my concern.
To diss me, because I have an opinion, because I spoke out on Gina’s character, like you all are doing for Mullins, is not fair.  To rip this journalist a new one for reporting a pending lawsuit, when he in fact quoted the university’s stance on things, is also unfair.
Imagine the outrage when supporters of Nahai watch a beloved professor of nearly 15 years, with the very MPW degree the whole program is emphatically promoting, who Mullins called “treasured” in an introduction on a panel, is not promoted to Assistant Professor, while there are a bunch of new teachers in there who are??  It seems a bit, well, odd to say the least!
Does this mean those allegations are true?  I’m not a lawyer, and I certainly won’t get into it here, neither will I say a bad word about Mullins, which you will see is not what this is about for me.  But if I want to come forward on Nahai’s behalf, I have the right to, in as much as you all of course have the right to defend Mullins.  And I was 100% honest in my letter to the president that I had no personal complaint with Mullins, that I barely interacted with her, and I even told this writer this.  
No, I have not been at the university for five years.  So? I put in my time and energy and passion five years ago, oh, and I was also the producer and director of the professional writing series.  In fact, under my watch, we finally moved out of the dingy WPH basement and started readings in more interesting venues with faculty members and bestselling alums.
And my father played football for USC under John McKay.  Oh, and I went to USC as an undergrad.  And I worked at the USC Fisher Gallery to pay for my education.  And oh, half my family and extended family went to USC, so I could go on and on about my DEEP investment/connection in the university, too.
It is very naive to think that having handbooks on harassment, training, and policies either prevents it from occurring or can possibly stop it. Harassment can be very subtle, and individual, and extremely insidious.  Believe me.  I have been the recipient.  I have fought my way through my current field and seen plenty of duality in personalities.  None of us know what went on behind closed doors for goodness sake, and yes, that includes me.
I actually appreciate that you guys put in your two cents, as it does add to the article. But the truth is, other publications made the lawsuit public.  He reported it. And he has the right to write about it, and Gina has the right to her side of the story.  And, clearly, USC has the right to promote and hire whomever they choose.
Dear Mr. Lemas,
I so wish I did not have to write this comment, but I feel compelled.  I enjoy reading the “Daily Trojan” for reportage on ongoing events as well as special interest stories at my beloved USC; the school paper has been especially entertaining during moments of procrastination during homework assignments.  At times admittedly, I use the paper to line my birdcage.  
It seems after yesterday’s article, however, I might be using the paper more often to collect bird droppings.  I do not fault the paper, but just wonder how could this have happened?  Your article displays an unfortunate lack of objective reporting regarding an alleged, pending lawsuit against the MPW program, and in particular the inspired department head Professor Mullins. 
My daughter went to USC, my husband taught at USC and I am now a student in the MPW program.  I appreciate USC’s diverse community of students, faculty, and support staff.  It is deeply concerning that you as a journalist appear to have misled your reader.   It seems that you may have not pursued an even-sided account before printing one word.  I have been very impressed with USC with the rigor when it comes to harassment (including annual online training required every year).  
As a Jew I am particularly sensitive to remarks that could undermine me if I let them.  I have had my share of mean remarks.  I agree with the previous two comments in this thread.  Of coures, it is important to investigate any allegations, but to fly the imaginary dirty laundry on our flag-pole, you need to be metaphorically b-slapped.  I have to wonder about the timing on this article?  Was it really necessary to publish this before the other shoe drops? I hope there is an outpouring of outrage, because this kind of name calling in the press — any press — whether in quotation marks or not — is not pretty, even in the spirit of freedom of speech.  The subtext is mean-spirited, inflammatory and one-sided.  I hold our community to a higher standard in the pursuit of truth… in art, science, religion, and journalism.
Carry on, we are all here to learn to be better people, better artists and better scientists.  My request is that you send out a correction/retraction/amendment to this unfortunate, unkind suggested portrait of someone who has only given her blood, tears and complete soul to the MPW program, Bridghe Mullins.  She deserves a medal for her service, not muckraking based on false innuendo.  The “he said/she said” formula does not work when people’s hard earned
careers are on the line.   Get the facts.  Not implications.  ‘Nuff said, back to my homework!
I am a current student in the MPW program and will be submitting my thesis in December. I, like a lot of my peers in the program, was shocked at the allegations in this matter. I was equally shocked at the tenor of the Trojan article which was criminally one-sided. One has to wonder why Mr. Lemas didn’t pick up the phone or walk across campus to at least get a comment from Brighde, or perhaps speak with someone other than Tracy Chabala. Did he even question how she was in a position to speak for “all the other students?”
Let me be clear: I wasn’t a witness to any of the conversations or actions which the lawsuit alleges, so I am not commenting on that, and this is not about those allegations. But let me further clarify: I don’t know Tracy other than as a writer on Gina’s Facebook page, and SHE DOESN’T SPEAK FOR ME. If I need someone to speak on behalf of my 62-year old black ass, I will. . .wait, I DON’T.
So, speaking for myself, here is what I have to say: I had a class with Gina, and I’ve interacted with her across these two plus years, including attending a function at her beautiful home. I’ve also had classes with Brighde and gotten to know her. I’ve interacted with both as the Coordinator of the MPW Student Faculty Readings series and as one of the Organizers of the Second Act Club. I found both of them to be excellent teachers and speakers and amazing writers, each in her own style.
From my personal perspective, I have found Brighde to be warm, welcoming, supportive, and positive. I’ve never seen or heard anything that might indicate the kind of bigotry she is accused of.  And no, I’m not an Iranian Jew, but my experience has been that bigots out themselves sooner or later. I’ve heard from both Middle Eastern and Jewish classmates about this, and I think it would behoove anyone who wonders about the matter to speak with some of them directly, rather than believe one person, who’s been out of the program for five years, speaks for all of us.
I am not “anti-Gina,” because she has the right to her feelings, but I have to share the truth of what I’ve experienced, and the Brighde I’ve known for these years is not the person described in that article.
I see that Brighde was, in fact, approached for a comment, so my apologies for that oversight. I stand by everything else.
Why did you publish an incomplete story? Where’s your work? 
You repeat other people stories. You repeat on what other people told the Jewish Journal last month, but you don’t say Nahai’s connection to the Jewish Journal.
Did you look for students who like MPW program, or Mullins? The sole student in story is Facebook friend of Nahai’s, member of a Twitter group called #ginaswriters, who says on internet over and over she supports Nahai. Did you seek out any students who did not already express a view on this lawsuit, or students who know Mullins?
Did you find out why case is in court and not arbitration? Here’s USC policies from USC website: http://policies.usc.edu/i-alphaindex.html It includes a link to the Faculty handbook, and agreement to arbitrate claims policy. Every faculty signs this. Is Mullins even the decider about promotions in MPW? 
Anti-Semitism is very bad and it is good laws can stop it. Allegations of anti-Semitism are important. But they are not fact. You should report fact.

HackSC, held from Friday to Sunday, was USC’s first ever campus-focused hackathon competition.
Fourteen teams participated in the competition, which was hosted by the USC Association for Computing Machinery, to create technology products for the general student body.
Creativity · A team prepares for HackSC by building a course scheduling site to help students organize the classes each semester – Tony Zhou | Daily Trojan
Aaron Harris, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering and one of the main coordinators of the competition, wanted to create the technological infrastructure that other large universities have. He said his goal was to make USC’s data as accessible to students as possible and to promote a culture of innovation within USC.
“My goal is to encourage students to take charge of their campus,” Harris said. “To have these apps be a part of USC [will] better serve the needs of students.”
The planning of the event started in early September when ACM invited students and faculty to submit ideas for creative uses of technology to improve the system and to increase student wellbeing.
The panel judged the products on Sunday by the following four categories: ease of use, presentation, long-term viability and specificity for USC. The top five teams each received a $100 grant to develop their app further over the following week, during which they must collect from USC students and faculty by hosting tables on Trousdale to demonstrate their products. They will then present their findings, statistics and feedback at a school-wide event at Ground Zero on Thursday at 6 p.m. The winning team will receive a $500 award and support from USC to develop the application further.
Harris, also a HackSC participant, said he hopes these apps will be used at USC to help better serve the needs of students in a meaningful way.
“HackSC is opening the lines of communication between the students’ needs and USC’s ability to meet them,” he said. “One of the overall goals of the hackathon is to create a USC App Store where students, faculty and staff can see which apps can help them better navigate life at USC.”
Christina Chu, a junior majoring in computer science and business administration, also helped coordinate HackSC.
“We hope to make the campus more tech savvy, and we’re targeting both experienced and non-experienced USC students to participate and try their hands at tech,” Chu said. “We wanted new or non-experienced students to have the chance to create something so that in the future they won’t think that technology is something they themselves cannot create.”
ACM also hosted a series of programming workshops throughout last week to better prepare students for the hackathon competition.
Joyce Yan, a freshman majoring in computer science and business administration, said she saw HackSC as a significant way for new programmers to learn.
For the competition, Yan is developing a website application that maps a student’s four-year schedule. She said her product will benefit those who want to add a minor or study abroad but don’t know if they have room in their schedules.
“I think it’s a great way for programmers who are not as experienced to gain experience in real-world applications of programming,” Yan said.
Martin Siron, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering (nanotechnology), is also creating an app that helps students manage their class schedules.
“At first we were going to do a ticketing system for trading football tickets but then we decided to make a website that exports your class schedule to your personal calendar,” Siron said.
Students aren’t only making the apps for practice. Several said they hope to see them used by the university to help the student body.
“I hope USC will recognize the devotion of their students to the campus and will consider incorporating these solutions into their technology infrastructure,” Harris said.
ACM is planning on coordinating a larger hackathon in the spring, in which students from other schools can participate.

The term “indie” is often attributed to the coolest of the cool — those who don brands we’ve never heard of, smoke foreign cigarettes and take pleasure in tempeh burgers and kale.
But me? Well, I’m the least alternative person you will probably meet.
I come from the ultimate suburb — Irvine, Calif. — and I’ve grown up accustomed to shopping at Nordstrom and dining out at chain restaurants.
I don’t buy my clothes at lesser-known boutiques or eat at hole-in-the-wall joints. I don’t do my homework at coffee shops (nor do I drink coffee at all).
I like adventure and a little bit of spontaneity, but order and organization define my life. But on the days that radio hits and chart toppers don’t fit my musical needs, this is the alternative playlist I turn on to satisfy my indie craving.
 

“Day Dreams” — Midi Matilda
In an interview with the Huffington Post, indie-pop duo Midi Matilda stated, “We want our shows to be like Daft Punk meets The White Stripes.” They’ve nailed that goal with their songs, all of which are dance-worthy numbers. These Bay Area boys fuse their smooth vocals with jazzy beats. In this particular track, by splicing traditional instruments like the trumpet with the synthesizer, Midi Matilda serves up a refreshing song. I’m still stumped why an indie director hasn’t scooped this song up as a soundtrack addition for his or her film, but until then, indie lovers can continue to relish in the obscurity of Midi Matilda.
 
“Get Gone” — White Arrows
“Psychotropical pop” is the self-proclaimed genre of White Arrows, a band hailing from Los Angeles. Comparable to the sounds of Tokyo Police Club, White Arrows’ music has the capacity to help listeners unwind and relax. Impressively uplifting lyrics such as, “Don’t forget to tell yourself / Look inside of you and no one else / No one even cares about your health / Just ask my mom / she’s doing well” provide an excellent getaway during hectic times.
 
“Ghost” — Sir Sly
Sir Sly is the brainchild of Landon Jacobs, Jason Suwito and Hayden Coplen. These three Los Angeles natives are so alternative and underground that it’s impossible to find much information about them on the Internet. They’re the band that your indie friends probably don’t openly talk about because who would even think about sharing music, right?
“Always Like This” — Bombay Bicycle Club
British indie-rock band Bombay Bicycle Club can be best described as a happy group of boys producing memorable tracks. Their music is as quirky as their band name, which they took from an Indian restaurant franchise. The band entered the public eye when “Always Like This” made the Top 100 on the U.K. Singles Chart.
 
“Retrograde” — James Blake 
Electronic music producer James Blake integrates haunting R&B vocals with bits of dubstep to create spellbinding tracks. “Retrograde” is the most recent single from his award-winning 2013 album Overgrown. Rapper Kanye West mentored Blake during the composition of “Retrograde” — a lesser-known and surprising fact, given not many alternative fans would expect the man behind mainstream hits such as “Mercy” and “Stronger” would have a hand in a song as indie as this one.
 
“Pumpin Blood” — NONONO
Stina Wäppling, Astma and Rocwell are three Swedish musicians who have banded together to create an eccentric collection of songs. Though I personally feel their other songs aren’t the best of indie tunes (Wäppling’s vocals can be a bit hard to handle at times), “Pumpin Blood” comes out on top as a striking hit.
 
“Toothpaste Kisses” — The Maccabees
Orlando Weeks of The Maccabees has one of the most tender and sincere voices of all English indie-rock artists. The song begins in a memorable manner, with the sound of a match lighting, as if to signal Weeks is singing to his lover over a candlelit dinner. This romantic song, with succinct yet heartfelt lyrics such as, “Cradle me, I’ll cradle you / I’ll win your heart with a woop-a-woo / Pullin’ shapes just for your eyes,” would make any softie swoon.

There’s one adjective that comes to mind when people think of Disney: happy. Many USC students still hang on to an affinity for Disney films and visit Disneyland in nearby Anaheim anytime they have a chance.
So what are overgrown Mouseketeers to make of Escape from Tomorrow, an experimental, “guerilla-style” horror movie that was shot on company property without Mickey’s knowledge or consent?
Escape from Tomorrow is a weird, wonderful work of minor-key genius that challenges the entire notion of de rigueur happiness.
Why does it play so well? Maybe because Disney has always had a dark side — it’s been a monolithic fixture in shaping several generations for more than eight decades and its films are home to arguably the most charming stable of villains in modern fiction — and Randy Moore’s movie brings that darkness into the light, kicking and screaming, with style and rough-hewn ingenuity to spare.
Escape from Tomorrow tells the unhappy tale of Jim (Roy Abramsohn), a sympathetic schlub who loses his job — and quite possibly his remaining ties to sanity — during the final hours of a family vacation to Disney World. Suddenly his wife’s (Elena Schuber) gentle nagging turns shrill and hateful. His son (Jack Dalton) and toddler daughter (Katelynn Rodriguez) recoil from his touch, their eyes cold and accusatory. And to make matters worse, he can’t seem to stop himself from obsessively pursuing two underage French girls (Danielle Safady and Annet Mahendru), who flutter through the park like metal-mouthed nymphs, tempting him to recapture his lost youth — a central theme of the film — in the creepiest manner possible.
With its transformative black-and-white photography and the unsettling tagline “Bad Things Happen Everywhere,” Moore’s bizarro version of the Happiest Place on Earth is a grotesque, plastic-fantastic purgatory, where a façade of manufactured mirth masks all manner of nefarious, illegal and possibly even demonic activities, including the sinister machinations of the Other Woman (Alison Lees-Taylor, channeling Grace Zabriskie), the flesh-and-blood equivalent of Snow White’s Wicked Queen.
In order to accentuate this creeping sense of unease, Moore and director of photography Lucas Lee Graham wisely emulate cinematic surrealists such as David Lynch (Mulholland Dr.) and Alejandro Jodorowsky (El Topo), imbuing even the lighter scenes with an undercurrent of monochrome menace, until every familiar sight and sound takes on a grim new significance. For example, Spaceship Earth — better known as the big Epcot golf ball — is revealed as an Orwellian imagination harvesting facility, while the Disney princesses are portrayed as high-end prostitutes who cater to the desires of lascivious Eastern businessmen. And what happens to one unlucky rider on Big Thunder Mountain is a scene better experienced in theaters than written here.
The only thing more outrageous than the movie itself is how it was made. Wary of being discovered during the shoot, Moore and his crew posed as tourists at both Disneyland and Disney World, using handheld video cameras (including the innocent-looking Canon EOS 5D Mark II) and keeping copies of the script on their iPhones. The first-time director, well aware of Disney’s penchant for being extremely protective of its squeaky clean brand image, even arranged to edit the film in South Korea to keep the project under wraps during its lengthy post-production.
Escape from Tomorrow  premiered last January at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, where it became an overnight sensation — though many attendees voiced their doubts that Disney would ever allow the film to be seen or distributed outside of the festival circuit.
The Mouse House has kept mum on Escape from Tomorrow so far, with the exception of a brief, enigmatic entry in the new online edition of Disney A-Z: The Official Encyclopedia. It isn’t clear whether the company would have any legitimate grounds for an intellectual copyright claim. Moore was careful to replace all park music, even the appropriately hellish “It’s A Small World After All,” with original compositions, and his film, an obvious work of satire, technically falls under the provisions of fair use (the same ambiguity that allowed Trey Parker and Matt Stone to write an episode of South Park featuring a foul-mouthed Mickey Mouse beating up the Jonas Brothers).
It would be easy to hear about Escape from Tomorrow and label it sight unseen as an anti-corporate hatchet job, a cynical attempt to shock and subvert. Yet the truth is far more complicated. Moore and his merry band of trespassers have a deeply ingrained affection for Disney; they’re just scared to death of what it’s been doing to us all these years. And that struggle between love and loathing infuses every frame of their audacious creation. As Mickey himself would say, “Oh boy!”

In a gaming holiday season that is somewhat overshadowed by the coming Xbox One and the PlayStation 4, Nintendo prepares to release a fall lineup of their own characterized by both innovation and nostalgia. The familiar characters of old, from Sonic to Mario to Zelda, appear in brand new games, but with a modern twist. Aspects such as multiplayer, 3-D, clear graphics and new platforms give these old-school games figuratively, and literally, new dimensions.
Double the fun · The Wii U’s new gamepad allows users to expand on their gaming experience by using two screens. Some games will only use the gamepad’s screen, allowing users to use other Wii functions on the TV. – Photo courtesy of Nintendo of America
While Nintendo might not have a new gaming console coming out this winter, the handheld 2DS will premiere on the market as an alternative to the already popular 3DS. Apart from lacking the no glasses 3-D technology that made the 3DS so revolutionary, the 2DS is a toned-down, simpler portable system with a price tag to match.
Nintendo Senior Product Marketing Specialist J.C. Rodrigo said the company’s approach to mobile gaming is different from competitor Sony’s.
“We wanted to make it cheaper and more accessible,” Rodrigo said. With a suggested retail price of $129.99, the new system is significantly cheaper compared to its 3DS XL counterpart at $199.99. The pared down 2DS will have no hinges with a flat surface and will still be able to play all 3DS games. “It will be sturdier and able to withstand abuse,” Rodrigo said.
The portable DS platform will feature several anticipated game releases this holiday season, most notable of which are Pokémon X, Pokémon Y and The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.
The latest installment in the The Legend of Zelda series comes as what Rodrigo describes as a “spiritual sequel” to the 1991 Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past that first appeared on the Super Nintendo. The new installment uses the same map as its spiritual predecessor as well as some of the same villains.
The similarities, however, stop there. “It has old-school gameplay and new-school rules,” Rodrigo said. Link gets new powers and the conventional understanding of Zelda characters, game flow and story are all challenged.
The old map gets a 3-D face-lift with stunning graphics that justify the 3-D feature that most other games use only as a gimmick.
Other marquee games will feature on Nintendo’s flagship game console, the Wii U. The Wii U, just under a year old, combines the traditional Wii controller with the new GamePad, a larger controller with a screen of its own.
“This hardware gives us a lot of potential,” Rodrigo said. The many different gameplay styles make for an unconventional gaming experience.
Super Mario 3D World is the first ever multiplayer 3-D Mario game from Nintendo. Up to four players can now play in the latest, and perhaps most visually stunning, Mario world yet.
A key component of the newest installment is “cat mode,” a power-up that transforms the Mario characters into cats. This feature exemplifies the childish and playful nature of the Wii system. Admittedly, it certainly isn’t trying to appeal to the same audience that will enjoy Grand Theft Auto V. The fun, nonviolent direction of the software developed for the Wii system is both a hindrance and one of its strengths. Most of the time it means sacrificing complex gaming for oftentimes more basic yet visually rich game experiences.
No game exemplifies this childlike innocence better than the Sonic series. Sonic: Lost World is the latest installment in the expansive Sonic series and the first on the new Wii U system. This new installment features a slower, easier to control Sonic in a boundless stage structure world; there are more options and more paths, and completing a stage is not a linear process.
The impressive visuals immerse gamers in the 3-D world, but this seems to be the only factor that distinguishes it from its very, very long list of predecessors. Sonic: Lost World will be out on Oct. 29 for the Wii U.
The new lineup of games all share that same characteristic of childish simplicity and nostalgia. Yoshi, Charizard, Mario, Sonic and Link are all key characters in Nintendo’s new wave of gaming and all are over 20 years old. The gameplay is somewhat revamped with the new system and sharper graphics, but ultimately some updates are gimmicky and insubstantive — it’s difficult for a developer to make the 53rd game in a series look strikingly different from the 52nd.
Nintendo’s greatest recent innovation is the gaming potential of the Wii U GamePad. The multiscreen multicontroller experience is unlike any other system, and games such as Wii Party U can use this technology to its fullest potential. For example, in the foosball mini-game included with Wii Party U, the larger screen is ignored. Its versatility is a major component of its appeal; gamers can play a game on the GamePad controller and watch Netflix on the TV through the same Wii U system. “We want it to feel different than conventional gaming,” Rodrigo said.
Wii Fit U is another example of the versatility of the system. The new addition to the Wii Fit series includes new technology, online fitness communities and new workouts. Using an additional piece of equipment called the Wii Fit Meter, players can track their movements all day and upload the results into the system. You can track your progress, share it with your online communities and even virtually walk famous trails around the world.
Some of the features of the GamePad and Wii Fit system are quite clever, but the rest seem gimmicky and such is the case for Nintendo’s holiday season lineup as a whole. What it fails to substantially improve and innovate, just seems tired and overused. Those who enjoy Nintendo’s recognizable character roster and see gaming as a family activity, however, will appreciate the familiarity of its holiday lineup.

Playing it safe? That is by far the stupidest thing I ever heard regarding Nintendo….. thats says alot considering how much crazy is out there at places like NeoGAF and IGN.
How is releasing their most successful franchises considered playing it safe? The sales of the console need a boost, you will not get a boost in sales from releasing brand new franchises…. Donkey Kong, Mario, Zelda, is called smart business. Smart businesses leverage their most popular/profitable intellectual property first…
Playing it smart is apparently playing it safe? So what would call releasing a Metroid, F-Zero, and other franchises that completely bombed in their last outings? That would be playing it DUMB.
But lets compare the xBone/PS4’s lineup. Releasing more of the same AAA games we played for the last 7 years with slightly better visuals…. and thats not playing it safe? Sony has more cinematic movies, more shooters. What do they really have that looks even remotely different from their standard fair?

The International Monetary Fund predicted that Ireland will finally begin to emerge from its economic woes and expand by the end of the year, according to the Irish Independent. The Independent went on to state that significant problems remain for the Irish economy, including long-term unemployment, high debt-to-GDP ratios and a lack of credit for the private sector. Ireland and Europe both need austerity to end in order for the region to grow.
Austerity, which is an economic policy used to reduce budget deficits, has been implemented in Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain. The situation is the same in other economically troubled parts of Europe. This was necessary to fall in line with the demands of the IMF and Germany while paying back foreign debt. But fundamentally, the effort to increase taxes to pay down debt is backward, and does more damage to these nations. As Sir Winston Churchill once said, “we contend that for a nation to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle.” Austerity presents exactly this problem to European nations emerging from debt. Markets are cyclical, with natural periods of growth and contraction.
If governments adopted the Keynesian economic policy, then they could attempt to balance the booms and busts and maintain a certain basic level of economic security for the entire population. Having some basic level of growth during periods of economic distress, even when coupled with income tax, allows money to circulate in economic markets and maintain a certain level of prosperity for the people. Instilling austerity measures has none of these benefits; austerity just punishes populations further during harsh economic times.
Another troubling point about austerity is that it cannot handle other general economic distress on the markets. In most situations, debt crises arise during periods of slow economic growth, as that is the only time when the markets have doubts about the ability of borrowing countries to pay back loans. Thus, austerity generally only arises during a period of some economic distress.
As the markets move back to periods of growth following contraction, markets afflicted by austerity will not have the ability to take advantage of that growth. According to economist Megan Greene, Ireland has already begun to experience a situation where stagnation in world markets prevents Irish growth, even amid economic austerity. Greene wrongly states that loosening austerity measures would do nothing to turn Irish fortunes around, because the austerity fundamentally prevents capital from entering the markets, prohibiting new growth.
Then, when further economic contraction occurs, as it is about to as a result of the U.S. debt ceiling debate, according to The New York Times, these countries are ill-equipped to handle the problem. Alternatively, as natural business cycles take their course, troubled countries miss out on periods of economic growth because of austerity and can get hit with the next economic recession, as is occurring now, according to The Economist. Furthermore, austerity requirements placed on indebted countries by groups such as the IMF require regular payments on debt, and those payments are interrupted by economic malaise.
At this point, the Irish are in a worse place economically than when their economic crisis began in 2007 after the collapse of the construction market. In 2006, Irish unemployment was near 4 percent, one of the lowest rates in the world. Now, Irish unemployment is only beginning to fall and stands at 13.3 percent, not far from its 2012 peak of 15.1 percent, according to Trading Economics. In a period when the Dow Jones Industrial Average doubled in value, Irish fortunes were at a standstill. Ireland is finally beginning to emerge from the economic crisis, but the costs are very high, writes professor Stephen Kinsella in the Foreign Affairs Journal. Kinsella goes on to note that the Irish philosophy should be taught around Europe as a lesson in avoiding economic austerity in already poor periods of growth.
Austerity measures are reactionary and damaging. The results from Ireland show that austerity, because it is applied only after a country is in severe debt-based economic crisis, cannot reverse the fortunes of a debt-ridden country while maintaining some engagement to general market trends. Reducing debt to increase investor confidence is a worthy goal, just not at a time of economic panic. Countries would be better off prioritizing growth to pay back loans and worrying about debt during periods of strong economic growth.

What are the Austerity measures and metrics? How much was cut? Did the budget go from $100B to $90B? Did productivity go up or down. 
As you may know from group projects in school sometimes the addition of more people on the job may LOWER effectiveness. 
Presently the USA is staring at a debate it does not want to have – is the economy better with 10% unemployment or 5% unemployment?

Last Thursday, after the shooting death of a woman at Capitol Hill, the debate over the use of firearms deepened in complexity. At least 17 shots were fired by law enforcement agencies, resulting in the death of unarmed 34-year-old Miriam Carey, according to The New York Times.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
Carey, who suffered from schizophrenia, attempted to ram through a White House security barrier, knocked over a uniformed Secret Service agent, hit police cruisers and breached the outer security of Capitol grounds, according to the Washington Post.
The shooting sparked questions over the use of force and the appropriateness of the officers’ actions. Though the officers defend their actions, it is clear that such a tragedy could have been prevented. Carey was speeding between the White House and the U.S. Capitol in a black Infiniti with her one-year-old daughter at the time of her death. The child was unharmed and is currently in protective custody. The shooting is currently being investigated by the D.C. police department’s internal affairs division to determine whether agents broke any laws, according to ABC News.
But ultimately, nonviolent means should have been a priority for officers dealing with Carey, especially since Carey suffered from schizophrenia. Given her mental illness, the actions of the officers are even more unreasonable.
Also, Carey was not just any rogue individual. She was a mother. Special consideration should have been given to the welfare of her child. Using firearms in dealing with an unarmed parent was a short-term solution to maintain security for the Capitol. The long-term consequence is that Carey’s daughter has become an orphan.
Moreover, police officers themselves serve as role models to society as a whole. They must act responsibly when reacting to crises, instead of opting for the easiest way out, which often means unnecessary death.
Had nonviolent means been prioritized, Carey’s story might have had a different ending. Police officers wield a monumental amount of influence. If officers choose to employ peaceful means in handling sensitive cases, it would encourage society as a whole to do the same and help prevent these tragedies from occurring.
Some, such as Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), are calling for mental health reform after this tragedy. But equal attention must be paid to the training officers receive when responding to chaotic scenarios. Officers must learn that responding to violence with more violence is not always the correct answer.
It is simply unacceptable that society has reached a point where episodes such as Carey’s are expected to result in threat elimination with no questions asked. In the end, these cases need to be treated with special consideration.
It is time to break the cycle of brutality that has become expected when law enforcement responds to threats of the mentally ill and cease these preventable tragedies.

CAROLINE,
You are the epitomy of a Monday morning QB. All the facts you state such as…
1) Miriam Carey is a mother 
2) Miriam Carey is mentally ill
3) Miriam Carey is not a rogue individual (BTW – not sure how you are defining this. Is it because she allowed a man to inseminate her and then she gave birth to a baby? If so, there are still plenty of cases in history where women who happened to make babies still engaged in roguish behavior).
…would NOT have been known in the heat of the battle. If a crazed person started to chase you or your loved ones down with their car, are you seriously saying the cops should not do anything until they ascertained a complete personal history of the perp? Or you serious? It seems you must have lived so far in a very sheltered world where life and death decisions do not happen in real time. One can pontificate all day long over their favorite coffee beverage, check out how Oprah weighed in on the situation, and then come up with a laughable opinion several days later.
Crazy people sometimes do crazy things that require they be stopped.  That at times will include different levels of force by authorities.  Mental illness unfortunately can manifest in ways that endangers others, as a young adult the writer lacks real world experience with this matter.  I encourage her to visit Metro  State Hospital or do a ride along with a law enforcment entity that deals with the mentally ill.  I believe  she will discover that mental illness is a far more terrible thing then she has ever imagined.
Caroline, you sound biased.  What do you truly know about how police officers do their jobs?  Before hopping on the anti police bandwagon many college students and their professors ride around on, take the time to do some research.  Don’t take the easy road.  Be unique and energetic in your quest for knowledge.  Go on a ‘ridealong’ with any of the numerous police departments located within a short drive from your school.  Skip the party and do so on a Friday or Saturday night where you will barely have time to use the restroom.  You can ask the officer all the questions you like about police tactics/use of force and from his/her answers and from what you witness, you will gain perspective.  You will understand that there is no bio page of the criminal/person of interest sent to the police car screen a la NCIS Los Angeles.  Police officers know next to nothing or absolutely nothing about the person they are contacting, prior to contacting them.  Some police departments will say you can’t do a ride along unless you are a citizen of that city.  But you have a way around that because you are a student doing research.  I was a police officer in So Cal for over 20 years and I would enjoy rolling out with the occasional college kid.  It will be something you never forget.
shoot to kill period
It is sad that USC is turning left. There is no balance; no critical thinking.
Use of force against “mentally ill” is unwarranted
Which thereof, we are a broad demographic. The only time the vast majority of us come in contact with law enforcement is due to minor infractions, like failing to stop at a stop sign.
So when the mentally ill start a killing spree, we should let them stop on their own?! 
Whether one is mentally ill or not, it is a moral duty to prevent further harm. Re: 2nd Amendment, an armed police force
Yes, Ms. Kamerschen is right. The police should have allowed the lunatic driver who was driving insanely and violently and struck multiple vehicles to run them over. Then, she might have plowed through the city streets until the crush of bodies under her wheels stalled the car. Then the police could have given her soothing therapy.
Caroline, it’s difficult to engage in therapy during a police pursuit.  The cops in DC did what they had to do to end an immediate threat to the safety of the public and government institutions.  The issue of schizophrenia is irrelevant at the time a violent act is taking place.  The cops have no way of knowing her medical history, nor should they be required to speculate in the heat of the moment.
In 1998, Russell Weston, another schizophrenic, entered the Capitol and killed two police officers before he was wounded by a dying detective and taken into custody.  By your logic, the police should have “focused on non-violent means” due to his mental illness.  Perhaps Detective Gibson should have said something soothing with his last breath instead of shooting the man, eh?
A final thought – has it not occurred to you that the actions of the police probably saved the life of that child in Carey’s car?
