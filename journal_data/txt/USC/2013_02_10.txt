The International Business Machines Watson Case Competition, which challenged students to think outside the box with Watson technologies, was held this weekend with more than 100 student participants, faculty judges and IBM executives in attendance.
Judgment · Jayashree Subrahmonia, vice president of engineering and delivery for Watson Solutions, and Nick Orrick, software engineer for Watson Solutions, presented and judged at the weekend competition.
 
The competition, which was held on the West Coast for the first time, joined multiple schools within USC including the Marshall School of Business, Viterbi School of Engineering, Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and Leventhal School of Accounting. In 2012, the competition was held at Cornell University, and in 2011 it was at the University of Rochester.
The competition was created as a result of an invention the company created in 2011. IBM invented Watson, a supercomputer, because it wanted to create a computer that could be competitive on the television game show, Jeopardy! Watson can compile, for instance, huge amounts of information from  all corners of the Internet to answer complicated questions, such as the ones found on the game show.
The computer itself relies on cognitive computing, similar to the human brain. With these findings, IBM created a ninth division to their company, Watson Solutions, and implemented this technology in the fields of health care, finance and call centers.
Twenty-five interdisciplinary teams, comprising four people each, participated on Friday. Two of the team members of each team were required to be Marshall and Viterbi students. Teams then gave a five-minute pitch to the panel of USC professors, IBM representatives and professionals. The judges then selected five of those teams to give a 20-minute presentation that included a 15-minute question-and-answer session with IBM officials.
Students were given 48 hours to find a way to put the IBM Watson technology to work in practical matters. They had to determine  possible benefits to the market and the target audience for these services.
The final presentations were given Sunday afternoon.
Mingbo Gong, a junior majoring in accounting and business administration, had the idea to host the competition at USC. He interned with IBM and reached out to the company via LinkedIn about hosting the competition at USC. Gong said engineering and business effectively work together.
“There are other options and business is not just focused on finances,” Gong said. “There are so many ways to implement business engineering, you can work with fashion or architecture.”
Gong was also impressed by how quick the response was from IBM. The company responded within three days to begin setting up the competition at USC.
“I feel that we started from nothing — Ming’s LinkedIn message — to everything we have today. It’s very inspiring,” said Anna Lin, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Some students said combining the two disciplines will enhance the competition.
“Business and engineering should work together,” said Eric Pakravan, a student majoring in business administration.
The event was co-sponsored by Marshall Business Student Government, National Organization of Business and Engineering, Business Technology Networking Group and the Association for Computing Machinery.

President C. L. Max Nikias is one of the 29 donors to contribute to a $1-million reward for information leading to the capture of suspect-at-large Christopher Jordan Dorner, according to Los Angeles Police Department.
Dorner was named a suspect Wednesday in the murders of Dept. of Public Safety officer Keith Lawrence, 27, and his fiancee Monica Quan, 28. The two were found dead late Sunday night in Lawrence’s car in the parking garage of their Irvine apartment building. An autopsy on the victims determined that they died of multiple gunshot wounds.
Dorner is also a suspect in the murder of a Riverside police officer.
Other donors to the reward include police officer associations, law enforcement departments across Southern California, the Dodgers and Anschutz Entertainment Group, along with six anonymous donors.
The $1 million was raised within 24 hours, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck said, through phone calls to the department.
The manhunt for Dorner began last week and has spanned several Southern California areas, including Riverside, Corona, Big Bear, Point Loma and San Diego.
Police uncovered a manifesto written by Dorner, which mentioned Monica Quan’s father, Randy Quan, a retired LAPD officer, along with other LAPD officials. Dorner was fired from the deparment in 2009.
The LAPD also said it will reevaluate Dorner’s firing.
Easy to spend others money!
Mr. President.  I am so proud of you and being a Trojan.  I would like to share my input on the gun laws being considered by Mr. Obama.  There are enough laws now that the criminal mind does not consider it a problem.  As long as they have access to making money through drug distribution, prostitution, etc… they will always find people that are willing to make money selling arms to the criminal.  The criminal will always have more money than the restrictions placed upon them.
We have digressed in our moral standings as individual.  There is no fear of the law, police or even life itself.  We see it in our schools. businesses, and our government (local and national).  There is no accountability anymore.  It is always someone else that caused the problem.  We want to sue because we are offended.  Children used to behave in this manner.  Now it is the norm for adults; so do our children learn.
May God bless America.  Thank you again Mr. President C. L. Max Nikias.

The School of Cinematic Arts will be partnering with the comedy website Funny or Die to offer a workshop for students interested in writing comedy sketches.
Project partners · Funny or Die created webisodes with the School of Cinematic Arts. The webisodes were filmed on Sunday. — Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Jack Epps Jr., SCA’s chair of the Writing for Screen and Television Division, said the partnership was originally formed when Funny or Die approached the school with the intent of creating a new program on their website.
“Funny or Die contacted us and they wanted to start a program called Funny or Die U, and they wanted to come to us first, seeing as we are the premier film school,” Epps said. “We have, at the same time, Comedy@SCA — a comedy program which is evolving — so [the partnership] made perfect sense.”
Epps said the students who will be participating in a workshop will gain insight into the entire process of how a webisode is written and produced. This webisode was filmed on Sunday.
“The workshop covers the basic methodology for Funny or Die, like how their writers approach their sketches, how they work as a collaborative team [and] how they shoot their webisodes,” Epps said. “It’s great because Funny or Die has a unique look with high production value, but [is] still really funny.”
Epps said the approximately 80 students partaking in the workshop benefit from learning from the people behind the Funny or Die website. It will allow students to work with professional writers and provide an opportunity to have their work featured on Funny or Die.
“The writers come down and supervise the students and their webisodes and [teach them] the Funny or Die method,” Epps said. “It also gives the students an opportunity to make a webisode, [because] the strongest webisode will be put up on the front page of Funny or Die.”
Funny or Die fans, such as Jonathan Foor, a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television, said they would be participating in the workshop because they enjoy the content on the site.
“I love [Funny or Die’s] content and getting a chance to participate in this contest is an incredible opportunity that only USC could provide,” Foor said.
Kevin May, a sophomore majoring in business administration with an emphasis in cinematic arts, said the partnership between SCA and Funny or Die would be valuable for both the students involved and the website.
“Any opportunity where companies established in the entertainment industry are giving USC students a chance to experiment with their content is beneficial for all parties involved,” May said. “It’s critical for students to have some experience with their passions before trying to get a job.”
Genuinely when someone doesn’t be aware of after that its up to other people that they will assist, so here it happens.

MATT ARKFELD & ALEX CASCANTE
Matthew Arkfeld and Alex Cascante are approaching the 2013 Undergraduate Student Government election with reform in mind, focusing their platform on internal USG operations.
Arkfeld, a junior majoring in East Asian area studies, currently serves as senate speaker pro tempore. Cascante, a junior majoring in business administration, serves as a Greek senator.
“Our main objective is to reconsider the traditional structure of USG and make changes that better serve the student body,” Arkfeld said.
Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Since beginning his career at USC, two years ago as a spring admit, Arkfeld has joined several organizations, such as Phi Delta Theta and Spirit Leaders.
“Throughout every semester at USC I’ve taken a leap of faith,” Arkfeld said. “I joined a new organization and met a new group of people. I’ve really been able to dive into the Greek community but not let it define me.”
Cascante is in the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity, as well as the Accounting Society, and works with Hillel and other Jewish organizations on campus.
Though this is their first year in USG, Arkfeld has written five resolutions –— the most resolutions for a senator this term — and both he and Cascante have worked on long-term advocacy projects.
With their slogan “Think Different,” the two are most passionate about reforming USG’s budget. They want to use the funds that normally support USG internally and redistribute them to fund student organizations.
“Matt and I are running because we see a problem and we want to fix it,” Cascante said. “It’s our responsibility, as student government, to fix the USG budget so we can support more student organizations and promote positive change on campus.”
Both have vowed to cut the presidential and vice presidential salaries. They also want USG to reach out to students more effectively.
“Nobody knows what student government does, but what [students] should know is that [students] give $57 a semester to [USG],” Cascante said. “It’s really informing them about what USG can actually do and what we can do for them.”
Though Arkfeld and Cascante want to reform the advocacy side, they do not want to change Program Board, an organization under the preview of USG that plans events. In addition, Arkfeld said reviewing past candidates’ platforms demonstrates the need for change.
“We saw one re-occuring thing: The same candidates were recycling old platform points and nothing was getting done,” Arkfeld said. “We’ve really gone out to focus on what we actually control: the budget.”
Arkfeld said he looks forward to making positive changes for future Trojans.
“I want to take this opportunity, grab it full swing and really give 500 percent,” Arkfeld said. “I care about making USC a better place for the next generation of students after myself.”
 
USG Elections: Matt and Alex by Daily Trojan
 
 
CHRISTIAN KURTH & RYAN PARK
 Christian Kurth and Ryan Park see their ticket as a continuation of Undergraduate Student Government’s current policies, and several of their platform points are policies that they began lobbying for in their current positions.
Kurth, a junior majoring in accounting, and Park, a junior majoring in business administration, believe what sets them apart from their opponents is experience.“I’ve been involved in USG since my freshman year, so I’ve gotten three years of USG experience, which is more than the other ticket combined,” said Kurth, who is currently USG director of university affairs.Kurth said his involvement in advocacy gives him an advantage in accomplishing goals.
Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
“The president’s job is kind of like the head of the advocacy branch, which I’ve been involved with for three years,” Kurth said. “The advocacy branch’s essential job is to meet with administrators, cement those relationships and actually work on getting projects done and executing change — that’s what I’ve been doing.”
Their platform contains 21 different points, which range from bringing Jamba Juice back to campus to increasing the acceptance of discretionary dollars at off-campus locations.
“I love my USC mobile app [idea],” said Park of his favorite platform point. “When it happens, it’s going to be the most helpful [accomplishment], in my opinion, because it will be a centralized location for students to find out what’s going on on-campus.”
The two have known each other since their freshman years, when they met as tour guides. Kurth and Park said they can achieve ambitious goals because of their chemistry.
“In terms of compatibility, if this was an eHarmony situation, I think we’d be great,” Kurth said. “I’m more of a serious figure, and as a president, I think that’s what you need. He’s kind of more the goofball between us.”
Both are involved outside of USG. Kurth is a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, the Latino Alumni Association and the Trojan Investing Society. Park is part of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
Despite the fact that both Kurth and Park are in USG, belong to fraternities and serve as tour guides, neither sees their similarities in experience as a concern.
“We have a lot of things in common but, to be completely honest, we have had a lot of different experiences in each of those things,” Park said.
Kurth added that being Greek doesn’t define either of them because they are involved with other organizations.
With voting beginning on Tuesday, Kurth and Park are campaigning hard for students’ votes. The two believe that they should win because of their commitment to the election.
“I honestly believe that we have put in exponentially more hours and exponentially more time and passion into this campaign than the other ticket,” Park said.

The USC women’s basketball team traveled up the coast to Washington over the weekend, hoping to sweep both Washington State and Washington this season. Ultimately, the Women of Troy came up short in both contests, losing a tight game to the Cougars 57-54 on Friday and falling 61-58 to the Huskies on Sunday.
Road weary · Sophomore guard Ariya Crook scored 15 points in the team’s 61-58 loss to the Washington Huskies on Sunday in Seattle. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
Against Washington (17-6, 9-3 Pac-12), junior forward Cassie Harberts bounced back from her first single-digit scoring game of the season, leading the Women of Troy (8-15, 5-7 Pac-12) with 16 points and eight rebounds. Sophomore guard Ariya Crook added 15 points, six rebounds and six assists, while junior forward Desiree Bradley scored 11 points.
Point guard Jazmine Davis led Washington with 24 points, while forward Talia Walton added 13.
The Huskies jumped out to an 11-4 lead early against USC, but the Women of Troy scored eight straight points to take the lead behind two 3-pointers from Crook and a jumper by sophomore guard Kiki Alofaituli. The Huskies would retake the lead on a pair of free throws from Davis and hold it throughout the course of the half.
Washington led 38-28 at the half on 39 percent shooting. Harberts scored 10 points and grabbed six rebounds in the first half, while Crook added 10 points for the Women of Troy.
Davis scored 13 of the Huskies’ first 23 points to lead the charge but was held scoreless throughout the remainder of the half. Walton added eight points and four rebounds for Washington.
The Women of Troy came back strong to start the second half, going on a 14-7 run to cut the Huskies’ lead to three. The Huskies would maintain their advantage until a 3-pointer from Bradley gave the Women of Troy a 54-53 lead with 5:50 left. The game went back and forth until a jumper from Davis gave the Huskies the lead for good. USC would finish with 39 percent shooting compared to Washington’s 36 percent, and both teams were even with 33 rebounds apiece.
“We come out in the second half, and they play harder and smarter than us,” Harberts said. “We haven’t been down by 10 at the half that often, so we knew we had to step it up.”
USC was in control for the majority of the game against Washington State (9-14, 5-6 Pac-12), leading by as many as 10 points in the first half, but once again failed to play two halves of complete basketball. The Cougars closed the gap in the second half, took a late a late lead and, ultimately, held off the Women of Troy.
A good sign for USC was the return of senior forward Christina Marinacci, who had a game-high 17 points, shooting a perfect three-for-three from 3-point range. Crook would add 15 points.
The Cougars had a much more balanced scoring attack with 10 different players scoring in the game, led by 11 and 10 points from guards Dawnyelle Awa and Lia Galdeira, respectively. The team heated up in the second half, shooting 52 percent after shooting only 32 percent in the first half. In contrast, USC cooled down, shooting a dismal 27 percent in the second half to finish at 32 percent for the game.
The Women of Troy held a 28-23 advantage at halftime, but the Cougars would eventually tie the game at 31-31 at the 17-minute mark and take their first lead of the game, 41-39, breaking the fifth tie of the game. The two teams were tied again at 45 with 8:30 to go before the Cougars went off for a 8-0 run to take the lead, which they would never give back.
USC returns to the Galen Center for a tough three-game homestand as it looks to end a four-game losing streak. The Women of Troy will face No. 4 Stanford (22-2, 11-1 Pac-12) on Friday, Feb. 15 at 8 p.m. and No. 6 California (21-2, 10-1 Pac-12) on Sunday, Feb. 17 at 2 p.m.  The Women of Troy follow that up against No. 17 UCLA (19-4, 10-2 Pac-12) on Tuesday, Feb. 19 at 8 p.m.

USC dispatched two more ranked opponents this weekend to continue their undefeated start to the season. The weather was unusually cold and windy, but that didn’t stop the No. 2 Trojans from improving to 9-0 on the season by taking down the No. 13 California Bears and the No. 19 Stanford Cardinal.
Going strong · USC freshman Max de Vroome won his singles match against Cal’s Mads Engsted on Friday 6-3, 6-3 to help USC secure the win. — Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
The Trojans opened up against the Bears with some bizarre action in doubles. Playing in the No. 1 spot, junior Ray Sarmiento and sophomore Yannick Hanfmann were tied 2-2 (40-30) with Cal’s Riki McLachlan and Ben McLachlan when Riki McLachlan suffered a brutal knee injury that stopped play on all three courts. Almost immediately after the injury occurred, it began to rain. The match was awarded to Sarmiento and Hanfmann, and doubles play continued after Riki McLachlan was carried off the court and the rain stopped.
To secure the doubles point, sophomore Eric Johnson and junior Emilio Gomez, playing at No. 3, defeated Cal’s Christoffer Konigsfeldt and Gregory Bayane, 8-2. The No. 2 match between sophomore Roberto Quiroz and freshman Max de Vroome and Cal’s Campbell Johnson and Mads Engsted was abandoned at 5-5 (15-40).
The Trojans won all six singles sets to help USC sweep Cal by a total score of 7-0. Hanfmann was first to finish, knocking out Bayane 6-3, 6-1. Next, Johnson defeated Engsted 6-3, 6-3, and Quiroz clinched a USC victory with a 6-3, 6-1 win over Johnson. De Vroome was able to dispatch Cal’s Chase Melton, 6-1, 7-5.
Sarmiento, playing at No. 1, was bothered by the cold weather and the wind but eventually defeated McLachlan, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
“It wasn’t my best tennis,” Sarmiento said. “But I had to stay strong, find my opportunities and take advantage of them.”
Gomez, who played in the No. 2 singles slot, closed out the match by defeating his opponent, Konigsfeldt, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5).
“My mentality was…just to stay aggressive,” Gomez said. “Even if I miss, just keep going, keep going.”
The Trojans kept their momentum heading into Saturday’s matchup against Stanford. The Cardinal were swept 7-0 at UCLA the day before and came to USC hungry for a victory, but the Trojans proved to be too much to handle.
Once again, USC earned the doubles point at the beginning of the day. The No. 2 pair, Quiroz and de Vroome, made quick work of Stanford’s Jamin Ball and Trey Strobel, winning 8-0. Sarmiento and Hanfmann defeated Stanford’s Matt Kandath and John Morrissey 8-2 to clinch the doubles point for USC. The No. 3 matchup between Johnson and Gomez and Stanford’s Maciek Romanowicz and Robert Stineman was abandoned with Johnson and Gomez trailing 2-5.
The Trojans won all but one singles match to secure USC a 6-1 overall win against Stanford. Hanfmann continued his impressive weekend by defeating Stanford’s Kandath, 6-1, 6-1. Sarmiento sat out due to an ongoing abdominal injury, so Gomez moved up to the No. 1 spot and defeated Stanford’s Morrissey 6-2, 6-1. Johnson routed Stanford’s Strobel 6-1, 6-0. For the second time in as many days, Quiroz clinched a USC victory with his 6-3, 6-2 win over Romanowicz.
After USC had already clinched the victory, the Trojans faced their two most difficult matches of the day. Playing at the No. 4 spot, de Vroome lost to Stanford’s Nolan Paige 4-6, 7-5, 1-0 (8-10). Paige defeated de Vroome earlier this season at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup, but since the start of ITA play, de Vroome had yet to drop a set, let alone a match.
To finish off the Trojans’ successful weekend, senior Michael Grant defeated Stanford’s Stineman, 3-6, 7-6 (10-8), 1-0 (10-7). Grant was put into the lineup at the last minute and stepped up to fill the No. 6 position when Sarmiento was forced to sit out.
USC head coach Peter Smith was proud of the way the team played through some adversity this weekend against two teams they will face again during Pac-12 play.
“The conditions were tough,” Smith said. “But we were tougher.”

An offseason of scapegoating, finger-pointing and holding everyone besides USC head coach Lane Kiffin accountable continued last Friday. USC fired running backs coach Kennedy Polamalu in a stunning move apparently one month in the making. For those keeping score at home, USC has now nudged out four assistant coaches this offseason.
In response to the head-scratching news, redshirt freshman fullback Soma Vainuku posted on his Twitter account, “Not only did we lose the best coach, we lost the only Trojan who was on staff. Sad day.”
Freshman running back Ty Isaac offered a more succinct reaction via Twitter: “Disappointed.” To Kiffin’s credit, however, it appears the Under Armour All-American was kept abreast of the possible move before national signing day, even though Polamalu still visited him days before the deadline to complete the recruiting pitch.
Of all the coaches on staff, perhaps the only ones I might have guessed enjoyed more job security than Polamalu are defensive line coach Ed Orgeron and wide receivers coach Tee Martin — both ace recruiters whose position groups also exceeded expectations in 2012.
Unfortunately for Polamalu, the USC rushing attack rarely gained traction in most games, mostly because of play calling. By the end of the season, USC ran the ball on 46 percent of its plays — a fairly balanced offensive approach, to be sure. Kiffin did not become overly pass-happy, as many have charged. But the run plays were rarely imaginative and failed to utilize his running backs’ strengths.
Many of senior running back Curtis McNeal’s big plays in 2011 came on pitches where he could use his shiftiness to motor outside the tackles and down the sidelines. So why did Kiffin often call for him to run between the tackles like a conventional workhorse running back 40 pounds heavier? Of course, former left tackle Matt Kalil helped spring McNeal for several of those runs in 2011, but Kiffin rarely even gave McNeal a chance to succeed before relegating him to the bench.
Regardless of the suspect play calling, there is no question that the underperformance of USC’s veteran offensive line also betrayed the running game. Simply put, USC recently hasn’t produced the road-graders along the offensive line that can compare to the ones at, say, Stanford — a team that has transformed from an anemic, outgunned offense to one of the nation’s most punishing frontlines.
Moreover, in his three years, Polamalu never inherited a bona fide star running back he could coach into a force.
Among the cast of McNeal, Marc Tyler, Allen Bradford, redshirt sophomore D.J. Morgan and even junior Silas Redd, Polamalu never coached a player at USC with the combination of speed, vision and tenacity that could take over a game. All four of his running backs this past season were injury-prone and unable to shoulder 20-plus carries per game consistently.
Now, after bringing in two blue-chip, national running back recruits, Polamalu must leave without the opportunity to coach the young stars from the ground up.
Speaking of McNeal, Polamalu’s tough love and mentorship helped bring the 2011 savior back from the brink of losing his scholarship when the diminutive running back failed to qualify academically for the 2010 season. The die-hard Trojan and former USC fullback was a relatable figure for the running backs group, whose words of experience packed an extra punch.
On an offensive staff led by a coach who buries his head in a laminated play sheet and sports an inscrutable expression, Polamalu offered a much-needed spark of energy.
Polamalu is the one who berated Redd in his first USC practice for running in the wrong direction on one play, even though the former Penn State star had only just picked up a playbook days before. He held everyone accountable and pushed them to achieve their potential.
Emphasizing accountability, attention to detail and hard work will be the avenue through which USC can return to former glories. Unfortunately, the Trojans just gave up a coach with the ability to extract that kind of effort from his players.

An offseason with no shortage of tough news for the USC football team continued on Friday as USCFootball.com reported that offensive coordinator and running backs coach Kennedy Polamalu will not be returning for the Trojans’ 2013 campaign.
Change of direction · Coach Kennedy Polamalu (above) was fired after three years of serving on head coach Lane Kiffin’s staff. — Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
“As we continue to evaluate all facets of our program, including the organization of our staff, we made the decision to go in a different direction at this coaching position,” USC head coach Lane Kiffin said in a statement Sunday. “Kennedy Polamalu is a good coach, a good person and a good Trojan. We wish him and his family the best.”
Polamalu played fullback for USC from 1982 to 1985 and served as the team’s running backs and special teams coach from 2000 to 2003. After leaving in 2004 to coach in the NFL, Polamalu returned when USC named Lane Kiffin its head coach.
Though Kiffin has been the primary offensive play caller for the Trojans during his tenure, Polamalu played a large role in Curtis McNeal’s development as well as the recent recruitment of four-star running back Ty Isaac, who signed with the Trojans last Wednesday. USC’s running back tandem of McNeal and junior Silas Redd combined for 1606 yards and 11 touchdowns last season.
Polamalu is the fourth coach to leave the Trojans following their disappointing 2012 season and joins former assistant head coach and de-facto defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin, secondary coach Marvin Sanders and linebackers coach Scottie Hazelton.
Current USC players took to social media to express their feelings about the decision.
“Not only did we lose the best coach, we lost the only Trojan who was on staff. Really sad day,” redshirt freshman fullback Soma Vainuku tweeted Friday.
It is unclear whether Polamalu’s eventual replacement will assume play-calling duties or if Kiffin will retain them.
That’s when you know your’re dealing with an incompetent leader; when he starts firing the competent junior executives around him.
Fight On!

Looking through the crowd, one could tell this was more than just a game.  University president C. L. Max Nikias was there. Athletic director Pat Haden was there. Even USC head football coach Lane Kiffin was there, albeit sitting alone on the opposite side of the Coliseum. But, more importantly, 2,887 other fans were also in attendance on a brisk Saturday afternoon to watch the first-ever NCAA match for USC’s women’s lacrosse, the school’s newest varsity sport.
Breaking ground · Freshman midfielder Amanda Johansen scored two goals on Saturday, including the first ever for USC’s newest program. The Women of Troy fell in their opening match by a final score of 18-5. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
The Trojans fell 18-5 to the No. 1 Northwestern Wildcats, the reigning champions and winners of seven of the last eight NCAA titles, but the excitement of finally making their program debut outweighed the sting of the loss.
“It was just an awesome feeling,” said freshman midfielder Amanda Johansen, who scored the first goal in program history 12 minutes into the first of two 30-minutes halves. “We’ve been working so hard for this, and to have [everyone] just cheering at the same time felt so awesome.”
The matchup was a reunion of sorts for USC head coach Lindsey Munday and offensive coordinator Hillary Bowen, who both starred at Northwestern under Wildcats head coaching legend Kelli Amonte Hiller.
Some were perplexed as to why  USC scheduled to play against the best squad in the nation for their program debut, but Munday is taking a “watch and learn” approach.
“It shows [USC’s players] what the top of women’s lacrosse is right now, and I think that’s a great thing that’s going to prepare us for our conference,” Munday said. “It’s going to help us because you can’t get away with anything.”
On the Coliseum field, the Women of Troy were outmatched from the start. The Wildcats jumped to a quick 4-0 lead, then a 9-1 advantage by dominating face-offs and outshooting USC 47-9 for the game.
USC’s flashiest goal was its second, as Johansen found herself behind the goal before lobbing the ball to freshman midfielder Paige Bonomi to reduce the deficit to 9-2.
“I tried taking a step back and seeing how the whole field would look and, right when I took a step back, I saw somebody wide open in the middle,” Johansen said. “I just hit Paige [Bonomi], and I know she can finish everything.”
The addition of a women’s lacrosse program at USC was one of Nikias’ first initiatives after being inaugurated in August 2010. Munday was hired away from her assistant position at Northwestern in January 2011, and wasted no time getting to work, with her and her coaching staff recruiting up and down the East Coast for players interested in being part of a program different from the traditional eastern powerhouses.  Eleven of the team’s 17 recruits in the class of 2012 hail from the lacrosse hotbeds of New York or New Jersey.
“We can never replicate this,” Munday said. “These 26 players will go down in history.”
The most refreshing part of Munday and her young squad is their unconcealed championship aspirations.
“It’s something that is there for us, and we are not scared to go out there and say it,” Munday said about winning a national title. “We know that there’s a lot of work to be done and that there’s a long journey to get there, but that is our goal. We have to put it out there.”
The Trojans might not be championship contenders this year or the next, but with 17 of the team’s 26 players being freshmen, most of this team will play four years together and carry the program along with them.
“We walk around on campus and have people cheering for us,” Johansen said. “It’s really nice bringing over the whole sport with this team and showing people in California, who’ve never seen it, how lacrosse really is.”
What a monumental and magnificent occasion is this on a Saturday afternoon: the debut of USC women’s lacrosse in an historic stadium against a renowned opponent. Bravo to the cardinal and gold athletes who will build an edifice of accomplishment

Most of the television-viewing population has heard of Modern Family. It’s hard to turn through a magazine without seeing one of its stars, Sofia Vergara, grace an advertisement with her huge smile, flawless curves and bold confidence. The show itself has won multiple awards and this year is no exception to that — Vergara and fellow co-star Eric Stonestreet were nominated for best supporting actor and actress at the Golden Globes.
Still, though Modern Family might have given family sitcoms the push they needed, the series has been hit-or-miss lately. There will be a great episode, such as the one where Claire and Phil accidentally find themselves in a nudist gathering at natural springs. Then there will also be a dud episode where nothing too funny seems to happen.
For those looking for fresher and funnier shows about unusual family dynamics on television, one only needs to look as far as the two shows that bookend Modern Family on ABC — The Middle and Suburgatory.
The Middle focuses on the Heck family, as they go on through daily life, struggling to make ends meet. Unlike most family sitcoms, The Middle takes place in Middle America and centers on a middle-class family of five, struggling financially in a poor economy.
Unlike Modern Family, where characters live in comfortable households and have ideal jobs, The Middle deals with everyday life, job loss and making ends meet. It’s kind of nice to watch a show where the kids do not just receive everything they want but rather have to be patient and wait for gifts. Society has gotten to the point where it’s almost expected that kids will get cell phones (most likely smartphones) at the age of 10, but The Middle shows a family that works for what it needs and fights for what it desires.
Compare it to Girls, where even though the characters are depicted as broke, they still manage to live a relatively comfortable lifestyle in perhaps the most expensive city in the world, New York City. When it comes to The Middle, the writers keep the character’s finances in mind when creating storylines.
True to the Hecks’ lower-middle-class roots, their house is falling apart and they barely have enough money to fix their ancient appliances. In one episode, Brick, who is an avid reader, desires an iPad so he can download books. Rather than just getting him the iPad, the parents must get creative, eventually purchasing a discounted iPad that survived a fire on eBay.
What also makes makes The Middle so watchable, in addition to its humble roots, is its quirkiness. The kids are weird and have one-of-a-kind personalities. Brick, for example, is a socially awkward elementary student who enjoys reading more than playing. He repeats things people say in a deep whisper under his breath. He is strange, no doubt, but there is a certain charm to him — that within a crazy family of five, he can still find peace through the simple joys in life.
Brick’s sister Sue has an equally unique and compelling storyline. Sue is new to high school and is eager to try everything — every club, every position and every job. Even though she tries out for everything, however, she gets no positions and that is what makes her such a breath of fresh air on television. Her character is realistic. She’s not drop-dead gorgeous or incredibly intellectual. She’s optimistic and tries not to let anything get her down. I cannot help but root for this socially inept and braces-baring, but eager and happy, teenage girl.
Another show to keep an eye out for, right after Modern Family is Suburgatory. The premise is that a red-haired, sarcastic daughter, Tessa, and her dad, the rugged George Altman, move from New York to the suburbs, a la Lindsay Lohan in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen.
Thrown into a situation far from their comfort zone, the two urbanites must adjust to life in a crazy, suburban town where everyone is outrageously superficial.
Suburgatory is not like most shows where a ridiculous situation arises. In a show such as Gossip Girl, writers imagine a world where young high schoolers go to fancy clubs, drink champagne and wear posh couture. In Suburgatory however, the writers are fully aware of the craziness of their premise and only write in those siutations to intentionally poke fun at suburban life.
Moreover, the idea that Tessa and her dad truly and openly do not belong to this Stepford Wife-like town is relatively refreshing. And beyond all the flamboyant pink clothes and platinum blonde hair, at the end of each episode there are relatable life lessons about family, friendship and happiness.
Though the characters and scenarios are definitely hyperbolic, The Middle and Suburgatory are fantastic shows to watch during the week because they are a great vacation from real life. You can spend 24 minutes in a freaky, perfect, plastic-seeming suburban town that makes fun of itself as much as the audience makes fun of it. Or you can hang out with Sue in The Middle and see some characters who show that it’s OK to struggle and fail sometimes, as long as you keep trying.

A string of musical hits and dances brings flair and humor to Randall Gray’s play, Doctor, Doctor!, currently running at the recently opened theater Stages of Gray. Though the play is advertised as a work about health care reform, the story is anything but what the stuffy sounding subject connotes. The show’s easy-breezy atmosphere, strong cast performances, unforgettable characters and heartfelt story make for a theatrical experience that shouldn’t be missed.
Love doctor · In Doctor, Doctor! Christine Carter (left), Rich Lee and Savajane Williams star as doctors and secretaries who fall for each other. – Courtesy of Philip Sokoloff
On the surface, the script seems tame: In hopes of delivering health care more efficiently, five health specialists — psychiatrist Jeffrey Kruger, surgeon Amar Dhari, ob-gyn John Bob Martin, general practitioner/sports specialist/chiropractor Trevor Easton and dentist Damien Cook — decide to move their businesses under one roof. To help them, four secretaries and a nurse join their practice. By the time one throws in a pair of patients — one paranoid pregnant woman and man-child Greg Tower — words can hardly capture the shenanigans that ensue in Doctor, Doctor!
The humor of office politics and the flower of romance drive the script. What will it take for the secretaries, now working under one roof, to coexist together without breaking out into catfights? Can the show’s several romances blossom in a hotbed of dreaded disease and business? How will Cook reconcile with Kruger after he finds out that Kruger’s father was a prison guard at Auschwitz, the very place his grandfather died? The characters’ obstacles are not always easy or simple, but the light and breezy way the stories unfold allow for character growth, great drama and one big family to emerge out of a tangled plot.
A few turns and denouements might seem too cheesy at times and too good to be true for the hard-core analyst’s taste, so going with the flow and just riding the stories as they come — nonsensical as they can seem — might be for the best. Yes, the romances and the relationship politics might resolve themselves into bows that are tied too nicely, but, hey, it’s meant to be a feel-good comedy.
Viewers who do not overthink the plot, conversely, will step into a world where everything seems more cartoonish and larger than life.  The script thrives from taking a small step away from reality. That is all it takes for a zany world full of silly characters to arise, and the more mundane the setting — a doctor’s office, complete with files and receptionist desks — the better.
Each actor brings talent and life to the stage, from the costumes worn to every last mannerism — whether it is Kimberly, a pink-loving former cheerleader making pouty faces at her little stuffed poodle or the gum that Dawn, an airhead blonde, gnashes on. To cap it all off a crazy dentist, Dr. Cook stalks around with a buzzing dental drill, which is the love of his life.
Across the board, the acting, singing and dancing are fluid and natural. A range of songs — “You Are So Beautiful,” “I Will Survive,” “Celebration,” “Bad Case of Lovin’ You”— become the score in moments when love rises through the air or the times when Lydia finally tears up while letting go of the past.
Though it is an admirable feat that they can make such a small place — the stage is no bigger than the front of a classroom — come to life, it is even more a testament to the talent on stage that they can transform such an ordinary setting into something straight out of a cartoon. The buttercup walls and cream-colored office doors feel like a well-worn home by the end of the play.
Aside from the talent and well-written score, however, one other thing that puts Doctor, Doctor! into its own class: intimacy. The play achieves a closeness with the audience, a sense of camaraderie and hearty humor that every live performance should bring to the table. With the audience in the first row nearly nose-to-nose with the performers, Stages of Gray really does live up to its reputation as the most intimate theater venue in Los Angeles County. Many a time, audience members find themselves pulled onto stage, going through the silly cheerleading drills of Kimberly or singled out as the next victim of Dr. Cook’s crazed dental sessions with his beloved drill.
With the third row less than five feet away from the performers, the close vicinity might alarm at first, but the sense of private viewing and of a certain involvement with the drama that unfolds is priceless. This was proven by the laughs that exploded through the crowd and the spirited clapping during the upbeat musical scores, along with the standing ovation at the close.
From now until March 24, a number of performances remain of Doctor, Doctor! Though the play might be light-hearted, it is also full of heart, and surely with its humorous antics and breezy storyline,  it’s medicine for the soul.

Argo continued its steamroll through the awards season at the USC Scripter Awards on Saturday evening amid a ceremony dedicated to honoring the value of books and libraries in the film industry.
And the winner is · Journalist Joshuah Bearman (right) who wrote the magazine article that served as a basis for Argo, accepted the Scripter Award for the film. Other nominees included Stephen Chobsky of The Perks of Being a Wallflower as well as the writers of Life of Pi and Silver Linings PlayBook. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Joshuah Bearman, a journalist whose 2007 Wired article served as inspiration for the film, was on hand to accept the award. He made a point of praising the ceremony itself, unique in that it honors both authors and screenwriters with one award.
“As a journalist, I’m open to the idea,” he said. He went on to describe film adaptation as an “unsung process.” The award was presented at the end of an event dedicated to honoring that process.
This was the 25th ceremony  — the award was established in 1988 by the Friends of the USC Libraries with the goal of honoring both sides of the film adaptation process — the source material as well as the screenplay.
Dean of Libraries Catherine Quinlan acted as the host for the evening.
“You like Scripter — you really, really like Scripter,” she said, referencing a speech actress Sally Field once gave at the Academy Awards. Riffing off Field’s quote was just one of her comic lines. She also spent quite a bit of time reminiscing about her cello named Fred, with which she performed on stage at the Scripter Awards last year.
The storied tradition of the award seems to amply prove Quinlan’s remark — the attendees of the ceremony truly enjoy the event, and they return year after year. At one point, Quinlan recognized several people in the audience who had been in attendance at all 25 Scripter ceremonies.
This brand of loyalty and devotion seems atypical for lesser-known annual awards like this one, especially in an industry that is criticized frequently for its obsession with glitz and glamour. USC Trustee Ronald Sugar spoke about the discrepancy between Scripter and other similar ceremonies: “When I come to this, people don’t ask, ‘What are you wearing?’ They ask, ‘What have you read?’”
Appropriately, the ceremony is held each year in the main hall of Doheny Library, which is transformed in breathtaking fashion into what Scripter co-founder Glenn Sonnenberg described as “Hogwarts on steroids.”
The emphasis throughout the evening was on the value of libraries and the monumental influence they’ve had on countless great screenwriters. In an era when  print is rapidly going out of fashion, this award serves to remind film students that computers are poor substitutes for the transporting magic of a library.
The first award of the evening was the Literary Achievement Award, a recent addition to the ceremony, having been instated in 2008. Despite its brief history, the award has already racked up an intimidating list of winners —among them Oscar winners Steven Zaillian, Eric Roth, Paul Haggis and distinguished novelist Dennis Lehane. For the first time, the selection committee awarded the honor to a screenwriting partnership: Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry, Oscar-winning screenwriters of Brokeback Mountain and several award-winning miniseries. When the writers took the stage, they focused on thanking each other for the fruitful partnership of over two decades.
For the Scripter Award itself, the committee chose six finalists this year rather than the usual five, a result of a tie. The finalists were Stephen Chbosky, author, screenwriter and director of The Perks of Being a Wallflower; Chris Terrio, the screenwriter of Argo, and Antonio Mendez and Bearman, authors of the nonfiction works the film was based on; Lucy Alibar and Benh Zeitlin, co-writers of Beasts of the Southern Wild; Yann Martel and David Magee, author and screenwriter of Life of Pi, respectively; Tony Kushner, screenwriter of Lincoln, and Doris Kearns Goodwin, author of Team of Rivals, upon which the film was based; and Matthew Quick and David O. Russell, author and screenwriter/director of Silver Linings Playbook, respectively.
Argo’s victory came as something of a surprise to pundits, considering the heated competition of the award — all six adaptations are tours de force, but it seems that nothing can stop Argo in taking almost every major American film award in the 2013 season. The film seems primed to continue this train to the Oscars later this month.
It seems evident that the ceremony itself will maintain its sterling tradition in years to come; the attendees all overflowed with positive remarks. USC trustee Ann Hill called it a “beautiful event” and seemed intent on coming again. Countless audience members shared her enthusiasm for this award, one that is remarkable for its positive spirit and its recognition of writing in multiple mediums.
Argo is only getting awards because Hollywood is in love with itself.  Such lackluster choices are very unbecoming of such a tremendous year for cinema.

College is often described as the best time of your life. Accordingly, it should expose students to a variety of experiences. Unfortunately, however, USA Today reports that fewer colleges are requiring students to take classes not directly related to their majors. In particular, budget cuts force schools to drop physical fitness and diversity requirements. Though dropping physical education requirements affords students more freedom, universities still need to make fitness a priority.
Compulsory college physical education classes were created with good intentions, yet they are limiting and ineffective. College students do not want to take another high school-style gym class complete with fitness tests and mandated activities. Instead, most want the freedom to choose how and when they exercise.
But rather than allowing students to fulfill their fitness requirements by choosing the specific physical education classes that appeal to them, many schools are abolishing their fitness requirements altogether. Though this allows students to focus on academically rigorous courses and possibly graduate faster, it neglects their physical health.
Ironically, as colleges do away with physical education, they are simultaneously constructing state-of-the-art gyms. According to USA Today, the cost of many of these “come-when-you-can fitness centers” is automatically added to the school’s tuition.
But what good is a brand-new gym if students do not know how to properly use it? Aside from the safety risks associated with improper form, most students do not know how to use the gym efficiently. The fact that a school has a fitness center on campus does not automatically make students more fit. Colleges need to motivate and instruct students so that they can make the most of their school’s gyms.
For instance, USC offers fitness classes through Dornsife but only allows four physical education units to count toward graduation. This translates to roughly two physical education classes and does not allow students to explore their fitness options. USC should not only make it easier for students to sample a variety of exercise options, but encourage it.
Many schools boast intramural sports leagues and group exercise classes, but simply offering these options is not enough. For college students on notoriously tight budgets,  the $75-per-semester fee for group exercise classes at USC can be enough to turn students away. Even though some colleges offer specific exercise classes as part of their curriculums, these classes displace academic courses.
According to the president-elect of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, Steve Mitchell, “Students and parents are less willing to pay for things that are outside their immediate academic disciplines.”
This is an attitude that can be seen at schools across the nation.
At USC, the university’s commitment to fitness needs to go beyond just exercise. Nutrition is especially important during high-stress times, such as finals week. During this time, McCarthy Quad is often packed with students looking for the free food that USC provides. However, instead of offering food such as In-N-Out, Chick-Fil-A and unhealthy food trucks during finals, SC should make nutritious food available to accommodate those late-night study sessions.
Clearly, colleges need to teach more than academic and career-related skills. USC needs to prepare students for life and teach them how to manage their obligations while staying fit and healthy. Despite programs, such as USC’s “BeFit. BeWell” campaign, there is still room for improvement. Colleges need to promote lifelong habits for success beyond academics.
USC can make changes to help motivate and educate students about how they can stay in top mental and physical form. Offering free classes on how to safely and effectively use the gym will help students make the most of the school’s fitness facility. Healthier dining options will also help integrate healthy living into the school’s culture. These changes will do more than stave off the freshman 15. Rather, they will hopefully create healthy habits to last a lifetime.
After all, college is “the best time of your life” to learn how to live your best life.
 
Veronica An is an undeclared freshman. 
College needs fitness options. But the practice of doing exercise daily should come in to the mind of students well before the college. Say in the schools. We have to make it clear that one should be healthy with good workout routine to be sound in mind….
Thanks for this well-written article! I do have a question though. When you say:
“However, instead of offering food such as In-N-Out, Chick-Fil-A and unhealthy food trucks during finals, SC should make nutritious food available to accommodate those late-night study sessions.”
What foods do you think should be made available instead?

It’s been nearly two months since the events of the horrific Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting took place. Since then, those across all forms of media have dissected the story from every possible angle — composing and recomposing the narrative of events so as to help make sense of such a vile and surreal act.
In the same amount of time, between Dec. 14 of last year and Feb. 8 of this year, 65 individuals were murdered in the city of Chicago. The makeup of these individuals is overwhelmingly from one group: young black males. Of these 65 homicides, 22 of the victims were children under the age of 18.
The events that transpired at Sandy Hook Elementary are, without a doubt, tragic. There is no question that the deranged murder of young children and their teachers garnered the attention of national news. And it’s understandable that millions across the country were so shocked that the shooting happened. On the surface, it might appear as if the circumstances and background between events in Newtown and Chicago are inherently different. But one cannot ignore the fact that the result is very much one in the same.
With the exception of a quick story occasionally acknowledging the fact that the homicide rate in Chicago is dramatically higher now than it has been in recent memory, the events transpiring in Chicago go widely unreported on a daily basis. In this, it can be said that the news coming out of Chicago is news of statistics, not humanity. This begs the question of why? Why is the reality that 22 minors were killed in the streets of Chicago not on the front page of every newspaper in America?
The answer is shockingly simple: It’s not news.
The murder of 22 children in a poor area of Chicago is not news because the killing of young, minority males occurs on a daily basis all across the country. Instead of being outraged and shocked at such occurrences, we as a society have grown desensitized to them quite simply because of their frequency, and the ease of dismissing these homicides as “gang violence which would never affect my children or myself.”
This mindset is not confined to Chicago. A comment on a Los Angeles Times article last year detailing the murder of a 15-year-old Latino boy named Miguel Sanchez in North Hollywood dismissed him simply as “another dead gangbanger.”
It is important to consider just what the implications of this mindset are. For those of us who are lucky enough to be born into a life that does not expose us to the dangers of gang violence, the realities of gang violence seem far enough away to simply declare these homicides as part of a different world.
This is a mistake, and one that has found itself deeply rooted in modern American society.
Coverage of these events is not considered, mostly because there is no demand. Media coverage is dictated quite finely by economics. In order to sell ad space, media outlets such as newspapers and TV channels — broadcast and cable alike — must sell stories in order to gather the largest audience. Evidently, the stories that are successful must offer something off the beaten path. A 16-year-old black male who was shot and killed in the 3400 block of West 59th Place is not off the beaten path.
The murder of minority individuals, most often by other minority individuals through gang violence, is a bitter reality that plays out across the United States on a daily basis. It is regrettable that these killings go unreported simply because they are deemed unimportant.
The 22 murdered children in Chicago come from families themselves. They have mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and friends who all valued their lives as much as anyone else values their own friends and family. It’s harrowing, to say the least, that their lives are deemed less valuable simply because of their color, economic status or location of birth.
It is time that we take interest in all of our people; horror, heartbreak and sadness knows no color line. It affects us all, and by only finally shining a light on the issue can the problem begin to be fixed.

Last week, NBC News published a leaked U.S. Justice Department “white paper” that seeks to supply a legal rationale for the targeted killing, without a trial, of an American citizen believed to be a “senior operational leader of al-Qa’ida or an associated force … who poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States.”
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
Facing pressure from the public, President Barack Obama on Wednesday supplied the Senate Intelligence Committee with a classified memo — a brief of the documents whose aim is to illustrate just why the administration’s actions are legal.
This “white paper” was provided to U.S. senators last summer after they requested the Justice Department provide a rationale behind the killing of American citizens Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan, who led a self-described “media jihad.” The “white paper” was, however, merely a substitute for a more detailed, classified memo that the Justice Department has kept hidden from Congress — the one in which Obama turned over last week.
Certainly, it would be irresponsible to restrict the military from killing an American citizen that posed a real threat to the nation. American citizenship, while guaranteeing a great number of rights, cannot be used to shield people who actively seek to inflict harm on the United States.
It would be equally irresponsible, however, to accept this paper’s combination of vague protocol and rejection of judicial review. Though the intentions of the administration are sincere, the actual details surrounding the legality of the killing are blurry.
A statement by the American Civil Liberties Union called the document “a stunning overreach of executive authority,” which is an accurate description of a program that enables the executive branch to act as the judge, jury and executioner of American citizens.
The paper requires that “an informed, high-level official” determine that the targeted American citizen “poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States.” Not only does the paper fail to accurately describe who this “official” would be, it stops short of providing any detail about how the decision of the official would be reviewed. Further, the paper defines “imminent threat” so loosely that it is robbed of any meaning. The document asserts that leaders of al-Qaida and “associated forces” — another ambiguous term — are constantly plotting against the U.S. and, therefore, pose an imminent threat at all times.
In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, which the paper cites, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution “most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches [of government] when individual liberties are at stake.”
Yet this paper declares that any judicial oversight or review would be improper, thus immunizing the executive branch from being held responsible for wrongful deaths.
Indeed, the flimsy logic suggests that the Justice Department was trying to dig up a legal basis for a decision that had already been made.
In public, it has never been officially acknowledged that the White House authorized the drone strike that killed al-Awlaki. And it was only last year that the Obama administration acknowledged that it has a targeted killing program with drones. It is a far cry from Obama’s promise that his administration would be “the most open and transparent” in history.
In a proper exercise of its right to oversight, a bipartisan group of senators recently threatened to reject Obama’s nominees for CIA director and defense secretary unless they received access to the secret documents. To truly gain legal legitimacy for these activities, Obama must not forget that though he is the leader of the free world, he still does not hold autonomous power, and Congress is a controlling branch of the government.
Without our concrete system of checks and balances, future leaders will be able to abuse the power given to them. Obama must respect the power of Congress and the Supreme Court and they, in turn, will respect his authority. If Congress is ignored, the precedent this would set for future administrations is disturbing: In times of war, the power of the president need not be checked.
Though Obama handed over the papers, it was only after facing pressure from Congress, the media and the public. It is time that our government ceases to keep secrets from its citizens and explains their actions. After all, if you have done nothing wrong, why all the secrets?
