The Price School of Public Policy, in connection with the Mount Vernon Association, hosted the first of its Borthwick Lecture Series on Tuesday.
Cherry Tree · USC professor Kevin Starr spoke at an event discussing George Washinton’s connection with the Western frontier. – Min Haeng Cho | Daily Trojan
The discussion on George Washington was sponsored by alumna Maribeth Borthwick, a vice regent for the Mount Vernon Association. USC Professor Kevin Starr spoke on how the West sculpted young Washington and how Washington sculpted the west.
The Mount Vernon Association, whose relationship with USC began last October, aims to preserve Washington’s home in Mount Vernon. It has established a library dedicated to Washington and his upbringing, time in the military and presidency. This collaboration came about through the work of Professor David Sloane, also of the Price School, and Douglas Bradburn, professor at Binghamton University and director of the new library.
Bradburn introduced the lecture with a vibrant sense of humor, joking about his alma mater, which shares the Trojan as a mascot. His passion for the Mount Vernon Association and their evolving mission was evident.
“The Mount Vernon Lady’s Association, at a time when women couldn’t even vote, created a national organization to raise the money to buy [Mount Vernon] and save it. In the last decade they added to that mission and education plank,” Bradburn said. “This new presidential library is part of that new educational mission. The house is transforming from a historic home to a unique educational institution.”
Bradburn sees this presence in the West as a necessary part of the national scope of Mount Vernon. Due to USC’s continual rise to intellectual prominence, this partnership seemed inevitable, Bradburn said.
Sloane sees the event as beneficial for West Coast students, who live far from, as he calls it, “that place of first democracy,” Washington D.C. He also, however, sees something important for students from the East Coast.
“[East Coast students] get to hear Kevin talk about how Washington thought about opportunities of America through the lens of the West,” Sloane said. “One of the reasons they came to USC is similar to the reason that Washington became a teenager surveying the West. He was looking for opportunities just like they are looking for opportunities.”
Starr’s lecture focused on how these westward opportunities shaped Washington while he was a surveyor and militiaman.
“My sense of Washington comes from the standard biographies, and of course the 152 page of published correspondence, which I recommend you all read; it’ll bring out a new Washington to you, Washington the writer,” Starr said. “All of us readily acknowledge the intellect of the other founding fathers and mothers. But we sometimes overlook this imaginative and intellectual side of George Washington because he did not attend Harvard or Yale but learned based on his own readings.”
Starr argued that Washington’s higher education was in fact the Western Frontier of the colonies, present-day Ohio. He proposed that Washington developed his imagination and intellect from his time on that border.
He suggested that Washington’s relation to the West echoes even today, with the Northwest Ordinance of 1784 imbued with his populist opinions on expansion. Starr even noted that Washington was a fine dancer with good taste in architecture thanks to his relation to both Europe and the Western Frontier.
Though no westward expansion happens today, Bradburn believes the frontier still lives on in the modern-day spirit of innovation, and Sloane connects the West’s association with freedom with modern day California.
Ultimately, Bradburn believed the Borthwick Series, the Price School and the Mount Vernon Association represent what this generation needs.
“One of the things we want to emphasize is to try and convince people to chose public service, to take up the challenge of trying to serve the public good,” Bradburn said. “[Washington’s] story is a great way to understand what that could mean. I think that your generation, which is close to my generation, there’s a real desire for a call to action, to be pushed, to say you can be great and can make the world a better place.”
More Borthwick lectures are to follow as this partnership grows. The lecture in full will be posted to the Price School’s YouTube Channel.

The Political Student Assembly, in partnership with the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ School of International Relations, held a conference Tuesday concerning U.S.-Australian relations and the rise of the Pacific Rim in world politics.
The event was sponsored by G’Day USA, an Australian think tank dedicated to promoting U.S.-Australia relations through fundraisers and its website. Allied with the Australian Consolate-General, G’Day USA is sponsored by the Dow Chemical Company, Chevron and the Australian Trade Commission.
Consisting of four panels and a lunch, the event attracted notable experts on Pacific Rim policy, such as Isaac Stone Fish, associate editor of Foreign Policy, and Lisa Scaffidi, Lord Mayor of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia. These panelists were chosen by Justin Bogda (Director of PSA), Christina Gray (Assistant Director of Programming for the School of International Relations) and Cate Partain, a senior majoring in international relations and an intern at the Australia Consulate-General.
“I reached out to the School of International Relations because they wanted do a partnership with PSA at some point this year,” Bogda said. “We wanted to have a large conference at USC at one point, and from there we worked with the Australia consulate to get different officials and experts on these topics.”
Partain expressed optimism in collaborating with the university.
“It’s really about giving the best experience to the people who will be in attendance,” Partain said. “At the consulate, we were very excited to work with USC, to make sure that students were aware that this is an opportunity. It’s an amazing networking event for USC students.”
These networking opportunities came during the first panel, titled “U.S. and Australian Alliance in the Asia-Pacific.” The panel featured Kim Beazly, Australian ambassador to the United States and Jeff Bleich, former U.S. ambassador to Australia.
The second panel, “Growing Regional Trade through the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),” addressed Trade Promotion Authority and TPP, two trade agreements that could affect U.S.-Australia relations. The authorities on this panel, including former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Mickey Kantor, supported the agreements.
In the third panel, “China, the U.S., and Australia,” experts discussed the new assertiveness of China within the Pacific and whether or not Australia has to choose between the U.S. and China. From the Australian perspective, presented by Robert Hill, the former Australian Defense Minister, such a decision isn’t even in the minds of Australian officials.
“Business Opportunities and Challenges of an Expanding Asian Middle Class,” the final panel, presented economic, health and political issues of the expanding middle class in Asia, with its effects on air quality in the Pacific, tourism and the film industry. Scaffidi discussed how Perth and Western Australia hold economic significance in the region.
“We’ve actually trademarked this term, ‘in the zone,’” Scaffidi said. “We recognize that Western Australia is in the same time zone as 61 percent of the world’s population, and we use that as a marketing point. We are a very strong connector for that reason. In regards to the growth of the middle class, it’s a great opportunity to our state.”
Gray felt that the event was a huge success, particularly due to USC’s ability to draw major figures such as Scaffidi.
“I think G’Day USA in partnering with USC was attracted to the School of International Relations,” Gray said. “You already have a great range of faculty and research and students who are actively involved in public diplomacy, and that focus is on international affairs. It’s a faculty base that opens itself to the idea of opening itself up as a university to other governments.”
Bogda, however, sees these events’ success as being in the hands of the students.
“[Students] have to attend. They have to tell their professors that they are interested in these kinds of events,” he said. “I’m hoping that in the future we can get more and more students to come out. If you‘re studying economics or international trade this is an opportunity to hear ambassadors speak on real-world things now.”

Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson spoke to South Area students in the Marks Hall lounge Tuesday.
Wesson talked to freshmen about his journey in college and how he came to be a politician.
The president had no plans to attend college, instead planning to work as an assemblyman for Chevrolet where his father worked. When his family relocated to Montclair, N.J., he found himself in a completely different environment. His peers planned to go to college and followed a different lifestyle than what Wesson had envisioned for himself.

“Because of the peer pressure, I had to go to college,” he said.
Wesson went on to attend Lincoln University, the first historically African American university in the United States. He was the first to go to college in his family, and was completely unaware of what college would be like.
“I’ll be totally honest with you. What I majored in was girls and cheap wine,” Wesson said.
There was a turning point, however, when he met Ron Dellums, a former mayor of Oakland. Dellums was a guest speaker at Wesson’s fraternity Alpha Phi Alpha, and the future city council president was responsible for giving him a tour around campus as part of the escort committee.
Wesson describes Dellums as the first speaker to send chills down his arms as he talked about important social issues, such as civil rights. Talking to Dellums more and more, Wesson soon abandoned his previous view of politicians as a class separate from regular citizens.
“As we spent the day, I kept saying to myself, ‘This guy is normal,’” Wesson said.
Inspired by Dellums’ speech, Wesson told his fraternity brothers that he hoped to emulate Dellums’ success one day.
From that point on, he had the vision of becoming a public servant, and put great effort into achieving his goal by getting better grades and focusing.
His hard work paid off when he was unanimously voted to become the Speaker of the California State Assembly in 2002. Wesson recalls that Dellums came to his swearing-in ceremony and cried.
The city council president emphasized the importance of political leaders to those in attendance.
“I don’t know who here wants to be involved in politics, but trust me, someone has to be.”
Wesson also stressed the necessity for students to get out and vote. That’s the only way to make sure that the right people get elected into office, he suggested. Many people lost elections that they should have won because of the low voting turnout, Wessen said.
“This country will be so much better if you guys engage,” he said.
Attending students seemed highly interested in Wesson’s story and level of passion.
“I liked that he was very conversational and he was passionate, which is important if you want to be successful in anything,” said Shanelle Sua, a freshman majoring in international relations global business.
Wesson’s discussion of the Los Angeles 10th district opened students’ eyes to the reality of their surroundings as well.
“What he said helped us realize what community we’re actually living in,” said Alice Kim, an undeclared freshman.
Tim Biblarz, an associate professor of sociology and a south area faculty member, contacted Wesson about speaking to USC students. He has been an admirer of Wesson’s work in the 10th district.
As a homeowner in the area, Biblarz had the opportunity to see changes implemented by Wesson as they were happening. He saw the roads get repaved, multiple Starbucks get built, the old Magic Johnson theater change to state-of-the-art movie theaters, and now Baldwin Hills mall is getting reshaped.
“All of this I witnessed as a homeowner and neighbor under Herb Wesson’s watch, and so I started admiring him from that perspective,” Biblarz said.
Wesson successfully carried out multiple projects, including the economic development on Wilshire and Westward as well as Wilshire and Vermont. He has further plans to fix the poor infrastructure in the area.

The university has implemented a revised Social Events Policy for activities involving alcohol or loud noise, effective Jan. 1.
According to the university’s new official policy, the revisions are being implemented “in an effort to enrich the academic experience while maintaining the importance of safety and security within the campus community.”
In its release, USC Student Affairs notes that the previous policies did not prove to be adequate solutions.
“Social event policies are intended to offer guidance and ensure safety, but at times the previous version of those policies may have hampered efforts to provide healthy outlets for students to socialize,” the new policy says.
Several student leaders and administration members alike signed the new policy, including Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and Chief/Executive Director of DPS John Thomas. USG co-signed this updated policy under President Christian Kurth.
USG expressed optimism in the revisions laid out for the updated policy.
“At USG, we believe the new Social Events Policy is going to take great strides towards clarifying for everyone how programming and social events work both on and off campus,” said Olivia Diamond, Senior Director of Communications for USG, in a statement.
Diamond notes the policy was significant for its successful collaboration between student groups and administration.
“This specific policy was unique and monumental because it was the first time students and administrators were able to collaborate and speak candidly about social life at USC,” Diamond said.
Under the new policy, any university-recognized social gatherings must be organized according to the university’s new procedures. The hosts must receive the necessary clearances from the university in order to proceed with their event.
The time allotted for events to take place is now dependent on whether or not alcohol is present. Social events that are not serving alcohol may take place any day of the week, but alcohol-related events are limited to Thursday until 12 a.m. and on Friday and Saturday until 2 a. m.
Along with the revised time restraints, the university requires that the events offer non-alcoholic drinks and food in “sufficient quantities,” as well as enforce a strict no-alcohol policy to those under 21. All of those in attendance of social events must observe federal, state and local laws, which most notably includes not serving alcohol to minors.
In addition, music and recordings cannot be louder than 90 dBA 50 feet from the source of the noise in order to reduce local disturbances and social events cannot occur on university-designated study days and final days.
Student reaction to this new social policy seemed negative.
“I don’t think ending parties at midnight on Thursday will really help because if people know the party is ending at midnight they will just get drunk earlier,”  said Jennifer Marr, a junior majoring in international relations global business.
Jonathan Marty, a junior majoring in history, believed the new policy was unjust.
“The social policy isn’t really fair because transports happen at every college. They should just educate people better.”
Others, however, were just happy for the catering.
“I love the food part, but that’s just because I like eating,” said Cara Madrid, a sophomore majoring in fine arts. “I feel that’s kind of smart because a lot of people don’t eat anything and that’s why they get more drunk.”

Through the eyes of his coach and teammates, USC freshman water polo player Jon Walters is remembered as a warrior who fought for his team in the pool and a loving, spirited and warmhearted friend on land.
Remembrance ·Freshman Jon Walters will forever be a warrior in the pool and beloved companion to those who knew and loved him. – Photo courtesy of Tim Tessalone
Just a month before his tragic heart attack, Walters played an integral role on the USC squad that defeated University of Pacific, 12-11 in overtime, to give the program its sixth consecutive national title.
“We would not have won a championship without [Walters],” USC head water polo coach Jovan Vavic said.
Little did anyone know, the national championship game would be his last game as a USC player.
The Trojan Family lost the 19-year-old Walters on Jan. 8, but his memory and legacy as an NCAA champion and an ideal teammate lives on in and out of the water.
“Jon was one of the most universally loved people I have ever met,” redshirt sophomore Aleck Ryner said. “He was a champion in the pool and an even better person out of it. I’m going to miss him every day for the rest of my life.”
Before coming to USC, Walters was a superstar at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Calif., where he won two CIF titles, was the 2012 CIF Player of the Year and was a member of the U.S Junior National Team.
Austin Fletcher, a junior at USC and former high school teammate of Walters remembered him as a fantastic teammate with a contagious winning attitude and a knack for inspiring their team, which would go on to win a CIF championship.
“His spirit brought our team together since he would not take anything less than winning, and our team adopted that [mentality] and wouldn’t have won a title without him,” Fletcher said. “There’s not a person that knew him that didn’t love him.”
Vavic still remembers the first time he saw Walters play while recruiting him in high school. Walters immediately made an impression as a towering, yet quick and physical player.
“He was a man above the boys and was unguardable, like Shaquille O’Neal,” Vavic said. “It was beautiful to watch him play.”
His coach reminisced about how Walters was an ideal player — one that every coach would want to have on his team.
“He was a warrior, fun loving, always smiling, selfless — and all of his teammates really loved him,” Vavic said.
Vavic asserted that a big reason why Walters was so beloved by his teammates and enjoyed playing with him was because he was a fighter in the pool.
“He would fight for his teammates until he had nothing left in him,” Vavic said.
His teammates reinforced how special it was to be able to play alongside Jon and consider him a friend.
“Jon wasn’t your average teammate,” senior two-meter Connor Virjee said. “He had the heart of a Trojan. He was always the warrior we needed in the water and the gentle giant out of the water. Anyone who was able to talk to Jon for even a brief moment could witness how unique he was and knew Jon was destined for bigger and better things. I know that he will forever live on in our hearts and can never leave our thoughts.”
With his spirited persona, Walters was able to touch every person he met in a positive way, according to senior Jeremy Davie.
“I know that my life will be changed forever after knowing [Walters] and I am a better person for it,” Davie said.
Senior utility Mace Rapsey, said he would miss Walters’ passionate attitude while always putting his teammates first.
“Jon was the nicest, most caring and best teammate anyone could ever ask for,” Rapsey said. “I will miss him greatly but will always remember Jon as a warrior, legend, and a great mate.”
Over the course of this past season, Walters battled an elbow injury that sidelined him for about six weeks, according to Vavic.
Motivated by a fierce determination to obtain his first national championship, Walters returned from his injury and came up huge for the Trojans in the conference tournament that would eventually send them to the NCAA Tournament. Walters finished his freshman season with 17 goals from the two-meter position.
“He stepped up big when we really needed him,” Vavic said.
 
Apparent from the kind words of his current and former teammates and coach, Jon Walters truly embodied what it meant to be a Trojan.
 
The Trojan family lost one of its greatest warriors and is deeply saddened by his passing.
Walters is survived by his parents, Jacque and Bill, his three brothers, Mike, Matt, and James and his sister Ali.
A memorial service to honor Walters will take place on Jan. 18 at Mariners Church of Irvine at 11 a.m.
Jon Walters was a sweet & kind young 19 year old USC Water Polo team player who now is in the presence of God Almighty.  He will be Greatly missed!   We encourage all of you to keep his dear parents Bill & Jacque along with his brothers James, Matt & sister Ali in your prayers.  Jon was a believer & he is in Heaven at this very moment enjoying all that God prepared for him.  Looking forward for all of you to come and Remember him together as we Celebrate his Life at Mariners Church of Irvine at 11:00 AM.  Thank you all for your prayers, Love in His Grace- Pastor Joe.

USC football is entering into a state of flux for the second straight offseason — to give you an idea of what exactly that means, look no further than San Jose Mercury News sports writer Jon Wilner. Last week, Wilner released his projection for the preseason top 25 ranking, which had the Trojans as the eighth best team in the nation.
It’s clearly far too early to be making pre-season projections, but the early departure of juniors safety Dion Bailey, defensive end George Uko, tight end Xavier Grimble, offensive lineman Marcus Martin and wide receiver Marqise Lee might give the Trojan faithful reason for pause about next season’s prospects. This should not be the case.
Though the Trojans are still reeling from unprecedented NCAA sanctions and the departures do hurt their depth, the big names departing were unlikely to fit into the Trojans’ ground-and-pound system from last season.
Grimble, who was one of former quarterback Matt Barkley’s favorite end zone options in the Trojans’ ill-fated 2012 run, suffered from a statistical drop-off in every category with junior quarterback Cody Kessler at the helm. Grimble’s reception numbers feel from 29 to 25, and he had 271 yards the entire 2013 season as opposed to the 316 he had as a sophomore. He also had a mere two touchdowns on the entire season as the Trojan offense came to favor running the ball in the end zone. This is not to take away from Grimble’s draft prospects: the 6-foot-5, 250 pound tight end still has excellent hands and would be an asset in the NFL — it’s just a shame the Trojans did not incorporate tight ends into the playcalling last season to showcase his talents and increase his draft stock, especially when considering Kessler’s reliance on intermediate routes and checkdowns.
Grimble’s decision to leave for the draft was to the chagrin of head coach Steve Sarkisian, who in his opening press conference stated his desire to incorporate tight ends into the offense in the upcoming season. Regardless, senior Randall Telfer will be returning to play for the Trojans for one more year to give Kessler some more sure-handed offensive firepower.
The biggest name to leave is undoubtedly Lee, the 2012 Biletnikoff Award Winner. Lee suffered from a far more dramatic statistical drop off amid injury woes and trouble adjusting to Kessler at quarterback. The 2012 First Team All-American had a comparatively pedestrian 791 yards and four touchdowns on 57 receptions this season, as opposed to the 1721 yards and 14 touchdowns he amassed in 2012.
2013, however, was undoubtedly the year of junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor: The receiver developed a rapport with Kessler, whereas Lee never seemed fully comfortable working with the new quarterback. Lee’s season was characterized by costly drops, underthrown passes and errant back shoulder throws that missed their mark. Lee’s ineffectual chemistry with Kessler cost him dearly this season: the former consensus top 10 draft pick now enters the NFL Draft with a significant contingent of doubters to disprove. There’s no doubt that Lee could make a serious impact in the NFL, and should Lee fall out of the top 15, it’s almost certain that any team picking him up will be getting a considerable bargain.
How this is beginning to read is that the players leaving for the draft are doing so at a time that would be most advantageous to them. USC is undergoing yet another transition. The Trojans are in for another quarterback battle this spring where there may be yet another quarterback change depending on the performance of junior quarterback Max Wittek and sophomore quarterback Max Browne.
The primary reason the Trojans will be competitive in the coming season is the same reason they were so effective in 2013: defense. Junior defensive lineman Leonard Williams, senior defensive back Josh Shaw and senior linebacker Hayes Pullard are all slated to return next season under Sarkisian. Bailey’s position will likely be filled by former Rivals.com five star recruit and sophomore defensive back Leon McQuay III. Stellar sophomore safety Su’a Cravens will likely reprise his starting role. All things considered, the Trojans look poised to dominate on the defensive side of the ball next season.
Despite the departure of Martin, Lee and Grimble, the offense also leaves more upside next season. Junior wide receiver George Farmer is likely to return from his season-ending knee surgery in time for fall camp, and Agholor will have another offseason to get adjusted with Sarkisian’s playbook. The Trojans also honed their running options with redshirt junior running backs Javorius Allen and Tre Madden coming off a strong season. The incorporation of former Scout.com five star running backs and sophomores Ty Isaac and Justin Davis is sure to give the running attack a shot in the arm come fall.
Though any preseason predictions are premature at this point, it’s hard to argue with Wilner’s assessment of the Trojans next season. With such a strong showing of younger talent only developing further experience, the steady improvement of Kessler and the return of key defensive players, it’s entirely plausible the Trojans could be a serious contender for a playoff berth next season.

As much as I would like to be optimistic about next season, we need to be realistic. The 5 early departed juniors will hurt USC because the overall numbers are so low (again). Except for Lee, none of them should have left early if they wanted to maximize their NFL earnings, but I digress. USC will have a lot of talent with the biggest question mark the OL again. But, there will be at most 72 scholarship players (plus any walk-ons who get scholarships) assuming no academic or injury issues. There is no reason not to expect similar injuries as 2013, and this means that the Trojans will practice and play with 50 scholarships athletes. Who will be missing is anyone’s guess, but the depleted numbers will take their toll especially in the 2nd half of games.
So, yes, this is the time to be optimistic about the 2014 season but reality tells us that the NCAA’s ridiculous sanctions will create the same numbers problem that we have been experiencing. Coach O, the players, and some luck did a great job of getting the team to play better than anyone expected for most of the games (except ND and UCLA), but it will be almost impossible to exceed that under the circumstances and achieve the lofty rankings some are projecting and we would all like to see.

No. 5 USC shook off some sloppy offensive errors and relied on a powerful freshmen duo to turn back No. 7 UC Irvine, the two-time defending national champions, in a thrilling five-set victory (20-25, 25-21, 23-25, 25-19, 15-10) on Tuesday night.
Big spike · Micah Christenson sets up 6-foot-8 outside hitter Robert Feathers for the kill. Feathers amassed 10 kills in Tuesday’s match. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
“It feels good, [UC Irvine] is a heck of a team,” said USC head coach Bill Ferguson. “Our two programs have been battling for years now, and it’s always a good night of volleyball when our two teams play.”
Outside hitter Lucas Yoder continued his impressive freshman campaign, leading the Trojans (3-0, 2-0) with 21 kills. Freshman middle blocker Andy Benesh was nearly flawless, recording 15 kills with 0 errors on 19 attempts for a stellar .789 hitting percentage.
The Trojans certainly weren’t mistake-free, as they committed 30 errors compared to just 21 from the Anteaters (3-3, 0-2). But staring down a 2-1 deficit after three sets, the Trojans beared down and logged just four errors in the last two sets combined to pull off the comeback.
“That was a very fun game,” Yoder said. “We didn’t play too well the first couple sets. UCI is a great team. But we got used to them and started playing better the next couple games to pull it out in five.”
Both teams held strong in the fourth set, amazingly splitting the frame’s first 16 points one-by-one. USC finally grabbed the frame’s first multi-point lead at 10-8, but the Anteaters hung tough and eventually cut the lead to 18-17. The Trojans finished strong with a 7-2 run, punctuated on a set point that featured multiple point-saving digs before the Anteaters’ Jeremy Dejno uncorked an unforced error to let USC tie the match at two sets apiece.
The fifth set started off inauspiciously for USC as Irvine held a 6-5 lead. But timely blocks by senior setter Micah Christenson and Benesh helped the Trojans steal the lead at 9-8. Yoder extended the lead with consecutive kills, sparking a 6-2 run to close the match.
Junior outside hitter Cristian Rivera ended the match emphatically with a booming kill on the right side that the Anteaters attempted to block but could only knock out of bounds for the winning point.
“Rivera gave us a huge lift,” Ferguson said. “He hit for gigantic numbers and was very efficient.”
Rivera finished with six kills and a .417 hitting percentage. Feathers, another key reserve, had 10 kills and a .562 hitting percentage to help overcome a nightmarish offensive performance from senior outside hitter Maddison McKibbin.
McKibbin logged just five kills compared to nine errors (-.211 hitting percentage), and was benched for most of the pivotal fifth set after starting the match over Rivera.
But Ferguson was nonplussed after the match, and expressed confidence in his rotation.
“Madison is in there to dig, block and play defense,” Ferguson said. “Our other [opposite hitters] are a little more offensive-minded. We tried to go defensive-minded at first, but we needed to get some kills on that side of the court to loosen it up for [Alex] Slaught and Yoder on the left side.”
And considering the showing of Benesh and Feathers in the middle, there wasn’t too much for Ferguson to complain about.
“We have arguably the best middle blocking core in the country,” Ferguson said. “We ran out the middle, spread out their blockers and hit [UC Irvine] in the seams … It was nice to beat [UC Irvine] in the clutch.”

After a tumultuous 2013 football season, the Trojans finally have some calm and stability in the offseason, just in time to prepare for recruiting season and spring practices. There have been many positive signs since Steve Sarkisian was announced as the Trojans’ new head coach both from a recruiting and from a coaching staff standpoint. On Tuesday, Sarkisian introduced his almost-complete coaching staff for the 2014 season.
Fresh faces · Steve Sarkisian brought five assistants with him from Washington. The Huskies were 0-12 the year before Sarkisian arrived. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
From last year’s staff, Sarkisian retained wide receivers coach Tee Martin and offensive coordinator Clay Helton — who led the Trojans to a 45-20 romp over Fresno State in the Royal Purple Las Vegas Bowl after recruiting coordinator and former interim head coach Ed Orgeron resigned.
In addition to these two tenured Trojan coaches, Sarkisian added six former assistant coaches from University of Washington to the coaching staff: associate offensive head coach and tight ends coach Marques Tuiasosopo, defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox, running backs coach and special teams coordinator Johnny Nansen, linebackers coach and recruiting coordinator Peter Sirmon, defensive backs coach Keith Heyward, and strength and conditioning coach Ivan Lewis.
Sarkisian also inked a deal with former San Francisco 49ers offensive line coach Tim Drevno to become the Trojans’ offensive line coach and running game coordinator.
“I wanted to make a staff that’s cohesive and that works well together,” Sarkisian said.
Heyward agreed with Sarkisian.
“I think we have good chemistry amongst our staff,” Heyward said. “We’re all really close in age and we all get along.”
The coaching staff is going to have to hit the ground running as recruiting season begins.
“The focus starts in Southern California, but we will reach across the country,” Sarkisian said of his recruiting strategy. “We’ve got a brand that can reach from the West Coast to the East Coast and everything in between.”
So far, five Trojans have already bought into the USC brand. Sarkisian says four players have already joined the Trojan family for the spring semester and are taking classes.
Sarkisian also mentioned that the Trojans are waiting for junior college transfer Claude Pelon to round out the spring additions to the Trojans’ roster.
Despite these mid-year additions, the entire coaching staff could not reiterate enough who the number one recruit for the 2014 class was: Hayes Pullard, who announced his return along with cornerback Josh Shaw.
“It’s huge,” Sirmon said of Hayes’ return. “Anytime you have transition you need somebody in the locker room who understands what’s best for the program and to help with the transition process, and on defense he’s going to be that guy.”
Sirmon knows he has big shoes to fill in replacing the beloved Orgeron, who served as the Trojans’ interim head coach following the dismissal of Lane Kiffin. Sirmon seems to have a grasp of what it will take to recruit the most elite players to the program.
“What I talk about is recruiting with humility,” Sirmon said. “Right now it’s a relationship business and we have to do a great job to foster it and to build it because there are guys out there that are tireless.”
Former NFL quarterback Tuiasosopo joins the Trojans’ coaching staff as the associate offensive head coach and tight ends coach. Tuiasosopo left the University of Washington after leading the team to win the Fight Hunger Bowl over BYU as the interim head coach.
Tuiasosopo brings his expertise as both a successful player and coach. In 2000, he was named Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year and Rose Bowl MVP in his senior season at Washington. He then went on to play quarterback in the NFL. Tuiasosopo passed on an offer by Washington’s new head coach, Chris Petersen, to remain the tight ends coach at Washington to rejoin Sarkisian at USC.
Drevno, the current San Francisco 49ers assistant coach, will also be joining Sarkisian after succeeding at both the collegiate and professional levels. Drevno has been a part of head coach Jim Harbaugh’s coaching staff from the University of San Diego to Stanford and now the 49ers.
“Tim Drevno is the one common factor in all three of those stops,” Sarkisian said. “He’s been the architect behind that offensive line and their physicality — their ability to run the football — and that’s something that this program will be built upon has well.”
Sarkisian added that he wanted to make sure Drevno’s professional experience was an impact hire for both current players and recruits to be coached by an NFL offensive coach.
Once the 49ers’ season concludes, Drevno will assume the role of offensive line and running game coordinator. With veteran offensive linemen in junior Max Tuerk and redshirt sophomore Chad Wheeler along with talented running backs such as redshirt junior Buck Allen returning, Drevno should have a seamless transition in his new position.
Offensive coordinator Clay Helton and wide receivers coach Tee Martin are the only two coaches who remain from the old coaching staff. Helton will retain his title as offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach after coaching the Trojans to the Las Vegas Bowl victory as the second interim head coach this past season.
As for Martin, he says he’s convinced the Trojans will be in good shape at the wide receiver position despite star wideout Marqise Lee entering the draft much to the dismay of fans and coaches alike.
“You can’t replace a Marqise Lee, that just doesn’t happen,” Martin said. “But I will say I’m excited about Nelson Agholor, his leadership skills and how much better he’s gotten.”
Lee’s injury also allowed freshman Darreus Rogers to get his feet wet. The Trojans are also expecting redshirt freshman Steven Mitchell and senior wide receiver George Farmer, who were both sidelined by ACL injuries, to see some action come spring practice.
With players set to leave home, one new coach is returning home. Nansen, a native of Long Beach, Calif., jumped at the opportunity to return home. He will coach the running backs and special teams.
On the other side of the field, the defensive coordinator will be Wilcox, who plans to adjust the defensive scheme a bit while leaving a great amount of what is already in place untouched.
“Our job is to kind of find out what we’re best at and also to find out what we need from a schematic standpoint to play and be successful,” Wilcox said.
The only position to be determined is the defensive line coach.
“We’re going to do our best to hire another great defensive line coach for this football team,” Sarkisian said.
Bo Davis was originally set to assume the role and after beginning to settle in, he had a change of heart leading to his departure for Alabama under head coach Nick Saban.
“We all agreed it was probably the best thing for Bo to head back closer to home to be near his family,” Sarkisian said.
The Trojans look ahead with a roller coaster ride of a season behind them. The current focus is for the players to be a “fresh, healthy, and well-conditioned football team by the start of spring practice,” Sarkisian said. “Every guy in this program’s getting a clean slate.” The coaching staff and players alike have the opportunity to make something special of this upcoming season.

Grand Central Market has become Downtown Los Angeles’ new culinary hotspot as of late. New vendors pushing high-concept casual food including Sticky Rice, Horse Thief BBQ and Eggslut have all opened within the past year. Adding to the growing list of affordable upmarket vendors is Downtown Los Angeles Cheese, which according to GCM’s website, is Downtown L.A.’s “first full-service cheesemonger.”
Deli bread · Though their cheeses are the main focus, DTLA Cheese also features mouthwatering sandwiches in its deli. With pre-made and made-to-order varieties, DTLA Cheese masterfully crafts each of its sandwiches and dishes to perfectly complement its various cheeses. – Sara Clayton | Daily Trojan
The cheese stand and deli opened up shop in Downtown’s historic marketplace late last month, and many of the patrons headed toward their favorite lunch spot inside the market stop in front of the shop’s massive display case.
To the untrained eye, DTLA Cheese’s refrigerator display is just any other glass-enclosed fridge, not unlike the ones found at Whole Foods Markets or Bristol Farms. To those serious about their cheeses, however, this is a small mecca of funk. DTLA Cheese’s smartly appointed staff stand likes sentries on a slightly raised platform behind the display case, blessing patrons with thin, yet opaque sample snippets of poet’s cheddar and wrapping up pie-like slices of brie aux truffes maison.
Though the imagery invoked by raised platforms and the hyperspecific nature of artisanal cheese might suggest (and justify) a steep price tag, many of DTLA Cheese’s offerings are fairly priced: a genuine Swiss Emmentaler, for example, runs $10.50 a pound, comparable to the price one would find in the refrigerated aisles at Trader Joe’s, and the aforementioned Poet’s Cheddar is $5.50 a pound.
Cheese-mongering often conjures notions of pretense and snobbery. The staff behind the counter at DTLA Cheese is serious about its cheese — but they’re equal parts knowledgeable and approachable, offering pairing suggestions and breaking down flavor profiles in layman’s terms to demystify the process behind the funk.
It would be completely acceptable if Cheese were merely this: a down-to-earth cheese-monger in the heart of Downtown L.A., the progenitor of intriguing, edible conversation pieces served on square plates in the high-rise apartments of the growing contingent of local young professionals. Instead, it’s also a deli counter, and DTLA Cheese just happens to also put out some of the best sandwiches this side of the 110 freeway.
Take, for instance, the pork loin and pecorino. A wonderfully crunchy, chewy, toasted baguette is stuffed with peppery arugula, a generous heap of roasted pork loin and an abundance of nutty, micro-grated pecorino romano. The sandwich itself is lacking a bit of an acidic zing for balance from the sauce verte, but the sheep’s milk-based pecorino packs a punch of pungency and rounds out the mellow, savory flavors quite nicely.
Pre-prepared cold sandwiches are just as thoughtfully conceived, if not a bit more focused: a simple ham and d’Affinois sandwich seems innocently simple (and a bit small for $5) at first glance, but it takes a bite — or 10 — to make a believer.
The d’Affinois cheese takes center stage in what’s hands down the best pre-prepared sandwich you’ll ever eat. D’Affinois, which looks, feels and initially tastes like brie, is actually made with ultra-filtered cow’s milk. The result is essentially all the richness of brie with a finish reminiscent of sweet butter. And yes, it’s every bit as good as it sounds. The ham isn’t anything exceptional, but that’s not the point: the cured meat is there to delicately counter-balance the cheese. The bread also plays a strong supporting role — the unusually resilient, chewy roll encourages thorough chewing so the eater can more fully experience the flavor profile of the d’Affinois.
Aside from sandwiches, DTLA Cheese also offers a variety of “raclettes.” The dishes, so named for a process of melting a part of a larger wheel of cheese, incorporate a form of melted cheese and other ingredients on a bed of perfectly cooked fingerling potatoes. The bacon and cheddar raclette tastes like a deconstructed baked potato. Unfortunately, the overall flavor of the cheddar fails to come through, though the potatoes and bacon are a great combination. The crème fraîche fails to materialize in any meaningful way, relegated to an unappetizing pool of grease at the bottom of the dish.
Overall, Downtown Los Angeles Cheese is a fantastic cheese shop that happens to put out some incredibly well-made sandwiches. Some of the more technically difficult dishes (such as the bacon and cheddar raclette) require some fine tuning before it can make a claim to being a destination as a lunch spot.

Happy Wednesday and Happy New Year to my Trojan family!
Before I begin this column, I would like to dedicate my writing to a friend and teammate who recently passed, Jon Walters.
On that note, I digress. This semester, it is my pleasure to be the Daily Trojan food columnist where I hope to provide you, my readers, audience and the occasional friend or foe, with delicious recipes, while educating you about our world, but from a foodie’s perspective. As a foodie, I don’t eat to live, I legitimately live to eat. Ask anyone who knows me — even a snack is a gourmet ordeal. Anyone can be a foodie.
Being a foodie is simple — you have to love food and not think about anything else. So enjoy my column as we take on a semester filled with food and holidays, on the daily.
Monday, Jan. 13, 2014 — National Peach Melba Day / Welcome back to school!
The Peach Melba is a fairly simple concept: poached peaches with a lovely, sweet peach sauce over vanilla ice cream — it’s a dessert created by Chef Georges Auguste Escoffier of France for the Australian soprano Nellie Melba upon her stay at the Savoy Hotel in London.
If you want to make this dish at home, be forewarned that it must be served in a silver dish, otherwise you are disgracing its history.
Tuesday, Jan. 14, 2014 — National Hot Pastrami Sandwich Day 
For those who aren’t fans of spicy food, you’re in the clear — “hot” in this situation means warm. When was the last time you had a mouth-watering, warm pastrami sandwich on fresh sourdough bread? Granted, if you’re from New York City, you could probably brag all day about the mom-and-pop delicatessens located on almost every block, where they know you by name and know you better than you know yourself, but they just know how to make a really good sandwich, so relax. This is the day that you make a change in your life. This is the day that you take a leap of faith and enjoy a savory hot pastrami sandwich — make sure to sound like you’re a New Yorker when you say “pastrami” while ordering — really make sure that the long “a” is there.

Wednesday, Jan. 15, 2014 — Strawberry Ice Cream Day
Oh, strawberry ice cream — the forgotten flavor no one thinks about because it is hidden in the shadow of chocolate and vanilla. Treat yourself to some strawberry ice cream today; I think you will be pleasantly surprised with the sweet sensation in your mouth, plus, with this week’s weather forecast, it will be a nice way to cool off.
Thursday,  Jan. 16, 2014 — National Fig Newton Day and International Hot and Spicy Food Day
To the people who can’t handle the spice, look away. To those who enjoy a good spicy meal, by all means, have at it; today is the day to do it.
Personally, I have never been a fan of fig newtons, the fig-filled cookies that your parents used to put in your lunches as a kid. You know, the ones you would trade for some kid’s Fruit Roll-Ups — or was that just me?
Friday,  Jan. 17, 2014 — Hot Buttered Rum Day
Hot Buttered Rum is a popular, warm cocktail that is enjoyed during the holidays, made of rum and caramelized sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract; this drink dates back to colonial times and is also an American five-piece progressive bluegrass group.
Saturday,  Jan. 18, 2014 — Peking Duck Day
Peking Duck is a very popular dish in China, and is now considered the country’s national dish. Peking Duck is served duck three ways: the first is  sliced skin with a little bit of succulent fat with some dipping sauce, the second is the duck meat served with what I refer to as Chinese tortillas, but in reality they are almost like crepes and the third way is in noodle, soup or stir fry form.
Peking Duck makes a beautiful roast center piece for a dinner party, but for a college student’s budget, it’s pretty pricey. Go try some duck. We’re so close to Chinatown, what’s stopping you?
Savory places in Los Angeles to get some great duck are Hong Yei Restaurant in San Gabriel, and if you’re feeling fancy, Wolfgang Puck’s Chinese-inspired WP24 and Tasty Duck.
Sunday,  Jan. 19, 2014 — National Popcorn Day 
Popcorn. Definition: the popping of dried kernels of corn by heating over a flame for a given period of time and adding lovely seasonings for flavor — I just made that up. Popcorn comes from corn, which can be dried into a seed or nut-like form, which can be heated to make a delightful low-calorie snack that people have been enjoying for centuries.
Recipe of the week! Quinoa Risotto with Shiitake Mushrooms, by Trader Joe’s
Ingredients:
4 tablespoons olive oil
7 ounces Shiitake Mushrooms, cleaned and rinsed
1 cup of quinoa, rinsed
5 cups vegetable broth, keep warm in pan
1/3 cup white wine
1 shallot, diced
1 clove garlic, minced
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
1/4 cup crème fraîche
Salt and pepper, to taste
 
Directions:
In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the sliced mushroom and sauté until golden and soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from skillet and set aside. Lower heat, add shallot and garlic to pan and sauté slowly until they begin to soften and become translucent, about 5 minutes.
Increase the heat to medium-high and add the quinoa. Stir for about 3 minutes until the quinoa is coated with oil and lightly toasted. Lower the heat to a simmer; add the wine and continue to stir until it is absorbed. Once the wine is absorbed, pour about 1/2 cup of warm broth into the quinoa and continue to stir and simmer until it is completely absorbed. Allow pan to almost dry out between additions of broth. Keep stirring in broth 1/2 cup at a time until the quinoa is creamy and the quinoa germ has burst, about 20 minutes. Taste for doneness (should be creamy and a little al dente) and add salt and pepper to taste.
Once the last addition of broth is almost absorbed, stir in the Parmesan cheese, remove from the heat, cover with a lid and let stand for 2 minutes to help develop the creamy texture. Then, stir in the mushrooms and créme fraîche. Serve with a sprinkle of parmesan on top.

In this generation, where our likes and dislikes represent who we are as individuals, our tastes in music, film and television shows are sources of pride. When it comes to algorithm-driven platforms such as Pandora for music or Netflix for film, we tend to have strong opinions on the recommendations we’re given. We don’t choose how we like a song on a scale of 1 to 5 — either a confident thumbs up or thumbs down.
As college students in a city that’s bursting with great culture, entertainment and food, it’s only natural for us to have opinions in all of these realms. But when it comes to recommendation services, there haven’t been any stand-out platforms that cover all of these aspects. Qloo, on the other hand, a multiple-domain discovery engine, is poised to successfully fill the void in this market.
Founded by USC alumnus Alex Elias, Qloo was in part a nod to USC and how his experience as a student inspired this mobile and web application.
“I have a special fondness for ’SC, a lot of these instincts I developed … these ideas really started when I was a student there,” Elias said.
At USC, in fact, Elias majored in philosophy and economics, two polar opposite disciplines, and almost picked up a minor in jazz studies. For his interest in cross-disciplinary studies, Elias was recognized as a USC Renaissance Scholar in 2009.
“If it weren’t for that formative experience at USC, Qloo might not have happened,” Elias said. “[Qloo] sort of developed from the idea that your interests can form and shape the way you relate to other areas as well.”
Elias, however, did not start Qloo at USC. In 2012, while finishing his second year in law school at New York University, Elias thought of the idea and decided that this was something he wanted to develop.
“I kind of ran with it and raised a bit of money in our first round,” Elias said. “Fast forward, and we’re a team of 10 based in New York. It’s an exciting project we’re taking on.”
The first thing to know about Qloo is that unlike single-domain concierge services, Qloo covers a wide range of interests including fashion, books, travel destinations and food, among others. And aside from just giving recommendations, Qloo’s main goal for each user is to encourage him or her to really get out in the world and explore.
“Folks can book a restaurant reservation, watch a movie trailer or even add a film to Netflix [through Qloo],” Elias said. “We don’t just want to be the start of the discovery process. We want to actually make it easier to fully take advantage of everything we’re offering.”
Here’s how Qloo works: Within each main category, there are also subcategories, such as “Legendary Lyrics” in music and “Late Night Munchies” in food. To give the app its user information, under each subcategory users can input five “qloos,” which Elias describes as, “a play on words [that] reflects something you love or how you are culturally.” So in the previous example for food, you could say “Chano’s” or “BCD Tofu.” The more qloos in each category, the more accurate the algorithm will be. Once you’ve given enough qloos, you can also “get qloos,” or scroll through personalized recommendations based on your likes. To improve the algorithm some more, you can swipe to the left to approve these recommendations or swipe to the right to express your disapproval.
Qloo can also take all of your tastes into consideration and apply them to your recommendations.
“I can say to Qloo, ‘Find me a film based on my taste in books.’ It’s this cross-domain idea that becomes incredibly powerful, that the algorithm is looking at what movies you might enjoy based on the choice of books you like,” Elias said.
Though Qloo is not a social network where you can directly add friends, you can look up “tastebuds,” or people who share your taste across Qloo’s categories, and grab qloos from them.
Currently, Qloo serves local personalized recommendations in Los Angeles, New York City, San Francisco, London and Chicago, and it isn’t a coincidence that these major cities also happen to be epicenters of culture. Luckily enough, Elias was already in New York City when he started Qloo, and believes that the city was the perfect place for Qloo’s headquarters.
“New York is kind of like the capital of food, publishing, restaurants and many other things,” Elias said. “And it makes sense. To a larger extent, products and companies tend to reflect the culture of where they are incubated.”
The Qloo network has 50,000 users and counting and plans to expand to more cities including Paris, Austin, Miami and Washington, D.C. The app is only available in Apple’s App Store at the moment, but will be released for Android in the next couple of months.
Sure, it may seem like Qloo is just another algorithm-driven app, but there’s more to it than just spitting out recommendation after recommendation.
“We’re bringing these different areas of culture and entertainment together,” Elias said. “Rather than going deep within one channel … we want to do better for people by taking a more complete picture.”

The observer of the ongoing revolution in dating culture would not be wrong to note the trend toward more casual relationships and the struggle of couples to interact in a way that produces a lasting bond. Hell, the particularly frustrated maverick might take to Facebook or the blogs.
Solange Castro wrote a play.
“I think people want to see their real lives reflected in art,” she said. “Even without technology, relationships are crazy and confusing, but technology has added this whole other level that has made it infinitely nuttier.”
Castro, a Yale graduate turned comedian, playwright and blogger, observed that all around her, people were just too lackadaisical about their relationships.
“The way people were dating seemed very college or high school — not very serious about finding or valuing a relationship,” Castro said. “There is a really high level of acceptance of living a single lifestyle and being casual in your relationships.”
There are now more single Americans by percentage than at any time in history, and Castro thought about juxtaposing a journey into a relationship with a journey into the single life. A Stephanie Coontz book, Marriage History, argues that society is experiencing a “dating industrial revolution.” Castro, who read the book, decided to depict a slice of that revolution on the stage, albeit under a slightly more politically incorrect title.
Changes in the Mating Strategies of White People, written by Castro and directed by Nebraska native Craig Anton, is set in contemporary Los Angeles and explores urban dating, technology and love. The play begins when two couples rendezvous in a coffee shop with radically different intentions: one has decided to meet in person after fostering an online relationship, and one has met to divorce after years of marriage.
“I had been spending a ton of time in coffee shops with people who have a social life there — [coffee shops] really are little communities,”Castro said. “I would go to Pete’s in my neighborhood and I would overhear Internet dates … I think these coffee shops create these subcultures and tiny villages in which people interact.”
The play carries a universal message that is sure to appeal to a variety of audiences and effectively contrast the single lifestyle with what it’s like to be in a relationship.
“For the purposes of the characters, both have the desire to attach and the desire to be independent — it’s really about the tension between being attached and being free or on your own,” Castro said. “I was writing about people in their thirties living this way, but everyone identifies with it — it’s so universal because people from all age brackets are going through the exact same thing.”
For Anton, that juxtaposition between dueling desires and human relationships is every director’s dream.
“What drew me to it, being an actor as well, it has the game involved within the relationships and within the dialogue. There is unlimited fun to be had with that,” Anton said. “I’m referring to the game in terms of relationships — as an actor, we always have to remember that it is never about the words spoken — it is always about the relationship and what’s underneath the words.”
The constant search for a lasting bond forms the backbone of the play. “There are certain attachments that are hard to break, even if you tried,” Castro said. “Humans naturally want to attach to other humans.”
Given the potential of the script to lend itself to uproarious comedy, Anton decided to lead the play in the direction of depth, rather than slapstick.
“It’s a smart, clever, well-written play, and I think a lot of it can be played with schticky comedy,” Anton said. “We discussed it quite a bit in these key roles. We knew people who were really funny and could bat it out of the park, but we didn’t know if the depth was there.”
The play promises to leave viewers asking questions about the role technology plays as a mediator in human connection, and whether or not that role is beneficial.
“I want people to ask questions and talk,” Castro said. “Relationships are hard enough without this technology that people hide behind because they can.”
Anton agrees.
“We are constantly moving forward — results continue to unfold, and in the dynamic of relationships, especially today in our fast-paced society and the digital age we are living in, changes occur much more quickly,” he said. “The play is a good pause to remind us of our value system.”
Castro’s message is one worth listening to. Changes in the Mating Strategies of White People opens Jan. 18 at The Lounge 2 in Santa Monica, and runs through Feb. 24. Tickets are available online at plays411.com.

I only knew Jon Walters for a relatively short period of time. In the roughly six months that I knew him, however, he made an impact that will stick with me for the rest of my life.
Before Jon arrived at school, I had already heard a lot about him. His juggernaut Mater Dei team almost never lost and people were already calling him a future Olympian. I was certainly not expecting the type of kid I would end up meeting, because none of his accolades in the pool hold a candle to what he accomplished out of it.
The very first thing I remember about Jon was just how much he talked to and got along with most of the team almost immediately. Usually it takes a little while to really get integrated into the team, but he was just so easy to get along with. Jon was always trying to make people laugh or cheer people up.
In my life, Jon is by far the most universally loved person I have ever met. I never once heard anybody say a negative word about him. It did not matter if you were the best player on the team or the last player on the roster, Jon just wanted to have fun with everyone. That aspect is what, to me, made him the most special, his ability to love and have fun with everyone he was around. All the best times I had last semester I shared with Jon; and I feel extremely lucky to have done so. I do not think I would be wrong in saying that every single person who was lucky enough to have had even one encounter with Jon became so much better for it. Jon’s liveliness was contagious and it constantly rubbed off on those around him.
This season was not the easiest for Jon, he was in the training room constantly dealing with injuries, but we all knew how important he could be to us. Jon was able to play in our conference tournament, which we needed to win, and he was instantly an impact player for us. We played University of Pacific in the semifinals, the same team we would play in the NCAA Finals a week later, and Jon was a beast. An image that will stick with me forever from this season is of Jon scoring a goal early in the game, then looking back at the goalie and yelling while our bench was going crazy. The ref gave him a yellow card, but it set the tone for the rest of the game and we never looked back. Jon truly was a pleasure to watch play water polo. He always wanted to learn and he almost never repeated his mistakes. He was simply dominant for us, even though he was not at 100 percent this year. He looked like a fifth-year senior out there, certainly not like a true freshman playing in some of his first collegiate games.
It is hard for me to write so much about someone who was taken from us way too soon, but it is important that everyone knows what kind of person Jon was. It is cliché to say, but I know Jon would want us to show him love by celebrating his life and remembering all the great times we had with him.
Last weekend I was able to attend a paddle out for Jon in Newport Beach. There were roughly 200 people in the water and there were hundreds more on the pier. It was an extremely powerful event and it really spoke to just how many people were personally affected by Jon.
This next semester will be tough, but whenever things get hard just remember what Jon was all about. In the end, USC lost one of its finest Trojans, but even though he was here for only a short time he made life-changing impacts on countless people, including myself. Jon Walters will be loved and missed by all who met him. He will be forever in our hearts. Legends never die. Fight on for Jon Walters.

Before the fall of my senior year of high school, I had never heard of the University of Southern California. I know it seems like an exaggeration that I could not have heard of this world-renowned school, but growing up thousands of miles away in Chicago didn’t stop me from eventually discovering the Trojan family. Luckily for me, a USC recruiter came to my high school and introduced me to the university’s strong academics and vibrant social life. The rest is history.
Irene Wang | Daily Trojan
 
Yet several high school seniors around Los Angeles are missing out each year on the experience of regularly meeting with these recruiters. According to the Los Angeles Times, many students attending public high schools in economically disadvantaged areas in and around Los Angeles are not given the opportunity to converse with recruiters from top-tier colleges.
Students in affluent neighborhoods are consistently bombarded with visits from college representatives at their high schools. In the last year, students at La Cañada High School in nearby La Cañada Flintridge received visits from 127 college recruiters, compared to the eight recruiters who came and talked to prospective college students at Jefferson High School in South Los Angeles.
The lack of face-to-face interaction between recruiters and these students attending schools in low-income neighborhoods could have adverse effects on their college search. Without recruiters there to introduce students to the possibilities of their particular schools, some students will never be able to learn all of their options. Moreover, students without support from parents who didn’t personally go through the college search makes the financial aid and application process all the more complicated. According to a study by the U.S. Department of Education, fewer than half of students whose parents did not go to college enroll in college, compared to 85 percent of students whose parents attended college. Because first-generation and low-income students are less likely to attend college, they are the group of students who specifically  need more visits from college recruiters.
The discrepancy is alarming. According to the LA Times, college recruiters are compelled to visit high schools where a large number of students traditionally apply and eventually enroll in their college. Some recruiters also said that the students’ ability to pay tuition without the need for significant financial aid factors into deciding whether to visit a high school or not.
This process seems to deaden the purpose of a college recruiter.
The role of a college recruiter is to identify eligible students and convince them to apply to his or her respective university. No one expects recruiters to hold students’ hands during the process. But college recruiters are vital in showing certain students the possibilities for their college careers. For that very reason, recruiters come to high schools and essentially introduce the school and its information to the students.
Students who attend schools that do not get much foot traffic from college recruiters are not privy to this experience. Furthermore, it is not only advantageous for the prospective students, but the recruiter as well when recruiters visit high school campuses. It is an opportunity for them to sway top students from that school and identify talent for the future, and also gives them the chance to showcase the universities’ highlights and achievements to a new audience.
Though college recruiters have both time and financial restraints to consider when traveling to dozens of schools in such a short period of time, the top priority should be to find those students who have yet to learn about their university.
Interaction between college recruiters and prospective college students is critical. It was crucial to me during my nail-biting senior year, and has been for thousands of students across the country. Particularly with low-income or would-be first-generation college students who do not have many outlets to make contact with college representatives, the free and convenient interaction that is possible through recruiters’ visits should be a primary concern for universities. Plus, it only takes one visit, a PowerPoint and a push of encouragement to introduce someone to his or her future.

Yes and no. “Write off” entirely? No. But the recruiters have limited time and colleges have a limited student recruitment budget. Accordingly, colleges want to spend their resources where there is a reasonable return of qualified students. Sadly, the high schools in the poor neighborhoods yield very few students qualified for the better colleges. And many students who are doubtful or marginal but recruited for diversity reasons soon flunk out. So yes, colleges should make an attempt to find qualified students at poor high schools, but given the yield, this source will never be a valuable place to find top students and will thus never get much college recruiting attention.
Don Harmon, So the solution is to continue to give up on poor students just because they went to schools that didn’t prepare them? You’re defending a system where the kids who already receive the most are rewarded for having a head start, and those who start behind are continuously punished for being poor. Obviously that’s the status quo, but that doesn’t make it any less messed up.
You should also get some facts before you spew your self-serving nonsense. “Undermatching”, the process of poor students attending schools below their academic qualification is one of the leading drivers of high dropout rates among low-income students. When these students attend schools like USC they graduate at much higher rates than they would from non-elite schools because institutions like ours have the resources to provide financial aid, counseling, and have graduation rates above 90%.  http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2013/03/undermatching_half_of_the_smartest_kids_from_low_income_households_don_t.html
Good piece Jordyn.
Christian, you are soooo wrong. You’re insinuating that affirmative action is the right thing to do. If you read Malcolm Gladwell’s most recent book, “David & Goliath,” he talks about how law schools are the worst when it comes to implementing affirmative action, and that black students admitted through it almost always graduate bottom of their class, at law schools that are at least one tier above what they really should’ve got into. Moreover, Gladwell is half black and isn’t an uncle Tom. Plus, he talks about the “big fish in a small pond” dynamic. Read the book; I’m not gonna expound on it. You need to enlighten yourself, and see both sides of the argument, before you spew your one-sided liberal agenda. 
Succinctly put, you need to drive yourself to where you want to get in life. Government/social intervention hurts more than helps. I stand with Don.
1. I’ve read the book
2. Just because one Black person agrees with you doesn’t mean you’re not racist.
3. I don’t think I’ve ever read a less nuanced post, which is shocking considering this is the internet. Jordyn is defending programs where poor students apply to and attend schools they have the grades to get into. You’re indicting the idea that Black kids should be let into elite schools when they don’t meet the general academic profile of the institution. Its pretty evident that we’re talking about different things. In fact, I am fairly certain that we’re talking about things that are the exact opposite of one another. But even if we weren’t, the folly of putting kids  into failing schools, incarcerating their parents, leaving them in food insecure households, and then putting them into universities without providing any kind of support system should be evident. This is clearly an institutional problem, not a “poor black people don’t deserve opportunity problem”
4. You literally just said “Malcom Gladwell made a really great argument but I”m too inarticulate to explain it”, so I’m just going to make sweeping claims about liberalism without any justification or rational.” Sweet bro.
Also…pretty sure private universities like USC don’t carry out government intervention. At least it would be very difficult for them do so because they aren’t the government. You’re like those Tea Party Patriots who want the government to keep their hands off of their Medicare. 
You my friend, should read a book…preferably not a Malcom Gladwell one because those obviously aren’t helping you.

The USC Shoah Foundation has begun the process of restoring the 5 percent of 235,005 tapes in its Visual History Archive that were previously considered unsalvageable.
History · Panelist Stephen Smith discusses the value of learning from the stories of Holocaust survivors in the Doheny Memorial Library during last year’s discussion on the continued relevance of the Holocaust. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The tapes were part of the Institute’s Preservation Project, an endeavor to convert its 52,000 Holocaust survivor testimonies into familiar and conservable digital formats. The process took four years and was finished in June 2012.
According to Ryan Fenton-Strauss, video archive and post-production manager for the Shoah Foundation Institute, this process of mass digitization involved robotic technology and a quality assurance process in which any video with a production issue — either video or audio — was flagged for further assistance.
The Institute then began the Restoration Project, through which the Shoah Foundation’s Information Technology Services staff aims to restore the nearly 12,000 tapes that require further work. Many of the tapes were fixable via commercial hardware and software, but others required a more complex solution.
Fenton-Strauss said that after a frustrating period of time in which he and his coworkers found themselves getting nowhere with the damaged tapes, he wondered how the commercial hardware and software was correcting the other thousands of tapes.
“If we could break down the video into images, we could drop the ‘bad’ images and replace them with the good parts of the images,” Fenton-Strauss said.
With the help of ITS intern Sindhu Jagadeesh and the Google Picasa tool, Fenton-Strauss was able to write software that deciphered the good images from the bad and inserted the missing images.
The Picasa tool, however, proved to be limited in its recognition abilities, and a more powerful tool was necessary to continue with the project. Fenton-Strauss’s intern Ivan Alberto Trujillo Priego suggested a stronger image recognition software, known as National Instruments’ Vision Builder, which has thus far worked for the ITS team.
“In one video, the survivor’s face was completely gone, and we were able to bring back an image in black and white,” Fenton-Strauss said.
Many believe the Preservation and Restoration Projects are a vital part of keeping the memories of Holocaust survivors alive.
Kimberly Goldstein, a sophomore majoring in occupational therapy and psychology, stressed the significance of honoring the memories of Holocaust victims.
“It’s important to preserve what these survivors have to say so that we can keep teaching younger generations about this,” Goldstein said. “We need to make sure that it never happens again.”
The efforts of Fenton-Strauss and the Shoah Foundation Institute are important not only for learning purposes, but also for those whose families were directly affected by the Holocaust and wish to keep their relatives’ memories alive.
Daniel Silvermintz, a sophomore majoring in international relations global business and the president of Chabad @ USC, would not have been able to see his grandfather’s testimony had the Shoah Foundation not digitized the videos.
“My grandfather survived the Holocaust; he passed away last year during my first week of college. I had never seen his testimonial, but I knew that he had done one,” Silvermintz said. “I knew that when I came to ’SC, I would be able to see it. So I went to the library, and I was able to watch his testimonial video.”
Silvermintz believes the firsthand accounts of these survivors will allow their memories to carry on long past their own lives.
“As time goes on, as the generation that survived the Holocaust passes away, it’s going to be much, much harder to have those firsthand accounts and feel a real connection and understand the magnitude of the tragedy that really happened,” he said. “So, having these video records from people who witnessed it firsthand allows people to connect on a personal record and empathize.”
The ITS team is nearly halfway done with the Restoration Project and is set to finish in July of 2014.

Shuttle service from USC to L.A. Live will be reinstated starting Jan. 17.
The shuttle will depart from the Galen Center from 6:30 p.m. to 2:00 a.m. every half hour on Fridays and Saturdays. The departure times from L.A. Live have not been scheduled yet.
Next stop · USG and USC Transportation will revive a shuttle service for USC students between the Galen Center and L.A. Live beginning on Jan. 17. The shuttle will run Friday and Saturday from 6:30 p.m to 2 a.m. – Daily Trojan file photo
Andrew Menard, USG director of University Affairs, oversaw the shuttle’s implementation. The idea of the L.A. Live tram was based on experiences during his freshman year.
“I used to go to L.A. Live a lot with my girlfriend,” Menard said. “Movies, great food, hockey games — L.A. Live is the center of everything.”
Michelle Garcia, associate director of Transit at USC Transportation, noted that USC used to run a similar service, but stopped in 2012 due to a decline in student participation and the implementation of the Expo line.
Garcia said, however, that the Expo line didn’t prove to be a solution.
“The reality is that even after Expo opened, students weren’t taking it to L.A. Live,” Garcia said. “So we went back to AEG and asked if they would be interested in starting it again.”
Garcia said AEG is sponsoring half the shuttle and USC Transportation is sponsoring the other half.
The USC Transportation office has discussed offering promotions exclusively to USC students who use the L.A. Live tram with AEG.
“We have spoken with AEG about the possibility of monitoring passenger counts as weeks go by and other shuttle-specific promotions, like something you get when you get on the bus,” Garcia said. “But that’s definitely for the future and not planned in the upcoming first weeks.”
Regal Cinema is offering a special promotion the first day the shuttle runs. All USC students can receive a free popcorn by showing their ID, regardless of whether they used the tram or not.
Additionally, according to the L.A. Live website, students who present their ID to participating establishments will receive up to 20 percent off their bills.
Student reaction seemed positive toward the new shuttle service.
“I think it’s a great idea that they are bringing the tram back. It gives students an opportunity to explore [the] area around the school,” said Layla Memar, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I would be more comfortable using the tram rather than the metro since the tram is associated with USC and the metro can be a little sketchy late at night.”
Elena Legan, a sophomore majoring in biology, said the shuttle will be a great convenience for those without a car.
“I am really excited about the L.A. Live shuttle. I love going down there, but it’s difficult if you don’t have a car and if you don’t want to take the metro at night,” Legan said. “It provides students an opportunity to do something on the weekends off campus, which is awesome.”
Some students, however, wished the service extended to weekdays as well.
Ricky Xin, a freshman majoring in business, hoped to take advantage of the shuttle on Tuesdays, when the movies at L.A. Live cost $7.
”Yeah definitely, this is a good news,” Xin said. “But it’s better to prolong the time to weekdays. I’m sure more students will benefit from [that extension] since I’m not the only one who usually goes on Tuesday.”
Xin isn’t the only student who was interested in going to L.A. Live for the theater. Movies serve as a popular pull for students’ attendance at L.A. Live.
“I’d be much more likely to go see a move at L.A. Live due to the accessibility of the tram,” Lexi Zoraian, a sophomore majoring in human biology, said. “And because it’s free I would go more often than if I had to pay to take the Metro.”
Menard showed interest in expanding the shuttle to other days.
“This is only a temporary schedule,” she said. “I’d like to make the time into weekdays.”
Garcia expressed confidence in student demand for the shuttle.
“If it comes out that students don’t use the shuttle we would retire it again,” Garcia said. “But since it has stopped running we have consistently gotten questions about the shuttle and requests for it to come back.”

USC Viterbi School of Engineering’s Distance Education Network was ranked first by U.S. News and World Report for the second year in a row. The program provides students the opportunity to continue their education and earn their degree completely online.

Shushil Patel, a second-year graduate student majoring in systems architecture and engineering, said he is able to balance his full time job with his academics due to DEN@Viterbi’s flexibility.
“There are two kinds of flexibility that we all need,” said Gaurav Sukhatme, professor and department chair of computer science at the Viterbi School. “We need flexibility in space and we need flexibility in time.”
According to Iraj Ershaghi, professor and director of petroleum engineering, the degree offers both.
“The beauty is that it’s almost like a portable degree,” Ershaghi said.
A portable degree was exactly what Reza B’Far, a fourth-year distance graduate student in computer science, was seeking.
“I had been enrolled in graduate programs before,” B’Far said. “But because I was involved in graduate programs on-site and my job was moving me around, I had to discontinue the programs.”
DEN@Viterbi allowed B’Far to remain enrolled in a single graduate program even when his job required him to relocate.
Currently, DEN@Viterbi students can pursue more than  40 master’s degree programs, graduate certificates and non-credit professional courses, all online. According to professors, what makes DEN@Viterbi unique from other offerings is the program’s dedication to offering flexibility without compromising academic quality.
All DEN classes are “blended,” meaning that on-campus and off-campus students are all engaged in the same classrooms.
“We were a hybrid before the word hybrid was invented,” Vice Dean for Academic Programs James Moore said.
Classes take place in Viterbi’s 13 state-of-the-art DEN studios. Each studio is equipped to stream high-quality webcasts of each lecture live, as well as record high-definition videos that are posted online and can be reviewed by both off-campus and on-campus students.
“The big benefit of being in a DEN class is that any notes that the professor takes are digitally recorded online. If a professor writes on the chalkboard during a normal lecture and I miss it, it’s gone forever,” said Kevin Xu, a first-year graduate student majoring in biomedical engineering.
The DEN system holds distance students to the same standards as traditional on-campus students. The admissions and class requirements are the same.
“There’s a lot of teamwork in some of these classes, so you still have face-to-face interaction through virtual collaboration software,” Patel said.
DEN resources are not just shared among USC students. DEN@Viterbi also uses its technological infrastructure to collaborate with other professionals around the world. In addition to Viterbi, USC offers online graduate programs through nine of its other schools.
“It has really expanded the way we can share resources among companies and universities,” Ershaghi said.

Spiritual teacher, author and lecturer Marianne Williamson is running for Congress in California’s 33rd District.
Campaign trail · Congressional Candidate Marianne Williamson speaks and answers questions to potential voters while campaigning. – Photo courtesy of Ileana Wachtel
Williamson is running as an independent, a stance she believes is necessary to change the national political dialogue. She faces the incumbent democratic candidate Henry Waxman who has represented the general district for more than thirty years.
Politics is a new field for Williamson. Though some might believe there is a gap between the spiritual and political worlds, Williamson disagrees and has based her campaign on the same principles.
“I think the fact that people do see politics as separate from our lives is part of the problem in America,” Williamson said. “The fact that politics has become a spectator sport and that there’s only a certain group that is deemed ‘political types’ is dangerous.”
Williamson began her career as a lecturer. The best-selling author is taking ideals of self-transformation and using them to tackle issues such as food corruption due to high-fructose corn syrup and processed foods, climate change and the United States’ reliance on fossil fuels.
She also hopes to close the gap between the “haves” and the “have-nots.”
Williamson believes that the tools individuals use to change their lives can be applied to larger groups — such as the United States. Her campaign hopes to bring attention to a dialogue that is rarely heard in full.
In 1997, Williamson published The Healing of America, which discussed a holistic perspective on the United States’ political system. She encourages citizens to “reclaim their spiritual voices” in all aspects of their lives, especially politics.
Similar principles outlined in the book are the ones upon which Williamson said she will challenge Waxman. Williamson plans to decline all funds provided by special interest groups and instead focus on the issues of the people.
“To me, politics should be a container for a deep national conversation,” Williamson said. “Whereas at present, politics is the purveyor of the most shallow conversation possible, and looking to the political status quo to change this seems absurd given that the political status quo brought us to where we are.”
David Moreno, a sophomore majoring in international relations and political science, sees the spiritual aspect of politics to be a competitive edge for Williamson.
“To be honest and successful in politics requires individuals to shut out the interest groups and listen to what’s right by the people — and themselves. I think it’s unique to say it aloud, but not a new idea.”
Williamson hopes to promise graduates the ability to create their own jobs, careers and fields.
Referencing Oregon as an example of an educational system that provides free higher education, she is working to get funding out of politics and into educational opportunities.
“Higher education is becoming more and more a luxury of a small group who can afford it. This is as un-American -— as undemocratic — as you can get,” she said.
Students on campus recognized the power of scholarship and the need for a university education.
“Although it may seem more as a luxury due to college sports, location and connections, higher education is still expected for students and will continue to be that in the future,” said Ashley Warner, a senior majoring in communication.
Kevin Keer, a sophomore majoring in computer science and physics, disagreed.
“Many universities such as USC have programs that help underprivileged students achieve the goal of reaching college. Cost is normally a deterrent from certain schools but sometimes it attracts other students to some other schools.”
Williamson provided the following advice for students seeking success.
“I think that if [the government] does right by [students] that when you get out of college, you can create your own six-million dollar company if you want to. [the United States should] give you the tools and then watch you run.”

On Jan. 12, Queer and Ally Student Assembly hosted their spring barbecue in Alumni Park.
Catered Hawaiian barbecue awaited attendees on brightly colored tablecloths. The atmosphere was a fun and vibrant one, due to the music that blared loudly from speakers.

Alec White, a sophomore majoring in political science and a QuASA member, spearheaded the spring barbecue.
“QuASA is a great organization, especially for those who are not out yet. We put on events to show our support — to show that they aren’t the only ones who feel a certain way about themselves,” White said.
White’s involvement with QuASA is unique as he identifies as straight in an organization of predominantly queer and gay students.
“QuASA is here because it’s everyone. It reaches so many different kinds of identities, whether you are queer or straight. Maybe you are Latino or Jewish — we get everyone,” said Becca Grumet, executive director of QuASA.
Grumet described how her role in such an active student group on campus serves as her main inspiration.
“I love giving people what they want. Once, QuASA brought a couple of famous YouTube bloggers to campus,” Grumet said. “Seeing students shaking when meeting the stars they are obsessed with was so cool. It sounds cheesy, but it’s that feeling of making people’s dreams come true.”
According to Grumet, one of the events that are currently in the works for the semester are the Valentine’s Day Sex Carnival and a dodgeball event called Everybody’s Dodgeball.
Glenn Young, assistant director of QuASA, is looking forward to the Sex Carnival, in particular.
“The Sex Carnival is a fair that will promote safe sex and sexual awareness and awareness of different identities,” Young said. “We plan to bring in food trucks and though I don’t want to compare it to Springfest, we want to make it big like that.”
One of QuASA’s signature and most popular events is the Second Chance Prom, which will be held at The Lorenzo this year. In the past, the Second Chance Prom featured themes like “Zombies” and was held at the California Science Center.
Within the next two weeks, QuASA has planned a Rainbow Skate Night and a Welcome Back Dance.
One of the organizations under QuASA is OUTreach. Its service-oriented projects range from helping the homeless to working with LGBT senior citizens.
As QuASA and its member organizations move forward, Co-President Dawson Ray stressed improving the partnership between LGBT students and their allies.
“One thing that the USC community could do a better job of is joining the Ally Alliance group. As of right now, I feel like we have two members — the president and vice president,” Ray said. “It was started recently, but I feel like not a lot of people know about it, or those who know about it identify as queer or gay. Getting the word out about Ally Alliance would be great.”

University President C.L. Max Nikias announced Monday morning the establishment of the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience, made possible by a $50 million grant from Dr. Gary Michelson.

Michelson, a retired orthopedic spinal surgeon, has a storied career that includes a place in the National Inventors Hall of Fame and over 955 issued or pending patents to date.
After retiring from private practice, Michelson became heavily involved in philanthropy. He has donated millions of dollars to medical research, worked with programs to provide free textbooks to students and invested in the creation of no-kill adoption facilities for animals that would otherwise end up in city animal shelters.
Dr. Michelson’s donation makes possible the construction of a 190,000-square-foot building in the southwest corner of campus, which is currently home to the majority of USC’s science and engineering buildings.
The USC Michelson Center’s labs and offices will be home to 20 to 30 principal investigators, and it will employ hundreds of researchers and students. According to USC News, the center is complete with  “state-of-the-art flexible labs, a Center for Electron Microscopy and Analysis, a nanofabrication facility and a suite of microscopy imaging technology that can take precise measurements inside of cells.”
Faculty from both the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences will work together with interdisciplinary convergence at the USC Michelson Center.
The USC Michelson Center’s mission is based on applying the tremendous theoretical breakthroughs that have occurred in bioscience to the real world. By speeding up the process of diagnosing diseases to developing the latest technology in biomedical instruments, officials believe the USC Michelson Center will put USC at the forefront of biomedical research.
President Nikias spoke on the importance of the interdisciplinary research the USC Michelson Center is founded upon to the students and faculty that gathered for the announcement at Town and Gown.
“One of the most important parts of education is our dedication to interdisciplinary research,” he said. “At many other universities, ‘interdisciplinary’ is no more than a buzzword. USC turns colleges from diverse disciplines into creative collaboration.”
Steve Kay, dean of the Dornsife College, and Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School, joined President Nikias and Michelson in offering remarks at the event.
“The Michelson Center will attract and cultivate a lab interested in not ‘what now,’ but ‘what next,’” Kay said. “The human capital this building will attract … even overachievers will struggle to keep up.”
Kay also emphasized the mission of the USC Michelson Center in bringing science out of the laboratory and into the real world, saying the building will be made of “bricks and mortar — no ivory, no towers.”
Yortsos spoke on the role the USC Michelson Center will play in cementing a new avenue of biological science research in Southern California.
“The Michelson Center will make USC the global attraction, the beating heart of this excitement,” he said. “It will propel USC students and engineers to make all problems solvable and develop the next big innovations for USC, Los Angeles, the nation and the world.”
Students offered optimism and excitement about the opportunity to pursue their academic goals in a world-class institution like the USC Michelson Center.
Sina Torabi, a pre-med sophomore majoring in economics and minoring in natural sciences, echoed the optimism of Dean Yortsos for the potential of the USC Michelson Center.
“Pre-med students are ecstatic for the Michelson Center, since it presents even more opportunities for us to contribute in academia,” he said. “It would be great to get some hands-on experience working under a renowned professor and test some innovative new technology that would benefit patients.”
Michelson thanked the USC community for agreeing to host the Center, and spoke to the importance of research that makes an impact on the world, not research for sake of research.
“The [Michelson Center] will converge research to produce real world breakthroughs in real time. This is going to be a grand adventure, and we thank you.”
Editor’s Note: The headline was updated from “Alumnus donates $50 million” to “University receives $50 million” to reflect that Dr. Gary Michelson is not an alumnus of the university. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Based on the article above and an article by the LA Times isn’t Dr. Michelson not an alumni?

USC students are set to take part in the Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U) conference, an annual conference for college students that aims to promote leadership and solutions to global challenges.

The conference will be hosted by former President Bill Clinton at Arizona State University from March 21-23. The event is part of a wider mission of CGI U to “turn ideas into action.”
USC students have consistently participated in the conference in past years. Students must prepare an application to the conference, which includes a “Commitment to Action.”
“This commitment to action is a new specific and measurable initiative from either an individual student, or a group of students that will undertake in the months after the CGI U conference,” said Bill Wetzel, director of CGI U. “We try to bring in a lot of leading young change-makers who can tell their stories to the students in the room.”
The CGI U Conference includes approximately 1,100 students from more than 300 schools and universities around the world, Wetzel said.
Lychee Dai, a graduate student at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, attended CGI U in 2013. Her project focused on sharing knowledge through online media.
“My commitment involved launching an education app that allows people to share their educational knowledge,” Dai said. “If you are good at math, and I can speak another language, then we can be connected on the app. After being connected on the app initially, you can then learn from each other in person.”
At the conference, Dai won funding to fully develop her project.
Angela Zhou, a freshman in the World Bachelor in Business program, will attend CGI U this year.
Her Commitment to Action project aims to combat sex trafficking in East Asia as well as in other underdeveloped countries. She hopes to work with the International Princess Project, an organization dedicated to combating sex trafficking.
“As I learned more about it, I realized that sex trafficking is a really big problem in America and in other countries also,” Zhou said. “International Princess Project provides women who are rescued from sex trafficking brothels in India a vocation in sewing pajamas. It’s a really innovative way to combine fashion and social activism, which is something I’m interested in in the future.”
Zhou said she realized she wanted to help sex trafficking victims while in high school.
“I realized through volunteering with International Princess Project in high school that first of all, not many people knew what sex trafficking was, and second of all, not many people my age were volunteering,” Zhou said. “I decided I wanted to educate other students my age about sex trafficking, so I founded an organization called the Teen Ambassadors Program that aids sex trafficking prevention organizations.”
She hopes that her involvement in the CGI U conference will allow her to expand her efforts further.
“I haven’t really spread it beyond the Orange County area, but I am going to push for the growth of the organization and push for the growth of the Teen Ambassadors Program,” Zhou said. “I think it would be really beneficial to expand the organization past just the borders of India and into other East Asian countries as well.”
Tim Kline, a graduate student at the Marshall School of Business, will also attend CGI U. For his project, he worked with two students from the Art Center College of Design, Connie Bakshi and Rudy Rummel.
The project focuses on the creation of a children’s game called Tejo Conejo, based on popular Colombian traditions. Their goal is to allow disadvantaged women in Colombia to acquire technical skills and earn a livelihood in the manufacturing of this game.
“What we envision is that we’re setting up a micro-factory for the women that’ll have daycare for their kids, right in their communities. So all they have to do is walk down the street, and their children will be there with them,” Kline said. “They can spend as many hours or as few hours as they want.”
Kline explained that the group hopes to appeal to a wider market in Colombia.
“We think there will be a market in Bogota for a game that taps into traditional Colombian folklore but also is a social impact project that helps out families in the outskirts of Bogota.”
Kline has enjoyed reaching out to work with other schools.
“I think it’s so fulfilling to work with the designers. It’s important to have cross-functional teams to get things done,” Kline said. “Working with people who are most creative and have a different perspective has been very rewarding.”

On Jan. 11, “DVF: Journey of a Dress” opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). The exhibit, which has traveled throughout Asia, the Middle East and South America, celebrates 40 years of Diane von Furstenberg’s iconic wrap dress.
In the early 1970s, the Belgian-born designer rocked the fashion world by creating a drip-dry, cotton jersey dress that wrapped in the front and tied at the waist. Without zippers or hooks, the innovative design represented women’s changing societal roles. As increased numbers of women entered the workforce, DVF’s wrap dresses provided an ideal balance between stylishness and practicality.
As described in the exhibit’s informational brochure, “the wrap dress epitomized not only the spirit of women’s liberation but of sexual liberation, too: in two minutes flat, a woman could be dressed and out the door; in even less time, she could be undressed.”
The exhibit chronicles the evolution of the wrap dress and gives viewers insight into von Furstenberg’s fascinating personal history.
Upon entering the building, guests walk through a long hallway that serves as a timeline. Blown-up images of advertisements, magazine covers, and celebrities decorate the hot pink walls, highlighting key moments in the dress’ history. At the end of the timeline, a neon sign boldly asserts an overarching theme: “Feel like a woman, wear a dress!”
The main showroom features hundreds of mannequins clad in wrap dresses from throughout the decades, including pieces created exclusively for the fortieth anniversary celebration. Vivid prints, bold colors and sophisticated cuts define the brand’s aesthetic.
Mallory Kugler, a junior majoring in critical studies, appreciated the design’s timelessness.
“I think it’s interesting that when you look at the dresses up close, you can’t pin-point which ones are from earlier times and which ones are more recent. This really shows that she [DVF] nailed it from the beginning,” Kugler said.
Women of all different ages admired the displays and compared their favorite patterns, attesting to the dress’ universal appeal.
“DVF’s dresses are accessible to women of all ages. The cuts are so figure flattering and women of all shapes and sizes can wear them,” said Kugler’s mother, Robin.
In addition to the dress gallery, an art salon pays tribute to the designer herself. Many of the works on display were gifts given to DVF by her friends, current and former. Included are portraits by influential artists such as Andy Warhol, Chuck Close, Helmut Newton and Annie Leibovitz, among others.
The pieces portray Von Furstenberg as a strong, beautiful woman with a personality just as vibrant as her signature prints.
“When she [DVF] started her career, she didn’t think that all of her friends would become famous. This whole section of the exhibit is dedicated to the relationships she had with them,” explained Annette Kafati, a student studying product development at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising.
Von Furstenberg also commissioned Dustin Yellin to make a life-size sculpture of the wrap dress, entitled “A Ghost May Come.” To create the breathtaking piece, Yellin embedded tiny newspaper and magazine cutouts in more than 4,800 pounds of layered glass.
As guests explore the exhibit, they are encouraged to post snapshots of their favorite moments on Instagram and Twitter, using the hashtags #wrap40 and #journeyofadress. They can get their photos printed in the gift shop, which also offers some pieces from DVF’s special anniversary collection.
Warhol’s iconography inspired the limited-edition collection called “Popwrap.” Von Furstenberg combined the artist’s famous emblems–the flower and the dollar sign–with some of her best-known patterns. The end-result is garments that are both playful and polished, encapsulating the spirit of two individuals who pioneered their respective fields.
“Journey of a Dress,” runs until April 1 at the Wilshire May Co. Building, 6767 Wilshire Blvd. 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday, Tuesday and Thursday;11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Friday; 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. Admission is free.

Jensen Karp is the co-owner and co-curator of Gallery 1988, a Melrose-based, pop culture-themed art gallery, currently in its 10th operative year. He and Katie Cromwell, both USC graduates, opened the gallery to offer affordable, pop culture-inspired art from lesser-known artists.

Gallery 1988 is a far cry from the fine art world, but that’s exactly what Karp and Cromwell wanted. In fact, it is the fine art world’s pretentiousness and stuffiness that fueled Gallery 1988’s creation.
“I don’t ever want to be accepted by that blue chip kind of pompous world,” Karp said. “We always thought it was funny that anyone could sit there and be like, ‘Art is in the eye of the beholder’ when they’re trying to sell yellow dots on a canvas for $40,000, but when we want to have a piece on pop culture, it’s not art. It’s very selective. I laugh as much at the stuff that they sell as they laugh at us trying to say that we’re art.”
Insert Dan Goodsell, a pop-art artist who has created an entire world surrounding his lead character, Mr. Toast, and his many friends: Shaky Bacon, Joe the Egg, Mope the Onion and LemonHead, among many others.
Goodsell currently has an exhibition, “Shaky Bacon Strikes Back,” on view at Gallery 1988 located at 7021 Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90038. It is his second solo show with the gallery — the first was “Drawing Mr. Toast” — and Goodsell has participated in a number of its multi-artist exhibitions.
The new exhibition features about 420 original pieces, although the artist is in the process of bumping it up to about 500. The tone? Quirky and eccentric. The style? A playful, comic book look. In addition to drawings, Goodsell also makes comic books and plush toys, which he exhibited at last year’s Festival of Books.
“I like going from very sweet and fun to darkly humorous at times,” Goodsell said. “So you get this sort of nice range which is the range of my personal humor. I love things that are a little saccharine, but I also love to go dark and mess with the characters a little bit.”
Some examples: A VHS tape and a dodo with the words “two of a kind” written underneath, suggesting the impending extinction of VHS; Joe the Egg dressed as Louis CK stands next to Shaky Bacon dressed as Annie; Lemonhead exclaims “Second Rule of Fight Club: YOU DO NOT TALK ABOUT FIGHT CLUB.”
Goodsell’s favorite art piece is Shaky Bacon riding a turkey with “For Columbus” written underneath. Karp’s favorite is Mr. Toast dressed as a Clippers fan. You get the idea.
According to Goodsell, there’s not necessarily any overall theme or message to his work. Rather, this particular exhibition is based on a number of things that inspire him, things that he likes or finds amusing. Media is one such influence.
“Initially, for the show, I was going to try and do all movie, TV and media related, kind of do my character interpretations of all of that,” Goodsell said. “At a certain point, I realized I didn’t want the show to be that myopic, so I just opened it up more. I think I’ve tried to have that as sort of a general, secondary focus. I’m not ruled by it, but it’s definitely sort of a trend that I’m exploring with the show.”
Most amazingly, smaller drawings sell for $30 a pop. Bigger pieces such as “Happy Death Star” are more expensive at $125. Still, the art runs quite a few thousand less than those yellow dots Karp mentioned earlier. Goodsell’s shows are cash and carry, meaning you can walk in and buy a piece straight off the wall and take it home with you that day. His shows are the only cash and carry shows at Gallery 1988.
“Shaky Bacon” is also interactive. Goodsell will be doing live drawings at the gallery on Thursdays (12-2 p.m.) and Sundays (1-3 p.m.) during the exhibition. In that time, someone could simply watch him draw, or commission a work. With commissions, Goodsell appreciates the collaborative process, though he says any work of his will be filtered through his artistic sensibilities.
“As an artist, I do my art for myself, initially,” Goodsell said. “That it can find an audience is incredible, but it’s not like an illustrator who is there at the behest of the people. I think it’s more fun to work with someone to find sort of that middle point between their interests and my interests. Everybody seems to really enjoy it and it’s always kind of a wonderful thing when you see the look on their face and they say, ‘Man, this is everything I hoped it would be.’”
On the curating side of things, Goodsell has the full support of the gallery.
“Katie and I are never here to question it and ask if it’s going to sell,” Karp said. “That’s sort of secondary. We believe in that artist, so we let them pursue their vision.”
Perhaps that’s why Karp is so open to future shows with Goodsell.
“We always want to keep him in the loop,” Jensen said. “These shows are really fun. I wouldn’t be against doing one of these every year.”
 
“Shaky Bacon Strikes Back” will be on display at Gallery 1988 through January 25th.

In a universe where India conquers the West Coast of the United States, Bollywood becomes the top film industry in the world. Following these circumstances, USC transforms into the University of New India and boasts one of the top film schools in the world: the UNI School of Bollywood Arts.
This extravagant world is part of the upcoming USC student film project titled “The UNI School of Bollywood Arts.” Initially, the idea sprouted from the creative minds of talented freshmen from the USC School of Cinematic Arts. Together, they created a story of an alternate universe in which Napoleon Bonaparte spent his exile in India, raised a new family and trained a new line of French-Indian leaders who conquered the West Coast of the United States, creating New India. In only thirty minutes, this film tells a tale of friendship, Bollywood-inspired songs and dance and even a love story.
Much like the grandiose challenge of fitting this impressive story into just 30 minutes, the team behind the film is quite large. Within the large creative group of three dozen students, two aspiring film students emerged to “take the reins,” propelling this small collaboration into a massive trans-media project. Sarah Jones, the film’s producer, and Ben Kadie, the film’s director, share the details of how the film came to fruition.
Kadie has been doing short films since third grade with his dad. Even though he and Jones had “little influence on the last draft of the script,” both oversaw the filming and filled in the gaps to make the film happen. The project allowed for each student to passionately work in his or her specialized field without the burden of competition.
An unofficial competition in the cinema school inspired the idea for the film. Even though the intention of the game was to promote creativity among the SCA students, not every student appreciated the rivalry between fellow classmates in their first semester.
“The game placed all of the SCA students against each other,” Kadie said. “In the end, the competition hurt a couple of feelings. [But] this collaborative group project was a really good chance to work together.”
Bollywood became the theme after students suggested the idea in a group meeting. Working together also encouraged networking among the SCA students, which would later lead to the success of their fundraising campaign.  Initially, their project lacked funding but they solved this issue by creating an Indiegogo fundraising campaign and used every social media resource available to make their project a reality.
The group assimilated an extraordinary variety of people despite their limited resources. They posted casting calls around USC and held auditions to cast actors while friendships led other talented individuals toward this project.
“It’s very helpful going about the cinema school because we can use this experience for other projects,” Jones said. “We found everyone who’s involved in the project through Facebook or prior connections.”
As more students began to join in on the project, coordination became much more difficult.
“The whole thing started out slowly because so many people were working on this film,” Jones said. “The script itself took about a month and we are still editing the footage.” Indeed, the group was so large at one point that productivity was stagnant until a couple of students took responsibility and filled those leadership roles.
Jones majors in television and film production at the USC School of Cinematic Arts and took on the important role of producer to keep the process efficient.
“In Minnesota, not a lot of people did film so I was really inspired to do something big here amongst other film majors,” Jones said.
“The most difficult part was the filming process. We had only two weekends to film and it’s a half-hour long movie,” Kadie said.
With a student group as large as this one, as well as operating on a tight schedule, the goal of shooting the film in only two-and-a-half school weekends was very ambitious.
“Overall, the dance turned out quite well and it was pretty magical to see,” Kadie said. “I wasn’t there when they were learning the dances but an hour later I would come back to the actors and they would be able to dance the whole routine.”
“It’s more of a tribute than an actual Bollywood film,” Jones said. “But its purpose is for audiences to enjoy the energy of this musical.” Kadie agreed, remarking that the film will get people to go out and watch authentic Bollywood films. Since the whole project was inspired by real-life events experienced by the crew, many SCA students in the audience will enjoy the many references in the film. Each person on the team, especially the actors and writers, inspired the characters found in the film.
Surprisingly, the parts of the film most coveted by the Kadie and Jones were spontaneous and not scripted.
“There’s one song called ‘Life on the Set’ which is a song between the two competing student teams, and it’s a fun goofy song where the actors brought a lot of little jokes on set that weren’t scripted,” chuckled Kadie.
“It’s interesting to see how the music composer, Michael Schlafman, wrote amazing music in such a short time. We didn’t give the composer or choreographer a lot of time but they finished within hours. It was rewarding to see everyone’s different abilities,” Jones said.
Initially, their project lacked funding but they solved this issue by creating a fundraising campaign and used every social media resource available to make their project a reality.
Even though the Indiegogo campaign has long passed, Trojans can still support this student project by attending a film screening later this semester. These students are so committed that they created a “series bible” that can be accessed online. Don’t miss out on the most exciting, and possibly the biggest, student project yet!

Lael Feldman, who goes by her stage name Lael Summer, a senior in the Thornton’s Popular Music Program, is living the dream. In 2012, Summer signed to the True Groove Records label. She worked closely with producer Tomás Doncker to release Burden to Bear. This debut album, under the True Groove Global SOUL Independent Music Label, features Summer’s original, expressive songs as well as her cover of Hall and Oates’ “Do What You Want, Be What You Are.”

Born in New York City, Summer cites her urban upbringing as essential to the development of her complex and mature character. Despite her roots, she also clearly enjoys what Los Angeles has to offer to a young artist.
“There is nothing quite like the feeling of being unbelievably lost and alone while surrounded by millions of people- — you grow up fast,” Summer said. “It just so happens [my] two home bases are where it’s at in the industry and [I] get to experience the best from coast to coast.”
Despite her bubbly appearance, Summer’s voice is a powerful and soulful mix that accurately captures feelings of both pain and hope. In addition, her bluesy rhythms never stray too far from the accessibility of pop music. This masterful blend of genres stems from the the large role that music has played in Summer’s life.
“Music has always played a significant role in my life,” Summer said. “It is a huge facet of my identity, an outlet for my emotions.”
By age 10, Summer had shifted from musicals to more emotionally rich music. Though her voice has clearly matured since those days, Summer still maintains the same vulnerability and emotional rawness.
Summer also wants to dispel the myth that pop music is less rigorous than other genres.
“People hear ‘pop music’ and think bubblegum and autotune,” Summer said. “But we, too, are in a top conservatory studying a lot of the same things as [students] do in the classical and jazz departments.”
USC’s Popular Music Program was the perfect breeding ground for Summer’s development as a musician. She describes singing songs by classic acts such as The Beatles, Chaka Khan and Garbage.
“Performance class was so much fun, a lot of work, but it introduced me to all genres from early rock to funk, Motown and contemporary music,” Summer said. “It taught me how to work within a band, hear harmonies and understand every instrument and its purpose. It gave me experience performing and taught me how to learn new material super rapidly — a very valuable skill.”
The Pop Music Program is also known for its small class size — around 25 students per class —and the hands-on experience it provides.
With so much talent in one program, Summer sometimes finds it difficult not to compare herself to other talented students. The musician stays grounded by focusing on her art and making sure that her music truly expresses her emotions.
Summer’s lifestyle might seem stressful, but the artist advocates managing one’s time well. She also has the support of her family and friends who remind her to live a well-balanced life.
“Time management is crucial; when things get super stressful, I plan out my days down to 15-minute intervals and make sure to include time for breaks and for food,” Summer said. “They keep me in check.”
Summer is currently working on her first music video, collaborating with fellow USC students David Bolen, Janey Feingold and Audrey Rosenberg. With all her success, Summer tries to stay level-headed.
“Talent is only the tip of the iceberg,” she said. “You have to be fiercely driven and willing to accept rejection over and over again. I think that realization has really kicked me in the a– and I am finally beginning to take risks.”
