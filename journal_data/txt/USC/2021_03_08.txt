When fans or players complain about the ruthless nature of personnel decisions in professional sports, they’re usually met with the response: It’s just business. 
When athletes or coaches are rewarded with a swift kick out the door after devoting months, years and sometimes decades to one organization they’re told to take it on the chin, because that’s just how mainstream professional sports work.
Imagine spending years devoting yourself to one job, at one company, in one city — potentially even raising a family there. For the sake of this example, let’s say the city is Los Angeles, Calif. Now, imagine opening Twitter one day and finding out you’re being relocated to Detroit, Mich., which is just over 2,000 miles away. Oh and by the way, you need to report by the end of the week.  
Doesn’t sound fun, does it? 
This happened to Brooklyn Nets forward Blake Griffin. In the summer of 2017, Griffin was one of the most valuable players available in the NBA free agent market. The Los Angeles Clippers, Griffin’s team at the time, were determined to woo their star forward with an elaborate pitch convincing him to re-sign with the team.
When Griffin arrived at Staples Center for his meeting with the Clippers, owner Steve Ballmer and company brought out all the stops. The hallways were lined with photos of Griffin as a child. The Clippers, who have never retired a players’ jersey number, put on a mock jersey retirement ceremony for Griffin and his son. Clippers’ employees in attendance wore t-shirts featuring Griffin’s face alongside a collage of figures such as Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King Jr. and Barack Obama. 
Eventually, whether the pitch had anything to do with it or not, Griffin signed an extension to stay with the Clippers for four more years. A little over half a year later, the Clippers decided to trade Griffin to the Detroit Pistons, and the forward found out through Twitter. Griffin had given the Clippers eight years of his life and his word. In return, the Clippers gave one of the franchises’ most iconic figures an unceremonial exit out the proverbial back door. 
Griffin’s situation, albeit extreme, is not unique either. It’s happened to countless athletes before him. Time and time again, athletes are lied to about their future, shipped away like property and offered little support in the process. Situations like these are why I find it hard to criticize players who leave teams in free agency, request trades or demand their release. In most situations, the behavior is absolutely justifiable. 
Since the traditional professional sports model involves frequent roster turnover, fans tend to have a stronger bond with the team they support rather than specific players. Thus, when a team parts ways with a beloved or highly-paid player, fans tend to side with the organization, as a way of rationalizing the team’s decision and remaining loyal to the team. When players try to employ the “it’s just business” strategy, doing what’s best for them regardless of sentiment, they’re casted as “disloyal” or labeled with NBA Twitter’s favorite insult, “snake.”
The unfair balance of power between franchises and players creates a dilemma where players are forced to either remain with their current teams or leave and risk being cast as someone who’s “selfish” or “only in it for the money.” 
In recent years, we’ve seen a shift from players remaining loyal to their teams. Athletes are more candid than ever about doing what’s best for them regardless of allegiance or public perception. It’s hard to blame players for biting back after being burned by the myth of “loyalty” in professional sports for so long.
But how far are we willing to let the pendulum swing before we see another correction? 
Player empowerment has recently shifted into an entirely new stratosphere with players, particularly in the NBA, able to essentially dictate where they want to play and who they want to play with regardless of the time remaining on their contract. 
Just this past season, it felt like everyone involved in the league let out a collective sigh when Milwaukee Bucks star forward Giannis Antetokounmpo signed a multi-year contract extension with the team. Why? Because he didn’t leave. Yes, we’ve gotten to the point where we celebrate when players don’t skip town.
I’m not sure where to draw the line, nor am I suggesting to have any solutions that would curtail the recent player migration to big markets. However, I can empathize with the Houston Rockets fans who spent the last eight years rooting for James Harden. They spent their hard-earned money on merchandise and tickets, only for him to essentially quit on the team, publicly ask out and leave the organization to clean up the mess.
Or the New Orleans Pelicans fan who spent seven years rooting for Anthony Davis to launch the city into long-awaited basketball relevance, only for him to decide he’d rather play for the Lakers.
Perhaps players can be incentivized to stay with their original teams if the “super-max” is raised even higher. The consistent movement of star players can be slowed with a fine or draft pick reduction for teams who trade players on high-level contracts less than two seasons into their deal. Penalizing teams and players who try to initiate trades after making five-, six- and sometimes seven-year commitments could force organizations and athletes to think twice about moving on from star players.
Both sides of this argument have a point: players have a little too much leverage, while franchises are unfairly able to treat human beings as commodities or assets. Although we don’t seem particularly close to a resolution to this issue, there has to be a better way to resolve these situations, for all parties involved.

By the time this column comes out, it’ll have been a week since the Golden Globes, but I still want to talk about Chloé Zhao. Can we talk about how great she is? She, a Chinese woman, virtually entered a room and came out as Best Director. She broke records and made history.
“Nomadland” won Best Motion Picture, a testament to Zhao’s abilities as a director and writer. Chinese nationalists claimed her as the “pride of China” — yet, “Nomadland” was recently censored in mainland China for a comment Zhao made in 2013 that was allegedly “anti-China.” Asian Americans laud her victory as a win for Asian American representation in the United States. 
Throughout all of this, her narrative will be politicized, as any discussion of a Chinese woman winning an acclaimed U.S. award will be. 
This isn’t to say that it shouldn’t be. As a Chinese American, I do believe that Zhao occupies a unique intersection between China and the United States — something that Chinese Americans are no stranger to. On both Chinese and U.S. social media platforms, there is and will continue to be discourse about what her “success” means, the implications of her rich celebrity family background and most importantly, whether she’s a Chinese or U.S. storyteller.
Inevitably, there will be the recurring theme that Zhao living in the United States for so long has diminished her Chinese sensibility. There will be the idea that a film’s success can somehow represent one’s whole identity. There will be the idea that because her stories don’t explicitly factor in Chinese-ness, she has truly broken out of the box and become a universal storyteller. 
All of this is to say, of course, that “universal” means stories about the human condition, which in that regard, “Nomadland” is. “Nomadland” is a beautiful story of what it means to be human and alone. It’s important to recognize, however, that some Chinese audiences don’t view it as a “universal” story. Shanghai-based film critic Xiao Fuqiu described it as a “pure U.S. story,” echoing the thoughts of other Chinese film experts. 
I’m saying this because I’m wary about the idea of “universality.” I’m concerned that “universality” might mean Chinese storytellers being recognized for stories separate from Chinese-ness implies that they have decided to be less Chinese in favor of a “universal” identity. Maybe because to me, a story about Chinese people is just as much a story about the human condition. 
Obviously, I’m no expert on politics (nor much of anything, for that matter). I’m just a Chinese American girl who wants to be creative and, similar to Zhao, tell stories about the human condition. So for purely selfish reasons, I want to think about Zhao not through matters of citizenship or who can truly “own” her success — I want to think about being Chinese as a matter of being creative and recognized as a Chinese person owning your own success.
Zhao has stated in an interview with Vulture that being Chinese was simply the context in which she existed as a Chinese person in China. She herself has said that she isn’t that interested in politics. This doesn’t necessarily mean, however, that she isn’t proud of being Chinese — being Chinese just felt normal to her. She felt freedom in not necessarily having to tell stories about being Chinese. There was a kind of merit to be found in distance. 
Likewise, I think Chinese storytellers should be able to tell stories about whatever they’re passionate about, because there’s nuance in specificity. Whether the story is an “American Western” or about Chinese communities, I believe that Chinese people making art is in itself creativity that should be celebrated as any other. 
I believe that it’s important to recognize and center Zhao’s own words in this. She wants to tell stories “bigger than her.” To me, it’s not so much about “transcending” identity as it is about centering yourself within the story and trusting yourself to do it right. 
We can celebrate success while questioning ideals of universality. We can feel gratified that a Chinese woman, a woman of color, has become the first Asian woman to win Best Director. We can do all of that while questioning whether Chinese storytellers need to tell stories that aren’t about Chinese people in order to be internationally recognized. 
We can also reflect: what does it mean when a Chinese filmmaker coming from China can tell such a “pure U.S. story,” and do it well? 
A recent article in The New York Times about Zhao’s success is titled “Chloé Zhao becomes the first Asian woman to win the Golden Globe for best director.” At the very bottom, a correction reads: “An earlier version of this article mischaracterized Chloe Zhao as Asian-American. She’s Chinese.”
Yes, she is. She’s a Chinese storyteller who has gotten recognized for her storytelling — and for a Chinese girl like me, that’s the dream.

“Raya and the Last Dragon,” directed by Don Hall and Carlos López Estrada, is a new Disney fantasy and action film that draws from Southeast Asian cultures. It is a feel-good movie that, although follows many of the common Disney movie tropes, is ultimately an entertaining film worth rewatching.
Five hundred years ago, the land of Kumandra lived unitedly and prosperously with the dragons. However, after an attack by the Druun — evil spirits that turn living creatures to stone upon touch — all but one dragon sacrificed themselves and their magic, creating a magical orb to fend off the Druun. Sisu (Awkwafina), the last remaining dragon, was rumored to have disappeared.
Due to the people’s greed for the orb’s magic, they fought and Kumandra was broken up into five tribes named after the different parts of a dragon: Fang, Heart, Tail, Spine and Talon.
After an attack by the enemy tribes, Princess of the Heart tribe Raya (Kelly Marie Tran) and her father Chief Benja (Daniel Dae Kim) failed to save the magical dragon orb that has been in their tribe’s possession. During the tussle, the orb broke into five pieces and elicited the return of the Druun, who turned much of the people from all different tribes into stone, including Raya’s father. Six years later, Raya finds Sisu and embarks on a quest to retrieve the broken pieces of the dragon orb and bring back all those who were turned to stone.
If the plot sounds familiar, that’s because it probably is.
“Raya and the Last Dragon” is a tried and true Disney film with a pretty formulaic plot and story structure. Raya is a strong and clever protagonist who is, naturally, accompanied by an animal sidekick named Tuk Tuk, an adorable, armadillo-like creature. In classic Disney fashion, Raya loses someone important to her, causing her to embark on a crazy journey to bring them back. Along the way, she meets comic relief characters, gets into fights with enemies and ultimately gets into a climatic battle where the bad guy turns good, and inspirational music plays while Kumandra gets restored.
Audiences are made aware of Raya’s motivations, however at times it was difficult to completely resonate with her character. As the protagonist, she was tasked with telling a lot of the backstory, which left very little room for her own character’s development. Out of all the characters, Raya may have been the most underdeveloped. She also follows the classic formula of a typical Disney protagonist: has a good heart, skilled but a little … boring?
Raya certainly was not one of the most complex characters, unlike Namaari (Gemma Chan) who certainly deserves that title much more as the film depicts her internal struggle in choosing between what she thought was right versus what her mother told her was for the good of their people. Even Noi (Thalia Tran), the orphaned baby who turned to a life of thievery as a result, that Raya meets on the way had more character. The audience does not witness much of Raya’s character development until near the end of the movie, when her inability to trust others almost causes her to lose everything, and she finally grows from her mistakes.
With a weak protagonist, at times it was difficult to connect to the story. However, Awkwafina’s incredible voice acting and Sisu the dragon’s character made up for what Raya lacked. Sisu may be one of the highlights of the movie. The character is beautifully designed with ombres of blue and purple, and has a decently complex character with a great sense of humor.
While Raya is often a little dry, Sisu is constantly lively and engaging. In addition to her humorous side, Sisu also displays real emotional depth, as she also lost everyone to the Druuns. The balance between Sisu’s personality aspects made her a character that audiences could connect to and grow to love. Awkwafina’s personality and spunk added real dimension to her character as well.
The action sequences of the film were another highlight and incredibly well-done. They were well-paced and gave an opportunity to show off the strong women warriors, as well as add emotional impact for much of the character’s motivations became clear through the fight sequences. The animation and design of the characters’ weapons were also impressive, with the most notable one being Raya’s sword that can swing out and retract like a dragon’s tail.
Although the beginning of the movie moved at a bit of a fast pace, around the middle to end of the film it slows down and highlights some impactful scenes. There is a good balance between funny moments, serious moments and magical moments, adding depth to the overall story. 
“Raya and the Last Dragon” gives some much needed Southeast Asian representation in entertainment media. The set, costume designs and Kumandran language all contain many odes to their Southeast Asian ties. The characters are also designed in a way that makes them appear Asian without relying on stereotypical traits. However, the film fell short in providing behind-the-scenes representation as many of the cast were of East Asian descent rather than Southeast Asian.
Although the story was nothing revolutionary, it was an enjoyable and feel-good movie that you probably wouldn’t watch a second time. It was easy to follow and the animation was stunning, with great attention to detail when animating particularly hard elements, such as water streams and mounds of sand. The set and costume design were also impressively colorful. Although the movie clearly followed the classic Disney formula, it is certainly not a bad formula. And it definitely helps that Raya’s animal sidekick Tuk Tuk is so darn cute.

As record cold temperatures descended on Texas this past February, increased demand for electricity, coupled with ill-equipped utility plants, led to millions of people facing power outages.
Headlines focused on Sen. Ted Cruz’s vacation to Cancún or Gov. Greg Abbott incorrectly blaming the Green New Deal for the outages. I noticed, however, a lack of national coverage about the role nonprofits played in mitigating disaster. I get it — discussing nonprofits’ role in disasters isn’t exactly the best clickbait. But, have no fear! I can highlight the outstanding work of emergency response nonprofits in the United States.
The situation in Texas is the culmination of local nonprofits’ decade-long evolution to better support communities both before and after disaster strikes. Let’s rewind to 2005, when Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc on New Orleans, killing more than 1,800 people and displacing hundreds of thousands. The flooding of the city led to more than $100 billion in damages. 
Following the hurricane’s destruction, the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s slow response faced heavy criticism across the country. Katrina Gay, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, claims that when federal government assistance eventually arrived in New Orleans, it lacked the trust of the community and often re-traumatized victims. 
Lt. Col. Ron Busroe, a leader in the Salvation Army, realized the necessity of forging relationships with local organizations to better understand the community. While the Salvation Army, like other large nonprofits, is nationally recognized and has a solid infrastructure, it had to rely on partnerships with smaller organizations to focus on problems unique to New Orleans. 
The delayed government response in New Orleans inspired the founding of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, a 365-day-a-year resource for private philanthropy for disaster recovery still in use today. In 2018, the Center for Disaster Philanthropy distributed over $15 million in grants to organizations dealing with disasters. 
This past month, the swift response of nonprofits contrasted with the slow government response in Texas highlighted the importance of local organizations. During the outages, the Texas Division of Emergency Management didn’t use the Emergency Alert System to share updates with impacted residents. Abbott defended the lack of communication by telling constituents they could Google search this information. Considering residents lacked internet access due to the power outages, the governor’s tip wasn’t particularly useful. 
When the government faltered, nonprofits stepped up to the plate. In Austin, local volunteers relocated the city’s unhoused population to hotel rooms. Arlington Life Shelter opened up its doors to those in need of emergency shelter. The Austin Area Urban League, a civil rights organization, started a week-long emergency donation collection under the hashtag #LoveThyNeighborTX. Another Austin based nonprofit, Front Steps, began a blanket drive for people experiencing homelessness. Texas nonprofits acted swiftly and admirably, helping countless people left cold and in the dark for days. 
While applauding how nonprofits pick up the slack of the government, however, I want to recognize room for improvement. Instead of reacting to disasters, nonprofits can alleviate further damage through preventative measures. Rather than creating temporary housing after a flood and moving on, nonprofits must ensure sustained protection.
Long-term recovery includes rebuilding, providing mental healthcare, organizing education for children who lost their schools and helping residents with insurance claims. The work of nonprofits cannot end once media coverage for the disaster dies down. 
In order to achieve long-term and steady impact, however, donors must assist nonprofits with consistent charitable giving. A large number of donations to organizations flow in immediately following a disaster, then quickly drop after a few weeks. Despite taking years to rebuild communities, giving almost completely stops after five or six months after a disaster. 
Unfortunately, the situation in Texas is not the first, nor will it be the last disaster in the country. Although government and national organizations are an integral component to disaster recovery, local nonprofits are often better positioned to expeditiously support their communities. Nonprofits have resources for short-term disaster assistance, but not much else. They stick a band-aid on the situation, knowing when disaster strikes again the process repeats. 
Continued donations years after a disaster allow nonprofits, especially local nonprofits, to impactfully respond. When disaster relief nonprofits spend more time, money and energy upfront, they ensure the protection of lives and livelihoods in the future.

During the past year, Angelenos have become infected with the coronavirus at a disproportionate rate to other communities throughout the United States. Within the Los Angeles community, South Central was hit even harder. 
Now that vaccines are being rolled out, it would be natural to expect members of the South Central community to receive their fair share of vaccinations, given how drastic the infection rate has become among the population. However, this is not the case.
Although the vaccination rate for seniors in L.A. County has increased in the last few weeks, the vaccination rates for residents in South Central has been significantly lower than those of wealthier neighborhoods in the county, according to L.A. County Public Health Data. Wealthier and predominantly white communities such as Beverly Hills, Brentwood and Rancho Palos Verdes are being vaccinated at a higher rate than the poorest L.A. communities — specifically, South Central, which is made up of 28 densely populated communities and includes the University Park area. 
In South Central, approximately 63% of households are renters, and only about 8% of residents hold four-year college degrees. The community of South Central is also majority Black and Indigenous people and people of color, with 80% of the residents identifying as Latinx and 18% as Black. The disparity in vaccination rates is an exemplification of the wealth gap in our society — highlighting the intersectional issues of race and class. Our society continually offers unequal opportunities to the economically disenfranchised. It is unfair, immoral and should be addressed immediately. 
An L.A. Times analysis found that only one out of 24 South Central residents has been vaccinated so far, while the positivity rate for the coronavirus in the area was 1 in 6. Meanwhile, Manhattan Beach has vaccinated 1 in 6 of its residents, despite the positivity rate being 1 in 30. Calabasas has vaccinated 1 in 5 of its residents, while the positivity rate was 1 in 22. Other wealthy L.A. neighborhoods with similar ratios include Pacific Palisades and Brentwood. It’s as if the vaccination rate and infection rate percentages have been flipped between more wealthy L.A. communities and poorer L.A. communities.
According to Dr. Paul Simon, chief science officer for the L.A. County Department of Public Health, the greatest contributing factor to this disparity is the registration process. Wealthier communities, with residents who can afford to spend hours and hours finding an appointment, can often register with more success than poorer Angelenos who must work and cannot afford to spend as much time on the website. 
Furthermore, drive through and distribution sites, such as Dodger Stadium, which were designed to provide easy and quick access to vaccinations don’t actually allow easier access to poorer Angelenos.
This inequity should not surprise us, but it should outrage us. More needs to be done to structure a vaccination program which levels the field or, more accurately, favors, at least in the short term, communities most affected by the pandemic. The struggle to get poorer L.A. neighborhoods vaccinated is happening in other cities across the country as well, such as Philadelphia, San Diego and Washington D.C. 
So what is the solution? Cities should up vaccination centers with early sign-ups for specific zip codes representing neighborhoods that were hit the hardest by the coronavirus. This is already happening in Baltimore and New York City. In the same vein, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced last week that USC will be hosting a city-run vaccination site at USC’s University Park Campus.  The city is also partnering with Uber to provide 15,000 free rides and 20,000 half-off rides to transport South Central residents to the site.
By limiting access to only those neighborhoods most affected by the coronavirus, the disparity that exists between communities can be decreased. Even though people of every ethnicity and socioeconomic background must be vaccinated, the priority in the short term — until vaccinations are readily available to all Americans — must be to the marginalized communities that were the most impacted by the coronavirus.

Su Lei Waddy, a student in Myanmar taking a full-time course load, used to attend her classes synchronously from Myanmar. Every day, she would log into Zoom at around 1:30 to 8:30 a.m. Rangoon time. 
“I would participate in all class discussions live, and I was getting good at [being nocturnal],” said Waddy, a junior majoring in accounting and business administration.
Then the coup escalated.
On Feb. 1, Myanmar’s government was overtaken by the Burmese military, or the Tatmadaw, which claimed a fraudulent election against the National League for Democracy in Nov. 2020. The day before the newly elected officials were sworn in, Burmese armed forces detained President of Myanmar Win Myint and State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, as well as ministers, deputies and members of Parliament. Since then, thousands of people have taken to the streets in massive riots against the illegitimate government.
More than 38 people died Wednesday during violent riots in what the United Nations called “the bloodiest day” since the start of the coup. Riot police opened fire without warning on large crowds. In the streets of Yangon, Myanmar’s largest city, footage shows police beating medical staff and civilians. Kidnappings and shootings have been regularly reported by the BBC, Yahoo! News, Reuters and other international news media since the riots began.
For Waddy, the coup has posed challenges in all aspects of her life, including academics. 
Since Feb. 13, every night from 1 a.m. to 9 a.m., the military government turns off Wi-Fi access across the nation. It began with limited access to certain sites and spotty connectivity, but now, even accessing basic searches is illegal and power outages are frequent, according to Waddy. 
“We can’t even log on to Blackboard without a VPN anymore,” Waddy said. 
Every night before 1 a.m., Waddy logs onto Blackboard and downloads any work that she could do offline. Since the nightly Wi-Fi shutoffs cut into class time, she has no choice but to asynchronously complete coursework during the day. 
“These days, I have like two brain cells left because of this whole thing and I use all two of my brain cells to fight this coup, basically,” Waddy said. 
When connectivity returns in the morning, Waddy said she is met by headlines about refugee camps getting burned down and protesters being shot by riot police.
“It’s definitely not normal,” she said.
Waddy said she has trouble concentrating on her schoolwork because “when you’re in a coup, the coup is all you think about, all the time.” However, Waddy said her professors have been understanding and supportive of her situation, allowing her to watch lectures and submit assignments at her own pace; they even asked to continue to be informed of her situation. 
Waddy said it makes her feel “a little bit better” to know that at least her professors support her, but that it doesn’t mean she isn’t affected by what is happening anymore. 
As USC Burmese Student Association president, Waddy has consistently voiced her concerns on social media and has gone to several protests.
However, after over a month of tireless activism, Waddy said she is not standing down, and neither is Karl Aung Zin, a member of BURSA. Zin, a junior majoring in economics and business administration, is currently attending class in Myanmar with a reduced course load. Like Waddy, he has not ceased in his efforts to increase awareness about the situation by protesting, fundraising, posting on social media and taking on interviews with international news sources.
From the moment Zin wakes up at 9 a.m., he spends the day reading news stories, watching livestreams of protests and checking on new legislation on freedom of speech and freedom of privacy passed by the military government. 
“I can’t get out of bed because I need to follow all of this news. I need to know if it’s safe to go out today, if the roads [are] blocked,” Zin said. 
This has been the cycle for the past month — from the moment he wakes up to the moment before Wi-Fi shutoffs, Zin said. Right before shutoffs, he sends his friends in Myanmar messages to be safe tonight and to call him if anything happens to them.
“It seems like the world has stopped for us, and it has,” Zin said. “People are not going to work, both in the public and private sector. Things are not open except for grocery stores.” 
“Our rights are being taken away every day,” he said, mentioning the Feb. 13 order signed by military ruler General Min Aung Hlaing. The order suspended three sections of privacy laws that stripped the need for a court order to detain prisoners for over 24 hours or to enter, search and make arrests on private property, according to Reuters.
Regarding USC, Zin said the University has not done enough to show solidarity with its Burmese students during this time.
“The personal support we’ve gotten has been great … but USC as an institution has been extremely frustrating [in] dealing with the situation,” Zin said. 
Thirty-two days after emailing President Carol Folt and Provost Charles Zukoski, the University sent a “Message of Concern and Support” Thursday to the Burmese students from Vice President of Student Affairs Winston B. Crisp. The letter extended resources from the offices mentioned above and informed the students that USC stands with them. It also encouraged students to keep in contact with Campus Support and Intervention.
“On behalf of the senior administration and myself, I want to thank you for your continued advocacy for the Bumese student community and know that your voices are heard,” Crisp said in the message.
On Friday, Burmese students met with Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp and Vice Provost of Academic Programs Andrew Stott. During the meeting, the students expressed their concerns about the delayed action of the University as well as how USC could increase academic, financial and personal resources for them.
Waddy said that USC’s response has been “one of the best” compared to other universities because of the accommodations and resources provided by professors and various departments in the University. 
Nonetheless, the students are pushing for a Universitywide public statement condemning the coup and support for Burmese students. Zin attributes the administration’s delayed action to the low number of Burmese students — just 13 students attend the University. 
“We feel that because we’re a small group, we’re a minority, our voices are not important enough for the administration to respond to us,” Zin said in regard to the lack of response from the University during the first month of the coup. “We just want USC as an institution to take our side and to recognize our struggles and our fight.”
Zin said the email would not only be a symbolic act of solidarity, but a practical help for Burmese students. While Zin’s professor knows about his situation, most of his clubs and extracurriculars are unaware. 
Banks remain inoperable in Myanmar as professionals such as medical workers and bankers partake in the Civil Disobedience Movement. For this reason, Burmese students are also asking for financial support for students through an emergency fund, tuition forgiveness and extended payment deadlines.
Waddy and Zin both said resources such as Campus Support and Intervention, the Office of International Students and Counseling and Mental Health Services have been extremely supportive by offering personal, academic and professional services to all Burmese students. 
However, Zin said the Undergraduate Student Government was extremely slow in putting out a statement. The statement went out almost two weeks after the start of the coup, on Feb. 13, and USG had email issues with distributing the statement across the student body, according to Waddy.
Despite this, Waddy said USG senators and BURSA were able to collaborate on USG’s statement, stating the specific demands of the Burmese students regarding finances, counseling services and a University-issued statement.
The Daily Trojan reached out to USG for comment but did not hear back in time for publication.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan on Feb. 24, USC said they have reached out to support the 13 international students from Myanmar, including those in the local area. This support has been extended by departments such as the Office of International Services, Campus Support and Intervention, Counseling and Mental Health Services and Student Basic Needs, according to the statement. 
The statement also asserted that USC is offering counseling, providing access to the Student Basic Needs emergency fund and working with faculty to guarantee students are allowed flexibility on attendance and deadlines. 
“Counseling and Mental Health Services and Campus Support and Intervention also have met with leaders of the USC Burmese Student Association and maintain open communications with them,” the statement read. “We will continue to support our students throughout the semester as they navigate through this challenging time.”
Both Zin and Waddy said they feel that the protests are a turning point in Myanmar’s history because of the mobilization of millions through social media activism that has taken place in the past year. 
“This is the first time in our country’s history where we’re even allowed, we’re given a platform like this to speak about this,” Zin said. 
Much of Myanmar’s history has been one of military rule after it gained independence from Britain in 1948. Since the 1960s, Myanmar has faced challenges in gaining stability in its military government, facing violent repression from the government, isolationist economic policies and civil war with ethnic minorities in the nation. 
For decades, past generations of Burmese people have attempted to revolt, which has resulted in bloodshed. But starting in 2011, the nation was edging its way closer to a full democracy under the framework of the military’s 2008 constitution. 
“Our grandparents have already suffered enough and our parents have already suffered enough,” Waddy said. “Being there on the streets, it is empowering in a sense, because you know that it’s not just you, but hundreds of thousands, or even millions of people feel the same way, and that they are not being silenced … They are trying to do something to make a difference.”
The Burmese people continue to stand in solidarity. While public healthcare workers are on strike against the government, private hospitals are offering free health care to protesters. In Mandalay, a city in Myanmar, protesters mourned the life of teenager Kyal Sin, known as Angel, who was killed in the riots Wednesday. They sang anti-coup chants and walked her funeral route hand in hand.
“You are willing to give away your life, because you know that this fight is something that is much, much bigger, for your entire country and for future generations,” Waddy said.
The coup, and the opposition and protests, or “Spring Revolution,” against it, have captured worldwide attention, but Zin calls on the USC community to raise awareness of the issue. This includes signing a petition for the International Criminal Court to charge Hlaing for his crimes and sharing the petition to mobilize around this cause.
Most of all, both Zin and Waddy recognize how being vocal on social media can extend the reach of this issue. 
“If non-Burmese people see our cries for help [and] our social media posts, I just want them to know that [reposting them] is not performative activism, and if they just help us share some posts, [it] won’t be considered performative activism because it’s different from social issues in America,” Zin said. “Sharing just one Instagram slide means a lot more to us to get that message out there.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated a Universitywide email as being a symbolic act of solitude, instead of solidarity. It also misstated that the coup is now being called the Spring Revolution. Instead, the opposition and protests against the coup is now being called the Spring Revolution. It also misstated the National League for Democracy as the National League of Democracy. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

So I’ve been having spine issues. Pain, weakness, creaking, cracking — you name it, it’s there. The joke that I’ve known and participated in since before I could remember is that if you start to have back problems, it means you are getting old, so buckle up. 
At 21 years old, this is not the way to think about it. Am I still nervous about engaging in activities that need my back to be at its strongest, or could risk injury? Of course. One of those activities is surfing.
There’s an unfortunate trend in any sport that once a child reaches a certain “age” — that age being particular to the difficulty of the sport on the body and mind — they have lost any chance at being one of the greats. They might as well quit. 
When I paddle out, and of course this depends on the time, the day, the conditions etc., I find it unsurprising that most of the surfers out there are male, but it is fascinating that many of them are nowhere near my age — especially those older than me. You don’t even have to be in the water to engage in that camaraderie; my dad, a surfer who favored Zuma Beach back in the ’60s, has recently bonded with co-workers who happen to be former Dewey Weber team riders and are still chugging in their 60s. 
But there’s no better place to turn to than the world tour and pro circuit to see the longevity of surfing in a person’s life. You know who is about to compete in a heat when the commentators constantly mention age and “the GOAT” in their sentences: it’s Kelly Slater. 
Slater is repeatedly hounded by rumors about when his final year on tour will come, the condition of his body, but very few times does the media mention that not only is he the oldest world champion in men’s history, but also the youngest. The 20-year-olds on the tour would still rather draw a heat with someone else for a better chance at winning. 
But this is a hyper-visible athlete we’re talking about, which makes this point seem like a one-off. Arguably the greatest surfer ever on the women’s tour, Australian Layne Beachley, won her record-breaking seventh world title in 2006 at 34 years old. Nathan Fletcher, the style-master of the Vans surf team, recently went for one of the biggest airs ever at Pipeline at 46 years old. Not-to-be-forgotten big wave surfer Peter Mel caught probably the best barrel to ever be surfed in a century at Mavericks, still fearless at 51. 
Are any of these surfers “old?” Absolutely not. With their knowledge of ocean swells, home breaks and dicey waves, they will remain at the top of the sport for a long time to come, regardless if it is in competition or not. 
It’s important to remember this even in the face of emerging talent in the form of 16-year-old Jai Glindeman, or in the loss of one of surfing’s best, Andy Irons, at 32. At any stage of your life setting aside fear, unwarranted shame or instant gratification can lead to a whole new world of opportunity to grow as a person and as an athlete. Any assumptions that lead to narrow thinking in what you should be doing or what you are “too old for” only leaves you defenseless to your own self-doubt. 
Lauren Mattice is a senior writing about surfing. She is also the digital managing editor at the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Spring Swell,” runs every other Monday.

Many awards shows are virtually hosting their celebrations online due to the pandemic. Despite the circumstances, the Caucus for Producers, Writers & Directors, a pillar in the entertainment industry, held its 38th annual awards show Thursday. Throughout the evening, the award show highlighted young filmmakers and professionals as well as praised honorees for their cinematic achievements in 2020.
Planning the show looked different this year. Sharon Arnett, president of the Caucus Foundation, and Jim Hirsh, caucus co-chair and board member of the foundation, were able to put on a spectacular show using the limitations of a virtual ceremony to their advantage. 
“I will say our list of honorees, as spectacular as it is, would not have been possible in a non-[coronavirus] world,” Hirsh said. “Lord knows where everybody came from, the ability to do this as we are [virtually] is probably the only way it would have happened.”
The honorees were spread across time zones from Nicole Kidman in Australia to Susanne Bier in Denmark. 
The show started with a sweet message from the legendary Norman Lear, who reminded the audience to stay safe and wear their masks. 
The host, James Pickens Jr., introduced Kidman as the presenter of the Director of the Year award which was given to Susanne Bier for “The Undoing.” Kidman praised Bier’s spirit of collaboration and attention to detail in character.
“I would thank the Caucus for giving me this prize, in particular Jim Hirsh and Rob Papazlian — thank you so much,” Bier said. 
Robert Papazian, Caucus co-chair, presented the Writer of the Year award to Academy Award winner Aaron Sorkin, writer and director of “The Trial of the Chicago 7,” noting his deft storytelling ability.
Sorkin kindly thanked the Caucus and commended them for acknowledging and financially supporting students.
“The Caucus plays a more important role than just giving me an award,” Sorkin said. “The money the Caucus raises to award grants to promising students, helps them get started in what we all know is a very difficult world.”
The Caucus is not only representative of its members, but they also have a subset, known as the Caucus Foundation, which awards up-and-coming filmmakers grants to complete their projects. 
Three of the six 2020 grantees were current or former USC students. 
USC students Damon Laguna, Kathryn Boyd-Batstone and Mel Orpen were honored during the ceremony in a segment hosted by Alfonso Ribeiro. 
“Since its inception [the foundation] has given over $2 million to college students to finish their projects,” Hirsh said. “A part of what we’re trying to raise money for Thursday night, is to plan for a future in which we can reach even further, not just help college students finish projects, but open the door to help all kinds of people to find a path in the industry.”
USC professor and producer Gail Katz received Educator of the Year. Katz is the Mary Pickford Endowed chair and the faculty chair at the School of Cinematic Arts. Dozens of students have been recognized for their work under her tutelage. She thanked her students for their resilience in her acceptance speech. 
The Humanitarian Award, presented by Hirsch, was given to St. Louis community leaders and philanthropists Jeanne and the late Tom Townsend. The Townsends began Pianos for People to grant easier access to musical education in marginalized neighborhoods in St. Louis. 
Jeanne’s acceptance was accompanied by a performance by Royce Martin, a Pianos for People student prodigy. 
Octavia Spencer presented the Producer of the Year to Reese Witherspoon, Lauren Neustadter and their production company, Hello Sunshine. Witherspoon and Neustadter accepted the award and vowed to continue to make women-centered stories going forward. 
“I have met some of the most extraordinary female storytellers and learned so much through our collaborations,” Witherspoon said. “I never thought I would have these opportunities to create with my most extraordinary peers.” 
Marsai Martin was awarded the Rising Star Award. Martin is best known for her roles in “black-ish” and “Little.” Donna Langley noted Martin’s vast accomplishments, reminding viewers that she is only 16. Martin is a world record holder for youngest executive producer and a nine-time NAACP Image Awards recipient. 
To conclude the night, television producer Vin Di Bona earned the Caucus Legend Award which honors a successful career in the entertainment industry. Ribeiro presented the award and noted Di Bona’s solidification in television history for his work with “America’s Funniest Home Videos.”
The awards show finished with virtual applause. But, the Caucus extends beyond the awards and grants. Throughout the year they host panels about diversity and inclusion in the industry that are accessible on their website. 
Now that the awards are over, Arnettt and Hirsh are looking forward to reading submissions for the 2021 grant recipients. 
“For me getting to hear other viewpoints, seeing where people come from, how they approach it and watching their creativity and ingenuity, I’m very happy to be encouraging [the next generation],” Arnett said. “It’s very exciting.”
