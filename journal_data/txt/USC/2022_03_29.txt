Food embodies a special meaning for each person. For DeVonn Francis, food is an essential part of his Caribbean heritage, and Yardy World was his creative studio where he used culinary arts to investigate his own role in Caribbean culture and for others to celebrate their identities.
During the “Activism Through Food and Art” virtual event last Thursday, the first-generation Jamaican American chef and artist talked about how his Caribbean heritage inspired him to add a unique taste to personal cuisines and a special perspective on the photo series he made. 
Nia Lee, an Annenberg Civic Media Fellow and founder of Stormé Supper Club, which centers on queer Black women and nonbinary people, moderated the event. Jennifer Francis, the DeVonn’s mother and one of the main collaborators, also joined the event.
DeVonn first came up with the idea of Yardy World in 2017. Just a year before that, he was trying to find his identity in society while promoting his heritage. One day, he found some family photos of his parents after they immigrated to the United States. While looking at them, DeVonn felt an energy that made him feel good. In one of his Instagram posts, DeVonn said that the photos helped him realize his parents are his heroes in both Jamaican food and culture. This is also how he came up with the name of his company, as Yardy is a variation of “Yardie,” which refers to a person of Jamaican origin or descent.
“[Yardy World] came from not just my love for Caribbean cuisine or culture at large, but really me trying to find my place as a queer person who was first generation, living in New York and who went to art school and who wasn’t a chef, who didn’t go to cooking school, and figuring out how my voice and identity and passion fit into that history,” DeVonn said.
DeVonn said he believes what differentiates his Caribbean cuisines from traditional ones is the space he lives in, the experience and culture he has and the stories he heard while growing up. For instance, Francis designs his recipes through drawings and diagrams. Before going to the kitchen, Francis would use logic maps to work out how he wanted to make the cuisines. 
“Essentially, thinking about things as components, right? What are the things that make you keep going back to food,” DeVonn said. “My goal was always like, ‘What are the things about Jamaican and Caribbean cuisine that makes me want to come back, that make people want to come back?’ And then just expanding on that is sort of my first point of the process.” 
DeVonn also said he believes that the current commodification of food drives him away from opening a restaurant — instead, he wants food to be worthy of receiving. 
“[Food is] worth the cycle rather than something that is expected to be there for you,” DeVonn said. 
Besides cooking, DeVonn also introduced his photography. His experiences in photography at art school equipped him to use projects to advocate for his Caribbean heritage. In a set of photos taken in 2019, DeVonn featured his parents and siblings posing in front of vibrant colors and different types of food posited on the table —s a recurring motif in his photos.
“[The dinner table] is not just like ‘This is where you eat.’ But this is where you are basically putting on a show,” DeVonn said. “You can live as whoever you kind of want at the dinner table, you can bring your highest sense of self to the dinner table.”
DeVonn said he believed the photos serve as a documentation of Jamaican history and embody profound cultural meanings.
“This collection of photos is really a project of archiving not only the history… but also empowering and encouraging myself and the people who work for Yardy World and, quite honestly my family members too, to realize that we’re not just replicating history but are also living legacies of a history too. We are a continuation of history too.” DeVonn said.
DeVonn also shared advice to audience members wishing to highlight their cultural heritage and history through food.
“The first thing that I did before I even started my company is, I found chefs and I found mentors,” he said. “I found people who I really looked up to and I reached out to them and I spent time with them.” 
When it comes to the future development of Yardy World, Jennifer said she has high hopes for her son and her daughter, who also placed effort in promoting Jamaican culture and heritage by staging for DeVonn’s photoshoots.
“They’re doing a good job, they’re doing a great job,” she said. “They’ve just amazed me so much with all that they’ve accomplished. So I’m just excited to see what happens … five years from now.”
Although he enjoys his career as a chef, DeVonn looks to teach in the future. 
“I’ve always wanted to have a cooking school or some sort of teaching lab that was actually based in the Caribbean, something where people can go in and learn and not just about food,” Francis said. “We’re really thinking about food as a source of independence.”
The event lasted for 90 minutes and was both inspiring and elevating to the audience.
“I want to thank you both for joining us today,” Lee said. “This has been a really powerful and informative talk.”

Before Sunday night’s 94th Academy Awards, it was hard to imagine an Oscars moment that could be more calamitous than when “La La Land” (2016) was mistakenly announced to have won Best Picture over “Moonlight” in 2017. Yet, a physical altercation between two beloved movie stars raised the bar for chaos during this year’s awards. 
Deep into the Oscars ceremony, comedian Chris Rock took a few jabs at members of the audience, specifically joking about Jada Pinkett-Smith’s hair. Pinkett-Smith shaved all of her hair off last year in response to her public struggle with alopecia, a chronic hair loss condition, causing her husband, Will Smith, to take offense to the joke. 
“Jada, I love you. G.I. Jane 2, can’t wait to see you,” Rock said. Smith proceeded to walk on stage and smack Rock across the face on live television. 
While the audio was cut from this moment in the United States by ABC, other countries’ feeds caught Smith yelling obscenities at Rock from his seat. Rock gave a nervous laugh on stage and defended his joke. The uncensored altercation has circulated online thanks to international watchers who flooded social media with the clip.
Shortly after the incident, Smith won the Best Actor award for his performance in “King Richard” (2021) and delivered a hesitant acceptance speech, apologizing to the Academy and his fellow nominees. With tears streaming down his face, Smith mentioned how fellow actor, Denzel Washington, pulled him aside a few moments earlier and told him that “at the highest moment, be careful, that’s when the devil comes for you.” 
The Academy later posted on their Twitter account that the organization “does not condone violence of any form.” While the organization tried its hardest to keep the night moving, it was hard for the ceremony’s winners to not be overshadowed by the incident.
Regarding those wins, Apple’s “CODA” became the first Best Picture Oscar winner produced by a streaming service, hinting at the future of streaming services and their impact on the movie industry. “CODA” (2021) dives into the story of Ruby, the only hearing member of a financially struggling, deaf family on the East Coast. The film additionally won Best Adapted Screenplay, and Troy Kotsur became the first deaf man to win an acting prize at the Oscars, taking home the Best Supporting Actor award. 
“This is dedicated to the deaf community, the CODA community and the disabled community,” he said. Kotsur’s ASL interpreter became audibly overcome with emotion as Kotsur told the audience about his father, who, once the best sign language performer in the family, became paralayzed and unable to perform ASL. 
“Dune” swept the ceremony with six wins, including Best Original Score, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. The film’s lead, Timothée Chalamet, arrived bare-chested to the show in a Louis Vuitton womenswear suit, living up to the expectations of his usual, standard-challenging red carpet looks from past award shows. 
Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes proved themselves to be quite the comedic trio as the Oscars’ hosts, the first to host the awards since Jimmy Kimmel in 2018. Schumer didn’t fail at making a classic Leonardo DiCaprio joke about his young lovers and even took a stab at Aaron Sorkin for his humorless Lucille Ball biopic, “Being the Ricardos.” 
“The inclination to make a movie about Lucille Ball without even a moment that’s funny,” she said. “It’s like making a biopic about Michael Jordan and just showing the bus trips between games.” 
Billie Eilish and Finneas delivered a captivating performance of their James Bond film track, “No Time to Die.” The brother and sister duo later won Best Original Song for the track, Eillish’s jaw-dropping at the announcement of their names. Beyoncé, a fellow nominee for the award, gave a thrilling performance as well, performing “King Richard’s” “Be Alive” on a tennis court in Compton, Calif.
The Oscars took a different route this year in an effort to boost viewer ratings by presenting a “Cheer Moment” and “Fan Favorite” award, decided by users on Twitter. Zack Snyder’s “Army of the Dead” won “Fan Favorite” and Snyder’s “Justice League” scene in which the Flash enters the speed force won the “Cheer Moment.” Evidently though, it seems that the Academy got the attention it was looking for thanks to Rock and Smith’s wild altercation, whether that press proves to be good or bad.

Students flooded the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Saturday, trembling with excitement for the return of Springfest, USC’s annual spring concert, last held in person in 2019. It was the first Springfest for a majority of the student body, and the first ever at USC’s beloved stadium.
With a new venue, a stacked lineup and a lifted mask mandate, this was USC’s first “normal” concert in a long time. The USC Concerts Committee, the organization responsible for Springfest, achieved its longtime goal of moving the concert to the Coliseum, according to committee co-director Benjamin Kronenberg. 
“The Concerts Committee has always dreamt of throwing Springfest at the Coliseum,” Kronenberg said. “It’s definitely something special to be able to throw a free concert for students to appreciate and enjoy [at] a landmark that they can really call their home.” 
Kronenberg said the committee selected Dominic Fike as the night’s main performer because they saw him as someone who could excite students.
“We wanted to focus on bringing artists to our shows who are relevant, but also incredible musicians,” Kronberg said. “[Fike]’s definitely someone we wanted to book all year.”
Vendor Village
Doors opened to students and guests at 4 p.m., but a few students — the artist residents of the Vendor Village — were present hours earlier to prepare their booths outside the Coliseum, between food trucks and the student stage. 
Prospective vendors applied to secure one of the 20 spaces. Selected groups ranged from long-standing student clubs such as KXSC Radio and Haute USC to newer student-run brands like Froot, a startup focused on making bra buying easier and more inclusive. For founders Nina Cragg and Ashara Wilson, their pop-up at Springfest presented a new challenge. 
“It was basically doing a mini manufacturing process ourselves,” Cragg said. “Going through that whole process of buying goods, packaging them, branding them, [has been] a lot of work.”
Other vendors came to Springfest with the same wish: to connect with a new audience. Across the Vendor Village, painter Adeline Jackson stood proudly behind a table of prints and T-shirts featuring her work. Jackson said that after crafting her collection throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Springfest was her first in-person event as a vendor. 
“[Springfest] is a great opportunity for more people — not just my friends — to be able see my art and hopefully resonate with it a little bit,” Jackson said.
Another unique aspect of the Vendor Village was the sense of community between vendors in attendance. Under an airbrushed canopy, Fort Reno founder Alex Carmen sat alongside his designed sweatshirts, vests and tees, basking the atmosphere.
“Being able to meet people and exercise my own vulnerability, to reach out to someone and have a conversation, it’s really nice to be able to do and vending helps me get better at that,” Carmen said.
Student Performances
As students perused the Vendor Village, the crowd around the student stage grew. The intimate stage was propped with background panels of long vertical mirrors with iconic art paintings in-between, producing a cozy environment.
Students were welcomed to that comforting sphere by opening student artist Mehki Clay with his debut single and the first song of his set, “waiting 4 u.” His purple crocheted bunny hat, orange-yellow rectangle glasses, gold embellished green vest and purple slacks reflected his electric energy, as he had the crowd reminiscing with iconic covers such as Paramore’s “Misery Business.” With the toss of his crochet cap into the audience and the conclusion of the first set of the night, Clay established excitement for the performers to come.
Following a brief intermission, Maddy Davis took the stage, welcomed by friends and fans. Her indie-pop love songs had the crowd clutching their hearts and waving their hands in the air — especially with the impressive lyricism of “Can’t Do This Alone.” Davis’ dancing on stage and jams with her guitarist inspired the crowd to head bop and sway to her tunes — many of which unfortunately aren’t released yet.
As the gleaming sun started to set, Ellie Williams brightened the stage with her vocal clarity and contagious musicality. With her overalls, electric guitar and charisma, Williams had the audience engaged throughout her set of hit songs and cover of Amy Winehouse’s “Valerie.”  During one of her songs, “Perfect Playlist,” a dance circle formed, with one student backflipping from excitement.
Ashes to Amber then transported attendees to a sunset drive down the Pacific Coast Highway with his groovy music. With his bright blue electric guitar adorned with orange flames, he commanded the crowd as the sun set — his incredible instrumental improvisation was the perfect soundtrack to a stunning Southern California moment.
Dusk was met with Alix Page’s ethereal voice as she sang her original song, “Frank.” The indie bedroom-pop tune recounts the artist’s story of a fleeting summer romance. After spending the year opening for Gracie Abrams on her “This Is What It Feels Like” tour, Page emoted solemn confidence on stage that sent listeners into a love-sick reverie. 
To finish off the student performances at Springfest, Sumit hyped up the crowd with a boisterous hip-hop set. He waved his hands, summoning the crowd to jump and sing along the entire time. The upbeat tunes lulled a large crowd dancing around the red and teal-lit stage, mirroring Sumit’s incredible background dancers. The performers splashed water onto the excited crowd — cooling them off and igniting their excitement for the headliners to come.
Dominic Fike
A long day of activities, vendors and student performances began to wind down as lines to the entrance continued to fill up. Students lined the outside gate of the Coliseum bringing both their guests and their excitement as they rushed to see opener Claire Rosinkranz and support SG Lewis.
As Fike’s set grew closer, it became clear that if you didn’t get there early, you wouldn’t be standing in the gated off section closest to the main stage. Between his EP, album and handful of singles, Fike had an extensive and relevant discography to choose from for his setlist — the only challenge would be including the favorites, which fans were hoping to hear live. However, not all attendees were familiar with Fike’s music before the concert.
“I honestly know him mostly from ‘Euphoria.’ I don’t really know his music, but he’s been on the radar recently, so I’m excited to see him,” said Grace Albano, a sophomore majoring in theatre.
Fike recently starred in Season 2 of HBO’s “Euphoria,” alongside Zendaya and Hunter Schafer. As a star on the rise, Fike stirred up a lot of buzz within the USC community, demonstrated by the hundreds of students who showed up to see him.
“[Fike is] honestly a really good choice because he’s relevant. They could have picked someone that was kind of famous, people knew, that was falling off, but I feel like Dominic Fike is just getting bigger,” Albano said.
As the clock hit 10, Fike came to the stage and the crowd erupted, cheering encouragingly. Fike opened with his song “Come Here,” and played some of his other hits, such as “Why,” “Açaí Bowl,” “Politics & Violence,” “Phone Numbers” and of course, “3 Nights.”
The crowd cleared out as Fike ended his set, pleased with a night full of USC student convivalry, great music and even some laughs, as Fike battled to remember the chords of “Why” on his guitar. Fans of his music and acting alike left satisfied, while others were fulfilled by just seeing the young star amid his rise.
With Springfest 2022 exceeding expectations, the committee is already looking ahead to 2023, excitedly planning next year’s festivities.
“[Springfest] is probably, I think, one of the coolest things that USC has to offer,” Kronenberg said. “We’re really proud of the way the show turned out, and I know that people on the committee are already starting to think of next year.”

In the early 2000s, the emergence of indie alternative rock was sparked by bands like The Strokes and The White Stripes. The rules to play were simple: guitar, drums, bass, keys and an, often male, guttural singing voice. Sing of heartbreak, new love or something mildly controversial. Play sold out shows. Sell cool T-shirts.
But since the birth of this genre in America over 20 years ago, we’re now looking at a much different musical landscape. Genres from Katy Perry-pop to Chainsmokers-EDM have faded in and out. How have alternative rock bands been able to stay relevant, even successful?
Enter Wallows. The trio, which formed in 2011 and started releasing music in 2017, lead the genre in a new music streaming world. And with the drop of their second studio breakup album, “Tell Me That It’s Over,” the group has declared that they’re here to stay.
“Tell Me That It’s Over” is heartbreak through the hexagonal sunglasses of an indie boy. The album’s theme is simple: We are young; we are falling in and out of love; are we missing out on something greater we should explore alone? It’s early-20-something romantic existentialism in a pair of Converse sneakers.
The first thing to note is their ability to keep fundamental elements of their alt-rock predecessors while utilizing modern music technology to keep their sound fresh. Intro track “Hard To Believe” juxtaposes crunchy guitar breaks with ethereal bass and chimed trilling to symbolize the casual chaos of heartbreak. During a first listen, it’s impossible to know quite where the song is going next sonically — it kicks everything off with a thrill of anticipation.
It certainly sets the tone for the rest of the album, which draws upon similar elements to demonstrate innovation in their sound. “I Don’t Want to Talk,” the first single released ahead of the album, sets multiple stages throughout the track by adding constant sonic variance from verse to verse — arpeggiated synths, reversed drum noises, even a harmonica. Still, it makes you feel like a teenager in the ’90s jumping around in your bedroom. “Missing Out” is an emotional, heavy rock guitar anthem about letting love go (think the last hug before breaking up). However, it’s able to evoke emotion through an ethereal build up in the postchorus — another example of a successful marriage between classic and modern styles.
Others stray further away from the classic indie alt sound. Second single and third track “Especially You” is boxy, abstract and colorful. Its sonic layers, in all its crunchy and synthetic glory, are almost custom built to fit into the grooves of your brain. With computer glitching noises and vocal melodies reminiscent of playground taunting, it’s a nostalgic and easy listen. Third single “At the End of the Day” feels like an ’80s slow dance anthem, layering bouncing synths with ringtone-esque guitar picking that build into a full rollicking chorus. “Marvelous” immerses you into a fleeting thought of longing against the backdrop of a bustling crowd, boasting of fast-paced melodies and even trumpeteers toward the back end of the song. 
Topically, the album does get a little repetitive and cliche. The “I can’t get you off my mind” and “You pushed me away” can feel a bit indie boy whiny at times. Additionally, it remains glaringly clear that Wallows’ strengths don’t lie in singing prowess, as the majority of their melodies stay in a vocal safe zone. And, the vocals of Lydia Night in “Permanent Price” add a twinkling refreshment to the album, but they stick out slightly compared to previous collaborations with feminine vocals (Remi Wolf on “OK” or Clairo on “Are You Bored Yet?”).
But, where Wallows excels is their ability to successfully combine classic alt-rock elements with modern music technology to create a unique, immersive atmosphere in their music. Especially in the album’s final track, “Guitar Romantic Search Adventure,” the dreamy instrumental breaks truly feel like soaring into the pink sunset clouds of postbreakup optimism. Each song stands alone in its own right, and somehow still blends together to set the universe of “Tell Me That It’s Over:” glittering stars, scuffed painted sneakers, opening the windows of an ancient Toyota Camry, blasting music with your friends while overlooking a sparkling city.
In demonstrating their promising ability to innovate and world-build in “Tell Me That It’s Over,” it’s evident that Wallows is only just getting started.

During her senior year, Nwodim began to take acting classes with the Upright Citizens Brigade, an improvisational and sketch comedy theater and training center founded by comedians Amy Poehler, Matt Walsh, Matt Besser and Ian Roberts. There, she honed her comedic skills before moving to New York City and landing a role as a featured performer on SNL in 2018 — the seventh Black woman to be hired as a cast member.
“Ego is a tremendously talented entertainer whose hilarious and brilliant satire on social and racial issues makes people think as she makes them laugh,” said Dornsife Dean Amber D. Miller in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We couldn’t be more proud to call her one of our Dornsife alumni.”
A main SNL cast member since 2020, Nwodim always knew she wanted to pursue a career in entertainment, she told Deadline Hollywood. However her mother, a physician, wanted her to go to college to study something that could provide her with financial stability later in life. Thus, a deal was struck between the two: Nwodim would attend college on a pre-med track if she was allowed to move to Los Angeles, where she could pursue her acting career while studying.
Acting was always Nwodim’s goal, but she did not get into comedy until her agent insisted she take an improv class. While she fell in love with the class, the final push to becoming a comedian was a reel she made interpreting various characters. She showed it to her friends, and they said it was the most genuine thing Nwodim had ever done.
Nwodim was featured in the 2016 CBS Diversity Showcase and was named one of the New Faces at the 2016 Just for Laughs festival in Montreal. In 2017, she sold out her first ever one-woman show, “Great Black Women … and Then There’s Me.” In 2019 Variety’s Comedy Impact recognized Nwodim in their issue.
Nwodim was rejected the first time she auditioned for SNL in 2015 and struggled with imposter syndrome even after her hire in 2018. However, she said she has since talked herself out of the feeling easily. Some of her most popular SNL roles are her portrayal of Dionne Warwick, A Weary Mother in Her Darkest Hour, a Nigerian Parent and A Black Woman Who Has Been Missing for Ten Years. She has also made multiple guest appearances on Comedy Bang! Bang!, a comedy podcast.
In the future, Nwodim would like to have her own dramedy show and direct, she said in an interview with Shondaland. 
“I’ve found myself in positions in this industry that I did not anticipate, so I’m cool with just being open to where life or this work might take me,” Nwodim said.
The Dornsife satellite commencement ceremonies will take place on Cromwell Field May 13 at 11 a.m. and 2:30 p.m.

A “100% U.S. Army disabled veteran” currently undergoing treatment for two forms of cancer, Edward Wong is no stranger to resilience. So, when it comes to home maintenance, the challenges he faces pale in comparison to past adversities. 
For Wong, the home has always been a place of particular importance. At 74 years old, he lives alone in Crenshaw, about three miles west of University Park Campus. His house predates him, at “80 some odd years old.” His roots in Crenshaw go even further back – Wong’s 92-year-old mother has lived in his childhood home, only two blocks away, since 1953. 
Despite the West Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Medical Center’s attempt to get him to relocate or sell his home, Wong remains insistent. 
 “If I have to die on my patio, I wish to do it that way,” he said.
Wong has put those words into action – taking part in the Handyworker program run by the L.A. Housing Department, which provides minor home repairs for low-income residents. Through the program, Wong had his patio rebuilt and painted. 
After the Handyworker program concluded, Wong received a phone call out of the blue from his now “go-to brother and sister” – Steven Bradley and Zeeda Daniele from the L.A. affiliate of Rebuilding Together — a nonprofit organization that offers no-cost home repairs for low-income households — which has a long-standing partnership with the USC Davis School of Gerontology. 
After the closing of the organization’s original L.A. affiliate, Jon Pynoos, professor at the USC Davis School of Gerontology and director of the USC Fall Prevention Center of Excellence, served as a member of the steering committee for the Rebuilding Together affiliate.
Bradley and Daniele, who serve as the executive director and program manager, respectively, told Wong he was selected as one of the first homeowners to partake in the L.A. program.  
What lay ahead was “no little Mickey Mouse Job,” Wong said. Beginning Jan. 20, the Rebuilding Together team engaged in what Wong called “heavy-duty plumbing” — including replacing an entire toilet, installing new faucets in the bathtub and breaking down tile walls to get to pipes. 
Pragmatism runs core to Rebuilding Together’s operations. Many of the homes that the organization works on have seen no repairs for a decade, even two or three decades in some cases. Daniele said the highest income she has seen for a homeowner served by the Rebuilding Together affiliate is $36,000. 
Because of the constrained resources available — Daniele said the program could “spend every single dollar on five clients” during the beginning of their operation — the team has had to allocate their resources and time for the greatest net impact. Daniele’s experience at Fannie Mae, where she worked on real estate and housing lending for more than 16 years, has prepared her for this fiscal discipline well — a requisite for running events such as the Kickoff to Rebuild, an annual event sanctioned by the Super Bowl to repair homes in host cities. 
When it came to the Kickoff to Rebuild, the greater effort of the surrounding community came to light. Nine volunteers, donning T-shirts from Lowe’s — a sponsor of the Kickoff to Rebuild — came to replace all of Wong’s plants with a colorful new assortment. 
Wong also met NFL wide receiver Robert Woods, a player for the L.A. Rams, who participated in the event as a Lowe’s volunteer.
Rebuilding Together’s partnership with the Davis School was critical for the Kickoff to Rebuild event, which focused on neighborhoods within a five-mile radius of the University Park Campus. Leon Watts III, a graduate of the Davis School and a learning and development specialist at the Fall Prevention Center of Excellence, directly served as a site captain, putting his 40 years of home repair experience into action.  
“They had six hours, all together, set up to do the work,” Watts said. “My crew was able to do it in three hours.”
Reflecting on the relationship between the Davis School and Rebuilding Together, Pynoos said the partnership is “complex, growing, rich.”
“We can take what we have learned in research and put it into practice and involve students in something very real, that improves, directly, the lives of older persons and persons with disabilities,” Pynoos said.
The Executive Certificate for Home Modification program, which Pynoos co-founded, has been core to Rebuilding Together and the Davis School’s partnership. The program, which offers holistic instruction on home modification, is offered at a discounted rate to Rebuilding Together staff nationwide. 
Established in January 2020, the partnership has trained 48 Rebuilding Together contractors, according to the organization’s most recent figures in April 2021. 
Looking forward, Wong remains evangelical about the Rebuilding Together program. Despite his insistence, Wong’s mother — who was born in China — has been less receptive to the outside help Rebuilding Together offers. 
“Their generation is different from my generation,” Wong said, adding that “they don’t trust outsiders.”  
In the meantime, Wong focuses on those closer to his age, including his fellow veterans at the American Legion. And, one word still comes up when Wong talks about Daniele and Bradley — “godsend.” 
“They care about us old farts,” Wong said about the people behind the Kickoff to Rebuild. “Just like family.”

Every year on my sister’s birthday, I interrogate her to figure out what kind of cake I should make and, every year, she asks for the same thing: boxed white cake filled with strawberries and whipped cream. Every year, this decadent cake reminds me of a universal law: Boxed cake mix is better.
Of all the vanilla cakes in the world, none can ever compete with Betty Crocker’s. The just-barely crunchy exterior gives way to the moist crumb, defying physics by gaining color without becoming dry.
 Boxed cake mix was first invented in the 1930s due to molasses surpluses, but sales of these mixes skyrocketed after World War II. As families reunited and celebrated together again, cake became more important than ever. Though its popularity has ebbed and flowed since then, boxed cake mix has remained a household fixture ever since.
The popularity of boxed cake mix is indisputable. Nearly 186 million Americans used boxed cake mix in 2020 alone. Despite its success, most bakers and foodies alike treat boxed cake mix with disdain, as if bakers who use these mixes are not bakers at all.
To bake a cake from scratch requires an endless list of materials and ingredients as well as a considerable amount of time and knowledge. Most cake recipes require the brave baker to acquire eight to 10 ingredients and expensive products such as stand mixers and cake levelers before they begin their task.
It’s not enough to show up with all the necessary tools. While recipes offer much-needed guidance, the baker must undertake the burden of figuring out how soft the butter needs to be, how pale and fluffy the creamed butter-sugarmixture must be or how set the cake must be before it’s pulled from the oven.
It takes an endless list of ingredients, materials, time and knowledge to make a cake from scratch that will rival your local bakery.
Boxed cake mix takes a hobby with a nearly insurmountable barrier to entry and makes it accessible to anyone. This invention streamlines the number of ingredients and necessary resources and removes any of the uncertainty from the process of making a cake. All it takes is three household ingredients, a functional oven, a pan and a mix to make something delicious.
Rather than appreciating the way boxed cake mix increases access to the joys of baking, we spend time telling people that they don’t have a place in the baking community because they didn’t work hard enough on their baked goods.
In a capitalist framework, we are taught value is directly proportional to rarity. We are constantly hoping for invitations to the most exclusive parties or experiences because we immediately assume that they are the most worthwhile. 
It is the reason Billy MacFarland convinced hordes of consumers to purchase tickets to Fyre Fest, his exclusive music festival, and spring for pricey VIP packages, even as there was no proof the experience was worth the cost. It is the reason Supreme, an apparel company with weekly limited clothing drops, sells out of their goods minutes after they release. Exclusivity becomes the only way to consider ourselves a part of the upper echelon. 
Gatekeeping the joy of baking allows from-scratch-bakers to convince themselves that they are part of a special group. By looking down upon those who make cake from a mix, these from-scratch-bakers view their baked goods as higher in value.
We seem to forget that joy and celebration are not finite resources. Food is sustenance, but cake is love, joy, connection and celebration. We bake cakes to celebrate our most important milestones, from birthdays to new jobs to anniversaries. Regardless of how it is made, cake takes a party and turns it into a celebration. If the purpose of baking is to unite communities and spread joy, boxed-mix cake achieves that goal just as successfully as any other.
 Though the change appears insignificant, reimagining baking communities gives us the opportunity to imagine a more accessible world. It is time we change the narrative. Rather than upholding exclusive communities gatekept by antiquated biases, we must imagine a world where inclusivity is not just an idea but a guiding principle. This might be as simple as finding joy in making a boxed cake.

Last month, USC announced they will partner with the United States Space Force, a branch of the Air Force dedicated to evolving air defense in space. For students, this partnership means they will receive access to numerous research and career opportunities within the space and defense industry. 
Lynn Kirby, a spokesperson for the Space Force, said USC students will receive “a consistent pipeline of STEM talent via scholarship, internship and mentorship opportunities for ROTC cadets, university students and faculty.” Regardless of feelings about the Space Force itself, the partnership is impressive, to say the least, and is especially beneficial to students interested in this field. 
Imagine if this same type of academic partnership model was applied to other sectors such as education, infrastructure or housing. If presented with similar opportunities and incentives, the government would have the brightest minds working within these crucial public sectors while increasing the likelihood of student employment. 
Funneling the smartest young minds in the country into public sector and government positions will not only help students but also improve the country itself. 
Creating partnerships creates the necessary connections between our governments, universities and industries. As in the Space Force partnership with USC, students should receive access to various mentorships, internships and resources for each of those specific industries. With students becoming increasingly confused over their career paths, speaking from experience, pipelines between these various structures give students the resources needed to pursue their careers. 
In a 2018 annual report from Handshake, an online platform connecting over 9 million students with 250,000 employers, the federal government did not rank among the top 25 employers with the most entry-level job applications. A large reason is that other firms and companies have strong partnerships with campuses and regularly hold recruiting events for students. Students can form relationships with recruiters from as early as their freshman year. However, government job recruiters can and should create these same connections with students through university partnerships.
The 2020 election, where young voter turnout was up 11% from 2016, is only one example of an increase of interest from the younger generation to pursue a career within the government. Furthermore, in a study done by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, around 25% of college students ranked the government as one of their three target industries. The interest and motivation from students are there. You would think a nation centered around capitalism would have taken advantage of this by now.
In terms of what the partnership should look like, it can be a copy-and-paste of USC’s Space Force collaboration but just to more branches of government. Especially with the numerous obstacles the country faces — the Ukraine-Russia conflict, climate change and coronavirus — and more in the future, we need our best and brightest running this country. Times are changing and it’s time to let the younger generation take charge.

We’re almost done with the semester!
Can you believe how fast it went by? I swear, there’s something about in-person classes that just makes everything go by in such a flash.
To be fair, it also has been a while since I’ve last written one of these columns. But don’t worry dear readers, I’ve been paying attention to the things that have happened around the esports scene and the gaming industry in general (and totally not neglecting my responsibilities to start a new run in “Elden Ring” for the third time, OK?)
All jokes aside, some interesting things did happen. And, since the Oscars just aired this Sunday, I’ll take the opportunity to talk about another award show. 
Yes, you guessed it, I’ll be talking about The Streamer Awards.
For those of you who don’t know about the awards, let me explain: Much like the actual Academy Awards, The Streamer Awards were created to celebrate streaming culture. As such, the event honored both content creators and games, regardless of platform or website. 
There were various categories, ranging from niche ones, such as Best Strategy Game Streamer, to more popular ones, such as Streamer of the Year. This ensured that, regardless of your particular tastes, there was still a streamer or award category that you enjoyed. 
The main difference between The Streamer Awards and other similar shows, however, is that the former was created by Twitch streamer QTCinderella. In other words, instead of an outside organization coming in and deciding how to run the event, it was led entirely by streamers themselves. 
While that might have been a recipe for disaster, considering how streamers are not usually involved in the creative process, the actual event proved otherwise. With streamers having free reign over how the show played out, the entire ceremony suddenly had a relaxed and fun vibe, which would have been impossible to replicate artificially. 
People cussed, called each other out and genuinely acted as they did on stream, making the audience feel right at home. When streamers did get serious or offer a nice speech about the state of the industry, it felt even more special, since the viewers were not bombarded with formality from the start.
The event’s success becomes clear once we look at the numbers. With an average audience of 260,000 viewers throughout the entire event and a peak of 380,000 viewers, the stream broke Twitch history, being one of the top 50 most-watched streams of all time on the platform. 
There has been some controversy following the actual winners, with some communities feeling cheated. Still, taking into consideration the winners were largely decided by popular vote, some creators feel as if fans only have themselves to blame. Overall, though, the stream was a resounding victory for the streaming community at large.
Now, if you’ve read my columns, you’re probably bracing yourself for me to say something about the esports community, right? After all, it’s high time for me to write some blatant segue like, “how can the esports industry learn from this?”
Well, dear reader, I am happy to say that you can rest easy: I’m not planning on asking that question (at least for this one column. My corny transitions have become sort of a staple, you know). This is because esports was already recognized in categories such as Best Super Smash Bros. Streamer, Best Valorant Streamer and Best League of Legends Streamer, among many others. 
Sure, they’re not necessarily celebrating professional athletes. But by having esports alongside other categories, the ceremony helps in legitimizing the industry as part of a greater, vibrant ecosystem. That goes in direct contrast with how esports is usually seen: a different and separated world from casual gaming. While that might help plan events, since only big esports fans would attend the tournaments, that severing also makes the entire industry seem unapproachable to newcomers who already enjoy video games, let alone those who barely know anything about gaming.
By reinforcing the fact that esports is still a part of the gaming ecosystem, The Streamer Awards destroy that barrier, bringing both worlds together once more, and reminding hardcore and casual fans alike where esports came from in the first place. Does that lead to weird dissonances where pro Super Smash Bros. players are side-by-side with VTubers styled after anime girls? Certainly. But if gamers love both creators, it might just be better to bite the bullet.
Because of this, I wanted to take the opportunity to highlight this ceremony and what it did right. After all, while I have given plenty of unsolicited advice to the industry throughout my columns, it is rare to come across a successful alternative to the current status quo.
Instead of concentrating power at the hands of the gaming companies and using streamers as a marketing tool, the streamer awards offered a vision of what happens when the creative power is at the hands of those who have to interact with the audience for a living.
Plus, like I mentioned before, it also does wonders to the actual gaming niche communities it serves. By bringing everyone together, it makes every single group feel respected and celebrated, while also opening the door for people to discover new interests that they previously thought were inaccessible, such as hardcore esports. This, of course, makes the event a true ceremony of the gaming community as a whole. 
While this dynamic won’t work for every form of esports event, it shows an alternative path — one that puts the creative force behind the artists themselves — is still possible and highly enjoyable, even if that means giving a bunch of drunk streamers full control over the ceremony. 
After all, as Will Smith himself proved during the Oscars, things are more fun if they go a little off the rails.

No. 17 women’s tennis came up short in close conference matches against No. 19 Stanford and No. 14 UC Berkeley this past weekend. The team now sits at 1-7 on the road and 3-3 in the Pac-12. 
Senior Danielle Willson said the team does not want to be defined by the season’s close losses.
“I would say we would all agree that we’ve kind of had a patchy season a little bit in the past couple of weeks,” said Willson in a phone interview. “The motivation for us is to go out there and compete whenever we have the opportunity.”
The first of the two losses for the Trojans came Friday against the Cardinal. Stanford got on the board first with the doubles point and kept its foot on the gas pedal heading into the singles matches, building a 3-0 lead at one point. 
Sophomore Naomi Cheong, No. 78 in the nation for singles, scored USC’s first point of the day after defeating Cardinal sophomore India Houghton 6-2, 6-3. However, the Trojans would not remain in the winning column after Stanford senior Sara Choy beat Willson 6-2, 6-4.
Although the match had already been clinched, the duel between junior Eryn Cayetano and Stanford’s freshman Alexandra Yepifanova went on. Both are ranked No. 6 and No. 18 for singles, respectively. 
Cayetano continued her stellar play this year as she defeated Yepifanova 5-7, 6-2, 1-0 (8) to make the final score of the match 5-2. She also handed Yepifanova her sixth loss of the year and her first loss since March 6.
Despite the loss, Willson said she was impressed by Cayetano’s performance.
“For me, as a senior, that’s the kind of player I want to look like,” Willson said. “That match can show the younger girls that every point matters.”
The Trojans again battled hard in the second match against Cal Saturday but ultimately fell short to the Golden Bears 4-3. The match started similarly to the Stanford bout as Cal striked first with the doubles point.
 In the singles matches, No. 41 senior Salma Ewing tied the match at one apiece after she defeated No. 101 juniorHaley Giavara 6-2, 6-3. 
USC would then drop three consecutive singles matches to lose the match, but play continued for Willson and Cayetano in their courts. 
Both were able to rack up wins as Willson first defeated junior Erin Richardson 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. Cayetano then beat freshman Jessica Alsola 6-3, 2-6, 6-4. 
Willson said the doubles point gave the Golden Bears an extra step ahead of the Trojans but saw improvements in the team’sperformance after the loss against Stanford. 
“Even though we did come out with a loss, there was improvements from the Stanford match and the Cal match with respect to people’s body language and positivity on the court,” Willson said 
Although USC ended March on a three-match losing streak, the team remained undefeated at home during the month going 3-0 and 7-3 on the season. The Trojans will now look forward to April as eight of the team’s final nine matches will take place at home. 
“There’s gonna be a strong sense of motivation and just like eagerness for this weekend,” Willson said. “We have our fans [and] family, and I think that definitely gives us an edge over our opponents, but we still have to go out there and stay eager for every point and just compete hard.”
USC will face Washington State at home Friday at 1:30 p.m.
