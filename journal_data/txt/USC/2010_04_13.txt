As part of the first ever Africa Week, experts gathered Tuesday to discuss the media’s failure to show the culture and everyday life of African people through its news coverage.
Breaking news · Bob Reid, the executive vice president and general manager of the Africa Channel, talks about ways the media could better portray Africa and its issues to the public. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The panel, organized by Daniel Atwater, president of the USC branch of the Sierra Leone Educational Enrichment Project, was one of five events held this week as part of Africa Week. The week’s events, which include film screenings and discussion, focus on different countries within the continent and on positive exposure and development in the continent.
Atwater said he, among others, coordinated and marketed Africa Week, which he said will be scheduled every April in the future. By collaborating with other student organizations like Invisible Children, a group dedicated to raising awareness about children in Uganda, and reaching out to Adam Clayton Powell, vice provost for globalization, he was able to put together the string of events that started Saturday and will end today.
Invisible Children had hoped to launch Africa Week last year, but it did not come together.
“So I said, ‘You know what, Invisible Children, I’ll make sure it finally happens,’” Atwater said.
Tuesday’s panel, which was the highlight of Africa Week, included Michael Parks, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism and former Pulitzer Prize winner who has worked as a foreign correspondent in Africa; Chris Mendez, technology director of the Tiziano Project; Bob Reid, executive vice president and general manager of the Africa Channel; and Carola Weil, associate dean for planning and strategic initiatives at Annenberg. About 50 students, faculty staff and outside visitors attended the event.
All of the panelists agreed there is a lack of positive coverage of Africa in the media but spoke of different ways to approach the issue.
Parks said it is important for the media to help the public understand aspects of life in Africa aside from its problems.
“It it might be an answer to solving our understanding Africa, which is thin … undernourished and needs a complete re-orientation,” Parks said. “If there’s no conflict, there’s no story. And that’s not sufficient.”
Reid looked back on his life as a child growing up in the segregated South. He was constantly bombarded with negative images of Africa, for example, through the popular film Tarzan, which he said depicts the only smart character as the white man. Reid mentioned he didn’t think stereotyping of the continent has changed much since that day.
“The point is the lack of knowledge breeds not only contempt but ignorance,” Reid said.
Reid mentioned that conflict journalism leads to a lack of interest in investing in Africa and a fear of traveling there.
“There are these great stories out of Africa that are on T.V. in Africa, and all over Africa, but these are not stories that are seen in the U.S.,” Reid said.
Reid mentioned that the Africa Channel exists because there are a great number of stories to be told and mentioned a new program the Africa Channel is working on that will allow first time visitors to Africa share their experiences.
Weil said there are many questions to be thinking about and plenty of market forces to consider when discussing why Africa hasn’t gotten more positive coverage.
“There are market forces that drive the stories that make it to the front covers and the headlines,” she said. “It’s not just about bad news telling, it’s about who sits in the decision-making positions — who are the editors?”
Mendez is the director of technology for the Tiziano Project, a multimedia website founded by USC alumni and students that aims to help people in conflict zones like Northern Iraq. He said technology has opened up new doors for storytelling in African countries.
“[There are] 350 million people on Facebook, hundreds of millions of videos being uploaded on YouTube every single hour,” he said.
Parks noted that better and more varied press coverage, though helpful, is not the answer to all of Africa’s problems.
“We need a different type of journalism if we’re going to understand Africa,” Parks said. “[But] we’re not going to solve the problems of Africa, Africans need to do that. But our understanding of Africa needs a tremendous improvement.”

USC’s recycling efforts could still be improved, but as students who toured USC’s waste management facility Tuesday found out, more than half of USC’s waste is ultimately diverted from landfills.
USC waste management and the Undergraduate Student Government led a tour Tuesday of the Athens Services Material Recovery Facility, which handles USC’s waste. The tour was intended to give students deeper insight into how recycling works at USC.
“Most people don’t know about recycling at USC,” said John Baldo, USG director of university affairs. “There’s this huge perception [that] we don’t recycle.”
According to Eric Johnson of USC waste management, USC collected a total of 7,695 tons of waste in 2009. Of that waste, 3,899 of those tons were recycled, giving the school a diversion rate of 51 percent.
Everything put into USC’s trash and recycling bins goes to either the Athens Services facility in the City of Industry, Calif., or to a recycling plant closer to USC, said Mario Gutierrez, vice president of operations at Athens Services, who headed the tour.
At the facility, waste is generally sorted into a processing pile and a transfer pile at the beginning of each process. The processing pile is sorted for recyclables while the transfer pile goes straight to a landfill.
“Some loads aren’t worth processing,” Gutierrez said. “We see if it’s what we call ‘fluffy’ or ‘not fluffy’ — ‘fluffy’ being the good, recyclable material. I have to be really selective about the material process.”
Gutierrez said the facility does as much as it can to divert trash from landfills. It takes trash from all over the San Gabriel Valley, and about 25 percent of the waste gets diverted from landfills.
Sorters at the facility divide wood, metal, paper and plastic into specific areas, where they are sorted further for processing.
Some material is then baled together and sent overseas. China, for example, pays the facility to export paper and plastics. Textiles are burned at a special facility to produce electricity, and food waste is sent to a composting facility in Victorville, Calif.
Though USC’s diversion rate is 51 percent, there are ways to improve it, Baldo said.
“If we sort trash [before it goes to the facility], we can get above that 50 percent,” Baldo said.
USC currently uses a two-bin system. Everything placed in bins designated for recycling actually goes to a separate recycling plant closer to USC, while all of the waste that gets placed in normal trash bins goes to the Athens plant to be sorted.
“Separate your recycling,” Gutierrez said. “Whatever we take to the other recycling center — the university gets all of that material back. That’s where you’re going to get more bang for your buck.”
Johnson said it is important for students to feel responsible for and excited about recycling efforts.
“Students need to know what is recyclable and where they can throw it,” Johnson said in an e-mail. “It seems easy, but many of us throw away something that can be recycled in a trash container because it is more convenient.”
Students on the tour said they were glad to see that USC is working to be sustainable.
“I’m pleased that USC actually goes through their garbage,” said Brandie Gordon, a senior majoring in political science who went on the tour. “I didn’t know how important it was to sort trash and that food waste could ruin recyclables.”
Baldo said he thought, overall, the tour went well.
“We want to show students what’s going on with trash — how we do things and how we can do it better, and thinking about how it can improve,” Baldo said.
Most of all, the tour quelled concerns that USC doesn’t recycle.
“Students have a lot of concerns, but if it gets into USC bins, it will be processed,” Gutierrez said.
It’s probably worth checking on Athens’s claims. According to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, Athens’s facility in Industry is an environmental disaster, and Athens recently paid the biggest AQMD fine in history.

After two weeks of spring practice, USC’s offensive-line still looks more like five strangers at a Big & Tall than a cohesive, synchronized unit. While the big men pushed around the scout team with relative ease at Tuesday’s practice, first team drills made it clear that the starting five still have some getting acquainted to do.
Catching up · The USC offensive line, in white here, is not yet up to speed in practice this spring. The Trojans practiced with only six available linemen Tuesday because of a variety of injuries that have sidelined members of the line. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
“We’re just starting to mesh as a unit,” redshirt junior tackle Matt Kalil said. “We’re still getting all of our plays down, but I think we’re a lot better than we were on day one.”
Kalil and company’s coordination problems became most evident in zone running drills. Zone blocking requires the line to move up the field at an angle as a unit.  The synchronized push forward and to the side should stretch the defense and create seams between defenders. If the line moves together, you should see tailbacks C.J. Gable or Allen Bradford sauntering across Howard Jones Field. If the line breaks, you will likely see junior defensive end Armond Armstead in the backfield chewing on ball carriers like Pac-Man.
Fortunately for the line, coach Lane Kiffin runs a familiar offensive system. The Trojans’ new head coach worked with the USC offense for six seasons (2001-2006) under Pete Carroll, including a stint as offensive coordinator in 2005 and 2006. Trojan fans can expect more of the same pro-style attack in 2010.
“The plays are mostly the same,” junior tackle Tyron Smith said. “It’s just the names that are different. We have to switch those up in our heads, but otherwise it’s not too bad.”
—
Despite some setbacks in the running game, coach Kiffin was excited about the line’s progress Tuesday. The unit has continued to improve, and even impress, considering its dwindling numbers.
“It was a pretty decent practice,” said Kiffin. “I was really impressed with the offensive line.  We only had six offensive linemen today and they did well.”
Persistent injuries have limited the offensive and tested the Trojans depth in the trenches all spring.  Senior center Kris O’Dowd sat out with a two-week-old knee injury, and tight ends David Ausberry, Jordan Cameron and Rhett Ellison are still questionable.
“We don’t have a lot of guys,” Kalil admitted.  “There’s not a lot of depth right now, but the guys who are out here are all getting better.”
—
If injuries or inexperience aren’t the offensive line’s biggest problem, the defensive line might be.  Barkley was tagged by Armstead and senior defensive tackle Christian Tupou four times in a first team offense vs. first team defense two-minute drill, and forced senior quarterback Mitch Mustain to throw an interception with seconds left.
“The defensive line looks really good,” said Kalil. “[Defensive line coach Ed Orgeron] got them straightened out; they’re going to be the best defensive line in the nation. They’re just making us better as an o-line.” Orgeron was USC’s defensive line coach from 1998 to 2004, before taking over as head coach at Mississippi for three years (2005-2007), where he went 10-25.
—
The Trojans took a page out of Oregon’s playbook during the two-minute drill and mixed in some Wildcat formation, as well.  Freshman tailback Dillon Baxter, took a few snaps at quarterback.
“It’s something I’ve done at the last two places I coached (Oakland Raiders and the University of Tennessee), and so I wanted to try it here,” said Kiffin.  “It’s just an experiment. Maybe we’ll bring it out again some time.”  Kiffin may have to save his experiment for a passing situation.  Baxter managed only a few yards on the ground but did toss a 40-yard bomb out of the formation that left Barkley shaking his head.

Every commencement, he comes with his wife. There they are, taking pictures with dozens upon dozens of graduating seniors. It seems like almost everyone wants a picture with him, and who wouldn’t? Aside from Lane Kiffin and President Steven B. Sample, he’s probably the most popular guy on campus. He has Mark Sanchez on speed dial and feeds over 80 percent of the football team and coaching staff.
His name is Armando Corado, and he owns a lunch truck.
It’s amazing how he does it. Operating out of a truck that’s just slightly larger than the SUVs on today’s roads, Corado feeds over 400 people per day from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. His customers range from facilities workers and athletes to students and faculty. In an economy when most businesses are struggling to stay afloat, Armando’s has not only managed to sustain business, a feat unto itself, but it continues to grow. It gets new customers every week.
But what makes Corado’s success so remarkable is its location. You won’t find Armando’s in the three main student eateries: Everybody’s Kitchen, Parkside Restaurant or Café 84. You won’t even find it on a main walkway or in a prominent building. You’ll find it nestled next to a facilities service building among all the construction next to the new School of Cinematic Arts in an alley across from McDonald’s Swim Stadium. Most students pass by it everyday without realizing it. In fact, his business card doesn’t give an address, but rather says, “Best kept secret, ask around. You’ll find us.”
It is here that Pete Carroll and Taylor Mays used to eat breakfast almost everyday. It’s the same place that former USC football stars Lendale White, Carson Palmer and Sedrick Ellis ate as well. Nowadays, Matt Barkley is a frequent customer along with almost every varsity athlete on campus, it seems.
If you’re thinking, “How can I break into this place and eat the breakfast of champions?” — it’s pretty easy. You go up to the window and order “The Lendale.”
“I think a lot of athletes eat here because it’s really close to Heritage Hall, the prices are good and you don’t have to deal with too many people in line,” senior linebacker Malcolm Smith said.
Like most athletes, Smith and outgoing defensive end Everson Griffen started going to Armando’s when they were freshmen. They heard about it from other members of the football team who frequented the truck daily. Smith said during football season he goes to Armando’s about four to five times per week and always gets lunch from Armando’s as a pre-game ritual before the team leaves on Friday afternoon.
On a particular Friday before a home game last fall, Smith got “The Taylor” sandwich — a breakfast burrito. Many players have their own sandwich named after them. Corado doesn’t name the sandwiches, but rather the players come up with something unique and people start wanting whatever that player is having, so the name of the original maker of the sandwich is used.
For example, “The Lendale”  is one of the most popular breakfast sandwiches not only amongst athletes, but amongst students as well. It consists of bacon, sausage, egg, cheese, jelly, mayonnaise and a hash brown on sourdough bread. Corado said that Dominique Byrd, now the tight end for the Arizona Cardinals, came up with most of the sandwich, but White added the mayonnaise and hash brown and it’s stuck ever since.
“Everything goes around ‘The Lendale,’” Corado said. “People get it and switch the bread or switch something and call it their things. Sedrick Ellis used to get the same thing but on a French roll. One time I had Ellis and Lendale here and they wanted to make a bet about who started [the sandwich], but I had to be fair and say Byrd.”
Like Ellis, Barkley has his own spinoff of “The Lendale” that switches out the sourdough bread for a croissant.
Interestingly enough, the success of the athlete’s sandwiches depend on the athlete’s success on the field. During the beginning of the season, Sanchez had a few great games for the New York Jets. So, his spicy chicken burrito was a hot commodity that week.
“I got together with my wife and said, ‘Sanchez did great. We are probably going to sell a lot of Sanchez burritos.’ And that’s how it went.”
Because of the many athletes that eat at Armando’s on a regular basis, Corado has been able to forge lifelong relationships with them.
This includes former quarterback and top-five pick Sanchez, who came back in October during his NFL team’s bye week.
“He invited us to his draft party in May,” said Corado, who also went to a Jets game in December as a guest of Sanchez. “He’s become a friend of ours.”
Go find Armando. Maybe you too can get a picture with him at graduation.

Two strokes out of first place after two rounds, the No. 10 USC men’s golf team entered Tuesday’s final round at the Stanford U.S. Intercollegiate in contention for a championship for the third straight tournament.
Best effort · Freshman T.J. Vogel shot a final-round 69 Tuesday, but it wasn’t enough, as the Trojans finished fifth, 10 strokes behind Oregon. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
And for the third straight tournament, the Trojans could not put together a strong final round, finishing 10 strokes behind champions No. 6 Oregon and falling to a tie for fifth place at 9 over par at Stanford Golf Course in Palo Alto, Calif.
“We’ve seen signs every week that we’re turning into a pretty good team,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “It just doesn’t seem like we’ve been able to put up the final round that we needed or have four guys playing well.”
Playing in their final tournament before the Pac-10 championships April 26 to 28, USC finished behind conference foes Oregon, No. 6 Washington and No. 25 Oregon State.
“We started the day two shots back and when you’re in that position you want to go out and win,” junior Matthew Giles said. “So coming in tied for fifth is a little bit disappointing, but hopefully we can work out the things we need to improve for Pac-10s.”
Freshman T.J. Vogel turned in another solid performance for the Trojans, shooting 74-65-69 and placing in a tie for eighth, his third top-10 finish of the spring.
Giles carded 12 birdies on the week but also posted eight bogeys and two double bogeys, shooting 70-70-70 to finish in a tie for 16th.
“I did some things really well, but I just made far too many mistakes for the week,” Giles said. “Hopefully, I can eradicate them going forward.”
Freshman Martin Trainer enjoyed a homecoming of sorts, shooting 75-68-69 to finish tied for 19th on a course where he grew up playing.
“He had a really nice week,” Zambri said of Trainer. “He played two really good rounds for us, and we’re stoked to see that.”
Sophomore Steve Lim, who had been a model of consistency for the Trojans, shot 69-73-77 and placed in a tie for 44th, his lowest finish of the spring.
To make matters worse, Lim injured his wrist while hitting a ball out of the rough on his first hole of Tuesday’s final round. Lim finished the round and will have his wrist evaluated by a trainer Wednesday.
“I tried to punch out and I ended up hitting it really fat,” Lim said. “It kind of grabbed and I jammed my wrist. It hurt right away.”
Redshirt junior Bo DeHuff, who is battling freshman Stewart Hagestad for the Trojans’ fifth spot, shot 78-80-77 and placed 97th.
Hagestad, competing as an individual, fared better, shooting 74-76-74 and placing tied for 72nd.
USC will need six golfers for the expanded format of the Pac-10 championships later this month in Tempe, Ariz. With five scores counting in each round, the Trojans’ depth will be tested, especially if Lim’s injury is serious.
“I haven’t had a serious injury in my life, and if this is one, it’s trouble,” Lim said. “Playing without me would put us in a terrible position. I hope it’s just a minor strain where I could play golf.”

The USC School of Social Work will hold a memorial service Wednesday to remember Jennifer Paek, a Ph.D. candidate who died in New York last Wednesday.
Remembered · Jennifer Paek (right), pictured here with a friend, was studying  health disparity and policy at USC’s School of Social Work. - Photo courtesy of Young Sun Lee.  (Corrected 4/14/2010 to reflect the correct identification of Paek.)
The service for Paek, who was in her second year at USC, will be held at 7:30 p.m. in the Social Work Center Gabilan Courtyard.
“She was just a really, really beautiful person,” said Minah Kim, Paek’s close friend and classmate in the Ph.D. program. “So many people were surrounded by Jennifer’s love.”
Paek was born in New York on October 7, 1979, but was raised in Southern California. She received a bachelor’s degree in Asian American studies from UCLA before moving on to receive a master’s of social welfare from the same school.
“She was very passionate about learning, education and educating as a social worker,” Kim said.
In her doctoral work at USC, Paek focused on health disparities, health policy, case advocacy for vulnerable populations and end-of-life care. According to Prisca Wu, who has been friends with Paek since high school, Paek was heavily involved in the community and focused on advocating for people without a voice.
“She was already taking care of people before the social worker program,” Wu said. “She was always looking to see how she could make things better for other people.”
The owner of two dogs, Paek combined her passion for social work with her love of animals in her veterinary hospital social work project, said Brooklyn Levine, who developed the program with Paek.
The program established a philosophy of caring for an animal and its guardian or family to best serve both their needs and outcomes.
“Jennifer wanted to alleviate the strain on professionals doing good work in a difficult economy and create new jobs in an unexplored niche in Los Angeles,” Levine said in a written reflection about Paek.
Friends said Paek was caring, warm and generous and had a great sense of humor.
“She was really thoughtful and [was] always talking about you,” Wu said. “[She] put herself way last and would remember specific things about your life.”
Paek was known for putting together care packages for her classmates during midterms or finals, Kim said.
“She was like a big sister to me,” Kim said. “Because I’m international, she was always correcting my English … She told me what restaurant is better for me [and] where to go for sightseeing.”
Wu echoed this sentiment.
“She just had such a way of including all her friends into her life,” Wu said. “By extension, all of her friends were like a family.”
According to The Brooklyn Paper, a local newspaper in New York, Paek died after jumping from the roof of the 51-story building she lived in. The paper reported that Paek had left suicide notes in the apartment she shared with her husband.
Paek is survived by her parents Chung Ja and Nam Paek and her husband, Luis Diaz.
Correction: Jennifer Paek was originally identified in the photo caption as the woman on the left, but is the woman on the right.

Sources close to USC basketball told the Los Angeles Times Monday that no one on the Trojan staff has ever contacted Rutgers guard Mike Rosario.
Reports out of New Jersey said that Rutgers was on the verge of filing a tampering charge against the university over contacting Rosario about a possible transfer.
Rosario’s high school teammate and current USC guard Jio Fontan transferred to USC after starting his collegiate career with Fordham in New York.
Rutgers’ campus newspaper, the Daily Targum, is reporting that Rosario will not be returning to the Scarlet Knights, but it is unclear what the effect of the tampering allegations will have on Rosario’s transfer options. The newspaper is also reporting that North Carolina may be an option for the sophomore guard.
The Scarlet Knights are in a period of transition, as they are in talks with current coach Fred Hill, Jr. concerning  a buyout of his remaining contract.
In his two seasons with the Scarlet Knights, Rosario averaged 16.5 points and 3.7 rebounds per game.

Every end has a beginning.
That’s the tagline for Coheed and Cambria’s fifth studio album, Year of the Black Rainbow, and it fits. Serving as the prequel to the band’s series of concept albums — a five-part saga called “The Amory Wars” — Year of the Black Rainbow tells the story of the fictional universe of the Keywork and a grand war for control of it.
The broken · Coheed and Cambria’s latest album serves as a prequel to its last four releases. The entire storyline is called “The Amory Wars.” - Photo courtesy of Columbia Records 
Although it is a concept album, Year of the Black Rainbow also features more accessible themes for casual listeners who aren’t necessarily familiar with Coheed and Cambria’s discography. If the band’s previous album, Good Apollo, I’m Burning Star IV Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow, was driven by the loss of a loved one, Year of the Black Rainbow runs with the theme of a romance destroyed by self doubt and insecurity.
For fans of the band, the album is another great installment of what they have come to expect from Coheed and Cambria. Singer Claudio Sanchez combines his crooning falsetto with low choruses for each song, showing off his impressive range as a vocalist.
Dueling guitar lines between Sanchez and lead guitarist Travis Stever still impress, and the band continues to create some of the most unique and complex songs out there.
None of this is to say the new album is more of the same. Though Year of the Black Rainbow doesn’t necessarily represent a complete stylistic shift for the band, there is definitely a sense of progress.
Despite its clear status as a progressive rock album, the band’s previous release, No World for Tomorrow, had a very raw edge to its content and subject matter. Year of the Black Rainbow, however, features more experimentation and a stronger sense of influence from other genres. Elements of punk rock, acoustic and even some world music infiltrate Coheed and Cambria’s sound on the new album.
Starting with melodic chords and haunting background strains, the first track, fittingly called “One,” is another mood-setting album opener fans of the band have come to expect. The song builds slowly, eventually reaches a crescendo and segues into the second track “The Broken.” Like the band’s previous second tracks, the song’s epic tone elevates the lyrics to a grander scale.
The next track highlights some of the new sounds of the album. With a pacing unlike that of any other song on the rest of the album, “Guns of Summer” features an amazing guitar solo and a definite sense of evolution in Sanchez’s vocals.
The song “Far” shows off the band’s softer side. With apparent new wave sensibilities, “Far” quickly catches the listener’s attention and is definitely one of the highlights of Year of the Black Rainbow.
“World of Lines” is much more complex, but its in-your-face, almost punk rock pacing and catchy chorus make it one of the best songs on the album. It is slightly reminiscent of the end of their earlier song, “Blood Red Summer,” but with the greater complexity that generally characterizes Year of the Black Rainbow.
The album’s primary themes culminate in two songs near the end of the record. “Pearl of the Stars” is the requisite ballad on the album. A touching love song with a laid-back tempo and acoustic feels, “Pearl of the Stars” sums up the romantic angle of the album. Though soft, the song builds to a powerful final reprise, memorable enough to stick with listeners long after the song is over.
If “Pearl of the Stars” is the summation of the album’s love theme, “In the Flame of Error” is the climax of the self-destruction motif. Dark, passionate and filled with subtle but complex guitar lines, it’s a great complement to the previous song and is itself another highlight of the album.
The deluxe edition of Year of the Black Rainbow also comes with a DVD and a 352-page novel. The DVD features behind-the-scenes footage of the recording of the album and is filled with revealing interviews with the band. The novel, co-written by Sanchez and noted comic book writer and novelist Peter David, offers a prose retelling of the story already related in the album.
With only five albums to its name, Coheed and Cambria has already established a high standard for itself, not only meeting the quality of the previous installment but exceeding it.
Year of the Black Rainbow is a testament to the band’s growth and the members’ skills as musicians.

From battered apples to mangled cabbage, Superior Grocers is not a hotspot for great produce. Ralphs has better quality, but woe to the student who doesn’t check the price until the register.
For USC students, however, this barren plane of near-campus veggies does not go on forever. Since February, USC has had its own vegetable drop-off program. For just $15 per week, students can get a box loaded with organic, fresh vegetables, support local agriculture and have an excuse for a nostalgic visit to Trojan Grounds.
Community-supported agriculture is a concept that has been utilized in cities across the United States. Similar to co-ops, CSA works with local farmers to bring their produce to people that buy shares of the farmers’ produce for the season.
It’s a win-win situation: The buyer gets cheap, fresh vegetables all season while the farmer can guarantee a percentage of sold crops.
USC’s activity, however, works a little differently. While many CSAs pull from a group of approved local farms, the produce for USC comes from the South Central Farmers Cooperative, an urban farm whose history was documented in the Oscar-nomintated film The Garden.
And instead of requiring customers to pay for the entire growing season, the South Central Farmers allows them to pay for their boxes on a week-by-week basis. For students, this means as many or as few monster veggie boxes as desired.
To receive a week’s worth of vegetables, all you have to do is place an order online before Monday at 5 p.m., and every Wednesday, the boxes are dropped off in front of Birnkrant Residental College for pickup. That’s it. All I had to do was check my name off a list and somehow cram 10 different kinds of greens into my refrigerator.
The process might sound easy, but getting the vegetables to come to campus wasn’t as simple.
It took Jessi Schoner, an employee at the Marshall School of Business, almost a year to get USC its own drop-off site.
She first got the idea from UCLA’s similar setup, and after hearing a talk by the environmentalist-philosopher Vandana Shiva, she enlisted the help of her boyfriend and various USC students to bring the veggies to campus. She definitely considers the CSA site worth it.
“It brings you closer to the seasons,” Schoner said. “In Los Angeles this is what is supposed to be growing. You can taste the difference.”
Besides the warm fuzzies achieved from knowing you’re helping local farmers, buying from a CSA drop-off has its advantages. The vegetables are fresh — not supermarket standard fresh, but “picked just before your morning coffee” fresh. Because of this, they last longer.
When properly stored, local vegetables will outlast any grocery store counterpart, which is good for those who don’t always cook their own food.
Some might think $15 sounds like a lot for a box of vegetables, but in reality, this behemoth box is easily big enough for two people to cook all their own meals. An apartment of four roomates who sometimes eat out could even split it four ways.
Farm-fresh veggies for $7.50 or $3.75 a week? Superior Grocers can keep its puny bunches of spinach.
If there is a downside to the CSA, it is that it might scare off those not as well acquainted with their veggies. This week’s box had, among other things, red Russian kale, dinosaur kale, Swiss chard, red romaine lettuce and Detroit red beets. Each item, from peppery mustard greens to crunchy sweet carrots, was at its peak of freshness and taste.
So you have a huge box of quasi-identifiable greens sitting in your living room. What do you do with them?
For Schoner, this is the fun part. She and her boyfriend are fond of soups and stir-fries. Recently, she made her own beet and apple chutney.
For a simple side dish, take a bunch of greens and sauté them in garlic and olive oil. Season with salt, pepper and a dash of basil, and you have a restaurant-quality side dish.
Greens add tons of flavor to omelets and egg scrambles. When mixed with docile greens such as romaine or spinach, a few leaves of curly mustard or dinosaur kale add sass to any salad. You are limited only by your own creativity — or lack of Google skills.
USC’s CSA drop-off makes it as easy as possible for students to enjoy fresh, local and cheap produce.
Stick with Superior Grocers for milk and toilet paper, but leave the produce to the farmers.

Where is the drop off site at USC located? And on what days can I come pick up? This is great!
I frequently order from this CSA and the vegetables are always fresh and tasty.  This is also a great way to support your local farmers.

Phyllis and Harold Kleine were married 59 years. For nearly six decades, Harold believed his marriage was the best thing that ever happened to him. Unbeknownst to him, his wife believed the exact opposite. Chronicled through old home videos and interviews complied by their daughter, filmmaker Cindy Kleine, Phyllis and Harold is a train wreck of a film about a train wreck of a marriage.
Marital bliss · Using old family videos, Phyllis and Harold tells the story behind the seemingly happy marriage of the filmmaker’s parents.  - Photo courtesy of Cindy Kleine 
The film begins quaintly enough with footage that makes you feel as if you are watching old home videos of your own parents or grandparents. But then after about 15 minutes of seemingly the same video, you realize these aren’t your family members and you could really care less about their old photos and home movies.
As the film progresses, you finally delve into what appears to be the plot of the film. Harold marries Phyllis for love. Phyllis marries Harold because “it was time” to get out of her parents’ house. In one-on-one interviews conducted later in her life, she describes her marriage as a game of musical chairs with Harold being the chair she landed in when the music stopped.
Because Phyllis viewed her marriage as a game of chance, she felt justified in her decision to begin an affair within her first year of marriage. The man she chose was her boss, a married man eight years her senior. He eventually left his wife and terminally ill son, but Phyllis ended their affair.
The affair was kept secret until the younger Kleine, the director, writer and producer of the film, had her first love at age 18. Phyllis took this inopportune, premature time to tell her daughters, including Cindy’s sister Ricky, about her liaison.
The daughters were furious with their mother — not because she was unfaithful to their father, not because her boss was married, and not because she was still thinking about her ex-lover. They were furious because she didn’t continue the affair.
The daughters then team up to reunite the adulterous couple. They track down her former boss, they buy their mother a post office box so the two can correspond and then feed their father elaborate excuses as to their mother’s whereabouts. They also do something of utmost incomprehensibility — they let their mother and her lover use their apartments as honeymoon suites.
A few times, Ricky told Harold she and Phyllis were going to a press conference out of town. Instead, Phyllis would fly across the country to visit her lover and Ricky would lock herself in her apartment, unable to leave or answer her phone for an entire weekend. These are the lengths they endured to facilitate their mother’s affair.
“The enemy: My father. The weapon: Secrets,” Cindy said.
The sisters went through a lot to make sure their mother could have sex with another man. The film, therefore, is intended to be sympathetic to Phyllis’ case. The director wants the audience to feel that she and her sister were doing the right thing and, somehow, Harold is to blame.
Harold — the man who describes his wife as a “terrific woman” and says he was lucky to be married to Phyllis; the man who was “absolutely, always” sure he married the right person — this is the man the film attempts to blame.
The sisters complained how difficult it was to sneak their mother out of the house because Harold paid all the bills and would ask about calls, mail or missing sums. In this way, the film attempts to frame Harold as overbearing, constricting and tyrannical. Overbearing for questioning excessive withdrawals from their joint bank account? Constricting for questioning multiple calls from across the country? Tyrannical for questioning mail addressed to his wife from an unknown male? If I was Harold, I might be suspicious my wife was cheating on me.
Oddly, not once was the word “divorce” used in the film. Apparently, it was much easier to have an affair and make a film about it. Fortunately, for the filmmaker, her father died sooner than expected — he choked on a pork chop Phyllis cooked for him.
Apart from the disgusting content of the film, the formal elements were just as horrendous. There are lengthy asides that do nothing to further the story. For instance, an entire segment on the Kliene family’s nanny unfortunately frames the poor woman in such a way that furthers the stereotype of the African-American maid.
Even worse than this insensitive portion is the multitude of incoherent animation abstractions. Random cutouts from old photographs are set against new backgrounds and scenes that were not captured are drawn in haphazard cartoons that are as odd as they are unnecessary.
For example, the director describes how she was in the bathtub when she learned of her father’s sudden death. To illustrate this, she felt it necessary to insert an animation of painted toenails in a bubble bath. The toes sank into the bubbles when she heard the news. This tasteless interpretation epitomizes the lack of tact and respect present throughout the film.
The distracting formal elements and disturbing content ultimately combine to create the worst film you’ll never see. Hopefully, the director is proud of herself for her manipulation of her parent’s lives in hopes of furthering her filmmaking career. At least the film-watching public can rest easy that Cindy Kleine only has one set of parents to defame and make terrible films about.

Last winter break, an executive manager of a large, highly respected hospital in South Dakota jokingly told me “you are more likely to be killed by misdiagnosis from your family doctor than by your anesthesiologist.”
Aside from the specialists, most of the doctors at the University Park Health Center are in family practice, trained to see patients for a wide range of issues and extend referrals to specialists.
Though it may be a stretch to think all students believe family doctors will kill them, there does appear to be something that makes them shun UPHC visits at all costs. With a health insurance program that requires students to visit the UPHC first for primary care, USC should mend the broken bond between students and university health services to further the reliability of services which many students depend on.
Some students have reported experiencing poor treatment and misdiagnoses at our UPHC.
Alia Alanizi, a sophomore majoring in political science, recalls her experience during the swine flu season: She felt many intense swine flu symptoms and waited at the UPHC for an hour before seeing a physician assistant — not a doctor.
The P.A. did not offer any medicine or diagnosis but said it was not swine flu. She was instructed to go home and come back once she “felt like Jack Nicholson, wearing sunglasses and unable to get out of bed.”
About two years ago, an illness swept through my fraternity house. More than half the people living in the house began vomiting incessantly in a matter of three days. We ruled out food poisoning since we all maintained different diets.
Four students experiencing the same symptoms went to the UPHC together. The medical staff treating each individual were in communication with one another. They were aware of each student’s equivalent illness.
Yet everyone received a different diagnosis: One of the four supposedly had food poisoning; another had a bacterial infection; yet another viral infection.
They all stayed for additional testing. I was the fourth — they told me I was completely healthy and sent me home.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
After hearing these stories of poor treatment, I sought an explanation.
To my encouragement, I found that UPHC hires a top-quality medical staff, many coming from respectable institutions such as Columbia, UCLA and USC. The UPHC pays its medical staff a very competitive salary, comparable to other campus health centers and university medical centers like UC Irvine and UCLA.
I also found that our health center does not practice any Kaiser-Permanente HMO referral or lab-testing practices, meaning it does not have any sort of quota system or pay incentive to undertreat patients.
The UPHC has high standards in practices and employment, so there is no systemic issue facing our students.
Maybe there is a real issue with the UPHC — or maybe the problem is a product of groupthink, where one student complains and it becomes trendy. But either way, USC should remedy the ill student-UPHC relationship.
Studies show there is a high negative correlation between grade point average and general primary care illnesses.
If students avoid receiving primary care at UPHC, they can extend the duration of their sickness, which hurts their attendance, learning and performance in class. Also, contagions have greater power to spread with the more number of sick days a student experiences.
According to one source, 70 percent of employers report using a GPA cutoff for recruitment. Beyond the cutoff, there seems to be little effect, but if a student incessantly battles the flu during the college career without pursuing primary treatment, the student might end up with a GPA below competitive job cutoffs.
However, USC can still act to improve the care and relieve students’ concerns. The university should employ some publicly accessible quality assurance program, perhaps along the lines of the Joint Commission’s quality assurance guidelines.
This way, the medical staff would rightfully be accountable for its own actions. Also, students would be able to read testimonies and be assured of the quality of the treatments.
Hopefully, the university will overcome students’ concerns with the UPHC in order to offer its students every opportunity to succeed in their USC career.

The final stretch of spring semester is here, unofficially coinciding with a dramatic surge in the number of all-nighters on campus.
Popular research in neuroscience reveals that sleep deprivation can cause a euphoric experience, which can alleviate depression or simply cause better, sprightlier moods. After reviewing images of the brain, the late Dr. J. Christian Gillin, a renowned sleep specialist and professor of psychiatry at UCSD, saw a specific frontal area of the cerebral cortex — termed the anterior cingulate cortex, which is overactive in depressed patients — had normal levels of activity when those patients were sleep-deprived.

But such a discovery stands to combat the serious side effects of sleep deprivation. Students should be better educated about the harmful effects of voluntary insomnia.
One serious side effect is the ability to maintain normal cognitive and motor performance in class, at work and even in everyday life. In fact, just 10 years ago, a study done by A. M. Williamson and Anne-Marie Feyer demonstrated prolonged sleep deprivation is equivalent, if not worse, to consuming large amounts of alcohol — 17 to 19 hours without sleep can be the equivalent of a blood alcohol content of .05 percent. In general, sleep deprivation causes a reduction in performance and alertness.
WebMD reports that reducing your nighttime sleep by one and a half hours reduces alertness during the daytime by 32 percent, significantly affecting participation in class, extracurricular activities and even social activities.
Sleep deprivation increases blood pressure and stress hormone levels, making it difficult for your body to process blood sugar and reducing an important appetite-depressing hormone.
Deprivation could form problems with metabolism and weight, especially important for college students intent on maintaining a good body image. It is even more dangerous because research has shown a significant correlation between deprivation and serious medical problems — including obesity, psychiatric problems such as depression or mood imbalances, high blood pressure, heart attack, heart failure and even stroke.
It’s especially important to note that sleep deprivation causes an adverse affect on the immune system. So, during those semesters when everyone has been catching that illness, even something as common as the flu, there is a good possibility that your body’s lack of sleep might impair its ability to fight it off.
While I’m glad to note that my all-nighters can bring me some short-lived delirious joy, I fear that the overall health risks are too big to take.
However, the life of a college student, from studying for exams to writing essays to reading assigned texts (to even doing this article), as well as juggling extracurricular activities, community groups, meetings and jobs (not to mention maintaining a social life), sleep is the last on the list.
“In college, you can only do two of three things: have a social life, do well academically and sleep,” said Neil Bhattacharya, a freshman majoring in biology and health policy and management.
To sleep or not to sleep — that is the question.
Balancing a busy schedule seems to be a part of the college experience, but we should be mindful of the consequences of our decisions.

With the NFL draft less than two weeks away, former USC defensive end Everson Griffen’s draft stock is continuing to rise.
Griffen spent his junior season in the Cardinal and Gold chasing down the best offensive players in the Pac-10.
The junior defensive end was named to the second All-Pac-10 team at the end of a productive season, and decided that chasing down NFL offenses would be his next step.
After declaring for the draft after USC’s 24-13 victory over Boston College in the 2009 Emerald Bowl, Griffen was immediately tabbed as one of the best prospects at the defensive end position, which includes Georgia Tech’s Derrick Morgan and Florida’s Carlos Dunlap.
After recently working out with the Atlanta Falcons and impressing at the NFL’s scouting combine, Griffen seems to be a lock to go in the first round, the only question is where.
ESPN draft analysts Mel Kiper and Todd McShay having differing opinions on Griffen’s placement in the first round, but both agree that he’ll go somewhere in the mid-to-late first round.
McShay currently sees Griffen going 22ndoverall to the New England Patriots, saying that the Patriots would benefit from his pass-rush ability and size.
Kiper has Griffen a little further down the list at No. 29 to the New York Jets and also views Griffen as a good prospect, comparing him favorably to current pros Adalius Thomas and Terrell Suggs.

As cliché as it is, it still happens — books are unfortunately judged by their covers. And from the growing pool of Susan Boyle-born foreign reality TV shows, a clip of Taiwanese male singer Lin Yu Chun has become viral due to this exact state of mind.
Wearing a tuxedo outfitted with a red bow tie and sporting a bowl cut as well as an innocently cherubic face, no one suspected Lin of being able to perfectly reproduce the ridiculous range of the one-and-only Whitney Houston. But, oh boy.
Closing your eyes while watching the video, it’s easy to imagine either the real Houston, or some other extraordinarily talented female imitation. But Chun breaks gender roles and sings the song better than many female singers who have covered the famous track, and hits notes that even high-pitch-capable women cannot possibly hit.
Popeater.com remarks that not since Susan Boyle has there “been such a talent” as this young man. And indeed, it seems the talent of both Boyle and Lin are even more shocking due to their seemingly average-joe apperances. But Chun outdid Boyle’s impressive rendition of “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Misérables in his refusal to let the obvious gender of the original artist stop him from delivering a captivating rendition of the song.
Lin’s video went viral last Tuesday and before the weekend had already been viewed 5 million times. While the video is definitely a unique YouTube experience, it unfortunately reiterates the tendency of society to associate talent with beauty. Indeed, most celebrities need to maintain a good image in order to garner more fans, but singers like Chun and Boyle break this stereotype, removing the thick layers of makeup and glitzy costumes associated with performance artists and opting to catching viewers’ attention with straight-up skills.

If T-Pain’s brief performance at Springfest didn’t quite satisfy your appetite for music, then Chinatown has something a bit more substantial to offer — in vinyl.
Sunday was the second annual Los Angeles Beat Swap Meet in Downtown Chinatown. Audiophiles of all ages were invited to attend a celebration of music at the Grandstar Jazz Club from noon until 6 p.m. The event featured live performances and a bar for those lucky visitors who met the age requirement. More than 30 record vendors and collectors were invited to share their ware.
The stock was impressive, with blues, disco, funk, hip hop, jazz, punk, reggae, rock and foreign music. Hip hop was alive and thriving upstairs, with Beat Swap Meet’s first ever D.J. showdown. Outside the club, independent vendors and designers gathered to sell their goods to an enthusiastic audience.
Chinatown is chock full of events for the musically inclined and artistically curious, if one only bothers to seek them out. I had an enjoyable afternoon at the cozy venue and hope to come back in the future.
One of the best parts of the event is the charitable aspect: As long as they bring donations of canned food to the event, people of all ages may attend free of charge. All other donations are encouraged in the name of helping the homeless community in Los Angeles. The Grandstar Jazz Club is located on 943 N. Broadway.
