Former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly, a U.S. Navy captain and astronaut, spoke about the intersection of public service and faith at Town and Gown on Sunday evening.
The event was hosted by the USC Casden Institute for the Study of the Jewish Role in American Life as the 14th annual Carmen and Louis Warschaw Distinguished Lecture. In attendance were local California politicians, including Congressman Ted Lieu of the 33rd District of California and the mayor of West Hollywood, John D’Amico.
The event began with a welcome by the co-director of the Casden Institute, Steve Ross, and an introduction to the speakers by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts, and Sciences Dean Steve Kay.
“For more than a decade, this lecture series has allowed us to impart a message that politics is not necessarily separate from faith, and in fact, that the tenets of Judaism have in so many cases impelled great politicians to work even harder to create the change they believe is necessary,” Kay said.
Kelly, who was the commander on the final flight of the space shuttle Endeavor, spoke about the assassination attempt made on Giffords’ life on Jan. 8, 2011, while she was visiting constituents in Tucson, Arizona.
“When Gabby entered Congress in 2007, I thought I had the risky job. I’d flown 39 combat missions. I’d flown two flights into space already at that point in my career. But as it would turn out, Gabby is the one who would nearly lose her life serving her country,” Kelly said.
Giffords had been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, serving three terms as the representative of Arizona’s 8th District. She was the third woman in Arizona history to be elected to Congress. From the beginning of her career in the House, Giffords set her focus on illegal immigration and health care reform. After the attempted assassination, she officially resigned from office to focus on her recovery process.
Since the shooting, Giffords and Kelly have founded a political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, in response to the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary. The PAC supports gun control measures at the federal level.
Kay complimented the strength Giffords has demonstrated through her continued dedication to political reform.
“Congresswoman Giffords has chosen to make her own pain secondary to showing compassion for people who have been victims of gun violence and being proactive to protect those who may be in the future,” Kay said.
Though Gifford has recovered some of her ability to speak, write and walk since the shooting, it is still difficult for her to do so. At the end of her husband’s explanation of their journey through the recovery process, she briefly addressed the audience.
“It’s been a long, hard haul, but I’m getting better. I’m working hard on lots of therapy – speech therapy, physical therapy and yoga, too – but my spirits are strong as ever. I’m still fighting to make the world a better place,” Giffords said.
Community members, alumni and current students also attended the event. Jacob Lokshin, a freshman studying history and international relations who attended the lecture, was interested in the role Kelly has played in Giffords’ life and recovery.
“He’s a really interesting guy, and I was really fascinated by all of the things he’s done in his life, especially all the stuff about him in the military. It was really interesting to hear about him,in addition to the way he works with Gabrielle Giffords and obviously all that she’s accomplished,” Lokshin said.
Hearing Giffords speak also impacted Kealia Hudson, an undecided freshman.
“It was really inspiring when she came on. I teared up a little bit. I’m honestly still processing it,” Hudson said.

The UNITE HERE Local 11 Union announced they had reached a tentative contract agreement with the USC administration on Mar. 6. The union represents USC Hospitality and Auxiliary workers.
The agreement has to be ratified by workers before it will take effect, per communications representative Ofelia Carrillo. A vote will take place all day Thursday and parts of Friday, and the count will take place the evening of the latter.
This resolution will come after a series of rallies and protests supported by the Local 11 union and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation (SCALE), which both seek to raise USC workers’ low wages and allocate full time hours. The most recent of these demonstrations mobilized hundreds around Tommy Trojan on Feb. 5. The rally followed the posting of a YouTube video that showed a USC worker confronting President C. L. Max Nikias about low wages.
According to the union campaign, “Let’s Raise SC!” the average USC worker earns $18,800 a year. USC has not confirmed that number. Workers have expressed that the rising cost of living in L.A. has forced them to live in high-crime neighborhoods, face the threat of homelessness and prevented them from purchasing basic necessities.
UPDATE: This post was updated to include information that the agreement would be voted on by hospitality workers at the end of the week.

Thirty-two students selected by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute participated in the Joseph R. Cerrell Seminar in Political Leadership in Sacramento from March 5 to March 7.
The Cerrell Seminar, an annual spring conference sponsored and organized by the Unruh Institute, provides students who have demonstrated a significant interest in politics with an opportunity to meet with state’s leaders in politics, government and public policy.
Every year, students are selected through a competitive application process that consists of a written application with essays on topics that will be addressed during the seminar, faculty recommendation letters and prior political involvement.
Joseph R. Cerrell, longtime political consultant and the first director of the Unruh Institute, created the trip to Sacramento in the 1970s. Cerrell passed away in 2010, and the seminar was renamed in his honor.
In the past, the seminar was done in conjunction with other Southern California schools, but leaders from the Unruh Institute found that meeting with a political or government leader alongside 200 other students doesn’t allow for much personal interaction.
“We decided to separate from the other schools so USC students would be able to spend more time getting to know the people they are meeting with instead of just hearing speeches from them,” said Dan Schnur, executive director of the Unruh Institute.
Schnur oversees the entire program, but the Unruh Institute staff produces the day-to-day events included in the seminar. Laura Hill, deputy director of the Unruh Institute, has taken the lead in putting together the agenda and the program. Schnur has worked with most of the leaders invited to the seminar and asks them to participate and speak to the students.
Prior to leaving for Sacramento, the Unruh Institute held a session on campus to prepare for the trip. Last week, the students heard from California Secretary of State Alex Padilla. In past years, they have heard from former California State Treasurer Bill Lockyer and Harold Steinberg, a law professor at UCLA.
This year students had the opportunity to interact with policy directors from both the Republican and the Democratic state senate caucus, the state’s chief legislative analyst, several political journalists who cover state government and state politics, several political consultants from both parties, a group of the state’s most influential female political leaders and a group of young political leaders who have already held substantial roles in politics and government.
The overall goal for the trip was to give students a chance to understand and learn about state politics and government directly from leaders who work within the state.
“First, we want the students not just to read about the state’s most important policy and political challenges, we want them to engage in conversations with the people who make those petitions,” Schnur said. “Second, we also want the students to be exposed to people who have succeeded in these fields.”
“My favorite part was getting to hear from the governor’s staff,” said Jenny Di, a sophomore double majoring in policy, planning and development and economics. “I really enjoyed hearing all the different roles that they played in helping the state of California run and all the different kinds of positions available to somebody who’s interested in politics and public policy.”
As a result of the connections they made during this short trip, students who have participated in the program have gone on to work in politics and government in Sacramento, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.
“I think the best thing the seminar does is connect students to prominent leaders while teaching them and getting them more interested in politics and challenging them to think and to ask difficult questions,” said Nika Shahery, a sophomore double majoring in policy, planning and development and international relations.
Students also had a chance to network with policymakers during the dinner held on Friday night. All of the students and political leaders who participated in the panels come together over dinner. Each table is divided between students and political policy professionals and after every course, the professional guests switch tables so that the students get to meet as many of them as possible.
“It really gives you the opportunity to sit down at the dinner table with these top legislators and political figures in Sacramento one-on-one and sometimes in groups and get to know them on a much deeper level, both in terms of the professional context but also the social context,” said Eric Dubbury, a junior majoring in music industry. “It’s really a genuine time to network.”

More than 600 middle and high school students who have been recruited into the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program from several Los Angeles area schools competed for the annual USC MESA Day Science Competition, hosted by the Viterbi School of Engineering on Saturday.
MESA was founded as a pre-college program by Viterbi in the 1970s to help educationally disadvantaged students in the greater Los Angeles area succeed in school by participating in hands-on learning programs and interactive competitions. As one of the primary founders of MESA, Viterbi hopes to interest students in science and math-related subjects and encourage them to pursue STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering, and mathematics — when they graduate from high school.
The program targets specific high schools within 5 to 10 miles of the University Park campus. School participants include Alhambra High School, Belmont High School, Foshay Learning Center, Palisades Charter High School and South East High School. The majority of graduates from the MESA program have gone on to pursue science-related majors such as engineering and biology in college. Currently, it is estimated that there are a total of 1,200 high school students and 125 middle school students who participate in MESA.
Ben Louie, director of the MESA program and other Viterbi pre-college programs, emphasized that the objective of MESA is to help youth discover an interest in science, especially engineering.
“The goals of MESA Day is to excite students in science, technology, engineering, and math and to provide an opportunity for students to apply what they’ve learned in their classes in terms of concepts to real-world applications,” Louie said. “We make science fun, and we make math fun.”
During the MESA Day science preliminaries, students had the opportunity to compete in competitions that required them to use real-world applications in mathematics, science and engineering. All of the contest judgment criteria were aligned to California State Content Standards. Categories ranged from creating flying balsawood gliders and sliding mousetrap cars to modeling the human heart and the gastrointestinal tract.
The highlight of the MESA Day Preliminaries was the “Prosthetic Arm Challenge,” which incorporated concepts of life science and engineering. This contest challenged students to design, test and build a prosthetic arm that could pick up a beanbag and toss it into target zone. The arm had to be able to move different objects on a table into a crate.
Several contests during the preliminaries were hosted in various areas on campus including the Engineering Quad, Seeley G. Mudd Hall, Olin Hall of Engineering, Ronald Tutor Hall, Stauffer Science Lecture Hall, Salvatori Computer Science Center and Mudd Hall of Philosophy.
Members from different Viterbi organizations, including Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) and Society of Women Engineers (SWE), volunteered to judge competitions and guide the competing teams.
Leilani Rebolledo, community outreach and membership chair for SPE, said that her organization supports the event because MESA motivates and prepares local Los Angeles middle and high school students to pursue a higher degree of education in the STEM fields.
Rebolledo expressed her enthusiasm in making MESA Day a success. “[We] have expressed excitement to be able to positively influence and guide young students to discover the opportunities within the STEM fields,” Rebolledo said.
Many other organizations at USC also support MESA programs and events throughout the year.
“SPE has hosted interactive workshops on the Oil and Gas Industry for College Day, has held a panel of SPE members informing and inspiring students to pursue a higher degree of education, as well as aided with the MESA Engineering Symposium where SPE members mentored teams of middle school students on fun hands-on science activities,” Rebolledo said.
Panda Express is the sole sponsor of this year’s competition. Panda Express and its Panda Cares charity program has partnered with USC MESA for 15 years to promote the spirit of caring and giving. For MESA Day, Panda Express provided 25 employees from its company to judge the different competitions as well as lunch for all the attendees.
“Panda Express does this every single year and we’re grateful to have them as a partner; and without them we wouldn’t be able to bring in 700 high school kids and then feed them and run all of these different competitions,” Louie said.
High school students who won the preliminary rounds of MESA Day “Prosthetic Arm Challenge” will be moving on to the Senior MESA Day regional completion, which will also be hosted on the USC campus on April 25. The subsequent national competition will be held in Utah.

Four second-year law students went to the final round of the 66th Annual Hale Moot Court Honors Competition Saturday in Norris Theatre.
Students presented before a panel of three United States Circuit Court Judges and an audience consisting of their peers and professors. Law students Aja-Fullo Sanneh, Mary Alice DiPietro, Mark Swensson and Brittany Kitchen argued and defended their points on issues pertaining to computer fraud and fair labor standards.
The program, which aims to provide students with an opportunity to further develop their written and oral advocacy skills, kicks off every spring for first-year law students. Through a process that involves four eliminative qualifying rounds, participants are selected to advance in the competition based upon their oral and written skills in addition to their grade point averages.
The mission of the Moot Court competition is for participants to gain experience and confidence in the courtroom by presenting their own appellate briefs and engaging in oral arguments before judges and practicing attorneys. The program is one of Gould’s School of Law’s most prestigious honors programs, and to advance in the competition is a process that is both lengthy and difficult.
Each spring, all first-year students are invited to compete in qualifying rounds of the competition. They familiarize themselves with a fictional case that involves two issues; each student who chooses to participate in the program drafts an appellate brief on behalf of either the petitioner or respondent regarding one issue. In the fall, 40 of these now second-year students are selected to attend issue and oral advocacy clinics in preparation for the preliminary rounds, during which they present their arguments before panels consisting of state and federal judges, experienced attorneys and faculty members.
A student’s argument and appellate brief scores determine whether he or she is one of the 16 to advance to the quarterfinal round. The eliminating processes continue on to the semifinals, during which half of these 16 students are cut and then finally to the final round, in which only four of the original forty participants remain.
Though Sanneh, Dipietro, Swensson and Kitchen successfully weathered the many rounds of the Moot Court competition, ease was not something guaranteed in the final round. Yesterday’s case involved the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act, two matters of relevance that provided for a mock courtroom brimming with unpredictability and tension.
The U.S. Circuit Court judges who oversaw the case, Alex Kozinski, Reena Raggi and William Duane Benton, grilled the four students with a string of questions that they weren’t always prepared for.
Bobby Allen, a fellow second-year law students who sat in the audience, commended the efforts of his peers.
“I think the students all did well and were well-prepared, especially given the circumstances of such a hot bench,” Allen said. “Kozinsky is well known for grilling attorneys in open court and is often very entertaining at the attorney’s expense.”
The judges often fired quips and witty remarks to one another, letting their jokes balance with tough questions that surprised the competitors from time to time.
According to Allen, Moot Court participants do not get much information about the case they are taking on. The program, instead, is more concerned about the research and broader legal knowledge that each student possesses in order to adequately argue for his or her side in this specific case.
At the conclusion of the program, the recipient of the Edward G. Lewis Champion Award is contingent upon the student’s oral delivery. This year’s final prize was awarded to Mary Alice DiPetro, who argued on behalf of the petitioner’s side on the interpretation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The runner-up was Brittany Kitchen, who argued the opposing side.
Once the winner was chosen, the judges stepped out of their stern characters, congratulated each participant and offered constructive argumentative and career advice.
“Take a second to think about what the judge has asked,” Kozinsky said. “There’s nothing wrong with silence in a courtroom. Just like a page with all writing from edge to edge without white space is difficult to read, a readable page is one with white spaces. Silence actually punctuates your argument and gives you a chance to engage with a thoughtful discussion with the judges.”

A biblically inspired tale of heroism and a classic good-versus-evil plot line is what defines Leviathan as a shocking and inspiring new web series produced and directed by USC alumni and current students.
Cory Malkin, the show’s director and producer, describes Leviathan as a classic “good-versus-evil” story that takes place in a world parallel to our own.
Malkin, a sophomore majoring in critical studies, said the plot of Leviathan surrounds a girl who has the power to trigger events that will lead to the apocalypse — or Rapture, as it is known in biblical terms. The girl is fought over by two factions, the forces of heaven and hell, both with their own agendas for how they want to use her power. The twist lies in the motives of both the angels and demons, which contradict classical interpretations of what one would believe about the forces of heaven and hell.
“There was such a lack of originality in film and TV, with just reboots of the same few plot lines,” Malkin said.
Malkin and the team studied classic literature, including the Bible, to form their story line. This story is a modern twist on their interpretation of the Rapture and how it will be very real, a natural event, not the typical “earthquakes and hellfire” version, according to Malkin.
“Humanity is where the end of the world really lies, that’s where the divide starts, with us,” he said.
Despite the the biblically based plot, Malkin doesn’t believe that the show has overt ties to Christianity.
“We’re not really shooting for a religious demographic,” Malkin said.
He said that the story revolves around everyday life, with fantastical elements, something that any fan of the Lord of the Rings or science fiction would love.
Malkin provided the initial funds for the production of the pilot. Now that the series is finding success, they are able to explore the world of private investors to help fund their next endeavors with Leviathan. They have even started a campaign that raises money for the project by selling props from the set to fans.
Besides funds, projects of this size require a substantial cast and crew. To find their actors, Malkin explains that they simply put out a local casting call in Phoenix, where the series was shot.
To bring together a crew was a different story. Malkin tapped into his very talented group of colleagues and friends to pitch the story. Malkin was able to bring in some of the most talented young people to be a part of his project.
Brian Tang, a cinematic arts, film and television production production major, had a strong desire to work with Malkin from past knowledge of his work on other projects. When approached to do the project, he saw the perfect opportunity to take his cinematography skills, in conjunction with Malkin’s direction, to amazing new heights.
“I was really inspired by the skeleton of the story that Malkin gave me and I could really see how the project could be very visually creative. I knew I had something to bring to this project,” Tang said.
The show’s editor Michael Ritter, a junior majoring in cinematic arts, film and television production, said he was skeptical when first joining the project because he came from a less religious background than the others. He soon realized, however, that the story was much more than the religious references.
“The second he finished pitching it to me, I was like, ‘I’m in,’” Ritter said. “He doesn’t just foster a singular vision. Malkin really brings out this collaborative process which is honestly the most effective way of working with people.”
The team agreed that they owe their success to the passion and determination of all the cast and crew members.
“Through this project we found out that in this industry, it’s all about who you work with,” Malkin said.
He said the passion from the actors and the talent and collaboration from production crew such as Brian and Michael is why the project became so successful and fulfilling for all parties. Malkin explains that, in this business, if you don’t have a group of people invested in your project, it will fall flat with no creative insight or inspiration.
“We learned that this industry doesn’t need a studio or high-quality equipment, it’s all about the people and the passion and with that, all the puzzle pieces will fit together,” Tang said.
In terms of marketing this project, Malkin said that it all stemmed from social media. Especially in the early stages of the project, they publicized themselves through their Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages in order to spread the word about Leviathan and to acquire a following of devoted fans.
“We had our premiere a couple of weeks ago at a local station in Phoenix and the reception of the show and the turnout of fans was incredible,” Malkin said.
Despite the groundbreaking work done by such young students, one of the most important factors to this project is that it explores a new way of producing film and TV.
Malkin said that in the past, the idea of a web series has really been undermined in the film and television world. Now, with outlets such as Netflix or Amazon, however, there is an in-between for producers where nothing has happened yet. Malkin believes that in this new era of television production, the stage has been set for something original and groundbreaking, something like Leviathan, to take over this new “middle ground” of production in a new digital age.
“We’re trying to forge new grounds within an area that is different from the traditional way of receiving digital media. I think we’re breaking ground within this industry,” Malkin said.

After dropping its first two games of the season — one in heartbreaking, overtime fashion at the Coliseum on Feb. 7 to then-No. 5 Northwestern, 12-11, and the other in a low-scoring 7-4 affair with Stony Brook in New York on Feb. 21 — the USC women’s lacrosse program has successfully whipped a 180-degree turn.
Following the loss to Stony Brook, the Women of Troy rallied for an 11-7 win over Marist on Feb. 22 to secure a split on their New York trip before returning home for their first conference game of the season at McAlister Field on Feb. 24 against Fresno State. Despite the short rest and long travel, the team put together a wire-to-wire game and won by a wide 17-6 margin in front of its home crowd. The impressive collective showing was highlighted by a record-breaking individual performance from sophomore midfielder Michaela Michael, who set an MPSF conference single-match record with 15 draw controls.
USC now sets its sights on Liberty University, who will visit Southern California from Lynchburg, Virginia. The Women of Troy have had ample time to prepare since their previous game — nearly two weeks — a stretch that head coach Lindsey Munday feels has been beneficial for the team.
“This two-week break has really been great for us,” she said. “It has given us the opportunity to get back to the basics and have some really intense competition in practice, where we have been getting better at things that we saw needed improvement after our first couple games.”
Despite opening the season with five-straight home games, Liberty enters Monday’s matchup with a record of just 1-4. The Lady Flames have struggled defensively thus far, surrendering an average of 16.4 goals per game while scoring a respectable but significantly lower 10.8 goals per game.
The Women of Troy match up very well on with Liberty on offense, currently averaging  10.75 goals per game. Defensively, USC has been taut, however, giving up just eight goals a game despite playing two of their four matches so far against opponents that are currently ranked in the top-20 of the IWLCA Coaches Poll (Northwestern at No. 7, Stony Brook at No. 18).
Leading that defensive effort for the Women of Troy is a trio of talented defenders in junior Courtney Tarleton, who has caused six turnovers thus far; senior Elizabeth Eddy, who has picked up eight ground balls; and sophomore Nina Kelty, who has started in every game she has played in since arriving as a freshman last year. Most of USC’s defensive reserves are upperclassmen as well, which Munday says has been a big factor in the success of the back unit.
“Defense is our most veteran position, and it has really been a strong suit for us so far,” she said. “In fact, it has been for the past couple seasons. We have quite a number of juniors and seniors that are playing back there that have been able to gel together over the last few years, and so they are really playing well as a unit.”
The last line of defense for the Women of Troy is touted freshman goalie Gussie Johns, who has had an immediate impact with 10 saves and just 29 goals allowed in her first four collegiate games.
Together, the defensive unit will be tasked with slowing down two high-scoring Liberty attackers in senior Sam Struss and freshman Katy Pridemore. Struss and Pridemore have each put home 14 goals apiece for the Lady Flames, with Pridemore also adding five assists and Struss four to form a prolific one-two offensive punch for Liberty.
Also notable for the Lady Flames is junior midfielder Kallie Britton, who has forced 11 turnovers, picked up 11 ground balls, scored 7 points on five goals and two assists and won seven draw controls thus far.
In goal for Liberty is junior Juliann Elmer, who has surrendered 82 goals thus far this season. But be wary of that number: Elmer has also made 80 saves already this year, and her 16 saves per game is currently top in the country. The high number of goals surrendered is likely a product of having faced a whopping 184 shots in just five games so far this year.
“Elmer has made a ton of saves already this season,” Munday said. “We know she’s good, and so our focus offensively Monday will be on putting away those good scoring opportunities we do get.”
Looking to add to Elmer’s shots-faced and goals-surrendered tallies this year for the Women of Troy will be star junior attacker Caroline de Lyra, who has 17 points this season on 10 goals and seven assists, Michael, who has 13 points on nine goals and four assists, and junior Amanda Johansen, who has nine points on eight goals and an assist.
De Lyra has had tricks in three of the team’s four games, while Michael and Johansen have been dominant in winning draw controls for the Women of Troy.
Michael leads the team with 27 and Johansen has added 15, helping the team gain a 58-27 advantage in the area so far this season.
By comparison, Liberty has secured just 61 draw controls to its opponents’ 84. That discrepancy could prove critical come game time Monday.
“Controlling the draws, no matter the game or opponent, is a huge focus of ours,” Munday said. “While we have done pretty well in the first four games, we know that come 3 p.m., it’s a brand new game, Liberty is a good team, and especially after the long break, our girls are excited and ready to get back out there.”
Monday’s match kicks off at 3 p.m. at McAlister Field.

There are some evil geniuses behind the marketing for Avengers: Age of Ultron. This past Wednesday, they posted the following promoted tweet: “It’s go time, Marvelites: Tweet using #AvengersAssemble to unite & unlock an epic new #Avengers #AgeOfUltron Trailer!”
And, on cue, thousands of faithful Marvelites flooded the website with what amounted to free publicity. Disney (Marvel’s parent company) dangled a third trailer for the mega-blockbuster like a carrot on a stick and sat back to watch as the Internet did their work for them. Plenty of entities have tried to harness the power of the Internet to generate buzz for their products, but rarely does a company manage it with such surgical precision.
A major reason that it worked so effectively is the nature of the overall game Marvel is playing right now. The studio is playing with house money. Their string of hugely successful superhero films — starting with 2008’s Iron Man — has essentially left them with a captive audience, ready to gobble up whatever they choose to do next. This is why the studio felt comfortable making a movie about a previously unknown team featuring a talking raccoon and a walking tree. In 2008, people were skeptical about the plausibility of standalone films for Thor and Captain America. In 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy became the third highest-grossing film of the entire year. This is the climate that Disney/Marvel are working in. The anticipation is so high for the new Avengers film opening on May 1 that theaters have already started selling tickets two months in advance. Some theaters even announced 29-hour marathon screenings of all 10 Marvel Cinematic Universe films in the days leading up to the release. Marvel is playing a different game than everyone else right now.
But even the film studio, which is arguably flying the highest out of any out there right now, can’t get them all right. The ABC series Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., though popular, has not reached the level of otherworldly success that the films have. In another attempt to use its considerable clout with the fans, Marvel planned to release the hotly anticipated first trailer for Age of Ultron during the airing of the Oct. 28 episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Instead, a grainy version of the trailer was posted online almost a week early on Oct. 22. Marvel quickly adjusted and released the high-resolution version of the trailer, along with a tweet blaming their own fictional international evil organization Hydra for the leak. They adjusted well, but the opportunity was lost.
Leaks have become almost commonplace. The Sony hacking scandal was by far the biggest example of this, but it is far from the only one. Just a couple weeks ago, the entire third season of House of Cards was posted online 16 days early. Netflix quickly took it down — and took a page from Marvel’s book by posting a funny tweet in response — but it didn’t stop plenty of spoilers from being posted online.
It’s perhaps because of these spoilers that some musicians have begun releasing surprise albums. Beyoncé’s self-titled fifth studio album was posted to iTunes without any previous announcement or promotion. The album was a smash success and the surprise release only helped it be more impactful. This model is diametrically opposed to the one Marvel is using right now. Beyoncé, and later Drake’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, created buzz when their sudden unexpected releases sent shockwaves across the Internet.
Marvel is trying to work its fans up to a fever pitch to release its film in the most hyped-up climate possible. Marvel’s strategy is the more familiar model, and honestly, it is more workable for most mediums — it would be a bit silly to imagine a major motion picture being released all of a sudden online like a Beyoncé album. There is too much riding financially on each film. A top commercial album isn’t cheap to make, but a film is another animal entirely. The first Avengers film cost $220 million to make; Ultron undoubtedly surpassed that figure. A movie studio is not going to spend that kind of cash and then risk releasing its product by surprise and watch it fall short of expectations. Remember, surprise releases don’t always succeed, as Bono and his automatically uploaded Songs of Innocence can attest to. If it is not a feasible model, however, then it almost means that studios will have to accept the likelihood of leaks as part of the new media landscape. In the past, there were complete surprises in film. Gabriel Byrne, Benicio Del Toro, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Baldwin and Kevin Pollak all thought that their characters were secretly Keyser Soze while filming The Usual Suspects. George Lucas didn’t even tell Empire Strikes Back director Irvin Kershner the truth about Luke Skywalker’s parentage until very late in the game. In both cases, audiences were floored after the big reveal. Now, people were caught trying to fly drones into the Star Wars: The Force Awakens set in an attempt to glean a tiny bit of information. The public actively seeks out leaks and spoilers so much, it is almost expected at this point when spoilers happen.
That is, if the artists don’t spoil it themselves. Kanye West announced that his next album So Help Me God would have been a surprise release, following in his beloved Beyoncé’s footsteps. He then proceeded to release multiple tracks from the album early along with the album art and title. Kanye might yet have a few tricks up his sleeve for his “surprise” album, but so far it looks like the artist couldn’t help himself in letting the cat out of the bag early.
Marvel is guilty of this as well. The Twitter-fed third trailer contained a lot of previously unseen footage. Some of this footage was extremely spoiler-laden for those who looked at it closely. A character is clearly shown fighting for opposite sides at different parts of the trailer, giving away what will likely be played as a surprise twist at some point in the film. In the fervor to rile up its fans, Marvel has managed to play spoiler to itself. A happy medium should be in there somewhere, and companies should try to find it instead of blindly following Marvel’s lead.

 Agree with most of your points here, but I don’t think you’re covering all angles. For some fans, the hype of a movie adds another dimension to watching it. Using your example of the character changing sides; for the regular viewer it’ll be played off as a surprise, I’m sure, and it will be a surprise because no ordinary moviegoer will have looked that closely to the trailer. But to the diehard Marvel fan, who is presumably familiar with the comics, that won’t be a surprise. They know how the dynamics play out. What WILL be a surprise will be this: why, in what appears to be the finale action sequence, is Quicksilver not fighting on SW’s side? The Marvel fans would never have bought into the manufactured suspense of a change of heart ripped directly out of the comics. However, what will build tension is looking out for this extra dynamic in the split. The movie doesn’t have to capitalise on it, because people will be looking out for it. They’ll be watching on a different level. Another example is the woman in the cave-there are two options as to who she is, and the split’s pretty much fifty fifty. A normal viewer will watch the sequence with her in it and come out saying, “hey that was cool”, but that would never have been enough for a fan. Particularly with one of the options, that character in that setting is not a surprise to someone familiar with the story in the source material. What will be exciting is watching the movie, reevaluating your predictions, making speculation, waiting with baited breath to see who she is. It doesn’t matter which theory’s right; they’re more or less equally likely. What matters is that another level has been added by the “leak” of potential information. Same goes for the hints of death. The studio’s dropped hints that we’ll see character death over the next few movies. One is obvious, but every fan has speculated who, if anyone, else will go. That’s exciting, and it gives the moviegoing experience new definition.

With an a plethora of dining options surrounding USC including burger joints, pizza parlors, sandwich shops and cafes, one might wonder what can be added to the community that is not already accessible to USC students. The obvious answer? A high-quality ice cream sandwich shop.
Located on 3335 So. Figueroa St. next to CVS, CREAM provides customers with homemade cookies, excellent ice cream and other appetizing sweets to build an ice cream sandwich that satisfies their sweetest desires. This is the first CREAM location to open in Los Angeles. There are currently nine CREAM locations open throughout California, and the chain has plans to expand in the future.
After months of endless planning and a week of promoting free ice cream sandwiches, CREAM prepared for an enormous turnout of eager customers. And indeed, the massive line bringing together USC students and other Los Angeles community members alike is a testament to the notion that even in days of everlasting midterm strife and hectic schedules, people take their ice cream seriously.
The interior of the restaurant is minimal in decoration and limited in space, making for a pleasantly casual atmosphere. The employees are enthusiastic as they assist customers, build ice cream sandwiches and offer suggestions for those who are indecisive. Once at the front of the line, the serving process is quick and simple. When ordering an ice cream sandwich, customers are able to choose from a wide selection of cookies, ice cream flavors and toppings all for just $2.99. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the CREAM experience is selecting one ice cream flavor out of the many, which include french vanilla, chocoholic, butter pecan and strawberry cheesecake. The ice cream selection, along with a cookie selection including chocolate chip, snickerdoodle and red velvet, are sure to make the possibilities of sweet desires infinite, keeping CREAM a fresh snacking option over time. Among CREAM’s toppings are gummy bears, cherries, sprinkles and Nutella. Brownies and milkshakes are alternatives for those who are not in the mood for ice cream sandwiches.
Though a majority of restaurants with alternative dining options might be underwhelming with their limited gluten-free and vegan-friendly options, this is not the case with CREAM. One of the restaurant’s most impressive features is that there are enough gluten-free, dairy-free and vegan-friendly options to include those with special dietary needs in the fun of creating endless ice cream sandwich combinations. A broad selection of options is necessary for restaurants specializing in customization, and CREAM provides customers with a satisfying range of sweets.
Two integral yet generally overlooked components of any ice cream sandwich are the cookies, which are not as thick in width as some might expect. On their own, the chocolate chip cookies are decent but do not capture the warm essence of most homemade cookies. As a sandwich, however, the cookie-to-ice-cream ratio is perfect and prevents customers from being overwhelmed by the cookie or the ice cream. The combination of the cookies and ice cream are sure to take anyone’s taste buds to exciting territories.
The freshly baked cookie aroma looming within CREAM might be misleading to those expecting fresh, chewy cookies. The first bite of the chocolate chip cookie requires one to bite with colossal strength. Once past the hard edge, the center of the cookie is softer, making the sandwich much more enjoyable. The sweetness of the chocolate chip cookie then works with the richness of the ice cream, making for an irresistible and fulfilling snack. After finishing one of CREAM’s ice cream sandwiches, it becomes puzzling why this sweet, satisfying place had not found its way into the area sooner.
What might be considered the most appealing part of the ice cream sandwich, the ice cream, is plentiful and unique in flavor. In particular, the soy mint chocolate chip ice cream abounds in the rich, sweet mixture of soy milk and chocolate, and contains a subtle yet satisfying hint of mint in every bite. The quality and richness of the ice cream is enough to distinguish it from generic-brand mint chocolate chip ice cream.
As evidenced by the organization of the opening of CREAM, much effort has been put into ensuring a pleasant, lasting first impression among customers. With the incredible amount of customers leaving CREAM with both a smile and an ice cream sandwich, it is difficult to find an aspect on which CREAM fails to deliver.
It might be easy to get caught up in the fast and furious midterm frenzy, but much like the success of its opening day suggests, CREAM provides uplifting treats suitable for any occasion. As any ice cream connoisseur will tell you, when ice cream is low quality, it’s still tolerable. But when ice cream is as top-notch as it is at CREAM, it is nothing short of heavenly.

The Trojans made camp in San Diego for the Pacific Coast Doubles Championships exhibition tournament in La Jolla, California, this past weekend.
After falling in a 4-3 upset loss to then-ranked No. 51 Tulsa on Feb. 28, the No. 6 USC men’s tennis team picked itself up with a 5-2 win at No. 32 San Diego last Thursday. USC head coach Peter Smith believes his team’s 4-3 loss to Tulsa last week was a nice reality check for his players before heading down to San Diego.
“Winning as much as we’ve won, you take it for granted a little bit,” Smith said. “We brought a lot of guys to play, they need some experience, and hopefully I think that’ll be a good lesson for us in the end.”
Smith felt that, overall, the team regrouped well in practice following the upset.
“I think the perfect season is one where you overcome adversity,” Smith said. “That certainly was an adversity for us, and I think we’ve done a great job in the last week of putting it behind us and working really hard. We had a good match against a really good team like San Diego, so we have ways to go forward.”
Going up against San Diego on Thursday, the Trojans came out of the gate neck-and-neck with the Toreros in doubles competition. The senior Trojan pair of Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz, the No. 2-ranked doubles team in the nation, took down the Torero team of Jordan Angus and Filip Vittek, 6-3, to open the day.
San Diego would then bounce back as the team of Ciaran Fitzgerald and Geoffrey Fosso defeated the Trojan freshman duo of Thibault Forget and Tanner Smith, 7-5. The rubber match of doubles competition came down to the very end — senior Eric Johnson and junior Max De Vroome fell via tiebreaker to the Toreros’ Romain Kalaydjian and Uros Petronijevic 7-6(6), clinching the doubles point for San Diego.
Trailing 0-1 after doubles, the Trojans powered back in the singles competition. No. 31-ranked senior Jonny Wang made quick work of Angus to get things going, defeating him 6-2, 6-4 to put the teams on terms at 1-1 and get things going for the Trojans. Next, No. 72 de Vroome took down Fosso 6-3, 6-3 to give the Trojans their first lead at 2-1. The score was soon brought level again, however, as the Toreros’ Petronijevic upset Hanfmann, ranked No. 6 nationally, 7-6(6), 6-2.
But Hanfmann’s doubles partner would help avenge his loss, as No. 20 Quiroz claimed victory over Vittek 7-6(6), 6-2 to put the Trojans back up 3-2. Quiroz would spark a three-match run for the Trojans – No. 45 sophomore Nick Crystal would defeat Fitzgerald 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 and Johnson would overcome Angus 7-6(4), 4-6, 6-2 to capture the final two points as well as the 5-2 victory for USC.
Playing in the Pacific Coast Doubles Tournament over the following three days, the Trojans faced pairs from nine other schools including Rice, Pepperdine, Stanford and UCLA. In the men’s open doubles tournament, the duo of Johnson and de Vroome won six matches to reach the championship round, but narrowly fell in the final to UCLA’s Marcos Giron and Dennis Novikov 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4.
At the doubles tournament over the weekend, Smith took pride in being asspciated with the tournament’s history.
“It’s actually a really special doubles tournament,” Smith said. “It’s the oldest tennis tournament in the history of the United States. I don’t know exactly, but it’s like 120 years old. A lot of history has been played at the La Jolla Beach Tennis Club, so it [was] a pretty special place to be.”
De Vroome and Johnson will get their shot at redemption next week as the Trojans are next set to face their cross-town rivals, UCLA, March 14 at Marks Stadium. Having started the season atop the national rankings, the Trojans will look to regain ground after the upset to Tulsa dropped them five spots, though Smith is not too concerned about his team’s ranking just yet.
“I knew we’d drop at [the loss to Tulsa],” Smith said. “The funny thing is we were going to drop anyway with how the rankings work, but the most important thing is: are we the best team. The only thing that matters is, are we ready when the NCAAs come around. [Making sure we’re ready is] my job. We’ve always been able to do that in the past. Being the best team we can be is so important, and we’ll be there.”

On a hot Saturday afternoon that reached into the upper 80s, the USC football team took over Cromwell Field for their third practice of the spring, though,  this was the first time the Trojans were able to practice with shoulder pads.
Practice centered on position- specific drills, 11-on-11, as well as one-on-one’s with wide receivers against cornerbacks. Competition was extremely high and the energy was electric with players getting hyped after every big play.
One of the main focuses during practice was getting the quarterbacks in rhythm with their wide receivers. Both seniors Cody Kessler and Max Browne threw some great balls to receivers who were running double moves. Even Ricky Town showed what he was capable of during the 11-on-11 drill.
With a depleted wide receiver core, sophomore JuJu Smith has taken control and has started to prove to be a leader. Smith was very consistent at practice making most of the catches in his vicinity as well as running crisp routes. Wide receivers to watch are junior college transfer Isaac Whitney and sophomore Darreus Rogers.
Whitney on the football field looks like a man among boys. He is 6-foot-4 and 205 pounds, and he uses his body extremely well to shield defenders from intercepting the pass. Rogers, who is known for his vertical jump and high point ability will have more the opportunity for repetitions with the first team offense. On Saturday, he showed that he has soft hands but, also the ability to secure the ball. A highlight for him at practice was leaping over senior cornerback Ryan Dillard to make an unbelievable catch.
On the defensive side of the ball, they were extremely active and energized. Last season the weakest position for the Trojans was their secondary but on this day they were outstanding, led by senior cornerback Kevon Seymour. Seymour had one interception and several other pass break up while being mainly lined up opposite of Smith.
“I look at myself as a shutdown corner and we got other guys that can do the same,” Seymour said. “We got a lot of great receivers and they are making us better.”
Both defensive and offensive lines were going at it, doing several different drills together working on technique and speed. Being in shoulder pads for the first time, the defense had to some adjusting to do on their pass rushes.
“Our pad play needs to improve right away. You get used to being in helmets and jerseys and you can stay high,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “This showed up today when lines were getting pushed around a little bit but the defense front improved as the practice went on.”
In one of the last few plays of practice, redshirt sophomore tight end Connor Spears scored a touchdown after beating junior linebacker Su’a Cravens. Spears has been seeing more action recently because of  the absence of sophomore tight end Bryce Dixon.
Missing at practice on Saturday was Pac-12 Defensive Freshman of the Year Adoree’ Jackson as he was attending a funeral. Also absent was Dixon, who is still suspended from the team. The next practice is on Tuesday, and Sarkisian stated that there’s  a good chance it will once again be in full pads.
There is no way you were at practice on Saturday!!!

Another year of USC football has officially started, with the Trojans a couple practices deep into their spring session. Though spring practice usually doesn’t offer a very accurate preview of the season to come, due to offseason injuries, it does provide a barometer of individual player development.
This year is no different as some key Trojans are sidelined with or limited by injuries, surgery recovery and other                      non-football related issues. On the defensive line, interior lineman Antwaun Woods is out for the spring, recovering from a torn pectoral muscle. Woods has been a constant presence on the line since he stepped on the field and will be a contributing member when the season starts.
This void leaves the door wide open for younger players to step up and demonstrate their abilities to the coaching staff. Though USC recruited a strong 2015 class across the line, these prospects won’t be suiting up for the Trojans until fall practice. That leaves the door wide open for Trojans like Claude Pelon, Delvon Simmons and Cody Temple to further establish themselves as mainstays on the line.
Additionally, former top-rated line recruit Kenny Bigelow is still limited while recovering from surgery to repair a torn ACL. Bigelow should be a dominant force when the season starts, wreaking havoc on opposing lines. It would be a huge plus for the Trojans if Pelon or Simmons could emerge this spring as a dynamic bookend to complement Woods and Bigelow when the season starts.
The next level on defense looks even more promising. USC was able to bring in the best linebacker corp in the country from recruiting, one of whom, Cameron Smith, is already enrolled. USC is also benefitting from the return of inside linebacker Lamar Dawson, who was out last season with a torn ACL. Dawson, a strong and athletic inside backer, can help offset the loss of Hayes Pullard to the NFL. Prior to his injury, Dawson displayed flashes of his immense potential and he has picked up where he left off, impressing in early spring workouts.
The team will also be buoyed by the return of Jabari Ruffin, another highly touted local prospect who has suffered through injuries during the early part of his USC career. Ruffin, who played at Downey High School, has the size and speed to be effective as a pass rusher or dropping back into coverage. The combination of Ruffin, Dawson, the new freshmen and the continued development of Anthony Sarao and Su’a Cravens projects the linebackers to be a strength of next year’s team.
The spring session has also been kind to the secondary, with multiple players making statements with their play.  Kevon Seymour, who seemingly has been around forever, has starred thus far in spring, making a compelling statement to be a fixture alongside lockdown cornerback Adoree’ Jackson. The Trojans, however, go much deeper than just Seymour though. Both Jonathan Lockett and Chris Hawkins have taken reps in the secondary, with both demonstrating continued improvement from last season.
Having a deep secondary will be important next season, as it appears Jackson will be taking on a more significant role on offense. A threat to score every time he touches the ball, Jackson is too much of an asset to only be deployed once or twice a game. He also happens to be one the best cover cornerbacks in the      Pac-12, so having depth behind him on defense acts as an insurance policy from the wear and tear of being an ironman.
On offense, the Trojans are a bit more settled at most positions. Running back Tre Madden is still limited with his lingering toe injury, but fellow tailback Justin Davis is more than capable of picking up the extra reps. The void created by the departure of Nelson Agholor looks to be filled by receiver JuJu Smith, who might already be just as dynamic as Agholor. With more targets next season, Smith could put together a year in 2015 that rivals the best output of Marqise Lee and Robert Woods.
The quarterback position is set with Cody Kessler at the helm, and spring practice has provided reassurance about the future of the position with Max Browne also demonstrating his immense talent. The one question mark will be at tight end with the current absence of Bryce Dixon, who has been held out of practice. Dixon, who had a fine freshman year, and could be used in a similar manner to former Washington Husky standout Austin Seferian-Jenkins, might not be with the Trojans in the fall.
This would be a significant loss for the team, and hopefully he is able to work out whatever issues are keeping him off the field. One player, who might offset some of the loss felt by Dixon, is Jalen           Cope-Fitzpatrick returning after being ineligible last season.
Cope-Fitzpatrick’s talent has never been in question, and if he continues to get back in the flow of the game and impress with a strong work ethic, he could be the surprise of the spring. If he is able to re-emerge, that would be a truly great spring story.

The No. 11 men’s swimming and diving team won the 2015 Pac-12 Men’s Swimming and Diving Championships in Federal Way, Washington over the weekend, the team’s first Pac-12 title since 1979.
The Trojans won with a program-record 818.5 points, coming from behind on the final night to overtake Stanford (809.5) by a slim nine-point margin. A margin of victory of nine points or less hasn’t decided a match since 1999, when Stanford beat Cal by eight points. Defending champion California placed third (673), Arizona was fourth (508), Arizona State was fifth (309) and Utah was sixth (283).
“The men were on fire all weekend long. I’m really proud of the team for building on the momentum and supporting each other. We had incredible energy,” USC coach Dave Salo said.
Senior Cristian Quintero made history when he became the first Pac-12 swimmer ever to win the 100y, 200y and 500y free in the same meet, winning the 100y free in 42.21. Quintero was named Pac-12 Swimmer of the Meet for his historic performance.
“I can’t speak highly enough about the performance of Cristian Quintero,” Salo said.  “It stands on its own. But his quiet leadership certainly pushed the envelope of our performances by so many others. The sophomore class came through the way we knew they could but did not quite materialize last year. Mike Domagala, Reed Malone, Santo Condorelli, Steven Stumph, Dylan Carter and the rest of them were amazing.”
Freshman Ralf Tribuntsov took fifth in the race in 42.88, while sophomore Reed Malone finished sixth in 43.03. The four swimmers now make up four of the top-six fastest Trojans ever in the event.
“And the incredible performance by our freshman Ralf Tribuntsov cannot be overstated,” Salo said. “He came through when we might not have expected it given his freshman status. Now that we know how to win we have to make this a habit.”
Sophomore Steven Stumph won the 200y breast to take home USC’s first conference title in the race since 2001. Junior Ridge Altman finished fifth in 1:55.04, senior Andrew Malone took seventh in 1:55.66 and junior Morten Klarskov was eighth (1:55.84) in his third-straight final in the race.
In the platform finals held last week, Trojan divers scored crucial points to add to USC’s winning total, as junior Collin Pollard was third (395.60) and senior Jordan Gear was fourth (360.35). Junior Deon Reid was ninth (313.00) and freshman Dashiell Enos was 14th (269.25).
The Trojans entered the 400 yard free relay, the final event of the event, with a 3-point lead. Tribuntsov, Condorelli, Malone and Quintero won the event in 2:49.50 to solidify the conference win for USC.
“This championship was an outstanding example of the camaraderie every member on this team feels towards each other,” Malone said. “Everyone had a role to play and every person stepped into that role without hesitation, not for themselves, but for the team.”
The NCAA Championships will be held from March 26-28 in Iowa City, Iowa.

With all the hype USC baseball has been creating for itself this season, last weekend’s Dodger Stadium College Baseball Classic was the team’s best chance yet to prove itself as one of the best in the country.
Pitted against the No. 6 Texas Christian University Horned Frogs on Friday and the No. 1 Vanderbilt University Commodores on Saturday, the Trojans lived up to expectations by defeating both squauds in dramatic fashion and forcing themselves back into the national college baseball spotlight.
On Friday, junior starting pitcher Brent Wheatley turned in 6.1 solid innings against TCU, keeping USC within striking distance until they broke open a 2-2 tie in the bottom of the sixth.
The Trojans strung together three singles, a sacrifice bunt and a towering home run off the bat of junior right fielder AJ Ramirez to give USC a 6-2 lead. Junior relief pitcher Kyle Davis could not hold onto the lead, however, as the Horned Frogs took advantage of errors by the Trojan defense and rallied to tie the game at 6 apiece.
The bullpens held steady through three extra innings, but it was the Trojans who finally broke through in the bottom of the 12th.
Junior center fielder Timmy Robinson hit a one-out single and stole second base to set the table for freshman infielder Angelo Armenta. Armenta singled up the middle for his first collegiate hit to put runners on the corners with one out and junior third baseman Blake Lacey coming to the plate.
The Trojans caught the Horned Frogs off guard with a suicide squeeze bunt and even a fantastic sliding effort from TCU pitcher Trey Teakell could not keep Robinson from scoring the winning run, as he barreled over catcher Evan Skoug in a violent collision.
The Trojans streamed onto the field in celebration of their latest win against a nationally ranked opponent. Head coach Dan Hubbs thinks the                  late-inning heroics will help boost team morale going forward.
“I think that any time you can win close games against really good teams it says a lot about your team,” Hubbs said. “Being able to come up against their bullpen and their best guys, I think that has to give the kids a lot of confidence.”
Saturday’s matchup against Vanderbilt proved to be just as exciting as Friday’s late-inning thriller, as the two teams fought back and forth all day.
Junior starter Kyle Twomey was solid through five innings and kept the Trojans in the game by giving up only four runs. The left-hander scattered 12 hits over his five innings of work, but he successfully avoided any big innings for the Commodores, forcing them to scratch together rallies to score any runs.
After retiring the first two batters of the game, Twomey surrendered a single to the Commodore’s three-hole hitter, Dansby Swanson. The Vanderbilt shortstop proceeded to steal both second and third base before first baseman Zander Wiel drove him in on an RBI single to give the Commodores an early 1-0 lead.
The Trojans would eventually jump out to their first lead of the day in the bottom of the third when Ramirez hit a lead off double. He advanced to third when sophomore shortstop Reggie Southall reached on a throwing error by Vanderbilt starter John Kilichowski on a sacrifice bunt attempt.
USC then took a 3-1 lead on an RBI sacrifice fly from Stahel and an RBI sacrifice squeeze bunt from senior catcher Garrett Stubbs.
Vanderbilt struck again in the top of the fifth, piecing together a long two-out rally. Four-straight Commodore hits brought the score back to a deadlock at 4-4.
That marked the end of Twomey’s day, but Hubbs was impressed with his performance.
“I thought [Twomey] battled,” Hubbs said. “I didn’t think he had his best stuff and he was leaving his fastball up and flat … but he made some pitches when he had to and that kept us in the game.”
The Trojans struck back immediately on an RBI single from Stubbs in the bottom of the fifth, but the Commodores came back again to tie the game at 5-5 with an RBI single from sophomore Bryan Reynolds in the top of the eighth inning.
USC won in dramatic fashion, walking off on a pinch-hit home run from Adalberto Carrillo to win the game 6-5. The Trojans rushed out of the dugout for the second-straight day as they celebrated back-to-back walk-off wins against top-10 ranked opponents.
Carrillo’s first career home run could not have come at a better moment. The stage was set in a tie game in the bottom of the ninth, full count, two outs and with one swing of the bat, he propelled the Trojans past the Commodores and back into the national spotlight.
“It was a big spot for me and I was kind of nervous,” Carrillo said. “I ended up putting a swing on it and the ball went over the fence. I couldn’t believe it. I was running around the bases as if it was just a dream.”
Since when is giving up four runs in five innings solid. That works out to be a 7.2 era in pitching vernacular. Letting the other team get back in the game repeatedly not a good performance. Most of the damage done with two outs and bases empty.

In response to the recent outcry over racial profiling, the U.S. Department of Justice built a case against the Ferguson, Missouri, police department to address the significant racial gap in arrest rates. On March 4, the Justice Department announced a lack of evidence for the indictment of Darren Wilson, the police officer involved in the Michael Brown case, but heavily criticized the police department’s conduct in racial profiling. The lawsuit, however, was on a conditional basis, and as such, litigation will persist if the police department continues its racially charged hyper-incarceration.
After the grand jury in St. Louis failed to indict Wilson for the death of Michael Brown in late November, severe skepticism toward the fairness of its ruling has since prompted Attorney General Eric Holder to action. Evidently, the possibility of legal action is a tool used to rid the police department of unjust and discriminatory practices as well as the unlawful, overuse of police brutality. At the same, this is also an effort to answer the marginalized black community and soothe racial tensions that are rampant in the U.S. The decision to do so is quintessential; this will ensure that minorities have equal protection under the law, as opposed to guaranteed criminalization under the law. It is the first logical step to bolster racial equality.
According to USA Today, FBI Statistics from 2011 and 2012 show that African-Americans are nine times more likely to be arrested than any other group. Based on these significantly disproportionate numbers, this pattern illustrates that criminality is not a “black person only” problem but a problem of the system and its promotion of racial profiling. In the case of Ferguson, the Justice Department’s sole responsibility should be to stymie the advancement of discrimination, as the government itself is responsible for institutionalizing racism by doing nothing to punish the Ferguson police department. The very system created to prevent this prejudice has actually been what proliferates it. Suing the police department is the Department of Justice’s way of correcting the problem of racial discrimination. As a result, Ferguson is a landmark case for the Department of Justice.
Since the failure to indict Wilson, the black population of the U.S. has experienced widespread distrust of the justice system. According to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center and USA Today, about 64 percent of African-Americans in the U.S. say race played a major role in both the Brown and Eric Garner decisions. About half of the black population expect relations between local police and people of color to worsen in 2015. Such findings illustrate the superseding doubt of the justness and capability of the American legal system. The Justice Department must ultimately sue the police department in order to restore its legitimacy and credibility in the eyes of the African-American community. Furthermore, failure to do so would constitute a violation of civil human rights.
Though policing racial profiling and other measures of discrimination is a daunting, seemingly neverending pursuit, it is important for the Department of Justice to follow through in its condemnation of racial inequality. Preparing a case sends a firm and a very important message to police departments nationwide: there are real and severe consequences to unlawful actions.
Moreover, the Department of Justice must follow suit in protecting the rights of all people, regardless of race or ethnicity; indicting the Ferguson police department would have done just that.
Lida writes “African-Americans are nine times more likely to be arrested than any other group. Based on these significantly disproportionate numbers, this pattern illustrates that criminality is not a “black person only” problem….” It would be helpful to know how many more times African-Americans COMMIT crimes in order to best understand this awful statistic.  Until then, one cannot determine if the statistic is a racial pattern of criminal behavior; or is a pattern of unfair, discriminatory law enforcement arrests on a vast, nation-wide level.

Sugar might not be so sweet after all. Though the conventional wisdom of “calories in vs. calories out” has long dictated nutritional recommendations for a healthy weight and lifestyle, mounting evidence indicates that this idea could be a drastic oversimplification of the way the foods we eat impact our health. As it turns out, not all calories are created equal. Sugars not found naturally in foods adversely impact metabolism, which causes the liver to generate fat; when consumed in excess proportions, added sugars often lead to insulin resistance. With obesity on the rise — accompanied by burdensome, sometimes life-threatening conditions such as heart disease and Type 2 diabetes — it is important that greater attention be brought to this insidious, white culprit.
The link between sugar intake and the growing public health crisis is causing increasing concern among top health advisory groups. Last month, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, which meets once every five years, addressed the prevalence of sugar in the American diet and recognized its role in the increase of chronic and cardiovascular diseases. The panel endorsed an FDA-proposed rule that would require food producers to include a distinct line for added sugars on nutrition labels. Industry giants have actively lobbied against such a requirement, fearing that it will adversely impact sales.
The American Heart Association recently recommended a reduction in sugar consumption from an average of 22 daily tablespoons among most Americans to no more than nine tablespoons for men and six for women. The World Health Organization has echoed these guidelines, urging people to cut added sugars down to only five percent of their daily caloric intake. The WHO had previously advised a 10 percent limit.
There’s no nutritional benefit that accompanies the addition of sugar to foods, yet its presence in the American diet has steadily increased since the 1980s, when concerns over fat content in processed foods led to the replacement of fat with sugar. Products touting “low-fat” and “fat-free” credentials saturated the markets. The problem? These products brimmed with added sugars. Sodas and fruit juices, which provide half of the daily sugar intake of the average adult in the U.S., have become commonplace. Even foods that do not taste overtly sweet — salad dressings and sauces — often contain shocking amounts of added sugars.
But a body of scientific literature proposes that even better labeling might not be effective at curbing American sugar consumption. These studies suggest that sugar is an addictive substance, stimulating the same neurological pathways as an opioid drug and thus forming compulsive habits in consumers. Researchers liken sugar-induced cravings to those brought on by other addictive substances like nicotine and cocaine. Our evolutionary history predisposes us to such an addiction, a genetic remnant of a time when sugars were rare and hunter-gatherer societies sought out energy-dense sweets in the wild. Today, sugar is highly concentrated in many of the foods we eat, but our brains still compel us to seek it out. Because it is no longer scarce, it is easy to satisfy these cravings instantly and repeatedly.
Public health advocates have called for necessary changes to the food culture to minimize the presence of sugar. Soda taxes and the elimination of sugar-sweetened beverages from hospitals and school cafeterias are two such proposals. Still, others worry that such a narrow focus on the elimination of added sugars could have unexpected consequences. As in the 1980s, when concerns over fat content led to its replacement with sugar, food companies may be inclined to replace sugar with another additive of equal threat to consumer health.
Rather, the consumption of wholesome, natural foods must become a priority. Natural sugars, like those in fruit and milk, should replace those that are artificially introduced, and a departure from the culture of processed and fast foods is essential. Only through these steps can society avert the public health catastrophe that has come to affect more than half of all Americans.

Not everyone has the same goals in life. Medical science has created many treatments for those willing to pay for them. If only we had a health system where the patient pays instead of having the costs spread through government to every man woman and child!
We agree with the overarching takeaway here that sugar can indeed be enjoyed in moderation. Villifying this single source of calories can certainly unleash “unintended consequences.” Moreover, numerous studies have shown that restricting one food or food group is not the best approach for achieving calorie balance or maintaining a healthy weight. A 2014 position statement from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics also supports this conclusion. Bottom line: moderation and balance are key, and sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages, can be part of a sensible dietary balance.
