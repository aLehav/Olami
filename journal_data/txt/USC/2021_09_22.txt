Following 10 months of contract negotiations and a two-day strike July 13-14, nurses at Keck Hospital of USC and USC Norris Cancer Hospital agreed to a new four-year contract with Keck Medicine of USC Wednesday. The contract will increase nurse wages, guarantee sick days off and increase the amount of time nurses have between shifts. 
Under the agreement’s terms, Keck will hire 70 new registered nurses by the end of the year. Nurses previously said understaffing through over reliance on contract nurses — who work at hospitals for short periods of time — hurt the quality of hospital care and strained nurses. 
Other changes include an increase in the mandated break time between shifts — from eight hours to nine — a 27.7% pay increase throughout nurses’ contracts and a guaranteed amount of personal protective equipment. 
“Our registered nurses are an invaluable part of our organization,” said Marty Sargeant, interim CEO and chief operating officer of Keck and Norris Hospitals, in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We are excited to move forward with a contract that reflects our commitment to our caregivers and supports our mission to provide exceptional patient care.”
Kerri Dodgens, a nurse in the Keck ICU float pool and member of the bargaining team and Professional Practice Committee — a union committee that addresses nursing practice concerns throughout the hospital — said she feels relieved that a contract was finally agreed upon.
 “I am really proud of my fellow nurses for standing strong and united together and not folding to the tactics that the hospital tried to employ at various points of just sort of scaring us away from what our goal was,” Dodgens said. “So I’m really proud of our nurses for what they want for their profession and what they want for their hospital.”
Michael Simonton, a nurse who works in the ICU at Keck, said that, after months of “very contentious” negotiations and nurses feeling the Hospital did not take nurse or patient safety seriously, he is hopeful  the new contract is “a start of a rebuilding of our relationship with the hospital.”
“When the hospital has committed to stop using [contract nurses] … it’s really a strong move and it shows that the hospital’s beginning to support patient safety the way that the nurses want them to,” Simonton said. 
The contract also includes bonuses for nurses, a guarantee that their retirement benefits will return Jan. 1, and the right to strike if changes are made in the retirement benefits’ language. 
Similar instances of nurses organizing strikes have occurred across the country. In Buffalo, N.Y., the Catholic Health System is preparing to employ replacement workers after nurses authorized a strike that will start Oct. 1. In Worcester, Mass., nurses at St. Vincent Hospital have been on strike since March 8. Registered nurses at Kaiser Permanente are also weighing a strike, citing understaffing concerns. 
Throughout negotiations, nurses expressed concerns that working conditions would deter nurses from joining Keck. In interviews with the Daily Trojan after the strike in July, nurses, including Dodgens and Simonton, said that the quality of the Hospital’s care declined and felt pressured by the Hospital to work 18 hour shifts while caring for “some of the sickest patients in the nation.” They said that although Keck was publicly calling nurses heroes but treating them poorly in private.
“It really just comes down to patient safety, and we want our nurses well rested so they provide the safest care possible,” Dodgens said. “We want them not overworked, not working 18 hour shifts constantly, feeling like they have to work an inordinate amount of overtime shifts just to keep the hospital up and running.”
After the strike and continued action by the nurses, the nurse’s bargaining team met with Keck on Aug. 31 to resume negotiations. On Aug. 27, the nurses voted that they were willing to strike in support of the bargaining team’s demands.
The new contract, Dodgens said, is a step in the right direction.
“We’re an industry-leading hospital,” Dodgens said. “We need nurses that can provide that type of care. We need a contract that is going to help attract those kinds of nurses, and I feel like now we have that.”

On Tuesday, members of the Undergraduate Student Government discussed plans to help expand hours at the Lyon Center, provided an update on upcoming diversity training, and announced Holly McCauley, a graduate student studying literary editing and publishing, as the nominee for Chair of the Legislative Branch Accessibility Affairs Committee. 
McCauley, co-executive director for the Student Assembly for Accessibility and former member of the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council and the USG Accessibility Committee, said she’d “always been involved in disability community activism,” but that she truly discovered her passion for academic accessibility when she sustained hearing loss at 16 years old and began experiencing educational barriers firsthand. 
When she first arrived at USC, McCauley said it was especially difficult to adjust as a student with a physical disability because professors and administrators didn’t “have the time or capacity to check in one-on-one with students.” 
To McCauley, on-campus student-run organizations such as USG and SAA are the ideal places to “amplify the voices of those disabled students that aren’t getting heard anywhere else.” 
On Sept. 28, the Senate will vote on McCauley’s confirmation. If she’s appointed as chair, McCauley will become responsible for overseeing the Accessibility Affair Committee’s projects for the rest of the year. 
One of USG’s upcoming projects, designed to raise awareness for disability rights, is an “accessibility scavenger hunt” taking place on Nov. 5. USG Vice President Lucy Warren said the scavenger hunt’s goal is to identify structures on campus that are non-compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Warren also hopes the event will further highlight the need for an on-campus “disability cultural center.” 
Warren said she has dealt with “several chronic illnesses” herself and knows what it’s like to face added challenges.
“[I] have varying accessibility needs that change day-to-day,” Warren said. “I have spent years battling dropping out of school because our school just doesn’t provide [the necessary] resources.” 
In addition to advocating for the disability cultural center, Warren said she’s been meeting with Provost Charles Zukoski to “create universal infrastructure” for students to access recordings for every class that’s offered at USC — both during and after the pandemic. At the moment, Warren and Zukoski are working to send out a “campus-wide survey of students’ experiences” to gauge how many people might benefit from such a program. 
During the meeting, Chief Diversity Officer Kavita Rai presented an update on the accessibility scavenger hunt, advocacy liaison training and an upcoming USG-wide implicit bias workshop.
Sen. Brian Stowe gave the second and final presentation of the night, in which he recounted his time spent meeting with USC Recreational Sports, alongside Sen. Russell Augustin, in the hopes of expanding gym hours at both the Village and Lyon fitness centers. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Stowe described expanding access to the fitness centers as his “top priority.” According to Stowe, he initially wanted to meet with the leadership from RecSports to figure out why the hours at the gyms were “so limited.” 
“In terms of expanding the hours, [RecSports has] 100 student workers. The gym is mostly run by students on work study programs or just applying for jobs. They’re really short-staffed … due to COVID happening, wiping out the whole student workforce,” Stowe said. “To rehire everyone, I was trying to give them some advice on how to expedite that process. They basically just need to have students set up on work days so they can get paid, and that’s really not a difficult process, the way they’re going about it is not efficient.” 
Stowe said he thinks RecSports should stop trying to schedule in-person appointments with each individual applicant and instead set up a mass Zoom call for people to “shuffle through” and show their passports on camera in order to verify they’re authorized to work. 
“I know a lot of that right now is just frustration and anger, because no one knows what’s going on,”  Stowe said. “But there’s reasons behind that, so we can just communicate the reasoning, and it will eventually return. That’s the next step.” 
Additionally, Sens. Diego Andrades and Devin Nyala, who both faced challenges as appeal students, are working to organize a virtual orientation and create new resources for students undergoing similar circumstances. 
“We applied to USC and didn’t get in, and then instead of waiting to transfer, we actually appealed our rejection, and then got in,”  Andrades said. “I came to this school, and … there was always a part of me that felt like I didn’t belong, and that I didn’t deserve the appeal. That I just got lucky on a whim. Since then, I’ve done a lot, and I’ve realized that wasn’t the case … but I was really affected by my status as an appeal student.”
Nyala said being an appeal student is an “unconventional way” to enroll at USC.
“You really get pushed into it later than most people, even transfer students,” Nyala said. “By that time, everyone already has their roommates and everyone is just already making friends, so I think it was kind of difficult to really engage myself in the USC community.”

As part of the Interfraternity Council in the 2018-2019 school year and throughout his years at USC, Jack Elliott has seen drug overdose issues first hand. Elliott, a senior majoring in computational neuroscience, realized that although USC is home to a multitude of intelligent students, many of them have not received sufficient drug education. 
In Fall 2020, he and five others, many of whom were also involved in Greek life or studied neuroscience, founded Trojan Awareness Combating Overdose to help increase drug overdose awareness on campus. 
“There were a lot of near tragic cases that we saw in the years preceding TACO’s founding and these were things … that we thought people would be a little less likely to do given some more education,” Elliott said. 
In Fall 2019, USC lost three students to fentanyl overdoses. Fentanyl is an opioid that is 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin and can be found in cocaine and MDMA. Just two milligrams is enough for someone to overdose, a size that is virtually undetectable to the naked eye. 
“If you didn’t get [a drug] directly from your pharmacist, if it came from anybody else or anyone on the street, you really have no idea what’s in it,” said Madeline Hilliard, a USC 2021 alumna and co-founder and chief executive officer of TACO. 
To help prevent future fentanyl overdoses, TACO partnered with Duffl last spring, a delivery service geared toward college students, to make testing strips more accessible. Through other services, people have to pay $2.50 for a strip that could take three to five days to arrive, but using Duffl, a student can buy three strips for one cent, the minimum price on Duffl, and the strips will be delivered to their location. 
“From the time that they decide to order the strip to when their drug is actually tested positive or negative for fentanyl, it’s 15 minutes,” Hilliard said. “So there’s no time delay, there’s no cost barrier.”
Earlier this month, TACO began trial stages of a program where students can scan a QR code included in the set of strips to report a positive batch. According to those reports, there were six positive tests for fentanyl and one non-fatal overdose the weekend of Sept. 11.
One positive test can mean more than one person was affected because the test could be “for one gram of cocaine,” which 10 to 15 people can use, according to Isabella Gianatiempo, director of outreach and a senior majoring in neuroscience and health and human sciences. If a batch tests positive for fentanyl, students are encouraged to dispose of the drug either by throwing it away or flushing it down a toilet. 
TACO plans on teaming up with the Undergraduate Student Government and USC Student Health to add fentanyl and meth test strips to the wellness vending machine at King Hall, open 24 hours a day. It also hopes this partnership opens up an opportunity to expand its program. 
“That’s really what we’re hoping to see going forward — the support of Student Health in helping us provide that higher volume of test strips now that students are aware of this resource and the necessity of it,” Hilliard said. 
After founding TACO last year, Elliott and other co-founders said they decided the best way to get the word out about the program would be to expand their social media presence, primarily through Instagram. 
They use large fonts and easy-to-understand graphics to make information about drugs, such as the dangers of mixing certain substances and tips to prevent an overdose, as accessible as possible, Gianatiempo said. 
“We present [the information] in a way that’s digestible for users to interact with,” said Gianatiempo. “We want people to be able to look at an Instagram post and read it even if they’re in their most drunk state.”
Although TACO is composed of USC students, it is not affiliated with USC and is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, which has allowed them to expand to UCLA and UC Santa Barbara, with plans to expand to UC Berkeley as well. Test strips at UCLA sold out quickly after its launch. 
“None of these problems are unique to USC,” Elliott said. “So basically all of our goals revolve around sharing this information with more people and doing more fundraising to continue making sure cost isn’t an issue for testing drugs.”
TACO’s status as a nonprofit organization means that any donations are tax deductible for the donors. Its most recent donation push, which goes toward buying fentanyl strips, is bucket hats printed with “Test Your Drugs.” 
Elliott said when the organization started, he and other co-founders were not sure if people would care about the work they were doing. Since then, TACO has gained over 1,000 followers on Instagram and grown to an almost 30 person staff. 
“No matter how many hours we put in, if it’s saving one life, that’s worth it,” Elliott said.

In my last column, I discussed how the SEC empire increased its power when it was able to acquire University of Texas and University of Oklahoma from the Big 12. Even though the change didn’t go into effect immediately, the Big 12 decided to plan ahead. 
They decided to add four new teams to the conference to make sure they don’t disintegrate like the old Big East during conference realignment in the early 2010s. The newest members of the Big 12 conference will include Brigham Young University, University of Cincinnati, University of Houston and University of Central Florida. 
Even though the Big 12 is primarily based in the Midwestern area, they are expanding by going into the west with BYU, located in Utah, and the southeast with UCF in Florida. 
Although these additions will allow the Big 12 to get some revenue and popularity back, will these additions be able to offset the departure of Texas and Oklahoma?
First, let’s think about what this will mean for powerhouse sports such as football and basketball.
BYU, Cincinnati and UCF will all provide strength in football. 
BYU finished last season at No. 11 in the AP Poll, and Cincinnati was at No. 8. Although UCF was not ranked last season, it is a consistently strong program that went undefeated during the 2017 season, finishing the season ranked No. 6 in the nation. Houston football is not the university’s best athletics program, but the team usually goes to bowl games and was once ranked No. 8 in the 2015 season. 
Even though none of these programs can rival Oklahoma’s dominance in football, they can easily match Texas’ current state. Altogether, the new additions can give the Big 12 more opportunities to make the top-25 rankings andpotentially compete for a Playoff position. 
When it comes to basketball, all these teams can add some more power to the Big 12. 
Basketball isn’t typically an issue for the Big 12 with schools such as Kansas, Baylor and Oklahoma State that regularly dominate the competition. But schools such as Houston and Cincinnati can definitely add another layer to the Big 12’sbasketball depth. 
Houston was able to make it to the Final Four in last season’s NCAA men’s basketball tournament, and Cincinnati typically competed closely with Houston in conference play when they were both in the American Athletic Conference. 
But don’t count out BYU or UCF either. BYU beat powerhouse Gonzaga when they were both in the same conference, and UCF was almost able to knock off a Zion Williamson-led Duke team a few years ago in the NCAA tournament. 
It looks like the Big 12 should still be able to compete in both football and basketball. However, another important factor for the conference is whether or not they can still have enough revenue. 
As I mentioned in my last column, Texas and Oklahoma have the highest annual revenues in the conference, so it will be difficult to replicate that. But, with BYU having a large fanbase among the Latter-Day Saints community and UCF being one of the largest schools in terms of  enrollment in the country, there is room for potential growth in both revenue and popularity after the loss of its two biggest schools. 
Additionally, with Houston and Cincinnati dominating in basketball and football respectively, that can also add on to the money the conference can bring in and distribute to its members. 
Scheduling will be tough with these additions since travelling between states such as Utah and Florida for an in-conference matchup is a lot of work. However, there are many benefits for these additions. It was a great strategic move by the Big 12 to get these four schools into the mix. 
Losing the flagship schools of two states that have a dominant presence in college sports is not optimal. Still, by expanding its boundaries the Big 12 can tap into new markets which can add more revenue.
The Midwestern, college-town vibe behind the Big 12 might disappear as well by adding schools from large cities like Orlando, Houston and Cincinnati, but that is a small sacrifice that the conference will have to pay to remain relevant.
Overall, the Big 12’s change to be a more nationwide conference can have significant impacts in terms of revenue, popularity and other metrics. This will be a difficult task to accomplish, but if they are strategic about it, it can just work out. Other major conferences like the Big 10, Pac 12 and ACC have expanded to other regions, so why can’t the Big 12 make it function?
How well the move ends up being depends on how well all these schools perform on the field. With the backing of atop-five conference, these teams can jump to the next level and revitalize the Big 12.

Week two of the NFL season was a great showing for former USC players, who shined on both sides of the ball. The Trojans have an illustrious tradition of developing NFL talent, ranking second all-time in drafted players (516) and first round draft picks (83). 
Twelve former Trojans are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the most of all-time. There are currently 30 former Trojans on NFL rosters.
Sam Darnold
Former No. 3 overall pick Sam Darnold continues to impress as the Panthers quarterback, a team that he was traded to during the offseason. Darnold was a world class talent at USC from 2016 to 2017 and was the hero in the 2017 Rose Bowl victory against Penn State, which remains USC’s greatest triumph over the past five years. 
A lot of skepticism surrounded Darnold during his time in New York due to the team’s inability to win — last season the Jets went 2-14 with Darnold as a starter. However, continuous losing with New York proved to be an issue outside of Darnold’s control, as the Jets have started off the season 0-2 once again after a horrendous showing against the New England Patriots. 
Meanwhile, the Panthers have started the season 2-0 with Darnold under center, defeating the New Orleans Saints 26-7 Sunday. Darnold threw for 305 yards with two touchdown passes in the victory.
Robert Woods and Michael Pittman Jr. 
In Indianapolis, former USC stars and current NFL receivers Robert Woods and Michael Pittman Jr. faced off for the first time in a professional setting.
It can be argued that Woods is USC’s greatest receiver ever, holding the Trojans’ record for most receptions of all time (252) and ranking second in touchdowns scored (32), trailing only Dwayne Jarrett. Pittman Jr. was selected 34th overall by the Colts in the 2020 NFL Draft after a stellar four-year career at USC and hasn’t lost a step since he turned pro, leading the Colts with eight catches for 123 yards on Sunday. Woods hauled in five catches for 64 yards, for the Rams Sunday.
JuJu Smith-Schuster
JuJu Smith-Schuster, another member of USC’s 2017 Rose Bowl-winning team, was a game-changer for the Steelers in their matchup against the Raiders. Smith-Schuster was highly productive for the Trojans from 2014 to 2016, recording 213 receptions for 3,092 yards and 25 touchdowns. All of these statistics rank fifth all-time in USC history.
On Sunday, Smith-Schuster caught six passes for 41 yards, and also rushed for a touchdown.
Adoree’ Jackson and Leonard Williams
On the defensive side of the ball, Giants cornerback Adoree’ Jackson and defensive end Leonard Williams combined for ten tackles on Thursday against the Washington Football Team. The duo spent one season together with the Trojans in 2014 and have now reunited with the New York Giants. Both players were first round picks in their respective NFL Drafts.
Talanoa Hufanga and Amon-Ra St. Brown
49ers’ rookie safety Talanoa Hufanga recorded his first NFL tackle on Sunday against the Eagles. Another rookie, Amon-Ra St. Brown, racked up three receptions for the Detroit Lions Monday night against the Packers. Both of these young talents are already proving their worth in the NFL.
Malcom Smith
Super Bowl XLVII MVP Malcom Smith has started a new chapter of his career with the Cleveland Browns, and is proving to be a key defensive piece. The former USC outside linebacker tallied eight tackles and a big third quarter interception to help set the Browns up with great field position and seal the victory over the Houston Texans.

College is a difficult time; many go through extreme lows, experiencing some of the worst moments of their life. Therefore, USC must have a strong mental health office to assist students.
Currently, there are mental health offices in the Engemann and Eric Cohen student health centers, which offer individual and group counseling. USC also created Trojans Care 4 Trojans, an anonymous system for people to refer students to additional resources if they are concerned about anyone. 
While many students appreciate these resources, USC still has a long way to go in providing genuine, long-term mental healthcare. 
For example, TC4T only meets with patients once, even if the student has serious problems. Sometimes, it feels like the counselors do not even talk to students about their emotions and are simply satisfied with meeting as a formality. These appointments might feel like they aren’t actually for students’ well-being, but rather for liability issues. 
At Engemann and Eric Cohen, students can book a consultation and meet with a counselor four to eight times. However, getting long-term help is much harder. 
In the past, students complained about the lack of long-term counseling, which resulted in USC adding a new psychiatry floor in Engemann in November 2019. Although this has made it easier for students to seek care, it is not sufficient for 46,000 USC students. Students have to be referred to a psychiatrist first, and because psychiatry is mostly based on prescribing pharmaceuticals, not all students meet that criteria.
Engemann does not offer care to the majority of students who need long-term help. These students are usually referred to outside resources. As college students, this can be extremely difficult since going outside campus for mental health treatment means organizing transportation, finances and a new counselor who is covered by their health insurance. 
These ingenuine, short-term resources are not only extremely insulting but also detrimental to student health. There needs to be a push toward long-term mental health initiatives that truly help students, such as studying the root of mental health issues. 
By studying the root issue of student problems, USC can address these issues before more serious concerns arise. For example, if many students are having problems with academic pressure, the school could study why the environment is stressful for students instead of just holding appointments when they are on the brink. Consequently, the University could adjust its curricula and absence policies as preventive measures. Not only could this lead to less severe issues, but it would also promote an atmosphere that actually values students’ well-being. 
If a serious issue arises, USC should actually work to help the student, not just hold a couple of appointments or refer them to outside resources to escape liability. The counselors should ideally focus on what the student wants and adjust their counseling to make the student feel more valued and prioritized. 
Moreover, there still needs to be more counselors who provide long-term care on-campus. When students are vulnerable, they should not have to go through the intimidating process of finding an outside counselor. 
USC must take the initiative to make its students feel safer. Mental health is so fundamental to well-being; finding resources on campus should not be this difficult.

American popular culture often frames the college campus as an equalizer — an artificial brick oasis free from the country’s class stratification, pumping out high achievers destined to live off their meritocratic gains.
This intellectually dishonest picture has manufactured interesting ways of tip-toeing around the very real differences that exist on college campuses.
Playing pretend, rich students delusionally complain of imaginary poverty. Many, well aware of their true economic affluence, lament their financial destitution before splurging online in COMM lectures, withdrawing spending money from six-figure bank accounts in the Village Bank of America or dropping big bucks at Erewhon. 
These students’ forgetful desertions of their roleplay serve as a much-needed reality check for me. Sometimes I wonder if I’m living through some Bostromian simulation that toys with poor Black women, specifically. 
Amid the liars who so dutifully — and poorly — impersonate a nonexistent version of themselves, a group of individuals wear a very recognizable badge brazenly: Golden Gooses.
I vividly recall the first time I spotted one. Here I was on an elite campus, and my floormates couldn’t even afford new shoes. I even considered launching a shoe drive for the residents of Birnkrant’s sixth floor. I soon learned that not only were my floormates wearing these shoes voluntarily, but they were spending upward of $500 on some of these pairs. I was out of touch with an entire demographic at this school, and not being in people’s business just didn’t sit well with me.
I spoke to several USC students about their opinion of the shoe brand. Qualifiers often accompanied admissions of brand loyalty. Those I spoke to assured me they were not like other factions of Golden Goose owners — the factions who devotedly bought the brand’s most ridiculous designs, who only purchased them after being on campus for a week, who were gifted Golden Goose’s by their mother and had no interest in Italian craftsmanship, and on and on. 
The association of Golden Goose shoes with the Greek life population was probably the most prominent one. 
However, this stereotype has become larger than the brand itself. Research indicates Venetian designers Francesca Rinaldo and Alessandro Gallo did not have members of USC’s Kappa Kappa Gamma in mind when designing their shoes. In order to understand the appeal of Golden Goose, I had to go to its intended fan base.
Eli Kaufman, a junior majoring in economics and a member of USC’s streetwear club, already had thoughts about the growing popularity of the shoe. 
“I commented at lunch today that whenever I saw someone wearing Golden Geese, I wanted to beat them up,” Kaufman said. “I just wanted to punch them. I know this is being recorded, but it’s a joke. For legal purposes.”
Kaufman discovered the brand in high school and enjoyed connecting with other peers interested in fashion as much as he was. After coming to USC, the fashion enthusiast was pushed away from the brand due to its increasing popularity with “normies” — my words, not his.
“I saw so many people with [the shoe] … It didn’t feel special anymore to me,” Kaufman said. “So I kept it for a while, but I sort of wore it less. And then I started hating on it. I had some friends that hated on it, and I was like ‘You’re right… it is just a sorority girl shoe. This is over now.’”
That was until he began skating. How many students on this campus identify Golden Goose as a skate shoe? Well, the design has every marking of one. If one can ignore some of its more questionable models, the brand’s flat silhouette, narrower fit, durable sole and unkempt aesthetic are perfectly made for running pedestrians over on Trousdale.
Much of the brand’s existing controversy surrounds the commercialization of poverty, especially after the company sold a design that featured tape holding it together. However, I couldn’t help but look at my beat-up, year-old Reeboks and then back to the silver Golden Gooses that adorned Eli’s feet. In his words, Golden Gooses are meant to look “good distressed.” 
Stylistically, I may not agree with that, but they were definitely holding up better than my sneakers. No matter how distressed a Golden Goose shoe is, it’s impossible to tell how long the owner has worn it, by virtue of the design. For years, I’ve wondered how a fashion company swindled so many wealthy people into paying for distressed shoes, and here was the money-making difference.
“I went to Tokyo. And while I was there, I visited one of the Golden Goose stores that had just opened,” Kaufman said. “They have this cool little thing called Golden Goose Lab where you can go in and customize your shoes and add a bunch of designs and drawings.”
It’s this craftsmanship that affords Golden Goose an audience beyond its sensational hyper-distressed designs, such as Shawn Krantz, who prefers the cleaner designs of Golden Goose.
“First of all, I’m wearing them for a while so I usually go [for] designer shoes,” said Krantz, a junior majoring in business administration. “When I’m buying shoes, I’m gonna wear them for a long time; I’m not going to go buy another pair of the same thing.”
This column installment, for me, was an exercise in being wrong. At their core, Golden Goose wearers aren’t foolish kids with a poverty fetish. They appreciate fashion, craftsmanship, community and, of course, have the funds to pay for it. Like any in-group, there will be infiltrators. The stereotypical Golden Goose owner –– a wealthy, New York-born sorority girl –– has become the poster child for a brand that was once championed by, and still caters to, skaters with an appreciation for luxury. 
As for the shoe’s hefty price tag, I’ve realized the unabashed display of wealth is more comforting than its dismissal. Golden Goose owners are definitely not the common man. But on this campus, maybe we need to appreciate it when rich people do rich people things instead of donning the veil of being “middle class.”Amina Niasse is a junior writing about USC stereotypes, archetypes and trends.

The village is once again brimming with students standing in an endless Dulce line; Doheny Memorial Library is full of fierce typing and phone screens are now flashing vivid Trojan Check hues. All of this can only mean one thing: school is back in full-swing, whether you are ready for it or not.
But, as any good USC student is already aware, work breaks are vital to maintaining your sanity. And what better way to unwind is there than with a few good belly laughs? Whether you choose to stream as means of relaxation or procrastination, here is your ultimate guide to the best comedy television shows available to stream right now. 
Netflix
“The Good Place”
Perfect for resident Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences philosophy snobs, “The Good Place” follows Eleanor Shellstrop who, after living a far from perfect life, finds herself in the “Good Place” — a kind of Heaven — by accident. Alongside her designated soulmate Chidi and a few other loveable oddballs, the audience watches as flashbacks from Eleanor’s life on Earth reveal her true human nature, how she tries to correct it in the Good Place and how the afterlife is not at all what it seems to be. Featuring flawless philosophical and ethical lessons, “The Good Place” is full of smart jokes, mouth-watering frozen yogurt flavors and existential crises on what it means to be a truly good person.   
“Sex Education”
As many of us are painfully (really painfully) aware, adolescence is a confusing, awkward and, to be blunt, disgusting time. “Sex Education” is keenly conscious of this fact and does not take advantage of it but rather pokes fun at these growing pains. The show follows a British sixth former, Otis Milburn, who sets up an underground sex therapy clinic at his school. Check out it’s freshly released third season when you want a laugh or are procrastinating writing an essay. 
“Community”
After being forced to attend community college in light of faking his degree, “Community” follows lawyer-turned-student Jeff Winger who strikes up unlikely friendships with a Spanish class study group. The show is entwined with pranks, charisma and plenty of charming Donald Glover and Danny Pudi moments. Arguably some of the best scenes are featured at the end of the episodes (as who could forget Troy and Abed’s rendition of “¿Dónde Está la Biblioteca?”). 
Apple TV+ 
“Ted Lasso” 
Notable for single handedly increasing the serotonin levels of all of its devoted fans, “Ted Lasso” has recently swept the world of television. Featuring SNL alum Jason Sudeikis, West End veteran Hannah Waddingham and the relentless teasing of American culture, this show explores an underdog soccer team stuck with an American football coach as a part of an elaborate revenge scheme. Nonetheless, this show features Lasso’s undying charm, optimism and iconic mustache; although it is upbeat, the show also explores more serious subject matters, all while providing laughs for its audience.  
Hulu
“30 Rock”
This Emmy-winning series is built to elicit a half-hour of pure laughter. The show chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama and mischief of a live-sketch comedy show in New York. “30 Rock” follows the unlikely friendships between writers, actors and bosses as they navigate the risible drama, egos and capitalistic nature of the entertainment industry. This show is a must-watch simply on the grounds of learning the party etiquette of main character Liz Lemon: “There ain’t no party like a Liz Lemon party, ‘cause a Liz Lemon party is mandatory!”
“How I Met Your Mother”
Despite the dumpster fire of a final season, “How I Met Your Mother” is a principal sit-com that follows best friends in New York who sometimes fall in and out of love with one another but still endure the trials and tribulations of adulthood. We follow architect Ted Mosby who, although seemingly put-together with his dream job and NYC apartment, worries endlessly about finding “the one.” With phenomenal actors such as Neil Patrick Harris, “How I Met Your Mother” joins the ranks of a perfect comfort binge as long as you stop before the last season.  
“Scrubs”
There are many aspects of this show that make it so darn heartwarming — including how main character J.D., a medical intern, attempts to win the friendship of Chief of Medicine Dr. Cox, plots shenanigans with his best friend and fellow intern Turk and endlessly tries to woo “the girl” Elliot. “Scrubs’’ has more dimension than merely being the comedic version of “Grey’s Anatomy.” If you’re into hopeless daydreaming or good old-fashioned slapstick comedy, give “Scrubs” a chance and see why you’ll be wishing you were checking into Sacred Heart Hospital.
Amazon Prime Video
“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”
Set in the 1950s, this show follows Miriam “Midge” Maisel, a housewife-turned-comedian in the aftermath of her husband cheating on her. Following an unlikely friendship with club owner Susie Myerson, the two make quite the dynamic duo and set off on making Maisel the star she has the potential to become. This show is fresh and vibrant, featuring plenty of wit and charm. If you’re looking for a show with a myriad of zingers, tight stand-up sets and commentary on the “ideal American housewife,” this is the show for you. 
“Fleabag” 
In truly the most absurd and raunchy comedy show to arise in recent memory, “Fleabag” is the brain-child of Phoebe Waller-Bridge, as creator, writer and star of the show. Based on her play of the same name, the main character, Fleabag, is seemingly lost (and horny) after grappling with the death of her best friend. In a show that portrays a profoundly honest portrayal of loneliness and femininity in the 21st century, this show routinely breaks the third wall as commentary on the façade of coping mechanisms. With two seasons, each explores completely different storylines: If you’re looking for one of the best yet most painful love stories out now that features a hot priest, give Season 2 a watch. 
“Psych”
Looking for a funny version of “Criminal Minds” or “The Mentalist?” This is the show for you. Shawn Spencer is a police consultant that routinely solves crimes with pure brain power that he deceives others into believing to be his psychic ability. This show is notable for developing complex character arcs and creating high stakes in each and every episode. Often finding himself in dangerous situations, Spencer is scrappy and always up to find the humor in a situation —  even if it involves a dead body.
HBO Max
“Barry”
Loved for his work on Saturday Night Live, and especially for his character Stefon, Bill Hader is the Renaissance man of this dark comedy show, as he wrote, produced, directed and starred in it.  “Barry” features a Midwestern hit man who turns to acting in light of a profound identity crisis. Viewers can enjoy a new side of Hader, as his performance deviates from his typical impersonations and rather develops a brooding, awkward, fledgling artist with awkward charm. 
“Veep” 
Comedic virtuoso Julia Louis-Dreyfus stuns audiences with her narcissistic, Machiavellian and farcical portrayal of the United States’ first female Vice President. In this political satire, Sorkin-esque political situations are twisted to the most extreme and absurd state possible (e.g. Season 5, Episode 6: C**tgate) as the show follows the perfectly incompotent administration of Selina Meyer. Following her pursuit of power, which without failure topples every other aspect of her life, Vice President Meyer is excruciatingly hilarious and never fails to land an explicit joke or two.

“I took time to look inward and really think about what I want to accomplish with my art. I want to enlighten, entertain and give food for thought.” 
Here, Karen Amy Finkel Fishof, a local contemporary artist whose art is prominently featured on the walls of USC Fisher Museum of Art’s newest exhibition, perfectly sums up how it feels to experience “Art and Hope at the end of the tunnel.”
After being closed for over a year (despite briefly reopening in April for a small feature on Dan McCleary), the Fisher Museum revealed “Art and Hope at the End of the Tunnel,” on Sept. 10. The exhibition, curated by Edward Goldman, an art critic and the host of NPR’s “Art Talk”, is centered around art created during the coronavirus pandemic. It serves as an uplifting reminder that art holds power and can be healing in tragic times. 
The space itself is a wonderful environment to view art. Artists’ quotes ornament the crisp white walls that support each hanging piece. By showcasing artists of color and creators from a variety of unique backgrounds, it’s clear that the exhibition celebrates diversity within the contemporary art world. 
Though the Fisher Museum features art of many different mediums (including amazing quilted tapestries and more abstracted collages), the exhibition excels most in its presentation of various portraits. The portraits displayed a range from Damian Elwes’ Basquiat-inspired canvas to Simon Toparovsky’s futuristic-looking cast aluminum busts and Ken Gonzales-Day’s collection of “Pandemic Portraits” depicting fellow artists, models and friends. 
One of the most striking artworks is Brendan Lott’s series of photographs. In these candid images, Lott illustrates beauty and pain in banal existence and the joys and trials of daily life during the pandemic. Inspired by his actual neighbors, the pictures feel as if we recognize the subjects within ourselves — a man making his bed, a woman staring at her phone, an unidentifiable figure reclining on their couch, another singing David Guetta’s “Titanium” on her TV’s karaoke.
In these scenes, there is an ever-present sense of fear, defeat, joy, exhaustion, but most importantly, endurance. Lott reminds us through his work. The pandemic had an emotional and physical toll on many people, and the act of simply enduring these difficult times is something to take pride in and celebrate.
In addition to its focus on portraits, the exhibition also highlights political art. Leo Marmol celebrates his heritage in his series of American and Cuban flag paintings while John Nava’s oil on paper display commemorates a migrant child who faced grave injustice at the Southern border. In choosing such a young subject, Nava recognizes this devastating reality but also reminds the viewer of younger generations and their hope for a better life, ultimately urging the public to support establishing a more humane immigration system. 
Other works focus more on the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020. Mark Steven Greenfield’s religious pieces were particularly extraordinary. In his paintings, Black individuals represent several biblical characters in idol-like forms, repurposing the ancient Byzantine style and reclaiming central Christian figures as an integral part of modern Black history. The artist describes this series as “representations of new beginnings,” which perfectly complements the exhibition’s overarching inspiration. 
Some of the political commentary does not really fit the theme though. For instance, Keiko Fukazawa’s porcelain profiles of tyrannical leaders, such as Mao Zedong and Donald Trump, miss the mark, focusing more on unequivocal failures in leadership and not enough on a path forward into a better future. While they are well-executed, these ironic commemorative plates do not go well with the idea of hope.
There is a great balance of light-hearted and serious art in the exhibition. While many of the aforementioned works deal with important issues, one piece in particular sticks out as refreshingly playful. Karon Davis’ sculpture titled “Quarantini,” employs a cheeky play on words and shows a woman nonchalantly holding a coral martini glass garnished with an olive. This demonstrates how even in the midst of quarantine, people still found ways to enjoy themselves.
“Art and Hope at the End of the Tunnel” provides a surreal escape from the pandemic, embraces recent profound socio-political movements and acknowledges the beauty of introspective contemplation and the newfound appreciation for life that many artists found over the past year and a half in quarantine. 
“Art and Hope at the End of the Tunnel” is on view until Dec. 4, 2021.
