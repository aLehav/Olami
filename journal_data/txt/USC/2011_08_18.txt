Senior guard Jio Fontan was supposed to be the unquestioned leader for the USC men’s basketball team this year.
Now, he’s out for the season.
“It’s a blow for our team,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill told the Los Angeles Times. “It’s a huge blow for our team.”
After landing awkwardly in an exhibition game in Brazil on Tuesday, Fontan flew back to Los Angeles to have an MRI on his knee where it was discovered he had torn his ACL.
Before the injury, Fontan led USC in scoring in Brazil, notching 29 points and 28 points respectively during USC’s five-game preseason tour of the country.
Fontan transferred to USC last season after playing at Fordham. After becoming eligible, he was instrumental in the Trojans’ second-half surge that landed them in the “First Four” round of the NCAA tournament.
He was one of two returning starters for a team that lost forward Alex Stepheson, guard Marcus Simmons and forward Nikola Vucevic to the NBA.
With Fontan out, sophomore guard Maurice Jones will likely assume point guard duties, with transfer junior guard Greg Allen, freshman Byron Wesley and freshman Alexis Moore vying for the other starting spot.

Coach: Kyle Whittingham
2010: 10-3 (7-1 in the Mountain West Conference)
Returning starters: Seven (offense), five (defense)
Beginning its first season in the newly formed Pac-12, Utah looks to continue its recent run of success after going 33-3 over the last three seasons, including a Sugar Bowl victory over Alabama in 2009. Perhaps most importantly, though, the Utes return their highly regarded junior quarterback Jordan Wynn, who threw for 17 touchdowns in 2010 despite missing the team’s first three games.
The biggest question mark surrounding the Utes this season will be how well they adapt to their new offense, as they move from the spread to the west coast offense following the arrival of celebrated offensive coordinator Norm Chow. And potentially even more pressing: How will they fare against Pac-12 defenses?
Defensively at least, the Utes seem to be set. The unit gave up just 20.3 points per game last season, good for 24th nationally, and returns six starters, highlighted by linebacker Chaz Walker, who led the team with 133 tackles.

Coach: Jerry Kill
2010: 3-9 (2-6 in the Big Ten)
Returning starters: Six (offense), eight (defense)
Following appearances in the Insight Bowl in 2008 and 2009, Minnesota fell on hard times last season, finishing with three wins and a coaching change. Now, new coach Jerry Kill, hired in December, looks to rescue the Golden Gophers from the Big Ten cellar. Kill’s first challenge in Minneapolis remains how to replace the program’s all-time leading passer in Adam Weber, who graduated last spring after throwing 20 touchdowns as a senior in 2010.
Taking over for Weber under center will likely be junior MarQueis Gray, who moves from wide receiver to quarterback.
The hope is that Gray, regarded as a fantastic athlete, will provide a spark for a team that ranked 89th nationally in scoring with 23.2 points per game. Running backs DeLeon Eskridge and Duane Bennett also return. Both accumulated over 500 rushing yards apiece last season.
