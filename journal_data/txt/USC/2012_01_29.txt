Life can sometimes feel like a constant struggle to stay the course.  For redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller, this idea held true. Coming out of high school, he knew he wanted to play college basketball, and he knew he could do it at a high level.  All he needed was the chance.  So when the University of Iowa was the only school from a major conference to recruit him, he decided to play there.
High scoring · Since transferring to USC and sitting out for a season, redshirt junior forward Aaron Fuller has become a team leader with an average of 15.2 points and 6 rebounds per game. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
But after two stellar seasons, Iowa’s coach Todd Lickliter was fired, leaving Fuller in a state of uncertainty. He decided it was time for a change.  At the conclusion of his sophomore year, Fuller decided to transfer to USC.  After all, the decision seemed fairly straightforward: The Trojans were coming off their fourth NCAA Tournament appearance in five years, and the campus was far closer to his hometown of Mesa, Ariz. than Iowa City.
“I really wanted to keep playing basketball at a high level at a big conference,” Fuller said. “I wanted to be closer to home.  I have a lot of family out here. USC is a great university and I just wanted to be a part of the tradition.”
After sitting out the 2010-2011 season because of NCAA rules, Fuller started the season right back on track. Through his first six games, Fuller became a team leader with an average of 15.2 points and 6 rebounds per game.
But after what seemed to be the beginning of another strong season, Fuller was again derailed by unforeseen adversity.
“The [shoulder] injury started since the beginning of the season,” Fuller said. “I was kind of just grinding through most of the season and then just hit a point where I wasn’t able to really help my teammates out.
“Over time, it just got worse and worse.”
As the season progressed, Fuller’s production declined. An already undersized big man at a listed height of six-foot-six, Fuller found it far more difficult to play against bigger opponents at less than full strength.
“It’s physical in the paint, so I wasn’t able to use my full strength and go up and get rebounds.  It really did affect my play.”
The Trojans began the season already without their starting point guard in senior Jio Fontan, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament during the summer, and sophomore forward Curtis Washington, who also suffered a torn labrum. Already depleted, the team began the year with an all-hands-on-deck mentality that stretched what little depth the roster had to begin with. In the end, though, the strain on Fuller’s shoulder was too much to bear.
“We decided to have the surgery right now so I could start the rehab process as soon as possible and get ready for summer workouts.”
With the losses beginning to pile up for USC (6-16, 1-8 Pac-12), the last thing the team needs is to lose its leading rebounder and second-leading scorer. And with only six active players averaging more than 15 minutes per game, USC coach Kevin O’Neill is going to have to scramble to find a player (or players) to fill the void left by Fuller in the front court.
Early candidates who figure to see more playing time are sophomore forward Garrett Jackson and junior center James Blasczyk, who average 16.2 and 15.6 minutes per game, respectively.
As far as Fuller’s future is concerned, he remains optimistic. He and the Trojans have reason to be:  Despite having only one recruit signed on for next year, the team has plenty of newcomers projected to play next season. In addition to the expected return of injured players Fontan, Washington, and, of course, Fuller, transfer players Ari Stewart, a junior forward from Wake Forest, and Eric Wise, a senior forward from UC Irvine, are each expected to contribute right away next season.
Stewart averaged 8.5 points per game last season for the Deamon Deacons, and Wise finished his three seasons at UC Irvine ranked 11th in school history in scoring and 15th in rebounds. Those are the kind of numbers the Trojans will hope for next year, but are desperately in need of for the remainder of this season.
For now, O’Neill will have to settle for watching two of his most talented players only on the practice floor. Fuller, who went through the same situation a year ago, offers the two transfers advice on how to cope with not playing in games.
“I just tell them to keep working hard every day.  Sitting out was tough, not being able to help your teammates. But just keep focusing on next year, because before you know it, you’re going to be playing.”
And with a successful surgery and recovery, Fuller will be joining them, right back on track.

A little over a week ago, the USC Women of Troy were riding a five-game winning streak, looking like legitimate contenders for the Pac-12 crown.
Just off the mark · Freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama was held to just four points and seven rebounds against Utah. The Women of Troy shot just under 38 percent for the game and shot only six free throws. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Now they are looking for answers.
After their 55-63 road loss to Utah (10-10, 3-6) on Saturday, the Women of Troy (10-9, 5-4) have lost three consecutive games. USC now sits at fourth in the conference after being in second place earlier this month.
In a game dominated by runs from both teams, the Utes pulled away in the final minute of action to steal what seemed to be a sure USC victory when the Women of Troy began the game with a 17-0 run.
After USC sophomore forward Cassie Harberts’ free throws cut Utah’s late lead to three with 1:08 remaining, the Women of Troy misfired four times while the Utes sank five free throws to put the game out of reach.
To counter a slow first half, Utah scored 42 points on 54 percent shooting in the latter 20 minutes behind forward Michelle Plouffe’s game-high 21 points, which all came in the second half.
“We need to lock down on defense and get out on shooters,” Harberts said. “Plouffe had too many wide open shots, and she was one of the main reasons for their runs.”
After USC pieced together a 9-2 run for a nine-point lead following halftime, Plouffe dropped eight points in two and a half minutes, followed by three consecutive layups by forward Taryn Wicijowski to give Utah a five-point advantage.
The Women of Troy responded with a quick 7-2 run, highlighted by junior forward Christina Marinacci’s four-point play. The teams were deadlocked at 43 apiece with 9:29 remaining, but that was the closest USC would get for the rest of the game.
USC had hoped that a matchup against a team with the weakest record in the conference would help them bounce back from two narrow losses against Oregon State and Colorado in the past week.
“We feel like we need something to get us back up on our feet and to get our identity back, and we thought this game was going to be it,” Harberts said.
For the first nine and a half minutes of the game, it looked like a win was certain. USC held Utah scoreless on 0-for-12 shooting to start the game with an early 17-point lead.
Freshman guard Ariya Crook, who replaced injured senior guard Briana Gilbreath in the starting lineup, scored eight of her career-high 17 points during the run.
“Briana was out, so I had to step up,” Crook said. “I attacked the basket and tried to bring energy to the team.”
Nevertheless, Crook and her teammates could not stop Utah’s rapid turnaround.
Utah guard Iwalani Rodrigues ended her team’s early drought with an and-one layup, which sparked a 16-2 run that cut the Utes’ deficit to three.
The rest of the game featured similar Utah runs that USC’s premier defender Gilbreath could have helped slowed down.
Gilbreath, the team’s leader in blocks and steals per game, sat out with a knee injury sustained in the second half of USC’s 67-69 loss to Colorado last Thursday.
“In the second half, all of our energy just went down. We tried to catch up but it was too late,” Crook said. “We just have to improve on that and keep our energy up the whole game.”
With their two-game road trip wrapped up, the Women of Troy return home to face non-conference opponent UC Santa Barbara (8-11, 3-5) on Tuesday at 7 p.m.
 
What else can you say except a very sad turn of events. You can not blow a seventeen point lead against a mediocre team like Utah on the road or not. Another wasted year with seniors Corral, Gilbreath, Gemelos, and possibly Stephanie G. not returning for her senior redshirt year along with Michelle Jenkins. A big finish to the regular season and a run to the finals of the conference tournament needed to advance to the ncaa most likely.

After impressive performances against the University of Wisconsin last weekend, the Women of Troy were swept by top-ranked California and eighth-ranked Stanford in two very close meets over the weekend at McDonald’s Stadium.
These were the first two losses for USC this season, and for the seniors, the meets were the last ones at home in their careers.
Staying afloat · While the Women of Troy lost their weekend meets to California and Stanford, they still sit in a position to win the Pac-12 conference. They will face UCLA in two weeks in Westwood. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan
Against the Bears, senior Katinka Hosszu won the 200-yard backstroke, the 400-yard individual medley and was part of the winning 200-yard medley relay team, while senior diver Victoria Ishimatsu won the three-meter and one-meter diving events. It was not enough, however, to overcome the Bear’s combination of Caitlin Leverenz and Sara Isakovic, and the Women of Troy fell by a final score of 138-162.
While they lost the meet, USC had several individual winners. Besides Hosszu and Ishimatsu, Haley Anderson (1000-yard freestyle, 500-yard freestyle), and sophomore Kasey Carlson (100-yard breaststroke) won their competitions.
“Hosszu and Anderson were on top of their game,” head coach Dave Salo said, despite the close weekend losses.
There was no rest for the Women of Troy, as they faced Stanford the next day, who beat them by a final score of 160.5-139.5.
While Anderson (1000-yard freestyle), Hosszu (200-yard freestyle, 200-yard IM), Carlson (100-yard breaststroke), and senior Tanya Krisman (200-yard butterfly) were winners, the Cardinal could not be stopped and were led by Samantha Woodward and Maya Dirado.
The 400-yard freestyle relay was the difference betwen victory and defeat for the Women of Troy, as they lost by nearly five seconds to Stanford’s squad.
“Both meets were great in challenging our women,” Salo said. “[These losses] can only make us better for the Pac-12 championships and the NCAA championships.”
The Women of Troy will take on UCLA on Feb. 11 on the road. After that, USC will participate in the Pac-12 championships in late February  and in the NCAA championships in March.

The No. 5 USC men’s volleyball team split their weekend road trip, coming up with a loss at No. 2 UC Irvine and a win against UC San Diego.
The Trojans (4-3, 3-3 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) visited UC Irvine’s (7-2, 3-2) Bren Events Center on Friday night. The Anteaters took a 6-3 lead in the first set and never looked back, winning in four sets.
“I’m not really sure where the slow starts come from, but nobody really had a good night, and [UCI] had an unbelievable night,” said senior outside hitter and co-captain Tony Ciarelli. “We kind of wait for the game to come to us, see how it feels, see how the other team does things. We’ve always been strong at the end of games because everyone on the team is so competitive, but we need to work on how we start.”
The Anteater trio of opposite Carson Clark, outside hitter Jeremy Dejno and middle blocker Dan McDonnell served the Trojans tough all night. The Anteaters finished with a season-high eight aces — seven from Clark and  one from McDonnell. The Trojan passers had trouble controlling the barrage of tough serves, leading to a more predictable and unsuccessful offense. USC finished the match with a .234 hitting percentage — -almost a full tenth lower than Irvine’s.
“Clark and Dejno are two of the best servers in the league but McDonnell really killed us,” coach Bill Ferguson said. “Adding him to the serves from Dejno and Clark made it so that they had a great server every other rotation, and we just kept getting pelted all night.”
The Anteaters keyed on Ciarelli all night. The Trojans’ season kill leader had a team-high 14 kills but was held to an inefficient .105 rate.
“At times it looked like there were six guys on him,” Ferguson laughed. “But he had all three front row blockers on him lots of times. Because he was forced to hit so many high-balls, he was up against a solid block and was asked to do something near impossible in trying to score against that kind of defense.”
At UCSD, the Trojans ramped up their focus and won in a three-set sweep. Behind strong blocking and good ball control, the Trojans regained their composure.
“Our team responded great,” Ferguson said. “We learned from our experience last night [at UCI] and then moved on. I was very proud of how we bounced back last night.”
Redshirt sophomore opposite Tanner Jansen finished with a team-high 14 kills and finished with a .417 rate. Redshirt junior Jeff Carlson replaced Jansen at opposite at UCI after one set, but Jansen started against UCSD and played the whole match.
Carlson’s play as the fiery do-it-all solution off the bench proved to be valuable in both matches.
“I just wanted to come in to the game against UCI and bring some fire,” Carlson said. “I just want to do whatever I can to help the team. It doesn’t matter if it’s opposite or outside hitter. I just enjoy being on the court.”

Let it now be said that when it comes to recruiting and reeling in decorated high school prospects, Lane Kiffin knows what he’s doing.
There have been a number of criticisms directed toward the Trojans’ 36-year-old coach in recent years, but just about anyone, including his detractors, will concede the following: he can recruit with the best of them.
Recent seasons only prove testament to that notion.
Last February, 30 players signed with USC despite the fact that there would be no possibility of participating in a bowl game in their first season on campus. The class, nonetheless, was ranked No. 4 overall in the country by Yahoo Sports’ Rivals.com.
In 2010, the Trojans signed 20 commits -— the No. 1 class, according to Rivals.com. Perhaps even more impressive was that Kiffin and his staff had arrived at USC less than a month before national signing day and retained many of the same players who had originally committed to play for then-coach Pete Carroll.
But this season might prove to be the toughest test for the Trojans’ heralded staff. And yes, you can of course attribute that to scholarship reductions, stemming from NCAA sanctions.
This winter, roster management will become increasingly important for the program, and precision will be more necessary than ever.
As outlined by the infractions report from June 2010, USC cannot sign more than 15 players for the class of 2012, excluding early enrollees who count toward the 2011 class. And by next fall, it can carry no more than 75 scholarship players on its roster.
How the staff handles that remains a delicate balance.
With national signing day on Wednesday, USC still intends to sign a full class, which in this case happens to be 15 as opposed to the typical 25 for fall enrollees.
But bringing in 15 freshmen next August is more complicated than simply receiving faxed and signed letters of intent.
For starters, USC currently has 66 scholarship players on its roster — excluding senior cornerback T.J. Bryant and sophomore safety Patrick Hall who have reportedly left the program, and senior defensive end Armond Armstead, who is unlikely to be cleared by the school’s medical staff. Armstead is expected to either transfer to another school for his senior season or declare for the NFL’s supplemental draft in the summer.
That means in order to sign 15, six players need to go before fall camp. How that will happen remains to be seen.
One method is for Kiffin and his staff to take away players’ scholarships, which are renewable annually. In that case, former walk-ons, junior linebacker Will Andrew, senior cornerback Tony Burnett and senior center Abe Markowitz, could all see their scholarships revoked.
Another option to dwindle down to 75 would be for players to transfer, presumably players low enough on the depth chart. Who leaves, though, remains unknown.
Rumors have circulated for weeks that sophomore quarterback Jesse Scroggins could be a likely candidate. The Lakewood, Calif., native was not at the team’s unofficial throwing session last Thursday. Though, Scroggins’ status with the program remains — to some degree — speculative at this point.
But the toughest part largely centers around who USC will sign. With fewer and fewer scholarship offerings, USC can’t afford to miss on highly regarded prospects. And don’t think Kiffin, in spite of his recruiting pedigree, hasn’t missed before.
Two years ago, USC signed a total of five five-star prospects: wide receiver Markeith Ambles, running back Dillon Baxter, offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson, wide receiver Kyle Prater and wide receiver Robert Woods.
Since then, Ambles left the program, Baxter transferred to San Diego State, Henderson was released from his letter of intent and never played a down at USC and Prater transferred to Northwestern.
It is probably worth noting at this point, and fair to point out, Woods turned out OK.
But the point remains: Recruiting is an inexact science, at best.
When typically signing classes around 25 players per year, there is added flexibility. If one running back happens to leave, that’s fine as there are two or three more in that particular class.
That luxury, however, isn’t afforded to USC. It can’t afford to miss. It can’t afford to sign a player who is not able to stay academically eligible. It can’t afford to sign a player who doesn’t develop, either.
There is little room for error this time around — even for Lane Kiffin.

The USC men’s basketball team put an end to a nine-game losing streak on Saturday night with a decisive 62-45 victory over the Utah Utes (5-16, 2-7) at the Galen Center. The Trojans improved to 6-16 on the season and picked up their first Pac-12 win in nine attempts.
Worth the wait · Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson scored 16 points in Saturday’s win against the Utes. Sophomore guard Maurice Jones chipped in 16 of his own as the Trojans shot 48 percent from the field overall. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
 
“The two groups I’m happy for are our players and our fans,” coach Kevin O’Neill said. “I thought our guys did a good job tonight of digging in there.”
USC was paced by strong performances from sophomore forward Garrett Jackson and sophomore guard Maurice Jones, who poured in 16 points apiece. Junior guard Greg Allen and freshman guard Byron Wesley added nine points each, and freshman guard Alexis Moore finished with eight points of his own.
“We knew we had to get a win,” Jackson said. “We felt like our backs were against the wall.”
The Trojans eclipsed 60 points for the seventh time this season, an achievement aided by all-around unselfish play.
“We shared the ball; 16 assists is the most we’ve had in a long time,” O’Neill said.

Utah had three players finish in double-figures, led by forward Dijon Farr’s 12 points. They struggled to shoot the ball during the contest, though, finishing 18-49 (36.7 percent) and just 3-15 from beyond the arc. Further complicating matters was their passing, as the Utes had five assists compared to 17 turnovers.
“I thought our guys did a really good job defensively, forced some early turnovers that led to easy baskets,” O’Neill said.
The Trojans jumped out to a 13-2 lead midway through the first half, initially hitting their first four field goal attempts. The hot start was a far cry from USC’s effort against Colorado two days earlier, in which the Buffaloes established an early advantage that they never relinquished.
“I’m just happy we won,” Jackson said. “It’s been so frustrating for everyone for so long. I’m just ready to keep building on this.”
Putting an end to what had been USC’s longest losing streak in more than 20 years was a major boost for the team.
“These guys are happy obviously to win,” O’Neill said. “I’m sure they’re still disappointed that we’ve had the number of losses we’ve had. I think they’re relieved too. I’ll be honest with you, I’m relieved.”
Only six of USC’s players are on a scholarship following a season-ending injury to redshirt sophomore forward Dewayne Dedmon, who tore his medial collateral ligament against Colorado. Even with a depleted roster, the Trojans hope to expand on what was their third double-digit victory of the season.
“It has definitely been frustrating to see your teammates go down with injuries … but our guys know we can’t fall apart,” Jackson said. “We’ve got to stick together and be there for one another.”
Next up for USC is a trip up the West Coast to take on the Washington State Cougars (11-10, 3-6) on Feb. 2 followed by the Washington Huskies (14-7, 7-2) two days later.
“We’ve actually played better on the road than we have at home,” O’Neill said. “We’ve not been a good home team energy-wise, we were better tonight. So hopefully we can go up there and play a great basketball game and try to get a win.”

USC Pharmacy is developing a web-based application that will allow patrons to order their prescriptions electronically.
The online application will allow customers to place refill orders and to check the status of their prescription from any computer or smartphone. The application will also alert users when their prescription is ready for pick-up.

This shift toward a web-based operating system is an effort to meet the needs of busy USC students and faculty who are perpetually on the go, said University Park Campus Pharmacy Director Kari Trotter.
“Times are changing and we need to keep up with our changing population,” Trotter said. “We are always looking for ways to accommodate our patients and their needs.”
Though the wait time for a prescription to be processed is approximately 30 minutes for medication that is in stock and one day for out-of-stock, a customer will now know exactly when to pick up the pre-ordered prescription.
“We are very excited about this opportunity to service our customers as we realize that most people are looking for easier ways to handle their day-to-day business and not be slowed down,” Trotter said.
The application, which will be completed mid-semester, will be available for free on iPhones and Androids. The application will also allow customers to easily access their prescription records.

Steve Proffitt, an adjunct professor of journalism, never intended to go into journalism.
Originally trained as a studio artist, the self-proclaimed “news junkie,” began his career by applying to make art for his local PBS station, KERA, in Texas.
“I fell into it,” Proffitt said. “I literally went to a public television station and they hired me as a producer and reporter — those were different times.”

And though news isn’t traditionally a field for artists, Proffitt tells his students to strive for innovation — in identifying potential stories, thinking about who to speak to and who to interview, approaching interviews and presenting information.
“I try to stress the creative nature of journalism,” Proffitt said. “I approach it as a creative act and try to teach it as a creative activity.”
He said two things surprised him when he started teaching, the first one being that many of his students don’t always follow the news the way he does. Classes begin with a discussion of current events, something his students sometimes struggle with at the start.
“Sometimes it takes a few weeks for them to even understand what I’m looking for,” Proffitt said. “They may come in with things that they read in Gawker or some sort of entertainment site, but I want what’s going on in Syria and Sacramento.”
Part of this might come from his formative years consuming media.
“When I was in college, it was the Vietnam War, Watergate and the civil rights movement,” Proffitt said. “There were a lot of big things happening.”
The predominance of women in his classes also surprised him, as the number of women journalists continues to rise.
Before coming to USC, Proffitt had not taught journalism in an academic setting, but he said that teaching is a rewarding experience.
“It’s given me some optimism about the future because I meet and work with students who I think have a real future as journalists and who, even if they don’t become journalists, will do good and important things,” Proffitt said. “When you work in the news business, it’s pretty easy to become cynical and pessimistic.”
Though the print reporting classes he teaches focus on television, Proffitt said he prefers radio journalism.
[Correction: A previous version of this story said Proffitt taught broadcast classes. He teaches print reporting. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
“I like print and I like TV, but I’m a radio guy,” Proffitt said. “It’s the medium I’ve been working in the longest and I’m the most comfortable with and, ultimately, it’s the most intimate.”
Proffitt practices what he prefers, serving as a producer and reporter for the Madeleine Brand Show, an hourlong news show on KPCC.
“She’s [Madeleine] a great interviewer: smart, fun and funny,” Proffitt said. “From a professional standpoint, I’m just pretty much as happy as I’ve ever been.”
Each day before work, Proffitt wakes up at 4:30 a.m. and grabs a cup of coffee to sip through the major news of the day.
“Following stories is interesting. A ship crashes off the coast of Italy, or Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich are getting involved in a more and more acrimonious duel — every morning I want to find out what happens,” Proffitt said. “I can’t help it. It’s what I like and I love what I do.”
While creativity is certanly a worthy trait for journalists to have, the recent question by the NYT public editor (Should The Times Be a Truth Vigilante?) painfully highlights the fact that a taste for and dedication to the truth shoud be pretty high up there somewhere as well.
As has been said, you’re entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts.

The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences’ economics department opened a computerized research lab to study economic decision-making.
Experiments are set to begin this semester once the lab has built a large enough subject pool, said Juan Carillo, a professor of economics.
The Los Angeles Behavioral Economics Laboratory in Kaprielian Hall will use its 36 computer terminals to record subjects’ decision-making strategies.
Carrillo is one of the core faculty members for LABEL. He said the lab will give USC the ability to run a variety of experiments.
Researchers can test, for example, how individuals respond to risk and how games of strategy work depending on the actions of multiple people.
LABEL’s purpose is two-fold because it can train students in research practice while generating data.
Carrillo said students will be able to run their own experiments and to gain valuable hands-on research experience.
Though Carrillo acknowledges that these experiments could be run in other labs, such as those at UCLA or Cal Tech, “the quality and amount of experiments would not be comparable to having an in-house lab.”
The economics department hopes to expand the lab to include equipment capable of recording physiological reactions, Carrillo said, making it one of the only research facilities in the United States with this comprehensive structure.
“It would put USC on the frontier of research and experiments,” Carrillo said.
Nazmul Ahsan, a graduate student studying economics, said he looks forward to conducting his own research in a lab that will set USC apart from other research universities.
Ahsan said that, because economists analyze the behavior of economic issues through theory and theories need to be tested before they are applied, the lab will let him look at theory put into practice.
“It’s a great opportunity,” Ahsan said. “It’s good to have a lab here because many universities do not have one at all.”
Student researchers will be required to go through the process of building experiment models, developing software, running multiple experiments and analyzing the resulting data.
According to Carrillo, student involvement is a vital aspect of running the lab. He said the economics department plans to train students in experimental techniques and further expand on classroom concepts.
“Students can see how theories they learn in class apply in practice,” Carrillo said.
LABEL was built in honor of Jean-Jacques Laffont, a French economist who came to USC in 2001 with the intention of instituting improvements and advancements in the department. He had hoped to one day build an experimental lab at USC, but died in 2004.
“He was such a great figure,” Carrillo said. “We thought it would be appropriate to honor him.”

After the recent release of James Franco’s preview of Undergrads, USC’s reputation as a school full of sex-crazed party animals will surely persist. But when it comes to sex, what is the truth about USC students?
It might appear that casual sexual counters are the norm at USC. However, according to the USC Office of Wellness and Health Promotion’s data from the American College Health Association, 80 percent of students at USC reported having between zero and one sexual partners in the past year.
[Correction: A previous version of this article attributed the above study to the American Health Care Association. The American College Health Association reported the statistic. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
In our discussions at USC, it is important to keep an open mind about sex. USC students should feel free to talk about sex, pleasure and health openly — and not only in the context of that crazy party last Friday.
According to the Center for Disease Control, 79.5 percent of college students ages 18 to 24 have had some kind of sexual experience. But more than 20 percent of students have never engaged in sexual behavior.
Navigating the issues of sexuality, romance and intimacy are some of the key challenges of being a college student. But the recent spotlight on USC gives people the idea that the people having sex are heavy partiers and academic underachievers, to name a few stereotypes.
This approach to sex doesn’t address the facts: Many different people have sex for many reasons. Excluding sex as a healthy lifestyle choice from the conversation contributes to misinformation.
According to the ACHA survey, only about half of college students nationwide used a condom the last time they had sex. When we can’t talk about sex constructively, we are left with a lack of initiative and knowledge about how to have sex safely.
Students should feel comfortable with whatever level of sexual experience they have. We should also feel free to discuss safe sex practices or non-mainstream sexual preferences with our partners on a regular basis.

When was the last time you used a laptop?
Whether students type an essay in Microsoft Word, scroll through an article in PDF form or compile notes in Google Docs, technology serves as an integral part of our day-to-day college lives.
Naturally, when professors issue a “no laptops allowed” classroom policy, many students become discouraged.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
We understand why they do it, as laptops are often considered a distraction. But as technology develops, it becomes increasingly intertwined with education. Instructors who don’t allow laptops in the classroom are behind the times.
Many professors argue that laptops are distracting. But let’s consider why students become tempted to hop on Facebook or to chat with friends in the first place — in many cases, they simply aren’t engaged in class.
Two-hour-long oral lectures and 50-slide PowerPoint decks full of black-and-white text do not keep students’ attention.
In many fields, the online sphere defines the future of the industry. Banning technology in the classroom sends conflicting messages about that development.
Banning technology assumes that the only solution to students’ short attention spans is the removal of distractions.
Students will inevitably face those same distractions as professionals once they enter the workforce. Rather than accusing laptops of being distracting, professors should use technology to their advantage to make classes more engaging.
A recent study by the Southern Cross University in Australia found that Twitter helps shy students share their ideas in the classroom and encourages class participation.
In the study, students anonymously tweeted their comments on class material and those comments showed up on their professors’ laptops via PowerPoint. In this manner, professors used laptops to engage students rather than distract them.
At a recent conference for journalism educators, Robert Hernandez, an assistant professor of professional practice, monitored a live Twitter feed, illustrating its ability to enrich conversation and encourage idea generation.
Twitter is a great example, but it’s only a starting point. Professors can brainstorm other ways to engage students through the use of online collaboration and technology tools.
Though USC does not have an official policy on laptops in the classroom, President C. L. Max Nikias recently mentioned in KPCC Radio’s “What is the Future of Higher Education?” roundtable discussion that USC has prioritized the integration of new technology into the classroom environment.
As part of this strategy, the university has added courses that weave interactive components into the usual lectures.
The responsibility of avoiding distractions on laptops, however, lies solely in students’ hands. Though it’s not a crime to discretely send a time-sensitive email in class, it’s another thing to spend an entire lecture scrolling through Facebook. Even if we opt to use our laptops, professors deserve our attention and respect.
Technology in the classroom is ultimately a two-way street. Professors must adopt it in a way that engages students and teaches them the material, and students should actively participate and not abuse laptop privileges in class.
Whether professors decide to allow laptops or not, they cannot deny that laptops are an increasingly essential part of student life.
If professors look to technology as a potential medium for improving the classroom experience rather than hampering it, both parties will benefit.

Totally agree with Jon. The millenial generation is pathetic – you can’t lend your time to someone else to try and learn something during an hour and a half session? What’s the matter, those “rigorous” BUAD classes not exciting enough for you?
This is idiotic. It isn’t up to professors to ENTERTAIN you. You need to make an effort to learn. Going on facebook before the prof even opens his mouth is not making an effort. And it happens ALL THE TIME. And, unlike the doodling of older generations of students, surfing the web during class is distracting to other students.

Any walk in Los Angeles presents plenty of doors — doors to bars, stores, museums and everything in between. For Angelenos it’s about choosing to walk through doors that will open up a world that transports them from city sidewalks and into completely different environments. And if you’re willing to drive a little, you can discover a lot more.
French Quarter restaurant in West Hollywood proves to be one of those places particularly adept at making visitors feel as if they’ve been transported to a new place, one entirely different from the restaurant’s surrounding city. If you’re just whizzing past in a car, you might notice the covered patio area for eating, each window decorated with a stained glass fleur-de-lis. Open since 1974, the restaurant is a quaint space located inside a congregation of shops called French Market Place.
The restaurant takes its name from the iconic neighborhood in New Orleans, Louisiana, called the French Quarter. Home to Bourbon Street, a popular tourist destination, French Quarter remains a fun place with plenty of culture for visitors to take in any time of the year.
So it’s no surprise that French Quarter Marketplace, and the restaurant inside of it, have plenty to enjoy, too. Once the front doors close on the hustle and bustle of  Santa Monica Boulevard, visitors find themselves immersed in a buzzing, welcoming atmosphere.
Before you give the hostess the number of your party, take a stroll around the marketplace. A fountain with surrounding bricks allows you to sit and watch the wall fall on fish of all colors, some at impressively large sizes. If you ask the right person, or bring a cute younger sibling, you can get a handful of fish food to fling toward the creatures’ puckered mouths.
The space is decorated with white railings, quaint light fixtures, painted walls and individual paintings, creating an authentic experience. Additionally, there are businesses upstairs and downstairs, ranging from Psychic Lady to Marc Edward Skincare.
But simply sitting and grabbing a bite at the restaurant is an experience in itself. The space is filled with cozy tables with white tablecloths or you can choose a seat at the bar. If you’re looking for more intimate seating, you can ask to be seated in a small section upstairs that is set apart from the rest of the restaurant.
What you order will depend on what time you decide to visit. The brunch offers the usual staples, like omelettes and eggs but with clever names.
You can order a Mardi Gras omelette, a blend of turkey, avocado, bacon and jack cheese. If you have a seafood craving, you can ask for the crabcake benedict, which comes with an orange cilantro hollandaise sauce. And if you’re 21, you can wash it down with a mimosa.
The menu for the remainder of the day contains expected items like sandwiches, hamburgers and pasta. Its versatility makes it easy for virtually everyone in a group to find something that hits the spot. The sandwiches alone can appease a variety of eaters. On the lighter side is a half sandwich of tuna, turkey salad or turkey with sliced fruit that is just the right size if you don’t want a large meal.
On the heavier side is a conejo sandwich which, despite the English translation of its name to rabbit, consists of steak paired with coleslaw, tomato, lettuce, avocado, grilled mushrooms and onion on a french baguette. And even if you just want to order a tea, it’ll still come with a cutesy teapot of hot water for you to pour at your leisure. There is no rush, or pressure to order large amounts of food.
That’s perhaps the greatest charm about the marketplace; it welcomes you to visit if you aren’t planning on chowing down on a hefty entree. Its easy and acceptable to chat and laugh loudly.
On any given day, the restaurant’s visitors range greatly in age, which is a testament to the fact that the space lends itself for a date, a mother-daughter bonding session, or lunch out with a little cousin. You can park in the locale’s lot or around the street at meters. If you have time, walk up and down the nearby streets and you’ll find even more behind its doors. The French Quarter is just more assurance that, if you look hard enough, Los Angeles and its surrounding areas are anything but boring.
 
French Quarter Restaurant is located on 7985 Santa Monica Blvd.

Writing songs for its next album, recording demos in the studio and playing the Echoplex in Los Angeles on Jan. 31 — Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.’s success story ultimately owes itself to a development of trust and steady artistic progression for Daniel Zott and Josh Epstein, who comprise the duo.

“Josh Epstein and I knew each other for a little while, but we never thought to work together,” Zott said.  “He heard that I came out with a solo record. He liked it and wanted to finish a song with me to see what happened.”
The product of this first meeting? The band’s breakout hit “Simple Girl,” which incorporates strong Simon & Garfunkel influenced harmonies over Epstein and Zott’s effortlessly catchy instrumental arrangements.
Even though the two make “Simple Girl” sound so simple, Zott admits it took time to adjust to working with another artist.
“When he called me, I was sort of reluctant at first. We’re creating music. There’s a level of trust that you need to have,” Zott said.  “I respected his music, but you never know what it’s going to be like writing with someone.”
But after recording “Simple Girl,” Zott was sure: “We just kind of knew that ‘Man, OK, this is good. We should keep doing this.’”
Before the two had any idea what was happening, they had already completed an EP and attracted a loyal fan base. “It’s just a natural progression that we didn’t really expect,” Zott said. “We didn’t set out to be a band. We just started recording songs that people were liking. So, when that happens, you’re dumb to not jump on that opportunity — and we did.”
Epstein and Zott began brainstorming band names, such as Counting Crows Part II and other goofy titles that encompassed the idea of two silly guys jamming than a marketable band persona.
Even close friends, however, weren’t too keen on a name that read like a sequel to another band.
“One of our buddies was like, ‘That’s so stupid you might as well name yourself Dale Earnhardt Jr. Jr.’ And we realized that’s actually pretty sweet,” Zott said with a chuckle.
The two bandmates took the name and made something of it. Zott suggests that the name allowed the band to “present art in different formats” by dressing up in racing outfits and “being totally weird and then letting the music contrast with the way our name sounds.”
Apparently, even the real Dale Earnhardt Jr. applauded the name.
“Finding out that Dale Earnhardt [Jr.] wasn’t coming out after us and was actually really supportive made us excited to have a name like that,” Zott said.
In the summer of 2011, the band released its first full-length album, It’s A Corporate World. From the thumping drums of the record’s opening track “Morning Thought,” the album boldly makes a statement concerning the band’s core philosophy — the juxtaposition of the shallow and intimate.
“We have an outward surface-level appearance of being silly and being kind of simple. The reality is that every person is complex. We have complexities to us and we have songs that talk about a lot of crazy stuff that I think is important and poetic,” Zott said.
One issue that the band explores, for example, is evident in the title of its first album.
“Some of our reflections are that corporations are everywhere and everything is advertising — even ourselves,” Zott said, citing Facebook as an example of personal marketing. “We all see the world as a sort of business. That’s just how it is. There’s a greatness with corporations, but there’s also some annoying, destructive traits about them too. We’re just trying to start a conversation.”
Epstein and Zott have gotten involved in the conversation as well. Basing the decision on Zott’s philosophy that “life has so many different facts,” the band released not one, but two videos for the song “Nothing But Our Love.”  One was expectedly quirky — “weird, goofy and funny,” as Zott puts it. But the second video resulted from a trip to the village of Sólheimar, located in Iceland, where the duo highlighted the story of a woman who had created the village as a place where residents could be free from all stereotypes and judgment.
“The government was telling her to fill the walls between the people so that there would be a separation between the mentally handicapped children and the ‘regular children.’ She didn’t want to do that,” Zott explained. “She was doing something amazing, saying these mentally handicapped children have value in a time when people were saying that they don’t.”
While the two made a statement with their story in Sólheimar, Zott doesn’t hold social responsibility as his duty as an artist. He did, however, find a connection between art and social commentary.
“If you’re an artist and you’re a human being and you’re trying to say something, you should be talking about what’s going on in the world and what you’re feeling,” he said. “You don’t do it on purpose. It just comes out.”
