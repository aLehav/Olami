Admission decisions for USC’s Class of 2023 were mailed to students last week, barely a week after the University’s implication at the forefront of the largest college admissions bribery scandal in history. The investigation has placed national scrutiny onto the University, with many questioning the worth of a USC degree, especially in the wake of lawsuits and internal conflicts.
But chances of admission to USC have continued to dwindle. USC’s undergraduate applicant pool rose to a record 66,000 for the Class of 2023, according to a statement from the University. 
15 percent of newly accepted students are the first in their families to attend college, and 29.5 percent are underrepresented minorities, according to the statement. 
Multiple relatives of USC benefactors attend the school, including Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso’s daughter. Andre “Dr. Dre” Young deleted an Instagram post congratulating his daughter for being accepted to USC “all on her own” following comments that pointed out his shared endowment of $70 million to the Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy. 
But beyond the select few whose names grace the buildings and benches around campus, USC’s student body includes students from all 50 states and over 130 countries, according to USC Admission’s website. Students at USC speak hundreds of languages and take classes across 80 majors. Some have disabilities, some work multiple jobs, some commute hours every day and some even have children.
Here are three of their stories.
Luis Tun
In addition to applying to 14 colleges and universities in his senior year of high school, Luis Tun had a schedule comprising advanced English, history and science courses, his family moved at least five times, and — to top it all off — he didn’t own a printer. 
“A lot of low-income people don’t have access to a printer,” said Tun, a freshman majoring in political science. “Teachers would sometimes assume I [wasn’t] doing the work because there’s a certain perception that Latinos are part of gangs, or they don’t like school.”
Tun, who moved to Newbury Park, Calif., from the town of Muna in Yucatan, Mexico, when he was 6, is a recipient of the Norman Topping Scholarship, the only student-funded scholarship at USC for students from low-income backgrounds. 
He said when he was first accepted to USC, he couldn’t believe it. 
“It’s a first generation issue, where you don’t feel like you’re capable of being academically strong,” Tun said. “And I feel like there’s always a doubt that you’re not capable of doing what other students are.”
Tun said he had to learn about the college application process without the help of his parents. The academic barriers he faced in his community inspired him to educate others. He helped bring cultural sensitivity training programs to his high school, traveled around local schools to educate Latinx parents about the importance of higher education and advocated to lower the price of Advanced Placement testing in his district. 
This inspired him to pursue a degree in political science at USC, although he was initially interested in medicine.
“As soon as I started doing more advocacy work within my community, that pushed me to do more law and policy-making,” Tun said.
Tun was recently selected to receive financial aid from the Fisher Fellowship Program, Dornsife’s first program for first-generation, low-income students. 
Tun also qualifies for the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act — making him a DREAMer — which he said prevents him from applying to certain scholarships. Tun said he also receives money from DREAM Cal Grants, which provide financial aid to students in California. 
“It’s very difficult for me to apply for scholarships,” Tun said. “I always fit everything else — leadership, community service.” 
V Marks
After coming to the School of Cinematic Arts, V Marks said USC’s “culture of wealth” surprised them. 
“I feel like a lot of my experience at USC has been me learning how rich everyone I know is,” said Marks, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting. 
Marks spent their elementary, middle and high school years at a selective public school in New York City whose elementary school had a 2 percent acceptance rate in 2015, according to Business Insider. However, they were still shocked to find out they had been accepted to the top film school in the country.
“It was one of the best days of my life,” Marks said. “The whole college admissions game is such a nonsensical process that you just never really know. I guess I just thought I wasn’t good enough to get in.”
This academic year, Marks is working as a resident assistant in Birnkrant Residential College, which provides them with free housing and meals in exchange for approximately 20 hours a week of supervising residents and performing other responsibilities within the residential college. 
Marks is a member of Fourth Quarter All-Stars, a sketch comedy group on campus, as well as a writer for The Sack of Troy, USC’s satirical student newspaper. Last semester, they played the lead role of Alison Bechdel in Dorothy’s Friends Theatre Company’s production of “Fun Home,” an autobiography-turned-musical about Bechdel and her family. 
As the first person in their family to attend a private institution for college, Marks said they feel the pressure to make their family proud. 
“There’s this sense of [having to be] upwardly mobile every generation,” Marks said. “There’s definitely a sense of guilt whenever you don’t do well in something or you take free time for yourself.” 
Marks said they are motivated by the sacrifices their family has made — all the way back to their ancestors, who escaped religious persecution in Russia in the late-19th century. 
And while they said they weren’t surprised when they learned about the college admissions scandal, attending USC has taught them that privilege is a spectrum. 
“There isn’t a solid line that divides rich and poor,” Marks said. “We still have some privilege just to go here. Does anyone ever really get into a school on their own merit? There’s so many factors that come into play.”
Saran Kaba
The middle sister of five, Saran Kaba always knew she would go to the United States to get a degree in chemical engineering. But it wasn’t easy — after her parents sent her two older sisters to college in the U.S., her father had to work 15 hours a day for nearly two years so that Saran could go to school.
“From the outside world … especially in Africa, just coming to the U.S. is such a privilege,” said Kaba, who considers herself Pan-African after growing up in multiple African countries. 
Kaba, whose native language is French, transferred to USC after spending two years at Tarrant County College in Texas. She said she chose to first attend a smaller institution so that she could perfect her English and grow accustomed to living in the U.S.
Unlike her older sisters, Kaba was born in the U.S., so she qualifies for financial aid. She is currently a student worker at the Center for Interactive Smart Oilfield Technologies, and said that after graduating in May, she has a job lined up as a petroleum engineer in Nigeria. 
She said her status as a citizen made her confident that she would be able to support herself after moving to the U.S. at the end of 2013.
“I was telling [my parents] … as soon as I step on the plane, I’m going to take care of myself,” Kaba said. “Within the first five months that I came to the U.S., I found my first job. I wasn’t speaking perfect English, but then I was like, ‘I’ll do whatever it takes.’”
Kaba said she received a grant from the Viterbi School of Engineering in addition to loans she took out to pay for school. After starting her job in Nigeria, she’ll be able to pay off her loans within a year. 
A member of the National Society of Black Engineers, Kaba said she said she loves Viterbi and its faculty. But she said being a transfer student was a “rollercoaster” due to a lack of resources for students like her. 
Kaba said the recent college admissions scandal disappointed her because she knows there are other students like her who weren’t accepted to USC. 
“I grew up in a very corrupted country,” Kaba said, referring to her experience living in Guinea. “Coming to the U.S., [I thought I would] avoid this type of mentality. And being at the school where this kind of scandal happens, it saddens me.”

Wanda Austin doesn’t like to sleep in. Every morning by 7:15 a.m. at the latest, USC’s interim president is at her desk in Bovard Auditorium conducting meetings or reading papers. Dennis Cornell, her chief of staff, has received texts from her as early as 3:12 in the morning. 
“She is definitely a morning person,” Cornell said. “I don’t think she requires a lot of sleep.”
That’s probably for the best, considering the firestorm that Austin stepped into when she assumed the interim presidency. As she prepares to pass on her title to President-elect Carol Folt on July 1, Austin firmly believes the University has corrected course under her leadership — demonstrating “concern and compassion” to counteract two years’ worth of scandals and cover-ups. And she’s proud of her decision to take the reins at a time of turmoil, despite the controversies that have erupted during her tenure.
“I see people excited about the opportunities that they get because they’re at the University of Southern California,” Austin said. “I feel really rewarded that my efforts to ensure the University continues in a positive way enables them to focus on doing the great things they want to do.”
But 12 days after the Daily Trojan sat down with Austin for an extensive interview about her time as interim president thus far, news of USC’s involvement in a nationwide college admissions scandal broke, adding to the lexicon of controversies that have roiled the University in the past two years. Eight days later, Folt was announced as the 12th president in USC’s history, ensuring that Austin — who had no interest in the permanent position — has an end date to her brief but hectic term. 
Under her leadership, Austin has not hesitated to make important decisions, from a $215 million settlement with the victims of former health center gynecologist George Tyndall to the ouster of Marshall School of Business Dean James Ellis. Hours after the news of the admissions scandal broke, she swiftly fired a senior associate athletic director and a highly-decorated water polo coach, both of whom were indicted in the case. 
“In her own sort of quiet, soft way, she’s a disruptor,” Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said. “She has a very clear-eyed view of what needs to be done, and she’s accomplished it.”
Becoming president
Austin, 64, was born in the Bronx, a “barber’s daughter” who displayed an affinity for math early on. She remembers a pivotal moment in junior high school when a teacher encouraged her to pursue her passion despite what others may think.
“Usually girls are told, if you’re too smart, boys won’t be interested,” Austin said. “That wasn’t an issue for me.” 
Austin carried that message with her through college — she received a doctorate in systems engineering from USC in 1988 — and into her career as an engineer and eventually CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, a major national security contractor. She joined USC’s Board of Trustees in 2010 and became the first woman and first person of color to lead the University last May, following former president C. L. Max Nikias’ resignation — an event she said inspired a “roller coaster” of emotions.
“The foundational emotion was just pride and honor, and then the secondary reality is, this is a really big job,” Austin said, laughing. “This is a very big job.”
As a former CEO, Austin is used to putting out fires. She felt her focus on ethical leadership was what USC needed at that time, after a Los Angeles Times investigation first reported accusations that a campus gynecologist had abused students for decades. Coupled with Nikias’ refusal to speak to the Times during its investigation and USC’s intent focus on fundraising under his leadership, there was a sense that the University needed to recalibrate its values. 
“We were in a state of change, and we did not have a succession candidate for the presidency at the time when we decided that we needed to make a change,” Austin said. “I felt that I could offer to serve in that capacity.”
It’s still unclear how much Nikias knew about former Keck School of Medicine Dean Carmen Puliafito’s alleged drug use on campus or Tyndall’s alleged decades-long sexual abuse of students. But repeated scandals, from an FBI sting operation that charged former USC assistant basketball coach Tony Bland with bribery to revelations that Puliafito’s replacement had previously faced accusations of sexual harassment have tested the University’s commitment to transparency. 
Austin has worked to change this trajectory. In one of her first moves as president, she created the Office of Professionalism and Ethics to streamline complaint monitoring and investigation. She followed up by establishing the President’s Campus Culture Commission, a group of administrative, faculty and student leaders working to “raise awareness of our collective values.”
“I think it’s really important that everybody in our community recognizes that if there is an issue they’re concerned about in our community, we want to hear about it,” Austin said. “We want to investigate and follow up.”
Her other major initiative, the USC Office of the Ombuds, was created to offer students a centralized place to go if they wanted to report an issue with a faculty or staff member — a direct response to revelations that students’ and nurses’ numerous reports of Tyndall’s allegedly inappropriate behavior were buried in the chain of command. But more than providing a practical resource, the office aims to send a message that USC is open and willing to listen. 
“People are coming through a number of crises that have shaken their confidence in the school, left them uncertain about the future,” said Thomas Kosakowski, USC’s ombudsman for the Health Sciences Campus. “One of our big jobs is to help empower people by explaining their options by coaching them to be effective advocates for themselves so that these issues don’t stay stuck in a corner — they can be brought out into the light.”
Transparency & accountability
Austin’s commitment to transparency was tested in December, when she made the decision to end Ellis’ term starting in June 2019. A number of complaints against the school were received by the USC Office of Equity and Diversity, Austin wrote in a letter at the time, that led her to believe a change of leadership was necessary. But she has never publicly explained what those complaints were and declined to do so in an interview. 
The decision drew criticism from numerous trustees as well as faculty, alumni and students. Hundreds of Ellis’ supporters protested on campus and donors threatened to withdraw their contributions, while critics claimed that Austin shouldn’t have the authority to make drastic employment decisions in her interim position. 
But for Austin, there was never any question about what she had to do. Cornell explained that she saw part of her role as clearing the way for the next president of USC by dealing with the major issues on the table to ensure a smooth path forward. 
“It’s not a holding-place presidency,” Cornell said. “It’s very active.”
Austin said that some misinterpreted the title of “interim” president to imply a more limited role. In her view, she is very much a legitimate leader. 
“I am the president until the new, permanent president shows up,“ Austin said. “I think [future presidents] would look with dismay if they had a president who sat and did not move the ball forward on issues that needed to be addressed.” 
Austin said she consulted with advisors before making the decision to oust Ellis as dean, but that ultimately, it was hers to make alone.  
“Personnel decisions [are] not done by popular vote,” Austin said. “This is not something that you bring out and solicit input from people publicly.”
Caruso led the Board of Trustees’ move to support Austin’s decision and said he saw Ellis’ ouster as an example of her willingness to put the University’s interests above her own. 
“She made a decision and she was personally attacked for it. She knew that was coming, but she also knew she was doing the right thing,” Caruso said. “It’s a very rare quality in the world today to take the right position for all the right reasons, and make the decision knowing that you’ll be criticized for it.”
Austin took a similarly firm stance earlier this month after federal investigators charged a senior USC athletics administrator and four current or former coaches with accepting millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for admitting dozens of students under the guise of athletic recruitment. She announced that USC would deny admission to incoming freshman students who were connected to the scheme, hire an outside law firm to conduct a full review of the scandal and consider revoking the degrees of students who were admitted through fraudulent means. 
Caruso said that before Austin’s tenure, there was “very little accountability” for the actions of USC employees. But her decision to fire senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic sent a strong message that the culture at USC had changed — from one of passivity to one of “transparency and accountability.”
“They were immediately terminated because we had concrete evidence that they violated our trust and abused the admissions process, which undermines our academic integrity,” Austin said in an interview with the Daily Trojan last week. “I was disappointed to find that part of our senior leadership and people we put in positions of trust made unfortunate decisions to serve themselves.”
Dealing with the fallout of the scandal, which has made national headlines, is the latest test that her administration has faced. And Caruso is glad that Austin is the one pushing the buttons.  
“There was quick and decisive action on her part to terminate people who were involved,” Caruso said. “I believe that had Wanda not been there, and there hadn’t been a change in that type of culture … it would have been swept under the rug. Those days are gone.” 
But her intentions were questioned again when Austin sent an email to the USC community describing the University as a “victim” in the scheme, sparking outrage over what many saw as a further denial of responsibility by the administration. Austin said the phrasing was meant to clarify that in legal terms, USC had been defrauded. 
When asked if University leadership should have been aware of the illicit scheme, Austin said she seeks to trust employees, but must verify that their actions are appropriate — and that did not happen. 
“We are accountable for the actions of our employees,” Austin said. “Clearly, we did not detect that something was not being handled properly. We will work to make the corrections that are necessary to make sure that will never happen again.”
Passing on the torch
Last October, USC took its first step in addressing Tyndall, the former Engemann Student Health Center gynecologist who allegedly sexually abused patients over the course of nearly 30 years, by announcing a $215 million settlement with his former patients. 
Though critics called it premature and some former patients told the Daily Trojan they would not participate in the settlement, Austin claimed the payout will provide closure to Tyndall’s victims. 
“It gives people an opportunity to be validated and to be able to say, ‘OK, I was harmed,’ and do that with privacy and respect, without having to relive the specifics or details, or to have to publicly discuss it,” Austin said. 
The settlement was one of Austin’s first major decisions as president in an attempt to mend USC’s culture. But in February, USC was hit with another lawsuit — this time from six former students, all gay or bisexual men, who alleged that men’s health doctor Dennis Kelly sexually abused them during their time at USC. The total number of plaintiffs grew to 21 in March, but USC has not released a statement addressing Kelly, who resigned from the University in August 2018.
Austin’s commitment to openness has been championed, though, by those who have worked with her. Austin’s supporters say she’s ushered in a new era of collaboration and is more willing to listen to the advice of those around her than previous presidents.
“She takes in all the input and makes a decision based on the facts,” Caruso said. “She knows she doesn’t have all the answers, but she knows where to find them.” 
Cornell described Austin’s first cabinet meeting as emblematic of the radical shift that had taken place at the management level. She instructed her senior officers to come prepared with problems that the leadership should discuss as a unit — but also, Cornell said, to propose three solutions for every problem. This “shared governance” approach is important to Austin, who said she has made it a priority since she stepped into this role to “listen first.” 
“One of the nice things about being in an academic community is that you have different voices that can be heard,” Austin said. “I’ve always been one that felt that you can disagree without being disagreeable.”
As Austin prepares to leave office — she is working out a presidential transition before reclaiming her place on the Board of Trustees — she feels the steps taken under her leadership have helped chart a more ethical course for USC’s future. But she has no illusions that the process of change is over. As the recent admissions scandal demonstrated, the lack of accountability that’s built up over decades will have a far-reaching fallout that is difficult to combat. 
“You’d like to be able to hit the ‘easy’ button and declare it done,” Austin said. “This is going to be an effort that goes on for quite some time, long after I’m no longer here.”

USC received a record number of 66,000 freshman applications for its 2019 admission cycle, bringing the admission rate down to 11 percent — the lowest in history. This marks an increase of 2,000 applicants from last year’s application cycle and a 2 percent decrease in admission rate, according to the University.
According to USC News, the University’s admission rate has steadily declined since it was 17.8 percent in 2014. The rate then dropped to 17.5 percent in 2015, 16.5 percent in 2016 and 16 percent in 2017. 
Mary Basilious, a  senior at Village Christian School in Sun Valley, who was recently admitted, said she felt intimidated by the University’s low admission rate and was excited about this year’s record rates.
“USC seems to be a very diverse school,” Basilious said. “It’s much more diverse than a lot of elite universities, so I’d feel a lot more comfortable going there.” 
The University earned the 22nd spot on the U.S. News and World Report Best College Rankings for 2019, tied with Georgetown University and UC Berkeley. 
The incoming Class of 2023 is the most diverse admitted class in USC history, with underrepresented minority students making up 29.5 percent and first-generation students making up 15 percent of the admission pool — a jump from last year’s respective 26 and 14.28 percent.
USC said 36 percent of admitted applicants hailed from California, 3 percent drop from last year.
Simmone Stearn, a senior at San Dieguito High School Academy in Encinitas said she was happy to be admitted and is hopeful that the University will do more to increase diversity and ensure its student population reflects the demographics within California.
“I think it’s great [the University] … is trying to find students of different backgrounds,” Stearn said. “That definitely would make me want to go there more, if they’re continually striving to make it a more diverse place.”
The University has yet to release statistics on admitted applicants concerning grade point averages and SAT and ACT scores. Detailed breakdowns of the admitted class based on race, gender and geographic location have also not been released.

Both the men’s and women’s golf teams look to continue their stellar seasons this weekend at the Goodwin Tournament hosted by Stanford and the ASU Invite, respectively. 
The women’s team is currently on a roll. The Trojans dominated the competition at the Clover Cup two weeks ago, winning the tournament by a combined 16 strokes. This performance solidified the Trojans’ position above Texas as the No. 1 team nationally. Although the competition was not as strong as it was at other tournaments, the win was still a confidence booster for the team, as it was its first win of the spring season.
The team played a complete and consistent tournament. Freshman Malia Nam and sophomores Jennifer Chang and Amelia Garvey finished in the top 10 individually. Chang did not shoot above par on any day, finishing the weekend at two under par and tying for first place.  
The team will face much stronger opponents at the ASU Invite, many of whom are just behind USC in the rankings. Many of these teams are from the Pac-12 as well, so the event will be a solid preview of the upcoming Pac-12 tournament and could be indicative of possible outcomes further into the postseason as well. UCLA, Stanford, Arizona, Arizona State and Furman are among the nation’s top 25 teams present at the tournament, comprising a highly competitive field. 
While the women were winning the Clover Cup, the men placed second at the National Invitational Tournament. Led by senior Justin Suh, who was one stroke short of a first-place finish, USC edged out Oklahoma for the second place, although it finished well behind the leader, Arizona State.  
Similar to the women’s competition at the Clover Cup, the men played against an overall weaker field with the exception of Arizona State and Oklahoma. However, the tournament was a strong recovery from the team’s struggles at its previous tournament, the Southern Highlands Collegiate, in which it placed 10th.  
Although its poor performance caused them to drop three spots in the rankings and looked like a cause for concern, it is important to note that the team was missing Suh, who was preparing for the Arnold Palmer Invitational. With Suh’s return last weekend, the team got back on track quickly to reclaim the No. 6 spot in the nation.  
This weekend, the men will face a field which includes Oklahoma as well as other ranked opponents in Cal and Pepperdine. Oklahoma won the tournament last season, and USC had a rough outing, finishing near the bottom of the pack. This year, however, USC will put forth a stronger overall team and will look to continue its performance from the NIT.  
As the regular season winds down, both the men’s and women’s teams hope to sharpen their play and begin to peak with the postseason looming. While the women are in a comfortable position, this weekend will be a real test in a highly competitive field. For the men, this tournament will be essential in preparing for postseason play.

The USC men’s volleyball team remains at home this week to host two conference matches against No. 6 Stanford and No. 10 Brigham Young at Galen Center.
USC (13-8, 4-4 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) moved up from No. 11 to No. 9 this week after beating top-ranked and defending NCAA champion Long Beach State in a major upset Saturday night. This marks USC’s highest ranking since the 2015 season. 
Senior outside hitter Jack Wyett was named the American Volleyball Coaches Association National Player of the Week after an impressive showing against Long Beach State, hitting .579 to put up 13 kills, four digs, an ace and a block. 
Wyett was also named the MPSF Offensive Player of the Week and senior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso was named the MPSF Defensive Player of the Week. 
USC is 65-34 in the series against Stanford (14-8, 5-4 MPSF) but lost its last meeting in February 3-2. Sophomore opposite hitter Jaylen Jasper and senior outside hitter Jordan Ewert lead the Cardinal with 292 and 281 kills, respectively. Jasper has also served 18 aces this season. Defensively, redshirt senior libero Kyle Dagostino and junior middle blocker Stephen Moye lead with 159 digs and 70 blocks, respectively.
The Trojans lead 43-23 in their series against BYU (12-8, 6-3 MPSF) as well but lost 3-1 in their last matchup in February. Sophomore opposite hitter Gabi Garcia Fernande stands out on offense with 305 kills and 27 service aces in the books. He also leads the defense with 105 digs. Freshman outside hitter Davide Gardini has added 98 digs.
The Trojans are undefeated at home this season. Wyett and fellow senior outside hitter Ryan Moss lead the team in kills with 263 and 244, respectively. Grasso is a force on the end line with 17 service aces  this season so far. Moss and sophomore middle blocker Sam Lewis have 42 and 44 blocks, respectively, and senior libero Matt Douglas leads with 116 digs. 
Against such elite competition, Wyett said the Trojans will focus on efficiency in their two matches this weekend. 
“Serving and passing is definitely a key element to our success, so if we can accomplish that throughout the match, I think we’ll be OK,” Wyett said. 
Looking at how the Trojans have grown this season, Wyett said the team is stronger, more cohesive and having a lot more fun. 
“When you get wins like this it definitely makes you stronger, and it makes you appreciate everyone else on the court that much more, knowing that they want you to win just as much as you want yourself to win,” Wyett said. 
Although the Trojans have made huge strides this season and the win last weekend was “a great milestone,” Wyett said their end goal is to win a national championship. 
The Trojans are back on their usual home court at Galen Center after playing two weeks in the North Gym due to scheduling conflicts. The Stanford game is set for 7 p.m. Friday and the Brigham Young game 7 p.m. Saturday. Both matches will be broadcasted on Pac-12 Networks.

This week, the American Civil Liberties Union published an article detailing why it is both illegal and immoral to ban trans girls from school sports. When I saw the headline, I was shocked to find out that banning young girls was even a consideration.
In reality, I shouldn’t have been surprised. This debate is at the forefront of many intersectional discussions of gender and sport. Martina Navratilova — an LGBTQ+ icon in sports — even took time earlier this year to speak out against transgender athletes competing against cisgender athletes, citing the “unfairness” of the situation.
Due to the perception of the type of body that is “best” at sports, most people who make this an issue center the discussion on trans women who compete in female sports divisions. Thus, the debate mainly targets trans women, easily one of the most persecuted and discriminated groups out of our entire population.
The fact that only trans women are targeted by this debate is only one of the biggest holes in its logic. There are a lot of parts of this discussion that frustrate me and confuse me and just make me want to cry. The main issue, however, is the concept of denying children’s access to sport.
Most people grew up playing sports. Some loved it, some hated it. Some got picked last in gym, some went on to become varsity captains. For a lot of people, sports were just a way to kill time when they were young — pick-up games at recess, recreational teams in elementary school, cross country in high school to stay in shape. But many of us loved sports when we were younger, which is why we love them so much today and why sport remains one of the most powerful industries in the world.
I remember what it was like to be little and just love sports. I wasn’t the greatest athlete as a kid — my dad still swears I didn’t learn how to run properly until middle school — but I was strong and stubborn enough to keep up with most of the girls and even some of the guys in my class. There was nothing better than kickball at recess or dodgeball day in gym class. 
When it comes to the debate of how to classify trans athletes, I wish this was the focus of more conversations. Stop worrying about who wins the high school track meet. Focus more on who gets to play ball.
I played junior varsity basketball in high school. I played JV because I was 5-foot-10 on a good day and played post against girls who towered over me by three or four inches. Most games, I just did my best to front the girl I was defending and keep her from getting the ball. I fouled out. A lot. I did my best to compensate with speed and skill, but I wasn’t quick enough, and my hook shot wasn’t reliable enough to balance out my size.
It wasn’t those tall girls’ fault that I didn’t make varsity. It wasn’t my fault, either. They were born into their bodies, and I was born into mine, and that was OK. I played JV for two years, made friends who I never would’ve talked to without basketball, and my parents got to come to every single game. I had fun. 
The trans girls who this debate focuses on can’t help it either. They were born into their bodies, and that’s not their fault. They just want to play. Maybe they just want to be part of a team, a strong group of girls who they can confide in and rely on. Maybe they do want to compete at a higher level. Maybe they just love to play, the way that many of us have loved to play sports our whole lives.
Honestly, who are we to tell a kid they can’t play at the elementary, middle or high school level? Who are we to take one of the greatest parts of being kid away from someone just because of the body they were born into? 
Regulating trans bodies without regulating all other bodies is discriminatory, period. That part of this argument is rather simple. But the more complex issue is the moral side of it — the fact that we, as a society, are even discussing keeping a kid out of sports.
This conversation is only getting started, and I guarantee that over the coming years it will be brought into legislative and legal battles. But as we continue to move forward in this discussion, I hope we can focus on the humanity, not the trophies, that are connected to it. Think of the kids first, the kids who just want to play ball. At the end of the day, they’re what matters most.
Julia Poe is a senior writing about her personal connection to sports. Her column, “Poe’s Perspective,” runs weekly on Thursdays.

Nestled among bossam restaurants, spa houses and all you can eat barbeque joints, Los Angeles’ Koreatown has a variety of cafés suited to your needs — especially if you plan on staying up all night to study. Here’s a short list of coffee shops for your next venture north into Koreatown.Alchemist Coffee Project
698 S Vermont Ave.
Los Angeles, CA 90005
Hours: Monday to Saturday: 7:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Sunday: 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. 
The Grind: On Alchemist’s rotation is beans from coffee producers Intelligentsia and Heart. Alchemist also offers an extensive menu, including variations on matcha lattes, such as the lavender matcha latte and the matcha americano. 
The Cream: The menu boasts a wide assortment of toast, from a classic strawberry ricotta to a new Korean cuisine-inspired kimchi avocado. 
The Roast: Part of Alchemist’s charm is its industrial design. The wall behind the coffee counter is fitted with dark gray brick, and bare, elongated light bulbs hang in clusters from the ceiling. But this design also lends to poor lighting inside. Bring an already lit screen or prepare for slight eye strain at this cafe. 
Sharp Specialty Coffee
3421 W 6th St.
Los Angeles, CA 90020
Hours: 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. daily
The Grind: Sharp brews Sightglass and Coava beans, and its lattes hit the sweet spot between too strong and too creamy.
The Cream: High ceilings, white walls and hanging plants lend Sharp a modern, Pinterest-esque vibe. 
The Roast: One of the failings of the interior design of Sharp is the south-facing ceiling-to-floor windows. From early afternoon to sunset, sunbeams flood the room, and anyone sitting at the window’s bar will suffer from both hot glares and elevated temperatures.
Nothing But Coffee
3952 Wilshire Blvd.
Los Angeles, CA 90010
Hours: 9 a.m. to 2 a.m. daily
The Grind: Nothing But Coffee doesn’t have the strongest brews, but it does offer a wide selection of beverages. From a truffle honey latte to its titular NBC latte, Nothing But Coffee delivers more than just what its name promises. Teas, lemonade and Arnold Palmers also make an appearance.
The Cream: This is the spot for a late night grind. Most cafes have early closing hours, as caffeine can greatly affect one’s sleep, but Nothing But Coffee will serve you espresso until 2 a.m.
The Roast: Though the cafe’s light wood furnishings give it an open, empty feeling, its backless benches can get very uncomfortable after a few hours. The table and chair height ratios aren’t the best for posture either, and regulars can be seen hunched over laptops, using the wickedly fast Wi-Fi.

Mato Standing Soldier remembers the first time he asked someone to make music with him. He was 16, living in his hometown of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. He called one of his good friends and popped the question, and less than an hour later, the two had pieced together some hip-hop demos using a microphone from the Rock Band video game.
Since then, Standing Soldier, who creates music under the moniker Mato Wayuhi, has come a long way in building his repertoire. He’s recorded and released two full-length projects — “Pretty Pink Tapes” in 2017 and “Part-Time Indian” in 2018 — and held a slew of live performances. He’s made appearances at L.A.’s inaugural Indigenous Peoples Day Celebration and the conference for the National Congress of American Indians. 
Wayuhi, now a junior majoring in cinema and media studies, arrived at USC in August 2016. But he said his infatuation with Los Angeles started long before then. 
“I’ve always been really attached to different aspects of L.A., whether it be like the skateboarding scene or the music scene,” Wayuhi said. “So, in college, I had to come around — I kind of made it my prerogative to get out to the West Coast.”
After spending the first 18 years of his life in South Dakota, Wayuhi said the biggest difference between L.A. and his home state is the city’s vast amount of cultural diversity.
“That’s why I always tell people I’m studying abroad in Los Angeles,” Wayuhi said. “The cultural discrepancies are huge, and it’s really fun being able to learn about different things and teach people as well … There are different narratives to tell from that gained experience from different experiences and ancestors.”
Wayuhi, a member of the Lakota tribe, said he sees himself as an “agent of storytelling” for his ancestors, who did not have the opportunity to share their stories or experiences with the world. But telling such stories is no solo effort. Wayuhi said that social media is indispensable for native creatives who want to platform their work or collaborate with others.
“I feel like [natives] have really reclaimed our narratives on social medias,” Wayuhi said. “There’s so much incredible and meaningful art that you can just find on social media from native artists.”
Wayuhi also spends a lot of his time in Downtown Los Angeles. As a member of USC Share A Meal, he spends every Monday night rolling burritos and preparing hot meals for the homeless on Skid Row through L.A.-based nonprofit Khalsa Peace Corps. Most nights, Wayuhi is in charge of making the rice, beans and other components, which other volunteers then roll into the burritos. 
This semester, Wayuhi’s priorities have mostly lined with completing his new project “Scatterbrain,” an album that features instrumentation from his live performance band Treehorse. 
“I’m taking you through an anxiety attack in the most literal sense,” Wayuhi said. “Growing up, I had a lot of insecurities in the classroom in terms of my intelligence level and how I was able to pay attention and how I would have to stifle my creativity. So, it’s going through a lot of those different emotions and experiences.”
For his previous works, Wayuhi recorded and produced most of the material by himself in South Dakota. With “Scatterbrain,” the rapper saw an opportunity to incorporate the rest of the band into his production. Thus, Wayuhi abandoned his prior spring break plans of hiking in Northern California to focus on finishing the album.
“I’ve had time to be in L.A. and work with a lot of [the band] — like learn[ing] about one another from a creative standpoint — so it’s been fun to get them on and put their sauce on everything,” Wayuhi said with a laugh. “It’s all about the sauce.”
Wayuhi’s “Scatterbrain” is set for an early summer release. He is also expected to announce tour dates and locations throughout the West Coast.
