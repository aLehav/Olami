For as long as he can remember, USC alumnus Craig Hammill has been in love with watching films on the silver screen. 
A fourth generation Angeleno, Hammill grew up with the dream of seeing his own name up in the credits of a major blockbuster film. Thus, at an early age, he decided to listen to his heart and pursue film.
“Think of it as voices in your heart,” Hammill said. “I don’t think anyone regrets going for it. I think people regret not listening [to their heart].”
Hammill started applying to film schools when he was 17. He narrowed his search down to three universities: UCLA, USC and NYU. And, in the end, a hometown affinity and favorable financial aid package led him to University Park.
After arriving at USC, Hammill founded his own student organization called Screenings, which organized classic film screenings in theaters on campus and invite creatives who worked on the films to speak about their experiences. This club was the brainchild for his current venture at Vista Theatre — Secret Movie Club. There, he channels his passion for 35-millimeter film by hosting screenings almost every weekend for strangers and friends alike. 
Ironically, Hammill developed his interest in 35-millimeter film in the midst of the film industry’s pivot to digital photography in the early 2000s. After completing his undergraduate education, Hammill decided to return to USC to pursue his master’s degree in the School of Cinematic Arts. While more students in his program chose to shoot on digital, Hammill doubled down on 35-millimeter film. He loved the organic, constrained nature of shooting on film, and felt that the pressure of perfecting finite shots forces the entire cast and crew to step up their game.
“You have to storyboard the shots — you have to think about where you’re going to put the camera,” Hammill said. “You have to think about how you added it and so you do so much in your head that I think the movie that comes out is more planned and there’s more vision, because you can’t say, ‘Well, let’s just shoot whatever and see what happens.’”
As a graduate student, Hammill completed his masterpiece, a short film called “The Cleats of Imminent Doom,” a comedy that satirizes the serious, competitive nature of youth sports, which is particularly emphasized by overzealous parents.
“It’s about soccer parents and soccer kids — it was like American suburbia through the filter of youth sports,” Hammill said. 
During his time at USC, he emphasized the plethora of resources that the school provided, including an internship with director Martin Scorsese during his undergraduate years. 
“The dean of the film school was always accessible. You can always go into her office,” Hammill said. “Everybody took meetings with me — there was no B.S. I mean, USC, they give you every opportunity.”
However, after garnering initial success from screening  “The Cleats of Imminent Doom” at film festivals, Hammill had trouble finding opportunities to direct a feature-length film, which he attributes to his own youthful arrogance and hubris. Since college, he’s directed small commercials, shorts and webisodes for various companies and creatives. Still, he said his passion for 35-millimeter film pressed on, and, after the birth of his son, he decided to take a risk in pursuit of his passions. When he founded Screenings, he believed a similar concept could work with Los Angeles’ burgeoning population of film aficionados.
He then made a few phone calls with friends at Vista Theatre and rented the space out for a screening of “Raiders of the Lost Ark.” He invited close friends, loved ones and former classmates to join what would become the Secret Movie Club. 
At first, the club only met once a month and was advertised by word of mouth. Then, one night, he hosted a particularly unsuccessful screening of Al Pacino’s “Scarface” —  only 30 people showed up, and he lost $600. 
Hammill said this early failure forced him to find new ways to expand his audience outreach. He started using Facebook to promote the Secret Movie Club, and almost all of his advertising is still dedicated to the social media giant. 
The next month, he hosted a screening of Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange.” Hammill sold out the entire theater. And the triumph of that screening meant that Secret Movie Club was there to stay. 
Since then, Secret Movie Club has expanded into something much greater than a film screening reserved for friends. In fact, it’s developed into its own community. Cosplay and inside jokes are now the norm from week to week. Regulars attendees and newcomers mingle in the lobby and chat about their favorite flicks before and after every screening. Hammill peddles custom made, limited edition (and Secret Movie Club-approved) posters as attendees leave the theater. 
“Everybody who’s part of Secret Movie Club is approachable,” Hammill said. “Everybody’s invited. If you come, we’re glad you’re there.”
Even with the club’s continued growth, Hammill sees Secret Movie Club as a uniquely local phenomenon. And while expansion to other locations is not out of the question, Hammill said he must be careful not to bite off more than he can chew. 
“If you try to be president of the United States, or you try to make a $50 million movie, or you try to suddenly have Secret Movie Club in 20 cities, it will fall apart,” Hammill said.
If anything, he sees internal growth for Secret Movie Club, potentially through greater social media engagement, podcasts or other events. Still, Hammill insisted that the club’s existence and potential expansion comes from a place of passion, not greed. In fact, he said that almost all of their revenue goes toward funding their next screening. 
“It’s really important that it always comes out of a real love and passion for what we’re showing and doing — movies that people are excited to go and see,” Hammill said. “I think if you start to do stuff just to make money, or you do stuff just to be successful, I think everybody smells that and they’re like, ‘Oh, this isn’t cool anymore.’”

After a second attempt at strike negotiation son Wednesday, the Los Angeles Unified School District and its teachers are at an impasse yet again — they have decided to continue discussion on Friday and postpone the strike to Monday. 
If the strike occurs, it will undoubtedly have many negative effects for the Los Angeles community, especially with regard to student safety. Not only that, but it may also affect students’ future plans and paths to higher education or vocational school.
Teachers are demanding smaller class sizes, school nurses and higher wages. These goals would be realistic if LAUSD had the funding — but it doesn’t. With its projected $408 million shortfall, declining enrollment and unwillingness to increase taxes, LAUSD would be unable to afford these changes. 
A tax hike would effectively  increase funding and meet teachers’ demands, but the area LAUSD serves is primarily low-income — a tax increase may be beyond their means of living. The Los Angeles Times reported that 80 percent of LAUSD students receive free or reduced-price lunches. It would be hard on the community to raise taxes, but without additional federal funding, there is no way for LAUSD to obtain funding and avoid a strike. Because of the sheer lack of money, the teachers’ demands quickly become unfeasible.
Student safety is the most direct consequence from a strike. Many students who attend LAUSD schools are unable to stay at home during a strike — most parents in the area work during the day and will have to send their children to school, despite the insufficient number of teachers to oversee them — let alone educate them. School police will also not be reporting truant students, and, with such a low teacher-to-student ratio, the likelihood of truancy will likely only increase. Students not receiving the usual amount of attention or education might decide to leave school, and the few substitutes would be unable to keep track of attendance. 
Furthermore, parents who work as teachers or school staff will be in a double bind. During the strike, they won’t have an  income to support their families. All of the immediate consequences of the strike endanger students and waste precious educational time.
In addition to these short-term effects, some students will have their futures negatively impacted by the lack of teachers, librarians, nurses and counselors at their schools. Jan. 15 is the general application deadline to apply to USC, and many students may miss the opportunity for guidance from counselors and teachers before they submit applications to USC and other higher education institutions. They also will not have counselors and other support staff with whom to plan as they make final decisions for their futures. 
While LAUSD has hired roughly 400 substitutes, their plans only cover 8 percent of the number of usual teachers and staff, according to the Los Angeles Times. This is nowhere near enough support for students who are a few months from graduating and for the rest of the 640,000 students enrolled in L.A. public schools, as reported by the LAUSD website.
If the strike endures for a significant portion of the academic year, universities like USC will also be negatively affected. USC’s student body comprises many students from local high schools, all of which will be short-staffed during a strike. According to USC’s profile of the class of 2022, students from Foshay Learning Center, a nearby LAUSD K-12 school, comprise the second highest number of students from a single public high school. Students who aren’t receiving a complete education will struggle to keep up with their peers unaffected by a strike. 
There is no room for compromise — the strike will happen and hurt many students’ education, simply because there isn’t enough funding. LAUSD started this academic year with a projected $7.3 billion in revenue, according to their annual budget report, but even this does not seem to be enough. To increase teacher pay, the money must come from an equal opposite action — increasing class size proportionally. To hire school nurses means cutting salaries for already comparatively low paid teachers. 
The best teachers can do is to put their students first — for some, that may be continuing to strike, but accepting a smaller negotiation tradeoff or crossing the picket line is not a sign of defeat. Instead, it’s  an acceptance that students and their futures need help right now. The fiscal depletion LAUSD faces cannot be solved with fulfillment of demands in a single day, but only through small steps over time.

As the U.S. government enters its third week of shutdown, federal workers and agencies are facing the reverberations of unpaid work, furloughed employees and funding slashes. But among the institutions affected by the shutdown, those in charge of distributing funding for research and higher education are unable to support universities like USC. 
Nearly 800,000 federal employees cannot work with pay during the shutdown. Groups like the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities and NASA are unable to operate without a staff. Because these agencies are responsible for disbursing federal grants to research universities, the government shutdown throws major projects into jeopardy.
In 2018, the NSF allocated more grants to California than to any other state, and USC has been a frequent beneficiary of those allocated grants. In 2017, a record 24 members of USC’s graduating class received NSF’s prestigious Graduate Research Fellowship. 
The Viterbi School of Engineering’s NSF Research Traineeship program alone disperses approximately $36,100,000 through grants for graduate student researchers. But applications for these grants cannot be processed and, because of the shutdown, money has yet to be distributed. 
In addition to the NSF, USC students and researchers also receive funding from the NEH, which funds summer stipends of up to $6,000 for any faculty member pursuing research in the humanities. It also funds challenge grants of up to $750,000 for universities to develop greater infrastructure in their humanities curriculum. However, NEH has also experienced severe shutdown consequences. As a result, students and researchers who could have benefitted from hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding for their projects can no longer do so.
Beyond research, a federal shutdown means that the Department of Education cannot provide essential oversight and support for universities. For example, the Education Department is unable to continue its investigations into university civil rights cases during the shutdown. Catherine Lhamon, the department’s former assistant secretary for civil rights, reported to Inside Higher Ed that during the 16-day shutdown of the Obama administration, the Office of Civil Rights could not conduct their investigations nor reclaim any money and time that was lost during that time period.
In a memo about the government shutdown, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos warned that programs supporting disadvantaged students rely heavily on government funding. With 90 percent of the department’s workforce on unpaid leave, federal support for low-ncome students is stalled. 
The money that students in need rely on — Pell grants, direct student loans — have been disbursed and allocated for some time to come, but if the shutdown persists, edits to or requests for additional funding may become unavailable if there are not enough employees to process these changes.  Students will be unable to procure the assistance they need to continue attending school, affecting their future plans and university enrollment.
President Donald Trump’s perspective on the federal shutdown is narrow-minded. It focuses only on the partisan divide and neglects the government’s broad range of responsibilities. When speaking of those affected directly by the shutdown, Trump focused heavily on their political affiliations rather than the effect their jobs have on society. 
He has failed to demonstrate a basic understanding not only of workers whose daily lives have been disrupted, but also of the magnitude of its consequences.
Trump’s actions have a much greater reach than he realizes. Getting the government running again is not just a matter of partisan divide over a border wall; it is a matter of success or failure for researchers and agencies alike.

Failure can be beneficial in sports. It serves as a great motivator and brings greater attention to areas that need improvement. But it’s hard to come away from the USC men’s basketball team’s 79-74 overtime loss at Oregon State Thursday without focusing on just how close the Trojans were to winning.
The game was decided by a matter of inches — that’s how close freshman guard Kevin Porter was to making what would have been a game-tying layup in the extra frame. Porter, playing in his first game since he sustained a thigh bruise, couldn’t find the energy to get all the way to the rim, instead opting for a finger roll. 
Beavers junior forward Kylor Kelley extended his 7-foot frame and rose up for his seventh block of the night. Oregon State made a few free throws to seal the victory, and the Trojans had to deal with a stinging defeat.
The loss was all the more frustrating because it wasted an incredible performance from senior forward Bennie Boatwright. Boatwright stepped up time and time again for the Trojans, pouring in a career-high 37 points on 14-of-24 shooting and 4-of-9 from three, also adding eight rebounds.
Beavers senior guard Stephen Thompson matched Boatwright shot for shot, however, tallying a career-high 34 points, 10 rebounds and five assists. No matter who USC defended him with, Thompson got what he wanted — shooting 11-of-19 from the field.
Although their chances to win the game came late, the Trojans will look back at Oregon State’s 18-to-0 run in the first half as the point when they lost this game. The Beavers, down 25-14 at one point, out-worked and out-executed USC during this stretch, building a lead that they would hold for most of regulation.
Boatwright’s heroics brought USC back, and the Trojans even held a 2-point lead in the final minutes of the second half until Beavers sophomore guard Ethan Thompson made a put-back to tie the game at 66. Boatwright missed a shot from the top of the key just before the buzzer, and Oregon State outlasted the Trojans in overtime.
However, the Trojans can’t dwell on this loss. As head coach Andy Enfield finally regains the pieces that had so many USC fans hopeful coming into the season, he’s set to square off against a coach who knows what an injury-derailed season feels like. 
“It’s a blow,” Oregon head coach Dana Altman said. “But hey, it’s college basketball. You have to adjust. Other guys are going to have to step up.”
After being projected to finish first in the Pac-12 preseason rankings, Altman has lost projected lottery pick freshman center Bol Bol to foot surgery, Pac-12 All-Defensive Team member sophomore forward Kenny Wooten to a fractured jaw and sophomore forward Abu Kigab to a transfer to Boise State. 
Before being ruled out for the season, Bol was the focal point for Oregon on both sides of the court, averaging 21 points, 9.6 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game. Since the 7-foot-2 center went down, the Ducks have yet to top 75 points and has lost much of the luster that created so much hype in Eugene and across the nation. 
At 12.4 points per game, junior guard Pritchard Payton is the new leading scorer for the Bol-less Ducks. Payton will be hoping to right the ship, as he’s shot 11-for-39 from the field and 7-for-26 from deep over the last three games. Payton is one of just three upperclassmen on the Ducks’ roster and is the lone healthy player averaging double-digits in scoring. 
With only eight scholarship players and a roster filled with underclassmen, Oregon lacks both the talent and veteran leadership to defeat a USC team growing stronger by the day.
Porter and freshmen guard Elijah Weaver returned to practice this week and finally seem poised to put the Trojans back to full strength. The duo’s return will be just their second on-court stint all season, with a 95-59 routing of Stetson being the lone appearance of the highly touted freshmen guards. In their return, Enfield can look forward to quality production as the two have combined averages of 20.6 points and 5.7 assists, albeit in limited samplings.  
The Trojans are as close to full strength as they have been all season and are riding high off a four-game winning streak, making their matchup against an undermanned Oregon squad seem all but determined. However, as the early season loss to Santa Clara made evident, no away game is an easy victory in college basketball.
USC will attempt to win on the road Sunday at 5 p.m. as they take on the Oregon Ducks in Eugene.

Women’s basketball will look to improve a 0-3 conference record when it hosts Oregon and Oregon State this weekend. The Women of Troy stand at 10-4 overall — they lost four of their last five contests and fell in each of their matchups with Power 5 schools.
USC will have a great challenge on its hands when it goes against No. 5 Oregon at the Galen Center on Friday night. Oregon is 13-1 and winning by an average of 30 points per game. The Ducks have a tremendous amount of offensive firepower, averaging 92.4 points per game to lead the nation.
Junior guard Sabrina Ionescu runs the show for the Ducks, leading the team in scoring with 19.8 points per game and shooting 50.7 percent from three, but her most formidable skill lies in her passing ability. Ionescu’s nine assists per game are top in the nation, proving she is a versatile threat with the ball in her hands. Throw in her 8.1 rebounds per contest, the second greatest record on the team, and it’s clear that Ionescu presents problems for the Trojans on both sides of the court.
The Ducks’ junior forward Ruthy Hebard, last season’s National Power Forward of the Year, is also an early standout of this season. She leads the NCAA in field goal percentage, shooting 70.9 percent from the field. 
“[We need to] push [Hebard] out and make it harder for her to score,” junior forward Kayla Overbeck  said of her upcoming role against Oregon. “She will score, but [I will do] everything I can.”
Things don’t get any easier for the Women of Troy on Sunday when they host Oregon State. The Beavers aren’t quite the offensive juggernaut that the Ducks are; Oregon State’s 81.7 points per game are good for 17th in the nation, but they have a well-rounded attack that has helped them solidify a 12-2 record. 
If USC doesn’t get out to the 3-point line on defense, the Women of Troy could be in for a world of trouble. Oregon State boasts over 25 3-pointers per game and comprises 43.2 percent of them as a team, ranking second in the nation.
Junior guard Mikayla Pivec is a driving force for the Beavers on both ends of the floor. She leads the team with 8.7 rebounds per game as well as 15 steals and eight blocks through 14 games. She also ranks second on the team at 13.9 points per game and shoots almost 54 percent from deep.
USC will have to worry about redshirt sophomore guard Destiny Slocum when the Beavers are playing offense. Her 15.7 points and 5.6 assists per game both lead the team, and her 42.9 percent mark from behind the arc proves she is another threat from deep.
“[We need to] know our personnel, stay with our person, focus on what we worked on in practice and try not to get off of that,” senior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley said. “We’re going to have to help defense a lot, especially with the posts that we’re going against with Oregon. Offense will come, but we need to stop them on defense first.”
While the Trojans’ defense has kept them in games this season, the team has been allocating significant practice time to making adjustments offensively.
“We just need to take good shots,” head coach Mark Trakh said. “We need to run our offense, we need to be patient, we need to have really good shot selection and we need to control the tempo.”
The weekend’s conference action will begin against Oregon at 8 p.m. Friday. The Trojans will then host the Beavers at 12 p.m. on Sunday before facing three consecutive games on the road.

USC seniors forward Leah Pruitt and defender Ally Prisock both became professional athletes on Thursday when they were selected in the National Women’s Soccer League draft.
Pruitt was a first round and fifth overall pick to reigning champions North Carolina Courage as the first true striker taken in the draft. From her time at USC, Pruitt tallied 65 points from 22 goals scored and 21 assists in 63 games played. Pruitt also won a National Championship for the Trojans in 2016. 
Last season, the United Soccer Coaches recognized Pruitt as the Third-Team All-American, and she also received First Team All-Pac-12 honors. She finished the season with 33 points scoring 12 goals and nine assists. 
“I’m so excited for this opportunity,” Pruitt said on the NWSL podium after getting drafted. “I just want to thank my coaches I’ve grown up with, Keidane and Jason at USC [and] my teammates at USC. You guys definitely pushed me to be where I am today, and I’m really excited to start my new journey.”
Last season, the North Carolina Courage led the NWSL with 53 goals. Pruitt will join forces with the likes of Lynn Williams, who finished second in the league, scoring 14 goals throughout the year.
In selecting Pruitt, North Carolina drafted a player who can score for the team, while also consistently pressing defenders high-up on the field. Pruitt is a workhorse forward on-and-off the ball.
Prisock was selected in the second round with the 12th overall pick by the Houston Dash. She played a total of 90 games for the Trojans, starting in every game of her college career — even setting a record last season for most appearances by a Trojan player. During her career, she scored one goal and assisted on three more as a defender.
Prisock was named First-Team All-American by the United Soccer Coaches and received First Team All-Pac-12 honors last season. The Trojans allowed less than one goal per game last season, conceding 11 goals in 22 games with Prisock at the heart of the defense.
“I’m really excited to come to the city and start playing for you guys,” Prisock tweeted.  “I’m really thankful and blessed just to have this opportunity.”
Last year, the Houston Dash finished in fourth place to top off a mixed season. The team conceded a total of 39 goals during the season, the second most out of any team, lending Prisock an opportunity to strengthen the team’s defense and lower that statistic. Prisock will reunite with former Trojan goalkeeper and teammate Sammy Jo Prudhomme. Together they won the National Championship in 2016.

The USC Race and Equity Center is debuting its USC Equity Institutes program, a virtual diversity training course for administrators, faculty and staff from universities across the country, after completing its pilot initiative last semester.
Universities can sign up to take eight-week courses that meet once a week with various instructors in video conferences. According to Jade Agua, associate director for learning and organizational development at the Rossier School of Education, the courses include two weeks of foundational training focused on the basics of racial equity in higher education institutions. 
The remaining six weeks focus on each institution’s specific needs, such as recruiting and retaining more faculty and staff members of color, or focusing on the experiences of students of color in Greek life.
“Our strategy is unique in that we are targeting executive level leadership,” Agua said. “So vice presidents and above, people who can make some big decisions on their campuses, but also with an eye toward sustainability, so building in what they’re learning, so that the work continues far beyond the eight weeks of our program.” 
Stanford University and four other institutions will start their training this month, according to Agua. She said the program will continue to run through the 2019-20 fiscal  year. 
After completing the course, Agua said participating universities will continue to work on projects they created during the course to execute their individual goals. She said the Race and Equity Center will act as a project management team to periodically check in with and guide the universities.
“For the sort of change that these institutions are looking to make, it’s not reasonable to think that in two months it’ll be done,” said Joanna Drivalas, a research associate at the USC Race and Equity Center who served as a teaching assistant for some of the courses. “It takes time for things to sink in, for things to be applied to their setting and then to actually make policy and practice changes on their campus.” 
Kaylan Baxter, a research associate at the USC Race and Equity Center, has seen how the course has impacted its students while working as a teaching assistant for some of the courses. 
“People, especially people from different racial backgrounds, have had really candid conversations that they probably wouldn’t have been able to have in moments of crisis or a regular meeting,” Baxter said. “I think those have been the most transformative exchanges that I’ve watched.” 
Agua said that university administrators don’t often receive training on diversity. The Equity Institutes give participants the opportunity to learn about the language and skills of inclusivity to create a more welcoming space for everyone on their campuses, she said. 
“There aren’t always opportunities for people to dig in and understand and change not only their own mindsets or approaches to how they think about problems …  but also their strategies for how to change them or address them,” Agua said. “We are hoping to meet that need where our leaders don’t find themselves so distanced from students or so distanced from these topics.”

As a spring admit, Cameron du Pont didn’t expect to feel so lonely. A freshman from Maryland, du Pont found that her classmates are predominantly white and that the University’s resources for new students are insufficient. Thursday’s Black and Latinx New Student Symposium hoped to change that. The symposium, which was held in the Tutor Campus Center Ballroom, was filled with students of color trying to find their footing in their first week at USC. 
“Most classrooms don’t look like this room, if you know what I mean,” said Rosalind Conerly, director of the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs. 
The event, organized by CBCSA and El Centro Chicano, had over 30 new students in attendance. The majority of students were newly admitted freshmen, but transfers, new graduate students and one-semester exchange students were also represented. This is the third year the event has been held for new students in the spring semester. 
The symposium highlighted the University’s resources for black and Latinx students. CBCSA and El Centro Chicano introduced their respective cultural centers and spoke about the programs they offer. 
El Centro Chicano director Billy Vela said the event, formerly known as the Latino New Student Symposium, combined black and Latinx communities because “we are stronger together.” 
During a panel discussion with undergraduate and graduate students, new students questioned how to navigate University resources in a way that isn’t overwhelming. 
Students on the panel discussed pre-professional programs, advisement, food pantries and travel opportunities among other things. Jose Richard Aviles, president of the Latino Graduate Student Association, spoke about LGSA’s plan to create a “Dress for Success Closet,” which will provide clothing to students who don’t have the resources to dress for job interviews and professional opportunities. 
Mae Gates, co-executive director of the Black Student Assembly, said it can sometimes be difficult for students of color to find resources and professional advice on campus.
“There’s a lot of opportunities on this campus that are not publicized,” said Gates, a sophomore majoring in global health. “Your first stop should always be CBCSA or El Centro.” 
The panel also discussed the challenges of being a student of color on campus. A few people said they have experienced impostor syndrome — an inability to believe that one’s success is deserved or legitimately achieved. Aviles, a third-year graduate student studying social work and planning, advised the new students to be proud of their lived experiences.
“There are some folks who may know theory, but we live theory, and that is very different,” Aviles said. “I grew up riding the bus here in L.A., and I’m now working for the L.A. Department of Transportation.” 
Chasia Jeffries, the signature events specialist for CBCSA, said she met the majority of her friends at the Fall 2017 Black and Latinx New Student Symposium.
“This event is really important … to meet other black and Latinx students here on campus,” said Jeffries, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture. 
The panelists and faculty members reminded the students in the audience that they belong at USC, even if it might be difficult at times. 
“There’s a lot of people here that want you to succeed,” Vela said. “We belong, but it’s going to be hard — it ain’t going to be easy. There’s going to be challenges, but we have comunidad.”

The Interfraternity Council on Thursday launched Greek recruitment for the spring semester, which has been expanded from one to two weeks. Rush will include a new requirement for prospective members to visit all 18 fraternities during house tours, according to the IFC website.
The change is a departure from policies in past years that gave prospective members the flexibility to choose among the fraternity houses. The visits will occur on Jan. 12 and 13.
Fraternity and Sorority Leadership Development declined to comment and IFC did not respond to multiple requests for comment at the time of publication.
Philip Bliss, a sophomore majoring in economics/mathematics who serves as the rush chair for Phi Delta Theta, said the new structure for house tours has the potential to strengthen the Greek system at USC.
“I think it is going to help rushees see houses that they would not have gone to otherwise, and it will hopefully increase placement at the end of rush,” Bliss said. “I think it will be effective.” 
Bliss said that in past years, prospective members only visiting fraternities that they were more familiar with has posed challenges in effectively coordinating Greek recruitment.
“They don’t really get to meet a lot of people who they might [have] connected with well … so this just really levels the playing field in that way,” Bliss said. 
However, Eli Gruen, a freshman majoring in narrative studies, said that because some prospective members begin recruitment already knowing which houses they want to join, the new house visit policy should not be necessary for every prospective member.
“It makes sense why [IFC] would want people to do that … and [prospective members] should look around,” Gruen said. “But also, I don’t know if I would want to go to every single [house].” 
Decker Paterson, a freshman majoring in theatre and music industry, said the new policy is burdensome because he already knows which fraternity he wants to rush.
“I would have much rather just picked the two frats that I want to rush and do that in a more [time-saving] environment,” Paterson said.  
With Greek recruitment now taking place over the course of two weeks, Bliss said that a longer rush process is beneficial for the prospective members even if it is more work for the frats to coordinate.
“In the end, you are going to get a better fit among the members, and you are going to have better satisfaction overall as a house,” Bliss said. “I think a lot of other schools have longer rush periods than USC, and I think USC is doing the right thing by increasing its rush time and by making sure people really make the right decision.” 
Paterson said he believes that expanding Greek recruitment will help students evaluate whether or not Greek life is the right fit for them. 
“It’s a commitment, but it’s a commitment that I am willing to take,” he said. “Part of rush is figuring out who you want to be as a student, and if you figure out after two weeks that this isn’t what’s best for you, then you save a lot of money.” 
Bliss also said he hopes the changes will increase participation in Greek life. In 2016, USC had over 20 fraternities. Since then, the number of fraternities has decreased to 18. With only 18 houses on the row, a large focus of rush this semester is increasing student involvement. 
“[It] is almost like [Greek life] is declining,” Bliss said. “But one way we want to increase participation among the school is [by increasing] the amount of people who join houses during rush … this process is designed to get a higher bidding percentage at the end of rush to increase participation.”
