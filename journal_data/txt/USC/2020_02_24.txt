Emily Le, a junior majoring in creative writing and art history, has found a new world within the fine arts she never intended to find. 
Through the help of the LACMA-affiliated Andrew W. Mellon Undergraduate Curatorial Fellowship, Le has found herself completely in the midst of a world of fine arts, museum curation and endless wonder that she said her younger self would have never predicted.
Le is the daughter of two Vietnamese immigrants and, as a first-generation American and college student, she was not brought into the world of fine arts until her undergraduate career. 
“As a first-gen, I knew very little about what college really was,” Le said. “I [just] happened to land in art history.” 
Le has long sensed the disadvantages placed on many who look to study the arts, whether due to culture, familial pressure or class struggles. However, Le accredits much of her ability to pursue her passion for curation to her familial support system, which may not know exactly what she aspires to do but will surely be there each step of the way. 
“It is kind of a world where people are very wealthy and elitist,” Le said. The battle to place herself in the museum space has been consistently filled with a sensation of being a step behind. 
However, Le has not allowed for this overwhelming sensation to limit her in the pursuit of coveted positions within art history and the world well beyond it. 
After years of hard work and great achievements on campus, Le has continued to seize opportunities.  She is currently flourishing in the Mellon Fellowship at LACMA, which is designed for driven, talented students from underrepresented backgrounds not directly involved in the historically exclusive community of museums and fine art.
Now in its sixth year running, the fellowship opportunity places students directly into the world of museum curation and the further study of the fine arts. As a program centered upon encouraging undergraduate students to pursue graduate programs in the fields of fine arts, those selected for the fellowship leave with knowledge of the vast possibilities in the community, ranging from curation to conservation. Students who were previously set back by their backgrounds now bring an entirely new perspective to museums nationwide, helping introduce a new population to a space that desperately needs fresh eyes.
 At LACMA, Le works under the guidance of Hollis Goodall, a curator of Japanese art who has worked at LACMA for 38 years. Goodall outlined the hectic and exciting opportunities Le has been introduced to since she was welcomed to the curation scene at LACMA. Le has had access to a few of the most prominent figures within LACMA, an opportunity not many undergraduate students have been afforded. Ranging from the heads of conservation, publications, graphics, conservation, press and marketing, Le is frequently exposed to a wide spectrum of possibilities. With this, Le was provided with direct insight into the highest levels of the functions of fine art and how these officials look to spread art to the community.
Le’s reach extends well beyond LACMA, as she also has an active presence at USC. Since her freshman year, she has been a contributor to the school’s Archeology Research Center, to which she credits much of her interest in art, history and museum culture. Le joined the lab because of a freshman year work-study opportunity and has climbed the ranks to now serve as a collections supervisor. With her interest in the field growing, she added a minor in the practice, expanding her skill set. 
At the USC Fisher Museum of Art on campus, Le co-curated an exhibit titled “Suppression, Subversion, and the Surreal: The Art of Czechoslovakian Resistance.” The exhibit delved into the political struggles in Czechoslovakia that took place after the 1960s Soviet occupation of the nation. The exhibition was well-received, as it captured the era at a time when art superseded fear in favor of expression and power. This was one of Le’s first experiences in the practice of curation and a notable moment in her artistic career.
Beyond her practice as an artist, writer and curator, Le continues to transcend the norm. April Robles, a junior majoring in psychology, has been a close friend of Le’s since their freshman year.
“She is probably the most open-minded person I know,” Robles said. “She cares about her friends a lot. Even though she has all of this going on … [She’s able to] take a step back and make time for her friends and family.”
The Mellon Fellowship has ignited a movement to make a historically exclusive space more inclusive. By extending the chance for students like Le to see the intricate workings within fine art, individuals of all backgrounds will see a new world of opportunity.

I have often thought about what it means to substantively celebrate Black History Month in an institution that may not be able to fully contextualize the premise, given that about 95% of the student demographic has no Black familial ancestry. Superficially, it seems simple to casually offer celebratory acknowledgement or to attend an event or to cheer on someone excelling in sports from the sidelines. Yet the essence of the 29 days in February are much more profound, hard fought and earned, and are truly sacred to those of us who do share the direct connection to slavery in America. 
And it seems to me, incumbent in the 21st century that, certainly in the collegial environment, we collectively move beyond the superficial to do the hard work of undoing moral confusion caused by the devaluation and dismissal of heritage that may not be shared. Sometimes we must get personal to set that example.
I thought it  might be interesting in this case to offer some of my own personal history, with the goal to make an important legacy “more real” to students, hopefully sparking curiosity as well as compassion. Thus, I am sharing one of my family’s most treasured photographs. 
It is a picture of my great-great-grandparents, seated with their children — to include my great-grandfather, standing in the right-hand corner. This is the only photo we have of my great-grandfather’s family. It is significant in several ways however, apart from the manner in which it anchors my family as Americans. 
First, this is a rare photo taken around the early 1890s, about 30 years after emancipation. What is equally notable is that this time-period marked the first in which nuclear Black families could actually legally exist, so there were not only few photos but no family records prior to this time. Families during the period of slavery were typically ripped apart and seldom knew of their parentage or siblings. I do not know of my own history beyond this image.
My great-great-grandfather was the son of the plantation owner. My great-great-grandmother was the daughter of a Ghanaian woman, who she was separated from early in her childhood. Both my great-great-grandparents had the same last name when they were married, meaning they were once considered property by the same family. Still carrying this last name as freed former slaves, my great-great-grandparents lived, worked and prayed in Jim Crow Virginia — the period of Reconstruction due to segregationist legislation that successfully disenfranchised Blacks after the Civil War. 
Having limited access to education and citizenry, my great-aunts and uncles, who are also in the picture, could only grow up to become farmers and maids. My grandfather also sharecropped alongside my great-grandfather until he left the farm as a young adult and settled in a nearby town after meeting my grandmother. He worked as a janitor and many odd jobs until he retired but was the first in his family to own his home and property. Imagine then, the glory of my father being able to break away to attend college at North Carolina A&T. 
Yet, my father’s young, exhuberant joy was short-lived, since upon discovery that he was dating my mother, he was forced to leave his classes in the dead of night under threat of lynching. My parents drove all night to Brooklyn where they were married and caught a train to San Francisco the next day, riding in separate cars, seeking safety. With a degree in nuclear engineering from UC Berkeley in hand, my father waited tables for four years until 1965, when he would be hired by Standard Oil Company after the Civil Rights Act was passed.
My brother and I attended USC as undergrads together and have since gone on to obtain multiple degrees, own businesses, create lives far removed from this photo  — but the photo remains a piece of evidence which truthfully contextualizes American history.
It is on my heart and mind daily that I am just four generations descended from former slaves. My legacy overcomes the most brutal delegitimizing circumstances, attitudes and beliefs attributed to slavery, Jim Crow and miscegenation in this country. Every time I look at this photo, I get chills knowing that my great-great-grandparents could never imagine my life today, one that is finally determined more by choice rather than by unjust design. 
And for me, this is exactly what is essential throughout our celebrations of Black History Month: the narratives that underscore the toil and hope that has been endured by others, even if not like yourself, to assure a more humane and just society. Yes, every student here at USC has benefited from this unredeemable history and has cause to embrace all there is to celebrate: lived milestones that continue to be foundational to a future devoid of race-hate, violence and bias.

Aaron Bergen was 11 years old when the original idea for his book came to him in a dream: a boy trying to save his father with a time machine. He thought it was an interesting idea, and during a weekly journal assignment in fifth grade, he wrote it down but eventually shelved it. Then, as a sophomore in high school, he found it again and picked up writing right where he left off. 
“I was reading some of it, and I was remembering all the ideas that I had were coming back to me,” said Bergen, a freshman majoring in electrical and computer engineering. “I thought, ‘This is actually a cool idea. What if I tried to keep writing it?’ So I continued writing it.”
Bergen published his debut novel “2049” last month. The 389-page book, which was self-published through Amazon’s service Kindle Direct Publishing, follows a young adult named Thomas, who discovers that his recently deceased father was working on a time machine and rebuilds the time machine to go back in time in an attempt to save his dad.  
In eighth grade, he showed his 50-page draft his middle school teacher, Sandra Woffington, a fiction writer. She was impressed. 
“I was honored because he wanted my opinion,” Woffington said. “I was just blown away instantly with his detailed imagery. He’s very creative. Each character also has a unique voice, and that’s pretty amazing for someone his age to be able to do.”
After that, Woffington’s advised Bergen to just keep writing. She was happy to hear he had published his book.
“When I heard he published, I was just absolutely thrilled,” Woffington said. “One book we read during the course of the couple of years is Mary Shelley’s ‘Frankenstein,’ and the students are always stunned she started writing it at 18. And, you know, it’s not an age that makes a good book — it’s someone who has got passion for writing.”
It wasn’t until Bergen’s junior year of high school, when he reached the 100-page mark, that he was sure he would complete and publish the book. 
“I don’t think I actually started really considering publishing it until junior year,” Bergen said. “Because, at that point, I’d already written about 100 pages. Once I reached that 100-page mark, I was pretty sure I was going to finish the whole thing and then try to get it published.” 
A fan of YouTube tutorials, Bergen considers himself a self-taught writer. He began the writing process by educating himself on how to best combat writer’s block, which he had learned could “demolish your story if you’re not careful.” Later into his high school career, Bergen did most of his writing Friday nights, often working until 2 a.m. He finished most of his book during the second semester of his senior year, following his acceptance into USC. 
“There [were] no distractions,” Bergen said. “It was just like I was in this tunnel of creativity. It’s really cool to be in that creative headspace for so long, as you end up kind of living in those ideas and in that world that you’ve kind of created.”
Bergen asked his high school friend, Haley Rovner, currently a freshman at Lewis & Clark College, to read the in-progress novel and provide feedback while they were still in high school.
“I was really impressed by the style that he used, the story development, [the] characters,” Rovner said. “And it’s just a very creative story of one that I hadn’t really seen another book like before … That was really impressive.”
Bergen then approached Kia McCormick, a freshman in the Iovine and Young Academy, who designed the cover art over winter break. McCormick said they considered four different concept designs with 10 to 15 versions per concept.  
“I haven’t done a book cover before,” McCormick said. “Going through the whole process was a very cool experience, and we had a lot of fun just trying to see how all the things put together and then when the problems arose, how to problem-solve for that.”
Bergen said he was impressed with the final product and enjoys having a physical copy of his book instead of a manuscript printed from his laptop.
“Seeing the paper — going through, flipping it with my thumb — I was like, ‘Wow, I really just wrote a book,’” Bergen said. “As an 18-year-old, that’s really cool. It was a lot of fun, and I’m really glad that I decided to do it.”
Bergen said he does not see himself writing a sequel anytime soon since his classes take priority. However, he said that if there is time in his schedule, he will consider writing another book. He said he would like to write a sequel to “2049,” since he left the book open-ended. 
“Obviously if this book takes off — which it’d be nice if it did — I would be more inclined to write a sequel,” Bergen said. “Because I kind of left it off open-ended, it could have gone to a sequel or could have ended as a stand-alone. I left the door open.”

After four years of inactivity, the Food Recovery Network of USC relaunched its food distribution drives earlier this month. The organization conducts food runs across the greater Los Angeles area on Sundays to gather surplus food from local markets and grocers. Student volunteers then redistribute more than 100 pounds of fresh produce and nonperishable items directly to students with limited access to healthy food.  
The organization was revived by Kyra Chan, a sophomore majoring in public policy, who wanted to address food insecurity on campus by providing fresh produce to students in need and share affordable healthy eating practices. Food Recovery Network works on a nationwide scale to eliminate food waste on college campuses through its redistribution efforts.
Inspired by her passion for both food and public policy, Chan said she looked for on-campus food insecurity organizations to become involved in and came across the history of the dormant Food Recovery Network. Chan said she wanted to prioritize fresh produce and healthy meal options, so she altered the national program’s mission to confront the inaccessibility of healthy food that USC students face in the midst of the South L.A. food desert. 
“People can get food, that’s not the problem,” Chan said. “People can’t get nutritious, healthy, affordable food. That’s the problem. That’s why my approach to the Food Recovery Network is specifically recovering from Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, farmers markets, straight-up farms, because that’s where the [need] is.”
Forty-five percent of college student respondents faced food insecurity in the prior 30 days, according to an April survey conducted by Temple University’s Hope Center for College, Community and Justice. 
In addition to the weekly food distributions on Sundays, the group hosts biweekly Meal Prep Mondays where they aim to teach students efficient and affordable cooking skills and provide attendees with nutritious and cheap recipes based on a CalFresh Electronic Benefit Transfer budget, a monthly benefits program that helps low-income students and households purchase sufficient food. 
“[We host meal preps] to teach them how to cook really easy, really simple, quick meals but also to make them very affordable to the lowest income,” Chan said. “We use [a CalFresh EBT] budget to base our meals off of so that whoever wants to mimic this recipe, no matter where you are on the income levels, you can afford what we’re doing.”
As a new volunteer for the organization, William Gonzalez said he appreciated the effort to keep the meals in an affordable price range for students. 
“I hope people can learn how to cook … and also budget-mindedness,” said Gonzalez, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies. “You want to make sure you have a healthy diet and then how to balance that with the amount of money you may have.” 
The Food Recovery Network of USC focuses mainly on spreading awareness about food insecurity on campus, Chan said. To expand resources for students, they specifically focus on providing access on Sunday when other organizations may not be available.  
“[L.A. has] a population that has the most individuals eligible for CalFresh, but we actually have the lowest application rate for it because a lot of people just simply don’t know that they are eligible,” Chan said. 
In addition to providing resources, Food Recovery Network creates a safe space for students who face food insecurity, such as Ruben Romeo, who said Food Recovery Network creates a space of belonging and solidarity on campus. 
“I personally think it’s nice that there’s a space where people who are going through the same adversities can come together,” said Romeo, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies. 
With support and advertising from Undergraduate Student Government, Food Recovery Network can reach all USC students in need that might be unaware of the resources available to them on campus, said Romeo, who was recently appointed to USG Senate. 
“If they can get the support that they deserve, it can be so much more in the sense of actual publicized, facilitated workshops on cooking and how to maintain a healthy nutritional intake throughout USC,” he said. “I hope that they can get the resources to kind of increase their powerhouse behind advertising.”
Although the organization was re-established this semester, Chan said she is excited to see how popular the food drives have been and looks toward increasing the volume of food she can distribute in the future once the organization grows.
“I’m already starting to see familiar faces, which means that there [are] certain students that need this every week, and I want to make sure I can do that for them,” Chan said.

This Saturday the arena will host a “Green Game” featuring compostable and recyclable stations and educational images explaining the importance of sustainability as part of a pilot study to understand the logistical and financial implications of implementing compost and recycling bins at basketball games. 
In 2014, students from the Environmental Affairs Organization’s Go Solar Campaign sent a proposal calling on USC administration to install solar panels across campus. In Fall 2015, observing that no administrative action was taking place from the proposal, the group, now known as ECore, continued to advocate for installations by organizing protests and has continued to do so since.
Now, six years later, USC is taking a step in that direction. On Saturday, the University installed solar panels at Galen Center as part of its commitment to being a carbon-free campus. The project is USC’s biggest solar energy project to date and will lead to approximately $10 million in energy savings over 25 years, according to a press release from the University.
The installation was funded by the USC Athletics Department and includes constructing a new roof to install the 1,512 solar modules. Once solar panel installation is complete, Galen Center will rely on up to 15% solar energy, the press release stated. 
Galen Center is also adopting other sustainability measures, such as the use of LED lights, placement of compost and recycling bins and installation of a pony chiller — a small machine that cools only the office spaces without using energy to cool the entire arena when games or events are not taking place at Galen Center. 
The idea to install solar panels at Galen Center started when the student organization Environmental Affairs Organization, later rebranded as Environmental Core, wrote proposals and petitions for a potential panel installation at Galen Center and submitted the findings including the amount in energy savings the Center would have and solar panels’ purchasing cost to the University in 2014.
According to a previous Daily Trojan article, the organization hosted rallies in 2016 when the University refused to hear from solar consultants and rejected the solar consultants’ proposals. Zachary Manta, who served as ECore director at the time, said when the protests occurred, ECore had expected to work on sustainability efforts with senior administration, but the organization felt ignored since there was little interest in sustainability initiatives at the time. 
“Through my junior and senior years, we … felt stonewalled,” Manta said. “Our initiatives and our attempts to go about this cooperatively just weren’t really being received, which is why I had to take a more activist bent and why we started marching down Trousdale and around Tommy Trojan with protest signs.”
According to Office of Sustainability Associate Director Ellen Dux, the initiative has since been revived as an ongoing process by the Office of Sustainability and the USC Sustainability Steering Committee and gained momentum last semester when President Carol Folt arrived and prioritized sustainability. 
When Dux heard about the movement to install solar panels at Galen Center, she knew the installation would take time but was necessary to improve energy consumption at USC. 
“[The push for sustainability is] just like change everywhere,” Dux said. “[This initiative] starts super slowly, and it seems like it’ll never go anywhere. Then you inch it along, and it picks up speed. More people support it, and then it’s like a downhill snowball — it just rolls and rolls and rolls.”
Dux said Galen Center was a good fit for the solar panels for three reasons. Galen Center passed the rooftop assessment, which checks whether the beams directly underneath the roof can carry the weight of solar panels while also assessing the size of the area. According to Facilities Management Services Energy Manager Zelinda Welch, the indoor arena used 6,906,873 kilowatt-hours and 121,385 therms in the 2019 fiscal year, and the solar panels would help reduce energy usage. Dux also mentioned the visibility of Galen Center within the community.
“[Galen Center] is highly visible to our campus, to our community around us and to people on the freeway,” Dux said. “[The installation of the solar panels] is a great opportunity for folks to visibly see USC’s commitment to sustainability.”
Welch said the installation of solar panels made sense financially because the rebates — refunds for producing and using solar energy — will end soon in Los Angeles. The center wanted to meet the deadline to receive financial benefits for solar energy, Welch said.
Galen Center general manager Paul Neidermire said the solar panel installation, like any other construction project, faced challenges with unpredictable weather. 
“The rain in [Saturday’s forecast] was a big deal,” Neidermire said. “All of a sudden, if we weren’t to do the lift today, we would miss a critical marker in our schedule. The project may have gotten behind schedule, and then we’re not hitting our ultimate deadline to get rebates from the city.”
Neidermire said it was also difficult to find a time when Galen Center would be empty to begin the installation because there were only 20 days in the year with no sports games, athletic practices or employees in the building. 
In addition to the solar panels, 3,332 new LED lights have been installed at Galen Center, dramatically reducing the amount of wasted energy. The new setup allows the sports lights to be turned off and on instantly instead of waiting 15 to 20 minutes for the switch to work.  
This Saturday, the arena will host a “Green Game” featuring compostable and recyclable stations and educational images explaining the importance of sustainability as part of a pilot study to understand the logistical and financial implications of implementing compost and recycling bins at basketball games. 
The second lift of solar panels will take place March 21, according to the press release. The solar panels will be fully functioning by mid-June.
“This is kind of a momentous time in a sense,” Welch said. “It’s really how we’re starting to look forward — not just athletics and FMS, but the University. [We’re] really taking this as an opportunity to reframe how we approach sustainability.”

A shorthanded USC men’s basketball team suffered another costly loss Sunday afternoon, falling to Utah 79-65. The defeat capped off a disappointing road trip in which the Trojans dropped two crucial games in the race for a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament.
After faltering down the stretch in a frustrating loss to Colorado Thursday evening, the Trojans were looking to rebound heading into Salt Lake City. 
Sunday’s defeat marks USC’s first Quadrant 2 loss of the season, which is not ideal timing given the Trojans’ need for impressive wins down the stretch. 
Senior forward Nick Rakocevic was battling an illness heading into the game and ultimately played just five minutes before being pulled for precautionary reasons by head coach Andy Enfield. 
“[Rakocevic] hasn’t eaten. He’s lost 10 pounds,” Enfield said after the game. “It’s hard to describe how sick he’s been the last two days.”
After losing Rakocevic, USC suffered another blow to the rotation after freshman forward Isaiah Mobley picked up an ankle injury late in the first half. Mobley was kept out for the majority of the second half despite attempting to play through the injury at the beginning of it. 
Still, the Trojans were able to stay within striking distance for the majority of the afternoon but could not close the deficit down the stretch.
After cutting the lead to as little as 4 points in the second half, a series of USC runs proved to not be enough as the team faltered in the final minutes of the game yet again.
USC was outscored by Utah 25-7 in points off turnovers. In a game that was decided by 14, USC will need to rectify this trend moving forward. 
Additionally, USC had a forgettable night from the charity stripe once again, shooting an abysmal 6-of-16 from the line, continuing to cement its place as the worst free-throw shooting team in the Pac-12.
Enfield said the poor performance from the free-throw line along with several missed opportunities from the Trojans proved costly.  
“We missed a lot of easy shots,” Enfield said. “We had open missed layups, missed some open threes and then we missed free throws. When you’re trying to win on the road down a couple of guys, you’ve got to make some of those.”
Despite the absence of two critical members of the rotation, USC was aided by timely contributions from multiple teammates, which was an encouraging sight heading into the most important games of USC’s season to this point. 
Redshirt senior guard Daniel Utomi racked up 7 points and three assists in 26 minutes and sophomore guard Elijah Weaver picked up the scoring load for the Trojans, scoring 13 points on 10 shots to go with three rebounds.
Despite the loss, the Trojans can also be encouraged by yet another dominant performance by freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu, who posted his 10th double-double of the season and led a depleted USC frontcourt with 18 points and 12 rebounds in 38 minutes.
Okongwu’s performance on the glass was his best since his 14-rebound showing in USC’s double-overtime road loss to Oregon in January. 
Sunday’s defeat extends USC’s losing streak away from Galen Center to four games, as the team’s last win on the road came two days after the aforementioned loss at Oregon in a 20-point blowout win at Oregon State. 
With just three games left in the regular season — all of which are at home — USC will be looking to close out its season on a high note and enter the Pac-12 Tournament with momentum on its side. Conference matchups with the Arizona schools and a season finale with crosstown rival UCLA will have a heavy influence on USC’s seeding in the Pac-12 Tournament and ultimately its chances at a bid in March Madness. 
Despite the upcoming slate of games, Enfield believes that the team doesn’t need to be perfect moving forward, choosing to focus on each game individually instead.
“We’ll take it game-by-game,” Enfield said. “We know that the Arizona game is big for us, they’re a ranked team and they’re very good. We just have to play a solid basketball game and just compete.”
