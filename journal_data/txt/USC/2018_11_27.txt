After the Trojans’ worst season since 2000 and a day after the decision to retain head coach Clay Helton was announced, USC purged several members of its coaching staff. 
Offensive coordinator Tee Martin, defensive line coach Kenechi Udeze and defensive backs coach Ronnie Bradford will not be a part of USC’s staff in 2019. Quarterbacks coach Bryan Ellis has also left the team to pursue a reported offensive coordinator position at Western Kentucky. 
Tee Martin
Following USC’s loss to Arizona State, Martin was relieved of play-calling duties while retaining his role as wide receivers coach and recruiter. Running back coach Tim Drevno took on the responsibility of offensive line coach after offensive line coach Neil Callaway was fired in late October. 
Martin came to USC as the wide receivers coach in 2012 under head coach Lane Kiffin. In 2015, Martin was promoted to offensive coordinator under Helton. 
USC’s poor offensive performance in 2018 left Martin at the center of much of the controversy surrounding USC football after the team lost several games due to the lack of second-half scoring. 
Kenechi Udeze
Udeze announced that he will not be returning to USC in 2019 via Twitter.
“For the last three years it has been my privilege coaching you guys in more than just football,” Udeze wrote in his statement. “I’d like to thank coach Helton and his family for my opportunity here.”
The former defensive end for USC from 2001-2003 under head coach Pete Carroll began coaching as an assistant strength and conditioning coach in 2009 under then-Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian. In 2015, Sarkisian hired Udeze as an assistant strength and conditioning coach before he was promoted to defensive line coach in 2016.
Udeze’s statement ended by thanking the players he worked with.
“I always ask you young men to thrive in adversity because in those times you truly find out who you are,” Udeze said. “Now it is time for myself to once again thrive and grow. I love you guys and can’t thank you enough for every drop of sweat you have given me over the years.” 
Ronnie Bradford
Bradford was hired by USC in 2016 to serve on defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast’s staff as a defensive backs coach after coaching defensive backs at Louisiana Tech for three seasons. 
His coaching ability was called into question after the USC secondary constantly broke down, allowing big plays and missed coverage. 
Bradford also released a statement on Twitter to voice appreciation.
“It’s been an amazing ride,” Bradford said. “This University and the fans who supported us will forever have a place in my heart. ”
Bryan Ellis
 Ellis became a full time coach in 2018 as the quarterbacks coach under Helton. Prior to becoming the full time, Ellis served as USC’s offensive quality control assistant and took part in quarterback coaching duties in the 2017 Cotton Bowl. 
Ellis is reported to have left USC to pursue an offensive coordinator position at Western Kentucky under head coach Tyson Helton, Clay Helton’s brother. 
Before coming to USC, Ellis spent three years fulfilling various coaching responsibilities at Western Kentucky. He started by assisting then-quarterback coach Tyson Helton as an offensive quality control coach in 2014, coached running backs in 2015 and was the passing game coordinator and wide receiver coach in 2016. 
Who is staying?
As of now, USC will retain five coaches under Helton: defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast, special teams coordinator John Baxter, linebackers coach Johnny Nansen, running backs coach Tim Drevno and tight ends coach Keary Colbert.

Senior forward Bennie Boatwright nabs a rebound in a swarm of Stetson defenders. (Ling Luo | Daily Trojan)
It was all happy faces from Jordan Usher and Bennie Boatwright as they took their seats to speak to the media after the basketball team’s 90-75 victory over Cal State Bakersfield on Sunday at Galen Center. 
Usher grinned and looked away when Boatwright said the sophomore guard was the “next big thing.” The senior forward also flashed a knowing grin when stating how tired he was after playing 38 minutes in his fourth game back from a knee injury.
With all the smiles, viewers would be surprised to learn Trojans had just played a tough game against an inferior yet feisty opponent. After trailing by 7 in the second half, USC pulled away with a 32-10 run over the last 11 and a half minutes. 
The run was keyed by the efforts of Usher who scored 6 of his team-high 22 points off the bench during the run and carried the Trojans offensively for much of the night. 
“It was just waiting my turn. I felt it was something coming, and I was supposed to have a game,” said Usher, who also led USC with nine rebounds. “Everyone has a night; tonight was just my night.”
Two straight 3-pointers from Boatwright put USC up 83-70 with 2:33 left, effectively ending the game.
“[Boatwright] had a pretty well-rounded game,” said head coach Andy Enfield of the senior, who scored 19 points on 50 percent shooting from both the floor and the 3-point line. “He’ll continue to get big minutes as long as he can. His shooting rate is through the roof.”
Despite failing to stop CSUB for much of the night, Enfield was pleased with how his defense clamped down during the run.
“I thought in the last six minutes, seven minutes, we did a great job of making them uncomfortable shooting,” Enfield said. “You saw some extra arc on their 3s, you saw some forced shots and that led to misses and rebounds for us. We were able to get out in transition, make the extra pass and hit some big shots.” 
The Trojans played their best defense of the night during this stretch, limiting CSUB to a 4-of-20 mark from the field, but it was a mostly disappointing effort on that end of the court. USC could not contain dribble penetration, and it turned into easy looks for the Roadrunners, as they shot 12-of-27 from deep. 
“They preached to us before the game that that was the only way they could beat us, from the 3-point line,” Boatwright said of his coaches. “They came out and they shot the ball unbelievably well.” 
Roadrunner Damiyne Durham shredded the Trojans for 22 points, making six 3-pointers. 
“He takes tough, tough shots and he makes them, so give him credit,” Enfield said of the redshirt senior guard. “He’s a great basketball player and sometimes you play as well as you can, and they still go in.” 
USC also couldn’t stay out of foul trouble. The Trojans allowed 22 free throws, although the Roadrunners only made half. The Trojans also gave up 14 offensive rebounds, leading to 16 second chance points for CSUB.
The Trojans had to rely on a strong offensive effort to keep pace and pull out the victory. 
USC shot 55.8 percent from the field and got to the line for 34 free throws, making 24. The Trojans also continued their hot outside shooting, making 10-of-22 attempts from behind the arc.
The Trojans missed guards redshirt junior Derryck Thornton and freshman Kevin Porter, two starters who sat out with an ankle and a thigh injury, respectively. Freshman guard Elijah Weaver stepped in for Thornton at the point in an up and down performance, scoring 7 points with five assists and four turnovers.
“He just has to get into a flow. He missed the entire preseason,” Enfield said. “This should be his third intra-squad scrimmage instead of a starting spot. These are the mistakes he should be making in early October versus almost December now because he missed so much time.” 
The Trojans are now 4-2 and will host Long Beach State Wednesday before a home showdown against No. 6 Nevada on Saturday.

The Trojans went undefeated in the Nugget Classic Tournament this weekend in Reno, Nevada, besting Utah State on Friday and Nevada on Sunday. The two victories improve the Women of Troy’s record to 6-0.
The Trojans opened the tournament Friday against the Aggies,  their closest game of 2018. Prior to the tournament, the Women of Troy beat their opponents by an average of 32 points.
The Trojans got off to a shaky start, as they went into halftime only up by one. But the team stayed focused and made a late rally to win 55-46. Junior guard Minyon Moore and senior guard Mariya Moore led the way with 16 points apiece for USC.
On Sunday, the Trojans faced the Wolf Pack in what was their second and final game of the Nugget Classic Tournament. This was the Trojans’ first game against the Wolf Pack since 1986.
Head coach Mark Trakh was proud of the way some of his players rose to the occasion, especially graduate student guard Cheyanne Wallace and redshirt freshman guard Shalexxus Aaron.
“We managed to put together two complete halves,” Trakh said. “It was an overall good performance.” 
 In the first quarter, it was an early back-and-forth affair, as both teams were tied halfway into the quarter. It was only a matter of time before the Trojans pulled ahead, finishing the quarter with 19 points to the Wolf Pack’s 13. USC spread the ball around well, as four different players scored; Wallace had a team high of six points.
“[Wallace] is getting better and better, she’s showing signs of life and she played the way she can play today, I couldn’t be happier,” Trakh said. “She is very capable of that, and she is such a great kid.” 
The Trojans had their most dominating performance in the second quarter. USC caught fire, outscoring Nevada 21-9. The Trojans ended the second quarter on an 8-0 run, and went into the half up by 18. Furthermore, the biggest difference in the second quarter was USC’s ability to rebound, as it had 14 rebounds (11 defensive) to Nevada’s eight. 
Coming out of the half, the Trojans started sluggish, allowing 5 points on five turnovers and committing six personal fouls in the third quarter. The Wolf Pack only turned the ball over twice and committed three personal fouls. Nonetheless, USC kept up with the Wolf Pack attack. 
USC finished the quarter with 14 points to the Wolf Pack’s 10, en route to a 54-32 score, their largest lead of the game. Junior forward Ja’Tavia Tapley led the charge for the Trojans in the third quarter, scoring 4 points and grabbing four rebounds.
In the final quarter of the game, the Trojans gave up the most points to the Wolf Pack at 19, but still kept pace scoring 18 and finishing off the game on a high note. 
Wallace led all Trojans in points, rebounds and free throws made with 19, nine and 5 respectively. With a final score of 72-51, the Women of Troy ended the Nugget Classic Tournament putting up a combined 127 points over their two games. 
Senior guard Aliyah Mazyck and junior guard Minyon Moore did not play in the team’s victory, showing just how much depth this year’s team has compared to previous seasons.
“We were missing out first and second leading scorers, who are also our two best defensive players,” Trakh said. “I’m really proud of our kids … we got some good depth this season, so that helps.”
USC has begun to gain national attention, receiving votes in the AP and USA Today Coaches polls. The Women of Troy head back home to take on the Fresno State Bulldogs Wednesday at 5 p.m. at Galen Center.

For the overwhelming amount of USC fans, the present is truly all that matters. The football team is 5-7, recruits have begun to balk on commitments, the team is playing as bad as it has in this millennium, fans are refusing to show up to games — producing record low attendance numbers — and head coach Clay Helton is standing in the center of this inferno. 
After a day which a plane flew overhead pleading to Athletic Director Lynn Swann to — “Please Fire Clay Helton,” the Trojans put on a valiant, if not predictable, losing effort in the Coliseum against archrival Notre Dame. This put the stamp on a bowl-less season for USC, its first as a sanction-less team since 2000. Moreover, this left Swann with a program-defining decision to make: Would the team continue on with Helton at the helm?
The message from the fanbase could not have possibly been clearer: USC fans want nothing to do with Helton. 
Few teams in major professional or collegiate sports today have a fanbase as enraged about a head coach as USC football. There is a difference between wanting a change and being furious with a head coach, and USC fans are clearly the latter. Thus, Swann was thrust into the spotlight, forced to make a decision between backing his head coach or alienating the fanbase. And on Sunday he made his intentions very clear: Swann is going to live or die at the hands of Clay Helton.
In a move that displayed just how tone deaf and out-of-touch the USC Athletic Director is, Swann brushed over the fact that the 2018 Trojan football product was as bad as this program has been in two decades and instead looked to spotlight how Helton pulled out 21 wins over his first two full seasons. As impressive as that may be, Swann clearly failed to recognize many of the realities of the situation.
Swann failed to see the brilliance of former quarterback Sam Darnold and how Helton has an abysmal 6-9 record with a minus-36 point differential in games where the first-round pick did not start. 
Swann failed to acknowledge how, since 2010, the year Helton arrived at USC as the quarterbacks coach, no program in the country has recruited as well as USC while still failing to play in a national championship. 
Swann failed to understand that whatever significant financial loss may come from buying out Helton’s contract pales in comparison to what the program will lose in ticket sales, merchandise and (most importantly) donations from boosters. 
Keeping Helton could turn out to be worse for business than it is for the football team, which is saying something, considering the financial impact the football program has on the University. In making this decision, Swann had not only almost no regard for the temperament of the fanbase today, but also for just how much this problem could snowball in the coming years.
In the past two years, almost every team in the Pac-12 South has made moves on the coaching staff that, at the very least, indicate progress. Aside from Utah sticking with a longtime successful coach in Kyle Whittingham, the rest of the division has fired unsuccessful coaches. 
Results from their first seasons aside, Arizona’s Kevin Sumlin, Arizona State’s Herm Edwards and UCLA’s Chip Kelly all stand as hires that, if nothing else, will challenge USC’s previously perennial stranglehold on the division. Already, it is being threatened. This season, two of those three teams beat USC head-to-head, with the third matching the Trojans record-wise. It’s clear that the division, the conference and the nation are getting more competitive, yet Swann insists on standing his ground.
Throwing the full force of his name behind Helton can only be seen as an alienating move for the NFL Hall of Famer. Like Pat Haden and Mike Garrett before him, Swann endangers his legacy as a USC football star-turned-Athletic Director by turning a blind eye to the fanbase at such a massive juncture. 
Additionally, Swann was not made available for media to take questions on Sunday after releasing the statement that Clay Helton would return in 2019. If the “us against everyone” mentality didn’t exist between USC Athletics and the fanbase before, it just might now.
At almost no point in the last 20 years has this team looked so uncompetitive, so directionless, so far beneath acceptable standards as it does today. If this is the kind of program USC fans are expected to see, they will surely find other things to do and teams to watch. 
Los Angeles is a city filled with sporting and non-sporting distractions. Every team here knows what it is like to play in front of an empty stadium and now, thanks to the ignorance of Swann, it may be USC’s time.

Directed by Peter Farrelly, “Green Book” explores the true story of the unlikely friendship between a black pianist and an Italian American bouncer in the 1960s. The film stars Viggo Mortensen (left) and Mahershala Ali (right). (Photo from IMDb)
“Based on a true friendship” reads the tagline for “Green Book.” The new film, led by the talented duo of Academy Award nominee Viggo Mortensen and Academy Award winner Mahershala Ali went into wide release last weekend after a limited release on Nov. 16. 
“Green Book” is a classic feel-good movie that doesn’t shy away from depicting the prejudices rampant in the Deep South during the 1960s, but rather expresses how friendship can break down ideological rifts. 
Set in 1962, Mortensen plays Tony Lip, a thick-blooded Italian from the Bronx who does whatever he can to support his wife Dolores (Linda Cardellini) and two kids. After a friend recommends him as a chauffeur and personal assistant to a certain Dr. Shirley (Ali), Tony is hired to guide Shirley on his tour through the Deep South as a concert pianist. 
Tony’s subtle racism is prevalent from the get-go. In an early moment, he furtively throws away glasses used by two black plumbers; he’s quiet as he does it, but the action is a product of a deeply rooted understanding of the world. In Dr. Shirley, Tony is introduced for the first time to a man who defies categorization and stereotypes: Shirley does not know Aretha Franklin or eat fried chicken or talk in a certain dialect — all things Tony readily and openly attributes to “[Shirley’s] people.” 
In fact, Dr. Shirley is a highly cultured man with a few doctorates to spare. He sees in Tony a tough guy from the Bronx who could easily embarrass him at his aristocratic concerts and garden parties if he isn’t subdued. Throughout their journey, they find in one another a common humanity and an earnest desire to help each other. Eventually, Tony vehemently defends Dr. Shirley when he experiences discrimination, and Dr. Shirley turns Tony’s slangy letters to his wife into romantic expressions that earn Tony the nickname “Shakespeare” among his brothers. 
“Green Book” is both a hilarious and insightful clash between two polar opposite characters. In one particular exchange, Shirley becomes aware that Tony has stolen a small Jade rock from a gas station and sternly demands he return it. Tony’s stubborn, childlike denial of guilt before Shirley’s harsh inquisition make for a humorous impasse of personalities in this, as well as many other scenes. 
Bringing this dichotomy to life are Mortensen and Ali, two highly skilled actors who remain remarkably consistent in their respective roles. Mortensen’s boisterous Tony can teeter on caricature at times, but he knows when to dial back the New York greaser persona to show some emotion. Mortensen is superb as the tough guy softie, especially in scenes with or relating to Tony’s wife. 
Ali is the standout of the film as Dr. Shirley. From his posture to his pursed lips, he effortlessly conveys every detail the audience needs to know about his character. He is cultured, dignified and experienced — the immovable object to Tony’s unstoppable force. 
When their tour of the South concludes, Tony and Dr. Shirley part ways on Christmas Eve, but it’s clear by the look on their faces that they want to spend it together. These two completely distinct personalities, pitted against each other for two months on the road, have produced a beautiful friendship. “Green Book” is truly heartwarming because it is a testament to the power of friendship to override deep-rooted prejudices, a message sorely needed in divisive times.

British pop singer Rita Ora returns to the music scene with “Phoenix,” her second studio album. (Photo courtesy of Atlantic Records UK)
Everybody seems to have heard Rita Ora’s name, but nobody seems to know from where. Whether one’s familiarity with the British singer and actress comes from her 2014 chart-topper “I Will Never Let You Down” or her small role in the “Fifty Shades” sequels or her role of host on “America’s Next Top Model,” it is clear that the artist’s talent is multifaceted. On Friday, Ora released “Phoenix,” her second studio album after a six-year hiatus.
About half of the songs on “Phoenix” have had radio play over the past 18 months, with “For You (feat. Liam Payne)” being promoted for the movie “Fifty Shades Freed” and “Your Song” hitting the charts in May 2017.
Despite her endeavors as a model and actress, Ora seems determined to keep music at the forefront of her career with “Phoenix.”
Like her  album’s namesake, Ora metaphorically rises from the ashes on “Phoenix.” The album represents her newly reclaimed  power and freedom as an artist, and was created while Ora fought a long legal battle with her former record label Roc Nation.
Rather than depicting a complete reformation of Ora’s past music, the album is a continuation of her previous sound.
With bubbly pop melodies and colorful synths, the tracks on “Phoenix” depict the dark underbelly of Ora’s party girl image — not just the carefree, dancing queen her public persona portrays. On “New Look,” Ora reveals her insecurities about being left behind for someone better. In “Let You Love Me,” her personality is guarded and her walls are up. And on the previously criticized “Girls (feat. Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX),” Ora announces her bisexuality, which she now publicly embraces.
The production value of the album outweighs the lyrical content, which make for a pleasant listen but result in few takeaways. The message Ora tries to impart through her music gets lost in an attempt at bubblegum pop. 
Ora’s range of breathy and full vocals complement the bold beats and instrumentation underlying her tracks. 
On certain tracks, such as “Keep Talking (feat. Julia Michaels),” Ora  is at her best — showcasing her sultry side with mesmerizing synths and airy vocals. 
But “Phoenix” lacks lyrical substance; Ora’s songs can be reduced to generic pop anthems about love, heartbreak and the troubles of fame.
With plenty of features, “Phoenix” is a musical representation of a night out with friends and just like any good night out, the album feels a little hazy once fully digested.
While sonically cohesive, the album’s message lacks power and edge. Considering Ora’s abrasive but confident voice on social media, “Phoenix” lacks the empowering aggression or inspiration that fans expect in her music.
Ora doesn’t necessarily sound confident on this record either. Rather, she seems to be coping with a past self with whom she finally comes to terms. A lack of confidence can be a relatable and, sometimes empowering admission in pop — such as in Demi Lovato’s “Skyscraper” or Taylor Swift’s “Delicate.” But, on “Phoenix,” Ora’s uncertain approach to her party girl persona only serves to alienate her listeners.
Hopefully fans won’t have to wait another six years for Ora’s  next album, because hopefully it will be more impactful. On “Phoenix,” Ora is still finding her voice as an artist. While the upbeat melodies ensure that these songs will be party hits,  none of the album’s tracks are distinctive of her style. As a whole, “Phoenix” is an album for a night out — not one that will be remembered in the morning.

Sydney Loew | Daily Trojan
“Oh my gosh, this is probably so awkward, but I’ve seen your videos before!”
I hear this at least once a week, but it used to be an almost daily occurrence: in class, in passing, at parties, from friends new and old. I can’t escape the life I put online, even though I did it to myself.
Influencer marketing is a new phenomenon that’s taken over social media in the past five years. An influencer is someone who’s able to make a brand out of their lifestyle and utilize social media — predominantly YouTube and Instagram — to “influence” their followers to buy into that lifestyle. Whether they’re a micro-influencer (100,00 followers generally) or large-scale influencer, these public figures also often collaborate with brands to promote products that align with their personal brands, known as “brand deals.”
For those who don’t know, I’m an ex-influencer — or, at least, an ex-sad attempt at one. I started making YouTube videos when I was nine, and created a mildly successful series of college application-themed videos during my senior year of high school. I had a business plan: College-themed videos excel on YouTube, and I built a foundation of trust with my audience with regard to college application advice by documenting every college I applied to. USC is a YouTube influencer-heavy school, and since I’d been accepted, I knew making USC-oriented content would be popular among eager prospective students like myself. So, I made a variety of demandable videos: Standardized test advice, essay advice, an orientation vlog, a dorm tour and “How I Got a Full Scholarship to USC,” my most-viewed video.
The summer before college, I continued producing videos on a weekly basis. Once I moved into my freshman dorm, however, all my feelings toward influencing changed.
About a year ago, I stopped making videos, despite originally planning to grow my channel as a college YouTuber. To this day, I still get questions about why I stopped and I’ve mostly withheld the true reason I suddenly stopped pursuing a lifestyle I had worked toward for so long. Fellow internet fanatics, here’s the tea.
Being an influencer is not a sustainable lifestyle. I say this after watching many content creators I follow crash into ailing mental health, seeing my influencer friends grow tired of constantly putting their lives online and remembering how disengaged my own life was when I lived through a camera lens. The reality is that views, likes and comments become your entire life because your life is no longer yours alone to live. Your personal life becomes a product, and the line between reality and marketable content becomes blurred.
During the first few months of my freshman year, I was still focused on producing weekly content. Consequently, I never felt that I was fully engaged in my new USC community. Planning, filming and editing videos would take a significant amount of time spent alone. Even when I wasn’t actively making videos, everything around me triggered a voice in my head: “This or that could be worthy content.”
Because so many of my videos were centered on USC, I had unintentionally created a microcosm on campus for myself. Whenever I met people, I often had to wonder if they already had some preconceived notion of me based on my videos or not. I wasn’t happy, and I wasn’t healthily adjusting to life on campus. Eventually, I came to a crossroads: Do I grow my channel in spite of my personal life, or do I abandon it completely and pursue a more fulfilling life offline?
I chose the latter and haven’t looked back since.
My experience, however, is not indicative of the entire influencer community because I recognize I existed on a very, very small scale compared to those who have made a career out of content creation. I have friends who are actively pursuing the influencer lifestyle — what I see as new-age internet entrepreneurship — and are thriving. If anything, influencer marketing has absolutely revolutionized advertising, and I fully believe influencers are the future of product marketing. I’ll root for those in front of the camera, but I’m perfectly happy staying behind the scenes on the managerial side.
Sure, maybe I could have been a successful influencer. Sure, I still get comments and messages asking me about my old videos. I don’t at all mind engaging with this past version of myself, but it’s just that: the past. I may no longer be the high school girl who made videos in her bedroom, but she will always be a part of me.

My high school has a program called “Teen Pep,” which features upperclassmen performing wacky skits to promote safe sex and STI prevention. 
I disliked the program because one of the five seminars was titled “Postponing Sexual Involvement.” In fact, I disliked it so much that I wrote an article for the school’s satirical newspaper titled: “Teen Pep to Take Over Driver’s Education, Dedicate Curriculum to ‘Postponing Vehicular Activity.’”
I was too judgmental. Teen Pep made a respectable effort to educate students about both preventative and remedial birth control and STI protection. 
Additionally, there isn’t anything wrong with partially promoting abstinence; it’s the most effective form of birth control and STI prevention. Excessive or exclusive promotion of abstinence is where sexual education starts to fail.
When considering what topics should be taught in sex ed, it’s important to understand that teenagers are going to have sex. They are going to have sex regardless of whether they are taught safe sex, and they are going to have sex even if they promise otherwise. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, more than half of U.S. teenagers have sex by age 18, and according to a study by researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, over half of teenagers who pledge celibacy have sex before marriage and have a higher rate of STI contraction and premarital pregnancy than those who don’t pledge. 
Though it is important to remember that correlation does not imply causation, these statistics help explain why a joint study between Indiana University and the University of Georgia found that the more a state’s sexual education curriculum focuses on abstinence, the higher its teen pregnancy rate. The study’s findings were consistent even when controlled for socioeconomic factors such as household income and race.
But these socioeconomic factors are critical to understanding how teenage pregnancy disproportionately harms already disadvantaged populations. According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unwanted Pregnancy, 48 percent of teen mothers live below the poverty line, and 67 percent of teen mothers who move out of their own families’ home live in poverty. Teen parenthood is the most common cause of girls dropping out of school, with approximately 50 percent of teen mothers never graduating from high school and less than 2 percent obtaining a college degree by age 30.
These socioeconomic impacts carry all kinds of long-term and cyclical consequences. According to the Schuyler Center for Analysis and Advocacy, children born to teen parents are nearly three times as likely to be incarcerated at a young age than the children of older parents, and the daughters of teen parents are 22 percent more likely to become teen mothers themselves.Effectively, teen pregnancy is a result of poverty, which can lead to crime, more poverty and, ultimately, more teen pregnancy. It’s a vicious cycle, and the consequences predominantly affect the country’s most vulnerable communities.   
Yet, there is reason for hope. Teen pregnancy is dropping at an impressive rate, and that can largely be accredited to the increasing presence of “comprehensive” sexual education as opposed to abstinence-only education, a trend that has received scrutiny from the Trump administration.
 In 2010, Congress created the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, which aims to fund organizations focusing on comprehensive sexual education. But in 2017, the Department of Health and Human Resources tried to remove funding from TPPP organizations to favor other, more conservative programs that emphasized “abstinence until marriage.” 
Fortunately, in April, a federal judge in the state of Washington issued a permanent injunction ordering the administration to continue funding the program, marking the second time a federal court had to make this order.
 The effects of teen pregnancy, and the effects of abstinence focused sexual education are too well documented and understood for this to be just another trench battle in the endless culture war. We now know that time spent scaring teenagers away from sex entirely can be better used teaching them how to have safe sex, and the correct course of action isn’t to remove funding from effective programs, but the answer also isn’t to just fund individual comprehensive sex-ed programs.
 There is currently no federally mandated sexual education curriculum, which has led to 26 states mandating that abstinence be stressed in public schools, and 11 states not having any mandated sexual education at all. 
Studies have shown repeatedly that the less stress put on abstinence, the better the outcomes, regardless of location. So if lawmakers truly want to increase economic mobility, reduce crime and empower women, they must push for a federally mandated comprehensive sexual education curriculum.
 Teenage pregnancy is becoming less and less of a problem in every regard. It’s time to capitalize on the momentum that educators have built, not go back to the archaic philosophies that enabled the problem in the first place.

Despite backlash from fans following a 5-7 record, Clay Helton will continue as football head coach. (Daily Trojan file photo)
Amid a social media firestorm calling for head coach Clay Helton’s firing following the football program’s first losing season since 2000, Athletic Director Lynn Swann announced that Helton would remain in his position next season. 
The decision reverberates far beyond the football field, where Helton’s play-calling and game preparation were called into question, where fans booed him off the Coliseum field, held up signs and even financed a plane with a banner calling for his firing to circle the Coliseum. The decision reflects poorly on a University already embroiled in multiple non-athletics scandals having to make a pivotal decision on one of its most public, highly paid figures. It exemplifies a University that prioritizes continuity over change, even if logic points toward the latter. And it reflects on the concept of USC’s Trojan Family, which — in this case — proved to be impractical and excessive.
“I am a strong advocate of consistency within a program, sticking by a leader, supporting them and helping them and their team improve,” Swann wrote in a press release. With so bold a declaration, Swann is taking a massive risk by inexplicably linking his fate to Helton’s. From here on out, Helton’s failures will be Swann’s failures. 
For a school still reeling from scandals and struggling to find a permanent president, perhaps conducting yet another search for a football head coach was too much to ask. 
In February, the Los Angeles Times reported that donations to USC had fallen nearly $100 million between July and December 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Though the $215 million the University owes to victims of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall will be covered by insurance, slapping on dead money of what was reported to be a buyout of over $20 million for Helton would not have been appealing. 
But the strategy could backfire. With apathy growing among once-dedicated fans and empty seats ubiquitous at the Coliseum — USC failed to draw 60,000 fans for any games this season — keeping Helton gives fans even less of a reason to buy tickets for the 2019 season and beyond. What the school may save in buyout money and a new coach’s salary, it could easily lose in ticket sales, donations and advertisements. 
The decision also reeks of blind loyalty. USC has consistently turned to previous star players to run the athletic department, whether it’s Swann (an All-American wide receiver at USC in the 1970s), his predecessor, Pat Haden (USC’s quarterback in the ’70s) or Haden’s predecessor Mike Garrett (who won the Heisman Trophy in 1965 with USC). None had prior experience at an athletic department before taking charge at USC, yet they were immediately tasked with running one of the most prestigious sports institutions in the country. 
Against this backdrop, Swann was faced with a simple question: to fire or not to fire, to give in to the growing backlash or to stick with the status quo? He took the easy way out by retaining Helton and upholding the concept of the Trojan Family; every USC head coach since Pete Carroll has been under the Caroll “branch” — Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian were both assistants under Carroll, and Helton was Sarkisian’s offensive coordinator before taking over in 2015.
While loyalty seems to be one of USC’s biggest strengths — whether it be leaning on past coaches or its endless alumni network — giving a coach with a 5-7 record a pat on the back and vote of confidence is a questionable decision. Despite its current state, USC is still a prestigious program, a job that many coaches would love to take. It wouldn’t take much for Swann or any Athletic Director to pry away a good coach at a smaller program to run USC. 
Instead, Swann gave Helton an extension through 2023 — before this season even started. He didn’t even consider the fact that options outside USC might be available. He knotted himself to Helton then, and he double-knotted it on Sunday. 
“Some will be happy that Coach Helton remains our coach, others will not,” Swann said. 
Time will tell if Swann’s gamble pays off. But in the case that keeping Helton was perhaps a riskier decision than firing him, USC has put itself in situation where it yet again is facing fierce criticism.

Some audience members and production staff said the Thornton School of Music’s production of “Le Rossignol” inappropriately depicted Chinese culture. The opera ran at Bing Theatre last weekend. (Sasha Urban | Daily Trojan)
Controversial cultural depictions of China in USC Thornton School of Music’s production of “Le Rossignol” frustrated some audience members, orchestra members and performers after the show’s run at the Bing Theatre last weekend. 
Some accused the department of incorporating yellowface and cultural appropriation into the opera, which is set in imperial China.
“The costuming and the staging could have been done a lot more tastefully … it felt offensive to me,” said Tiffany Chung, a first-year Korean American graduate student who played violin for the production.
The production featured a multi-ethnic cast of actors, some of whom wore caps with long braids hanging from the back — mimicking the queue hairstyle worn by men during the Qing Dynasty. Some female cast members also utilized chopsticks as hair accessories. 
Several attendees accused the opera department of exoticizing Chinese culture with culturally ambiguous choreography and costumes that inaccurately mimicked traditional Chinese garb. One attendee cited the prevalence of the color yellow in costumes as an example. 
“Only emperors were allowed to wear yellow … that makes me feel like they did zero research,” said a Chinese American audience member and USC graduate who wished to remain anonymous due to employment concerns in the field of opera. 
“Le Rossignol,” or “The Nightingale,” premiered in 1918 and was based on the 1844 Hans Christian Andersen fairytale of the same name. The opera tells the story of a Chinese emperor who, after trying and failing to control a coveted nightingale, learns the limitations of his power. The one-act opera was performed as part of a double bill with “L’Enfant et les Sortilèges,” which took up the second act of the production. 
Director Ken Cazan said “Le Rossignol” was intended to match the similar themes of the second opera, which was chosen first. Cazan said he did not see any issues with the production’s casting or costume design.
“We made no pretense that they were Asian for a second,” Cazan said. “There were clearly a lot of European-based people up on that stage.”
He said it was fine that the traditional Chinese garb may have given that impression. 
“Well sure they do, but that’s how you costume a show, I do believe,” he said. 
The show’s costume designer did not respond to requests for comment. 
This is not the first time “The Nightingale” has sparked controversy. In 2012, a musical adaptation of the opera at the La Jolla Playhouse received backlash for casting only two actors of Asian descent in a cast of 12, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
The second opera, “L’Enfant et les Sortilèges,” or, “The Child and the Spells,” which told the story of a young child whose room of inanimate objects comes to life, was tied to the first act by one of the child characters who appeared in both acts. The child from “L’Enfant et les Sortilèges” appeared in the cast of “Le Rossignol,” observing the story through a large picture book to contextualize Le Rossignol as a figment of the child’s imagination. 
Allen Pearcy Galeana, a Mexican American student who played one of the Japanese emissaries in “Le Rossignol,” said he didn’t see an issue with the production because of the change in context. 
“Once it’s contextualized in that way, it’s surrealism,” said Pearcy Galeana, a senior majoring in vocal arts. “When you dream, you dream of faces of people that you randomly see on the street, so it’s that.” 
However, he said he would not have the same opinion for a professional production of “Le Rossignol.” 
“For a piece like this, given that we’re in an educational institution, we have a pretty diverse class of opera singers,” Pearcy Galeana said. “I don’t see the absolute need for [an all-Asian cast], because, given the context, I think it’s fine.” 
Chung said the opera’s costume design was not justified by the change in context. 
“I don’t really care what they think is a child’s idea of China,” Chung said. “Quite frankly, I think that’s a load of B.S.” 
Cazan said none of the cast members raised any concerns about the opera’s casting or artistic design, but speaking out isn’t always easy in the small world of opera.
Several audience members with experience in opera said they were offended by “Le Rossignol,” but wished to remain anonymous out of concern that their comments might adversely affect their careers in the operatic field. 
“I understand why people didn’t say anything,” said one audience member who recently graduated from UCLA’s undergraduate music performance program. “These singers are hoping to have a career in opera. It’s hard to do that if you get a reputation for talking shit about the shows that you’re in.” 
In opera, an art form that has only recently begun to address systemic issues, the dialogue surrounding race is relatively unprecedented. There are no readily available statistics on Asian American representation in classical voice, but a report by the Asian American Performers Action Coalition found that Asian American actors were cast in only 4 percent of New York City stage roles for the 2015-16 theater season. The report also noted that only one Asian American actor was cast in a Broadway play in an ensemble role that year.
“[Opera is] like any other art form in that it has certain things that are problematic because it’s been around for hundreds of years,” said the UCLA graduate. “Those things don’t disqualify it as a valuable art form, but they do need to be addressed delicately.”

The company will halt retail sales of fruit-flavored e-cigarette pods and suspend social media promotions to prevent underage users from obtaining Juul e-cigarettes. (Gabriela Thur DeKoos | Daily Trojan)
On Nov. 13, electronic cigarette company Juul Labs announced it would halt sales of its fruit-flavored e-cigarette pods and consequently suspend all social media promotions.
USC students, some of whom are Juul enthusiasts, shared their thoughts on the company’s latest move, and how it might affect the student body’s smoking culture.
“I don’t really think that [USC] is different from most colleges … in terms of the target audience of e-cigarettes,” said Megan Tebbenhoff, a senior majoring in neuroscience and international relations. “They’re so discreet and so easy to use that it kind of fosters the ability to bring it to class and bring it on campus and not have any repercussions or issues.”
Juul Labs, which launched in 2015, has faced backlash this year among regulatory agencies and consumers for alleged deceptive marketing strategies and encouraging underage smoking and nicotine use, according to The Washington Post.  
The company currently faces a nationwide class action lawsuit for causing nicotine addiction among users. According to the Food and Drug Administration, approximately 3.6 million youth under 18 reported having used e-cigarettes.
The e-cigarettes Juul sells can easily pass for a USB drive; the devices are portable, and can be charged on laptop computers. 
Tebbenhoff said that some of the biggest problems with e-cigarettes include their accessibility and casual nature. 
“With cigarettes, cigars, any other tobacco products, you have to step outside or go to a specific place,” Tebbenhoff said. “But with something like this, you can smoke it inside of pretty much any building without anyone really noticing and I have seen that a lot … People can smoke in class, which is kind of crazy.”
Earlier this year, the FDA announced that it would pursue a series of measures, including a complete ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, in an effort to curb teenage nicotine addiction. Juul Labs halted the retail sale of all fruit flavors before the FDA regulations went into effect, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Shelby Emami, a sophomore majoring in international relations, believes that the company’s decision to ban the non-traditional flavors will fail to curb the magnitude of the problem. 
“I guess they would stop selling it because it is less appealing to the kids … but once they develop the[smoking] habit, I don’t think the flavors really matter any more,” Emami said. “I think they are going to still Juul because they are addicted to it now.”
Tessa Igler, a freshman majoring in international relations, said that if teenage nicotine addiction is such a big problem, teens will find other alternatives.
“I think that there are so many options in nicotine devices that if people really are dedicated to continuing to fuel their addiction, then they are going to find other ways to do it,” Igler said.
While the company has halted its retail sales of the fruit-flavored pods, consumers are still able to purchase the flavors online through the company site. It will ask customers to provide their name, date of birth, address and last four digits of their social security number in order to verify that they are over 21. 
“Juul Labs is committed to improving the lives of the world’s one billion adult smokers, with the ultimate goal of eliminating cigarettes,” CEO Kevin Burns wrote in a statement on the company’s  site. “While we have been working to solve that problem, another unintended and serious problem has developed — underage use of e-cigarettes, including Juul.”
According to the L.A. Times, Juul Labs will close its social media accounts, losing more than 77,000 followers on Instagram and 10,000 followers on Facebook.
“Our intent was never to have youth use Juul,” Burns said in a statement to The New York Times. “But intent is not enough. The numbers are what matter and the numbers tell us underage use of e-cigarettes is a problem.”
Caitlin Rowe, a freshman majoring in environmental engineering, said that the problem with Juul is not the flavored pods, but, ultimately, the concept of the e-cigarette.
“Overall, kids or teenagers are attracted to Juul because it’s a new technology,” Rowe said. “Everyone wants the a new computer, the newest phone. And this is something that is tiny and sleek and looks like a USB drive and it’s attractive [for] this generation … The issue isn’t necessarily the flavors, but more of the entire product itself.”
