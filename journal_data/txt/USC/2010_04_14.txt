The iconic dome-shaped building on Hoover Street and Adams Boulevard has been converted into a center for events and speakers and, after Wednesday’s introductory ceremony, is ready for its grand opening.

The new Art of Living Center, formerly the Christian Science Center, will be christened Thursday with a Business, Ethics and Spirituality seminar sponsored by a number of USC groups, including the Yoga and Service Club, the Office of Religious Life, the Center for Religion and Civic Culture, and the Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics.
The building at Hoover and Adams is now owned by the Art of Living Foundation and is intended to be the foundation’s West Coast base and will be used for various cultural and religious events and speakers.
Members of the USC community are excited about the possibilities presented by the new Art of Living Center.
“[This] location is exciting for us at USC,” said Varun Soni, dean of the USC Office of Religious Life. “Now, between Jefferson and Adams on Hoover, there are a number of religious institutions that collectively comprise a vibrant ‘Religion Row’ in Los Angeles.”
Among these organizations are the University Religious Center, United University Church, USC Hillel, USC Catholic Center, USC Latter-Day Saints, USC Chabad and Hebrew-Union College. The Art of Living Center adds to the diversity of this collection of religious institutions, Soni said..
“We believe the community around USC will benefit from the renovation of this beautiful historic building near our campus and from the programs the Art of Living Foundation will provide,” said Lyn Boyd-Judson, director of USC’s Levan Institute.
The Art of Living Foundation “engages in a wide array of educational and humanitarian programs that uplift individuals, make a difference in local communities and foster global change,” according to the foundation’s website. Established by spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the organization offers a variety of programs for people of all ages, including empowerment seminars, yoga and service projects.
Shankar himself will be at the Business, Ethics and Spirituality seminar Thursday. The seminar will also feature the founder of Paul Mitchell Systems, John Paul DeJoria, and professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek.
DeJoria actively contributes to environmentally friendly causes and has donated generously to a range of charities. Dyrdek recently created the Safe Spot Skate Spot park to make skateboarding possible for cities who do not have sufficient funds to develop skating terrain and has worked with the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
Leaders of the organizations involved are excited both for the event and for the new center.
“The themes explored in this event — those of ethics, morality and social entrepreneurship — are central to our mission at both USC and the Office of Religious Life,” Soni said.
Matt Scharpnick, director of College Programs for the Art of Living Foundation, said he thinks the speakers will be engaging and he is hoping the event will kick-off a long run of successful events at the Art of Living Center.
“[Shankar] is an incredible individual,” he said. “[He] has inspired millions with practical ways to live life more fully while taking more responsibility to help others.”
The foundation celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2007 and proceeded to purchase its first United States headquarters in Washington D.C. The Los Angeles center was dedicated to AOLF as part of its new “Violence-Free, Stress-Free” mission. Groups at USC are already anticipating the positive impacts of this new center.
Thursday’s event, which begins at 7 p.m., is the first of many events the Art of Living Center will be holding. More programs will be scheduled through May.

For the first time ever, the University of California and California State University systems are putting prospective students on wait lists, distancing some students and encouraging others to opt for schools who choose not to use the wait-list system, including USC.
Wait lists have now become the new standard for UCs and CSUs because of state budget cuts. Wait lists allow UC and CSU campuses to modify the admission process so they reach their enrollment goals accurately and avoid over-enrolling.
“This gives them the opportunity to take additional students if it turns out they have a little bit of space at the end of the [admissions] process,” Susan Wilbur, UC’s director of undergraduate admissions, said in a press release.
The UCs received a record amount of applications this year: 134,029. The same is true for CSU; more than 609,000 students applied, setting an all-time record.
Several UC campuses have put a few hundred students on wait lists, while others have wait-listed several thousand. The Merced and Los Angeles campuses are the only two that will not be using wait lists.
Additionally, approximately 8,000 applicants statewide have been wait-listed at CSU, spokeswoman Claudia Keith said in a press conference.
Experts say students placed on the wait list should be prepared to attend other schools. Students can easily accept admission to another school, and if taken off the wait list, can revoke their agreement.
A controversial issue for prospective students, many educational experts and high school counselors argue that this wait list system will only frustrate students and send them to other California or even out-of-state schools, further decreasing in-state profits. This leads students toward schools that do not use wait lists, including USC.
“Students in Southern California dream about joining the UC system, but wait lists just degrade them and their self-esteem, making them aim for other schools outside of it,” said Andrew Daneshgar, a junior at The Buckley School in Los Angeles who is currently looking into colleges for the fall 2011 semester.
Instead of wait lists, USC has always opted to admit a small group of students for the spring semester to balance out the number of incoming students for the new freshman class.
“We don’t like the idea of saying, ‘It’s maybe, but maybe not,’” said Katharine Harrington, USC’s dean of admission and financial aid, in a press release. “We much prefer to say, ‘We want you to come, but in the spring.’”

The USC School of Pharmacy has established a new academic partnership with a medical university in Armenia, continuing a tradition of reaching out to other countries to help improve pharmacy education programs around the world.
USC was selected from a competitive group of applicants to partner with Yerevan State Medical University, a medical school in Armenia. The decision to partner USC with Yerevan State was made by the Competitive Armenian Private Sector Project group, which seeks to ensure that pharmacy education in Armenia will effectively satisfy employer needs.
Michael Wincor, associate dean of globalization and continuing professional development at the School of Pharmacy, visited Armenia in March to pitch his partnership proposal to the CAPS group.
“[Yerevan State] sought out Dr. Wincor to come over and assist them in how to design a Pharm.D. program or at least a clinical program,” said R. Pete Vanderveen, dean of the School of Pharmacy. “They are trying to move in the direction of direct patient care.”
Wincor said the partnership will be a good way for USC to play a role in improving pharmacy education.
“The suggestions that we will make will help to improve the education they are receiving there,” Wincor said. “It also will ultimately result in a higher level of clinical pharmacy practice, which will make their careers that much more satisfying.”
Members of CAPS are equally optimistic about the partnership.
“It is anticipated that the academic partnership initiative will eventually bridge the knowledge gap and substantially reduce labor migration,” Anush Shahverdyan, the CAPS workforce development specialist, told the Public Radio of Armenia.
USC faculty will likely be visiting Armenia later this year to work with the professors teaching pharmacy courses, Wincor said. He added that there will also be chances for students to participate in the program. 
“Assuming that this relationship becomes relatively longstanding, which we are optimistic about, there will be opportunities for student exchanges.” Wincor said.
He added that several students from the School of Pharmacy have already visited Armenia to learn about the pharmaceutical system there.
Pharmacy students said they are excited about the partnership and eager to participate in the new program.
“It exposes our school to a global audience and helps build our reputation internationally,” said Daniel Szeto, a fourth-year pharmacy student. “I think it’s always good to see how pharmacy is practiced in different areas around the world.”
Wincor said he feels USC was chosen for this partnership largely because of the School of Pharmacy’s prestige, but he added that USC’s history of globalization also helped.
“They recognized that we, both as a school and as an entire university, have a strategic initiative to work with international partners.” Wincor said.
According to Wincor, the School of Pharmacy has started both formal and informal academic exchange agreements with more than 25 worldwide universities, mainly throughout Asia, but reaching across Europe, South America, Australia and Africa as well.
Vanderveen said the school is frequently sought out for help internationally.
“We have opportunities on a monthly basis of schools coming from around the country seeking a partnership,” Vanderveen said. “We don’t have unlimited time, and so we have to be somewhat selective on those. But we do believe in the strategic plan of the university, which is to be global.”

The new Undergraduate Student Government executive officers are gearing up to boost USG’s presence around campus by reaching out to incoming students, offering more programming and taking advantage of its space in the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The outgoing USG administration made significant efforts to bridge the gap between USG and students, and the new executive officers hope to continue this trend.
“A lot of times students don’t know who to complain to,” said incoming Chief of Staff Maya Babla. “We want to be seen as as valuable a resource as possible.”
Senior Director of Communications Elizabeth Trower said her biggest goal is to assist USG President Chris Cheng and Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen with their platform. To do so, her first move will be to create informational booklets and pamphlets to be handed out during summer orientations and Welcome Week.
“We want to make USG’s name more present on campus,” Trower said. “Some students don’t have a solid understanding of what USG does, so we’re going to put out more information. We want to get future Trojans excited so hopefully that will carry through their four years here.”
One pamphlet will describe the various branches of USG and how to get involved. The other will include advice from upperclassmen to freshmen and will feature students discussing how USG impacts life on campus.
“This is really a dynamic grassroots campaign,” Trower said.
Program Board Finance Director Chris McAbery and Executive Director of Program Board Richard Pizano have already begun their outreach. Program Board issued surveys to students during Springfest to gather information about what kind of talents students are interested in.
USG Treasurer Brian Anderson said he hopes increasing USG’s publicity will lead to more student groups applying for funding. Anderson specifically hopes to publicize the new online funding application system.
“We want every student organization to know they can get money from USG,” Anderson said.
The executive officers hope USG’s location in the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center will help make USG more accessible. They also hope to play a role in integrating the campus center into student life.
“We want to ensure that everything at the campus center is running smoothly and making sure students know the spaces available,” Babla said. “With the campus center up and running, USG will be more accessible.”
With the campus center’s new facilities, USG and Program Board will be able to put on events that cater to a medium group of students — about 200 to 300 students — rather than only large or small events.
“We’re going to start programming events that utilize the new venues,” Pizano said. “It will hopefully bring more dynamics to the students and diversify our programming.”
The move to the new campus center also means USG and Program Board will be sharing a new office. McAbery said it will be interesting to see how the dynamic between USG and Program Board changes with the move.
“There’s been a bit of a disconnect between Program Board and USG,” McAbery said. “We’re looking forward to sharing space so that everyone in the organization will be better updated and more familiar with what’s going on with the whole organization as a whole.”
Beyond increasing publicity and accessibility, USG hopes to grow its endowment to help ensure the student programming fee does not increase in coming years.
“We don’t want the student fee to be a burden, I mean, tuition is enough,” Anderson said. “We’re looking for ways to alleviate students financially and we’re constantly evaluating procedures to make them better.”

Finding a strong, consistent wireless Internet connection on campus can be harder than finding a seat in The Lot at noon, but USC’s Information Technology Services hopes to solve that problem by increasing the number of wireless access points across campus within the next year.
Making connections · Finding a wireless Internet connection on campus can be difficult, but USC ITS is hoping to remedy the problem. - Photo illustration by Vicki Yang 
ITS announced this week that the wireless Internet availability at both the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus will be drastically increased in coming months.
According to Kevin Durkin, director of communications and marketing for ITS, USC is working to ensure every academic building on both campuses has access to wireless Internet.
“We recognize that most of our users rely on the wireless network more than the wired network, and we’re trying to respond to that,” Durkin said.
Over the past decade, the need for wireless Internet on campus has increased dramatically, according to Durkin. In 2002, ITS maintained 214 wireless points on campus. Now, that number is up to 1,578 — a 125 percent increase in coverage over the last three years alone.
Despite this increase in coverage, an annual ITS customer survey that measures feedback from a random selection of students and faculty on campus showed a continuously growing demand for reliable wireless Internet coverage.
“Wireless on the campuses has been the key point of dissatisfaction,” Durkin said.
In response to student and faculty concerns, ITS is now looking for a new vendor for the university’s wireless infrastructure and to add more wireless access points.
“It’s going to be pervasive coverage,” Durkin said. “It’s going to cover both campuses, and we believe the access itself will also be improved.”
This is good news for students who often use, or attempt to use, the USC wireless network on campus.
“They should fix it because it gets really weak,” said Manaal Jafrey, a junior majoring in business administration. “Even right now it can’t connect.”
Jafrey said she often uses the on-campus wireless in and near Leavey Library and the Marshall School of Business without problems, but she has run into problems in other areas.
Saira Zia, a senior majoring in communication, said she has been very disappointed with the poor wireless coverage near another major library on campus.
“Mine is really weak around the Doheny area,” Zia said. “It should work there.”
Durkin encourages students to visit the ITS website, which specifically pinpoints all of the campus’s wireless access points, including floor-by-floor and room-by-room coverage.
“What students can do is look at the map and check out which rooms have coverage,” Durkin said. “We want this to be something that makes [students] more self-sufficient.”
ITS could not comment on how much the overhaul will cost because it is still in the process of evaluating vendors to see which is a good fit for the university.
Though specific buildings are not yet targeted, Durkin said there will be overall increased wireless coverage throughout the entire campus, including dorms, residence halls and even some off-campus spots.
Durkin maintained, however, that ITS is not in charge of wireless service off campus, so not all off-campus university housing students are guaranteed wireless Internet.
“We’re working on it, so stay tuned,” he said.

As the news spread that President Steven B. Sample would be the 2010 commencement speaker, some seniors grumbled they weren’t getting an outside speaker as past classes have. But now, other seniors are banding together in support of Sample.
“I don’t understand why everyone is so upset,” said Brian Tenenbaum, a senior majoring in international relations.
In reaction to the Facebook group “Class of 2010 — Let’s get a Real Commencement Speaker,”  started by Will Sohigian, a senior majoring in sociology and Spanish, Tenenbaum began the “I am Proud Steven Sample is my Commencement Speaker”  Facebook group.
Tenenbaum said he can see the reason for students’ frustration but does not think it is warranted.
“Students [probably] got used to big names coming to campus,” he said.
Tenenbaum said he’s heard Sample speak before and was confident the university made a smart decision.
“He used to do a lot of orientation speeches, so he was one of the first speakers I saw when coming here. To have him as the last one would be great,” he said.
Sohigian said he created the group against having Sample as a speaker because he feels the class deserves a commencement speaker from outside the university.
“We’ve been having [President Sample] speak for several years now,” he said. “We’re only going to be graduating one time.”
Other seniors echoed this sentiment.
“I feel sort of cheated because he speaks at every commencement,” said Brian Hunt, a senior majoring in communication. “It’s usually someone fun and entertaining but nevertheless someone with an interesting perspective and someone who can relay that in a speech.”
Senior Vice President of University Relations Martha Harris said Sample was chosen because of the significance of this time in USC’s history.
“Typically, the president seeks ideas about the commencement speaker at the beginning of the year,” Harris said. “But the cabinet felt this year was a really historic moment at the university.”
Harris said she could understand students’ feelings but thought the sentiment of those against Sample was a little misguided.
“This is a kind of thing students will appreciate later as alumni, when they see the giant leap [the university] took,” Harris said.
Many faculty members agree and say they think Sample is as good a choice as previous USC speakers like California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger or notable journalist Ted Koppel.
“It’s a great choice. It’s his last commencement,” said Michael B. Preston, professor of political science. “Presiding over the ceremony is different than speaking.”
Though some have strong opinions, Hunt noted that he thinks the majority is ambivalent toward the graduation speaker and is just looking forward to the general event.
“The speech will speak for itself,” Hunt said. “Most don’t care who it is.”
It looks like something that DT wrote to kind of calm down resentment against the speaker this year. definitely not buying the article where they say that students banded together or what not.
By the way, that FB group ,”I am Proud Steven Sample is my Commencement Speaker” only has 10 members. as opposed to “Class of 2010 — Let’s get a Real Commencement Speaker,” which has over 370 members. 
nice job.
Also worth noting is that the group against Sample as commencement speaker has around 350 members, whereas the one in favor of Sample as commencement speaker has 9.  Keep that in mind.  This article does not mention that.
For all of USC’s bragging about becoming a top school, the pride, (and well warranted), the excitement, how it is now more difficult to get into than ever, more applicants than ever, competing with big name schools and now top on lists, etc etc etc..and ‘global’, expanding, more international students, study abroad, etc. etc. etc., the choice of Sample as speaker for commencement is such a contradiction to that, it just seems so ’small town’ and ‘insular’ for where this school is now….yes, he is partly responsible for that, but have a special DAY to honor him, have a special WEEK for him, with tributes in his honor to give HIM the send off HE deserves..but commencement is for THE STUDENTS… no one is saying he has not done an amazing job and just about everyone recognizes that..so honor him at commencement, but not have him as the guest speaker, when most have heard him speak many times over at school through the years. And he is a wonderful speaker.. but this is the students day. If USC is indeed up there with the other famous world renown schools then why not have guest speakers on the level those schools have? Not just some ‘celeb’, but someone OUT THERE in the WORLD, outside of the school, who has accomplished things BEYOND USC, since the hope is that our graduates will have many accomplishments BEYOND USC..I think Sample has done an amazing job. I also think he should recognize this as a once in a lifetime event for the grads, and should have been a big man, and been willing to step aside and give them the send off they deserve. Or all the bragging, all the notices sent to homes and e-mails regarding how great USC has become, pale, if the class graduating, at what seems to be the height of that rise, can’t have a world renown speaker of note on their commencement day, as other top schools have. . It seems that everything at USC has GROWN, except in this area. This area has now, this year, gotten SMALLER…If there was a committee in charge of seeking out and booking a speaker for this special day they should all be replaced, as this was not only a huge oversight, a big mistake of judgment, but seems to be laziness, taking the low road, in the extreme. Or was it University POLITICS, which would be very sad as it is the graduates who suffer …The students have been encouraged to ‘go for it’ to think big, think global, expand themselves in their years at USC, just as the school has done.. and then they get the easiest choice to speak at their graduation…and the grads, who have worked so hard, and have been so committed to, and proud of, the greatness of their school, deserve better on THEIR very special day..not the President’s day, not the Alums day, not the UNIVERSITY POWERS THAT BE day, but THEIR day.
A little thin…

Students aren’t the only ones lost in the maze of grading policies across the university.
The Center for Excellence in Teaching held a town hall on grading Wednesday, giving faculty, teaching assistants and students a chance to discuss current grading policies and potential changes to the process. About 30 people — mostly faculty members — attended the event to voice concerns about how their colleagues administer grades and to discuss the possibility of creating a universal grading process for USC classes.
CET Director J. Lawford Anderson said the center’s undergraduate fellows had become concerned about grading misconceptions and led the planning effort for Wednesday’s town hall.
Steven Lamy, vice dean for academic programs, said recent studies show more students complain about grades every year.
Though federal law bans faculty from discussing grades with parents, Lamy said the proliferation of “helicopter parents” — those who swoop in to defend their children — has been one cause for the escalation.
“You’re going to be the first one to give them a grade lower than an A-minus, and they’ll complain,” Lamy said.
He also expressed concern that faculty members are becoming less involved in grading.
“That’s not the model we want,” Lamy said. “Faculty have sovereignty with grades.”
Steve Finkel, an associate professor of biological sciences who led the discussion, said professors hate grades.
“From the student perspective, you might want it one size fits all, but some things are quantitative and others qualitative,” he said. “There’s this conflict between being fair and being consistent.”
Two professors raised a concern about quotas, saying they’ve heard department heads in some schools have set quotas that limit the number of students who get A’s.
“The idea behind it is to ensure uniformity in the grading system because there was one class in two sections taught by two people and everyone wanted to take the professor that gave out a lot of A’s and B’s — the easy one,” one professor said.
Lamy said professors are required to post their syllabi, including the basis for class grades, before the start of a semester. Although there are no public records of quota policies, he said individual professors appear to follow the practice of rationing the number of students who receive specific letter grades.
The registrar’s office calculates how “easy” or “hard” a professor grades by dividing the average GPA of a class by the average overall GPA’s of the students in the class. Lamy said more department heads need to examine this data and talk with professors whose ratings are not a perfect 1.0.
Lamy also responded to concerns about too many midterms in one class by citing a Harvard study that shows students learn best if they have frequent opportunities to be graded.
“The more we can encourage faculty of developing more ways to evaluate students, the better,” he said.
Jeanine Yutani, a T.A. and a CET graduate fellow, said students are frustrated by unrealistic tests.
“They ask, ‘You’re telling me 85 percent of what you are asking me I won’t know, then why are you asking me?’” she said.
One writing professor said he thinks students should be able to calculate grades as easily as the professor. He said departments should examine how they compare to other departments and then communicate their findings publicly, so engineering students will know their GPAs will look different than people in other disciplines.
Other issues raised were the exponential rise in academic dishonesty, the need for clearer and more transparent definition of rules for assessing attendance and appealing grades, and better notification about their mid-semester grades.
After Wednesday’s discussion, Finkel said he will try to develop the best university-wide practices for grading that would still allow departments and faculty to exercise final control.
Supposedly, you have been terribly misinformed. Harvard doesn’t give out 4.0’s to every student; it happens maybe once a decade.
Supposedly, Harvard gives every one of its students a 4.0, regardless of whether they deserved it or not. Why can’t USC do the same?

Students who thought they were getting a free lunch at The Lot on Wednesday were disappointed to find out their “Student Appreciation Day” coupons were merely a part of the Skull & Dagger Society’s annual prank.
Pushing buttons · The Skull & Dagger Society stacked microwaves to form a tribute to President Steven B. Sample, who played a role in developing the microwave touchpad. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
Skull & Dagger, a semi-secret honor society for graduating seniors, is known for its annual hoaxes. Last year, the group pretended there was a contagious disease spreading through campus and walked around in hazmat suits handing out warning notices.
This year, the Skull & Dagger prank was two-fold.
First, members of Skull & Dagger handed out coupons for free food at The Lot, telling students it was part of a fictional “Student Appreciation Day.”
The hoax, however, did not go over well with students or administrators from USC Hospitality.
“Most students are not confused — some are just upset there’s not free food,” said Marc Isaac, a manager at The Lot.
Isaac said The Lot employees were notified of the hoax when a construction worker came into The Lot early Wednesday morning with one of the coupons. Management immediately created signs declaring the coupons invalid, which Isaac said stopped most of the confusion around the prank.
“It’s hindering to our business; [it’s] immature,” Isaac said. “If we didn’t find out about it early in the morning, we would have had lines out the door.”
Though USC Hospitality does offer certain discounts for its eateries, it never offers coupons like those that were part of Skull & Dagger’s prank, said Kris Klinger, director of USC Hospitality.
“It negatively impacted service and the overall feel of The Lot,” Klinger said.
Jin Mitchem, a sophomore majoring in public policy, management and planning, said he found The Lot hoax more harmful than amusing.
“It’s just mean,” Mitchem said. “If it were on April 1, it would be funny, but this is just random.”
The second part of the society’s prank was a stack of microwaves stationed right in front of Tommy Trojan. Next to the microwaves, a sign declared the appliances a tribute to President Steven B. Sample.
The sight of microwaves in the center of campus perplexed many students, such as Joanne Chong, an undecided freshman.
“It’s definitely some kind of statement; I don’t know if it’s funny,” Chong said. “Maybe it’s some sort of environmental statement.”
Nick Hamada, a senior majoring in international relations and a member of Skull & Dagger, said the group gathered the microwaves from a local junkyard to construct a tribute to Sample, who helped invent technology critical to the microwave touchpad.
“The microwaves are a tribute to Sample,” Hamada said. “He invented the touchpad on the microwave … or something electronic in it … and we want to honor him for it.”
Grace Wong contributed to this report.
This “honor” society is not very bright or clever if all they could deliver is a fake coupon and a pile of microwave ovens.  Next year, please contact Yale students for some original ideas.
I think this is hilarious, long lines at the lot? wasnt that the intention of skull and daggers prank?. The best part is the stupid hospitality people actually gave out free food! ha, great job skull and dagger!
I think it was a pretty clever prank… after all the senior class in particular has been through with construction and not having a campus center, good for them for getting a little revenge on hospitality and the administration!
Love it!

LOL, Skull and Dagger, what a useless group.  All they do is some bullsh!t prank each year.  Never done anything productive, LOL.  Waste of time.
how do you join the secret society?

The University Park Health Center plans to crack down on the recreational use of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medications around campus, but students say the new policies won’t stop them from accessing and using drugs like Adderall.
Effective May 1, the UPHC will institute policies that require a more thorough medical and mental examination of students seeking ADHD medication.
The policies are aimed at streamlining the process of prescribing these medications and preventing their use for non-medical purposes. Some students use ADHD medications to increase their focus as they prepare for tests or other difficult assignments.
“If students are seeking medications, they have to follow certain protocol,” said Dr. Ilene Rosenstein, director of student counseling services at the UPHC. “It’s really tightening up who gets the medication.”
Students who seek a prescription for ADHD medications, including Adderall, will need to have written documentation of their medical need from someone who has diagnosed the student. Students who haven’t been diagnosed with ADHD or a similar condition will need to go to the counseling center, which now has an extensive process for determining need.
Rosenstein said the purpose of the new policies is to properly diagnose students because some who come to the health center don’t actually need medication and some who need medication aren’t always diagnosed correctly.
The UPHC is also concerned with the illegal use of ADHD medication, particularly Adderall, by students who believe the drug will help them enhance their performance in school.
“We don’t want to be giving out drugs to people who don’t have the need,” Rosenstein said.
Although there is no way of tracking illegal use of Adderall on campus, Rosenstein said more thorough examinations by the UPHC and the counseling center might decrease illegal use of the drug.
“We’re doing thorough assessments — we may even call family, ADHD is not something that [just] occurs later on in life,” she said.
Students, however, believe the illegal Adderall use on campus will continue despite any changes at the UPHC.
Albert Sung, a sophomore majoring in biology, said he has noticed many students receive their Adderall from off-campus sources to circumvent UPHC policies.
“People are too afraid to try and go to the health center for Adderall, since it’s definitely an illegal use,” said Sung, who noted he doesn’t use Adderall. “It’s just easier to get it from other places, so these new policies won’t really affect the supply of under-the-table Adderall at USC.”
A student who wished to remain anonymous said he gains access to Adderall through those who actually have a legitimate need for ADHD medication. He said that at his fraternity, many students who have ADHD give their medication to other members who need help studying.
“Since most people who give out Adderall are the ones who actually have ADHD, I don’t see how this [policy] will help,” he said. “Students who need it will get it. The school can’t control what people do once they’re diagnosed and have filled out a prescription.”

It always seems the Internet is under attack. Every week some fresh outrage breaks out over something that has appeared online. Sometimes it’s a morality issue stemming from some indecent website or video.
This time the website in question is WikiLeaks.org. The site recently leaked footage from 2007 that shows an attack by American helicopters on a group of Iraqis that killed two Reuters reporters and a handful of civilians.
WikiLeaks came under fire immediately for the video and was forced to contend with accusations of impeding a military investigation, leaking sensitive government material and showing a complete lack of civic responsibility by posting the video. Some have called the site a collection of hearsay and unchecked facts.
However, all of these critics are missing the point of WikiLeaks: it is a brilliant new take on political activism.
Internet activism is nothing new, but it has sadly been shortchanged and underestimated. When it comes to Internet activism, most people simply think of donating money to political candidates’ campaign websites, best typified by the drive for online fundraising that helped finance Barack Obama’s successful bid for the presidency in 2008. However, there is much more to it then that.
The Internet is essentially the ultimate hybrid of communication technology and information storing. All it takes is an Internet connection to share documents instantly, send mass e-mails across the globe and network in ways that regular activists cannot.
The Internet has fostered the evolution of activism in many forms — there are now online flash mobs set up to protest human rights violations in China, and global petitions that sympathizers can sign electronically to help stop the spread of AIDS in Africa. Some even take more radical approaches, like flooding a disliked company’s website to crash the servers in protest.
Internet activism has evolved alongside social networking. As more people are able to interact with one another, they can share more information over a greater area and at a faster rate. They just need a central hub to compile this information so that they can link to it: That’s where WikiLeaks comes in.
Despite its name, the site has nothing to do with Wikipedia — the prefix wiki simply means a collaborative website. According to the site, WikiLeaks was founded by “Chinese dissidents, journalists, mathematicians and start-up company technologists” from around the world.
The site hosts suppressed documents as well as classified reports from governments and organizations. Many of these reports, like the recent video from Iraq, describe suspicious activities or abuses on the part of these groups. The goal is not to slander any group unjustly but to expose the world to the surreptitious activity of high-profile organizations and governments.
With no central figure, the site relies on a board of advisers and a series of experts to vet all submitted intelligence for authenticity and accuracy. The primarily volunteer-run servers of the site are located in Sweden, where the law defends Internet anonymity.
Since its launch in 2007, the site has not only exposed corruption in countries like Kenya but also used its resources and viral skills to defend journalists who face imprisonment for their stories. If that isn’t activism at its finest, then what is?
It is important to note that WikiLeaks is not itself the source of the leaked information. Government sources provide the video, so any claims to arrest or charge WikiLeak contributors with espionage don’t hold water. If people feel the need to press charges, they will have to find those responsible for the leaks.
In many ways, the controversy surrounding WikiLeaks is essentially a digital-age update of the Pentagon Papers scandal. In 1971, former military analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked a classified report on unpublicized American acts in Vietnam and Cambodia to The New York Times. This led to lawsuits against Ellsberg and The New York Times, and ultimately the Times’ actions were ruled legal by the Supreme Court.
Going by that approach, WikiLeaks’ actions, no matter how radical, are simply legal forms of political activism and information dissemination. It is publicizing intelligence to expose corruption and abuse of power. It is simply doing what the media is expected to do: provide a check to the power of government. And in that case, it is succeeding.
The media serves to hold the government and other organizations accountable for their actions. In recent years, however, the traditional media has faltered in that approach, watering down its exposés and reports for fear of reprisal. WikiLeaks does not do this. It posts the full documents, unedited, and with full impact.
Should people hack government accounts and steal classified documents from organizations? No. But if someone on the inside leaks a sensitive report, what is wrong with there being a site that collects and showcases that report?
The press is one of the greatest checks on government corruption and abuse of power, and the Internet is finally stepping up to help. WikiLeaks is not some evil site trying to undermine civilization, but a great tool for political activism. And isn’t that what the Internet needs?

(703) Just woke up wearing a top hat and simpsons boxers. i also found more money in my wallet then what i had before going out, about $1000 more.
Lolz · Textsfromlastnight.com founders Lauren Leto (left) and Ben Bator spoke on-campus about their experiences running the site, which showcases hilarious text messages out of their original context. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
(401) This is a mass text. Does anyone know where I am?
(440) The ticket read “Found nude in a tree.”
If you’ve encountered similar phrases from a Facebook news feed or status and suffered complete confusion, this article attempts to clear your clouded state of mind.
If you erupted in a fit of laughter at these messages and their recognizable format, you are not alone.
For those who sent these text messages without any awareness of doing so, perhaps they aren’t so funny, but for the friend who received them and for the thousands of visitors of textsfromlastnight.com, they are hilarious.
Texts From Last Night allows people from across the nation to submit texts they received detailing wild, illogical nights. The result? A list of anonymous texts that give funny and sometimes shocking snippets of nighttime experiences.
The website lists only the area code of the sender (the numbers in parentheses before each message) and allows readers to rate the text as good or bad and reply to the message.
The idea started when Michigan State University alumni and friends Ben Bator and Lauren Leto frequently forwarded one another humorous texts from friends who experienced outrageous nights. Bator and Leto decided to start a website to catalogue these comedic messages.
And on Tuesday night, USC Program Board invited the entrepreneurial duo to host a discussion of its Internet sensation.
“It was really simple at first,” Bator said. “As simple as [creating] another blog on Blogspot.”
After making posts on a blog for several months, the duo decided it wanted a full-fledged website. A friend was enlisted to write some coding, and Texts From Last Night was born.
“It just took off,” Bator said.
Before the popularity it boasts today, Bator and Leto attempted to garner attention for their website through social networking sites Twitter and Facebook. They sent links to all their Facebook friends and, within a week, the website received a million page views.
With such instant popularity, the website expanded to other mediums.
“I was sitting outside one day at my friend’s house and we got seven e-mails in rapid succession from book agents,” Bator said.
“I met 12 different publishers to talk about our idea,” Leto added.
Within a year of the website’s early 2009 launch, the book Texts From Last Night: All the Texts No One Remembers Sending hit shelves. It includes some of the texts found on the website, as well as others that remain unposted.
Leto and Bator saved a section of the book to include their favorites, but Leto had to stop herself from including what Texts From Last Night followers call the “Simba” text.
The message received an impressive 504 replies and 64,940 votes for a “good” night. However, the content of the message remains too scandalous to discuss.
“I could not put it as one of my favorites because my parents would see it,” Leto said.
The pair stressed that it logs all the submissions it receives and plans to make use of them by either sharing them on the website or keeping them archived in case of another book release.
When it came to generating ad revenue for their site, Bator and Leto decided not to resort to the  teeth-whitening and weight loss hooks found on many websites.
Instead, they joined forces with indieclick.com, which describes itself as a company that “represents unique audiences on important online destinations.”
When visiting Texts From Last Night, you encounter the catchy advertisements of American Apparel, a special offer from Del Taco and an entreaty to watch Lady Gaga’s new music video.
Indeed, the creators seem to have a knack for keeping up with pop culture. Along with a Blackberry application, the website now has iPad and iPhone applications and will soon have one for Droid owners.
Not only have Bator and Leto managed to create a highly visited, often-quoted website, a paperback book and various cell phone applications, they have also landed a deal with Happy Madison Productions, founded by comedian Adam Sandler.
The company is in the process of creating a sitcom television show that will follow a group of partying friends and use material from the website.
Despite their clear vision and large following, Bator and Leto stress that anyone slightly squeamish or conservative should not visit the website.
Some readers may find themselves in disbelief at the strange situations people find themselves in.
With such a high volume of submissions — more than 15,000 per day — visitors to the website expressed doubt about the honesty of the messages.
He also said that it’s obvious when someone sends in a message that they “worked on.” Furthermore, the texts serve only as small glimpses of a night’s incidents.
“You can’t really say whether it’s fake or real out of context,” Bator said.
The website’s immense popularity showcases certain characteristics of society today.
Because most of the site’s content is scandalous, it conveys our need to share these debauched moments with others. Instead of cataloguing these memories of sexuality, drugs and craziness only in the minds of those involved, the website is a modern repository for all manner of forbidden tales.
And although there is a certain negativity in laughing at the illogical, potentially dangerous actions of others, Texts From Last Night has its benefits.
Site visitors can learn from others’ mistakes, and senders of the text messages can realize how they act when under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Either way, Leto and Bator have cleverly taken advantage of the human tendency to analyze others’ actions.
Their website follows in the footsteps of such pre-blog television programs as America’s Funniest Home Videos, which seeks to entertain audiences with the spontaneous — and sometimes painful — adventures of complete strangers.
“We’re not out here to ruin people’s lives,” Leto said. “We don’t even include [senders’] last initial.”
Fans of Texts From Last Night can now purchase the book online and even order T-shirts silkscreened with the words of text messages posted on the site.
With the popularity of their website on the rise and sponsored parties taking place all over the country, it seems the creators will continue to keep people laughing.

Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival began as a daylong artistic outpouring in a geriatric desert hub but has since evolved into a three-day commercial machine capable of selling out its 60,000 capacity venue. Because of its proximity to Los Angeles and day pass sales, the Goldenvoice-organized event has always had a commuter appeal where even broke Southern Californians can spend a day waiting for Rage Against the Machine to play.
But this year’s ticketing structure changed and the presale of single-day passes has been discontinued, forcing attendees to be trapped in the Coachella Valley for three full days. And for those who haven’t yet braved the campsites and overstuffed hotels surrounding the Empire Polo Field this time of year, it can get pretty miserable. Without the luxury of being able to bail out after your favorite band plays the first day, the message has been sent to potential attendees that Coachella is not just a concert — it’s an experience.
Pack accordingly.
The basics
Baby wipes: Even if you’ve never changed a diaper in your life, baby wipes are essential travel items. Use them to remove layers of dirt and sweat from your Coachella-covered bodies at the end of the day and bring a travel-size pack for the crucial midday brow wipes.
Deodorant: Bring it and apply liberally. As anyone who has been to any music festival (or any sold-out concert, for that matter) knows, the smell of other people’s body odor is not a pleasant one. It’s impossible for everyone not to reek come Sunday night, but preventative measures are always appreciated.
Sunblock: You’re going to the desert where the average high will be 90 degrees. For those who don’t want to be peeling away the top two layers of their skin in the coming weeks, this one should be obvious.
Water: While water isn’t allowed inside the event, your posse should have some stock at base camp at all times. Even if it ends up tasting like lukewarm bathwater after boiling in the sun all day, your body will thank you for the hydration.
Sleeping bag/pillow/blankets: Taking advantage of the few hours of sleep per night is crucial to getting your body through the weekend. If you are not in the possession of a hotel room reservation, ensure your nighttime comfort and B.Y.O.B. (Bring Your Own Bed). Your back will thank you later.
Ticket: In the chaos of blanket-packing, it’s easy to lose sight of the important things in life — like proof of payment.
For the car
iPod: In addition to the two-hour drives to Indio, Calif., and back, you should plan to spend hours idling in Coachella traffic. The parking situation at the venue is notoriously messy and it’s been known to take hours just to get back to the main road at the end of the night. Update your iPod with all the latest songs and bump them with pride as you sit stagnant with other carpoolers. Try to refrain from listening to the bands you’re going to see perform — it ruins the live experience.
Travel games: If you’ve never seen a miniature Scrabble board, you’re missing out on some adorably tiny wordplay. Not only are travel versions of popular board games available at any mass market retail store (Target has a great selection), but the novelty of petite-sized Sorry pieces will easily get you through the interminable car rides.
Ice chest: Find a compact ice chest and load it up with ice, water and snacks before you leave the house. Why rely on fast food and truck stops for sustenance when you can just crawl into the hatchback and save the time?
For the show
Camera: Anything without a removeable lens is good to go inside the Empire Polo Field. No guarantees your near-stage vantage points will be anything worth remembering, but bring your point-and-shoot and snap away.
Walkie talkies: You’re going to get separated from your group at some point during the weekend. And don’t rely on cell phones to keep you in touch with your pals. Service towers get overloaded at large-scale music festivals and without a set of long-range walkie talkies, your “Meet me at the Mojave stage” text might not get sent until well after Beach House finishes.
Camping urine holder: Yes, it sounds gross, but the average urine output for an adult is 1.5 liters a day and the average wait time for a Coachella porta-potty is 1.5 hours. When nature calls and you have a good spot in the Muse pit, you’ll be glad you got over the nasty factor.
Don’t even think about bringing…
Drums: In an unconscious effort to not become Burning Man, drums are once again not permitted inside Coachella. All Venice Beach escapees are forced to save the jam circles for the midnight bonfire.
Kentucky Derby hats: While the craft that goes into the horse racing event’s oversized cranium accessories are very much appreciated, they are not proper concert attire. Wide-brimmed floppy hats are great for blocking out the sun, but they are also great for blocking out the view of the stage for everyone around you.
Alcohol: Though being intoxicated is ingrained social protocol for music festivals, booze is the worst place to start. The sugars in alcohol act as a diuretic, encouraging the body to dispel more water than it normally would and making the multitude of on-site beer gardens the bane of overheated Coachella-goers.
Energy drinks: If you need to keep your exhausted body upright through the Gorillaz set Sunday, Red Bulls will not be of service. Energy drinks are bad for hanging out in the desert for the the same dehydrating reason as alcohol, so try and rack up the R.E.M. sleep instead.

If you’ve already picked up a case of water bottles and thrown that gallon tube of sunscreen in your backpack, chances are you’ve also done your listening homework for this year’s Coachella music festival.
Or have you?
This year’s lineup comes stacked with indie acts, many from outside the United States, and a few mainstream names. While the thought of Devo’s digital-whip slashes, the piano chords of Grizzly Bear’s “Two Weeks” or the live rendition of Phoenix’s “Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix” may have you salivating, here are five acts with smaller American fan bases, but the thunder of a thousand Thom Yorkes.
Miike Snow
Even if you’ve heard the opening chords of “Animal” enough times to fill an echo chamber, the Stockholm-based trio is currently poised for one of Sunday’s most compelling sets.
Fronted by American songwriter and guitarist Andrew Wyatt and provided with heartfelt, icy textures by Swedish producers Bloodshy and Avant, Miike Snow’s enchanting, undeniably catchy material wields the power of any Neil Young ballad.
“Silvia,” “Black and Blue,” and the Adam Lambert-approved “Plastic Jungle” are wonderful examples and will hopefully make the band’s set list.
The festival weather has been known to soar into the 100s, but with these guys on hand, many shivers will be felt.
Jónsi
After several long years of rest and occasional producing gigs, the cherub-voiced Sigur Ros front man will return to the desert with a new solo album and a rabid fan base.
Sung mostly in English (a considerable break from Jónsi’s self-invented “Hopelandic” tongue) and chirping with raw, unfiltered strings, acoustic guitars and woodwinds, his songs feel like the lost soundtrack to a post-1945 Scandinavian folklore epic.
“Boy Lilikoi” and “Go Do,” the latter featuring a suitcase among other percussion instruments, will most surely get childhood memories flowing, hearts soaring and tear ducts raging.
Jónsi’s Coachella stop is among the first on a summer tour for the artist, so unless you’re planning a trip to Copenhagen, catch him now.
Fever Ray
Sweden’s Karin Dreijer Andersson, one half of The Knife and arguably the creepiest indie vocalist since Genesis P-Orridge, will be performing songs from her rapturous new solo album, made under the alias “Fever Ray,” on Friday.
Lush with throbbing, cinematic soundscapes of synths, strings, tribal percussion and even water glasses, Andersson’s haunting sounds are terrifying, blissful, unquestionably hypnotic and perfectly suited to the blackest of desert nights.
“If I Had a Heart” and “Dry and Dust” are both fine places to begin one’s pre-listening journey. Just don’t show up to the festival expecting to hear “Heartbeats.”
Proxy
Ever wonder what a rave in a boiler room might be like? If so, be sure to check out Proxy’s set in the Sahara Tent (and fill those water bottles beforehand).
Though the young Russian producer has been remixing tracks by artists like Digitalism and Peaches for the last few years, his more recent solo work has endowed him with a reputation for fuzz-filled, ear-shattering, sweat-soaked dance parties.
“Dance in Dark” and “Destroy” have been the staples of world famous D.J.s since their releases. In the hands of their creator, they will likely bring down the house.
If his Berlin basement show I caught in October is any measure to go by, Proxy will eat Deadmau5 alive come Friday night.
Plastikman
If Sly Stone doesn’t show up, then Plastikman may go down as the most impressive addition to this year’s electronic-rich Coachella lineup. Well before Daft Punk or The Chemical Brothers started playing with samplers, the Detroit-raised Hawtin was well into creating some of the finest minimalist techno to ever blow out club PA systems. Dark, heavy on the bass and featuring anything from the battering of helicopter blades to the clicking of pens, Plastikman’s music might seem more challenging than an Andrei Tarkovsky picture, but amplified at deafening levels and complimented with surrealist imagery and light shows, it’s a purely alien experience. For a more visceral taste of his Sunday set, secure the loudest speakers your landlord will allow, rev up “Headcase” or “Spastik,” and turn off all the lights.

With the arrival of spring practice, a new coach, and a highly touted recruiting class, anticipation is building for next season’s Trojan football team.
After a disappointing 2009 campaign, Trojan fans hope the team can return to its Pac-10 championship-winning ways.  As has been the case since his departure in 2005, anticipation has been building as the team looks for the next Reggie Bush.
For the last three seasons, this pressure mostly fell on Joe McKnight’s shoulders.  McKnight was productive but fumble prone in his three seasons at SC, and he never became the game changing force everyone predicted upon his arrival.
With McKnight gone, Trojans fans appear to have bestowed the “Next Reggie Bush” title on freshman running back Dillon Baxter.
Baxter made headlines with a fifty yard run in a scrimmage during saturday’s practice that coach Lane Kiffin described as “like Reggie Bush’s against Fresno State in 2005.”  Baxter took a simple handoff left and turned it into gold, making five tacklers miss on the way to the end zone, including one defender who missed twice.
The video of the play has already gotten 1,317,000 plus views in less than a week, which only serves to increase the hype.  Baxter made more headlines when Kiffin explored the Wildcat offense with him at quarterback this week.
Baxter was the starting quarterback at Mission Bay high school in San Diego; a hometown which, as many writers have noted, he also shares with Bush and Marcus Allen, two Hiesman-winning running backs at USC.  While Baxter may become the next Bush, the next McKnight or the next five star bust, none can say for sure, but highlights like that one will certainly make it enjoyable to watch.

The website for the Mt. San Antonio College Relays, more commonly known as the Mt. Sac Relays, proclaims the meet to be “where the world’s best athletes compete!”
Jumps · Junior hurdler Brendan Ames shares USC’s best time in the 110-meter hurdler with junior Oscar Spurlock at 13.81 seconds. Ames and Spurlock will be tested this weekend against some of the nation’s best. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
The USC track and field team will need to be at its best from April 15 to 17 in Walnut, Calif., if it wants to justify its current  No. 7 ranking and have a strong showing against those athletes.
“This meet will give us a much better idea of where we stand, especially within the conference,” USC coach Ron Allice said. “The competition was very stiff just to qualify [for the Mt. Sac Relays]. Not everyone that we wanted to get in got in.”
For the athletes who qualified, the meet will give them the opportunity to both improve their qualifying times for the championship season and improve against some of the stiffest competition the Trojans have faced all year.
“Generally speaking, we’re going to put people in their best event,” Allice said. “We’re trying to give people the best chances to post their best time for later this year.”
The Mt. Sac website isn’t being hyperbolic when it uses the phrase “world’s best athletes.” With U.S. collegiate powerhouses like Stanford, Baylor and Washington, USC will run, throw and hurdle against athletes from Bermuda, Great Britain, Canada, Finland and a myriad of other nations eager to show what they can do on the American stage.
“You wouldn’t be at USC if you didn’t think you could compete at that level with athletes from around the globe,” Allice said. “That’s what we try to do. We try to put our athletes in a position where they can compete against the best, no matter where they’re from.”
USC currently has 57 men and women scheduled to compete at Mt. Sac, including some of its most impressive athletes.
Senior Ahmad Rashad, generally considered to be USC’s best short-distance runner, will run both the 100-meter and 200-meter dash after a couple weeks without competition.
Junior hurdlers Oscar Spurlock and Brendan Ames, who both have best times of 13.81 in the men’s 110-meter high hurdles, ranked ninth in the nation, will both compete in the event this weekend.
Sophomore Dalilah Muhammad, who last weekend won the women’s high jump at the Pomona-Pitzer Invitational, will return to the 400-meter hurdles for the USC women, the event in which she set the nation’s fastest time this year at the Trojan Invitational back in March.
Junior Zsofia Erdelyi, originally from Godollo, Hungary, will compete in the women’s 5,000-meter run at a meet in which her home country is represented in the women’s hammer throw.
Once all the results are in, Allice said the next objective is to use the times to determine strategy for the USC-UCLA dual meet on May 1.
“Our performances will determine how we line [the dual meet] up,” Allice said. “It’s key that we do well this weekend for the sake of the rest of the year.”

Former USC running back Reggie Bush has been ordered to give a deposition April 23 in regard to a lawsuit filed against him in the ongoing investigation of whether or not he received inappropriate funds and gifts.
Push · Former Trojan Reggie Bush was drafted in 2006, but controversy from his days at USC has followed him as a professional ever since. - Photo courtesy of Joel Zink 
San Diego-based sports marketer Lloyd Lake has filed suit in San Diego County Superior Court looking to recoup nearly $300,000 in gifts and cash that Lake and his marketing firm allegedly provided to Bush and his family during his time at USC.
Bush was ordered by Judge Steven R. Denton to provide his out-of-court testimony for the case in order to determine if Bush needs to repay Lake’s company New Era Sports & Entertainment after he allegedly broke a marketing agreement Bush had with the firm.
If Bush did indeed receive funds from the firm, he would be in violation of NCAA regulations on agreements amateur and collegiate athletes can have with agents and marketing firms prior to their declaration for the NFL draft.
Michael Michaels, who along with Lake co-founded New Era Sports & Entertainment, was also ordered to give a deposition to the court. Michaels brought a similar suit against Bush three years ago and settled for a reported figure of $300,000.
Until this time, lawyers for Bush had attempted to prevent Michaels from giving a deposition on the matter because of the terms of the settlement agreement, but could not convince the court of the matter.
Michaels will be deposed     April 21.
Bush and his attorneys had filed a bid for a confidential arbitration on the matter in order to keep records of testimony and depositions out of public record, but lost their appeal.
Because the testimonies are now viewed as public record, the NCAA has requested the depositions of Michaels and Bush be submitted to the committee, which is currently investigating the USC as a whole.
University officials, including athletic department members, met with the NCAA infractions committee at the end of February as part of the NCAA’s investigation of infractions revolving around Bush and former USC basketball player O.J. Mayo.
USC and the NCAA had expected results of the investigation around mid-April, but the committee’s request for copies of the depositions signals that the investigation is ongoing.
The NCAA was unable to get a sworn statement from Michaels until this point because of the confidentiality agreement in his settlement with Bush, but it will now have access to his side of the story.
Bush’s deposition will be the first time he has answered questions under oath regarding Lake and Michaels’ accusations, which first came to light in 2006.
Lake alleges that Bush’s stepfather, LaMarr Griffin, came to him in 2004 with a plan to create a sports marketing agency with Bush as their most visible client. Lake then alleges that between 2004 and 2005, he supplied Griffin, Bush and his mother, Denise Griffin, with cash and gifts upwards of $290,000. Bush’s family also stayed in a Spring Valley, Calif., home owned by Michaels after the family ran into financial trouble. Other alleged gifts included a $13,000 1996 Chevrolet Impala.
After Bush won the Heisman trophy in 2005, his relationship with New Era allegedly fractured. An article in the OC Register stated that sources said, however, that Bush attempted to repair the relationship before he hired agent Joel Segal and Mike Ornstein as his marketing representative.

I have been writing this column every week for two and a half years, but the process feels more bizarre every time I pick up a copy of the paper.
I try to come up with similes to help rationalize what still seems foreign to me. Lately, column writing has begun to take on the appearance of the sports themselves.
The best columns and athletic achievements are products of preparation. The workload drains you of energy, but hopefully there’s an end worth the undertaking.
But like sports, the column’s result is often emphasized over the procedure. I try to pull back the curtains on the sporting world in my role as a columnist, so it’s only fair I now try to do the same to journalism and myself. Stick with me in this exercise of self-aggrandizement; I promise it will be worth it.
Above all, column writing is a weekly outlet for my neuroses. Even after I complete a piece, I can’t stop questioning myself. Did I overlook something in my assessment of USC football? What if I never fixed that comma splice? Does my columnist photo make my face look fat?
Filling this space every week is the hardest part of working at the Daily Trojan. If I have to recap a game or event, my only task is to get out of the way. But writing a column means stating an opinion I’m willing to be accountable for every week.
Sometimes I forget what I write will be read by others once I have completed it. Every journalist has a conflicted relationship at best with the comment section, but I love it. My favorite comment was a recommendation to drop out of school by a reader who apparently disagreed with what I had to say. Hey, I didn’t come this far not to go even further.
Comments and e-mail help ensure that what gets printed in the Daily Trojan doesn’t just become white noise on a page. Quality is obviously the top concern of any writer, but if people hate you, at least they’re reading you.
The sports section is unique in the sense that you occasionally receive feedback from players and coaches. I don’t have any stories of someone leaving a dead rat on the hood of my car or a coach wagging a finger in my face, Urban Meyer-style. But a lineman who eventually went on to the NFL called me out on something I wrote for the paper. This was also not a singular occurrence.
Writing sports columns, however, has given me an appreciation for the recipients of my critiques. The weekly task almost feels like a sporting event, except, you know, completely devoid of all physical hardship. But after so many stories, it becomes hard to bring the heat every week.
This problem is usually a matter of execution. Even the most prized concepts can fall flat, and these are the columns that hurt the most. Maybe some reference or analogy proved to be too flimsy to carry the piece.
In a sleep-deprived state, I once came up with an elaborate idea to explain how the 2008 USC football team was like Jay-Z’s 2001 album The Blueprint. Somehow, I was convinced I would need at least 1,000 words to explain this purported genius. The column thankfully never appeared, but maybe someday if I’m broke I’ll publish a book of lost columns in which I can flush out such a comparison.
The disconnect between preparation and execution is also the best explanation for most athletic shortcomings. You’ll never hear an athlete say, “We just didn’t take this game seriously.” But experiencing the phenomenon of seeing even the most promising set-ups fall short adds a layer of understanding.
Even triumphs of sports and prose are fleeting. I’ve written hundreds of articles during my time here; it would be a great achievement if I could remember a third of them. There’s also little room for nostalgia for athletes. You’re always on to the next one.
A writing mentor once told me that no two stories are alike. That means that from story to story, you’re either improving or slowing your progress.
I imagine this is what keeps great athletes going through the grind. It is what keeps me writing columns.

Mr. Middlehurst-Schwartz, I loved your column today.  What a wonderful look at “process”.

Ladies and gentlemen, students from all corners of campus: Trojan Grounds is starting a conspiracy.
Having just slaved over a paper, I walked into TroGro one fine morning looking for an orange juice fix. But instead of grabbing one of the innocent Starbucks cups at the front, I found myself confronted with a whole new array of sweets.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
Cupcakes, crème brûlée cups and a remarkable assortment of mini cheesecakes tempted me to forsake health and submit to sugary, fatty evil. Bleary eyed, I decided then and there that TroGro was trying to kill me.
Now that I’ve slept, I will admit that the new products probably aren’t part of a grand scheme; I’m sure TroGro is just responding to student demand. But that morning highlighted an issue with the convenience store.
The candy bars, baked goods and fatty frozen meals vastly overshadow the small selection of juices and healthy snacks — and as the latest additions show, they might continue to do so. Although TroGro caters to late-night cravings well, it should give students more than just what they want. By stocking healthier food, the store can provide students with what they need.
Contrary to popular opinion, healthy options are not impossible to come by. Several products already offered around campus could replace similar TroGro products. Take Stouffer’s frozen meals. Though the company’s slogan is “Let’s Fix Dinner,” it might as well be “Let’s Clog Your Arteries.” A serving of the macaroni & cheese contains 17 grams of fat, 30 milligrams of cholesterol and 920 milligrams of sodium .
By contrast, a serving of Amy’s Cheese Pizza Snacks, which students can find at The Lot, contains 7 grams of fat, 10 milligrams of cholesterol and 390 milligrams of sodium. They also have nutritional value, since the snacks contain whole grains and organic ingredients. Now, are the pizza bites the healthiest thing on the planet? No. But they are a vast improvement, one that USC Hospitality could conceivably make available.
There are a few more products USC Hospitality could replace. I’m sure the Pepperidge Farm fortress could size down a little to make room for whole grain crackers and dried fruit packets — and not the sugar-coated kind you find at the other end of the store.
Lärabars (also available at The Lot) could replace a few candy bars. These delicious treats contain nothing but fruits, nuts and cocoa, but they pack enough natural sugars to satisfy any sweet tooth. Moreover, while I’m not saying USC Hospitality should do away with all the croissants, it could afford to slip in some oatmeal cookies and banana loaves. I’m sure health-minded students would appreciate these options on mornings when the Cliff Bars are gone.
Of course, as business students know, product choice isn’t everything. TroGro doesn’t just stock junk food; it purposefully positions it so that we consume a lot. With the exception of the apples and oranges by the register, most of TroGro’s healthier options don’t exactly stand out — the energy bars sit under the gummy bears and licorice, the Odwalla juices are tucked into a corner near the back. It’s almost as if USC Hospitality would rather we impulsively grab sodas.
One could argue that TroGro has no reason to take health into consideration. After all, junk sells and it makes sense to supply the demand. But making money should not be TroGro’s only responsibility. USC Hospitality must not lose sight of the fact that the convenience store is located on a university campus — i.e., a center of learning.
A plethora of scientific evidence shows that consuming healthier foods increases our ability to learn. One study from across the pond demonstrates this finding to an alarming extent. British researchers gave supplements to 117 children with mild learning and behavioral disorders; some children received omega-3 oils, while some received plain olive oil.
After three months, researchers found that the children who had received the real supplements made up to 10 months’ worth of reading progress. Moreover, some of them even shed their disorders. Think you have attention deficit disorder? You might want to eat healthier. It’s too bad that TroGro won’t really help you if you’re pulling an all-nighter.
It’s true that TroGro can’t make us all health nuts. But if it can’t teach students to make good choices, it should at least make those choices readily available. In class, we learn about the body’s nutritional needs and America’s obesity problem. After arming us with the knowledge to take care of our bodies, why shouldn’t the university spread the tools? It makes absolutely no sense.
Students have repeatedly shown they enjoy healthy food. The Red Mango line at noon is huge, and the standard Red Mango cup is fat-free, fruity and completely delicious. If USC Hospitality used its resources to find quality health options instead of using them to scout for cupcakes, the convenience store’s profits would likely remain stable. For the sake of the students, it’s worth a try.
We’re college students — we don’t always know what’s best for us. What if TroGro, of all places, could point us in the right direction?
Just something to chew on.

Great post!  My favorite website for healthy snack ideas is http://www.snack-girl.com/ – maybe they could take a look and find some good ones for the store.  Lisa
I really enjoyed this article … especially the bit about the “Pepperidge Farm fortress.” :)
TroGro should definitely stock some of the healthier snacks available at The Lot, which isn’t open 24/7.

Wall evokes familiar memories
I was startled to see a familiar wall on the USC campus this week. In 2008, I graduated from UC Irvine, the original location of this particular wall. UC Irvine has experienced a lot of controversy regarding this wall and the issues surrounding it, so much so that the Muslim Student Union, the organization that builds this wall on the UCI campus every semester, is rumored to be investigated by the FBI.
I am very familiar with this wall, the protests, the controversial speakers and the bad press that has surrounded it and the UCI campus. And though I am very supportive of the Palestinian cause and feel it is important for USC students to be aware of it, I am extremely disappointed to see this wall as the way of sparking this conversation. I feel that this wall is not productive; it is a hostile, in-your-face accusation that offends many people.
Maybe this is the goal, but I offer this idea: In 2007, a group of UCI students ­— Muslim, Jewish, Christian and others — decided on a more productive way to educate UCI students about the conflict and what is really going on. We formed the Olive Tree Initiative and traveled to Israel and Palestine for two weeks talking to people from both territories. I learned so much from the people there, but what was most important was that Palestinians — and Jews — do not want or need us to be fighting their conflict on our campus. They want to get jobs, go to school, travel the world and raise families — in peace, without violence.
Last week I traveled to Lebanon and visited a Palestinian refugee camp. Those refugees didn’t hate Israel, and they didn’t hate the Jews. I asked them what they wanted and what I could do for them. All they wanted was dignity, to be treated equally, to get an education, to be able to get jobs and to see the world.
That is the cause we should be helping them with, not vilifying Israel. There is enough of that. I agree that Israel, the United States and the world has wronged the Palestinian people, but fueling hate toward Israel doesn’t right these wrongs. I hope those who look at the wall and those who brought it to USC will ask how it helps the Palestinian people achieve these goals.
There are real things people can do for the cause. And I hope those who care about Palestinians, Israelis and ending the conflict in the region will look into the Olive Tree Initiative on their campus.

Trojan Family values compromised?
I am writing in response to the article titled “The Bunnies of the Pac-10,” by Genevieve Geoghan. Now, I love USC and I believe that it is a university that is founded upon solid principles. Such principles are highlighted in USC’s mission statement:
“We strive constantly for excellence in teaching knowledge and skills to our students, while at the same time helping them to acquire wisdom and insight, love of truth and beauty, moral discernment, understanding of self, and respect and appreciation for others.”
What a wonderful set of foundational principles for a top-tier university. And it is precisely because of my love for these values that I was concerned when I read Geoghan’s article. Specifically, I am confused as to how a university that extols these sorts of values could be involved in the Playboy casting call that took place at the Radisson Hotel on Saturday night.
It is common knowledge that USC owns the Radisson Hotel. Indeed, it is the “home away from home” for many freshmen students enrolled at the university. In addition, I doubt that anyone would disagree that USC must take responsibility for the types of events that it holds on its property. I mean, it isn’t as though Playboy just randomly walks into a building and begins taking poses at a casting call. Permission must have been granted, and because USC owns the hotel, it must be responsible for granting such permission.
Thus, one must ask questions such as: “If USC permitted such an event to take place on its property, then is this the type of ‘beauty’ and ‘appreciation of others’ that USC specifies in its mission statement?”; “Is this the sort of thing that we want to promote in the USC Trojan Family Magazine?”; “Is this the sort of thing that is going to get Mrs. Jones to send her daughter to USC?”
Seriously, we must ask questions such as these, and we must be honest. If USC answers “yes” to the above questions, then I think we ought to question the character of our university. If it answers “no,” then we had better receive an answer as to why the university’s actions do not align with its words. Either way, it is something to think about, and I would love for the university to respond to this article.

Joe,
What’s your deal?
Katharine’s letter is just another piece of anti-Israel propaganda. She writes, “I agree that Israel, the United States and the world has wronged the Palestinian people”… in other words, she agrees with every anti-semitic SJP garbage on the basic facts, and wants us to take it as fact on the basis of her “I’m above the fray” self-congratulatory rhetoric. Screw that.
Joe, you are right in that it she is misguided to think that Israel or the United States are to blame for the Palestinian people’s condition, but at least Katharine gets one crucial thing right that most proponents on the Palestinian side will never even come close to realizing or admitting.. she says “That is the cause we should be helping them with, not vilifying Israel.”  So while she still might be far from the truth, at least she has caught on to the fact that there are ulterior motives for those who attack Israel that have nothing to do with helping refugees, and she is trying to work against that.
Katharine Keith’s “Wall evokes memory” piece is an absolute gem.  I applaud her enthusiastically for conveying what we too often do not hear- a sense of humility and compassion for both sides.
She nails it on the head.  We should not be villifying Israel with petty and ridiculous displays of fear and hate like this wall, we should be having a mature discussion about what both sides should do differently.  The hateful attacks against Israel on campuses must stop.
Great job Katharine

When I was notified that I had been accepted to USC, I was greeted with a charming folder full of USC paraphernalia showcasing all the school had to offer. I immediately planned a visit, read through all the materials I had received and went online to research the university even more than I already had in the application process.
After my official tour of campus, I received a personalized, handwritten thank you note from my tour guide, which made me even more excited about attending USC.
With USC, it’s the small gestures it takes that persuade prospective students to choose USC over other universities.
According to Ruthie Pyles, the Admission Center manager and associate director of admission at USC, the three most popular admission programs for prospective students at USC are Explore USC, Preview USC and on-campus discussion programs. These programs allow students to see the campus learn important information about the different academic departments here. In addition, the Office of Admission offers a spring open house program, which allows prospective admits to look at dormitories.
“We offer more events than many other universities in the U.S. We offer one [program] almost every single day … in April,” she said. “The programs can be extremely expensive, such as the Explore USC program, where they’re basically here all day long … or they can be here for a half-day, which is our Preview program.”
The events are geared toward making students feel comfortable and part of the large USC community.
“Some [events] are alumni-related, some are just admission-related. We really want to give students multiple opportunities to get to know the university on a variety of levels,” Pyles said.
Students admitted that those programs helped them picture themselves living and learning on the USC campus for four years.
“They had an event where they brought out the marching band and I got to see all the accepted families,” said Diana Toma, a freshman majoring in international relations. “I also really liked the atmosphere — that was just an emphasizing point and it drove it home for me.”
This same event made me feel like I was being inducted into the Trojan cult. After watching the marching band and raising my fingers into the Fight On position, there was no turning back.

The Explore USC program also helps students make the decision to attend USC.
“I think it was the combination of both the fact that I received the Presidential Scholarship as well as the Explore overnight program because I definitely had a different path in mind for me, but that really changed my perception of the school into the whole package that it really is,” said Ian Nelson, a sophomore majoring in business administration and accounting.
The tour guides at the Admission Center said they use the tours as a way of showing potential students places on campus where they would especially be interested in visiting.
“We switch up our tour route to kind of tailor it to the students,” said Emily Munson, a tour guide and senior majoring in economics. “After the tour, we write individualized notes. Sometimes I include my personal e-mail address with the groups I had a lot in common with … so that I could personally help them with the transition from high school to college.”
Those precise qualities and programs helped me acclimate well to the large community at USC and made me feel welcome from the get go.
Besides the positive qualities that USC cannot take credit for — such as the school’s ideal location in California and temperate climate ­— students agreed that USC’s programs, faculty and alumni base help sell the university to potential students.
“I got the impression that there were teachers here that really valued the undergraduate education,” said Stephen Lamb, a junior majoring in history.
When it comes to reaching out to prospective students, USC goes above and beyond its call of duty as an academic institution and does its students right by providing as many resources as it can to make students’ college experiences superior to other schools. This experience starts at the initial level of just welcoming potential future students to the campus.
Because of all the work and effort USC puts into giving prospective students a look into their possible futures at USC, the school has students who are happy to be here and excited to learn and thrive.
The process starts at the beginning, and if it had not been for the exciting USC programs I took advantage of during my final two years of high school, my college experience might not have been as valuable and wonderful as it have been.

During the past few months, USC football coach Lane Kiffin has taken many steps to differentiate himself from the outgoing Pete Carroll. Given USC’s struggles last season, who could blame him for wanting to make a fresh start.
Kiffin has already earned the reputation as a stern disciplinarian in stark opposition to his predecessor. In addition, he reopened the starting quarterback role for the upcoming campaign, announcing that Mitch Mustain and incumbent Matt Barkley each had a chance to prove their worthiness in spring practice.
Kiffin stirred up even more curiosity at practice this week by mixing up his offensive formations. Kiffin has been experimenting with the wildcat offense, which is characterized by a direct snap to a running back and an unbalanced offensive line.
He moved 250-pound redshirt freshman and defensive end James Boyd to quarterback, the position he played in high school. Later, he thrust freshman running back Dillon Baxter — who also spent time in that role before coming to USC — into the quarterback slot.
Kiffin was looking to test additional options at quarterback, as Barkley and Mustain remain the only two viable options until Lakewood High School graduate Jesse Scroggins reports to practice. Still, Kiffin admits, it’s unlikely Boyd will see regular-season time at quarterback.
“But for him to run around and make the plays that he made and throw the ball downfield … it’s a good option to have. So we’ll see. It’ll take a lot of work. But he’s still young,” Kiffin said.
Boyd led California with 4,266 passing yards and 44 touchdowns his senior year. Baxter threw for a state-record 79 touchdowns his senior season.
