Students gathered around Tommy Trojan on Thursday to deliver a letter to President C. L. Max Nikias demanding increased protections and resources for undocumented and international students.
In the wake of White House policies targeting immigrants, the students came together as members of OurCampus, an umbrella organization of student clubs looking to encourage inclusion on campus.
“It’s really just about connecting people on campus who are in some way feeling excluded or marginalized,” said Henry Mattei, a junior majoring  environmental sciences and economics and an organizer for OurCampus. “The goal of it is to make our campus a more inclusive place.”
The letter asks for physical and financial support for undocumented and international students. Mattei said that without support from the University, students are vulnerable to the labor exploitation and the loss of financial aid. In response, the letter requests a fund for affected students, along with other commitments to keep students secure.
The action comes off the heels of a similar letter sent by USC faculty to the administration with policy recommendations to better support students under the Trump administration.
Many felt that the University’s commitment to its international and undocumented students has been lukewarm. 
“The University has given out a lot of really vague statements on the value of diversity,” said Noha Ayoub, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture. “We want complete support from the University in this regard.”
Students entered Bovard Auditorium and delivered the letter to the office of Nikias. The letter was taken by an administrator who agreed to deliver it to Nikias. The administrator was unable to comment about the letter.
Students also visited the office of Provost Michael Quick. There, Mattei spoke with Quick’s assistant about the letter. 
“The response was very limited,” Mattei said.
Despite the lack of immediate action from the administrations, students are still optimistic. 
“It might not be the final thing you have to do, but it’s a step in the right direction,” said Julian Turner, a sophomore studying industrial and systems engineering. “It’s opened doors that weren’t open before.”
I can’t wait until you all get out in the real world, you will be so lost you won’t know your head from a hole in the ground.
Here’s goes that illegal-immigrant mafia again, “demanding” protections, resources, and God only knows what else.  You know what I demand?  That immigrants follow the law, just like my family and I did.  Also, stop lumping illegal immigrants in with international students.  Such a disgrace.

Two years ago, a comparative study of LGBT resource centers at top academic institutions found that USC’s center, at 169 square feet at the time of the study, was the smallest in the country. Since then, USC’s LGBT resource center has been expanded to include a new lounge, dubbed the “Lavender Lounge.”
“[The study] did draw some awareness to the size of the center,” said Rev. Kelby Harrison, the center’s director. “We were given about a 270-square-foot room to turn into a student lounge, which has been very popular.”
Ronnie Dong, a junior majoring in communication and sociology and the communication coordinator of the center, cited the center as a space of comfort for LGBT students.
“The Lavender Lounge is a really chill and safe place,” Dong said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “LGBT students can go [there] to do work, take a nap, grab a snack or coffee or just come to unwind and doodle on the walls, all of which are things I’ve done.”
According to Harrison, the lounge has built a community among USC’s LGBT students in a way that was not possible before.
“We certainly have a consistent group of students who make use of it daily or at least weekly,” Hamson said.
Dong agrees that the “Lav Lounge,” as it is known, is consistently populated with students.
“It’s small enough that it allows students to mingle and meet new peers as well,” they said. “It’s a comfortable space where anyone can come to relax or do whatever and having that accepting atmosphere at work is so relieving. Being at a place where I know my pronouns are respected — and I don’t have to hide my queerness — has really helped create a positive impact at USC.”
Lead undergraduate student worker Angel Zayas explained that the renovation has had a noticeable effect on the amount of students who come into the center, but that the space is lacking.
“I would say 10 times the number of people come in now,” Zayas said. “We could still use a lot more space, but I guess we’re working with what we have.”
Zayas feels that a comfortable space for not only the LGBT community, but also other communities on campus, is important. However, he believes that supporting minorities should be more of a priority for USC.
“USC has a lot of funds that go into a lot of other things,” Zayas said. “But they don’t see the value in having a space where marginalized communities can not only be around each other, but also escape. Especially in times like this, under a Trump administration and with hate crimes happening basically every day now. We have a lot of money going into the [USC village], and I’m sure it’s going to be amazing. That’s profitable, but serving certain communities isn’t always profitable, but it’s necessary.”
Additionally, Dong feels that the LGBT presence is smaller than they originally expected it to be.
“I wouldn’t say that the LGBT community is weak, but that it’s a niche and rather small and insulated,” they said. “The queer clubs that exist and the resource center [are] supportive and a good place to go for support and like-minded peers, but I still feel that overall USC doesn’t really tend to openly support or assist those marginalized identities, including but not limited to just the LGBT community.”
Despite these concerns, Harrison has noticed a growing sense of acceptance and inclusion that has extended past the center.
“Students make connections with each other there,” Harrison said. “Then, they can build friendships and relationships outside of that space, which is also healthy for our student organizations across the board.”
In addition to allowing for expansion, the University also doubled the LGBT resource center’s programming resources and staff budget in response to the comparative study, allowing the center to hire another staff person and more student workers. However, even with the extra resources and expansion, USC’s LGBT resource center is still smaller than the other centers compared in the original 2013 study.
“We’re still a couple hundred square feet smaller than the second smallest of our peer institutions, which is Rutgers,” Harrison said. 
The 2013 study found that the average size of LGBT resource centers is about 1,200 square feet. Rutgers University’s LGBT center has an area of 700 square feet, noticeably larger than the size of USC’s center even after it was expanded about 270 square feet. 
Harrison notes that more space at the center would mean more opportunities for the LGBT community at USC. 
“If there was more space, we’d have more programming, more community building, more people using the lounge,” Harrison said. “We know that students sometimes will stop by and it’s too crowded, so they’ll leave again.” 
According to Harrison, there is no space to expand the center in its current location, so the center hopes to relocate to an area with more space.
Dong would also like to see the center expand and continue to receive greater resources. 
“I think that these small programs can always do with being expanded further,” Dong said. “Though I wasn’t aware of the study, I’m not surprised at all. Hearing from friends at many of the UCs, they have a lot more space or resources or clubs for their LGBT students, and I think that USC could also take a page out of that and follow suit.”

” LGBT resource center expands to include lounge ” That is why I read the Daily Trojan for hard hitting stories like this.

Beneath the soaring main arch of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, a ceremony commemorating the centennial of the U.S. entry into World War I took place on Thursday, 100 years after the April 6, 1917 congressional declaration of war. 
The event was free and open to the public and organized by the California World War I Centennial Task Force, a volunteer-led effort of scholars, historians and citizens dedicated to celebrating the Forgotten Generation of World War I. 
“The United States World War I Centennial Commission was created by an act of Congress in 2013 to honor and commemorate our involvement in World War I,” California World War I Centennial Task Force co-director and amateur historian Courtland Jindra said. “Finally, near the end of 2016, we decided to create a completely grassroots organization in the hope that the state would give us their blessing once they saw we were forging ahead. And thus, the  Centennial Task Force was formed.”
The Coliseum served as a fitting site, as it was originally constructed as a World War I memorial and rededicated in 1968 to all 4.7 million Americans who served in the war.
“I wanted desperately to hold the event at the Coliseum,” Jindra said. “I’ve been fortunate enough to have built a strong working relationship with the folks at the Coliseum over the last few years, and they graciously agreed to host this event.”
Jindra conceptualized the idea to transport the audience back in time to 100 years ago by creating a narrative of events starting in 1914 and ending with Congress declaring war in 1917. 
Following the presentation of colors, performance of the national anthem and introductory remarks by Jindra, the program fulfilled Jindra’s vision — veteran and director-producer Jonathan Flora narrated the history leading up to U.S. involvement in the war, inviting up a diverse cast of presenters to help tell the story. 
Representatives from the Daughters of the American Revolution, the American Legion, Veterans in Film and Television, the California Highway Patrol, the Los Angeles National Cemetery  and branches of armed forces service all took the podium to read excerpts from such historical sources as Los Angeles Times articles, eyewitness accounts and the Zimmermann Telegram. Actors Michael Broderick and Gay Storm even sported costumes to bring the roles of President Woodrow Wilson and First Lady Edith Wilson to life. 
The ceremony was enlivened by performances from singer-songwriter Annie Boxell and veteran Rudy Gutierrez, who played authentic military taps on the bugle. 
Los Angeles National Cemetery Director Thomas Ruck, Belgian Consul General Henri Vantieghem and German Consul General Hans Jorg Neumann were invited to lay the ceremonial wreath in closing. 
The Task Force has plans to hold more commemorative events in Southern California throughout 2017 and 2018 as well as to reinvigorate annual Veterans Day and Memorial Day celebrations at the LA Memorial Coliseum. 
“For many decades after the Memorial Coliseum was built, it served as the city’s main gathering place for patriotic observances in addition to serving as the greatest stadium in the world,” said LA Memorial Coliseum Commission Chief Administrative Officer Robert Osborne. “Today, the Memorial Coliseum once again serves as a historic site not just for Independence Day, but also for Memorial Day, Veterans Day and other historic observances.” 
Jindra credited the volunteers with the success of the event, as their passion and efforts have spurred similar centennial commemoration events to take place in Claremont, San Francisco and a handful of other cities across the nation.
“The event is entirely self-funded, and all our participants in the program have volunteered their time and effort,” Jindra said. “There are only a handful of volunteers in the L.A. area that have put this together, so it is an example of what dedication can accomplish.”

With just over one week remaining until the annual Spring Game on April 15, the USC football shifted its practice location to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum for Thursday’s spring ball practice. The Trojans now have only four practices remaining this spring.
An extended red zone period for USC during Thursday’s practice pitted the Trojan defense and offense against one another. 
Pittman making strides
Sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman reeled in a tightly contested touchdown reception over sophomore cornerback Jack Jones during Thursday’s overtime red zone period. This grab from Pittman was one of the highlights of Thursday’s practice. 
“[Pittman] was put in some one-on-one situations throughout the day, and I thought he did an absolutely tremendous job,” head coach Clay Helton said. “He made a big play that set the tone for our overtime practice today. A really solid job from him today.”
As a true freshman in 2016, Pittman reeled in six receptions for a total of 82 receiving yards on the season. In addition to filling in the receiving rotation, Pittman also saw time on the special teams unit. 
The highly documented departures of former USC receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster and Darreus Rogers have left vacancies at the receiver slots for USC in 2017. Pittman is a prime contender to fill out a starting role at wideout for the Trojans this fall. 
Tight ends developing
The tight end position was a pleasant surprise for USC in 2016. The emergence of junior tight ends Daniel Imatorbhebhe and Tyler Petite as reliable pass-catching options helped open up the aerial attack for USC last season. 
During Thursday’s practice, freshman Cary Angeline, who redshirted this past season, made an impressive touchdown reception — dragging his feet inbounds — in the back of the end zone. 
“I thought that the redshirt year really was a big help for him,” Helton said. “He has always been a natural pass catcher. Where he’s trying to get better right now is his run-blocking.”
Standing at 6-foot-6 and weighing nearly 230 pounds, Angeline could prove to be another asset for the Trojans’ blooming tight end corps in 2017. 
Injury notes
Senior guard Viane Talamaivao’s surgery on his partially torn right bicep was successful, according to Helton. Helton said that Talamaivao, a three-year starter at right guard, should be healthy and prepared to participate in fall camp workouts later this offseason. 
Another injured member of the USC offensive line is freshman early-enrollee Andrew Vorhees. Helton reported that Vorhees has been dealing with a back injury that may keep him out of practice for the remainder of the spring. 
Junior cornerback Iman Marshall was limited during Thursday’s practice, as he is dealing with a grade one shoulder sprain.

The No. 9 women’s lacrosse team (9-3, 3-0 MPSF) is set to play Oregon (7-5, 3-1) and San Diego State (8-4, 2-2) in a road series this weekend.
After dropping two straight road contests to Cornell and Stony Brook, the Trojans are coming off of three straight victories over Ohio State (16-7), Fresno State (21-5) and Cal (21-4).
The recent win streak comes thanks to a Trojan scoring surge which featured 58 goals scored by 25 different scorers. Two of those scorers, senior Michaela Michael and freshman Kaeli Huff, earned MPSF Offensive Player of the Week and Rookie of the Week for their step-up play against Cal and Fresno State. 
After a six-goal performance against Ohio State, Michael took less than 20 minutes to score six goals against Cal and just five minutes to score a hat trick in a four-goal performance versus Fresno State. 
In the past two games, the senior netted 10 goals, grabbed 17 draw controls and added an assist, a ground ball and a caused turnover.
Huff, meanwhile, followed in Michael’s footsteps with a five-goal game of her own, adding three ground balls, two caused turnovers and a draw win over Fresno State.
Along with Michael and Huff’s play heating up, the Ducks and Aztecs will have to watch out for a Trojan defense that forced 32 turnovers and allowed just 16 goals over the past three games.
USC will travel to Eugene, Oregon first to play an Oregon team that has played poorly in recent outings, especially on the offensive side of the ball. After going 5-1 in the first six games, the Ducks are 2-4 in their past six, allowing 77 opposing goals to slip through.
The Ducks’ primary scoring threats are sophomore attacker Shannon Williams (37 goals, 18 assists) and senior midfielder Bella Pyne (30 goals, 11 assists), while Cambi Cukar acts as Oregon’s primary distributor with 28 assists. 
Despite playing the same number of games as USC, Oregon has turned the ball over 25 more times and caused 12 fewer turnovers. 
The Ducks could give the Trojans difficulties not just in the home field advantage, but also in ball movement as Oregon leads the assist battle 83-77 over USC.
After tonight’s matchup in Oregon, USC will travel to San Diego on Saturday to play an SDSU team that is 9-2 in its past 11 games.
Although the Aztecs have been porous on defense in 2017 (10.7 goals allowed per game), their offense can put the ball in the back of the net with ease (12.75 goals scored).
While USC relies on a couple of primary scorers to carry the team, San Diego State has a more balanced attack with six players scoring 13 or more goals this season.
With MPSF playoffs just three weeks away, the Trojans have just five games left to cement a national title campaign.

It takes a lot to turn a bad team into a good one. It takes time, patience and — most importantly — the right strategy. Using a top draft pick on a quarterback who turns out to be a bust or hiring a head coach who doesn’t pan out can set a franchise back five years — or more.
That’s why USC basketball fans can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that head coach Andy Enfield is a keeper. The 47-year-old inked another contract extension with the Trojans on Wednesday through the 2023 season, piled on top of the first two-year extension that he signed just a year ago that added on to his original six-year deal in 2013.
When it’s all said and done, Enfield could last a decade — or more — at USC, an impressive mark that is a testament to both Enfield and the school’s hiring decision.
Both extensions coincidentally came after Enfield’s name was linked to other jobs on the market. Pittsburgh reportedly had Enfield on its radar last year, and this year — following the Trojans’ deepest run in the NCAA Tournament in eight years — he was listed as one of Georgetown’s candidates for its coaching vacancy in a Sports Illustrated report. Neither job went to Enfield, and each time, it was followed with the reward of more padding on his USC contract.
There are two takeaways from this. The first is that USC is not the only program that sees Enfield as a commodity. That’s the kind of coach you want leading your program: one that other programs — and established programs at that — respect enough to consider hiring themselves.
The second is USC’s belief in Enfield — and vice versa — that gave him the time and space to turn the program around.
Enfield rose to public attention in 2013 when he led a Cinderella team in tiny Florida Gulf Coast (AKA “Dunk City”) to the Sweet Sixteen, a run that landed him the USC job. But he’s proven to be much more than a flash in the pan, turning his 15 minutes of fame and moving them to Southern California, where he has methodically built a basketball program on the rise.
His first year, the Trojans won two conference games and finished last in the Pac-12. His second year, they won three and finished last again. “Dunk City” seemed a thing of the past, the 15 minutes of fame to have run past their course and basketball at USC stayed an afterthought.
But Enfield remained and his blueprint for the program finally started to blossom in his third year. Guards Jordan McLaughlin and Elijah Stewart, key players from Enfield’s first recruiting class (now both juniors) developed into leaders. Now-sophomore forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu, lanky big men that highlighted recruiting class number two, provided the raw size and NBA-caliber talent that the Trojans had been lacking for years.
That quartet — combined with the since-departed Nikola Jovanovic and Julian Jacobs and strong bench depth — gave USC its first berth in the NCAA Tournament in five years.
That was significant, but perhaps even more significant was seeing Enfield’s vision translate into wins. Even in the losing seasons, you could see spots of Enfield’s high-octane offense here and there — the fast pace, the run-and-gun style. “Play fast, play hard, play unselfish” was the motto. Problem was, the players, leftovers from before Enfield’s tenure, didn’t necessarily fit the vision. It took a few years — and some fortunate patience from then-Athletic Director Pat Haden — to swallow the losses and allow Enfield’s recruits to filter in, to learn the system and to thrive in it.
Now, it appears Enfield has it: the players, the system, the reputation. McLaughlin, Stewart, Metu and Boatwright are the backbone, and if Metu and Boatwright don’t enter the NBA Draft, those are four quality upperclassmen that any good program needs.
This year’s freshman class picked up on the system well and should transition nicely into sophomores. Guards De’Anthony Melton and Jonah Matthews both played like seniors at certain points last season, forward Nick Rakocevic sparked USC to an impressive comeback win over Providence in the “Four Four” matchup in the NCAA Tournament and guard Harrison Henderson has been singled out by McLaughlin, a team captain, as someone who has “gotten better each day he’s stepped on campus.”
Throw in prized recruit Charles O’Bannon Jr. and Duke transfer Derryck Thornton, and that is a loaded roster. But beyond that, it’s a roster filled with Enfield’s players, fit to his vision of “play fast, play hard, play unselfish.”
“If this team stays together with our recruits coming in next year,” Enfield told me last month before the Pac-12 tournament. “We think it’s a special team now, but with another year of experience, I think this program’s headed in the right direction.”
Next season will be Enfield’s fifth at USC, and it’s safe to say that instead of being set back five years from his hiring date in 2013, the basketball program has found the right man and is leaping forward to new heights.

The top-ranked Trojans will look to remain undefeated on the season as they finish out six of their final 10 regular-season matches at home. The home stand will begin with duals against Washington and No. 15 Arizona State on Friday. 
The Huskies will kick off the day at 4 p.m. The team is 1-0 on the season, facing a much thinner schedule than other Pac-12 teams. The main event will take place at 6 p.m. when the Trojans take on Arizona State, a top-20 program that offers competition every year. USC has come out on top of all four previous meetings between the two teams, and the team brings the momentum of a 50-match winning streak into the dual.
The Trojans will follow up Friday’s dual with a trip to Manhattan Beach on Saturday for the USAV Beach Collegiate Challenge. The team will face off against Loyola Marymount, rematch against Arizona State and finish up against Saint Mary’s College.
While this weekend’s matches will give the Trojans a full bill of competition, they will also serve up an opportunity for seniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes to reach a 100-match win streak. The team is the only Trojan pair to reach 100 wins together, posting a 118-3 overall record in their career together. The duo has helped to lead the team to win 82 of its last 84 dual matches.
Despite the veteran leadership of Claes and Hughes, the rest of the Trojans’ pairs are newly formed this season. However, that hasn’t kept them from excelling on the court. Junior Jenna Belton and Jo Kremer are 22-3 overall, notching an 18-1 mark in duals, and junior Terese Cannon and senior Nicolette Martin have notched 19 overall wins on the season. The No. 2 team of seniors Sophie Bukovec and Allie Wheeler, along with the No. 4 team of sophomore Abril Bustamante and freshman Joy Dennis, have both notched 12 victories so far.
With the goal of defending their two-time role as national champions, the Trojans are also looking to defend their seat as the Pac-12 champions this season. The team hasn’t lost a match since March of 2016. With only three weeks left until the Pac-12 championships, the Trojans are looking to continue their dominant streak to remain at the top of the conference and the country.

This Saturday night, I walked home alone after midnight. When I got home, I peeled wet, sticky packing peanuts off the soles of my shoes and threw them in the garbage. I checked my phone; Ned would be there in 20 minutes. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I’d stepped through space and time.
 Perhaps it’s that I had taken six shots earlier. Mostly it was because I’d just walked out the doors of a frat party — a reminder of another time in my life — and back into my own house, where I was awaiting the 28-year-old I was seeing to come stay the night — something relatively new to me.
 I’m not part of greek life. However, I went to a lot of parties on the Row my freshman and first half of my sophomore year. Enough that when I returned this weekend, as a senior standing on a platform in a back room, I felt an instant comparison between then and now.
 Springfest had fallen apart, and my friends’ friends were attempting to revive the night. We were too drunk and bummed to hop in an Uber to Santa Monica, so that’s how I arrived on the dance floor of an unknown fraternity. I badly wanted to enjoy it  because at 21 I feel weirdly wizened and because my freshman year I never really got to play the part. So I wordlessly grasped the other girls’ hands as a guy led us to the room full of packing peanuts. 
I danced and occasionally glanced at my phone. I couldn’t lose myself to the moment, though. Even though all of my visual surroundings brought me back to 2013, I knew I wanted to touch down to 2017 for the end of the night. Bobby, who I’ve been on two dates with, was trying to booty call me out to North Hollywood. He said he’d pay for my Uber and get me breakfast. He wanted to display the true marks of 21st-century chivalry, I guess. 
Instead, I lead the conversation with Ned, whom I’d seen a couple nights in a row, to suggest hanging out again. I knew he’d say yes. Buzzed and surrounded by the haze of Daisy Dukes and beer-stained floors, I walked home instead of calling a ride.
 All of the imagery of the night — the lights, the colors, the smells, even the outfits — were identical to my memories of freshman year. But none of the details were the same.
 My freshman year, all I wanted romantically was a guy who would hook up with me twice. Instead, I had a series of 11 one-time encounters (from kissing to sex) over the course of my first semester. Only one didn’t start at a party.
 The sensation of being pulled across a dance floor, knowing all eyes were on you and hoping your complete dedication to the performance of enjoying the beat would entice a guy to approach you — that is the sensation I associate with much of my freshman year sex and romantic life. Each one-time encounter gave me a momentary thrill. I only fully regret one of those hookups. I hadn’t even had an orgasm yet (and none of these boys gave me one), but there was something both exhilarating and comforting about the vodka-induced haze and a first kiss with a stranger.
 I am not nostalgic for it, but it’s something quite interesting to look back on. Then and now, I’ve experienced the typical aspects of college, and early-20s, hookup culture. Before it was laying in a twin bed, texting roommates to leave and walking home with smeared mascara at 5 a.m. Before I would scan the crowd for an acknowledging glance and walk up to almost anyone. Once I even kissed a boy without saying anything first.
 Now I go on two to four dates before getting intimate with a guy. And although I have my exceptions, I usually don’t like to have sex drunk anymore. Instead of a dance floor, it’s dating apps, and our first glances aren’t usually marked with the lust I used to experience early in college. 
We’re more trepidatious when we meet offline. We mark each other in a different way. Sometimes there’s still the haze of the bar light to keep things mysterious, but I like getting to know people in the daylight a bit more now.
 Neither early-college nor early-20s hookup culture is ideal. But as my black shoes hit the sticky blue floor on Saturday night, I honestly did laugh to myself a bit. I felt like I’d seen it all.

Clean Bandit, Zara Larsson and Starley joined forces to electrify Los Angeles at the Fonda Theater on Wednesday. Although its energy resonated through the crowd, Clean Bandit’s performance quality was not up to par with fellow performers.
 Starley opened the show beautifully, gracing the audience with her soulful vocals and contagiously soothing energy. She waltzed around the stage in her bright orange cargo pants with the aura of a seasoned performer, although the young Australian singer-songwriter released her first hit in 2016.
With her diverse mix of acoustic and high-energy performances, Starley left the audience curious about her unique sound. 
Following Starley, Zara Larsson captivated audiences immediately with her hit “Lush Life,” complete with incredibly talented backup dancers to complement her sound. With her smile lighting up the room, the Swedish singer-songwriter’s attitude, cheekiness and playfulness were immediately evident.
Her performances were centered around feminism and sexuality, a common theme in her lyrics. Her girl posse, dressed in pink and black clothing, demonstrated an individuality and attitude rarely seen in pop dancers. Larsson’s dancers were part of a story of strength, attitude and pop perfection.
 The illusion of a pop girl group added to Larsson’s performance rather than detracted from it, simply because her vocals were outstanding and consistent. Larsson was undoubtedly the highlight of the night, from her cover of Ed Sheeran’s “Shape of You” to “Ain’t My Fault.”
 Following Larsson’s phenomenal performance, audience members held high hopes for headliners Clean Bandit. Unfortunately, the band didn’t deliver as well as Larsson and Starley.
 From the moment that it stepped on stage, Clean Bandit attempted to cultivate an avant-garde, off-beat performance that didn’t match their sound. Its songs would switch from somber, slow instrumental to fast-paced, electronic dance in an instant, which made several performances appear choppy.
 The vocal accompaniments, who replaced featured artists on various Clean Bandit tracks, revealed talent and musical accuracy. They showcased their range, finesse and vocal ability and were clearly the centerpiece of Clean Bandit’s set. 
Despite its talent, it was unable to convey the same zest that audiences expected from the group — not because of a lack of talent or passion, but because of logistical circumstances. Although many DJs and electronic music groups have learned how to fill the gap of featured artists in solo concerts, Clean Bandit has yet to master it.
 To the band’s credit, it was able to engage the audience with their music, but this effort was unsubstantial, and failed to fully capture the audience’s attention. 
Clean Bandit delivered upbeat tracks and gave most a fun night, but a concert should be more than simple beat drops and thoughtless dancing. The band missed the mark in truly connecting with the audience’s emotions and drawing them in with every beat in the music.

Brightly adorned blue and white tables lined the open area of Alumni Park early Wednesday morning, creating a large space for passersby to explore.
Presented annually by pro-Israel organizations and SC Students for Israel, Israelpalooza celebrates Israeli culture through booths showcasing music, innovative technology and foods. SCSI is a cultural student organization that aims to educate the USC community about aspects of Israeli culture to increase understanding and awareness. Israelpalooza was designed to achieve that goal.
“We wanted to make a             booth-like structure where people would enter in an open space,” said Chase Nathan, the primary student organizer who worked with SC Students for Israel. “We wanted people to be able to walk around and see [everything].”
Tables were covered in blue and white decor — the colors of the Israeli flag — creating an inviting atmosphere for the food, drinks and prizes for visitors. Each table offered a unique aspect of Israeli culture to visitors.
Three booths primarily showcased traditional Israeli food for visitors to sample. Others covered a variety of gadgets: One booth featured virtual reality glasses designed in Israel, and visitors were encouraged to examine technological advances. The final booths featured Israeli music, contributing to the lively cultural environment.
Many of USC’s pro-Israel clubs came out to support the event and set up booths in Alumni Park. SCSI had representatives at the event and posted various pictures on Facebook with the hashtag #Israelpalooza2017. Trojans For Israel, a secular and political organization that advocates for the vitality of the U.S.-Israel relationship, and Mishelanu, a club for Israeli-American students to enjoy Israeli cultural events and bonding activities, participated in the event as well.
Some of the other organizations not affiliated with USC also made an appearance. One such organization was Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, a national group with chapters across the United States. It hopes to address the various needs of Israel defense force soldiers, in addition to aiding the families of fallen soldiers.
FDIF’s L.A. chapter came with a poster featuring an Israeli soldier and answered student questions about its mission.
Nathan first received the idea of organizing this event from USC Hillel.
“I would explain Hillel as the home of most of the Jewish activity on campus,” Nathan said. “SCSI, TFI, Mishelanu are all run through Hillel, but they are their own clubs.”
Through the support of USC Hillel, Nathan was put in contact with Tal Segal, USC Hillel’s Jewish Agency Israel Fellow. Israel Fellows are young Israelis who come to work at universities to help educate Jewish and non-Jewish students on Israeli culture. Segal serves this role in USC’s Hillel and was the first to reach out to Nathan about putting together Israelpalooza.
Segal and Nathan were able to recruit organizations and volunteers. Even USC Hillel joined in, hosting a booth with a Israel trivia game where visitors could win prizes based on their knowledge.
Israelpalooza is not a new event at USC. But this was Nathan and Segal’s first year organizing it, and for the last two months, they have endeavored to make this year’s event the best it could be.
“We sat down and decided what we wanted to have, what worked last year, what didn’t work and what we wanted to change,” Nathan said.
Though the event featured fun music and delicious food, the hosts of the event hoped it captured more than that.
“Israelpalooza is meant to be tied to Israel’s Independence Day,” Nathan said. “But we didn’t put that much focus on Israel Independence Day. We just wanted people to come and ask questions, take a picture. We mostly just tried to show Israel in a positive light.”

Brightly adorned blue and white tables lined the open area of Alumni Park early Wednesday morning, creating a large space for passersby to explore.
Presented annually by pro-Israel organizations and SC Students for Israel, Israelpalooza celebrates Israeli culture through booths showcasing music, innovative technology and foods. SCSI is a cultural student organization that aims to educate the USC community about aspects of Israeli culture to increase understanding and awareness. Israelpalooza was designed to achieve that goal.
“We wanted to make a             booth-like structure where people would enter in an open space,” said Chase Nathan, the primary student organizer who worked with SC Students for Israel. “We wanted people to be able to walk around and see [everything].”
Tables were covered in blue and white decor — the colors of the Israeli flag — creating an inviting atmosphere for the food, drinks and prizes for visitors. Each table offered a unique aspect of Israeli culture to visitors.
Three booths primarily showcased traditional Israeli food for visitors to sample. Others covered a variety of gadgets: One booth featured virtual reality glasses designed in Israel, and visitors were encouraged to examine technological advances. The final booths featured Israeli music, contributing to the lively cultural environment.
Many of USC’s pro-Israel clubs came out to support the event and set up booths in Alumni Park. SCSI had representatives at the event and posted various pictures on Facebook with the hashtag #Israelpalooza2017. Trojans For Israel, a secular and political organization that advocates for the vitality of the U.S.-Israel relationship, and Mishelanu, a club for Israeli-American students to enjoy Israeli cultural events and bonding activities, participated in the event as well.
Some of the other organizations not affiliated with USC also made an appearance. One such organization was Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, a national group with chapters across the United States. It hopes to address the various needs of Israel defense force soldiers, in addition to aiding the families of fallen soldiers.

For many NCAA student-athletes, the overarching goal of playing collegiate sports is to turn pro. The better ones are given scholarships to play for universities, which provide a platform and spotlight for athletes to showcase their skills. But here is where the end games contrast: Schools want their student-athletes to stay all four years, to commit to an institution that committed to them.
Athletes, however, understandably have an urge to head to the draft. They want to chase money and fame while escaping the hindrance of going to classes. Plus, a freak injury could cut their career short — a career ending as an amateur without making a single penny. 
USC, like other major athletics programs, has seen its fair share of student-athletes forgo their college eligibility before graduating. Next season, the football team will lose two of their best players in Adoree’ Jackson and JuJu Smith-Schuster, both juniors who declared for this year’s  NFL draft. 
In the past few weeks, however, the men’s basketball team has seen a couple of its players declare for the draft prematurely. Last week, redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron decided to turn pro — although he didn’t hire an agent, which would allow him to remain with the team if he chooses. Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright did the same on Wednesday, and fellow sophomore forward Chimezie Metu is expected to follow suit.
The two forwards make up the Trojans’ starting frontcourt, and losing them — along with a quality bench player in Aaron — would be a big blow for a basketball program on the rise. And for them, deciding to turn pro early might hurt these athletes in the long run. 
It’s understandable, of course, for each of these players to pursue a career in the NBA. That’s the goal for any Division I college basketball player, and the hard work that they put in throughout the season helps to build a portfolio for future success in the league. But both the players and the team would fare better in the end with a few more years spent together.
Take Boatwright, for example. His explosive 24-point performance fueled the Trojans’ comeback against Providence in the first round of the tourney, and his impact on this year’s team was undeniable. But Boatwright spent half of his sophomore year riding the bench and nursing a knee injury, which limits his experience on the court. Subsequently, Boatwright isn’t even in the picture in experts’ mock drafts — CBS Sports doesn’t have him in its top 75 and DraftExpress left him out of their top 100 prospects. 
The same goes for Aaron, who came off the bench last season to average just 7.6 points per game and not score a single point in three NCAA Tournament games. There’s very little chance he draws much interest from NBA teams. The only USC player who could be selected — if he declares for the draft — is Metu, who both CBS Sports and DraftExpress put at No. 39.
The simple fact is that only 60 players are drafted into the NBA each year. The percentage of men’s college basketball players who turn pro sits at an astoundingly low 1.1 percent. For every kid thinking he has a shot at making the NBA, unless he’s UCLA basketball phenomenon Lonzo Ball, there’s likely another kid across town with a skillset equal to or greater than his.
For student-athletes, staying in school all four years benefits both them and their team. At age 18, 19 or even 20, players who aren’t projected to be top draft picks are raw, with plenty of potenial but lacking in experience — experience that playing for our years in college can provide. And graduating with a degree is never a bad idea, as it provides a backup plan if sports falls through.
For the team, having players commit to the full four years of their careers provides continuity and experience to the program. Few successful programs — save perhaps Kentucky — can survive the “one-and-done” scenario of freshman leaving for the draft after just one year in school. 
USC can’t keep players from leaving, but it would be in all parties’ best interest if everyone stayed to propel a program on the up-and-up. The pre-season rankings released this week might be way too early, but they do reflect the impact that the Trojans’ run in the NCAA tourney made throughout the nation this year. It’s a big deal for any Pac-12 team to be predicted in a slot for the top 15, and it’s an especially big deal for a team that struggled to consistently qualify for the Big Dance. 
Now, as the Trojans are gaining noteriety for their basketball prowess, two of their best players and a third pivotal bench contributor might jump ship, robbing head coach Andy Enfield of three upperclassmen who could provide invaluable experience to what is still a young team. And likewise, Aaron, Boatwright and Metu will benefit from another year or two of development, in which they might land higher on mock drafts in 2018 or 2019. 
It’s a win-win scenario, one that players on the current roster can talk about with former basketball players Nikola Jovanovic and Julian Jacobs, who both declared for the draft last season after their junior years. Neither was projected to be selected, yet they both went for it. As of today, they’re both in the D-League — the NBA Development League — and neither has made it to their NBA dreams.

As summer approaches, internship season is upon us. USC’s wonderfully long May-August summer offers ample time for students to travel, explore, work and play — and, for those of us who are politically inclined, to pursue an adventure in our field. 
Resources on campus offer excellent programs to get Trojans into the great marble halls of Sacramento, Washington, D.C. and beyond. However, often the hardest part of securing a political internship — other than getting your foot in the door in the first place — is choosing where to intern and what to do.
Politics emcompass a labyrinth of fields and directions, from policymaking to campaigning and lobbying to activism. Some students are committed to a single issue, while others are enticed by the thought of working within a legislative body in general. Either way, when exploring where to begin a career in statecraft, one thing is certain: Do something that means something — to you, your community or the issues you care about. 
Too often, the process of internship-seeking and securing is tied up in the politics of prestige, impressiveness and name-dropping — the pressures faced here at USC to find the most resume-worthy position are probably mirrored at all elite higher education institutions. Campuses with ambitious students can often be double-edged swords– on the one hand, your contemporaries are brilliant, and on the other, you are all locked in a competition of comparison with one another.
The key to that great internship is not to seek out Morgan Stanley, Google or the West Wing — it is to find the thing that is genuinely meaningful, especially in politics. After all, in the end, the best experience was the one that meant the most to you. Find something challenging, or exciting. Expand your connectivity, reach new goals and explore. Politics is about money, and about prestige, and about power — on the surface. But the politics this country desperately needs is the politics of people — the politics of service to community, state, country. 
But how? The answer is often more simple than you think. First, seek out campus opportunities — facilities like the Unruh Institute of Politics can offer open doors that you might never have known even existed. Look into the fields that mean something to you. For those interested in environmental policy, these sorts of institutes, think tanks and activist bodies exist up and down the state and expand across the nation — Los Angeles, New York City, D.C. and more. Often, applying and seeking a position starts with something as simple as an email. These doors often aren’t as thick and heavy as one might imagine. The best opportunities come to those who search for them with an arrogant optimism — send a resume, and see what happens. Second, consider serving your own community. Your legislators are looking for interns throughout the year and during the summer. From your city council to the state senate and the governor’s office, there are opportunities open for those who seek them. 
In the end, politics is a vast field, and your future within it is decided in most part by what you choose to do with it. If you are searching for a way to become involved, learn more and — hopefully — make a difference, the field is waiting. Jump in.

The National After-school Summit on Wednesday focused on how after-school activities play an essential role in preparing students for college and entering the 21st-century workforce.
Hosted by the USC Schwarzenegger Institute in partnership with the After-school Alliance and After-School All-Stars, this summit aimed to spread awareness among public and private-sector leaders about the value of supporting after-school programs and their importance to the future success of students.
The summit was hosted by American Ninja Warrior’s Matt Iseman, who emphasized how important it was for children to receive opportunities. He also said that this program not only helps children to better prepare for college, but it also increases their parents’ productivity by freeing their mindspace at work.
Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger emphasized that after-school programs help keep children off the streets and out of danger’s way.
“For every dollar you spend on an after-school program, you save $3 to $6 down the line,” Schwarzenegger said. “We know that 70 percent of the kids come from homes where both parents are working. They are not there in the afternoon after 3 p.m. These kids need help.”

Opening remarks were followed by a discussion between Schwarzenegger and Van Jones, host of The Messy Truth on CNN. Jones asked Schwarzenegger about the importance of after-school programs, and Schwarzenegger said that the trend of both parents working is relatively new, which contributes to the need for these programs.
“I felt sorry for those kids, that they don’t have someone there helping them with homework … or whatever it is they need to do,” Schwarzenegger said. “If I want to give anything back to this country, that’s one of the things that I can do: To give back to my community, my state and my country by starting after-school programs and the whole movement.”
Los Angeles Unified School District Board Member Monica Garcia remarked on how these after-school programs have affected education overall. Along with Eloy Ortiz Oakley, chancellor of the California Community Colleges, Gerard Robinson, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and Heidi Sipe, superintendent of Umatilla School District in Oregon, Garcia discussed the role of after-school programs in keeping kids in school.
“After-school is about enhancing the services to young people,” Garcia said. “It’s about somebody caring, somebody being there but also really somebody investing in you.”
Sipe spoke about the positives of after-school programs focuses on and how they supplement the school programs to achieve federal educational goals.
“After-school helps students dream new dreams,” Sipe said. “It’s very difficult for kids, especially in rural areas, to dream about careers that they have never seen, they have not been exposed to. We support that with the classes to build the skills, build the confidence so they can move forward.”
The panel then discussed how these programs enhance creativity among students.
“Students don’t need anyone to incorporate creativity for them because students are creative,” Sipe said. “What we have to do is remove the barriers that stop them from being able to explore. They have natural curiosity. What after-school allows them to do is to play with it.”
USC Schwarzenegger Institute Global Director Bonnie Reiss said that the summit achieved its expectations.
“It inspired the education and after-school network leaders from all 50 states who are here today to go back and continue this important work,” Reiss said. “We continue to work with the remarkable coalition of people involved in providing after-school programs to the children of working, middle-class and low-income families, to learn from each other so the programs get better and better.”

On Wednesday, the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom transformed to accommodate the Annenberg symposium, an event hosted by the USC Graduate School’s Office of the Vice Provost.
At the event, Annenberg graduate fellows showcased their innovative and cutting-edge communications research through different booths and presentations.
The event featured “Stacy,” an episode from the docuseries “Finding Home.” The episode follows a 27-year-old Salvadoran transgender asylum seeker as she struggles to navigate her first months in the United States.
Stacy Alejandro tells her story as the directors of the short documentary, Abraham Troen and Sam Shaib, conduct interviews and document her journey. Other notable members of the project include producers Xin Li and Marc Mounier, and editors Yongle Wang, Elisa Oh, Erick Del Aguila and Mengna Lei.
Meredith Drake Reitan, associate dean of the Graduate School, discussed the importance of the symposium, citing the collaboration that the event fosters, especially with productions such as this one.
“When incoming students begin [their programs] in the fall, they have a chance to meet and talk about ways they might collaborate,” Drake Reitan said. “The symposium is the final event of the year and serves as the culminating moment where students are able to show their work.”
Troen, a master’s of fine arts  studying in cinematic arts, film and television production, said that when the creators of the documentary series came to work on the project, it wasn’t easy finding a subject who would perfectly fit the role the directors had envisioned.
“We met a lot of people and tried to explore who could open up, who was willing to share their stories and who could share their personal tale and not just focus on political topics,” Troen said.
Shaib, also a master’s of fine arts student studying cinematic arts, film and television production, said the crew faced challenges when filming. He said that because the documentary covered a controversial social and political conflict, it was sometimes difficult to depict the individual’s entire story.
“We want to personalize their stories and be able to tell their journeys because they hold important messages,” Shaib said. “And it’s not easy to get individuals to open up because of the controversy on these matters.”
Both Troen and Shaib saw the benefits of telling Alejandro’s story because it’s one that isn’t often told or heard. Alvaro Parro, master’s of fine arts studying cinematic arts, film and television production, emphasized the importance of documenting a story like Alejandro’s.
“There is a severe lack of awareness of the Latina trans community,” Parro said. “I wanted to work on a project that would raise more awareness of a marginalized community. I was compelled by Stacy’s charisma. To see her moving through Los Angeles and to see how she was able to bring so much meaning to her life so far from El Salvador was very courageous.”
Parro also discussed the difficulty of accurately depicting stories on the screen. According to Parro, it can be tricky to portray the story being told.
Shaib said the filmmakers have gained perspective through working on the project.
“Our challenges seem so trivial now,” Shaib said. “What we’ve had to go through is nothing in comparison to what they had to go through.”

The USC Price Athenian Society seeks to foster constructive dialogue regarding innovative solutions to California’s environmental policy by hosting business leaders. Wednesday morning’s discussion focused on enhancing the economy through progressive regulations, which protect and serve the environment.
The featured speakers included Timothy O’Connor, director of the California Oil and Gas Program for the Environmental Defense Fund, and Catherine Reheis-Boyd, the president of the Western States Petroleum Association. Price School of Public Policy Professor and Research Director for the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State & Global Policy Daniel Mazmanian served as moderator and situated the conversation around navigating contemporary policy.
In 2016, the California legislature passed SB 32, an initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 percent below 1990 levels by the year 2030. O’Connor advocated for the extension of cap and trade programs, current policy which controls greenhouse gas emissions by creating a limited market for companies to buy and sell emissions allowances.
“We try to find solutions to the world’s and planet’s pollution problems through leveraging the power of business and through finding solutions that can be sustainable, attainable and durable,” O’Connor said. “When you look at cap and trade, and the market-based mechanism behind it, [it is] one of the types of solutions that achieves pollution reductions at low costs and with an incentive to make them happen as fast as possible.”
O’Connor then began to unpack the “climate gap,” an analysis of the impact of climate change on people of color and communities of poverty developed in part by Professor Manuel Pastor. O’Connor echoed the beliefs of Pastor, asserting that these demographics are disproportionately burdened by pollution and climate change.
“There has been a tremendous upwelling of recognition that California’s program needs to do a few things,” O’Connor said. “It needs not only to fight climate change [but also] to be conscious and really assertive in terms of delivering benefits to communities. I call the cap and trade program that exists right now actually the single largest investment in disadvantaged communities in the world.”
California’s current cap and trade program cannot continue beyond 2020. Catherine Reheis-Boyd also endorsed the program’s continuation, asserting that the California Chamber of Commerce must litigate on behalf of local communities.
“The revenue side of this equation has become such an issue that it is imperative that they get a two-thirds vote such that the dollars can go to more broad connections,” Reheis-Boyd said. “The way we are doing it in California happens to generate revenue, and therefore how we use that revenue becomes very important.”
The speakers agreed upon California’s distinct potential to create impact across the board. From their perspectives, California is uniquely positioned to intersect economic prosperity with social and environmental consciousness.
Mai Mizuno, a sophomore majoring in international relations and visual and performing arts studies, shared her insights on the discussion.
“What was reinforced for me during this discussion was the notion that jobs and the economy do not have to come at the expense of the environment and public health, particularly for marginalized communities,” Mizuno said. “Yaking leadership on environmental governance is an opportunity to mutually reinforce both in a positive way.”
