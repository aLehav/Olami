The Undergraduate Student Government approved budget allocations and finalized student nominations at their final meeting of the spring semester Tuesday.  
Chief Financial Officer Adenike Makinde introduced the 2021-2022 fiscal year budget last week, which included increasing the student programming fee back to $64. With the increase, the budget created two more funds, consisting of an accessibility fund and a green engagement fund.
Amendments to the budget presented to the Senate during Tuesday’s meeting reflected the correct amount of funds allocated to each section. 
Amendments approved by the Senate included an increase to the amount of student stipends by $9,200, while decreasing the amounts for staff salaries, USG executive board office and operation funds allocations and legislative and executive allocations. Sen. Ruben Romeo III made such amendments. 
Sen. Brian Stowe also began the discussion of the 2021-22 fiscal year budget allocations by asking why certain programming assemblies received more money than other student assemblies. Other members, such as President Alexis Areias and Speaker of the Senate Ruben Romeo III, responded by recognizing that such assemblies often have talks with the budget committee beforehand about requested funds and that funding is received at the discretion of such assemblies.
Before the amendments to the budget allocations were made, Vice President Lucy Warren began the confirmation of student nominees with the six associate justice nominations for the Judicial Council. The Senate approved the nominations unanimously. 
The Senate also confirmed the selections of three more assistant directors under the funding department — the USG sector that provides “fiscal support and resources to various recognized student organizations and undergraduate students.”
Appointments for the communications department were also confirmed. The department holders will oversee tasks, such as facilitating communication between USG and the student body and ensure information, such as governing documents, are accessible on the USG website.
The Senate also confirmed Katelyn Lee, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, as the senior executive aide. In addition to her duties as student executive aide to the president and vice president, she will lead a legislative special committee to support all student affairs and advocacy regarding the coronavirus and USC operations in the transition to an in-personsemester. 
The establishment of the committee was approved by the Senate unanimously. Romeo, one of the co-authors of the resolution, expressed excitement about the resolution’s passing.
“I think that this is just a continuation of focus efforts towards COVID-19,” said Romeo in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “President Areias and Vice President Warren wanted to put an explicit specific unit to consistently be adamant about these efforts.” 
At the end of the meeting, President Areias and Vice President Warren introduced the 2021-22 Office Policy Manual, which dictates the rules and guidelines that all members of the Senate must follow next school year, which include proper use of electronic equipment and maintaining satisfactory academic progress. The policy also premised such rules and guidelines on the possibility of students returning back to campus. 
While members of USG will not operate in their full capacity over the summer, the coronavirus task force special committee and legislative branch committees may meet occasionally over the summer to ensure operations are running properly before the fall.

With the coronavirus pandemic eliminating the in-person element of academic environments globally, students have been forced to adapt to learning through a computer screen.  
However, it is not entirely up to the students to continue learning at the same speed or standard as in the pre-pandemic world. Rather, the upkeep of quality education falls into the hands of the educators. 
Equal to the pressure of continued learning during a pandemic is the pressure of continued teaching, and for USC professors, it has not been easy. 
Frustrations with administration
Ariela Gross, professor of law and history in the Gould School of Law, felt that the administration’s lack of transparency in the face of the pandemic increased the burden placed on professors. 
Gross is also the chair of the Concerned Faculty of USC, a group of almost 500 faculty members that was formed in 2018 under the administration of former President C. L. Max Nikias. Since the creation of the group, the Concerned Faculty of USC has published several letters and statements demanding improvements in moral governance from University administration. 
In 2020, the Concerned Faculty was again in conversation with Provost Charles Zukoski regarding the pandemic and the administration’s communicative shortcomings in relation to it. 
“It was very, very late in the process that the University finally announced that we would be online for this year,” Gross said. “Because we were constantly told to proceed as though we were coming back, people put an enormous amount of time into preparing for hybrid teaching. It was really unfortunate that we all put so much effort into something that was pretty clearly futile.” 
Gross and the Concerned Faculty of USC felt that the administration’s opaque communication and decision making over the summer significantly heightened the pressures felt by faculty, as they were tasked with developing an entirely new form of teaching with little time to prepare. 
On top of these pressures, faculty also dealt with cuts to their benefits and subsequent lack of explanation from the University to account for these cuts. The Concerned Faculty voiced their concerns about this at a summer meeting with Zukoski, yet did not receive a straightforward answer.
“People had concerns … about the budget, because there were significant cuts,” Gross said. “Faculty had their retirement benefits cut, and merit pay was cut. [There was] a lot of opacity about what actually required those cuts. It was blamed on the pandemic … but it’s been hard to explain why those cuts have continued.”
Though the group of Concerned Faculty will continue to push for increased transparency and accountability from the University, professors were forced to make do with what resources they did have in preparation for the coming year of online school. 
Finding joy with teaching over Zoom 
Erika Wright, a professor in both the English department of Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the medical education department of Keck School of Medicine of USC, used resources through Dornsife to become more adept in Zoom teaching. 
“Dornsife [collected] together different recommendations or different things professors had been doing,” Wright said. “The school did provide a lot of different tools and advice and tech support.” 
Though this compilation of advice and tools was helpful in preparing for the fall semester, the true learning curve wouldn’t occur until the semester actually began.
Despite summer preparation, Wright discovered that the emotional weight of Fall 2020, with stressors even beyond the pandemic, necessitated additions to course layouts. 
Wright began setting aside time at the start of every class to hear from every student. It began as “tech checks,” where Wright went around and asked everyone how their WiFi, sound and camera fared. As the semester progressed, the tech checks evolved.
“Going around and doing a tech check then turned into … a little check-in prompt. Every person would say something. That was something I wouldn’t have done in-person,” Wright said. “They’ll talk about not feeling as creative or as productive. Just a range of things that make it hard to feel connected. I think sometimes that helps alleviate that pressure. And then they’ll give each other advice, and then the chat will blow up with advice.” 
Changes that sought to keep students engaged proved helpful to professors as well. Wright found the pressures of online teaching to be slightly alleviated by honest communication with students on how everyone was feeling. 
“Some of the most touching and important moments [with students] have occurred in this venue,” Wright said. “Students have been amazing. [They] are pretty spectacular.” 
Charles Radovich, associate professor of mechanical engineering practice in the Viterbi School of Engineering, was similarly impressed by his students’ abilities to cope with the strenuous situation of the past year. 
Not only does Radovich teach a number of lab courses in Viterbi, he is also the faculty advisor for AeroDesign Team, a student organization that designs, builds and flies airplanes. ADT competes annually in the Design Build Fly Competition, hosted by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, which was held virtually this year on April 15-18. 
Radovich worked with ADT members to discover creative ways to build an airplane while adhering to coronavirus protocols. The team accepted the challenges and got to work, dividing into subteams that were each responsible for designing and assembling various parts of the airplane. 
“The team embarked on a full-on distributed manufacturing campaign,” Radovich explained. “Landing gear captain sourced and assembled components at their house. Wing and tail captain is building wings and tails at their house, and then we’ll ship everything to the chief engineer [to be integrated]. It was a little slow to get going … but the team is building an airplane!”
After months of planning, reworking and building, the plane will soon fly. Given that the competition cannot be held in person, the flight will be recorded and submitted for review.
“It’s going to be the coolest plane the team’s ever built,” Radovich said. “It may not be the prettiest or the most optimized, but the sense of accomplishment of building an airplane in your home and pulling this off is going to be pretty awesome.”
In addition to ADT, Radovich also faced the immense challenge of translating an upper division lab course, “Mechoptronics Laboratory,” which involves heavy hands-on experimentation, to a Zoom environment. 
Radovich and other professors spent the summer developing clever tricks to work around Zoom, such as enabling remote desktops and preparing lab kits that could be mailed to students’ homes. However, these still could not account for the disconnect between professors and students that inevitably comes with virtual learning. 
“The hard part is, if I can look at my students when I give a lecture, I can tell immediately if they are not understanding,” Radovich said. “I can have a lot more back and forth and I can correct in real time. But in the Zoom world … not a lot of conversation happens. A lot of people are just kind of listening along [and] approach it differently than they would have in a normal lecture style.”
For engineering students, being able to physically put things together is often imperative to gaining a holistic understanding of a concept. The inability to gauge students’ comfort with the material through Zoom was one of the difficult things for professors to overcome, and Radovich looks forward to a return to in-person teaching. 
For what it was, Radovich is proud of what his students have accomplished in this past year. It’s not easy to build an airplane even in normal circumstances, yet in the face of a pandemic, they did. 
Lessons learned from remote learning 
David Allen Moore, Thornton School of Music professor of double bass, shared a similar concern for ensuring that his students were staying connected and engaged through Zoom. 
Teaching double bass online is no easy feat, and technological shortcomings were the essence of Moore’s initial struggles. Early versions of Zoom interpreted musical sounds as background noise, thereby blocking them out. Tweaking the technology to allow for optimum video and audio recording was the first challenge.
Once Thornton became more comfortable with the technological aspects of distanced learning, Moore was able to recognize that there were subtle similarities between pre- and post-coronavirus learning environments for Thornton students.
“In a lot of ways, music and performance is always asynchronous learning,” Moore said. “Everyone’s working at their own level, and they’re only getting interaction with the professor one to three hours a week. The vast majority of their time is spent practicing by themselves.”
Students studying a musical instrument may spend a lot of solitary time indoors during any semester. However, with the heightened stress of the pandemic and the many other social catastrophes of 2020, Moore developed a new focus that aimed to encourage students during these stressful times. 
“It’s been really important to help sustain the optimism of my students that are looking at something that they’ve basically invested their whole lives in and then seeing it grind to a halt,” Moore said. “But if you can sustain your focus then you’ll come out on the other side and the opportunities will be there again. That’s been my focus over the year.”
Following this era of online connection, there are a few Zoom tricks that Moore intends to keep up his sleeve for future post-pandemic semesters, such as recording lectures for students who may be ill, offering online lessons while out of town and video conferencing with guest speakers. 
“All the professors that I know across the world … are all set up with the gear to be able to do this.” Moore said. “So you can have the freedom to contact somebody anywhere in the country, no travel fees, no hotel stays, and work within their schedule to bring them in to enhance the content.” 
Despite the pain of the past year and all of its losses, Oliver Mayer, professor of dramatic writing in the School of Dramatic Arts, found value in the learning experience that came out of Zoom.
SDA students and professors took a hard hit last March when the pandemic forced everyone into quarantine. 
“Our entire school is based on connection between people,” Mayer said. “Our work was all about being in the room together, warming up exercises together, laughing together and [having] serious discussions together.”
Disrupting that crucial element was heartbreaking not only for the students, but professors who had to find ways to keep students engaged even after the ability to be together was taken away. Mayer, though grieving for his students, recognized the life lesson to be taken from the experience of everything going wrong around you.
“I think that it’s the kind of thing that’s gonna happen anyway if you have a life in the business — in any business — you’re gonna get buffeted by the world.” Mayer said. “And if you survive it, I think you’re that much further along.”
With this mindset emerging during the pandemic, Mayer also realized the importance of bringing compassion to his classroom and ensuring students have the proper emotional support and encouragement needed to hold out until a time that the community can gather together again.
“I want [students] to remember that there will be life after this,” Mayer said. “We will return. We may never handshake the same way, but we will at least be in the same rooms. Stuff is gonna happen. The theatre is big and open. I remind my writers all the time that this, too, shall pass.”
As USC struggles toward the return of normalcy, or at least a semblance of it, Mayer applauds the students who have fought on through a year that was easy for nobody and trying to all, insisting that there has been value in the experience. 
“As soon as we give it our best selves, it becomes valuable,” Mayer said. “People are gonna be able to read that and see that in the work. Even when we’re past this and we’ve shut down the laptops … we’re going to remember these days.”

The American Bar Association’s National Appellate Advocacy Competition would usually take place in courtrooms around the country. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, participants competed from home. 
For Charlene Smith, this meant competing from her living room, where she had to tell her husband to leave because audience members weren’t allowed to be present while competing. According to Smith, the experience was “definitely different” than it would have been in person. 
“When you’re in a courtroom, it’s like you’re having a conversation with the judges, and they’re slightly above you, so you’re a little intimidated, but then you’ve got that adrenaline rush going … so it’s super exciting in that way,” Smith said. “Over Zoom, it felt like I was talking to professors or lawyers, and it didn’t feel quite as intimidating.”
Despite competing remotely, the USC Gould National Moot Court team finished in third and fourth place at one of the regional competitions of the American Bar Association’s National Appellate Advocacy Competition (NAAC) recently. The team was also recognized in the top 10 advocates list. 
The moot court team, composed of third-year J.D. students Nikki Long, Charlene Smith, Kelly Butler and Danielle Luchetta, recently competed at the NAAC and earned top places in the regional battle in San Francisco. Long and Luchetta won third place for best brief, with Smith and Butler taking fourth place.
Led by adviser Rebecca Lonergan, professor of lawyering skills and associate director of the legal writing and advocacy program at the Gould School of Law, the Gould team was the only team to win two spots in the top five briefs of the San Francisco region. Long was also honored among the top ten best advocates of the competition.
“They did a fabulous job,” Lonergan said. “I watched them grow through all those practice sessions, I watched them become better and better and better at their arguments, and I’m like, ‘That’s what you have to come away from it with.’” 
The path toward the NAAC competition began last November after the four law students were chosen among many applicants to make up USC’s national moot court team. According to Smith, after making the team, the students met with Lonergan, who introduced them to the competition and guidelines around it. The two main aspects of the competition were writing briefs and preparing oral arguments about qualified immunity to present in front of judges the following spring. 
The team wrote an approximately 50-page brief over winter break and found two additional faculty advisors to help them prepare for the competition — Sam Erman, professor of law, and Rebecca Brown, professor of law and the Rader Family trustee chair in law. 
“It was very intense, but we were just loving it,” Long said. “It wasn’t arduous work. It was enjoyable work. So, I think for us, the more preparation we could get, the better, so that way, we felt comfortable and went to the competition.”  
According to Lonergan, the moot court team spent many hours and days preparing, dedicating their weekends and evenings to meet with her through Zoom, where she would “grill them” and would go through their presentations in order to help them improve. 
The moot court team praised their advisors and said they played an important part in the training process. Long said all three law professors were instrumental to their success. 
“[The advisors] spent hours with us listening to our arguments, asking questions about our arguments, giving us tips and feedback, and I can’t imagine having a better group of coaches for that,” Long said.  
At the competition in February, a panel of three to four judges would hear the team’s arguments and ask questions about the cases the team was presenting. Each person had 15 minutes in each round to argue their cases and two minutes for rebuttal. 
One of the team’s challenges was that they had to compete over Zoom, rather than in a courtroom, where this competition was held pre-pandemic.
“It was hard to understand the judges or you do the awkward thing where you talk over them and you don’t know who’s going to talk because it’s on Zoom,” Butler said. “Then also just not being able to be near my teammates. I feel like that would have been a good morale boost.”
Besides the challenges, Smith said that the process could be subjective, and to remember that sometimes the judges may not like the argument or they may not connect with the person delivering  them.
“The main goal, I think, is to become a better oral advocate, not simply just focused on winning,” Smith said. “Because you can’t really control the outcome, you can only control what areas you’re growing, and that’s beautiful.” 
While the team did not advance to the next round of the competition,  each member will begin their preparations to take the bar exam in the next few months.  
Long aims to go into litigation and dreams of arguing important cases in high courts. Smith’s goal is to be an excellent advocate for her clients and explore positions such as a judge or a solicitor general. Both Butler and Luchetta will be going into litigation as well.
The lessons that they took from the competition are ones that will last them beyond their time in law school. Luchettta said this competition helped her refine both of her writing and oral skills. 
“Looking back on it, I have to say that it will go down as one of my most memorable experiences at Gould,” Luchetta said. “It is so rewarding to be able to work with some of the best professors that our school has, and also our teammates who are just so talented.”

In a little over two weeks time the No. 1 women’s water polo team will begin their quest for what would be their third NCAA title in the last five years.
The 10-team tournament includes the winners of seven different conferences and three at-large teams.  After finishing the regular season 17-1 while being atop the Collegiate Water Polo Association polls for 12 consecutive weeks, the Trojans will likely enter the tournament as the No. 1 or No. 2 seed depending on their performance in the MPSF tournament. This would grant them an automatic bid to the quarterfinals to play the winner of one of the two first round games.
When talking about what it is like to play in the NCAA Tournament, head coach Marko Pintaric noted how mentally challenging the games usually are.
“It’s the postseason, it’s different,” Pintaric said. “The stakes are higher, obviously in the NCAA tournament you don’t have that mental buffer because if you lose then your season is over. And I think that carries an extra mental burden on teams, coaches, and players. There is definitely a different energy and feel, everybody knows that this could be their last game so they are bringing their A-game or the best they have got.”
While the Trojans are the title favorites, the road to the championship will not be easy. Fellow powerhouse programs such as No. 2 Stanford and No. 3 UCLA each look to win their eighth NCAA championship. Even though USC took down the Cardinal in a tight two-game set earlier this year, the Trojans have to watch out for a school that has dominated the last decade with six NCAA titles since 2011. Stanford knocked out USC in five of those tournaments, including the 2019 National Championship game.
When it comes to crosstown rival UCLA, the Trojans know that the Bruins can never be taken lightly, especially after easily handing USC their first loss of the season — breaking the Trojans’ 23 game winning streak — on Sunday. After the Trojans won a tight defensive battle on Saturday, the Bruins came back strong and dominated the second game, winning 13-6. UCLA will enter the tournament looking to win their first NCAA championship in over a decade.
Senior driver and All-American captain Kelsey McIntosh discussed the significance of the tournament’s location.
“The NCAA Tournament is hosted at UCLA, and it’s always fun to play your rivalry team at their house just because the ultimate goal is to beat UCLA at UCLA,” McIntosh said. “But at the same time, two years ago we lost to Stanford at Stanford, so if we can beat them this year and avenge that loss I think it would be pretty special as well.”
McIntosh also discussed the pressures USC faces being consistently ranked the best team in the country.
“We know that people are coming for us — they want to beat USC,” McIntosh said. “That’s everybody’s goal and as the No. 1 team there is already a target on our backs. But we don’t go into the game thinking about how we are No. 1 and the best team; we go in there confident and not cocky because, ultimately, on any given day, any team can beat anyone.”
The 2021 NCAA Tournament selection show will take place on May 3 and the tournament itself will run May 14-16 at UCLA’s Spieker Aquatics Center in Los Angeles, Calif.

As schools prepare to return to normal, USC Rossier’s center EDGE created a platform to harness innovative solutions within the realm of education and prevent further inequity within the sector. 
To address faults in the education system exacerbated by the pandemic, USC Rossier’s Center Edge launched The Education (Re)Open — a four-phase program that looks to implement education solutions derived from the community — late-March. In its first phase, the solution phase, The Education (Re)Open looks to highlight innovative solutions via a competition format and provide local schools with ideas to implement during a full return.
“The idea is to have innovative solutions that people can implement into their specific ecosystem into their particular areas of study,” said Alan Arkatov, the founding director of USC’s center EDGE and leader at The Education (Re)Open. 
The Education (Re)Open is an opportunity to strengthen communities and enhance well being with the return to classrooms, in addition to online learning, Arkatov said. The program is particularly looking for solutions to enhance the Los Angeles community, particularly within K-12 schools. Over the course of 10 weeks, The Education (Re)Open is inviting and showcasing solutions from everyone navigating the challenges facing school communities during the pandemic.
Not only is the competition largely focused on providing a platform for solutions, but it also looks to implement the submitted ideas.
“We are at the epicenter of the imagination economy here in [Los Angeles],” Arkatov said. “We’ve got all this talent, and we’re not leveraging it for education, so that’s our mission on this thing — to engage as many folks with innovative solutions, and then put them into action.”
Up to one hundred solutions will each receive $1,000 for being featured. Following the selection process, The Education (Re)Open will unveil the “Solution Exchange,” a website for parents, teachers and students to access solutions and implement ideas into their own environment.
“We’re going to have other schools around the country pushing this out to their students,” Arkatov said. “We’re pushing [the competition] out among community organizations, education organizations, groups big and small. It can be parent groups, it could be teacher groups, it can be educator groups, all of the above.”
The competition format  will also attempt to showcase solutions that were implemented at schools but didn’t scale widely or new innovative solutions that came to light during the last year of the pandemic, according to Arkatov, founding director of USC’s Center EDGE. 
Arkatov expects the submitted solutions will cover a range of topics — including racial and financial inequality, lack of resources and changes to schedules —particularly because of the three broad categories including communities reconnecting, collaborative teaching/learning/leadership and collective health/wellbeing.
The pandemic itself and the need to change education for a full return to in-person learning created the perfect time for the competition, Alan Arkatov said.
“I think we’re at this inflection point in education history and this is a unique moment in time where we can really take the best practices and be able to highlight them,” Arkatov said. 
The submission process for The Education (Re)Open is simple and open to anyone passionate about redefining education, regardless of geographic location, according to Arkatov. 
“I’m really looking forward to knowing that we’re giving those that know education best — the students, the educators, the parents — we’re giving them a voice to actually be able to see the change that they’ve always wanted to be the right thing,” he said.
Arkatov said the means of finding suggestions for the return to in-person instruction relies on crowdsourcing education solutions to the people who know it best — parents, students and educators.
“That’s just not the way education has been done in the past,” Arkatov said. “Not to say everything was bad or everything was great, but there are some amazing innovative solutions that haven’t been put into practice.” 
Following the submission deadline, an evaluation phase, solution exchange and implementation phase will take place, Arkatov said. There are a series of schools within L.A. county that have signed on not only to submit ideas but to implement. However, the implementation phase has yet to be designed until solutions are chosen.
Arkatov said he believes there has never been a similar program like The Education (Re)Open’s because of the barriers of school boundaries and districts, particularly as different education rules and standards exist throughout the United States. Even within states, there are unique districts, totaling to over 13,000 school districts in the country. It was these challenges that showed that The Education (Re)Open would need funding in order to be successful. 
Andrew Nikou, USC alum and founder of the Andrew Nikou Foundation, agreed to fund The Education (Re)Open. The Andrew Nikou Foundation is a foundation which breaks through traditional silos of working by partnering and investing in scalable solutions and ideas that can improve the lives of people who are disconnected and oppressed. 
“The most urgent need became, how can we help the true frontliners of this challenge that has been the last 13 months — the educators, the unwilling understudies, the parents who overnight became an educator,” said Jules Ho, executive director at the Andrew Nikou Foundation.
Ho said the foundation found it important to support and fund the The Education (Re)Open program, particularly during the challenges of the pandemic, with multi-generational challenges, and the need to prevent further coronavirus spikes.
“All [the mentioned challenges] dynamics speak to a larger social goal of this current time,” Ho said. “It’s necessary to get behind this, we do believe, Andrew personally believes, that education is the key to if not everything, almost everything. The concept of how the pandemic has eroded, or exacerbated rather, the failings, the dark corners of this picture, and the notion that there are students who are being even more left behind and disconnected was something that we were keenly aware of.” 
Antwane Abraham, a junior at USC Hybrid High School, works with The Education (Re)Open within the context of his school and provides information and insight on reopening in the fall. Abraham said he personally struggled with learning during online school and said he hopes to help make the environment a more diverse and equitable space.
“I believe that The Education (Re)Open is going to have an amazing impact on students because more students will be able to learn and be hands on with teachers and it will also help students’ mental health because they will be able to socialise with others and not just through a screen,” Abraham said in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
For Ho, she sees the solutions derived from the submissions as a way to improve lives and empower oppressed demographics.
“We seek to partner with folks who have big ideas and big aspirations to create sustainable, scalable, positive change in our community,” Ho said. “We seek to empower those individuals in our community and society at large that basically would be otherwise left behind, oppressed or disconnected.”
Correction: A previous version of this article misstated The Education (Re)Open’s name as Education (Re)Open. A previous version of this article also included wording that was vague, and has since been clarified. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity. 
USC water polo head coach Marko Pintaric has been at the helm of the Trojans’ coaching staff for two years but is in his 20th season working for the program as a whole. A National Player of the Year, All-American, NCAA Champion and member of the Croatian Junior National Team, Pintaric has helped USC earn 14 NCAA titles across both men’s and women’s teams. 
In a season like no other, the Daily Trojan spoke with Pintaric on how the coaching staff and the players have relied on each other to make the season as fulfilling and productive as possible. 
Daily Trojan: So, following a loss like this [to UCLA] and heading into the postseason, how do you set the expectation for the team in terms of, you know, keeping their head straight and their minds as clear as possible so that they can go into those tournaments, you know, as focused as possible?
Marko Pintaric: Well I mean loss is a loss, it hurts, really hurts immediately after, but … look, every game is you learn, and we are taking this as a learning experience so that was the main thing that we addressed in our immediate meeting. [We] just reminded the girls that we did accomplish our goal that we set before the season, we didn’t accomplish a goal, we didn’t say we want to go undefeated … everybody wants to go undefeated. That’s the greatest goal, but our goal was to secure the best possible way, you know, for the season and that’s number one seed in the conference. We achieved that with the first victory and, you know, what else to address? 
So now from the game itself just learn from the mistakes so these mistakes don’t happen, so it’s a great learning tool for us to get better. And that’s what was addressed. And I really know my team; our team is very self-motivated, you know, they are true winners, and I have no doubt this group of women will come out stronger after this. 
DT:  You mentioned how playing the same opponent two days in a row is really difficult and something that’s unique about this season. How will it be going into the tournaments where they’ll go from day-to-day playing and different opponents and sort of reverting back to what they usually were used to last season?
MP:   By now we already saw everybody. And now we have our scouting ready, and we know who our possible opponents are. And so to that extent, it’s easier to get ready for one team for that first game and then you’d kind of try to make adjustments for the second game. So in terms of game preparations for us coaches, it’s easier to play and get ready for one opponent playing two games. It’s just hard mentally to win two games in a row, you know. 
That’s what I’m noticing, that’s my just personal note, so it’s learn and tell, but in a tournament, it’s harder right now because, based on the rankings, you might play against two possible opponents so for your first game you have to get ready for two, and so for us coaches we are getting ready to scouting reports and we are getting ready to win it all. So now that first opponent is a bit tricky, and then second opponent is really hard to predict because [in] that other bracket, you really don’t know who’s going to come out victorious. So, again, it’s got to be more of, getting ready, watching videos for the first possible two opponents, and then you go one game at a time. 
DT: How do you see underclassmen such as [freshman 2-meter] Hannah [Meyer] and [freshman driver] Julia [Janov] contributing to this tournament considering their performances in the past season?
MP: They’re learning, they’re adjusting. Reminder, it’s very unfair, you know, for a freshmen class to kind of get them into this situation because of [the coronavirus] and, you know, lack of preparation in [the] offseason. But the girls are doing great, I mean, they’re really learning, and they’re adapting, day by day, week by week, and I really envision them to play in regular rotations and earning, you know, significant playing time during this weekend because their playing time is actually giving us a great competitive advantage. So, the expectations are great, and I am pleased with their performance, even though, you know, we lost the second game. 
DT: So, how is the team now, sitting at No. 1 and heading into the postseason, different or similar from the team that had their season canceled back in March?
MP:  This is pretty much almost the same group of athletes, at the core. I mean Maud [Megens] joined us, obviously, and we are missing seniors that graduated from last year that were a big part of the team being successful. Because, you know, those who graduated last season, they stepped into a bigger role and they performed their role — surprising some people but not surprising us as coaches. So, the team, the anatomy of the team … it looks the same but is slightly different, but in terms of hunger — hunger to compete and to win is the same. You know, this is really a special group of women that really hate and refuse to lose, so it was really hard on them yesterday losing this game, but that team, and last year’s team, in my opinion — there’s that same desire.
DT: How did you keep the team camaraderie strong considering part of this season was just online meetings and then you’re already here at, like you said, tough back-to-back weekends where emotions are high and the expectations are even higher?
MP:  I mean we, we jumped to activities that we were allowed back to. Back then it was just Zoom meetings and we were trying to be creative with Zoom meetings, try to communicate as a team what can be done. That’s why I think our seniors really stepped in, where they really did not just play a role, a selfish role of just ‘being me,’ and they really thought outside of the box about the possibilities, providing good advice to coaches and the rest of the team … we did organize a series of, you know, Zoom meetings, talks, one-on-one meetings where you talk to the players and bring in alums to have a special guest appearances and just do activities that were permissible in order just to keep the sense of team and team chemistry going, and it was tough. It wasn’t easy. We really struggled and that first day when the team started training together, you could completely feel the difference and that’s why we were so happy that the athletic department and school allowed us to do this, and I’m super grateful and happy that we’re actually competing and playing this season.
DT: What have you taken away from this season as a coach?
MP:  I mean every season is different, and it’s a learning curve. I’ve been here for 20 years, and there are no years that are identical … every season is [its own]. So, like I said, this was the first season where we really communicated with seniors to the max, where we really asked for maximum feedback from the group. Because from a coach’s perspective, they earned it, they kept the team together, they came back, when they didn’t have to. And, you know, we’re really taking that into consideration, so this is a learning [experience] for me … I’m listening to the team more than I did as a head coach in my young head coach role … This is a year where we listened to our upperclassmen more, so that’s what I learned differently.

Once every few days, Francesca Jacke, who currently lives in Germany, opens her email to USC Student Health reminding her to schedule a vaccine appointment at the Lyon Center.
But Jacke, almost 6,000 miles away from Los Angeles, does not have that option. Despite her designation as a priority group because of asthma and Germany’s slower vaccination rollout, Jacke is hoping to get vaccinated by September. 
“It definitely feels like you just pulled the short straw when it came to your citizenship,” said Jacke, a a senior majoring in theatre and health and the human sciences. “It just feels like I’m unlucky.”
In L.A., all residents over the age of 16 have been eligible for the vaccine for weeks, and coronavirus cases are declining. But in many places across the world, the coronavirus situation has varied. 
International students at USC see both sides of this disparity — some receiving vaccinations in the United States even as more vulnerable family back home cannot, and others experiencing lockdowns and large outbreaks at home while friends at USC post vaccine cards on Instagram and look forward to relatively normal summers.
While Germany’s vaccination rate has been slower compared to the U.S., Jacke knows that other countries are in even worse situations. Her mom is currently living in South Africa, where Jacke grew up, and only 0.5% of the population have received vaccinations. Getting vaccinated this year, or ever, is not even an expectation for Jacke’s mom, she said. 
“It’s a very scary thought that she’s just not protected simply because of where she is in the world,” Jacke said. “It’s more just like this existential fear that I think a lot of people are having during this pandemic, where it kind of feels like it should be time for all of us to move on and get vaccinated and get back to a new normal, but some people get to have that more than others.”
Gigi Brito, a junior from Brazil, is a student worker at the University currently living in L.A. who recieved her vacination in March. The process was quick and simple, she said. But as she felt the relief of safety, back at home in Brazil, Brito said, her grandparents had not yet been vaccinated, and her parents still have no idea when they will be eligible to get the shot. 
“It’s definitely a very weird experience, because, obviously, I wish my parents could get vaccinated before I did, and I actually got vaccinated before my grandparents,” said Brito who’s majoring in architecture. “I wish I could just bring them here for them to be vaccinated, but I am American, and my entire family isn’t, so they don’t really have a choice.”
India is currently experiencing the worst outbreak in the world, with hospitals running out of oxygen, cities on lockdown and thousands dying a day amid accusations of the government undercounting deaths. For weeks, public pressure mounted on President Joe Biden’s administration for the U.S., a country with more than enough doses to vaccinate the entire population, to export raw materials and extra vaccines to India. 
As of April 25, the Biden administration finally agreed to share vaccines, exporting up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine — which has not yet been used in the U.S. — to other countries. 
Kasvi Malhotra, a junior majoring in economics and communication, is back home in India, where she is experiencing the outbreak firsthand. Many people she knows have gotten sick, she said, and some have passed away.
“It’s like every second person I know. Half my friends, half my extended family is sick, multiple members in my extended family have died,” Malhotra said. “This variant is so, so dangerous … I’m obviously really scared of falling sick because I’ve heard so many different reports of people my age — like 20 years old — dying.”
While only 8.8% of the Indian population have received a dose of the vaccine, compared to 42% of Americans, Malhotra’s parents have been vaccinated, and she hopes that she can get a dose sometime in May. 
As a way to stop the overwhelming surges in other countries, many are now pressuring the Biden administration to waive patents on the coronavirus vaccines as a way to broaden access. So far, the administration has resisted. 
Malhotra said that since the U.S. has more than enough doses to vaccinate its population and share vaccines with India, it should share its resources with other countries in need.
“[The U.S. is] sending us raw materials now. Why? Because there was so much pressure policywise on the U.S.,” Malhotra said. “It just looked so bad that they weren’t [sending materials]. I just think that the U.S. should be doing more.” 
Zuzanna Iwanejko, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, lives in Warsaw, Poland where neither she nor her parents have been able to get vaccinated. Someone like her, a healthy 20-year-old, will probably not get vaccinated until next year. 
Iwanejko expressed anxiety about the prospect of trying to return to USC next year without being vaccinated. 
“For the longest time, I thought I would just return in August to USC and get vaccinated there because I don’t think it’s going to be possible for me to get a vaccination in Poland this summer,” she said. “The fact that our government is not able to provide this for us is very inconvenient, especially because I don’t know if I can come back to the campus if I’m not vaccinated.”
At her State of the University address Monday, President Carol Folt announced that the University intended to require vaccines for the Fall 2021 semester. 
As USC students and their families across the country continue to get vaccinated and return to life that looks more normal, in many cases, international students face a much different reality. 
While Jacke watches her friends’ lives begin to return to normal in the U.S., she is still on lockdown in Germany, not allowed to see more than one person outside her household during the day or anyone after 9 p.m.
“When I see that people are hanging out in groups, maybe partying even, that definitely is very frustrating, because why shouldn’t I be?” Jacke said. 
Even as India currently struggles, Malhotra said that, overall, she thinks the country has done a good job in controlling the pandemic. While L.A. spent much of the winter in lockdown, India’s outbreak was under control, and Malhotra could live a relatively normal life.
“I don’t think I’m going to complain in that way,” Malhotra said. “I think that if you look at it from a distance, take last year into consideration and take death into consideration, I think the U.S. has made a much bigger mess of this than India has.”

Despite the pandemic preventing the class of 2021 from attending in person classes and activities, this year’s graduates have persevered. As Los Angeles’ vaccination rates increase and the county’s reopening continues, USC plans to host an in-person commencement this year with a limit of two guests per graduate. Out of state guests may be invited as long as they are fully vaccinated. 
Although the past year has made it a difficult year for many, Tianna Shaw-Wakeman said she hopes to continue as a positive source in the world. Shaw-Wakeman, a senior majoring in psychology with a progressive masters degree in social entrepreneurship, was selected as the valedictorian for the Class of 2021, and said she feels honored to be given the academic recognition, in part because it reflects her beliefs and the beliefs of her fellow students. 
“I spent … four and a half years completely just [delving] into trying to do what I could to make the community greener and more sustainable, and because of that, I feel like … I’ve been this vessel for the collective sustainable desires of students to shine through,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “I just feel very excited and happy to be able to represent students again in this final way.” 
Shaw-Wakeman, who graduated in December 2020, cares deeply about service and sustainability, and was involved in the Environmental Core activism organization and DivestSC, a project she co-founded. Along with other students and organizations, her work through DivestSC pushed USC to liquidate and freeze all investments in fossil fuels, which they committed to in February.
“With [co-founder] Nathaniel Hyman, we started the project in December of 2019, but really students had started it in the early 2010s. After over a year of working on that project together, USC made that announcement,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “Being able to delve into that advocacy work so deeply and to be able to work with the tons of students that we got to and the faculty members and the community, that was an honor.” 
Shaw-Wakeman is also currently working for a startup in Atlanta and taking part in the USC Presidential Working Group  on Sustainability and the Mayor’s Youth Council for Climate Action. In the future, she hopes to teach abroad through the Peace Corps. 
“I think seeds were planted when I was at USC,” said Shaw-Wakeman. “I will never not be an activist, I will never not be an advocate and I will never not be fighting in every way that I can to make environmental and social change for the better.”
Salutatorian Ashwin Bhumbla, a senior majoring in computer science and narrative studies, also believes in making the world a better place. 
“We’re the ones that are going to inherit the earth, so if we don’t … actively try to be aware of what’s going on around us [and] try to understand what’s going on around us, and then try — however we can, in whatever way — to make it better, then it just won’t happen,” Bhumbla said. 
A dedicated member of the Trojan Marching Band, Engineers Without Borders and Code the Change, Bhumbla hopes to bring about this positive change through his skills in computer science. 
“What I found is a lot of the tech innovation you see is actually just taking advantage of an under-legislated sector. We have old senators and lawmakers that don’t really understand tech,” said Bhumbla, who will be working at Microsoft after graduation. “My motivating factor is [that] I want to leave the world better than how I found it.” 
Jake Bubman, the other salutatorian, said he believes his calling is to be a lawyer. Bubman, a senior majoring in international relations and the global economy and Spanish, said he felt both honored and shocked to receive the academic honor. 
“I always thought to be one of those people — you have to start this crazy nonprofit and cure cancer and have a book deal,” Bubman said. “But looking back on the things that I’ve done in college, they feel a lot more [like] everyday real life now that I’ve actually done them. They don’t feel so otherworldly.” 
Bubman was involved with the SoCal Vocals a capella group and the Immigration Court Watch Program, where he served as a team lead. Although the Immigration Court Watch Program was cut short due to lack of funding, Bubman said, through the program, he was able to realize the powerful impact that he could have as a lawyer. 
“I saw [immigrants] who were just describing their experiences and why they were in the United States applying for asylum, and some of their stories were extremely impactful and really emotionally challenging to listen to,” Bubman said. “They were incredibly moving, and I’d say probably the part that changed me the most from watching that was seeing the degree to which the judges were unaffected by their stories.” 
After graduation, Bubman will attend law school at UCLA. He said he is interested in working on cases involving immigration and issues affecting the LGBTQ community as they hold a close place to his heart, being of Jewish and Cuban descent and a member of the LGBTQ community. 
Shaw-Wakeman, Bhumbla and Bubman were honored at USC’s 40th annual Academic Honors Convention mid-April for their high academic achievement, service and leadership. 
Like many students, Shaw-Wakeman has remained grateful for the opportunity to be part of USC and to have learned and grown in a stimulating environment, especially when USC was in person. 
“When you think about how few people in the world get to go to a college … I would get these awe moments where I would be sitting in a classroom and just think, for these four years, my only responsibility is to take in all of this information, and to grow and to learn and to help people and to exist in this world as a positive source,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “That is like a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful privilege. And so my main motivation has been to never take that privilege lightly.”

It’s that time of the year again — the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation women’s water polo tournament begins this weekend. Participating teams, including first-seeded USC, second-seeded UCLA, third-seeded Stanford, fourth-seeded Cal, fifth-seeded Arizona State, sixth-seeded Indiana and seventh-seeded San José State will face off at the Mona Plummer Aquatic Center for a coveted position in the NCAA tournament.
Fresh off their heartbreaking first loss of the season against UCLA Sunday, the Trojans are looking to recast their focus after earning a bye on the first day of MPSF competition Friday as the No. 1 seed. On Saturday, they’ll make their debut against the winner of Game 3, a matchup between Cal and Arizona State on Friday. 
USC traveled to Berkeley in March to face the Bears in a two-game showdown, with USC coming out on top both times with scores of 17-11 and 12-9. This was the start of the Trojans’ MPSF campaign, with redshirt seniors Maud Megens, utility, and Denise Mammolito, driver, collecting five goals apiece in the first matchup. 
The Trojans also had the opportunity to get some game experience against the Sun Devils, with two matches earlier in the season in Tempe and a two-game bout at home for Senior Day earlier this month. Freshman driver Julia Janov shined along with junior 2-meter Mireia Guiral, who won MPSF Player of the Week honors this past week for her perfect 4-for-4 shooting, four exclusions drawn and two steals against Arizona State.
With formidable defensive displays previously shown against both of these opponents, USC will then have to gear up for Sunday’s final, which could be against UCLA, SJSU, Stanford or Indiana, depending on who advances from that side of the bracket. 
The Trojans’ regular season closed out with their 23-game undefeated streak being snapped by UCLA. While this did not impact USC’s top-seeded position for the MPSF Tournament, it did reveal weaknesses in the team’s defense. 
USC’s first bout against the Bruins last Saturday saw just five of the Trojans’ 28 shots completed for goals, but the Trojans never trailed and recorded six steals to keep the ball on their offensive drives. On Sunday, a one-point UCLA lead in the first quarter turned into a two-point advantage by the half. A scoreless third for USC, along with an 8-point second half from the Bruins secured the Trojans’ 13-6 defeat.
In addition, UCLA posted a .448 shooting percentage in Sunday’s matchup, more than twice that of USC, in addition to capitalizing on a .500 powerplay percentage compared to USC’s .231.
These are adjustments that head coach Marko Pintaric is responsive to, considering the high energy of Saturday’s game and the rivalry between the two teams.
“A player’s like ‘We did great,’ you know, they want to get back [in the pool] so … it’s really hard to manage the shift anymore and emotions and, you know to to come next day and play consistent and win it,” Pintaric said.
Pintaric doesn’t see the loss as a hindrance to the Trojans’ performance in the upcoming MPSF Tournament, however.
“I’m just the manager — I’m just managing,” Pintaric said. “Credit to the girls. These girls are training like this, they really welcome the adversity and this is what sports is all about.”
The MPSF Tournament will be held from April 30 to May 2, with the Trojans first playing in Game 6 on Saturday, May 1 at 2:00 p.m. in the semifinals in single-elimination format. Following the tournament, the seeds for the NCAA Championship will be announced May 3.

One early afternoon in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., high school freshman Denise Mammolito tried out for her high school’s water polo team because her best friend wanted to try out. A few years later, Mammolito scored 11 goals to bring Rancho Cucamonga High School a 18-6 win in a tournament. Now, Mammolito sits at No. 12 on the USC women’s water polo career record scoring list. 
This was just a natural progression for the standout redshirt senior driver. 
“I actually started playing fairly late compared to most girls,” Mammolito said. “I started my freshman year of high school — my best friend wanted to try out, so I was like, ‘OK, I’ll do it with you.’ So I made the freshman team at my high school, and it ended up clicking.”
Mammolito’s father Louis relayed her growth as an athlete as something that stood out within their family of seven.
“Denise, always was kind of an all-in kid,” Louis said. “We have five, so you always try to coax them in a direction that you think they’ll be successful. She was always really natural, in the water. So her evolution was so quick and so short, it was amazing. And I was like, wow she throws really good. She can really get out of the water. From her freshman year to her sophomore year, she progressed a ton.”
Years later, just as the Trojans’ 2020 season was clicking, with the team holding a 12-1 record heading into more conference battles, the pandemic induced-cancellation of their matchup against Cal in mid-March sealed the fate of the season for good.
2020 was supposed to be the year that USC would avenge their loss to Stanford in the 2019 NCAA Championship final, to repeat their 2018 Championship win and for the six seniors poised to graduate to finish off their careers on a high note. 
Mammolito, being one of those seniors, waited for the NCAA to make an unprecedented decision on the fate of the season.
“I was very antsy for a long time because it was kind of difficult because we were waiting, and we knew that we needed to keep training but we never really had a set and secure date for where we were going to come back, and it felt like it just kept getting pushed back and pushed back,” Mammolito said. “I feel like it would have been easy to kind of just get down and stop training, but we knew that we needed to keep pushing.”
Eventually, Mammolito would head back to the pool with another friend — this time junior utility Bayley Weber. Neither teammate missed a step when the NCAA announced in late March 2020 that athletes could choose to play for an extra year of eligibility. 
“She got her fifth year, we decide[d], she decided to stay and I decided to move in with her,” Weber said. “So all of summer and the nine months we were out because of [the coronavirus], we trained together, which I think helped keep our bond.”
Though Louis and his wife could not see their daughter play in person for the past year, he describes it as a small price to pay in order for Denise to get that final year in the books.
“So the way I see it, it’s like you know me getting to see is like 10% of the 100%, and then the 90 is her getting to play and her getting to enjoy her playing and enjoy her teammates, enjoy her coaches and the competition, and [give us] the phone call after the game,” Louis said.
The dedication Mammolito gives to the program and to the sport itself may not always show up in her stat sheet, but it is recognized by the team regardless, according to head coach Marko Pintaric. 
“Her awareness and willingness to help, it’s always great,” Pintaric said, describing their recent bout against No. 2 Stanford at home. “She’s doing a lot of dirty work for us, and it’s not always registered in general stats … and she hustles for her teammates and it was great this game; she really carried the team on both ends.”
The Trojans’ two-game series against the Cardinal, often their most difficult opponent each season, earlier in April also brought a sense of nostalgia for Mammolito. While USC secured a 12-8 win in its first game against Stanford, the outcome of its second game against the Cardinal would not come as easily.
“Actually before that game in our meeting, [Coach] Pinta brought up how that was going to be the seniors’ last time playing Stanford at home,” Mammolito said. “So I think that going into that game, that was something that we all — we all really wanted to go out strong against them — just because we do have that really big rivalry.”
USC trailed by two in the fourth quarter, but Mammolito’s goal in overtime — her sixth in regulation and her tenth goal across the series — won the game and earned her her first-ever MPSF Player of the Week award. 
“So even though we were down by two going into the fourth quarter, like we knew that we were able to overcome that,” Mammolito said. “And I think that says a lot about our team, being able to overcome that adversity. But yeah, we just really wanted to win that game. So we could end our career against Stanford at USC on a high note.”
Weber added that the team was able to find Mammolito for those points because of her willingness to fill in at any position, which is something that will impact the program even after her last season.
“She’s willing to do whatever the team needs,” Weber said. “If the team needs her to guard she’ll guard … [when] the team needs her to set she’ll set … ultimately, … she’s always giving you 100% and anybody that comes into the program can see that. I think that’s a great thing.”
Pintaric agreed, acknowledging that the knowledge her teammates possess about her abilities, rather than Mammolito’s game awareness alone, made each and every drive count. Redshirt seniors driver Kelsey McIntosh and utility Maud Megens made some of those assists that would allow Mammolito to put the ball away. 
“It’s just her playing on both ends and [her saying], ‘I’m going to push, I’m going to be brave,’ [and stepping] into the right place at the right time,” Pintaric said. “And then again you have to give credit to her teammates as well to find her.”
Even with the bonds Mammolito has with her fellow seniors, she’s always looking out for the younger teammates that are paving their own way through the program.
“We all want to help each other in the water, and that’s how it is for the younger girls too,” Mammolito said. “We really want to see them succeed. And we also want to help develop them, so that when we do leave that they’re able to form these leadership roles and kind of these bigger roles up on the team that we have right now.”
Prior to No. 1 USC’s loss to No. 3 UCLA in Sunday’s regular season finale, the Trojan’s were undefeated and held a 17-0 record. Still, despite the loss, the team is poised to enter both the MPSF and NCAA tournament as an undisputed top seed, an accomplishment that owes a lot to Mammolito’s strong performances throughout the season.
However, before Mammolito leaves the Trojan ranks for good, she wants to end up on top — not for herself, but for the team she’s constantly rallying for.
“It’s got to be jumping in at the end of the season at UCLA,” Mammolito said. “Finishing off our careers on top, I really don’t think that there’s anything that can top [it], and I know for our senior class, we really really want to help the freshmen, sophomore, junior class win their first national championship. Because we weren’t able to do that in 2019, and then obviously the season ended in 2020. So we’ve waited a really long time for this opportunity. So yeah, I don’t think there’s anything that could top that.”

The coronavirus pandemic has completely reconstructed how we go about our lives. From the way we live and socialize with others to the way we learn, the pandemic has forced us to adapt to a new virtual environment. As universities like USC continue to adapt to both teaching and learning online, a huge toll weighs on the physical health of everyone involved. 
The general decline in wellness is more concerning as each day passes in this new virtual world.
Struggling with healthy sleep habits
A prominent issue many students are struggling with is maintaining good sleep habits. This is especially true for students who live in different time zones and are forced to sacrifice sleep for class. 
For Joon Chun, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, he’s grateful to professors who were considerate of his time zone difference when he was taking classes back home in South Korea. By switching to asynchronous classes and having extensions for homework, he has been able to adapt to virtual learning a bit easier.   
However, this is not always the case.
“There were a few classes in which they didn’t help us, even though we were in a different time zone. So, I had to sometimes stay up until 3 a.m., 4 a.m. attending lectures,” Chun said.  “Most of the time I tried to sleep as soon as I could, which ended up being like 5 a.m.” 
In trying to prioritize his health, Chun was forced to skip some of his classes to sleep. But sleep issues are not just a problem for students in different time zones.  
Even when students aren’t in a new time zone, it has become easier to take naps in between classes and stay up later at night. For Lianne Chu, a junior majoring in business administration, she finds herself sleeping more but inversely finds it harder to wake up early.
“At USC, I would wake up pretty consistently at like 7:15 a.m. every day. But now it’s hard to even wake up … at like 9 or even like 10 sometimes,” Chu said.
Laura Cox, an assistant professor of clinical occupational therapy, explains how virtual learning has inevitably increased the time students spend in front of a screen which has drastically impacted students’ sleep habits. The constant light input we get from our screens deceives our brains into thinking it is still daytime.
“It’s very confusing and can be dysregulating to our circadian clock. So we do need to put our devices to bed to allow our melatonin, which is our sleep hormone, to build up so we can sleep better,” Cox said. 
She recommends students put their devices down about 30 minutes before their own bedtime and try to create a separation between their virtual lives and their “real” ones. As an inconsistent sleep schedule is a leading cause of poor quality sleep, it is most important to have a consistent routine. Additionally, forcing yourself to go outside during the day can help to recalibrate your circadian rhythm and help you fall asleep easier at night. 
“[When] we’re getting less restorative sleep, we’re going to feel more tired and sleepy during the day,” Cox said. “You can kind of imagine this as if you’re inflicting jetlag upon yourself. It’s hard to adjust to a new clock, new time zone of wherever you’ve traveled, and therefore, you feel more tired.” 
Irregular sleep habits are often associated with poor health.  It puts people at an increased risk for metabolic health problems like obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and high blood sugars. For students, having poor sleep hygiene makes it a lot harder to focus in class and stay motivated. 
Nilay Desai, a sophomore majoring in human development and aging, noticed that before the pandemic, he was able to sleep by midnight at the latest, but now, he can’t seem to maintain a consistent sleep schedule.
“My sleep patterns have been absolutely wrecked,” Desai said. “I have not been able to sleep … regularly because it takes me like an hour, I’d say like after … I stop looking at a screen … to actually be able to go to sleep. So that’s been difficult, especially because like literally everything is online.”
Because of his inconsistent sleep schedule, Desai has been struggling with balancing physical and virtual learning as he feels fatigued nearly every day. 
“[I’m] fatigued pretty much all the time … but I can’t stop looking at a screen because then I won’t learn from any of my classes, so it’s all just one whole cycle of pain,” Desai said. 
Ashley Halle, associate professor of clinical occupational therapy, recommends separating virtual activities from other parts of life by creating a schedule, mindfully sticking to it and avoiding doing any work in bed. 
“You want to avoid doing work in bed and using electronics in your sleep space,” Halle said. “We want, really, that space to become associated with calm, restorative, restful sleep and relaxation.”
Not only will this improve sleep habits, but it will also improve ergonomics and avoid a plethora of other physical issues.
The consequences of poor ergonomics
Ergonomics deals with designing an environment or job to maximize safety and efficiency. Incorporating good ergonomic habits into our life can help reduce accidents, injuries and fatigue.
“Poor ergonomics does mean that there is an increase in muscle strain, imbalance and fatigue,” Halle said. “And so what happens is that, physically, if you continue with poor ergonomics, is that you’re going to experience injuries.” 
It is tempting and easy to just take classes from our warm, comfy beds or sofas, but this puts strains on the joints, increases fatigue and is terrible for the body. 
But poor ergonomics don’t just arise from taking classes in bed. Many students don’t have an optimal setup in their homes for taking classes that one would have at a university. 
“As students, we already sit down a lot, especially for virtual classes,” Chun said. “My desk is not the best desk — it’s pretty small and I’m a big person. So to crouch down and stare at my screen for like two hours a day, or two hours per class six hours a day. It’s not the best.” 
As Chun was already suffering from general back pain, virtual classes have intensified this problem. 
One way to relieve any soreness or improve ergonomics is to find ways to move and make small checks with posture. 
“A couple key points that I want to share: [ensure] that our feet are flat on the floor … under there, all our lower body joints should be at a 90-degree angle — that’s our hips, our knees, our ankles,” Cox said. “We want to think about stacking our ears over our shoulder, shoulders over our hips. And we want to let our arms relax at our sides and have our elbows be at 90 degrees.” 
Many think that having good ergonomics in your workspace requires expensive solutions, such as buying a new ergonomic chair, a laptop stand or getting a fancy standing desk. While all of these help to promote healthy posture, not all students have the resources or the proper learning environment to do this. Nonetheless, making small checks with posture or just getting in a small walk outside helps improve well-being. 
“If you can think creatively, there are some really inexpensive solutions to some common ergonomic problems that people can do,” Halle said. “Start with [the] core principles that are laid out: How should my body be sitting in this space? What is my current workplace, my current workstation, or desk or study space look like? And then, what modifications do I need to make to make it a little bit better?”
The ramifications of virtual learning 
“It’s hard to give a blanket prescription to all students. Everybody’s case is going to be a little bit different and what’s going to work for them and finding that balance,” Cox said. “But I think where I would start is by just stressing how important it is to be intentional.”
Whether this is spending five minutes to plan out your day, planning meals, taking a small walk down the street after your third class of the day or just finding ways to fit in breaks that don’t involve staring at a screen, the little things add up. All in all, it is important for students to try and escape their virtual bubbles as safely as they can. It is convenient to close Zoom and open up YouTube after class, but continuing to stare at the screen will only increase problems and add to eye strain.
The challenge of not being able to go outside as much has also limited how much exercise students are getting. Before the pandemic, even those who did not regularly go to the gym got their needed exercise naturally throughout the day by walking to class, to the store or to general meetings here and there. 
“Overall, we are just more sedentary where there’s not these natural breaks in our day,” Cox said. “All of this kind of natural movement, natural social interaction, that happens when we’re in person, it isn’t happening anymore, so then we have to manufacture it for ourselves. And so I think that’s been the tough part.”
Jessica Aftosmis, a sophomore majoring in aerospace engineering, would get close to 30,000 steps a day running around campus but now finds herself walking less than 5,000 steps daily. 
“Because your whole life is limited to one to two rooms when you’re learning virtually, there’s nowhere for you to go,” Aftosmis said. “When your physical health system is reliant upon you moving from place to place on foot and now you don’t have to move place to place on foot … you just lose that entire workout regime.” 
Nonetheless, it is important to try to get as much physical movement into the day as possible. Halle recommends just finding different ways to move. 
“I think physically, one of the best things that you can do is, while you’re learning in a remote context, is to move,” Halle said. “Even small movements can make a big difference for your body.”
Being isolated in our cyberspace bubbles has also been detrimental to students’ motivation and general mental health. Often, we separate mental health and physical health from each other when they are deeply interconnected. 
“Some of the concerns that people have about spending so much time attached to your computer, like the Zoom fatigue, it’s not just fatigue in terms of physical fatigue, but it’s also the mental and emotional fatigue,” Halle said. 
Zoom fatigue has impacted students across the country. It has been described as exhaustion or burnout associated with the endless use of virtual communication platforms. Current research shows that spending more time on video calls with minimal breaks increases Zoom fatigue. This comes from the lack of nonverbal cues and the challenges of interpreting body language through a screen. Theresa Machemer, a writer for National Geographic said that people start to overcompensate their own body language as they struggle to understand their colleagues’ moods.  
“I’ve definitely had issues with Zoom fatigue and just like trying to keep myself, I guess, motivated for classes,” Desai said. “It gets really difficult when all you do is look at a screen.” 
But the lack of motivation was not instantaneous. Rather, it is as if the pandemic and virtual learning are slowly sucking energy reserves.
“I don’t feel as productive, as motivated. I feel like I’m in this just this lull of like, I’m not going anywhere,” Chu said. “But there wasn’t like one day I woke up and I’m like, ‘Oh my god, I’m like not motivated at all, like, my mental health is gone’ … Day by day, it just kind of got worse.”
Halle emphasizes the need to step away from your screen whenever possible, not only for physical health but for mental health as well.
One question Halle suggests asking is, “what restorative activities can I do that will restore me physically, mentally and emotionally?”
The three variables go hand in hand with each other, and when they aren’t balanced, we begin to feel fatigued and lack motivation, Halle said. Everyone’s toolkit to restoring their wellbeing is different, but we should all have one to balance our energy. Chun recommends jump roping, while Desai has found running to be the most therapeutic. For Aftosmis, cutting off all electronic devices for a period of time each day to separate her personal life from work life has helped her most. Like Aftosmis, Chu is trying to be more mindful of taking a break each day.
“Just knowing when to take a step back and, and tell yourself ‘OK, I can afford an hour away from the screen’ … that gives me a clear mind to come back to whatever work I was working on originally,” Chu said. 
Whatever your tools may be, don’t let this new virtual world consume you.
“[Find] just one thing that you feel capable of and motivated about changing in your daily routine, whether it has to do with your sleep, physical activity, eating,” Cox said. “So if you want to start eating healthier, OK, like, what’s one thing you could do this week? … A student might need to start a little bit smaller, and that’s OK. You just need to meet [yourself] where [you’re] at and set an intention.”
If you are experiencing any symptoms of poor ergonomics, difficulty maintaining a solid sleep routine or are struggling with your overall well-being due to the pandemic, learn more about how to request a consultation with USC Occupational Therapy.

When I first tiptoed through the door of the Daily Trojan newsroom almost four years ago, unsure of my role at the student-run publication, let alone my purpose in the world, I was a very different person and the world was a very different place. 
The nervous freshman staff writer who idolized the upperclassmen on the editorial board wouldn’t have believed you if you told her she would rise through the ranks and ultimately take on the role of opinion editor — covering a presidential election, a global pandemic and the international reckoning on systemic anti-Blackness and radicalized oppression during one of the most tumultuous semesters to date. 
The Daily Trojan has been a big part of my life since the moment I began my academic career at USC and continues to be so as I approach graduation day. This column has been my safe haven, my sounding board and a meaningful vehicle of self-expression for two of those years. I never imagined I’d be sitting here writing my final DT article, my final installment of “The Afterword.” 
But here I am.
From all the University’s scandals (Operation Varsity Blues, the double life of former Keck School of Medicine dean Carmen Puliafito and the allegations against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall that put USC in the Los Angeles Police Department’s largest sex abuse investiation to date) to historical moments that shifted the sociopolitical fabric of the nation (Donald Trump’s divisive presidency, the coronavirus pandemic and the global takeover of pop culture by social media), the past four years have proven there is no more fascinating, important time to be a student journalist. 
That’s what drew me to the Daily Trojan in the first place — a desire to both write history and stand on the right side of it. I think that’s what motivates a lot of journalists. When I took on the role of opinion editor in the fall of 2020 at the height of the pandemic and amid intense, interwoven sociopolitical tensions, the job felt like a moral, ethical and intellectual responsibility. 
I became adept at parceling out contentious yet valuable perspectives from ignorant thinking, learned what it meant to ensure that underserved communities were represented by those who understood their lived experiences and found a way to keep the opinion section’s duty to foster a diversity of viewpoints alive while the world around us eroded into polarizing, restrictive partisanship.
It was this leadership position that helped me understand what it really means to have a voice. The ability to be articulate, succinct and provocative confers both power and responsibility. Journalism is about elucidating ideas, protecting them from erasure and enabling others to use these ideas in ways that help them reconcile their existence with a world notorious for its incongruence. 
I am honored to have had the opportunity to lead this charge and to die on the hills of tolerance, disruption and radical reform publicly and proudly. I would die on each of those hills over and over again for as long as it takes to enact substantive change and so would the rest of the Daily Trojan newsroom. That, not impersonal objectivity, is what journalism is about: people who use the unwavering power of words to fuel critical thought and challenge the status quo.
The freedom of the press should be non-negotiable for any democratic society, but in the age of clickbait and fake news, enough circulation can turn lies into half-truths dispeled through the pulse of the nation at an exponential rate. The integrity of modern journalism has been and continues to be under scrutiny and rightfully so: The lines delineating what is opinion, what is fact and what is objectivity have become increasingly blurred. 
As I pass along the torch to the next opinion editor, the next opinion columnist, the next nervous freshman staff writer who doesn’t yet know how important their work will be, the message I want to send is that good journalism still matters and still works. Good journalism is the 10-minute video taken by 17-year-old Daniella Frazier of George Floyd’s death that led to his murderer’s conviction on all three charges last week. Good journalism is equally the months spent by Daily Trojan reporters investigating the University student body’s spike in overdoses and suicides. Good journalism is equally still a newsroom’s ability to distinguish controversial opinions from discriminatory ones and to act on this distinction accordingly. 
Good journalism cannot and should not always be about impartiality or neutrality. Good journalism is not about safekeeping devil’s advocacy or allowing human rights issues to be relegated to elitist academic debate by those who will never be affected by them. Good journalism is about doing your due diligence to read between the lines, find the voices that have been historically and systemically silenced, and amplify them. 
Good journalism is about holding a mirror up to the world and asking people to peer into it, no matter how ugly what looks back at them might be.
Maya Angelou said: “There’s a world of difference between truth and facts. Facts can obscure truth.” While both are necessary to credible journalism, only truth lends itself to good journalism. 
It is my fundamental belief that using your voice to challenge mechanisms of injustice with empathy and dexterity is oftentimes the most effective vehicle for progress. In my four years at USC, I’ve witnessed time and time again the positive impact good journalism can have on policy and culture alike. I’ve witnessed the consequences bad journalism can have on these same domains just as much, if not more. 
But that is all the more reason to stand behind good journalism, not a sign to capitulate. Good journalism may be under attack but it is not dying — it is surviving, screaming louder than ever, and it has a home on USC’s campus in the form of the Daily Trojan. 
I want to shout out my editors-in-chief, Natalie Oganesyan and Raymond Rapada, for being such excellent ambassadors of the “good journalism” I mention here. Your leadership has helped this newspaper become a megaphone for injustice with staying power that will be felt long after you leave the newsroom. I want to shout out Angie Orellana Hernandez for doing the taxing work of checking privilege and bias both in the paper and behind the scenes. I want to shout out Lauren Mattice and Sophie Ceniza for giving me the confidence to lead the opinion section and to run stories that really mattered. I want to shout out all thirty of my talented opinion writers for exceeding my expectations every day: you are good journalism. 
I am going to law school next year and will be leaving journalism behind, but a piece of me will always live in the Daily Trojan. Thanks, DT, for all the things you’ve taught me.

She knew she had made a mistake. 
It was Yoo Lee’s first day during her second year at the Otis College of Art and Design in Los Angeles and her enrollment should’ve felt like a grand relief of triumph and progress. After all, Yoo had grown up wanting to be a fashion designer, especially after seeing Christian Dior’s costume exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City when she was 10 years old.
But on that first day, her disillusionment with fashion became clear. This realization did not stem from the labor of the craft but rather the tone of the industry.
“As much as I love fashion, it’s very much commerce, and there’s a lot of competition and it’s not very collaborative,” Yoo, a graduate student studying animation and digital arts (who is currently on a year of leave), told the Daily Trojan. “There’s a lot of cattiness that comes with fashion. It was very much like that in the classroom. And I thought, ‘Oh, this isn’t going to be great.’”
Her options to change course were limited, but she attempted anyways, looking to transfer into environmental or furniture design. Yoo’s father, however, wanted her to make “an independent living after graduation.” 
He gave her an ultimatum: go back to Korea and do whatever she wanted or stay in Los Angeles and study fashion. Yoo chose the latter.
A GIFT OF REMEMBRANCE
Yoo had made her mark in the fashion world, spending 20 years in the industry and even starting her own company, Saja, making garments right out of her living room. 
But Yoo had fallen out of touch with fashion, noting that “as somebody who is creative, it wasn’t enough.” When she gave birth to her daughter Sky, Yoo found herself with a lot of emotions that she wanted to express. 
“It wasn’t easy for me to become a mother. I lost two kids on the way, so it was a very profound moment for me like seeing her face,” Yoo said. “Because I didn’t grow up in America, I didn’t know any lullabies and so I couldn’t sing to her, but I made up this rhyme, and I wanted to preserve it so when she grew up she would remember me [and] remember this moment.”
Yoo didn’t know how to animate in 3D or 2D, so she relied on what she already knew from fashion: the art of breathing life into cloth, clay, buttons and twine, otherwise known as puppet fabricating.
For her very first stop motion film, Yoo tailored a doll in her daughter’s likeness. She reached out to a friend who had experience in musical composition and asked him to create a song for the film and record Sky singing it. The result ended up being a two minute music video dubbed “Sun Went Down, Moon Came Up.”
The creation of the video was the most fun Yoo has ever had, she said. Her friends suggested she learn Dragonframe, a stop motion animation software. So, she did and eventually closed her fashion studio for six months to focus on animation.
The choice to focus on stop motion animation, specifically, came from her love of texture. It’s a feeling she can’t get from 3D or 2D animation, Yoo said, that while the art form is gorgeous, she doesn’t see herself working at a computer all day.
“I’m a tactile person — I love texture, I love visuals,” Yoo said. “The fact that you get to hold your animation in your hand and the sets in front of you … you just fall in love. And it’s kind of creepy, but they’re no longer puppets. They really become your real characters. They have their own personalities for the duration of animation.”
Yoo went on to do two more music videos. One of them was an ABC song that has gained over 6 million views on YouTube and the other was a video about the tooth fairy to comfort children as they lost their baby teeth.
But after she had recorded a total of three music videos, Yoo found herself at a crossroad. She could either take up stop motion as a very expensive hobby or pursue her craft as an animator.
She committed to learning the work, applying to the School of Cinematic Arts’ John C. Hench Division of Animation and Digital Arts program a week before the deadline. 
A TEST SURPASSED
At first, Yoo suffered. She was new to learning the fundamentals of animation and would often leave USC at around 2 a.m., scarcely seeing her family. Her husband and daughter cheered her on, allowing her to power through the hardship. 
Yoo’s work ethic and ability to graciously learn from her mistakes was something professors Michael Patterson and Candace Reckinger recognized in her. 
“She came in from the fashion business, which was really unique for one of our students to come in from another career,” Patterson said. “And she was really open to learning and learning to adapt her skills in design and visual design to animation and stop motion because she was very craft oriented.”
Yoo was in Reckinger’s second year animation course when she developed the idea for a short film based on Alba, her neighbor back in New Jersey. Yoo had put off animating it until she felt like she was up to par with her skills, but the moment she brought the film to fruition, it “changed everything” for her.
The film, titled “A Poem by Alba,” is about an elderly woman living in isolation. It was inspired by Yoo’s own feelings of sadness of not being able to visit her parents in South Korea because of coronavirus restrictions.
“I know, when I watched it reminded me of my mother when she was older. And the sense of humor too, I think is what makes it very real, rather just sentimental,” Reckinger said, describing the film. “I like the way she tweaked this very poignant story in check with a sense of humor. And in that she appreciated Alba with other quirks and oddities and roughness, and she presented her as she was.”
Jarrod Chatham, a graduate student studying animation and digital arts, helped Yoo with digital compositing for “Alba,” which entails working with blue and green screens and layering different elements unto the film. For Chatham, Yoo’s ability to work with her characters and bring depth to them is something that stands out to him about her, noting that her connection with the characters makes the story richer.
“These people are not perfect. They’re deeply flawed people. They’re also disadvantaged people, and she wants to give a voice to these people,” Chatham said. “She wants to create characters about them, so people in the future can learn about them to hear their stories. And I think, for me, it’s a very selfless act.”
‘PRECIOUSNESS OF TIME’
Yoo lives by one rule: Live life with no regrets. 
“I learned a lot from dogs because when you love dogs so much, you get to know the preciousness of time because they don’t live long, and you know, they love you so much in a short time,” Yoo said. “So I really appreciate time, so I always think about context in terms of my deathbed, and I say, ‘Is this something I’m going to regret if I don’t go for that I should have done?’ and if the answer is yes, I always go for it. There’s no question about it.”
At the beginning of the interview, Yoo said she wanted to tell others out there that it is not too late to start something new. 
“I want people to know that it’s not impossible, if people have passion for something,” Yoo said. “I did it in my late 40s, so anybody can do it.”
And Yoo is on her path to further realize her dreams. The stop motion animator is now embarking on a new journey as she prepares her upcoming stop motion project with a LAIKA fellowship from Film Independent’s Project Involve program.
“Through this grant I get to work with all the Film Independent fellows, and I looked at their bio and their IMDb, and I’m flabbergasted,” Yoo said. “But I also know that I’m equal amongst them, and so it’s great, and they accept me as one of them. I think that anything is possible, it’s just your mindset. So that’s what I would tell anyone — it’s never too late to go after it.”

Unfortunately, a Log Cabin Republican is not a lumberjack. 
Formed in the late 1970s, the Log Cabin Republicans is a grassroots organization of dedicated LGBTQ+ Republicans working with the Republican party to “achieve a more inclusive GOP” and champion equality for LGBTQ+ Americans. In other words, Log Cabin Republicans want to reform the political party from the inside. 
Most would assume that someone who is gay would identify with political parties that don’t seek to overturn marriage equality, so Log Cabin Republicans indeed depart from the norm. However, this paradigm of “reform from the inside” is far from unfamiliar. While ostensibly advocating for civil rights, these efforts rarely function as effective methods of progress. Whether we are discussing police reform, drug reform or even Greek life reform, progress requires far more than coalitions of people simultaneously endorsing and “reforming” institutions that are structurally oppressive. 
For instance, LGBTQ+ equality does not only involve white people — it involves all racial groups and genders. I can take a wild guess that a majority of people who identify as a “Log Cabin Republican’’ are white, straight-passing men. But it makes sense, considering white gay men have and always will benefit the most when it comes to LGBTQ+ reform. 
Not to mention the fact that our society still dichotomizes gay people into two categories — those who are “straight-passing” and those who are flamboyant; those who are acceptable and those who are not. Heterosexual men are suddenly praised for wearing dresses and skirts while queer people have been historically murdered for it. A “masculine,” straight-passing ex-Bachelor comes out as gay and Netflix immediately offers him a show, despite the fact that his ex-girlfriend accused him of harassment. 
This highlights how certain marginalized identities don’t void dominant ones. Being a gay man doesn’t elude one from misogyny. Being a gay man doesn’t elude one from harmful platforms passed by the Republican party that affect other marginalized communities. How can one fight for LGBTQ+ inequality in the same party that strips reproductive rights from women, subjects transgender children to genital examinations and refuses to condemn white supremacy, choosing to instead protect the perpetrators of such platforms? In this case, “reform from the inside” completely ignores intersectionality. 
But the “reform from the inside” hoax does not only apply to Log Cabin Republicanism. When we say “ACAB,” we refer to the culture of police and the “blue wall of silence.” In a rare incident, the blue wall was broken in the Derek Chauvin trial when fellow police officers testified against him. That was an exception. 
Police officers are expected to cover for each other in a corrupt system that torments marginalized communities and protects white communities. Whistleblowers have no choice but to criticize it from outside the institution because they resign — or they are marginalized, demoted or fired. For example, back in 2006, Buffalo Police Department Officer Cariol Horne arrived at a scene to find a fellow officer choking a Black man. While other cops stood by, she urged him to stop until she eventually pulled her colleague’s arm from around the suspect’s neck. In retaliation, Horne’s colleague punched her in the face and damaged her teeth. As a result, Horne was fired for “obstructing justice” while her colleague walked away without punishment. 
Meanwhile, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo received backlash after he commented that police reform won’t happen until white kids start getting killed. He’s right — people do not care about reform until the issue finally impacts the majority. The same thing happened with the surge of support for marijuana legalization. Once white people began to cultivate and profit off it, drug reform was suddenly popular. Again, this shows how reform will not happen from the inside, but as of now, it happens when the majority is personally affected by the issue at hand.  
And if we want to talk about an institution especially close to USC students, we can talk about efforts to reform Greek life. Fraternities and sororities have always existed as vehicles of racism, homophobia, elitism and misogyny. They contain engrained power hierarchies that perpetuate sexism, particularly sexual assault on college campuses. For example, sororities are not allowed to throw parties and also ban alcohol in the house. 
Students insist on staying in Greek life to combat their systemic issues from the inside. However, fraternities have their own culture that makes reform from the inside not feasible. “Bro culture” incentivizes men to protect their fraternity brothers after undergoing dangerous hazing rituals — their own blue wall of silence. 
So, how can one be part of a fraternity and advocate for zero tolerance sexual assault policies  when fraternity men are three times more likely to commit rape than non-Greek peers? This statistic is merely the result of the structural set-up of fraternity culture that bestows privilege to the already-privileged, where insufficient Title IX policies allow entitled men to evade accountability. Reforming it would involve upturning this entire framework, which simply cannot be done by a few fish that swim against the current. 
As long as Greek life functions as a profit vessel for universities, it will not be reformed to become more accessible and less elitist. It prioritizes rich, white students and alumni who provide hefty donations to their alma mater. In this case, we have to rely on rich, white alumni for reform, hoping they won’t retaliate against policy changes by cutting their university donations. Again, reform and abolition do not occur until the majority deems it appropriate for their own benefit, or the marginalized group retaliates against their own oppression.
But since reform is ineffective from the inside, how can we actually reform? In this dilemma, it almost feels like we can’t push for progress because the oppressor draws boundaries for what is considered acceptable and unacceptable protest. 
For instance, Democrats and Republicans alike have condemned looting and rioting in response to the murders of Black people at the hands of the police. But Rep. Maxine Waters departed from the status quo when commenting on the awaited Derek Chauvin trial verdict. She insisted that if the verdict was not guilty, “We’ve got to stay on the street. We get more active, we’ve got to get more confrontational.” 
Of course, she was ambushed by the same people who condoned Donald Trump’s violence-inciting remarks toward white supremacists back in January, because there is such a thing as acceptable violence for “progress.” The American Revolution was “acceptable,” as was Christopher Columbus’ genocide; but once people destroy replaceable property because the police murder another irreplaceable life, violence is suddenly a no-go. 
The discussion about “reform from the inside” obviously extends beyond Log Cabin Republicans, but as a concept, it speaks to how skewed our perceptions of justice have become and how reform cannot replace abolition. It’s easy enough to call for monumental change from inherently oppressive systems of power; acting on it is a completely different story.

Is it just me, or have the social media powers-that-be gotten together for their monthly Illuminati-style meeting and decided, “Yes. OK. We are all in agreement: commence swimsuit advertising.”
For the past few weeks, every time I open Instagram, or literally any website, it’s been “Here are images of perfectly toned muscular women; our bikinis will make you look like this!” 
And as a chronically ill woman, I have to say, that shit has really been getting to me.
As someone with many health issues, my body is already a complex, delicate masterpiece. Some might say like a Picasso, and to that, I would not argue.
To that end, like a great work of art does, it’s taken many moons to find the perfect balance of color and uniqueness to my composition — my color being the cocktail of multi-colored pills I take four times a day, and my uniqueness being the intended, and many unintended, side effects of that cocktail. 
Recently, one of those unintended side effects for me was weight gain, which, being a woman, felt like a perfect patriarchal one-two punch to the boob. 
For some context, I grew up tall, thin, and being told, “Are you eating enough?” or “Get some meat on those bones.” Then there were the really clever and totally original nicknames: stick bug, baby giraffe, Gumby and my personal favorite, pencil. That one really impressed me. 
Throw in coming of age during the renaissance that is Victoria’s Secret, and the holy pinnacle that was the VS Fashion Show, my little adolescent mind was very confused. On the one hand, the media I was inadvertently consuming as a kid was praising me for being tall, thin and let’s not forget white, but on the other hand, the girls at school teased me for being flat chested, having bony elbows, and looking more like Wilt from “Foster’s Home for Imaginary Friends” than a teenage girl.
Needless to say, when I became chronically ill and unintentionally lost 20 pounds, I knew it was a sign that my body was really sick and battling something, but the kid in me who grew up drinking from the fire hose of early 2000s beauty standards was confused. (And no, I’m not going down the rabbit hole of “It’s ingrained in you because of the patriarchy.” I only have so much energy, and we have a word count honey.)
During my fourth hospitalization of 2020, I was desperate, and my family and doctors were seriously concerned. I needed to gain weight fast. My fabulous internist prescribed me a medication that was two-for-one: It would jumpstart my appetite and help with my insomnia. 
Overnight, I had an appetite again. In a few weeks, I’d gained back 10 pounds and was finally able to participate in physical therapy. Sleeping better allowed me to exercise, be upright and participate in activities of daily living. 
However, after two months on that medication, my weight gain didn’t stop. Suddenly, I had gained over the weight I’d lived at 90% of my life, and I didn’t know how to handle it. The weight gain accelerated past what I was mentally prepared for. 
The catch was I couldn’t stop this medication. It was helping my GI issues and my insomnia so much that I was terrified to come off it only to watch the pendulum swing hard in the wrong direction again. I was stuck on a medication that had positive health benefits but was negatively affecting my body confidence. Despite exercising and improving my physical strength, I was still unable to lose the excess weight this medication retained. 
This dilemma did a real number on my mental health for a long time. I felt stuck in a feedback loop, constantly asking myself: Do I stop the medication literally helping me sleep just to lose a few pounds? Why am I so caught up on having a little extra fat on me when my physical strength is finally coming back? And the hardest one to grapple with: Why am I having such a hard time loving myself now that I’m a little heavier than I’ve ever been?
To be honest, it’s been almost a year since starting that medication, and I am here to report that 1) I’m still on that medication and 2) I still don’t have answers. 
However, I have made progress on how to live with these unanswered questions. 
First, I’ve concluded that if there were no reflective surfaces left on planet Earth, and I was forced to get quiet with my mind and body, would I feel capable and courageous regardless of my physical appearance? Focusing on that question rather than what I see in the mirror has really helped. 
Second, I’ve realized that because my chronic health conditions already place me in such a state of chaos, experiencing a loss of control over my physical appearance as a result of illness, and now medication side effects, was especially difficult. It was just one more thing lost to the unpredictable nature of chronic illnesses and that took some time to grieve. After a while, I found some peace accepting my physical appearance in its current state because my body was healing on the inside.
Third, I recognize I’m not diving deep into the entire conversation on the body positivity/body acceptance/body neutrality movement. That’s intentional. I am still educating myself in those movements and finding out how they may or may not work for me. But I’ve taken comfort in knowing others are navigating the world of body confidence too, regardless if they’re chronically ill.
Lastly, and most importantly, I’ve realized all this fluctuation with my weight and physical appearance because of my health conditions presents an opportunity to shift attention away from my physical self and towards other parts of myself that make me who I am. 
I’ve realized I don’t have to make peace with my physical appearance because it’s a work in progress, as are my mind and spirit. I’m learning to balance taking care of myself while simultaneously learning that my worth is rooted in places outside of how I look. 
Yes of course, I still poke, pinch and squish. But I know my worth is rooted in my obnoxiously loud laugh, my listening skills, my ability to be a good friend, the sexiest dancer, a dedicated student and so much more. Not in what the scale reads or mirror reflects.

Up until my early teenage years, I held a green card. I remember seeing the card itself and not thinking very much about it. All in all, it was true to its name; the green coloring was apparent as my photo and personal information were cast in a pronounced green hue. It was something kept handy in my mother’s wallet but was never really taken out.
I remember the minute details of my brushes with the immigration system most vividly. When my passport was close to its expiry date, my permanent resident status meant that I would need to wait for hours outside the Philippine embassy with my mother. It meant that I had to check a different box occasionally or wait in a separate line at the airport.
I was too young to be consciously aware of the privilege that a card had afforded me or the way in which the immigration system favored me for nothing more than sheer chance. 
The system itself is as old as the nation. Built for the purpose of exclusion and control, the United States immigration system is one that continues to criminalize entire peoples on the basis of race, class and world standing. U.S. exceptionalism and white supremacy have acted as the foundation of U.S. immigration for far too long. The notion that anyone is “illegal” is despicable and should be despicable to those that back legislation written for the purpose of dehumanizing what is foreign. 
Last Monday, U.S. immigration agencies were advised to forgo the term “illegal alien” under presidential order. The term “alien” in the U.S. legal system was made a fixture by George Washington’s Naturalization Act in 1790. Since then, we have maintained the oppressive rhetoric, carrying the practice through to the 21st century. 
The difference in labeling between my “permanent resident” status and the phraseology afforded to those without documentation does not escape me. It should not escape any of us that there are people, many of which are children, throughout the nation who are simply guilty in the eyes of the law for existing in the space they find themselves in. 
Terminology is the tip of the metaphorical iceberg. 
I may not have been born in this country, but I was raised knowing the tenets of what is afforded to all people on the basis of their valued human life. What is unalienable — life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness — hangs in the balance for our undocumented immigrants, and it has only recently become very clear to me why. 
As a citizen, pre-law student and someone who has come face to face with the immigration system, the depth of my concern is far-reaching for the sickness that plagues modern day immigration. 
Attorney and professor Alina Das identifies the roots of racial discrimination and criminalization within the immigration system. Her work highlights that the system itself “has thus long been about power” and “oppression.” 
Undocumented immigrants deserve more. Defenders of restrictive immigration falsely contend that immigrants are a drain on U.S. resources. In past years, the vision of what will “make America great” has depicted a version of the U.S. that is limiting of immigration and punishing of its undocumented immigrants. Human life has become politicized in a manner that is complicit in countless Due Process clause violations. 
As a University and as a community, we know that the vibrancy of our culture and the strength of our workforce is dependent on its immigrant men and women. In times of crisis like the one we face now, immigrants comprise a significant number of the essential workforce. 
Just as well, undocumented children deserve more. I have spent hours poring over texts that stipulate protections for our nation’s children. I think of my three younger sisters and am continuously reminded of why we protect the childhood experience. To know that there are children standing alone in immigration proceedings should deeply concern us all. 
I know my rights because I have studied them with the motivation of knowing their history. My rights and the ill-fitting protections for undocumented immigrants are not the same, and it is arguably meant to be this way as a tactic for maintaining control. Undocumented immigrants are not guaranteed counsel in removal proceedings; furthermore, they are not guaranteed an appearance before a judge in expedited proceedings. 
Both the justice system and immigration system have failed immigrant communities in being unable to ensure the vital protections which make the U.S. legal system theoretically fair. They deserve more. 
As human beings, vital members of society and contributors to their communities, undocumented immigrants deserve an immigration system that acknowledges their inherent rights. 
In expanding discussions of equality and social justice, the shortcomings of the immigration system need to be addressed. As a young immigrant in the U.S., I continue to hold out hope that we’ll realize a nation’s greatness is determined by how it treats the most vulnerable, not in its capacity to strong-arm what it fears.

Since this is my final installment for this spring, it’s only fitting to discuss something that I’ve been thinking about all semester — capitalism. In my last column, I made the argument that capitalism determines how we define sustainability, and what level of environmental degradation we deem tolerable. Consequently, I’d argue that capitalism is not only not conducive to sustainability, but further perpetuates inequalities that lead to increased environmental degradation.
The capitalist system encourages marketplace competition while maximizing efficiency of production and allocation of resources. However, it can also lead to economic instability, monopolies and short-term fixes to maximize profits. Which brings me to the question that I’ve been thinking about all semester — capitalism is undeniably effective, but can it be at all environmentally ethical?
The basic premise is simple. The higher the rate of consumption, the more demand for products. This creates thriving businesses but also increased exploitation of natural resources and laborers around the world. Therefore, our culture of consumerism is inherently linked to the capitalist system. 
Under a capitalist system, production typically ignores negative externalities that occur, including pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Competing in an open market is all about cutting costs to keep up with competitors, without accounting for the future of finite resources. Short-term profits win out over long-term sustainability, and in the case of nonrenewable resources, a region is left bearing the brunt of the impact long after the profitable goods have been extracted.
The benefits of global economic growth are never evenly distributed. While industry growth doesn’t immediately indicate environmental destruction, there is a strong correlation between a nation’s wealth and its environmental performance. Developing countries often don’t have the means to invest in renewable forms of energy, sustainable production processes and waste management, which leads to them becoming both the world’s greatest producers and polluters. Without international investment, countries that lack initial resources only contribute to digging ourselves in a deeper, climate change-induced grave.
Environmental accountability is placed upon the consumer under a capitalist system. Options for a less impacting lifestyle are buried deep under greenwashed labels, misinformation about manufacturing and empty promises. But when you can barely afford the rising costs of living as it is, being green isn’t at the top of your priority list. 
Pursuing a greener lifestyle is in itself a privilege of the wealthy. Those with wealth have access to education that teaches them to think critically about the global environmental system and the downfalls of capitalism. In that same vein, having the disposable income to make more environmentally friendly purchases, invest in renewable energy and visit national parks to cultivate personal appreciation for the environment are all privileges bestowed upon the upper class. 
More sustainable products undoubtedly cost more than their counterparts; less competition and more ethically-sourced materials result in an exclusive, expensive product. The system benefits those who have the money to make these choices, and it’s much easier for the wealthy to maintain a more environmentally-conscious lifestyle. 
People often resort to cheap fixes like fast fashion, less gas-efficient vehicles or unsustainably-sourced food because they simply don’t have the disposable income to invest in the short term to save in the long term. For many, there isn’t a choice at all — unsustainable businesses are able to exploit those in the most dire states of poverty, keeping themselves afloat because their customers have no cheap alternative. 
A well-read consumer might argue that I’m wrong — there are over 3,500 companies worldwide that have achieved B Corporation status, meeting social and environmental standards while balancing profit and purpose. The certification implies that there is a cornerstone of compromise between capitalism and social innovation. 
However, B Corp standards are not legally enforceable, and certification is virtually nothing more than a self-assessment. Even brands that have developed a reputation for activism have been found to be shallow proponents of advocacy. 
Ben and Jerry’s, certified B Corp, is known for its support of the progressive agenda. Upon its founding, the company only sold shares to Vermont citizens, investing capital straight back into the community where it was founded. In 2000, it was bought by Unilever, a multinational corporation known for unsustainable palm oil production and poor treatment of employees. Ben and Jerry’s’ message of social responsibility is directly at odds with the actions of its parent company, thus proving that within the capitalist system, doing good for the community always comes second to doing well as a company. 
While even an environmentally ethical economy will have its defectors, improvement begins with investment in human capital — living conditions, education and marketable skills. Instead of promoting concepts like ethical consumption, we must make strides towards real equity. Assigning monetary values to ongoing acts of environmental and human exploitation is no quick fix, but will be the basis of a changing attitude toward accounting for negative externalities.
Capitalism is the antithesis of ethical behavior, as it fails to take into account the needs of humans and natural ecosystems. When the going gets tough, the priorities of the triple bottom line — people, planet and profit — go straight out the window. Turning a profit comes first, despite the many other problems perpetuated. Unchecked capitalism creates a positive feedback loop, oppressing the vulnerable, bolstering the wealthy and accepting the widespread environmental damage that comes along with unhampered economic growth. 
While it may seem that the free market and governmental regulations are juxtaposed, establishing greater company accountability and social responsibility is necessary. Intervention by non-market forces is key in revamping our current system for the long haul. Based on our current climate trajectory, there will be no need to drive profit if there are no consumers to supply. Systemic change in our economic system is achievable and possibly the only chance we have at combating human-induced environmental degradation.
If there’s any message I can leave you with, it’s that thinking critically about our existing systems is never a bad thing. Capitalism is more than just an economic philosophy, it’s a foundation upon which our country and many others were founded. As insurmountable as it may seem, we must address and dismantle the assumptions about the functionality of our economy.

The Oscar’s roll around every spring leaving either abundant confusion or unlimited disappointment. However, this year the Academy Awards seemed to realize a few of their common missteps. 
On April 25, the in-person 93rd Academy Awards were held in two in-person locations: the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood and Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. Participants from abroad celebrated in London and Paris, but there was no zoom-in option for nominees. 
Not only did the awards include a few historic moments, the nominations caught the attention of many as well. 
The Oscars historically are heavily criticized for their lack of female director nominations, but this year both Emerald Fennell and Chloé Zhao were nominated. It was the first time two women were nominated in the directing category. 
Zhao won best director, making her the first Chinese woman and the first woman of color to win the award. Eventually, “Nomadland,” the film she directed and was nominated for, took home the Oscar for best picture as well. 
Steven Yeun, star of “Minari,” was the first Asian American actor to be nominated for Best Actor, and Riz Ahmed of “Sound of Metal” was the first Muslim to be nominated in the same category. Surprisingly, or depending on your perspective, unsurprisingly, the lead actor prize went to Anthony Hopkins for “The Father.”
The win came as an upset to many considering the late Chadwick Boseman’s nomination for lead Actor. The show’s producers shuffled the order of awards to the announcement of lead actor category’s winner to last. In many minds, people believed this would mean the award would go to Boseman since he had already won the Golden Globe, and finishing the Oscars by honoring Boseman posthumously would’ve been an emotional end to the night’s program. 
Instead, the ceremony chose to honor him by hiring an artist, Andre Oshea, to make a digital artwork redeemable by an NFT (non-fungible token). 
Twitter reacted as Twitter does, to Hopkins’ win, expressing anger and saying the Oscars were milking Boseman’s death for viewers. 
Boseman’s loss for his role in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” did not leave the movie empty-handed. Hairstylists Mia Neal and Jamika Wilson and makeup artist Sergio Lopez-Riveria won an Oscar in the makeup and hair category. Neal and Wilson are the first Black women to win this award. 
Fennell took home best original screenplay for “Promising Young Woman,” and Yuh-Jung Youn took home the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in Minari, making her the first Korean and second Asian woman to win in the category. 
The Oscars moved a few mountains this year — but the world of entertainment must now wait with bated breath to see if this truly means a change in Hollywood.

As we head into the final column of “The Medic,” I wanted to note how illuminating this experience was writing these biweekly pieces, as it uncovered how all our formidable sports organizations and leagues like the NBA, NFL and NCAA truly operate. 
What I mean by this is how prepared these organizations were to manage the challenging hurdle of the pandemic as well as how they valued science and the safety of their players and staff. Therefore, in this last column of the semester, I intend to look back on how our sports organizations handled the pandemic and what this shows about them. 
To begin, I will start with what I felt were the best efforts of playing sports in the pandemic, which were with the NBA and WNBA. Both leagues implemented a bubble system, where players tested before entering the bubble to make sure they didn’t contract the coronavirus and were then sent to their respective bubbles in Florida. Once there, they followed daily testing and strict restrictions to keep everyone safe. 
This led to some iconic moments, including when Sacramento Kings forward Richaun Holmes was forced to quarantine for 10 days again because he picked up a Postmates order which crossed the NBA bubble. 
Even in more critical moments, we saw how the WNBA postponed the semifinal game of the Seattle Storm and Minnesota Lynx because of inconclusive coronavirus test results from the players on the Storm. The decisive decision making from both of the basketball leagues’ officials demonstrated how sports can operate smoothly and with caution despite the pandemic. 
Nevertheless, the NBA has gotten more relaxed with its precautions for the 2020-21 season, which caused an influx of cases. 
I will also say that it is important to note that the NHL should be applauded as well because of their successful dual bubble system in the Canadian cities of Edmonton and Toronto, where there were not many hiccups because of the strict adherence to protocols. 
Overall, strong work by all three leagues. 
Next, I want to discuss the conundrum and disarray we saw with the NFL. Our professional football league had the most time to prepare for the pandemic since their season already ended by the time the pandemic started getting worse in the United States in March. 
At first, the NFL made a good move by having their 2020 draft virtually where prospective players could stay at home, but when it came to the actual season, their mistakes began to show. Specifically, the number of postponed and rescheduled games hurt the quality of the season, which could have been mitigated if proper measures had taken place to contain the virus. 
The NFL gave a lot of authority to teams to make sure their team is safe rather than forcing everyone to be in some type of bubble, which led to their many cases of the coronavirus. 
A time that highlighted how much the NFL wanted the games to play despite clear hazards was when the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs were supposed to play on Sunday, Oct. 4, and the game got postponed due to both Patriots quarterback Cam Newton and Chiefs backup quarterback Jordan Ta’amu testing positive. It ended up getting rescheduled to the next day on Monday since there were no additional positive tests on either team. 
However, the problem with that thinking, as I have mentioned numerous times before, is that the virus appears at different times depending on the individual  since it has an incubation period from 2-14 days, so the testing will not always be accurate. 
In the end, the NFL simply did not do the best job of preventing the spread of the coronavirus due to how much freedom it gave teams to keep their players and staff safe. 
Finally, I wanted to end with the mixed bag of the NCAA, especially concerning football and basketball. Both of these collegiate sports seasons were hit with a multitude of cancellations and postponements with our own USC Trojans only playing a shortened six-game season. 
For both the football and the regular basketball seasons, they followed more of the NFL strategy to let teams deal with themselves — which I understand because there are so many teams in the NCAA, but when it came time to the NCAA tournament, they finally created their own bubble, which helped let March Madness run smoothly. 
The one place where I thought the NCAA, as well as the collegiate conferences and teams, did a good job was where they did not hesitate to cancel games like the VCU-Oregon game during the tournament in March.
Hopefully, the coronavirus pandemic will give these leagues a wake-up call on how they logistically manage their teams.

USC successfully began their postseason in San Diego at the Barnes Tennis Center by winning the Pac-12 Team Tournament over the weekend. 
The No. 13 USC Men’s Tennis team earned their fifth Pac-12 tournament title in program history, their first since 2019. Because of the pandemic and the subsequent cancellation of last year’s tournament, this weekend’s victory essentially meant back-to-back conference titles for the Trojans. 
USC was the third seed in the tournament and kicked things off by playing against the sixth-seed Oregon Ducks. The Trojans previously played the Ducks on April 3 when they easily won 5-2. Similar to this previous matchup, USC was able to beat Oregon once again in the quarterfinals with a 4-1 victory. 
In doubles play, the No. 14 duo of senior Daniel Cuckierman and redshirt senior Riley Smith beat the No. 42 Ducks partnership of junior Joshua Charlton and freshman Quinn Vandecasteele in a close 6-4 win. 
Afterwards, the No. 82 doubles team of sophomore Stefan Dostanic and junior Bradley Frye clinched the doubles point in a 6-3 win against Oregon’s senior Emmanuel Coste and sophomore Klöv-Nilsson.
Heading into singles, all Trojans were able to secure wins except for Frye, who lost to Klöv-Nilsson in straight sets, 3-6, 2-6. 
USC then had the chance to avenge their early-season loss against No. 24 Arizona. The Wildcats were a two-seed in the tournament and had beaten Utah in the quarterfinals.
Once again, the duos of Cuckierman and Smith and Dostanic and Fry were able to win their doubles matches to get the Trojans their doubles point. Then, in singles, Cukierman was able to easily upset No. 26 freshman Gustaf Strom, 6-1, 6-2. 
However, the singles matches started to get tense for the Trojans against Arizona senior Carlos Hassey beating junior Jake Sands, 1-6, 6-7. With this loss, the score became 2-1 in singles play. 
Nevertheless, Dostanic and Frye were able to win their respective singles matches in three sets to get the team the 4-1 win.  
The Trojans went on to face the other Arizona school, the fifth-seeded Arizona State Sun Devils, who previously upset both No. 4 UCLA and top-ranked Stanford. 
Back in late March, USC was able to easily beat the Sun Devils down in Tempe with a 6-1 win. 
This time around, Arizona State was looking to pull off their third upset of the tournament. After the match got delayed from 3 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. because of rain, the final match started with doubles. Despite their efforts, the Trojans ultimately lost the doubles point, 1-2, giving the Sun Devils a 1-0 lead going into singles. 
During singles play, the Trojans persevered as Frye, Sands and freshman Lodewijk Weststrate all won their matches in straight sets, giving USC a 3-1 advantage.
While Cukeriman and Smith played close matches against seniors Nathan Ponwith and Makey Rakotomalala, respectively, on court 3, Dostanic had the opportunity to seal up a victory against senior Tim Ruehl. After swiftly winning the first set 6-3, Dostanic tightly won in the second set 7-5, giving the Trojans the victory and their fifth Pac-12 title. 
As the Trojans celebrated their Pac-12 title defense, head coach Brett Masi was ecstatic about the win and the team’s singles comeback. 
“We knew that we were going to get [Arizona State’s] best go at us, and they came out and they were swinging away in doubles. I think when we settled in, I think our level was better than theirs but also just our conditioning,” Masi said. “Our three through six [positions Dostanic, Frye, Sands, and Westrate] did it for us and we didn’t rely on our two senior captains [Cuckierman and Smith].”
After getting the automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, the Trojans will wait until May 3 to hear their tournament-seeding and will head to the UTSA National Campus in Orlando, Fla. for the tournament, which will take place from May 16-28.

When Shamillah Iga’s brother began to grow out his natural hair, she noticed there were limited hair care products marketed towards Black men. Inspired by this, she founded Nile Hair, a company dedicated to reimagining natural haircare for men. 
“The main issue here is, like my brother, many Black men at the time really had to choose between products marketed for women or products not suited for their curls,” said Iga, a junior majoring in international relations global business. “That really began my journey with Nile Hair.”
Nile Hair began in Fall 2019 in one of Iga’s first entrepreneurship classes as a project on the initial stages of planning a business; she was encouraged to move beyond the course with something she was passionate about. When the pandemic hit, Iga said it felt as though it gave her more time to pursue her passions. 
“It was kind of an awakening about just how much I would prefer to go into entrepreneurship rather than a more traditional field of work with the instability that I saw everyone experiencing,” Iga said.
In Fall 2020, Iga’s business progressed further through her participation in LavaLab, USC’s student-run product incubator.
Every semester, LavaLab gives a small cohort of students the opportunity to learn how to build a startup. Last semester took a different form than usual as LavaLab launched their first virtual program called the social entrepreneurship toolkit.
“Over the past year, we’ve had a focus on making entrepreneurship accessible and inclusive for all,” said Glory Kanes, a senior majoring in computer science and business administration. Kanes is also LavaLab’s president. “We launched LavaLab for impact, which was specifically to support USC’s Black community with entrepreneurship.”
One of the new programs launched within this was LavaConnect, where students who had entrepreneurial ideas that supported Black communities and communities of color were paired with LavaLab alumni to help build their products.
In the program, students are paired with an e-board member and given a team that includes a product manager, designer and developers. Madison Gong, a junior majoring in cognitive science and LavaLab’s director of industry relations, was paired with Iga as her mentor in the process of further developing Nile Hair.
“LavaConnect is a very mentorship-based [program], very much so how we can help the student entrepreneurs achieve what they want to achieve during the semester,” Gong said. “It was very focused on making sure that their products came out the way they wanted with whatever help they needed.”
LavaConnect helped Iga improve on the work she had already done in the months prior.
“[Iga] already had a vision, we just helped,” Gong said. “We worked a lot with some design tools to revamp the branding, helping her set up the website [and] helping her with social media, where to get started with that.”
Andrew Hulin, a senior in the Iovine and Young Academy, worked on Iga’s team as the product manager. As product manager, Hulin helped with different product and design aspects as Iga was forming her vision for Nile Hair.
“My job was to help identify roadblocks, help with product decisions, help make sure that the solution being provided by the product really matches the needs of the community,” Hulin said. “In any capacity that I was present on the team, it was 100% guided by Shamillah. Everyone else was there to support and help unlock any potential barriers.”
As with starting any new business, Iga said she faced challenges “every day, if not every week.” But especially with the pandemic affecting the manufacturing industry as a whole, Iga faced difficulty with production and supply chains.
“The outer packaging, like the carton or box that the hair and beauty oil was going to go in, is sourced in China, but there [were] a lot of delays,” Iga said. “I had to pivot really quickly and ask [the manufacturers] to source that in the U.S. domestically, but even then, there were still delays.”
Despite these difficulties and delays, Nile Hair officially launched April 14. Iga’s vision for men’s natural hair care is now a reality with the release of her product “Headwaters Collection Hair and Beard Oil”.
Nile Hair also won 2nd place and a $20,000 prize in the Marshall School of Business’s New Venture Seed Competition.
“When I saw [the product] in person, it looked so much better than any of the digital mockups, which is an awesome experience and feels really rare,” Hulin said. “It’s a crazy experience to get it out there.”
However, Nile Hair is more than just a product. Iga said she also wants her company to have a focus on education, which led to the creation of a virtual barbershop. The barbershop allows for men with textured hair to talk to barbers about different hair care issues and solutions.
The concept for the barbershop sparked after Iga began talking to potential customers, where she found that men “really don’t have anyone to ask haircare questions to.” 
“What I got from them was that it would be different and really valuable and something substantial to be able to have a community or have men that look like them with their hair type talking about these issues online,” Iga said. 
With both the product and virtual barbershop, Iga wants Nile Hair to give Black men representation in the hair care industry. 
“The future of beauty and grooming is focused,” Iga said. “You can’t just throw out a blanket solution and [pretend] it’s going to work for everyone because companies are too lazy or don’t see the value in different consumer category types.”
