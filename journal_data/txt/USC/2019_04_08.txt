After a truck collision injured Troy Camp participant Amy Lorenzo, 12, and killed her older sister Marlene, 14, last Thursday, an uncle of the sisters has started a fundraiser to raise money for the family.
Amy and Marlene Lorenzo were hit by a semi-trailer truck while walking to school near the intersection of Broadway Place and West 37th Street. Both sisters were transported to the hospital, where Marlene was pronounced dead and Amy was treated in critical condition.
“Troy Camp is trying to support the Lorenzo family and share the GoFundMe and get them as much financial support and emotional support as they can,” said Molly Bamberger, executive co-director of Troy Camp, a student-run philanthropy organization centered on providing long-term mentorship for students in the South Los Angeles community.
The fundraiser has raised over $20,000 of its $100,000 goal at the time of publication.
Amy and Marlene’s uncle started the fundraiser on GoFundMe to alleviate the cost of the funeral, as well as surgery expenses for Amy. Troy Camp counselors have shared the fundraiser on social media to spread awareness and increase funding for the Lorenzo family.
Amy joined Troy Camp three years ago when she was in third grade and has been an active member since.
In her freshman year, Bamberger, now a senior majoring in public policy, became a designated counselor for Amy and nine other third-grade girls. 
“In the third grade, [Amy] was really shy,” Bamberger said. “It took her a little bit to open up and once she did, she has always been thoughtful [and] supportive.”
Over the years, Bamberger served as a mentor for Amy, seeing her and her cohort as often as every month. As Bamberger spent time with the girls, whether it was making food or “going on adventures” together, she became a mentor for Amy.
“She’s definitely a leader in our group,” Bamberger said. “She makes the other girls a little more thoughtful when they’re just being goofy and all over the place.”
Two of Amy and Marlene’s other siblings, a sister in third grade and a brother in fifth grade, will be joining Troy Camp this summer, Bamberger said. 
“We haven’t heard any further updates whether [Amy] been moved out or if the condition worsened,” said Troy Camp co-director Marla Ross, a senior majoring in cognitive science. “We’re just trying to give their family space right now.”

The USC Health Sciences Campus childcare facility Bright Horizons closed March 20 amid building safety concerns. 
“Last Wednesday, the HSC child care building was determined to be unsafe due to some overstressed roof beams,” the statement released on the USC Employee Gateway said. “As the engineer could not provide the assurance of safety, the children were moved out of the building.” 
According to the statement, the building’s foundation underneath the infant care room has been shifting due to soil movement but has been deemed safe for use for the past two years by Capital Construction.  
“The beam issue was discovered at the end of 2018 but the foundation issue has been going on for a couple of years … I’ve been working on it for about two years,” Bright Horizons program administrator Nancy Martiz said. “That was a project that was ongoing, it was being monitored and we also had a solution in place.” 
The closure notice was sent to administrators midday on March 20. Parents were notified around 10:30 p.m. The following Monday, USC program administrators, including Martiz, hosted a meeting to inform families about the situation. Detailed notes were sent to family members who were unable to attend. 
Children attending Bright Horizons have been temporarily placed in another childcare facility named Alcazar. A small number of infants have also been placed in the Duker home. Some families have opted to leave the childcare center for other facilities, said Awilda Bregand, the executive director of benefits. 
“Our plan is, and what we have communicated to the parents at the Health Science Campus is, for those that are incurring any expense because they’ve had to hire alternate care, we will reimburse them up to the cost of what their tuition at the Health Science Playground is,” Bregand said. 
All teachers have also been relocated to Alcazar to ensure they can still teach their respective students and receive full hours and benefits. 
“We’ve also made arrangements with Bright Horizons, who is the provider, they have a separate service called ‘Backup Care’ where employees can either find backup care at one of their alternate centers or hire someone to come to their home,” Bregand said.  
A report by Capital Construction listing the needed repairs is expected to be released later this week. After the report is finished, repairs, design time, city permits and other construction tasks will be evaluated to ensure the safety of the building. The company has finished the design for the beams and began the process of reinforcement on April 4, Bregand said. 
While the parent meeting originally estimated the project would take approximately two to three weeks, the project has expanded to approximately two to three months, according to an update posted on March 27. The administration is also exploring possible solutions in the case that the childcare center is unable to reopen. 
“I am hopeful, that if we are not able to reopen our center for any reason, we are actively working on exploring other spaces on campus,” Martiz said. “Closing a childcare center is not an option for us.” 
As construction begins, both Martiz and Bregand said that making sure the children are cared for is their top priority. 
“The care of our little ones is most important,” Bregand said. “We don’t want anything to disrupt their care ever, but sometimes things happen. This was something that none of us expected … We’ve been really trying to do the best for all the families so they can get the care they need.”

Members of the Latino Business Student Association gathered at Tommy’s Place last night to celebrate the club’s first year back at USC following its official return in August.
The End of Year Reception brought together over 50 students, alumni, faculty and business professionals to reflect on the past year and recognize members with scholarships.
LBSA president Aaron Eckstein introduced LBSA vice president Ricardo Reyes, LBSA alumnus Luis Sandoval and clinical business communication professor Sharoni Little as the speakers of the night.
According to Eckstein, LBSA had been active since 1978, before falling inactive in fall 2017.  After he was accepted as a transfer student last April, Eckstein tried to reach out to LBSA to potentially rekindle the association after he received a message from a USC graduate and former LBSA member that the group was inactive.
Eckstein said he decided to bring back LBSA to USC to make a greater impact on student life at USC. He created a board of six members, who coordinated recruitment for over 150 active members. Nearly a year later, LBSA is now recognized as one of the largest student organizations at the Marshall School of Business. 
“I’m at USC for a reason,” Eckstein said. “I want to be an entrepreneur, I want to make a difference in the community, so why not relaunch it?” 
Reyes, a junior majoring in neuroscience, said that continuing to establish a culture of innovation is the key to the future of LBSA.The club aims to create mentorship opportunities and networking events as well as host professional development sessions for its members.
“I hope this journey continues to be an entrepreneurial journey for everyone,” Reyes said. “I don’t want it to become complacent in any way. I constantly want to challenge ourselves to be better.” 
Several LBSA alumni attended the reception to show their support of the relaunch, including Sandoval, who stressed the importance of active mentorship in his address.
“Mentorship is incredibly important as it relates to diversity and inclusion, but really that 2.0, that next level, that 2.0, is turning mentorship into sponsorship and advocacy,” Sandoval said. “And not only giving guidance on how to get to the table, but putting them into that seat.” 
Little, who also serves as the associate dean of the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work, said that establishing diversity and inclusivity on campus is the driving force of the future.
“It’s about what is the importance of diversity equity and inclusion today,” Little said. “Because whether it’s in the professional space, the personal space, or the academic space, you are not only absolutely needed and wanted, but you belong to be there because you will be driving the leadership.”

Two USC parents are among the 13 who agreed to plead guilty for their involvement in the college admissions bribery scheme, an attorney for one of the parents said in a statement Monday.
Bay Area real estate developer Bruce Isackson and Davina Isackson are accused of paying over $600,000 to help their two older daughters gain admission to UCLA and USC, according to FBI documents. 
In a joint statement released by attorney David Willingham, who represents Davina Isackson, the couple apologized for their involvement in the scandal and said they will cooperate with law enforcement.
“Our duty as parents was to set a good example for our children and instead we have harmed and embarrassed them by our misguided decisions,” the statement read. “We have also let down our family, friends, colleagues and our entire community. We have worked cooperatively with the prosecutors and will continue to do so as we take full responsibility for our bad judgment.”
Other parents indicted in the FBI investigation who will plead guilty include actress Felicity Huffman and marketing guru Jane Buckingham. Buckingham allegedly paid mastermind William “Rick” Singer to have a proctor take her son’s ACT with the hopes of getting her son admitted to USC. 
The parents will plead guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, and Bruce Isackson will additionally plead guilty to one count of money laundering conspiracy and a count of conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.
According to the FBI documents, the Isacksons paid over $15,000 to Singer to have a proctor change their younger daughter’s ACT scores in 2017. Singer also contacted former USC senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel for help admitting the Isackson’s younger daughter as a fake crew recruit. 
Former assistant soccer coach Laura Janke created a profile claiming the Isackson’s daughter had previous competitive crew experience, and Heinel informed the family in December 2017 that their daughter would be admitted as a student-athlete, according to FBI documents. After their daughter was officially admitted to USC in Spring 2018, the Isacksons paid $250,000 to the Key Worldwide Foundation, part of which was also paid to Heinel, according to the documents. 
Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic were terminated from their positions in March when the investigation revealed their alleged involvement in the scheme. Janke left USC in 2014.
USC previously announced in a statement that it is conducting a case-by-case review of any students who could be associated with the admissions scandal. The accounts of the students connected to the bribery scheme have been placed on hold, preventing them from withdrawing from the University or requesting transcripts. They cannot register for classes until they agree to participate in their case review. 
“Among many factors investigators could consider in reviewing each case are any developments in the criminal cases, including plea deals by parents,” USC wrote in an updated statement Monday. 
Singer collected payments from 33 wealthy parents through his Key Worldwide Foundation, a nonprofit that allegedly worked to conceal bribes made to college coaches and an athletic official as donations. The bribery scam helped the children of celebrities, executives and professors gain admission to universities like USC, UCLA, Yale University and Stanford University.
