With the exception of law students, not many Trojans venture inside the USC Gould School of Law Library, but those who have might know about a unique presidential treasure that harks back to the days of Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War.
Presidential · The Lincoln Library, located inside the Law School Library, includes a faux fireplace and an original lithograph of President Abraham Lincoln. - Phoebe Pan | Daily Trojan
This treasure is the Lincoln Reading Room, featuring a rare collection of letters, books and other Lincoln memorabilia dating back to the 1860s that open a window into the mind of one of the nation’s most revered presidents.
The Lincoln Room officially opened February 12, 2009, in honor of Lincoln’s 200th birthday. The International Trial Lawyers Association donated the private collection after James Ackerman, a member of ITLA and USC Law alumnus of 1948, suggested it go to his alma mater.
Students studying inside Lincoln’s living room can sit in replicas of Lincoln’s Victorian armchairs and gaze at lithographs of Lincoln’s family portraits above a faux fireplace while reading Lincoln biographies and books by Lincoln.
Rebecca Neighbors, a second-year law student said, although none of her classes have discussed Lincoln, the nation’s 16th president has taught her powerful judicial lessons.
“Lincoln had to make a lot of tough decisions in his time,” Neighbors said. “But he was not narrow-minded. Lincoln understood that law is not just about doing what’s right for you or your client. It’s about the bigger picture and Lincoln knew what was best for the future of this country.”
The Lincoln Room houses historical classics recapping Lincoln’s career as a lawyer, famous debates with rival Stephen Douglas and copies of Lincoln’s famous presidential speeches, including the Emancipation Proclamation.
Leonette Williams, associate director of the Law Library, said that although law students rarely have time to explore the contents of the Lincoln Reading Room, she hopes the collection leaves a lasting impression on students.
“Students have enough to cover in law school and often don’t have to study anything but the law,” Williams said. “But we’d like to think it inspires them.”
The Lincoln collection is the Law Library’s largest presidential collection, Williams said.
Brian Raphael, assistant director of the Law Library, said the reading room and collection are open to all USC students.
“The room is an informal place for all USC students to come and study,” Raphael said. “You can also request any book and take a look.”
Raphael said not many students actually look inside the books, but those who are interested will be provided with white gloves and access to an exclusive viewing room.
Eric Khodadian, a third-year law student and editor-in-chief of the Southern California Review of Law and Social Justice, said the Lincoln collection showcases the library’s rich historical perspective.
“Lincoln was a model leader in spurring social change,” Khodadian said. “The Lincoln Room helps students appreciate Lincoln, who was a well-known attorney that traveled the circuit in a time when large law firms didn’t exist.”
DR. ABRAHAM LINCOLN IS THE GREATEST AMERICAN WHO EVER LIVED! END  OF DISCUSSION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Did not know that there is  a “Lincoln Room” w/i the Law Library. I spent an Afternoon in the Library b/f the USC-Washington Game during Parents Weekend 2010. My daughter was studying in her Dorm right up until Kickoff.
Yeah Right! AAR I will be sure to visit the LR next time I am at SC. BTW the Patent Collection in the Law Library Stacks are pretty Abysmal. Hint. Hint.

Most USC students were unaware of ordinances reversed by the Los Angeles Dept. of Beaches and Harbors at a Feb. 9 meeting of the Board of Supervisors, such as a ban on throwing footballs and Frisbees.
The new ordinances allow more recreational activities at beaches in L.A. County, contrary to original news reports, said Carol Baker, chief of community and marketing services for the Dept. of Beaches and Harbors.
Brett Hughes, a freshman majoring in accounting, said the original ordinance was not needed.
“It’s good [they lifted the ban],” Hughes said. “It was unnecessary for them to have had one in the first place.”
Baker said during the summer months, areas will be established where beachgoers can throw Frisbees and footballs.
“It had been a year-round ban, so now during the months when it’s not completely crowded at the beaches, we allow for those activities to take place,” Baker said.
The ordinance, which applies to 16 beaches throughout L.A. County running from the Malibu area to Point Fermin, will enhance the beach experience while still enabling lifeguards to do their job, Baker said.
“The lifeguards do need the ability on a regular day to say, ‘Hey, you know what guys, there’s too many little kids around here,’ or ‘You’re going to trample a sunbather, go up the beach 50 yards or go closer to [the] boardwalk and not so close to the shore where you’ve got little kids digging in the sand,’” Baker said.
The previous ban had been in place since 1970, but very few people knew about it. Baker said there are similarities in that the institutionalized ordinance will not have a major impact on beachgoers.
“It also creates opportunities for things that seem to be expressively prohibited by the [previous] ordinance because before the only kind of ball you could have was an inflatable beach ball,” Baker said. “So we wanted to change that.”
The beaches will not impose $1,000 citations for misconduct, but a first time offense will receive a $100 fine and each subsequent offense will have a greater fee, capped at $500.
Upon learning the actual ruling of the ordinance, students were glad to see the ban lifted, even if it was never a major concern anyway.
Rex Christensen, an undeclared freshman, said the lifting of the original ordinance was the correct decision because recreational activities, such as football and Frisbee, are a part of beach culture.
“One of the biggest reasons people go to the beach is for recreational purposes,” Christensen said. “Being out in the sun, swimming, playing volleyball — the beach is kind of a little getaway. I don’t feel as if there should be restrictions.”
[clarification]  This is a good example of why All meetings should be conducted while participants are Standing Up, not sitting down.  They would have less time or inclination to make stupid rules.  Should Never be a fine for throwing a Frisbee on the beach … Please !
This is a good example of why All meetings should be conducted while participants are Standing Up.  They would give themselves less time to make stupid rules.  Any fine for thowing a Frisbee … Please !
Captain Obvious again working hard at DT.     USC students favor free beer too!

Writers for The Onion, a popular satirical news organization, spoke on Thursday at Dice It up with the Writers of The Onion, an event hosted by USC Spectrum at Bovard Auditorium.
Laugh · At the beginning of the show, Onion head writer Seth Reiss and features editor Joe Garden demonstrate what the audience should do if one of them collapses onstage at a program Thursday sponsored by USC Spectrum. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
The Onion, which was first published in 1988 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, features online and printed articles, radio broadcasts and video news segments that cover fictional and non-fictional local, national and international events.
The event, featured Onion’s head writer, Seth Reiss, and its features editor, Joe Garden, and highlighted many of the newspaper’s humorous stories throughout its publication, including “Congress Takes Group Of Schoolchildren Hostage” and “Michael Phelps Returns To His Tank At Sea World.”
Reiss and Garden also mocked headlines from newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times.
Reiss said one of the main reasons The Onion has continued to stay popular while other newspapers are facing financial hardship is because the organization’s use of the Internet and social networking.
“The Onion went online in 1996, and a large amount, around 90 percent, of our readers come from the Internet,” Reiss said. “The fact that we have a fully functioning website and a fully functioning social media network really helps [us achieve] our success.”
Reiss  also said one of the ways the print version of The Onion has thrived is through its franchising deals with nearly 20 cities.
“For our print paper, we’ve been doing these franchising deals, where these cities will bring us to their city, and we provide all the content, while they do all the advertising and circulation,” Reiss said.
Garden and Reiss are keeping another projects, a compilation of past and current content from The Onion, under wraps.
“We’re currently working on a book that’s going to be released in October that we’ll be working on for the next few months,” Garden said. “We can’t really talk about it right now, but it’s going to be pretty insane.”
As for the future of The Onion, Garden said Readers should have big expectations for future publications.
“We’re probably going to the stars, or at least another dimension,” Garden said. “We’re actually very focused on our book right now, but after that’s blown over, you can expect us to be more embracing of social media, focusing more on Twitter and doing more video segments online as well.”
Many of the students at the event were entertained by the content The Onion has published during its history, including Taylor Barnhill, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering.
“All the stuff The Onion posts is so outrageous and hilarious, it’s hard to believe that people actually get offended by it,” Barnhill said.

Worries about grades on term papers, lab reports and final exams can make up a large portion of undergraduate stress, but according to a panel held by the Center for Excellence in Teaching on Thursday, grading also is one of the biggest concerns for Teaching Assistants and professors.
The event, Grading Strategies for T.A.’s and Instructors, consisted of a panel of three CET teaching assistant fellows and one faculty fellow who addressed issues such as fairly and accurately grading student work.
Grade inflation frequently surfaced in the conversation between panelists and the audience.
Teaching assistant fellow Juvenal Cortes said some of the worry about grade inflation comes from conflicts between professors’ expectations of an average grade and the T.A.s’ knowledge of the actual competency of students.
“T.A.’s don’t have much power over the average grades because it depends on what professors want their class average to be,” Cortes said. “As T.A.’s, we are constrained by what the professor wants. And there’s no straight-across rubric over the college for grading.”
Disparities in the perception of letter grade meanings can also account for some problems, teaching assistant fellow Chris Corzett said.
“Different people view an A as being something different,” Corzett said, “Whether it’s one or two people per class getting an A, a certain percentage of people getting an A or if everyone does exemplary work, they all get A’s.”
The university defines each letter grade in its Grading and Correction of Grades Handbook, with “excellent” work earning A’s, “good” work earning B’s and “fair” work earning C’s.
These definitions, however, are by no means absolute, and the subtle differences between a right and wrong answer in some disciplines can also make accurate grading a challenge, Cortes said.
“For the social sciences, grading is more difficult than the hard sciences, because something is not just wrong or right,” Cortes said. “It’s more complex than that.”
Though many T.A.’s expressed concerns over causing grade inflation in their courses, faculty fellow Steven Finkel said he does not see a major problem at USC.
“I have been in institutions with grade inflation and I don’t think USC suffers from it,” Finkel said. “I think A’s mean something here.”
The panel also discussed strategies to help T.A.’s grade fairly. Teaching assistant fellow Edson Rodriguez mentioned grading parties, where T.A.’s and professors grade papers or tests side-by-side, as one way to correct differences in grading.
“It is crucial for everyone to be on the same page,” Rodriguez said. “Grading is a relationship as well. It’s a relationship between students, T.A.’s, the professor and the department.”
Other strategies T.A.’s and instructors can use to ensure fair grading include distributing rubrics to students before assigning work, including feedback as part of the teaching process and taking the time to speak individually to students about their work.
Whichever way T.A.’s choose to implement their grading policy, CET fellows said they hope this event motivates them to strive for higher standards in their teaching.
“The goal of the program is to improve teaching at USC and as a consequence improve learning at USC,” Cortes said. “The center is called the Center for Excellence in Teaching, but it should be called the Center for Excellence in Learning.”

Last year, USC men’s tennis entered the ITA National Team Indoor Championships undefeated and left with its only losses of the spring season.
On Friday, No. 1 USC will again enter the four-day competition in Charlottesville, Va. with a 7-0 record, but the Trojans hope to come out victorious with their first ITA Team Indoors title since 1988.
No. 1 ranked singles player Steve Johnson will lead the charge against first round opponent No. 20 Tennessee (4-3). The reigning NCAA singles champion, who holds a 44-match win streak in collegiate singles, will be accompanied by fellow senior Daniel Nguyen, who is ranked No. 16 in ITA rankings.
Winner · Sophomore Emilio Gomez finished 24-5 in 2011. He and the Trojans are looking to win their fourth consecutive national title. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
The underclassmen corps includes sophomores No. 12 Ray Sarmiento and No. 48 Emilio Gomez, as well as freshmen No. 33 Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz.
While Hanfmann and Sarmiento both hold a 5-1 singles record this season, Gomez and Quiroz have yet to lose on their respective courts.
Other Trojans that could see the court this weekend are freshmen Eric Johnson and Jordi Vives.
In doubles action, the duo of Johnson and Hanfmann carry a four-game winning streak into the tournament. One of those wins was over California’s Nick Andrews and Christoffer Konigsfeldt, the No. 5 pair in the nation.
Nguyen and Sarmiento are 5-1 together in doubles, while Gomez and Quiroz recently dropped a five-game winning streak with a 2-8 loss to Pepperdine’s Hugh Clarke and David Sofaer.
Tennessee will face USC after two consecutive losses to No. 10 Duke and No. 18 Illinois.
USC, on the other hand, carries a 26-match winning streak into the tournament spanning from last season’s run to their third consecutive NCAA championship.
“Our momentum is important because we need it to get rolling in the Indoors,” Hanfmann said. “I think we have a good enough team to get far in this year’s tournament.”
Last year’s competition took place in Seattle, where Duke upset No. 2-seeded USC in the first round, 4-3. The Trojans then fell to Stanford 3-4 in consolation play, giving USC its only two losses of the 2011 season.
Since 2008, USC has not been able to advance past the quarterfinals, losing to the likes of Ohio State, Georgia and Texas.
“In the last few years, we’ve had issues or injuries going into the Indoors. I’m glad that this year, there’s nothing bothering us off the court so we can focus on the court,” Johnson said.
USC last played in the championship match in 1991 and has not hoisted the trophy since its 1987 and 1988 titles under coach Dick Leach.
If the Trojans advance to the finals, they will need to endure four matches in the span of four days.
“For the guys that have been there before, we know what it takes to play four tough matches in four days,” Johnson said. “It’s just a little different, but we’ll be ready, and we’re all in good shape.”
USC will kick off tournament play at 12:30 p.m. on Friday. Should they advance, they will face the winner of No. 8 UCLA vs. No. 10 Duke in the quarterfinals.

Men’s swimming ends regular season Saturday vs. Utah.
Turning it around · Sophomore Vladimir Morozov is hoping to get the Trojans back to their winning ways. The team has lost two straight meets. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information
After a pair of tough losses to No. 6 California and No. 3 Stanford, USC’s No. 5-ranked men’s swimming and diving team (3-3, 1-3) will end its dual meet season at home against Pac-12 rival Utah (5-5, 1-2) Saturday at noon.
The Trojan squad is led by a plethora of All-Americans, including sophomores Vladimir Morozov and Dimitri Colupaev, junior Alex Lendrum and senior Jeff Daniels. Morozov currently holds the nation’s top times in the 50- and 100-yard backstroke, with Colupaev leading the nation in the 200-yard freestyle. Lendrum is ranked second in the 200-yard backstroke, and freshman Chad Bobrosky ranks ninth in the 200-yard freestyle.
The Utes are coming off a tough loss to rival BYU. Junior Ryan Hansen won the 500-yard and 1,000-yard freestyle, and senior Major Robinson and junior Austin Fiascone finished first and second in the 200-yard backstroke, respectively. They were originally scheduled to host the meet in Salt Lake City but moved it to USC in order to check out the facility where the Pac-12 championships will be held.
The meet is also the final home event for seniors Daniels, Julian Bonse, Will Orlady and co-captain Jack Ostler. After this, the teams will prepare for the Pac-12 championships in Long Beach from Feb. 29-Mar. 3, followed by the NCAA championships qualifiers, which begin March 8.

Crimes against a person
At 2:11 p.m. on Feb. 15, an unidentified bicyclist collided with a staff member’s vehicle while he was driving near Exposition Boulevard and Watt Way, breaking off the passenger-side-view mirror. The bicyclist rode away without stopping to exchange information.
at 10:35 p.m. on Feb. 14, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a non-USC male grab hold of a non-USC female’s arm and forcibly prevent her from walking away during an argument near Hoffman Contracts Research Building. The officers detained the subjects for questioning and determined that they were husband and wife. The female assured the officers that she was in no danger from her husband, and they were subsequently released.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 3:13 p.m. on Feb. 14, DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC male causing a disturbance at the Healthcare Consultation Center. A doctor, who was treating the subject’s wife, requested that he leave the premises and he complied without further incident before the officers arrived.
At 2:56 p.m. on Feb. 14, DPS officers responded to a student complaining of difficulty breathing and chest pains at the Pertusati University Bookstore. An LAFD R.A. unit was requested and Unit #10 responded. The R.A. unit examined the student and offered transportation for medical treatment, but she declined and was released at the scene.
at 2:34 p.m. on Feb. 14, DPS officers responded to a report of three people trapped in an elevator at the Estelle Doheny Eye Foundation and requested LAFD for assistance. LAFD unit #2 responded and freed the subjects without incident.

Though the USC men’s volleyball team defeated Hope International in an out-of-conference game in straight sets — 25-20, 25-22, 25-21 — the victory was hard fought.
Clean sweep· Freshman outside hitter Cristian Rivera finished with five kills on Thursday. The Trojans will face Hawai’i at home March 2. - Garry Chien | Daily Trojan
Junior opposite hitter Maddison McKibbin — 11 kills, six digs and three blocks — and redshirt sophomore setter Chris Trefzger — two kills, 25 assists, four digs and seven blocks — led the Trojans with very strong statistical outings as the Royals hung around in each set.
“[Coming into the game], we [wanted] to get Maddison [McKibbin] back in the flow of playing a game and Trefzger some experience setting,” coach Bill Ferguson said. “When talking to a setter, it’s not just going out and playing, it’s also knowing that we’re going to give him information on a timeout how to run the offense, and he responded pretty well to stuff like that.”
Redshirt junior outside hitter Steven Mochalski contributed in a very good all-around performance, recording 10 kills, three assists, six digs and three blocks. But his true contributions on the court were invisible off the stat sheet.
“Mochalski is one of those guys that quietly does everything well,” Ferguson said. “He’s the kind of guy that gets kills when teams think they got us where they want us; Mochalski comes out with a big swing.”
The Trojans struggled to pull away in the first set until a long rally resulted in pushing the Trojans into the lead, 12 to 11. After that, the Trojans surged ahead of the Royals, leading 24-17, but needed to withstand a late mini-run before winning the first set 25-20.
The second set was much tighter throughout, as the lead never exceeded more than three points. The Trojans fell behind late in the set, 17-18. But, USC managed to come back and steal the set late, 25-22.
The third set started tumultuously for the Trojans, falling behind 4-7. But after a string of kills by McKibbin, USC took the lead 10-9 and assumed a dominant 22-15 lead. The Royals rallied late once again to push the game within four points, but the Trojans retained the lead through the set to seal the team’s seventh win of the season with a 25-21 third set.
Ferguson mentioned before the match he wanted to incorporate the young players on the team, and Cristian Rivera was one that stood out.
“[Rivera’s] a guy who had to sit out most of the fall because he was practicing twice a day” Ferguson said of his freshman outside hitter who plays for the Puerto Rican J National team. “Where most guys were getting a lot of training in the fall, Cristian was catching up. He’s a guy we expect big things from in our program in the future.”
After Thursday’s match, the Trojans will hit the road and play the University of Pacific in Stockton, Calif., on Feb. 24 followed by a game at Stanford the following day when they will resume play in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation.
Ferguson believed that the team must develop its mental toughness traveling to Pacific, to contest the active crowd. “The crowd at Pacific isn’t very big, but it knows its volleyball and can be a big factor,” he explained.
The Trojans’ next game at the Galen Center will be on March 2 against Hawai’i.

The USC women’s golf team, three months separated from its last tournament play, started the spring season on a high note, riding a strong finish from sophomore Sophia Popov to finish second at the 2012 Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge Wednesday.
The tournament, held at the Palos Verdes Golf Course in Chula Vista, Calif., featured another triumph by rival UCLA, which captured its fourth victory this season with a final score of 18-over-par 870.
The Women of Troy, the two-time defending champions of the event, finished at 30-over-par 882. Pepperdine finished third at 35-over-par 887, and Arizona State rounded out the top four at 39-over-par 891.
The solid performance was especially critical for Popov, the 2011 Freshman of the Year whose wrist injury allowed her to complete only one tournament in the fall. Popov finished second at 1-over-par 214, including an impressive final round, in which she hit seven birdies and a 4-under-par 67.
Freshman Doris Chen notched her best ranking this season, finishing 10th at 8-over-par 221 to overcome a particularly rough final round. Senior Inah Park recorded her third top-20 finish, coming in tied for 16th at 9-over-par 222. All-American senior Lisa McCloskey finished tied for 23rd at 12-over-par 225 after remaining in top-10 contention the first two days. Sophomore Rachel Morris finished tied for 46th at 18-over-par 231.
The first two days marked a strong group effort for the Women of Troy, who entered the final day of play at second place. Chen turned in the best performance of 1-over-par 72 in the first round before notching three birdies to finish even 71 in the second round.
McCloskey rebounded from a 5-over-par 76 in the first round to shoot a 1-over-par 72 Tuesday, while Popov followed up a 2-over-par 73 first round with 1-over on each set of nine holes to finish the second round at 2-over-par 73. Park played to a 4-over-par 75 through both rounds, while Morris recorded scores of 5-over-par 76 during the first two days of play.
Wet, gloomy conditions on the final day created considerable struggle, but the Women of Troy maintained their second-place standing, finishing the day at 294. Chen and Morris struggled to rounds of 7-over-par 78 and 8-over-par 79, respectively, while McCloskey ended at 6-over-par 77. Park saw a three-stroke increase from her previous rounds, making two birdies and three bogeys to finish 1-over-par 72. The rain didn’t deter Popov.  She finished 12 strokes behind Duke’s Lindy Duncan, who won the tournament with a final score of 3-under-par 210.
“It was definitely a great start to the season,” Popov said. “I’m happy I could go out there with some confident ball striking and see it pay off.” The Trojans will have two weeks before participating in the All-State Sugar Bowl, held at the English Turn Country Club in New Orleans Feb. 26-28, followed by the SDSU/Battle at Rancho Bernardo March 18-20.

The phrase “junior day” isn’t likely to ring a bell in most people’s minds, regardless of their allegiance to the game of college football.
That’s because, to the uninformed eye, the event seems to be little beyond a bunch of eager high schoolers checking out a university campus.
But it’s much more than that.
On Feb. 11, more than 100 of the best high school football players in the nation flocked to Southern California to visit USC’s campus and to catch a glimpse of what life’s like as a Trojan. And behind the tours, the speeches and the posturing given by USC coaches and staff, there lies an integral step in the recruiting process -— one that could pay major dividends a couple years down the road.
The first impression.
Each year, USC is charged with the task of showcasing itself to these undecided high school juniors (hence, “junior day”) in an effort to sway their young minds. It’s not an easy process of course — with so many options and so many outside influences, not every tantalizing tour or statistic is going to stick.
Combine that fact with the situation the team currently sits in because of NCAA sanctions and it’s clear that junior day 2012 was shaping up to be a markedly more difficult sell than most years.
You would think then that Trojan coaches would stick to their guns when showing off their places of work — the mountain of trophies, the mile-long list of USC grads in the NFL, the history that few schools come close to rivaling. But this year, that wasn’t the case.
Athletic Director Pat Haden and coach Lane Kiffin decided to go a different direction in wooing their guests, instead focusing on USC’s recent hike in the academic rankings as a means of getting attention. The pair — and others — made it clear that in addition to entertaining potential dominance in the football sphere, those who commit to USC are putting a strong foot forward in the world of academia.
The team of recruiters also made one-on-one time a priority, meeting with as many guests face-to-face as time allowed. The message was clear and simple: By enrolling at USC, your experience will be a complete and personal one, extending far beyond the football field.
A bold move in front of a 17-year-old crowd, to say the least, but it appears that the refreshing take struck a chord with many potential recruits. The mood around junior day was one of pleasant surprise, as several highly touted invitees admitted to having their eyes opened throughout the course of the day.
This reaction, of course, couldn’t come at a better time. With three years of limitations threatening to weigh down the football team, laying a solid foundation down in the reputation department is the only way USC will be able to distinguish itself from the myriad other colleges boasting 10-win seasons and a platter full of tradition.
And though the Trojans haven’t received any solid verbal commitments yet from the recruits given offers on junior day, expectations for the class of 2013 are soaring higher than ever.
Quarterback Max Browne, considered the best at his position in the 2013 class, flew down from Sammamish, Wash., for the day and mentioned that he will return in the spring to consider USC further. Su’a Cravens, a five-star safety from Murrieta, Calif., is now expected to have the Trojans at the top of his list while he mulls over his big decision.
There is almost another full year before USC will truly find out which leads produced and which were for naught. But regardless of what is to come, the junior day reaction is beyond promising. At a time when a simple visit can influence an entire decision, it looks like the Trojans put their best foot forward.

Something about the crack of a well-struck ball off a wooden bat, the smack of a ball landing perfectly in the pocket of a glove, the smell of pine tar or freshly mown grass makes baseball uniquely cherished in the hearts of its fans
It does not have the intensity of football, the tempo of basketball, the fluidity of hockey or the raw emotion of soccer. But it has an innate simplicity, a purity and timelessness that fans treasure deeply.
Taking the mound · Senior pitcher Brandon Garcia is one of several experienced players that coach Frank Cruz will depend on during the season. Garcia batted .309 in 2011 and started five games at pitcher. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Baseball returns to USC’s Dedeaux Field on Friday as the Trojans host Jacksonville University on opening night for both teams, and just the thought of that makes USC coach Frank Cruz’s eyes light up.
“[Opening day] reminds you of the pastime. It is the pastime,” Cruz said. “All the players are announced, they’re all out there for the anthem. And everybody’s excited. It’s a new start. It’s a fresh start. And it’s just a real special feeling.”
It will be a special feeling for the Trojans’ starting pitcher. Redshirt senior Andrew Triggs spurned a professional contract for the second year in a row and is back for his third consecutive year as the Trojans’ Friday night ace.
“I’m really excited to be back,” Triggs said. “I hope it’s a real special season.”
Triggs led the team in innings pitched last season with 90 2/3, amassing a 5-4 record and a 3.67 ERA. Most impressive, however, were his 72 strikeouts to just 28 walks on the season.
“We’re ecstatic to have Andrew back,” Cruz says. “Any time you can return a Friday night starter, that’s huge.”
Triggs is not the only returning player whom Cruz feels lucky to have back. Both senior catcher Kevin Roundtree and senior outfielder Alex Sherrod had a significant possibility of being drafted. But neither of them were, and now they’re back for their final season with the Trojans.
In Roundtree, USC returns a three-year starter and steady presence behind the plate who hit leadoff and finished with a .308 batting average and .404 slugging percentage last season.
Cruz said Roundtree has moved himself from a leadoff hitter to the middle-of-the-order hitter.
Easily the most pure and experienced hitter of these 2012 Trojans, Sherrod slugged .486 last season to lead the team, beating out All-American and third-round draft pick first baseman Ricky Oropesa.
As for USC’s opponent this weekend, this team is tougher than the Dolphin mascot might suggest. Jacksonville returns 20 players from a team that competed in the NCAA Regionals last season. Their first baseman, Adam Walker II, is one of the top prospects in next year’s draft.
“They’re supposedly called a ‘mid-major,’” said Cruz. “But they’re gonna be good. I don’t care what anybody says, this is a legitimate team.”
Though the Trojans lack a star draft prospect, they will try to make up for that in experience. Six of the positional starters will be upperclassmen, including five seniors.
And one of the underclassmen, sophomore shortstop James Roberts, is plenty experienced, having started every game at that position last year as a true freshman.
USC plans on starting two true freshmen this year: Dante Flores at second base and Stephen Tarpley, who was drafted in the eighth round last year but chose instead to come to USC, as a  left-handed starting pitcher.
Saturday’s game is scheduled for 2 p.m. with senior righty Ben Mount on the hill for the Trojans. Tarpley will take the mound for the series finale Sunday at 1 p.m.

The 2012 Grammys have come and gone, but an interest in the honorees’ artistic inspiration remains. For many of the hottest artists, their personal lives make for songwriting gold — and sometimes the messier their lives are, the more brilliant an artist’s work becomes.
Adele took home a whopping six Grammys, including record of the year and album of the year, all of which were the result of her critically acclaimed album, 21. Her excitement was evident as she got onstage to accept each of her awards; ironically, her complete and utter ecstasy is the antithesis of her album’s subject matter.
There is no need to sugarcoat it: Adele’s music is downright depressing. She is haunted by terrible breakups and longs for what she cannot have. So, though millions of listeners sing along in a carefree manner, her music features some dirty laundry she clearly needed to get off her chest.
Fans need not look any further than her breakaway hits “Rolling in the Deep” and “Someone Like You” — both of which made the Billboard Hot 100. A recurring line in her acclaimed, lovelorn ballad “Someone Like You” goes: “I’d hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded / That for me, it isn’t over.”
That line is what every bitter Facebook post on Valentine’s Day was trying to say.
Breakups are awful, but Adele utilized that negative energy and spent an entire album lamenting it. Her lyrics are so melancholic that many are surprised to learn that she has a charming, humorous personality.
As indicated by her success, she is not one to sit around and sob. She harnesses her resentment to criticize past lovers, as in “Rolling in the Deep,” which is about an unfaithful man in her life. In an interview with Q magazine, she said, “People will hear it and go, ‘Wow, she ain’t mucking around.’”
Adele could have wallowed in self-pity, but instead she took her painful experiences and used them as fuel for her creative process. And, after a sweep at the Grammys, the results of doing so speak for themselves.
But Adele wasn’t the only one at the awards show that channeled inner problems: Perhaps the most personal moment of the entire telecast belonged to Katy Perry. The usually energetic, fun-loving pop star traded in her hits from her successful sophomore album, Teenage Dream, in favor of a catchy but poignant new song, “Part of Me.”
Now, before any more speculation, it is worth noting that “Part of Me” is an old song. It was a song Perry recorded in the Teenage Dream sessions and ended up not making the cut for the album, which was released in fall 2010. Because she is prepping for the re-release of the record in March, she and her producers reworked her new single. This song and two other unreleased tracks will appear on Teenage Dream: The Complete Confection in addition to six remixes.
But that is not the juicy part. The hot gossip surrounds Perry’s recent divorce from British actor/comedian Russell Brand. Many on Twitter seem to think that this song is Katy’s response to their split — a sort of middle finger at Brand.
But the song is most likely about her previous boyfriend, rapper and frontman of Gym Class Heroes, Travie McCoy; it can be inferred that he is also the subject of Perry’s angsty song “Circle the Drain” from Teenage Dream.
It also turns out that “Part of Me” leaked back in 2010, and, aside from production changes, it had two different lines of lyrics in the bridge.
The original lyrics were “You can keep the dog / I never liked him anyway.” But Perry changed them for the song’s debut at the Grammys to say “You can keep the diamond ring / It don’t mean nothing anyway.”
And boy, did Perry’s performance pack a punch. Absent were her usual kitty cats and cotton candy. Instead, she looked like a blue-haired warrior, a sight that was further accentuated by explosive pyrotechnics. The performance was somber and ferocious, and Perry, like Adele, used her personal troubles to enhance her artistic creativity to tremendous results.
Venting is healthy and therapeutic, which is why so many artists choose to bemoan their troubles in their songs. It allows them to make peace with difficult situations, to get through them and to reach the pinnacle of creative achievement.

It would be hard to name a film studio that’s earned more respect than Studio Ghibli, the Japanese production company that, as a purveyor of brilliant works of animation, has an even more reliable track record than Pixar.
This sterling reputation is due in no small part to co-founder Hayao Miyazaki, who might be the only person who could conceivably challenge Walt Disney for the title of “greatest animator in history.”
Here kitty, kitty · Hiromasa Yonebayashi’s animated wonder The Secret World of Arrietty contains stunning visuals and a talented cast of voiceover actors. Arrietty is a four-inch-tall girl who lives within the confines of an average family home and must face obstacles everyday ­— like a massive cat. - Photo courtesy of Walt Disney Motion Pictures
Studio Ghibli’s newest release, The Secret World of Arrietty, isn’t one of Miyazaki’s own films, but his script, combined with the efforts of first-time director Hiromasa Yonebayashi — the youngest in the studio’s history to helm a film — contains the high level of polish and simple sense of wonder that Ghibli is famous for.
More so than some other examples of anime, Arriety might be familiar to American audiences as the film is a reasonably faithful take on the classic children’s book series The Borrowers, by Mary Norton. The series features an evolutionarily improbable race of minuscule people — roughly four inches tall — who live unnoticed within the walls and floors of regular-sized homes, “borrowing” from humans to survive. It’s true that these fantastical beings don’t actually return any of what they borrow, but they also have a strict policy against taking any more than they need, so you can’t fault them too much.
Though the film opens on Shawn, a boy sent to rest in the countryside while awaiting risky heart surgery, its focus quickly shifts to the far more spirited Arrietty, a young and adventurous borrower who lives with her parents beneath Shawn’s new home. The entire concept lends itself very well to a Studio Ghibli production: The premise is inexplicable, but it’s presented in such a matter-of-fact yet whimsical fashion that it’s easy for viewers to get immersed in.
Then there’s the opportunity for visual inventiveness that the story provides: Arrietty’s father uses mundane household utilities to perform fantastic feats of traversal, much to the audience’s delight, and the miniaturized perspective of the tiny people makes even a simple kitchen become a vast, daunting terrain to explore.
The animation in Arrietty is a gorgeous testament to what can still be done in the craft, even when working in two dimensions. The characters and environments are drawn to the peak of crispness, everything beautifully detailed with fluid and expressive movements for the entirety of the film. A steady stream of new and exciting settings and set pieces ensure that no one will forget for a moment that they’re watching an absolute work of art. For proponents of animation, the visual elements alone make the film a must-see.
That’s not all — the other elements of the film hold up as well, including the simple but sincere story that unfolds when Arrietty comes into contact with Shawn and brings very unwanted attention to her own family in the process. The plot can occasionally feel a bit too saccharine, with one of the film’s very last lines in particular eliciting a few well-deserved groans. When a movie wears its heart on its sleeve like this one does, though, it’s hard to fault it too much for an occasional overdose of sentiment.
And there’s the voice cast, which ties everything together rather nicely. Some purists will want to hear the original Japanese dialogue with subtitled English, but whenever Disney localizes a Ghibli film, it takes care of perfectly matching each role to an actor who will do the voice justice. Bridgit Mendler makes an endearing Arrietty, but the true scene-stealers are her parents, voiced by real-life married couple and icons of television comedy, Will Arnett and Amy Poehler.
Poehler voices Arrietty’s mother as a frantic but hilarious bundle of nerves, and Arnett brings out his trademark gravely voice, playing the role completely straight and somehow managing to earn laughs with almost every single line.
With Ponyo in 2009 and even more so now with Arrietty, one increasingly gets the sense that Disney is giving Eastern animation its due, treating these movies as the blockbuster entertainment events that they are in their native Japan. Playing on more than 1,200 screens, more Americans than ever before will have the opportunity to see a Ghibli film in the best way possible: a packed theater.
There is often an almost tangible sense of magic that goes into Studio Ghibli’s anime films, and it’s something that demands to be seen and shared. The Secret World of Arrietty has that spark, and it’s a film that shouldn’t be missed.

Nestled among an eclectic, colorful mix of restaurants and storefronts on famed Sunset Boulevard, a new coffee joint has bravely opened its doors in Hollywood.
Caffeine buzz · Rockpaper Coffee satisfies the hungry customer with its tasty grilled chicken, turkey bacon, egg white and cheese breakfast wrap among other snacks. The coffee, however, is mostly just average. - Jasmine Ako | Daily Trojan
Rockpaper Coffee is easy to pass by because of its small, unassuming storefront. But once customers make their way inside, they’ll encounter a hole-in-the-wall coffee shop aiming to bring an independent, music-infused appeal to the Hollywood community.
An exposed brick wall jumps out as a unique feature of the coffee shop’s interior. A diverse mix of artwork adds character throughout the shop, with album art and music posters hanging alongside playful character portraits of Marvin the Martian from Looney Tunes and Buzz Lightyear of Toy Story.
A music playlist of enjoyable — albeit mainstream — soft rock and acoustic tunes sets the mood for guests — with hits such as Keane’s “Somewhere Only We Know” and Coldplay’s “The Scientist” providing a soothing backdrop.
Rockpaper Coffee’s biggest strength is its broad and affordable array of coffee types to choose from. With a menu that includes espressos, freshly grounded options, iced and blended coffee and freezes, there’s something for even the most selective coffee guzzler. For the non-coffee lovers, the shop offers an assortment of iced tea and all natural fruit and protein smoothies.
So how is the coffee itself? When it boils down to taste and quality, Rockpaper Coffee’s brews unfortunately offer nothing spectacular. One of their specialties, the Spanish latte with condensed milk, is pleasantly frothy and not too sweet. The coffee’s flavor, however, is average and indistinguishable from a cup you could get anywhere else.
For customers seeking a sweet fix, the vanilla cupcake coffee — smoothly undertoned with vanilla — is decent but not revelatory.
Perhaps most disappointing is the shop’s highly touted organic pour-over drip coffee. Though smooth, it lacks flavor and acidity, a quintessential element in an enjoyable cup of coffee. Dangerously akin to instant coffee, it tastes like it wasn’t brewed at a high enough temperature.
But not everything is a miss. The ice-blended caramel latte differentiates itself from similar offerings at The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and Seattle’s Best Coffee by avoiding overt sweetness. A wise choice for tired patrons, the drink gives a caffeinated kick with its strong coffee flavor.
Though the coffee may be underwhelming, Rockpaper Coffee offers a diverse menu of breakfast sandwiches, lunch subs, healthy wraps, salads and assorted snacks for the hungry customer.
One highlight is the chocolate brownie, a delicious cakey square with gooey bits of chocolate chips inside. And, the grilled chicken, turkey bacon, egg white and cheese breakfast wrap is simple and tasty, although it could use an extra kick of flavor.
The shop is also tech-friendly. Customers can conveniently place orders via Twitter, tweet at the servers for a free cup as well (@RPCoffee) or make a phone call through the shop’s iPad checkout and curbside service.
Despite these modern advertising tactics and a pleasant atmosphere, the bottom line is that a coffee joint should have good — if not excellent — coffee in order to stand out. Rockpaper Coffee offers nothing groundbreaking, and it’s doubtful whether USC students will want to venture so far from campus for an average cup of joe and decent grub.
Rockpaper Coffee might be especially worth a stop once its concert and entertainment schedule kicks off, though.
The cafe plans to host nightly shows, stand-up comedy performances and monthly live model drawing classes. If it can transform itself into a lively community hub and amp up its coffee offerings, the shop might just spread its wings.
With its diverse menu and prime location, Rockpaper Coffee is off to a promising start. But if it wants to stand out against the multitude of other coffee offerings, it needs to kick things up a notch.
I just had to comment because I saw this on my Facebook wall and saw how Michael, the owner I think? wrote a personal attack.
That’s extremely unprofessional for you to assume that the writer would be biased – even in my experience going, I remember asking what type of coffee was good and I was given just a blank stare before I was recommended a drip coffee. God was it awful, I actually sent it back and tried it for the Guatemalan, which was just overly bitter. I’d take a Starbucks Arabica over your coffee any day. It’s also way overpriced. I had a cup cost around $4 for a medium.
I want everyone to know that even thinking about driving to RockPaperCoffee is a waste of time. Stick with your Seattle’s Best for a quick fix or just go to Urth Cafe and get coffee for about the same price and infinitely better.
When I went to RockPaperCoffee, I had asked for what was the “Best thing on the menu that was bold and had some sort of acidic base” – I was then told that the Kenyan brew would best emphasize the taste of your coffee beans. Low and behold, it did not. I’ve had Kenyan brew before at Demitasse in Japan Town and my oh my is it a night and day difference.
My friend also ordered a Spanish coffee and that unfortunately, for such a rich beans, showed no tones and lacked that true creaminess that should come with every spanish coffee.
I’m also disappointed that you would attack the author’s credibility because you’re trying to save yourself. Let’s be honest, I was already disappointed when my cup of coffee was not HOT – it was lukewarm at best. What type of coffee shop if any, serves lukewarm coffee? Not one that should be in business, let alone one that thinks it could generate thousands of dollars off it. It also doesn’t help that it took me three passes before I could find your location – don’t come running at me saying I’m blind because my GPS told me it was on the right and I literally couldn’t find it.
I would highly recommend you stay away from this place. I would have given this place another chance, but Michael seems like the type of guy who’s just way too over himself for me to even consider another try.
Now Demitasse, that’s what I call great customer service & eager baristas that want to teach.
Oh you go there too? it’s a great place for some nice coffee and I love the guys behind the counter. really cool dudes.
Jack’s signature drink, the one with the thai team creme on glace? DELICIOUS. & when i’m on a time crunch but in the area, the minty cubano is definitely my go-to drink. Yeah definitely, the service is great.
tea*
I would have loved it if i had known ALL of this when I was at your coffee shop. Usually when I go to great coffee shops, the baristas there are eager to teach and express some of the best products that they have in store without customers having to do much pushing and shoving. We were thrown one menu where all of us crowded around. When it started taking a while for all of us to make a decision, a barista could have let us know the specials there. 
The truth of the matter was the store was understaffed and underdeveloped in customer service in many ways. It was a lazy Sunday afternoon, so I didn’t care as much that service was slow. But if you expect “thousands of dollars in potential business” and your coffee shop to hit success, Sunday afternoons are going to be your prime.
This is an unfair review. You’re judging all of our coffee based on one bean which wasn’t even our organic! At any time we are brewing 3 different beans one light and 2 dark roasts. You had our Costa Rican bean which is known for it’s sweetness and LOW ACIDITY. Had you tried our Kenyan or Organic Guatemalan then you could at least make a fair judgment. We are the only cafe within a 2 mile radius that does pour over brew correctly.  
Before you cost a new business thousands of dollars in potential business right at it’s launch perhaps you could do a professional review. I invite any of you to come in again to give us a real rating. 
An additional note. Our live shows have been going for 3 weeks already.

As a volunteer health teacher in public high schools, I spend a lot of time telling ninth-grade girls how the government makes it easy for them to access basic methods of birth control. I’ve seen firsthand how vital access is; for some young women, federal contraceptive initiatives are the only reason they aren’t mothers of two by age 18.
The potential for positive impact motivated the federal mandate that employers include contraceptive coverage in their health insurance packages.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
The decision left multiple religious groups infuriated. In the interest of mollifying these groups, Obama announced Friday a new accommodation that exempted religiously affiliated employers from the mandate.
This compromise is too generous. Only institutions serving a primary function that is specifically religious should be eligible for such an exemption.
People who work for religious institutions are hired specifically to employ their faith within the community; adhering to religious principles is literally in their job description. In cases where faith considers birth control morally wrong, these individuals should not expect contraceptive coverage.
But employees of institutions such as hospitals and schools that are merely religiously affiliated should expect it. Many of these employees may follow a different religion or lack religious affiliation. They should not face more difficulty obtaining contraceptives merely because their bosses deem them immoral.
Employers providing contraception in their insurance packages still retain their right to worship and to believe what they want. They are not being forced to provide contraceptives in the name of their faith or to use it themselves.
But the new exemption means a female teacher at a Catholic high school will see a significant aspect of her life — her access to birth control — impinged on by beliefs that are not her own.
Meanwhile, employment prospects remain limited for many other women, whose need for contraceptive coverage deters them from jobs that make obtaining it more difficult and more costly.
Religious freedom aside, contraception is an accepted component of women’s health in medical communities nationwide.
Even more importantly, it acts as a social good. According to the Huffington Post, it costs the government millions of taxpayer dollars a year to provide medical services, welfare and adoptive homes for countless surprise children.
In extending health care coverage to contraception, the federal government acted in the interests of social health and women’s rights nationwide. Higher-ups at religiously affiliated institutions can believe what they want, but they should not be allowed to shirk their responsibility for the health of their unaffiliated employees.

I’m not sure where everyone is getting this idea that Obama’s “accommodation” now exempts Catholic hospitals, schools, and other religiously affiliated employers from the mandate. It doesn’t. Obama’s “accommodation” simply made it so that all insurance companies now have to provide contraception in their policies. Catholic organizations are not exempt- they will be paying the higher costs of insurance to cover contraception in their policies. Only churches are exempt. It is clear that you don’t completely understand the issue. This is not about whether the employees of these organizations follow a different religion, or even whether the employers themselves think contraception is ok. The problem is that these are religiously-based institutions, and Catholic teaching is clearly opposed to birth control. It IS an attack on religion, because these institutions are being forced to go against the teachings of their religion.
it’s scary how clueless you are..  This means that you will get less in your paycheck now thanks to this nonsese.. This policy is why tution and health insurance is so expensive.. See if you can figure it out.. When something is “free” it means it will be VERY expensive as there will no longer be market forces disciplining them because the goverment will pay for it by taxing us and employers will be charging new fees and will take more from your paycheck.

It seems that February has been the month of contraceptive controversy in the United States. In addition to the Susan G. Komen debacle, heated arguments over mandating coverage for contraception under President Barack Obama’s health care legislation pushed the topic to the forefront of public discourse.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act stipulates that all employers provide insurance coverage for free contraception by 2013.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
To appease the many critics of this plan, Obama announced that churches would be exempt from the requirement. Employers with religious affiliations, such as Catholic hospitals or Episcopal schools, are also exempt from the mandate.
In doing so, the government has upheld our First Amendment right to religious freedom.
Forcing any employer running a religiously affiliated institution to provide coverage for something that contradicts that religion’s principles is simply unconstitutional.
As post-sexual revolution college students, most of us probably accept contraception and view it as a viable component of a healthy lifestyle.
But the government should not force employers to become the providers. The use of contraceptives should be up to the individual. Similarly, the decision to provide coverage for employees of a religious institution must be left to the employer.
Whether the employees of these institutions are of the same faith as their employers is irrelevant.
What matters is that the institution is founded on the principles of a certain religion. Employees of religiously affiliated institutions often represent many different faiths. But in making the choice to work at a place with a religious foundation, these people tacitly consent to adhere to some of the religion’s defining principles. This tacit consent should include an understanding that their employer will not provide them with something that contradicts tenets of the founding religion.
If a prospective employee wishes to be provided coverage for birth control by its employer, it would be logical for the employee to steer clear of religious institutions that would be averse to providing contraceptives. Otherwise, the employee can seek contraception elsewhere.
As we enter the workforce, we will have to choose which jobs suit us best — and how much value we place on our employers’ ability to provide coverage for contraception.
Though contraception is undoubtedly important to many people and must remain accessible and affordable for all, religiously affiliated institutions and organizations must not be forced to provide it.
Let’s hope we emerge from USC into a work environment that values women’s health and the unimpeded exercise of religion. Using one as an excuse to trump the other is not acceptable in a free society.

No –
How can you have privacy when someone else is paying for contraception? Think about all the food stamp users that thought they could visit ATMs in casinos; You have no privacy when you accept government control.
To force the costs of a private decision on another is not freedom or liberty, it is tyranny.
I agree that the government should not force employers to become the providers of contraception. However, you are mistaken that employers with religious affiliations are exempt. Catholic hospitals and schools have never been exempt from Obama’s mandate; only churches have. Additionally, Obama’s “accommodation” does not change a thing. It now says all insurance companies must provide free contraception. Catholic employers will still be paying higher costs for insurance, and being forced to go against the teachings of the Church.

It’s always a sad day in the music world when a legend who influenced generations of artists passes away. Whitney Elizabeth Houston, the iconic singer with the monumental voice, died this past week on February 11, in her bathtub at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
Houston’s death hit close to home for many, including godmother Aretha Franklin, friend Mariah Carey and even ex-husband Bobby Brown, while the death of such a musical icon inspired numerous tributes including Jennifer Hudson’s emotional rendition of “I Will Always Love You” at the Grammys.
Houston suffered late-life issues with drug abuse, which triggered health problems and a lack of professionalism, including the utterance of her notorious quote concerning crack cocaine during her 2002 interview with Diane Sawyer.
Still, there is no denying Houston’s significance to not just the music world, but to the entire entertainment industry. Houston helped break down the color barrier for black female artists during the 1980s when it was difficult for black artists to get air-time on major networks, most notably MTV. She paved the way for other artists like Anita Baker and Janet Jackson and went on to influence numbers of pop-flavored artists such as Mariah Carey, Destiny’s Child, Robin Thicke, Alicia Keys and Celine Dion.
Houston amazed the nation in 1991 with her powerful, stunning rendition of “The Star Spangled Banner” at Super Bowl XXV. She charmed and thrilled the music world with hits through the decades like “How Will I Know,” “The Greatest Love of All,” “I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)” and the unforgettable “I Will Always Love You,” which was the hit song of The Bodyguard soundtrack, the successful film in which Houston starred alongside Kevin Costner in 1992.
Houston’s popularity, talent and influence are reflected in her achievements.
She received the most amount of awards for a female artist of all time, having a total of 415 career awards by 2010, including her astonishing eight wins at the 21st American Music Awards of 1994, tying with Michael Jackson.
There has been a resurgence in Houston’s catalogue sales since her death, comprised of the sales of over one million albums and singles, the majority being the nearly 900,000 digital singles purchased.
Clearly, despite her tragic passing, Whitney Houston’s music lives on in the hearts of old fans as well a new generation of listeners.
Houston’s funeral is scheduled for this Saturday.

At the height of the Vietnam War, universities were the place to be for students wanting to make a difference in the world. On any given day, students could engage in discussion about the war, often with prominent figures such as Daniel Ellsburg.
Worldly · Vice Dean for Academic Programs Steven Lamy has taught abroad. - Courtesy of USC
“Universities were alive with this very complex, difficult debate about America’s role in the war,” said Vice Dean for Academic Programs Steven Lamy. “If you looked out the window at any university, there was a discussion about the war and people were mobilized.”
After spending about a year abroad, in Belgium and the Netherlands, and hearing about the war from a college campus, Lamy began rethinking his plans to use his studies in history and political science to become a lawyer. He was more interested in researching, and decided to attend the Graduate School of International Studies at University of Denver for his Ph.D.
Now, at USC, Lamy has translated his experience into teaching.
“The key thing is active learning,” he said. “The idea of active learning is not passively sitting there listening to a lecture, but interaction: talking in class, using case studies and doing exercises.”
One of his strategies to get students involved is a research exercise, Beyond Google: Basic Tools for Research in International Relations. He said that rather than having teaching assistants spend discussion sections restating lectures, he gives the students work to discuss, such as an exercise that asks students to search for various publications that provide information on a variety of topics, from South African foreign policy to who won the Biafra Civil War.
“[This] generation believes you can find everything on Google,” Lamy said. “My idea is, rather than say, ‘This is a journal,’ say, ‘Go find it.’ The idea is that you give them something like this to do and they develop skills to use later.”
Lamy also suggests students learn through teaching, so he created the Teaching International Relations Program, placing about 200 USC students in local high schools to teach a series of lessons on international relations. He said students also stand to learn more about the subject through the creation and teaching of their lessons.
“You do learn a lot about not only yourself, but about the field that you’re teaching when you attempt to teach,” Lamy said.
Lamy taught at the University of Transkei in South Africa during the apartheid, where he realized the value of education when a student stayed after class one night to apologize for falling asleep during class. The student told Lamy that he woke up at six every morning, spent the day teaching at a school in his village, then took four buses to the university for night classes. The student said he wanted to have a degree to teach when  the apartheid was reformed. Lamy said the student attended class every night, and that was the only night he had ever fallen asleep.
“[This interaction] said to me that I’d better prepare very well,” Lamy said. “I can’t take this lightly. It set up the notion that we both have responsibility: The student has responsibility and I have responsibility. You come to learn, and I come to learn with you.”
Lamy’s work also took him to Eastern European countries, such as Russia and Estonia, at the end of the Cold War, as part of a program to develop case studies and to show university professors abroad how to teach international relations. Now, he stresses to his students the importance of traveling to learn more. He runs Problems without Passports, a program that provides short-term summer courses on global issues by taking students around the world. Past studies have taken students to Belize, Palau and Guam.
This summer, a group of students is traveling to the Arctic to research climate change. They will begin in Finland and end in Lapland, stopping in several other countries along the way to learn about global perspectives on the issue.
“It’s the idea of seeing the world from a different perspective,” Lamy said. “They have a different way of seeing things and that’s what study abroad does. The programs we’ve designed are short-term, but they’re appetizers. We hope that someone will go abroad and say, ‘It doesn’t hurt to go abroad, you can really learn something.’”

In the midst of the athletic department’s yearlong celebration of USC’s Olympic successes, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge spoke Wednesday at Town & Gown as part of Annenberg’s Sports and Social Change Speaker Series.
Sporting events · Alan Abrahamson, a professor of journalism who covered the 1984 Summer Olympics, asked International Olympic President Jacques Rogge about the economic impact of the Olympics on host cities. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
The discussion, hosted by Alan Abrahamson, a professor of journalism, covered a variety of topics, including the 1984 Summer Olympics, held in Los Angeles, and focused on the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“The 1984 Olympics left a tremendous legacy for this city,” Rogge said.
Because Italian Premier Mario Monti had ended Rome’s bid for the 2020 Summer Games because of financial concerns on Tuesday, the conversation turned quickly to the sustainability of the Olympic ideal and the impact of real-world incidents on the Games.
“Sport is not in a vacuum,” Rogge said. “Sport is part of society.”
Scott Blackmun, CEO of the United States Olympic Committee, also spoke at the event and highlighted the financial and logistical difficulty of hosting the Olympic Games on U.S. soil, stating the USOC was hesitant to submit a bid for the 2022 Winter Games.
“So much of the process depends on the [surrounding] circumstances, including support in Washington, D.C. … and the mood of the nation,” Blackmun said.
USC — which has had 393 total athletes associated with the university compete in the Games — and Southern California are intrinsically tied to the Games, Abrahamson said.
“There’s something special about Southern California,; it’s the weather — it’s great training conditions,” Abrahamson said. “[And] of course USC is a fantastic world-class university that has some world-class coaches and thinkers. Who wouldn’t want to be here?”
USC’s 258 combined Olympic medals — 122 of which are gold — would rank USC No. 18 among countries if the university competed as a country. Many of those medals have come as a result of the USC men’s and women’s swimming and diving team, coached by Dave Salo.
“It’s unwritten law that [this team is] not just a collegiate program; we’re responsible for training athletes for the Olympic Games,” Salo said.
Salo, who will serve as an assistant coach for the women’s swim team at the 2012 Olympics in London, has seen support from the athletic department and the administration.
“USC really supports our presence on the Olympic team,” Salo said. “It’s very important to USC. [Athletic Director] Pat Haden has clearly demonstrated that we want to celebrate our Olympic heritage and that we want our coaches, whatever sport, on Olympic staffs.”
Swimmer Rebecca Soni, who medaled three times — one gold, two silver — at the 2008 Olympics while still a student at USC, is now part of Salo’s extended graduate program, which combines with the undergraduate program to give USC “one of the world’s greatest swim programs,” according to Abrahamson.
Kevin Rutkowski, a junior majoring in political science and theater, said USC’s persona encourages the success the school’s alumni have seen at the Olympics.
“We have the resources available and the drive to compete [at USC],” Rutkowski said. “We do our best to balance sports and academics and we all try to excel in all fields, which attracts better athletes.”

Presidental candidate Jared Ginsburg said he plans to file an elections complaint that the official Facebook page for Undergraduate Student Government was hacked during voting for USG elections.
USG officials said at around 5:30 p.m. that a hack did occur, but said at 11 p.m. that they could neither confirm nor deny a hack.
“No one from [USG] communications or technology posted [the status] so we cannot confirm that they actually ever appeared on the page,” said Sabena Suri, USG senior director of communications.
Screenshot courtesy of Jared Ginsburg
Statuses allegedly appeared on the USG page urging followers to vote for the presidential ticket of Mikey Geragos and Vinnie Prasad, according to screenshots taken by Ginsburg. The hacks were discovered around 3:45 p.m. Wednesday, Ginsburg said.
The Facebook accounts of students who publicly supported Ginsburg’s campaign also posted the same status supporting Geragos and Prasad, Ginsburg said.
According to the screenshots, the statuses posted by the students’ accounts and USG’s page read: “Vote Mikey/Vinnie for USG Pres and VP!!”
Suri said USG’s communication and technology team determined no USG members had posted the comments on the page.
USG members and programs cannot endorse or support a specific candidate, according to article IX, section D of the USG elections code.
Ginsburg said Wednesday night that his campaign is planning to file an official election complaint Thursday morning.
After a complaint is filed, an election commission comprised of five students would have 24 hours to review the case and decide whether to proceed or dismiss the case. If they choose to hear the case, the commission would have 24 hours to make a ruling. A video of the commission meeting would be released the next day.
“The election commission is responsible for coming up with any and all punishments and repercussions for any action that is brought before them,” said Elise Fabbro, USG co-director of elections and recruitment.
Geragos said his campaign was not involved with the Facebook hacks.
“I am extremely committed to running a fair campaign so I personally investigated the Facebook hacking allegations from another candidate,” Geragos said. “The only person who saw these statuses live on Facebook seems to be Jared.”
Geragos said his research found that the allegedly hacked statuses of individual Facebook users showed the same location and time stamps as election-related statuses that were posted on the hacking victim’s walls.
“I’m definitely not taking these allegations lightly,” Geragos said. “I’m reserving the right to file a complaint. I haven’t decided yet because I would like to do a little more investigating, but it’s definitely on the table.”
Ginsburg said his campaign was investigating the incident by contacting Facebook and the hack victims before filing an official complaint.
“We are speaking to many of the individuals who had their Facebooks hacked,” Ginsburg said. “We are trying to get in contact with Facebook to find out what happened. We are trying to get in contact with whomever we possibly can to figure out who is responsible for this.”
According to the screenshot, the first update from USG’s page supporting Geragos’ ticket was posted at about 7 p.m., 21 hours before the screenshots were taken.
“It has been [up for] almost a full day of the voting period, and USG has several hundred, if not a thousand, followers who may have seen that post and thus had their vote influenced one way or another,” Ginsburg said.
USG has nearly 1,500 followers on Facebook.
Voting ends Thursday and preliminary results will be released Feb. 21. The official results will be announced the following week.
I am deeply troubled by the apparent cheating that one candidates representatives have undertaken to sway the election their way.   I would have hoped that more ethical people would run for office at USC then the group currently trying to get elected.   Parents should have a opportunity to vote or veto any unsuitable candidate as we are paying for all the “fun and mayhem” wrought by our children
Anyone who is friends with Mikey on Facebook can attest–there is no status that looks like this on his page. Even if he was hacked (and he says he wasn’t), why would he have deleted a post that supports his own campaign? Something sounds fishy–there are websites that do exactly what is shown in the screenshot: they can change a status to say one thing in a photo, but they do not appear on Facebook itself.
we get it… you are a sigma chi
We get it, you’re bitter, Greek. Not every Mikey/Vinnie supporter is a Sigma Chi… or even in the greek system.
VOTING IS OVER! EVERYONE CAN SHUT THE **** UP! WHO CARES
While running for a similar position in high school, the signs/ campaign material of one of Mikey’s opponents also mysteriously disappeared.  Now his largest competition is arguably at a disadvantage because of a similar instance, in addition to these Facebook hacking allegations, which Mikey probably also didn’t do himself, but someone in his camp probably executed.  And if I’m not mistaken, Mikey’s responsible for these action’s according to some USC code.
As for the security of Facebook, for anyone not familiar with comp-sci, it is astoundingly not difficult to hack someone’s Facebook.
Anyway, coming from a fairly open opinion, Mikey and Theo are a joke.  Visit all 3 of the candidates’ websites and watch the debate yourself:  http://www.atvn.org/news/2012/02/usg-debate
Jared clearly appears like front-runner and it seems like, (in my opinion), Mikey’s a bit sleazy.
Hahaha. No he is not. Learn your laws. Read up, seriously! Do you go to UCLA?
It’s amazing you can post this BS. Why don’t you contact Mikey’s high school opponent yourself and get the facts before you make your stupid allegations. He never did anything like you are mentioning.  Running to the Daily Trojan and continually trying to smear ones opponent is what truly constitutes sleazy. Get your facts.
If you’re trying to dig up dirt on Mikey from his high school days, I have one word for you: Weinergate.
Did anyone else just get spammed by the Jared/Sam campaign with instructions on how to vote for them? How did they get access to all the student addresses at usc?
yep happened to me too. ignored it at the time but this reminded me. not sure how they got my personal email.

I got spammed by them too. Except it was even spammier – it came from someone’s USC email and had the subject “hey how are you?”. so shady.
(PS – I am a grad student, I don’t even think I’m eligible to vote for this)
Why are you reading the daily trojan or following this campaign? YOU ARE NOT AN UNDERGRAD.
This is an absolute joke. Why is it in the 24 hours that this was up, no one else saw it? How would this benefit Mikey and Vinnie vs. what could come out of it? Hacking 16 people? Seriously, for what like 30 more votes? Do you know how hard it is to hack into 1 persons facebook, let alone 16? No one would waste their time on that for such little benefit…
Exactly, wheras for Jared and Sam… knocking out their competition?! Insane amounts of benefits
SHUT UP WHO CARES. GO LIVE YOUR LIFE
Haha, why’d you even bother to comment if you are living your life?
It seems unrealistic that every person posting about these candidates would use two exclamation points and the exact same style. Every post I’ve seen regarding candidates varies the way they urge people to vote. It looks like Photoshop to me.
Guys… this is all over a popularity contest… please invest your passion and anger over real issues.
I’m not in support of any of the parties.. I honestly don’t think the winner of this election will change USC regardless. I’m only posting because i think its HILARIOUS that some people think there is no possibility this was photoshopped…. I could personally photoshop something like this in less than 10 minutes. Not saying he did… but it is defiantly an easy process and everyone who says “a picture is proof” has no idea what my skills are anyone who has played around with the program for 20 minutes can do. 
Best of luck to the three tickets.
A few commenters say that people have seen the screenshots. But how did no one see any of the statuses on actual Facebook for 21 hours???? It’s Facebook. People are on it all day and after 21 hours no one noticed a problem. It seems to me there probably was not one…..
America The Free, read my post. Does it sound hateful? No it does not. Your post is only inciting more of this behavior you are allegedly condemning. A few examples of bullying from your own post:
“Shame on you little boys”
“sleazy frat houses”
“Go back to your silly video”
“Ya, rap your way out of this one.”
“Pleeezzzz, we are informed, smart citizens who smell a rat.”
“ignorant campaign supporters”
None of these quotes are taken out of context. YOU are the bully. Bullies share their opinions by using hurtful language. Before you make accusations check your self.
Thanks John!
The Screenshot speaks for itself. I think we can all agree that Mikey nor Vinnie personally did this. BUT someone who is obviously supporting their campaign did…
One of the alleged status hacks was mine, I wrote on my status to vote mikey, he did not hack it. 
and i say again, VOTE MIKEY FOR USG PRES.

LETS SETTLE IT BITCHES
DAILY TROJAN POST THE EVIDENCE OR WHATEVER SO PEOPLE CAN STOP ARGUING AND MAKING ERRONEOUS CLAIMS
None of us know what is going on so everyone needs to shut up. Let the candidates figure it out for themselves. No one would photoshop this. As if anyone has the time. None of the complaints filed are “bogus.” everyone deserves the right to file. Because someone is victimized, they should just shut up and not confront the issue? 
GO FOCUS ON CLASS because none of you are in USG so none of you know what you are talking about.
Americathefree, I am not greek, I am not voting for anyone, hell I am a graduate student. But if you are going to post a comment accusing people of bullying and “spewing venom” you should do it using proper English. A few pieces of advice: 1. You mean to say “voters” not votes, votes dont talk. 2. ashame and a shame are not the same thing, look it up. 3. Squeeze in a few commas instead of ands. Once you have changed these things your comment will approach a C level writing 140 paper.
So true. Way to trash around the reputation of USC.
Teeheehee, Grammar Police. And I apologize for any grammar mistakes I may have made myself.
Thanks for the heads up. I’ll proofread.
OOOOOHHH BUUUURRRRRNNNN. “Hell, I’m a graduate student!” – Grammar Police 2012
I don’t think it is fair to form staunch opinions either way for now. The situation is far from clear and is very complex, and the hearing should allow us in the public a better view of what happened.
That being said, I do see how sketchy this looks for Jared. I mean, I think that the only was this should EVER be ruled on is if others  (NEUTRAL others) claim to have seen the posts as well. If, as Ginsburg suggested, they were us all day then it will be nearly impossible to NOT find someone who has seen them. If not though, I find myself thinking about how easy Photoshop is….
If Jared’s complaint is legit, then fair enough. If we are to find out it isn’t though, I feel as though THEY should receive some punishment, as their continual accusations have ultimately hurt Mikey and Vinnie as well as Theo and Julia.
Clearly another bully on Mikey’s pulpit pretending to be fair. Mikey broke rules, lied and cheated whether he himself or his supporters/frat bros. A photo is evidence of the hacked page. No one makes up a photo. There were 4 people in the room that saw the same hacked page up on line. Mikey is a cheater hiding behind his shameful frat bros at worst or ignorant campaign supporters at best. Its like men who hate women, guys who say a woman wanted to be raped, that she did it to herself. Well, Mikey chose to steal and lie, then say his opponents did it. Pleeezzzz, we are informed, smart citizens who smell a rat.
Hell, I’m a photographer. Dude, people get PAID TO PHOTOSHOP. WTF? CONSPIRACY? I WROTE IN HERMAN CAIN.

BITCHES
PEACE
You make all of these comments about “frat bros” so why do you never acknowledge that both Sam and Jared are members of the Greek community? Why do you not attack the fact that a large part of their campaign emphasized the fact that they were “the only greek ticket?” It seems unfair to bash Mikey because he is in a frat,but not do the same to Jared and Sam.
Mikey is the only one in a top tier frat.  Really only top tier by reputation long since gone
Here are Mikey’s frat bros spewing venom and bullying. Shame on you little boys.It is clear you are scared and doing whatever bullying and stealing and cheating things you can get away with. But, the votes are not stupid. Follow the money…who benefits from stealing a candidates signs (their opponent, Mikey to say it specifically). Who benefits from hacking into an authorized university website (and the FB page photographed) promoting to vote for a candidate named in the hack (Mikey again)…oops..Mikey and his frat boys give Greeks a bad name. Its ashame that your are endorsed by two sleazy frat houses. It is clear the other candidates are running a clean, honorable campaign based on a solid, well thought out platform. You can’t lie and cheat and bully your way out of this with your lies and cover ups.  Go back to your silly video you raced to put up in the last couple days. Ya, rap your way out of this one.
This article seems to demonstrate that Jared made this up. All these USG people who had hacked statuses that were up 21 hours and not one of them checked Facebook and saw them? None of them got any notifications? Why can’t anyone in USG confirm this if it happened? If Mikey can hack Facebook, change everyone’s status without them knowing, then get everyone to not check their own Facebook for 21 hours. Then face it, he is either the Napster or Chuck Norris in which case you won’t beat him anyways…..
I have seen the screen shots of the posts.. definitely not made up or “photoshopped” 
I would obviously deny the fact too if this happened to my campaign.
This is a bogus complain by two Sam and Jared. First the signs now hacking. I think running around making accusations speaks to the characters of Sam and Jared. Implying that other candidates were involved is even worst. Anyone that knows Theo and Julia and Mikey and Vinnie knows that they are all honest, hardworking, and committed students. Jared will never be able to contact Facebook, Facebook does not care for bogus complains. As for the comments above I  would like to ask supporters of Sam and Jared (few as they are) to not troll this article and use their time in a different and more productive way.
It is called standing up to bullies. I call on every person whether gay, straight, woman, man, black, brown, yellow, white, christian, jew, muslim…whoever is attacked by bullies to stand up to them and not be intimidated. The big frat boy mentality gives USC a bad name so Mikey’s frat bros need to go back under the rock from which they came.
You don’t have ANYTHING better to do right now?
America The Free, read my post. Does it sound hateful? No it does not. Your post is only inciting more of this behavior you are allegedly condemning.  A few examples of bullying from your own post: 
“Shame on you little boys”
“sleazy frat houses”
“Go back to your silly video”
“Ya, rap your way out of this one.”
“Pleeezzzz, we are informed, smart citizens who smell a rat.”
“ignorant campaign supporters”
None of these quotes are taken out of context. YOU are the bully. Bullies share their opinions by using hurtful language. Before you make accusations check your self.
Bogus? Having $1000 worth of signs stolen is bogus? Do you even know that that money comes out of their pocket? It is not bogus. You will feel stupid once the evidence is posted on the daily trojan.
Mikey, you should feel ashamed of yourself. You are blatantly lying and have been since day one. I feel bad for Vinnie because he does not deserve this. In high school you stole signs, anything you could do to cheat your way to the top. We all know you are a manipulative liar. Too bad it is just coming out now on the last day of elections how unworthy you are of representing the school. At the end of his high school commencement he goes “Sorry I did not do anything”… is that what USC wants as a president?
Since you’re claiming that Mikey is a liar, do you have any proof of Mikey stealing signs in high school or do you have a copy of his commencement speech to prove that you aren’t lying yourself?
Shame on you Mikey. Resorting to stealing signs and hacking the USG facebook for self-promotion, you and your frat bros and campaign supporters have no moral compass and are not worthy of representing the 16,000 student undergraduates. Who do you think you are to lie and cheat to win an election? Students here know what you did in your high school election, hmmm where opponents signs disappeared. People have your number Mikey. You can’t hide behind your big frat bros any more. USC is a world class educational institution. Look at you.
Come on people, can’t we just all get along?
