The Undergraduate Student Government Elections Commission found that “no infraction occurred” with the Mai & Brianna presidential ticket after holding a hearing Monday evening, according to an official election verdict published Wednesday.
According to the verdict, an individual alleged that someone was involved with presidential candidate Mai Mizuno and vice presidential candidate Brianna Bozek’s election campaign before the official start of campaigning on Jan. 25.
“The Commission found, based on presented evidence, that the petitioners could not prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the respondent’s had violated Elections Code,” the verdict said. “The Mai & Brianna ticket bears no accountability for the evidence presented during this hearing.”
A source within USG explained to the Daily Trojan that the reporting party alleged Mizuno’s campaign team had reached out to someone who was not a member of their five-person team to help create multimedia before campaign season officially began.
USG Senior Director of Communications Daniel Zhu confirmed that the verdict had to do with a “graphic-related” issue. 
Earlier in the day, Zhu, in a statement to the Daily Trojan, had said that the verdict had been in regards to “suspicion that a candidate’s website was posted early.” He later retracted that statement.
According to the Elections Code XIII.D, “a written copy of the transcript will be released to both the general public and the press. An official copy of the transcript shall be available in the USG office for public consumption as soon as a verdict is reached.”
The Daily Trojan requested an official transcript copy of Monday’s hearing on Wednesday afternoon, but was denied.
Emily Quirke, the associate director of elections and recruitment, said the Monday hearing had not yet been transcribed. Quirke and Zhu both said USG would try to make the transcript available to the public within 24 hours. Zhu attributed the delay to technical difficulties.
Zhu added that USG is “thinking of ways to speed up the process” of sharing hearing transcripts in the future. He did not specify what sanctions, if any, would be imposed on the commission for violating Elections Code XIII.D.
The Mai & Brianna ticket declined to comment on the outcome of the hearing, citing Elections Code XIII.C.2, which says that speaking to the press regarding hearings can result in a sanction for involved parties.
The Debbie & Blake presidential ticket said in a statement to the Daily Trojan: “Our team respects the decision of the Elections Committee regarding the hearing and we wish to stay neutral as we proceed into our campaign.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misspelled Emily Quirke’s name. It has since been updated with the correct spelling. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Photo of Logan Paul from Twitter
YouTube is arguably at the peak of its rise as a democratized platform for producing and sharing videos. Whether your interests lie in cooking or watching your favorite YouTube personalities talk about their day, a tailored subscription box means you can have everything (and everyone) you care about at your fingertips.
What happens, however, when the usual fare in your YouTube feed is replaced with something much darker? YouTube creator Logan Paul, visited the legendary Suicide Forest in Japan during December, (where over 100 people a year go to end their lives).  There, he came across a man who had recently hanged himself, and showed the body on camera to his millions of fans amid laughs of disbelief and surprise from his crew.
“Depression is not a joke. Suicide is not a joke,” Paul said solemnly in front of the body, only to laugh raucously in the parking lot outside the forest just moments later.
To children, YouTubers can be idols — an ideal to aspire toward, or a lesson that hard work makes the dream work. Logan Paul and his crew show his subscribers many things, none of which are good. To them, running around and cracking jokes in a forest renowned for its deep pain and sorrow is something that’s OK. This sort of behavior sends the message that posting a video like this is alright as long as you say a few words about mental illness beforehand. 
YouTube’s reaction to the Logan Paul situation has been lukewarm at best. They’ve cut business ties with him, unscheduled a YouTube TV show about him and have demonetized the infamous video he posted on New Year’s Eve. However, the real problem here is that his channel isn’t off the internet — and here’s why.
The fiasco surrounding the Suicide Forest video has now receded slightly, and Logan Paul has started to upload content as usual. Here’s where he stands after the video: with 400,000 new subscribers, the same like-dislike ratio on his videos and the same view count that he had before the Japan vlog that should have sent his career six-feet underground.
Should a man that violated the privacy of a man and his family in their darkest time be let go with nothing but a slap on the wrist? Paul’s receiving nothing but more attention, and in the YouTube sphere, no publicity is bad publicity. 
Here, YouTube’s doing nothing more than mildly punishing a man who sat at his desk, edited together this vlog and thought, “This is OK,” as he pressed upload. How could this not set a precedent for the millions of YouTubers out there who work hard on content every day?
The problem here isn’t just the appalling nature of the vlog he uploaded: it’s that sensationalist nonsense and clickbait titles drive attention away from the genuinely hardworking content creators who make YouTube their full-time job.
“If I’m going to die tonight, I’m going to do it in my Gucci jacket,” said Logan Paul as he entered the suicide forest with a camera at the ready.
While Logan Paul is certainly at the root of this problem, his viewers — including us — are part of it too, with a significant part of his viewer demographic comprising teenagers above the age of 15. Whether you watch his videos ironically or you’re a genuine fan, you’re helping support a man whose experience with mental illness oscillates between ignorance and disrespect. 
On average, there are 123 suicides a day, with most of these people being young adults or elderly people. So if YouTube won’t eschew Logan Paul, perhaps it’s time for us to think about who we support. Because videos like these, as despicable as they are, are what put that Gucci jacket on his back and the notion in his mind that if you have a large enough audience, you’re invincible.
If you’re in crisis or you need someone to talk to, the Engemann Student Health Center has a counseling department that’s free for student use.

Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Finding yourself daydreaming when you should be studying? Getting frustrated by your lack of efficiency? Here are some tried and true tips to help you churn out homework assignments with maximum focus and productivity.

1. Turn your phone on silent
Why would you want to look at diagrams of the Krebs cycle when you could be looking at your friends’ cute Instagram pics from Santa Monica? Don’t give in; mute your phone so you can’t get distracted. If you still find yourself impulsively checking your home screen for notifications, turn off the notifications for your messaging and social media apps.
2. Use your phone for your benefit
I’ve discovered a small squadron of apps that are effective fighters on the front lines against distraction. One is Focus Keeper, an app that utilizes the Pomodoro Technique for studying. It’s a timer that cycles between long and short blocks of time, so you can study in 20-minute sessions and take five-minute breaks in between. Another good app is Self Control, which allows you to create a list of websites that can be blocked for a set amount of time (up to 24 hours!). Goodbye illicit Netflix binges; hello completed research paper.
3. Find a quiet place to study
If you’re not a library person, there are still plenty of peaceful places on campus that don’t get much foot traffic. Try a bench near the aptly named Little Chapel of Silence or the rooftop of Old Annenberg.
4.  . . . Or get a study buddy
Find someone who will keep you accountable, not someone who will distract you with YouTube videos of skateboarding parakeets.

5. Get plenty of sleep
Nothing’s harder than trying to slog through an ancient text like Plato’s Republic if you can’t keep your eyes open. Getting a minimum of eight hours of sleep will keep you alert (and more cheerful) during your studies.

6. Reduce sugar
While you may justify eating that candy bar by saying it boosts your focus, the opposite is actually true: sugar impedes memory and learning skills and even negatively affects your emotional health. If you really need a little mid-study pick-me-up, try a square of dark chocolate.
7. Make a plan the night before
When feeling overwhelmed by the tsunami of work overtaking you, make a detailed plan before you go to bed that outlines each task you need to work on the next day. Be specific; schedule what time and how long you will work on each task. Don’t set unrealistic expectations for yourself, and definitely don’t overload.

8. Take a break
When you find yourself reaching the two-hour mark and you’re still wrestling with that one diabolical chemistry problem, now is not the best time to prove your persistence. The logical thing to do is step away for a few minutes. Take a walk to clear your head, and give your brain the chance to refresh before you return to the problem.

9. Work now, play later
It is important to stay focused on your studies during the time you designate so that you have time for the things you enjoy. Never go through the agony of saying, “Sorry, I can’t go out tonight. I have an essay I have to write,” again.
10. But don’t put too much pressure on yourself
A little healthy pressure can be great to keep you motivated, but too much stress will just be counterproductive. Relax. One homework assignment isn’t going to make or break your academic career.

(From left to right) Bloomberg View journalist Francis Wilkinson, CNN and Fox News commentator James Lacy, author Lynn Vavreck and The New York Times’ Los Angeles Bureau Chief Adam Nagourney discussed the role of polarization in Donald Trump’s presidency. Autria Mashian | Daily Trojan
The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics featured four panelists in Tuesday’s “One Year into the Trump Administration” event at Wallis Annenberg Hall. 
The event aimed to provide analytical insight into President Donald Trump’s first year in office and his first official State of the Union address. 
The panel included Bloomberg View journalist Francis Wilkinson, The New York Times’ Los Angeles Bureau Chief Adam Nagourney, author Lynn Vavreck and CNN and Fox News commentator James Lacy. Jessica Yellin, who previously served as the Chief White House Correspondent for CNN, moderated the conversation.
The panel emphasized the issue of polarization in the current political climate. According to Vavrek, this polarization throughout the nation has defined the past year of Trump’s presidency and the 2016 election.
“Part of what’s hard about this moment in time in America politically is the separation between the two parties,” Vavreck said. “It’s now fully transformed. The parties are so different from each other now, and then there’s an emotional aspect that gets layered on top of that.” 
The discussion shifted to analyzing Trump’s State of the Union address as it aired live. 
In the address, Trump focused on nationwide issues such as veteran care, environmental work, medical care, immigration laws, opioid and drug addiction, military funding, nuclear weapons, ISIS and Israel. 
After describing his vision for the next year to resolve these issues, Trump stated that “the most difficult challenges bring out the best in Americans.”
Several attendees agreed that Trump’s address started off well, but that the president eventually reverted back to one-sided campaign rhetoric. 
“I think there were way too many anecdotal experiences [in the address],” said Sahiba Gill, a freshman majoring in neuroscience. “It felt very much like exploiting these people’s stories and using it as propaganda.”
Vavreck said that Trump minimized statements about what defines a “true American” and how to “make America great again,” which she believed contradicted his plan to promote a theme of bipartisanship and unity in his address.
However, to Lina Goggins-Rendon, a freshman majoring in theatre, the address was rather enjoyable to watch, and she plans to attend more events that provide further analysis on politics and current events.
“[In the past year,] I avoided the news a lot, so [the event] was a nice refresher to get the current perspective and reflect on the things that I did know about and was really involved in,” Goggins-Rendon said. 
In a statement, Mayor Eric Garcetti expressed concerns about the “weak and misguided ideas” that were promoted in Trump’s address.
“We heard this Administration’s mistaken priorities — giveaways for the wealthiest corporations; breaking up immigrant families; and nothing real on infrastructure,” Garcetti said in the statement. “My message is loud and clear: Listen to America’s Mayors who run police departments, build infrastructure, and create jobs. We need a Washington that listens to America, not one that threatens and divides.”

The Undergraduate Student Government Senate will vote next week on a resolution that would add a new position to its advocacy branch. The Senate also decided to rename the Director of External Affairs position to Director of Community Affairs, adding a Director of External Affairs position would entail different responsibilities if the resolution is passed. 
Alec Vandenberg, the co-director of the student service assembly, proposed the addition of a new director position in the advocacy branch to promote student interest in external affairs. Daniel Zhu | Daily Trojan
Alec Vandenberg, a co-director of the Student Service Assembly, proposed the resolution at the Senate meeting Tuesday night. He said the new position would help advocate for the undergraduate population off campus, particularly in the political sphere. The new director’s role would include calling for town halls at USC for federal and state congressional candidates.
“We want to make sure that [undergraduate students] have an avenue to express their opinions and make sure that their rights are protected,” Vandenberg said.
He cited precedent for the proposed role, noting that the Graduate Student Government as well as undergraduate student governments at many other top universities like UCLA, UC Berkeley, Georgetown University and the University of Chicago all have this position. Vandenberg said USC is currently only serving its students’ on-campus needs, and that off-campus policies that affect students’ rights are also important for USG to consider. 
“I see a lack of organization of making sure that we have a mouthpiece to connect people to outside voices and external actors,” Vandenberg said. “[Both] on- and off-campus policies affect students’ rights.”
However, several senators including Preston Fregia, Buck Andrews, Debbie Lee, Tyler Matheson, Isabella Smith and Noah Silver expressed concerns. 
Andrews questioned whether this new position would politicize USG elections, noting that elected officials would influence which policy preferences would be supported by USG. He suggested that a check be placed on the potential director to ensure that policies are kept non-partisan.
Fregia expressed concerns regarding the influence of this new position on the USG budget, asking if this position would be paid. Vandenberg, while noting that the cost of the new director’s activities would be minimal, said the position would be paid.
Lee asked whether the new director would represent the true will of the undergraduate population or merely the views of more outspoken individuals. Vandenberg responded that polling would be conducted in order to fairly gauge the desires of undergraduate populations. 
Among the senators questioning Vandenberg’s proposal, Matheson was the most vocal, stressing the potential entrance of ideological politics and party affiliations into USG as a result of the position
“I don’t see how, if this becomes a reality, senators can not bring their political ideologies into USG,” Matheson said. “I can’t see a possibility where I wouldn’t identify as a Democrat or Republican in order to help me win.”
Matheson also noted the existence of political groups on campus, saying that they could serve this purpose better. He expressed fear regarding the politicization of USG if this new position is implemented.
“You can see why that’s a slippery slope because then all of the sudden, you have the USG office filled with party politics, as opposed to actually serving the students,” Matheson said.
Vandenberg attempted to ease the senators’ concerns, emphasizing that the new position would focus on specific issues rather than broader ideological commitments.
“It’s making sure that government is accessible to students, not dictating that government should influence them or how we should influence them to engage with the government,” Vandenberg said. “There is going to be an emphasis on making sure that this is issue focused. It’s not about partisan politics.”
The senate also voted 11-1 in favor of sending Cindy Pineda, a USG co-chief diversity officer to a first-generation and low-income students conference taking place from Feb. 16 to 18 at the University of Pennsylvania. Senator Natalie Antounian cast the dissenting vote.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Leslie A. Swain ruled Tuesday that former graduate student David Jonathan Brown was not guilty by reason of insanity for the first-degree murder of USC professor Bosco Tjan, according to the L.A. County District Attorney’s office.
The ruling was made after reviewing evaluation reports from two psychiatrists, including Risa Grand, a forensic psychiatrist who works with the L.A. County Superior Court and is a clinical assistant professor at the Keck School of Medicine and closely examined Brown’s mental state. 
“It’s highly unusual for this plea to even be taken into consideration, less than one percent,” Grand said. “It’s very rare.”
Grand said she could not comment on the specifics of the case.
Steve Schoenfield, Brown’s public defender, said that Brown will now receive treatment for his mental illness.
“My heart goes out to the family and loved ones of Mr. Tjan,” Schoenfield said. “David will be sent to a hospital where he will receive the psychiatric care and treatment that he desperately needs.”
Brown had been charged with first-degree murder in the fatal stabbing of Tjan at Seeley G. Mudd, with a special allegation of using a “deadly and dangerous weapon” to kill Tjan, according to Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman.
Tjan had worked at the University since 2001, was considered an expert in vision research and served as the co-director of the Dornsife Cognitive Neuroimaging Center. 
Police said that the murder was motivated by a “personal dispute.” 
Brown, who was studying neuroscience, had previously taken a leave of absence from working in Tjan’s lab at USC for “personal reasons” two years ago, according to the New York Daily News.
Brown could have faced between 25 years to life in prison if convicted for the first-degree murder charge.
Brown was arrested in December 2016, and has remained in custody since then. Last May, Brown pleaded not guilty to charges of use of a deadly weapon, as well as not guilty by reason of insanity for the murder. 
Brown will return to court on March 6 for a placement hearing, where a judge will decide if he is sent to a state mental hospital, according to the District Attorney’s office.

By the fourth week of classes, students are more familiar with their professors, and know more about their teaching style, rigor and, in many cases, political views. While understanding their professors can help some students navigate their classes, it can also deter others.
Some believe classroom settings should remain politics-free. And yet, keeping classes this way would not only be ineffective, but would also hinder class discussions. While professors do not need to explicitly state their political views, discussions of current events and political issues will typically take place anyway. Even non-humanities professors can be eager to share their political views, perhaps in a discussion during office hours.
Talking politics with professors has several benefits: It can expose students to new viewpoints, encourage students to open their minds and even question their own views.
While a professor’s political affiliation is not something to fear, their political bias is. Of course, not every professor is politically biased against those who disagree with his or her points of view — to say so would be absurd. But to say that none are is equally wrong.

According to a 2016 Washington Times study, liberal professors outnumber conservative ones at 40 of the nation’s most prestigious universities by a 12:1 ratio. Of five departments the study analyzed, economics was the friendliest field to conservative students with the liberal-conservative professor ratio at 4.5:1. In contrast, liberal history professors outnumber conservatives by a 34:1 ratio. 
Of course, the numbers expose the overwhelming liberal majority and lack of political diversity at elite universities. This is a problem independent of the political bias question. After all, even if the liberal to conservative ratio were 1:1, it would not eliminate skewed opinions about students of opposing viewpoints. 
There is little to no data on political bias because many of its impacts cannot be recorded concretely. Since bias is subconscious, it is hard to show the observable implications with numbered data. Indeed, grades may be the exception, but political bias generates discomfort among students with different opinions, who may be reluctant to participate in discussions or unwilling to attend office hours. 
Do we want to have meaningful political debates and conversations in class? Of course. But there are two prongs that must be achieved for such conversations to take place. First, professors must share their political views. Second, students must be willing to share their own views as well. 
While igniting political conversations can start class discussions, not all students will chime in. Typically, only students who share the same viewpoint as the professor speak up.
But should students who fundamentally disagree with the professor be expected to voice their opinions? Idealists would say yes. Realists know this usually isn’t the case. 
Students with opinions that differ from the majority’s may be deterred from sharing their point of view. And it’s hard to blame them. They have far more to lose — the respect of their peers in some cases, the judgment of their professors and maybe even their grades. 
Let’s face it — all professors and students have political opinions; nobody is politically neutral. And professors should be free to share their views. However, they should not expect outward disagreement and intellectual debate to ignite automatically. Instead, professors ought to make clear that they welcome disagreement. If they truly want their classrooms to be considered  civil places for debate, they must facilitate the conversation neutrally and keep their grading separate and objective.
