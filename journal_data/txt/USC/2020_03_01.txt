An old-fashioned, homey dining room and traditional American menu have attracted generations of students to grab a seat at the counter of the Grinder restaurant near campus. 
On Sunday, the diner — that has served the area for 48 years and is the last remaining location of the Grinder chain — will close its doors.
Assistant manager Carlos Rodas said the land from Figueroa Street to Flower Street north of West 28th Street, including the Grinder and Taco Bell properties, was sold to a developer, but that he did not know the new owner or the future of the property. Employees received two weeks’ notice of the diner’s closing on Feb. 16. 
“We don’t own the land, so the land was sold,” Rodas said. “Whoever bought the land wants us out since they want to develop the land.”
Rodas, who has been working at Grinder for 29 years, said many customers who first visited as USC students years ago now bring their kids. He added that what he’ll miss most about his time at Grinder is the relationships he has built with the customers. 
“People have come here [to] celebrate birthdays, celebrate graduation [and] celebrate the life achievements,” Rodas said. “A lot of generations of USC students have come through here.”
For many long-time customers living nearby, Grinder’s closing means they will lose the only sit-down, full-service restaurant within walking distance, as fast food restaurants such as McDonald’s and Panda Express populate most of Figueroa Street, Rodas said.
“We’re not like fast food restaurants. You can actually sit down, be served,” Rodas said. “From what I hear, [customers are] all saying, ‘Where are we going to eat now?’ because around here there’s no other restaurant like this.”
Pat Diaz, a long-time customer at Grinder who lives nearby, said she loves the diner for its reasonable prices and proximity to her home since she is unable to drive. She recounted how Grinder had survived for decades and benefited the community.
“I recall this street, Figueroa, was just an automobile row, just cars, empty parking spaces,” Diaz said. “When the Olympics came, they got spruced up, but the Grinder was here earlier than that, 10 years earlier. For us, people who don’t drive, it was a step up for us, so finally we [had] a fancy restaurant.”
Diaz, who dines at Grinder once a week, said she enjoys meeting friends in the cozy diner where she has gotten to know many employees over the years.
“The service staff is very patient and kind,” Diaz said. “It’s almost like family … You don’t feel like you’re being rushed or in a hurry. That’s what I enjoy about [Grinder].”
Danny Bravo, another resident living in the neighborhood, has been coming to the diner on weekends with his family since he was a kid.
“It felt more home-like, and the service is very good,” Bravo said. “After a few times of coming, the servers generally know you, and they treat you like part of the family.”
Grinder is popular among USC students because of its proximity to the campus and the 20% discount for USC students. Grinder serves a full menu of breakfast, lunch and dinner all day in order to provide more options for customers. 
“We try to give the best services we possibly can,” Rodas said. “I think we did well while we were here, but what happened was beyond our control.”
Grinder’s closing will mean that workers will soon find themselves unemployed. Grinder has many long-time employees who treat the restaurant not only as their job but also as a family, Rodas said. 
“It’s frustrating because [Grinder’s closing] is not because of what we do here or performance — it is something beyond our control,” Rodas said. “We have to basically get out and go find another job.”
Waitress Mercedes Ortiz has been working at Grinder for 32 years and was devastated to hear about its closing because she has a sentimental attachment to the place. 
“I love the Grinder, this is like my second house, being here all day, every day,” Ortiz said. “I was young when I started working here … I was sad to hear that the owner is going to close the restaurant.”
Taylor Martin, a sophomore majoring in international relations and global business, said dining at Grinder reminds him of his parents cooking up pancakes at home, since the service makes him comfortable and relaxed.
“It reminds me of a lot of the places that I grew up going to by the beach with my dad, it’s got that very homey feel,” Martin said. “I went with a bunch of my friends, so I associate going there with the memories I share with them.”
Rodas said even though Grinder was closing and the employees were losing their jobs, they were optimistic that things would get better.  
“One door closes, one door opens, so something positive has to come to us,” Rodas said. “Right now it’s maybe because our judgment is a little cloudy and our vision is cloudy, but that clears up as time moves on.”

In my small Pennsylvania town, I, like many other Americans, was raised to never talk about religion, money or politics. But while zooming around some backroads after a brunch at my local diner over winter break, one of my friends asked which presidential candidate each of us would support in the upcoming election. 
I silently navigated the car and braced for a screaming match, but to my surprise, everyone came to a consensus in a matter of minutes. Almost all of them wanted to support Sen. Elizabeth Warren — they just didn’t believe their neighbors and other voters would feel the same. Instead, they resolved to vote for whichever candidate seemed closest to clinching the nomination once our state primary came about.  
Like many American voters, my friends considered Warren’s electability as a female candidate over their views on her policies and principles. 
When I pointed out that focusing so heavily on electability seemed to push out candidates from underrepresented groups in politics, like Warren, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Sen. Kamala Harris, Sen. Cory Booker and Andrew Yang, they insisted that it felt most important to pick a candidate who could defeat Donald Trump come 2020. If Hillary Clinton didn’t do the job in 2016, how were they to believe a different woman or person of color could draw enough support come election day in 2020?
And teens in Pennsylvania aren’t the only voters who pay attention to a candidate’s likeability and electability. A June Ipsos/Daily Beast poll found that just one-third of Democrats and Independents thought their neighbors would be comfortable with a female president, and pollsters and media outlets such as the New York Times have focused survey questions and coverage around a candidate’s chances against Trump. 
Kelly Dittmar, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics, said when discussing electability, media outlets and voters should focus on statistics that show women winning elections at the same rate as men rather than subjective and often sexist factors, like a candidate’s likability. Because voters focus so heavily on a candidate’s potential success, Dittmar said female candidates and people of color running at all levels often end up managing “dual campaigns:” a traditional one to prove they’re the best candidate out of the pack and another to show that they’re able to beat the white men running against them. 
“Imagine if all of the time that Elizabeth Warren has been on stage and in interviews responding to the question about whether or not she’s electable, imagine if she could instead be talking about public policy issues she wants to be talking about,” Dittmar said. “Or instead of convincing potential donors that she’s electable, she could be making 10 more donor calls.”
Even in 2016, when many Democrats believed Clinton had a clear path to victory over Trump because of his hateful rhetoric and lack of experience, my mom and friends had told me they didn’t think voters were “ready” to elect their first female president right after the country’s first Black president finished his second term.  
In each of these elections, voters have justified the electability question with varying circumstances, yet each time it serves the same purpose: telling women and people of color they must continue to wait for their turn to hold office. But that waiting period often feels like it has no end time. 
In order to push more voters to see underrepresented candidates as electable, Linda Zerilli, a University of Chicago professor studying gender and politics, said political hopefuls should explain the policy inequities that still exist for women and people of color. She said she thinks issues such as poverty that more so affect women and people of color need to be brought to the forefront of debates and mainstream media coverage, so that all voters see current political actions haven’t done enough to push equity reforms. 
Dittmar often reminds her students at Rutgers University at Camden to check their opinions to ensure they’re being as harsh on white male candidates’ platforms, stances and behaviors as they are on women and people of color running for office. 
She also thinks female candidates should avoid conforming to male stereotypes that are thought to convey leadership in their campaign messages. Rather than advertising themselves as tough and focused on issues like national security that are traditionally viewed as masculine, Dittmar believes female candidates can change the narrative by discussing other values voters should consider in potential leaders that don’t necessarily align with traditionally masculine traits. 
The 2018 midterm election, which saw more female candidates elected than ever before, proved a sign of hope that more voters turned out to support women. In order to keep that momentum and ensure that our elected officials look more representative of the country they’re leading, voters need to pick the candidate they support when they head to the polls rather than the one they believe their neighbors could get behind. 
And when anyone tries to bring up the question of electability or says a woman or person of color can’t win this time for whatever reason, voters should remember to defend their policies and stances as they would with any white man running for the same position.

Many students know the feeling: walking around Trader Joe’s and looking for a quick dinner, famished because the need to get a few extra minutes of sleep before a 9 a.m. class outweighs a proper breakfast that morning. There are plenty of options less than $3-4, but they all lack nutritional value, seasoning and excitement. At this point, this trip can follow one of two paths: settling for a disappointing snack or spending $6 on something actually enjoyable, like tzatziki or wine cheese. But inevitably, students beat themselves up for splurging. And for those who didn’t know, a mere $2 difference in food pricing is enough to make some students — even at USC — stressed. 
A big part of being a university student is learning how to budget and manage your money — whether it be an allowance from your parents or a direct deposit from your work-study job. But with tuition, loans, housing, food, textbooks and a bunch of miscellaneous costs that weren’t accounted for, the process of budgeting and cutting down on spending becomes emotionally laborious and draining. 
As students come to terms with this harsh reality, even if it is something they dealt with prior to attending a higher education institution, they may often begin policing themselves in stringent and unhealthy ways. Buying basic snacks or a pack of highlighters can feel like a massive splurge, provoking feelings of self-hatred and shame in students when they do spend a few dollars on something later deemed unnecessary.
It doesn’t help that open discussions about money are generally taboo in courteous settings. Especially at private institutions, there is an inherent stigma placed around poverty and talking about financial issues. Additionally, there are very few outlets or spaces to vent about these overwhelming stressors. 
At a campus where you constantly see people walking around in $500 Golden Goose sneakers and wearing designer bags, how is one supposed to feel comfortable with talking about how you only have a few dollars left in your bank account and how payday gives you the same amount of serotonin as Christmas used to? 
While there are mental health services available at USC, those who choose to opt out of the student health insurance plan due to its price, or because they have their own health care plan (although it’s most likely out of reach from campus) aren’t afforded the same counseling opportunities. This means that lower-income students, who often experience high burdens and need a safe space, void of judgment, to talk about their financial stresses are left with nowhere to turn. 
The often addictive feeling of happiness when saving money and the opposing shame when making a seemingly “unnecessary” purchase is a dangerous pattern that students can fall into while attending university that they may carry into adulthood. It is in this transitional time of a young person’s life that, even if the odds are stacked against them, they can learn to treat themselves with kindness and dignity. 
Although this hot take isn’t coming from an expert by any means, it’s important to note that occasionally spending money on yourself beyond necessities — even if that means planning it out or physically setting a few dollars to the side — can be incredibly relieving. According to Inc. an American business magazine, while budgeting and the reduction of impulse buying can be healthy, there is some danger in being unnecessarily frugal because of the anxiety and restriction it causes in individuals. 
Although most people beneath a certain tax bracket aren’t taught this, a form of self-care can sometimes be to unapologetically get yourself a gift. Whether it’s your favorite dessert, a new book or a ticket to see a movie in theaters (and yes, maybe even with an order of popcorn), understanding that budgeting doesn’t need to equate to financially abusing yourself is an integral part of establishing self-worth and happiness.

Singer-songwriter Lady Gaga, an 11-time Grammy winner best known for her eclectic fashion sense, born-this-way-bold persona and pop dance tracks, announced in late February the release of a new single off of her upcoming sixth studio album, nicknamed LG6. The single, called “Stupid Love,” was released Friday and was accompanied by an extraterrestrial music video that has kept fans talking and captivated by the pop star icon. 
As one of the biggest pop stars on an international level, the song features a classic Lady Gaga pop music sound with electronic dance and synth beats mimicking her “Born this Way” and “The Fame Monster” eras. With such a disco-reminiscent sound, it is unlike anything that could’ve been predicted from her recent years coming off of her first feature film and motion picture soundtrack in “A Star is Born.” After four years of waiting for another studio album release, we are finally getting a hint at the beginning of the next Gaga eras with “Stupid Love.”
The opening of the track has a range of electronic beats playing in disjointed vocal waves of succession to a deeper sounding, hard-hitting, upbeat pace. Electro-pop drums and the ’80s synth feel are woven into the lyrical melody, increasing the track’s intensity and euphoria. The chorus is certainly going to be stuck in your mind after listening to it. “Stupid Love’s” sound can be credited to BloodPop, a music producer Gaga has worked closely with for several years and on her last studio album, “Joanne.” 
Along with the release of the song came an ethereal music video that was shot entirely on the iPhone 11 Pro. Crossing punk and glamour, Lady Gaga teased the music video hours before it dropped, giving followers an otherworldly look into the eye-catching music video before the full release. The clips had a slow, cinematic, background instrumental that featured a barrage of string instruments as if to transport viewers into another universe. It’s as if Gaga is creating her own mythology. 
In one video she posted to Instagram, Gaga is seen mouthing and using sign language to say, “All I ever wanted was love.” As she crosses her arms in the sign for love, wearing hot pink fishnet gloves on her wrists, her colorful army of dancers follows suit. When the video begins, a title card opens reading “The world rots in conflict. Many tribes battle for dominance. While the Spiritual ones pray and sleep for peace, the Kindness punks fight for Chromatica.”  
The video takes place in a dusty desert scene with massive rock structures brought to life by the wardrobe, colors and hard-hitting dance routines. Gaga performs her dance routines wearing a variety of skintight pink metallic bodysuits, bubblegum pink bras, silver chains, bows and dramatic makeup looks that feature chrome and metallic accents and, of course, the thematic color throughout the video: hot pink.
The fantasy-like visuals in the music video tell a story of a divided world parallel to the universe we’re living in. Lady Gaga has never been shy about making statements and sharing her political concerns on issues she stands by, and this video is no exception. 
It offers up the idea that the solution to mending this detached world is to love. It encourages people to embrace themselves for who they truly are and to try to love themselves — flaws and all. But, at last, this idea that all people must live harmoniously and in unity isn’t always on the horizon as much as Gaga tries to portray it as such in the music video. She tweeted right after the video was up “earth is cancelled.” Not only does this allude to the post-apocalyptic planet Lady Gaga and her team created in the music video, but it also could be hinting at what fans can expect to see in this new era. 
It is exciting to see Lady Gaga return to the catchy, disco-reminiscent dance songs that launched her major-label career. She seems to be stepping away from the role she played in “A Star is Born” and the songs she delivered within that soundtrack to come back to a more pop-influenced persona and sound. 
On her billboard art and promotions, fans have noticed the word “Chromatica” appearing frequently. Since Gaga has not made any public statements about the title of the album or its release date, and has yet to address what “Chromatica” is, I would not be surprised if we find out that the album’s title has been right in front of our eyes the whole time. 
Overall, this comeback release seems to be about harmony, unity, love and kindness, all while battling to see one’s own worth. Continuing to be a captivating pop star at the top of her game, Lady Gaga is back, LG6 is coming and fans are ready.

Try for a moment to think back to your 11th grade English class. With a little more effort, think of what you actually learned in that class. Doubtless, you read “The Great Gatsby” and learned that Nick Carraway is something called an “unreliable narrator.” We get the facts of Jay Gatsby’s life solely through Carraway’s narration; he sounds like an aged man recounting times past, and we can’t help but wonder if he’s embellishing or covering things up. Even in my upper-division English classes, the novel is the prototypical text on narration. 
Narration is a fascinating issue in literature and film. F. Scott Fitzgerald speaking through Carraway is like Martin Scorsese speaking through Henry Hill in “Goodfellas.” In such cases, the author really wants his readers to see the story from only this perspective. In novels, the words are supposed to be “written” by the fictional narrator, but in film every aesthetic choice ought to be subservient to the story’s perspective. 
In “Goodfellas,” Ray Liotta’s Henry Hill narrates his life as a gangster, and we see his perspective reflected in the way the movie is shot, edited and soundtracked. Scorsese is pretty blatant about it too: Early on, as Hill lists his fellow gangsters, the camera glides through a restaurant and each face greets it when his name is called. They’re not greeting the audience — they’re greeting Hill. But, doesn’t it feel like they’re greeting us? We feel like insiders, excited to have access to this lavish gangster joint. Maybe Hill felt like that in the moment too.
It is in this context that Scorsese deploys his famous Copacabana long take, or “Oner.” Hill and his girlfriend Karen (Lorraine Bracco) enter the famous club through the basement, across the rowdy kitchen and up to the packed main room. The whole thing is a single uncut shot, and it’s the stuff film buffs drool over. 
I don’t mean that as a bad thing. But, the whole point of this longwinded background on perspective is because I want to talk about how the “Oner” has lost its significance as a tool to establish a movie’s point of view. Now it’s seen as little more than a way for a director to puff his chest. In the best movies, however, every narrative and aesthetic decision can be traced back to perspective.
“Apocalypse Now,” for example, is told through the perspective of Martin Sheen’s character, Captain Willard. You don’t need to watch much of the film to gather that Willard’s narration is married to the visual style of the whole movie. The film opens with a psychedelic montage of Willard getting drunk in his room with images of Vietnam explosions cutting into the action and superimposed on his face, all set to The Doors. Willard is not just telling us his story — we’re in his head. 
Movies that explicitly use a single point of view don’t always need narration to show it. In “Meek’s Cutoff,” director Kelly Reichardt presents the story in a tight, square-aspect ratio because we are meant to see things from the restricted perspective of the female characters — their view is limited because they’re wearing bonnets. Stroke of genius. 
Take a recent example: I recall seeing a tweet that lamented the success of “1917” because it meant every film student would try to shoot projects in a single take. I liked “1917,” but, at least in my opinion, its technical wonder overshadowed its gruesome story. The film became more about “How did the filmmakers do that?” than “How did the soldiers get through that?” If a movie is meant to make the audience empathize with the characters, putting technical achievement at the forefront detracts from this original purpose.  
The single take — and, really, any other aesthetic decision — should be made for a reason that supports the perspective of the film and adds to its themes. Viewed from this angle, “1917” had good intentions — to make us feel like we’re in this neverending wasteland with these men. It’s our reaction to it that wrongly emphasizes the marvel of its cinematography over any of its dialogue or characters. I say this because I did it, and the only reason any of my friends want to see “1917” is to see camera tricks, not story. 
If any film students are reading this, take it with a grain of salt. I’m not a film student, but I like to think I speak from a place of equal passion as you — I drool over single takes myself, but I want to think about them the right way now. 
Thinking about aesthetics does not detract from how you can express a story in film; I believe it makes a film more engaging because every part of it is geared to one goal, one vision for how the story ought to be told. If every stylistic and narrative choice in your movie is directly tied to the perspective, feelings, characters and themes of your story, I believe you’ve made a better movie than if it had one scene without any edits.

Dozens of people gathered around a tall left-leaning tree under the domed roof of Skylight Books, a Los Feliz bookstore that often hosts various authors and artists in its intimate setting. On the evening of Feb. 29, Skylight invited three women to read their poems in front of an engaged and diverse audience just as the sun began to set. Some listeners were sitting in chairs, some were standing in groups and some lingered behind book stacks. All held their breaths in rapture as the poets poured their hearts out into their pieces.
The main visiting author, Megan Fernandes, came to read from her latest poetry book “Good Boys,” which deals with topics such as feminism, race, origin, nuclear proliferation, sexuality and “what it means to exist as a body of contractions.” She was accompanied by two other poets who read before her. 
The first poet, Catherine Pond, is a Ph.D. candidate in literature and creative writing at USC whose debut collection, “Fieldglass,” won the Crab Orchard First Book Award in Poetry in 2019. Pond read three poems from her forthcoming manuscript: “Winter Sister,” “University of Iowa Museum of Natural History” and “Blue Angels Air Show.” In the poems, she addresses metaphorical figures of her friend and boyfriend over themes such as grief, depression and the passage of time. 
“For me, I think my positioning in the poems is more the witness to somebody else’s grief — [when] someone that you love is suffering and not being able to do anything about it,” Pond said.
She spoke of this inability to make the ones you love happy in “Winter Sister,” a poem about a friend losing her brother. 
“Somewhere what you love is still alive / turning cartwheels in a gentle snow / is the kind of lie I write years later / wishing I could make it true for you,” she read. 
Pond’s voice was soothingly monotone and steady as she read, an intonation free of emphasis that deftly drove the listener to pay close attention to every word and phrase uttered.
After Pond came Callie Siskel, a doctoral fellow in creative writing and literature at USC and the author of the poetry book “Arctic Revival” released in 2015, and she read three of her pieces as well.
“I’m so happy to be at USC with [Pond], if you caught that repetition in the bios,” Siskel said proudly, adding that she wrote her third poem of the night in a workshop with Pond.
Siskel’s lilting intonation had less uniformity than Pond’s, but not to her detriment. She still spoke with flow but placed more emphasis on individual words as she read, creating almost a spoken enjambment in which the words took on their own individual meanings. Her three poems, “Messenger,” “Vanitas” and “Ab Initio,” also dealt with grief, childhood and the pasage of time, among other themes, with many of them ruminating on what it is like to lose a father. 
“‘In a past life’ is not supposed to mean your life before tragedy, but an existence altogether unrecognizable, which is maybe the same thing,” Siskel proclaimed in “Ab Initio,” as she reflected on how grief shapes one’s life and identity. “No one would know me in a past life. The allure is not who we were, but who we are not.”
After ending her portion of the event on that powerful note, Fernandes finally stepped up to the microphone to read five of her “Good Boys” pieces. 
Fernandes went off on passionate, crescendoing tangents only to suddenly slow down, leaving the audience reeling and hanging on to her every word. Her anger, humor, anguish and sometimes confusion clearly shone through her voice; at one point she joked about her poems, saying “they’re all bummers.” Fernandes also gave lively backstories for her poems, and many directly reference people from her life, which invited the audience further into her personal narrative. 
Her first poem, “Running in the Suburbs,” offers commentary on growing up as a girl of color becoming aware of her race. “Nukemap.com” addresses the anxiety of living in New York under the threat of nuclear war, while “Conversion” paints a portrait of gay adolescence and conversion therapy. 
“In my poems, I write a lot about sexuality, and struggles or thoughts I’ve had about it,” Fernandes said. “But it’s not necessarily an argument that I’m making … It’s more like this is really messy. And I’ve always felt really messy about it, and I probably will for the rest of my life.”
“Why We Drink” details Fernandes’ friendship with a man named Malik and the confusing process of aging, while her last poem, “Amsterdam,” ties together a conglomeration of issues, from the widespread voyeurism of Anne Frank’s life to her feelings of disconnect from the United States despite living there. 
“I say, humiliation is like the nausea of childhood with / those delayed epiphanies. I hate the violence of insight / the lesson is always how one is ugly or dishonest, / the short-comings that could build a civilization and then did,” Fernandes read passionately in “Why We Drink,” pausing for a breath afterward to let the words sink in. Her combination of flow and pauses was reminiscent of both Pond and Siskel’s intonations.
Pond’s mother, Marjorie Pond, pointed out the interesting ways in which all three of the poets’ different voices interplayed with each other during the event.
“Each woman poet comes from her experiences of the world and feminism from a different perspective,” Marjorie Pond reflected at the end of the reading. “[Siskel’s voice] was kind of a combination of [Fernandes’] fire and [Pond’s] more soft voice. That was interesting.”
This was a welcomed blend, though, as each author complemented the other, creating a dynamic reading full of introspection, tender realizations and beautiful lyricism.

A lawsuit against USC alleging abuse of laboratory animals will be permitted to proceed, a judge ruled in district court Friday. 
The lawsuit, filed in June by anti-animal-experimentation activist group Stop Animal Exploitation NOW!, accused the University of mistreating animals, including rats and mice, in its research labs. It named 50 individual defendants, all listed under the pseudonym “Doe,” in addition to USC.
In the complaint, the activist group alleged the University researchers in animal labs performed surgeries without proper approval and without administering appropriate painkillers, kept animal subjects in overcrowded conditions, disposed of live animals in freezers intended for storage of remains and did not euthanize animals suffering from painful tumors promptly.
“These practices find no refuge under the guise of research, nor does the banner of science provide a free pass for all manner of abuse,” the group wrote in the complaint. 
The group claimed a whistleblower from within USC reported the abuses enumerated in the complaint, which also accused the University of violating state laws that prohibit unfair business practice and deceptive advertising. Stop Animal Exploitation NOW! alleged the researchers’ abusive treatment of their lab animals gave them an unfair advantage in their fields and that the University’s claim of upholding ethical standards in its research misrepresented its practices, resulting in false impressions of quality and prestige.
The University has maintained that its research practices align with established research protocol. It also stated that the activist group lacked the authority to file the lawsuit, as the accusations made in the suit would not have caused any injury to the group, which is a requirement to sue. The group said the cost of the investigation it launched into USC’s treatment of lab animals qualified as an injury.
“USC denies the plaintiff’s allegations concerning animal mistreatment,” the University wrote in a statement. “The university is highly committed to the ethical and humane treatment of animals in research, and meets or exceeds all accrediting and regulatory standards.”
The University’s defense filed an objection in December contesting the accusations and stating that the claims had no factual backing. In the document, it requested the lawsuit be dismissed, citing a lack of substantial evidence.
“It is apparent from Plaintiff’s repeated inability to plead facts sufficient to establish an injury in fact caused by USC that the [unfair competition law violation] claim here is based on a manufactured injury,” the defense stated.
Stop Animal Exploitation NOW! has filed similar complaints against other universities, including Harvard Medical School, the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Utah, for the alleged abuse of animals in the schools’ research labs.

Following amplified concern over the threat of coronavirus, USC has canceled several spring study abroad programs and University-sponsored spring break trips to areas of Europe and Asia. 
The University made the announcement in a campus-wide email Friday, acknowledging the new information released from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicating that community spread of coronavirus will most likely occur in the United States. A case in Solano County, Calif. was confirmed Thursday with no clear indication of the origin of the contraction. However, the University said California’s risk remains low. As a result, campus-wide activities will continue as usual.
“With the exception of selected international travel, we are continuing all our normal activities, including in-person classes and events,” the email read. “Our focus is on campus-wide preparedness. We are closely following the conditions internationally where our students and employees are studying and working and, when necessary, assisting those individuals to return to campus and/or the [United] States.”
Schools including the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the Marshall School of Business and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences have canceled several international programs to limit travel and ensure student safety. 
Nearly all spring break study abroad programs, including those to countries that have a limited number of cases such as Mexico, have been canceled, with a few exceptions. USC did not indicate which programs would not be affected.
Study abroad trips in South Korea and Italy were also canceled last week once the travel advisory level reached Level III. A Level IV “do not travel” advisory has been issued for the Lombardy and Veneto regions in Italy, with more than 1,000 cases reported in the country, according to the World Health Organization. South Korea — which has more than 3,700 cases of the virus according to the WHO — has also issued a Level III travel advisory.  Programs in China were canceled in early February. The country faces nearly 80,000 cases. 
Some semester-long programs, such as those in Spain and the Netherlands, have not been canceled. USC has not indicated whether these programs will be affected in the following months. Spain has around 45 confirmed cases while the Netherlands has seven.
USC said it is canceling the spring break programs involving international travel due to the evolving nature of the coronavirus epidemic, which has led to flight cancellations, quarantines and border closures in affected countries.
The University plans to support international students who are unable to return home by keeping dining halls and student housing open during spring break, according to the University statement. Typically, student housing and dining halls operate with modified hours over spring break, but the University has not indicated whether these hours will be extended to accommodate students who cannot return home. 
“We have numerous support systems in place for international students who are unable to return home during spring break due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions or general travel concerns,” the statement read. 
On Thursday, Marshall canceled all of its international trips through May, citing the rapid spread of the coronavirus in several regions worldwide. Several students from the World Bachelor in Business have returned home. 
“After having already cancelled many trips, and rearranging or rescheduling others, we have decided that it is best to curtail the ongoing uncertainties and potential disruptions associated with the international trips this semester,” the email read. 
However, the four-year-long program, in which students register at partnered universities in Hong Kong and Milan, has not been canceled because the students are also enrolled at those institutions.
Grace Yu, a junior majoring in business administration who was studying in Milan with Marshall’s WBB program, said in-person class meetings in Milan were suspended Feb. 23, but some professors elected to shift to an online format. Yu traveled back to the United States this weekend after learning the number of reported coronavirus cases had increased by 50% in Italy as of that weekend.
“After that notification, a lot of people booked flights for the next day and immediately went home,” Yu said. “A lot of the fear is ‘I don’t want to be stuck in Italy, I don’t want the city to shut down and not be able to leave’ … I think the scariest thing right now is we don’t know how long this is going to be.”
Yu, who paid out of pocket for her flight, said that WBB students did not receive updates from University officials or the program on whether classes will resume. 
“Our counselors are really hopeful that classes will resume as scheduled in maybe two or three weeks, but they don’t know what’s going to happen if our midterms … or our final exam will be delayed,” Yu said. “Nothing is guaranteed, and everything is contingent upon the development of this virus.”
USC did not comment on how the University plans to handle financial and academic logistics for students required to return to the United States.
Sean O’Connell, the Marshall undergraduate international program manager, said that although he anticipates mixed reactions to the cancellation of spring break programs like the International Experiential Corporate Learning Program in South Korea, student safety remains a top priority. 
“We understand that they’re going to be disappointed, we understand maybe some of them will be angry with us,” O’Connell said. “But I’d rather live with that than live with the fact that we may be bringing students into an area that could change overnight, and then suddenly they’re stuck there.” 
Annenberg students received an email Friday night announcing the cancellation of spring break immersion trips. Annie Nguyen, who planned to travel through the program to Mexico City, said she was frustrated to learn the program was canceled two weeks before they were set to leave without any prior indication of the possibility that that would happen. 
“I think it would have been beneficial for the University to [update students] as they were making decisions,” said Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in journalism. “They’ve been pretty on top of not worrying on coronavirus, but I think I would have appreciated [an update] of ‘We might cancel your program’ just to put that out there before ‘Hey, it’s canceled.’”
Cameron Keel, a junior majoring in communication who is studying abroad in Rome, said she doesn’t believe the situation abroad is severe enough to warrant canceling study abroad programs and has considered staying in Europe through her own financial means even if the University decides to cancel the program. 
“There have been talks in our program if [USC] cancels it that we’re just going to get an Airbnb here and stay because the threat is really no greater here than anywhere else in the world,” Keel said. “Besides the issue of the grocery stores running out of food from panic — that’s really the only issue that we see.”
Yu said she and other students have been confused by reports from media outlets about coronavirus because news sources have been approaching its severity in varying degrees. She’s also noticed that locals and tourists in Milan have been reacting to the situation paradoxically. 
“If you look outside, people are walking or having fun, but then at the same time, a lot of people are also staying inside and taking precautions — going to the grocery store and stocking up on stuff,” Yu said. “We’re being fed with so many different conflicting news sources … It’s just really hard for us to even judge how we should feel about this whole situation.”
Yu also said the only communication that WBB students have received is University-wide emails from the provost updating the general student body and that she is frustrated by the lack of information provided to the students in affected areas. 
“It would have been helpful if [USC] has been updating us specifically, since we are in Italy and we are technically also a USC program,” Yu said. “I feel like they should have had more responsibility. [I am] checking the news, but some people might not be, and so I think it’s really important if they do continue to reach out to us and send these important updates.” 
Yu said several of her friends have experienced racism and xenophobic slurs and actions from locals while abroad because of their Asian background.
“One of my friends, he was trying to catch a taxi, and three different people refused service because he was Asian and they thought he was [carrying] the virus,” Yu said. “On the bus [my friends would] hear people next to them saying ‘Cinese, Cinese,’ which means Chinese in Italian, and pointing and covering their mouths. I think it is really important to stay cautious but also … to be educated and not take your judgments so far.” 
The University has expressed concerns about harassment related to the virus occurring abroad and on campus through an email to the Daily Trojan. It has advised students to express their concerns by contacting Trojans Care 4 Trojans and Campus Support and Intervention.
In early February, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, International Student Assembly and Undergraduate Student Government, condemned discrimination against the Asian and Asian American communities on campus in a schoolwide letter. The letter came in response to online xenophobic comments about the coronavirus, which were amplified after false information rapidly spread about a potential case at the Lorenzo Apartments in late January.
“We do not condone any type of discrimination or harassment at USC, and we value every member of the Trojan family,” a University email to the Daily Trojan read. “We are a community that is working together to support each other, identify solutions and provide outstanding care and compassion to all in the midst of this rapidly evolving situation.”
Maria Eberhart, Natalie Oganesyan and Kate Sequeira contributed to this report.

February was a big month for blockbuster sports news. With the Super Bowl, NBA All-Star Game and Houston Astros cheating revelations, you might have missed the most recent development from another unfolding story. 
On Feb. 6, financial adviser Marty Blazer, who acted as an FBI informant and was the catalyst for the 2017 college basketball bribery scandal, avoided jail time but was ordered to pay $1.5 million in restitution while also ordered to forfeit $2.3 million in assets in U.S. District Court. 
The bribery scandal sent shockwaves through the college basketball world, implicating 22 programs in total and resulting in the arrests of assistant coaches from USC, Auburn, Oklahoma State and Alabama. 
Though it is an uncontroversial and positive development that cheaters are being punished, another consequence of the scandal is that federal authorities have voluntarily taken up the mantle of enforcing — and therefore legitimizing — the NCAA’s amateurism rules.
The FBI’s investigation uncovered a complex scheme to pay prospective players that was unprecedented in its scale. It revealed that  the implicated assistant coaches — including USC’s Tony Bland —  received money from a financial adviser and NBA agent in return for recommending their services to players. The FBI also alleged that an Adidas executive collaborated with the coaching staffs of Miami and Louisville to siphon six-figure payments to the families of high schoolers as a means of gaining a recruiting advantage. 
The scandal also cast a shadow over USC’s once-promising 2017-18 basketball season. Ranked 10th in the preseason AP poll, the Trojans were forced to endure the arrest of Bland and the full-season suspension of starting guard De’Anthony Melton due to the bribery revelations, resulting in a disappointing season that ended without an NCAA Tournament berth.
Another distinguishing feature of the 2017 scandal was that the investigation into the scheme and the eventual punishment of those implicated were carried out by federal authorities, marking a shift toward the criminalization of NCAA rules violations. Despite the fact that the NCAA has its own investigation and enforcement processes to uphold its rules, the organization took a hands-off approach to the bribery scandal and let federal authorities take charge.
In order to prosecute NCAA rules violators, federal authorities capitalized on the fact that the universities involved receive federal funds. Prosecutors argued that the violators committed fraud by making the federally funded universities they worked for susceptible to NCAA punishment.
In other words, rather than treating the bribery scandal as the systemic issue it is, federal law enforcement officials prosecuted relatively low-level assistant coaches and intermediaries while employing legal reasoning that casts the major universities implicated as victims because there was a chance the NCAA could have caught them.
Many observers have rightfully questioned the wisdom of the federal government serving as an enforcement mechanism for the NCAA. 
“If you take away NCAA rules, there’s no criminal case here,” George Washington University law professor Randall Eliason told the Washington Post. “There are some legitimate questions about whether this was a wise use of resources.”
Eliason is right. As significant a development the bribery scandal was in the college basketball world, it is absurd that federal authorities expended taxpayer funds, in addition to the FBI’s time and energy, to investigate and prosecute assistant college basketball coaches and intermediaries who could hardly be described as menaces to society.
And perhaps more disturbingly, by prosecuting those involved in the bribery scandal on the basis that they broke NCAA rules, the federal government has given a tacit endorsement to the organization’s outdated and irrational amateurism rules.
Despite the fact that the college basketball bribery scandal seems like a dangerous development because the words “bribery” and “fraud” are frequently used in association with it, there was nothing inherently wrong with the actions that sparked it. 
Much like how companies often recruit high-profile ambassadors or social media influencers, the Adidas executive and the other individuals accused of making bribes identified individuals who would likely be of value to their company and made inroads with those individuals through financial compensation. Only NCAA rules restricting a free market for college athletes’ services made the payments at issue “bribes.” These rules need to be changed.

The 2020 NFL Combine concludes Monday after four days of drills, tests and interviews. The event takes place every year at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, and offers a national platform for NFL prospects to showcase their skills in front of scouts from all 32 NFL teams. 
In past years, USC has been well represented at the combine; at least five Trojans had been invited to attend every year since 2015. That streak ended this year when only two Trojans, wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. and offensive tackle Austin Jackson, were invited. 
However, even though participation was lacking at the combine for USC, talent was not. Both Pittman and Jackson project to be early draft picks and contributors for their future teams. With that in mind, here is how the pair fared at the combine. 
Michael Pittman Jr. 
Pittman entered the combine with modest expectations from analysts and plenty of room to improve his draft prospects. The senior measured in at 6-foot-4, 223 pounds with 32-and-a-half-inch arms and 9-and-a-quarter-inch hands, checking a lot of scouting boxes for size and length, but he needed to show that he was more than just a big bodied, one-dimensional deep-ball threat. 
On day one of the combine, the former Trojan standout did just that. 
Pittman soared above scouts’ expectations with a 4.52-second 40-yard dash. Though not particularly blazing fast for a receiver, his speed score — a metric that factors in a player’s height and weight with their 40 time — ranks Pittman in the 93rd percentile with a score of 111.2. 
Pittman also demonstrated his quickness and agility. In the short-shuttle drill, the wide receiver recorded a 4.14 time, good for second best among his entire position group. His 6.69 second 3-cone drill also made him one of only four wide receivers at the combine to run the drill in under seven seconds. Both times are critical for Pittman considering concerns regarding a lack of elusiveness. 
In another year, Pittman might have projected as a sure-fire second-round pick. Unfortunately for the former Trojan, he just so happens to be entering the draft during one of its deepest years at the receiver position. Still, Pittman made a lot of money for himself in Indianapolis and likely improved what was already a high draft stock with his performance. 
Austin Jackson
Even though Pittman received the bulk of fans’ attention last season — 1,275 yards and 11 touchdowns will do that for a player — it’s actually Jackson who projects to be the highest Trojan selected come draft day. 
According to several mock drafts, Jackson will likely be a late first-round or early second-round selection. Still, the former Trojan demonstrated that he wouldn’t be satisfied by his pre-draft hype and put together an incredibly impressive performance for the scouts in attendance. 
Despite measuring in at 6-foot-4 and 322 pounds, Jackson clocked in an official 40 time of 5.07, good for the ninth best time among offensive linemen. Jackson also recorded a 31-inch vertical and 27 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press, both good for eighth amongst offensive linemen. 
Jackson’s performance in Indianapolis only solidified what was already a very strong case to be one of the top linemen selected on draft day. 
Understandably, USC students, alumni and fans probably hoped to see better Trojan representation at the combine. Still, Pittman and Jackson’s potential at the next level offers plenty to be excited about.

The USC men’s basketball team picked up a huge 71-61 win over Arizona State at Galen Center Saturday. Going into the game, the Sun Devils and Trojans were third and sixth, respectively, in the Pac-12 standings and with the conference tournament approaching, every remaining game can greatly impact the Trojans’ shot at a first-round bye. 
Saturday’s game marked the first “green game” at Galen Center, an initiative by USC to turn the arena into a zero-waste venue. The win moved USC to fifth place with a matchup against UCLA at home this Saturday. 
Senior guard Jonah Mathews led all scorers with 23 points on 58% shooting from the field, while graduate transfer guard Daniel Utomi dropped 19 points on 4-of-8 shooting from behind the 3-point line, along with 10 rebounds. 
“[Utomi]’s definitely the X-factor of the team,” Mathews said. “If he plays well, we’re for sure playing good.”
Head coach Andy Enfield said Utomi and the veterans’ leadership was key to USC’s winning effort.
“The seniors are supposed to help us win a big game on our home court and they did that,” Enfield said. 
Senior forward Nick Rakocevic posted a double-double with 13 points and 11 rebounds, and graduate transfer guard Quinton Adlesh made two big threes down the stretch while playing fantastic defense on the other end of the floor. 
Adlesh played 19 minutes after not seeing significant game action in two of the last three matchups.
“[Adlesh] is a captain for a reason,” Enfield said. “He’s one of the best teammates I’ve ever coached.”
USC fell to the Sun Devils in Tempe 66-64 on Feb. 8 as the squad was unable to score in the last two minutes after going up 64-59, largely due to heavy defensive pressure from Arizona State’s full-court press that forced 18 turnovers in the second half. 
Head coach Bobby Hurley threw that same press on after his team went down 12-2 early thanks to a trio of 3-pointers from Utomi, who would also drain a step-back three to beat the shot clock and put USC up 24-11 with 11 and a half minutes left in the first half.
The press was effective in limiting USC’s offense once again, forcing the Trojans to turn the ball over 14 times in the first half, resulting in 14 points.
ASU cut the score to 26-21 after a floater by junior guard Remy Martin was followed by a steal and a 3-pointer from redshirt senior guard Rob Edwards. 
Martin, a contender for Pac-12 Player of the Year award and who also came off a 30-point game in a loss at UCLA, led ASU in scoring with 22 points.
“It takes a team to guard [Martin],” Enfield said. 
But USC’s shooting steadied its lead all half, going 7-for-11 from downtown as opposed to ASU’s 5-for-14. The Trojans also outrebounded their opponent 21-11, allowing for 10 second-chance points to the Sun Devils’ 2. 
The Trojans were able to settle in during the second half, surrendering just five turnovers.
“Just break the press and run our plays,” Adlesh said of the adjustments at halftime. “Just relax and settle in to our offense.” 
ASU went on an 11-0 scoring run midway through the second half to cut the lead to 54-53 after the Trojans had been in control up 12. 
However, ASU couldn’t keep up with USC the remainder of the game. The Trojans shot 45% from three and 50% from the field, not to mention the 11-rebound advantage they claimed. 
Mathews was finally able to break the nearly five-minute scoring drought with a strong finish and a foul that was followed by a 3-pointer on the next possession with 6:53 to go. 
The win could prove to be huge for a USC team on the bubble for the NCAA Tournament and is looking to improve its seeding in Las Vegas. USC can help out both of those causes when it hosts crosstown rival UCLA at Galen Center Saturday at 12:15 p.m.
