Reports of a shooting at approximately 5:05 p.m. on Monday led the Dept. of Public Safety to send two Trojans Alerts to the USC community.
One alerted students, faculty and staff to an alleged shooting near Exposition Boulevard, while the second claimed that early reports were “unfounded” and the area was safe.
According to DPS Capt. David Carlisle, a DPS officer was on a routine patrol on Exposition Boulevard near Exposition Park when he heard what sounded like a gunshot. He then spoke to a man who thought someone driving by had shot at him, and identified the possible suspects as three Hispanic males in a white Toyota truck with a camper shell.
Carlisle said that the department decided to send out a Trojans Alert immediately to keep students in the loop.
“The suspects are at large. Stay away from the area,” the alert read. “Seek shelter in a secure location until the incident is resolved. Be aware of your surroundings.”
DPS acknowledged that not all information had been confirmed in the alert, but Carlisle said they chose to send the information out anyway to protect students from potential harm.
“At the time, we thought safety of the students first, let’s ensure the safety of the area by sending out a Trojans Alert,” Carlisle said.
After DPS officers began investigating the area, however, they realized no gunshots had been fired and identified the source of the noise as a car backfiring.
The university then sent out a second alert at approximately 5:26 p.m., explaining that the alleged shooting “had been investigated and was determined to be unfounded.”
Despite the inaccuracy of the initial alert, some students said they were pleased with the way DPS handled the reports of the shooting.
“It frustrates me that the incident was, in fact, unfounded, but that being said it didn’t cause me any major inconvenience,” said Matt Cheung, a freshman majoring in communication. “I’m glad that DPS is taking the approach of Trojans being safe rather than sorry.”
Other students, like Brianna Pak, a freshman majoring in industrial systems engineering, however, said they weren’t so happy with the way DPS handled the incident.
“I understand that DPS is trying to be safe as opposed to sorry, but I think they should verify their facts before they talk to students,” she said. “I mean, how do you not know if there was or wasn’t a shooting? It causes unnecessary fear and delegitimizes their alerts in the case of a real emergency.”
Though DPS aims to be both accurate and quick with Trojans Alerts, Carlisle said would rather err on the side of caution.
“The bottom line is a man mistakenly thought a noise was a gunshot, and we sent out a Trojans Alert just to be safe,” Carlisle said.

Though many college students will study foreign countries, cultures and policies in the classroom, few get the opportunity to experience these things firsthand.

From Nov. 11 to 19, Terrence Liu, a junior majoring in biochemistry with a German studies minor, was in Germany as part of the fifth annual Young Technology Leaders delegation, a transatlantic program that selects 12 undergraduate students, graduate students and young professionals to participate in a weeklong conference abroad.
This year, the delegation’s focus was “Healthcare Delivery and Medical Technology,” which Liu said was perfect for him.
“[The delegation] was a good way to get some real world experience about some issues in health care, and exposure to a lot of the important topics in health care including universal coverage and government versus privatized health care,” he said.
Liu was chosen from a pool of applicants who were interested in the field of medical technology and health care. This year, only three other undergraduate students accompanied the older professionals on the trip. Liu was the only attendee from USC.
Liu heard about the program from his German professor, Britta Bothe, who also helped him with the application process. Once he was accepted into the program, the next challenge was paying for the trip.
“I was lucky to get funded by USG,” Liu said. “The Academic and Professional Funding Board covered the program fee of the trip. I just wanted to say thanks to them.”
A medical school hopeful, Liu plans on eventually becoming a physician and working in health administration or health policy. Liu felt the German conference was a great fit for like-minded students interested in community-based approaches to health care.
More experienced professionals and experts also provided a valuable learning and shared knowledge experience for attendees at the conference.
“My favorite part was being in the company of a lot of really intelligent and experienced professionals,” Liu said. “I absorbed so much from them just talking with them, spending a week with them. I think I learned a couple month’s worth of knowledge in that week.”
Germany, which has a compulsory health insurance system, is a stark contrast to the U.S.’s privatized health care system. The recently passed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, however, means that learning about the ways that other countries provide government insurance for their citizens is more pertinent than ever before for American citizens.
“Going through conferences and discussions with [policymakers] gave me a better understanding of how health care works and how the German system differs from the U.S. health care system,” Liu said. “Different debates and points of contention gave me a better understanding and a better appreciation of how health care works, and that helps me as a future physician to understand the system I’ll be in.”
Germany requires all citizens purchase health insurance, but the government only sponsors, not directly controls, the health care system.
“It’s not a socialist system, as many Americans tend to think. It’s less expensive overall because they don’t pay their doctors as much as they do here,” Liu said. “Both systems have advantages and disadvantages, and I’m not trying to side with the German health care system, but it’s really interesting to see how it works and why they picked it, and to compare it to the United States.”
During the conference, Liu had the opportunity to travel to smaller cities in Germany that he had never had the chance to visit before.
Between visiting medical technology firm Drägerwerk AG’s world headquarters in Lubeck; attending MEDICA, the largest medical trade fair in the world; and learning about the German health care system in Bonn, Liu put his German language skills to use.
“I got to experience German culture again,” Liu said. “I haven’t been abroad in quite some time. It was nice to get away and experience a different culture.”

Experts debated the use of learning the humanities for students in 21st century universities during a panel discussion at Doheny Memorial Library on Monday.
The panelists, which included Pascal Arnaud, a professor of history at the Université Lumière Lyon 2; Peggy Kamuf, a professor of French and comparative literature and English; and Vanessa Schwartz, a professor of history, all agreed that the methods of instructing humanities are changing.

Arnaud argued that the new emergence of technology requires instructors within the humanities to infuse technology in their teaching methods, such as using digital libraries. Historically, Arnaud said technology and the humanities have been viewed as complete opposites, but borrowing ideas from digital learning could help the study of the humanities advance.
“We need to use the enemy’s method,” Arnaud said. “We should explore a new way and create impact factors in the humanities section. The future of the humanities is basically in the digital humanities.”
Arnaud emphasized that the United States and Europe view this instruction differently based on the respective structures of their university systems. However, he believed the same things could be applied to both the United States and Europe.
Kamuf agreed with the need to incorporate technology, although she said she believes it is important to maintain the standards of teaching the humanities.
“We cannot accept the agreement that we should be like them, but no, we have to be different in the classroom,” Kamuf said. “We must acknowledge that [studying the humanities] won’t work for all students, but it will inspire some that have never thought about the humanities.”
Schwartz said she believes the study of humanities is fundamental to the growth of a student, regardless of their chosen discipline.
“Every person, even an engineer or scientist, has a book that changed them,” Schwartz said. “Or a painting that changed their lives. So the capacity to learn and think doesn’t change and that is what the students learn when they come to college.”
Despite the disagreement among the panelists over the current state of the humanities on college campuses, all of them believed the humanities could be made stronger through more collaboration.
The USC Sidney Harman Academy of Polymathic Study and the Early Modern Studies Institute hosted the panel. Throughout the year, the academy offers a series of conversations that align with the four quadrants of Polymathic inquiry, intended to raise integrated interdisciplinary awareness among the student body.
Benji Ng, a sophomore majoring in communication, believes exploring interdisciplinary studies can be useful.
“I think there’s a lot of things that we get bombarded with at college,” Ng said. “Because we’re still young the professors believe we’re still able to strive for idealism. Plus these panels let me discuss things that don’t usually come up in class.”
“Benji Ng, a sophomore majoring in communication,” sounds quite bright.

Los Angeles Mayoral candidate Emanuel Pleitez gave students a glimpse of his views on education policy at a Monday night event in the Taper Hall of Humanities.

The event, hosted by USC’s Political Student Assembly and Teach for America, drew a crowd of about 30 people. Justin Bogda, the assistant director of the Political Student Assembly and a junior majoring in environmental studies and international relations, and Maheen Sahoo, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, who serves as a campus campaign coordinator for Teach for America at USC, organized the event.
Emanuel Pleitez, 29, currently serves as chief strategy officer at Spokeo, a technology company in Los Angeles. After graduating from Stanford in 2006, Pleitez worked at Goldman Sachs, was a member of the Obama-Biden Presidential Transition Team, a member of the President’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board and a management consultant for McKinsey and Company. Pleitez also previously served as current Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa’s personal assistant.
Aside from his professional qualifications, Pleitez discussed how his experience as an Angeleno has impacted his campaign for mayor.
Pleitez emphasized how his own childhood experiences as a first-generation American in the Los Angeles Unified School District inspired him to make education one of his focuses. He proposed possible solutions Los Angeles can undertake to improve public schools and  advocated reapportioning the city budget.
Pleitez highlighted some statistics from LAUSD schools in his presentation, which indicate why the school district seems to be struggling.
“There’s so many variables at play, from the biggest indicator of student success being the education level of parents. In L.A., if you did a study just on that, we’re already at the bottom of almost every region in the country,” he said.
Bogda said he hoped the event would help get students thinking about the importance of education.
“I think going to such a big school in South Central Los Angeles that kind of works with the community, having partnerships with a bunch of different high schools, a bunch of different feeder programs, makes education really relevant,” Bogda said.
The panel, composed of Teach for America teachers Lila Kalaf and Zachary Sokoloff in addition to educators Sean Holiday and Baltazar Vega, analyzed education and policy in Los Angeles. Art Auerbach, an assistant professor of political science, moderated the discussion.
Though they saw many problems with the public education system, panelists did acknowledge that the recently passed Proposition 30 gives schools some leeway. The proposition created a tax plan to raise money that prevents budget cuts in education.
“Prop. 30 passing allows us to breathe a little bit more so we can focus on where we get to spend our resources and we get to think a little bit more clearly,” Vega said.
Panelists also touched on the influence that charter schools have on the education system overall. Holiday and Vega, administrators at L.A.-area charter schools, said the fact that these schools function as a meritocracy makes them valuable indicators of learning.
“One thing I like about charter schools is that if we’re doing bad, we’re no longer going to exist,” said Vega.
Sokoloff also added that a benefit of charter schools is that they can be “laboratories of innovation” and he hopes work on the education system doesn’t end there.
“I really hope the charter school movement turns into finding ways to bridge the gap between district schools and charter schools,” Sokoloff said.
Despite some of the hurdles L.A. schools will face in the coming months, Pleitez remained hopeful.
“For the future, am I optimistic?” Pleitez asked. “Absolutely, because we’ve gone through so much.”

Turnover, turnover, followed by six straight misses.
That’s how the USC men’s basketball team began Sunday night’s home matchup against No. 25 San Diego State, a game that ended in a 66-60 defeat for the Trojans.

USC got off to an abysmal start, trailing 18-5 midway through the first half. That gap eventually reached 19 points at 29-10 before USC went on a 13-6 run to make it 35-23 going into the halftime break.
“The biggest thing is the way we came out of the gate,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “We can’t be down 19 in the first half at home and really expect to fight hard enough to get back into it.”
The Trojans shot just 8-31 (26 percent) from the floor in the first half. USC missed its first six 3-point attempts and was outrebounded by six early on even with a major height advantage.
“We’ve got to start converting, shooting the ball better,” O’Neill said. “I liked our shot selection for the most part.”
But the Trojans did fight back in the second half, going on an 11-2 run to cut SDSU’s advantage to 37-34. From there, the two teams exchanged baskets back and forth, with USC even taking the lead 41-39 with 13:32 remaining.
“How we came out in the second half is how we’ve got to start the game,” junior forward Dewayne Dedmon said.
Critical mental mistakes down the stretch, however, doomed the USC comeback. With 2:18 remaining and the Trojans down 56-55, junior center Omar Oraby was called for a technical foul for making contact with Aztec guard Jamaal Franklin after the whistle blew. The score quickly ballooned to 61-55, an unreachable deficit with so little time remaining. In the closing moments, sophomore guard Byron Wesley committed an intentional foul in an apparent fit of anger.
“We’ve got a bunch of new guys,” O’Neill said. “We did all the right things down the stretch against Texas in a tight game. In this situation, the immaturity of the emotional stuff — you can’t overcome that in a tight game against a good team. It’s not acceptable, it’s not professional, it’s not winning basketball.”
Senior point guard Jio Fontan was quick to shoulder some of the blame for failing to keep the rest of the team composed down the stretch.
“It’s me and K.O.,” Fontan said. “Got a lot more to do with me than K.O. because I’m on the court, and I’ve got to do a better job of controlling the guys on the court and being in control myself.”
Senior forward Eric Wise led the Trojans in scoring for the fourth time in six games, putting up 14 points and seven rebounds in the loss, which dropped USC to 3-3 on the season. O’Neill was highly complimentary of Wise’s play following the game.
“He’s a heck of a player,” O’Neill said. “He does it all — scores, rebounds, assists, playmaker, [is a] smart player. Got a chance to have a really good year in his senior season. He’s a guy that is probably our No. 2 playmaker behind Jio. That’s why he’s so valuable to us.”
USC’s backcourt, on the other hand, struggled to shoot the ball again as Fontan, Wesley and junior guard J.T. Terrell combined to shoot just 6-29 for the game.
“We’re not making shots,” O’Neill said. “Our three perimeter guys shot 6-29 again. It’s tough to win with that number. I liked their shots — they’ve got to keep being aggressive, keep shooting and attacking the basket, doing the things that will help us win.”
The Trojans do have a few positives to take from the game, as they recovered in the rebounding department to finish with 43 boards compared to 36 for the Aztecs. And though NBA prospect and junior guard Jamaal Franklin finished with 17 points — tied with senior guard James Rahon’s 17 for the team high — he did so on an inefficient 4-of-15 shooting.
“It was a great basketball game, both teams played hard and played well,” O’Neill added. “Unfortunately, we gave into some things at the end that don’t make sense in a tight game like that, you just can’t do it.”

Saturday’s rivalry game against Notre Dame featured an unfamiliar sight at the Coliseum.
The Trojan faithful saw a very casual-looking Matt Barkley on the gridiron: no pads, no cleats, no helmet and, most importantly, no footballs thrown by his record-setting right arm.
The senior signal caller, who missed the game because of an AC sprain, strode out onto the field for Senior Day wearing, more or less, gym clothes. He held USC’s victory ‘V’ high above his head with his left arm, saluting the fans and then embracing his coach.
After UCLA linebacker Anthony Barr, who leads the Pac-12 in sacks, planted USC’s four-year starter on a blindside hit in the Trojans’ 38-28 defeat at the Rose Bowl, redshirt freshman Max Wittek was selected to step up to the plate.
It wasn’t a storybook start for Wittek, who completed 14 of 23 passes for 186 yards and one touchdown as the Trojans fell 22-13 to the Fighting Irish. Though the 19-year-old gunslinger gave up two interceptions and took two sacks on his debut, USC coach Lane Kiffin said the Mater Dei alumnus played with poise.
“Max did really well for the situation,” Kiffin said. “I thought that in his first start in a national stage game versus what some people would call the best defense in the country … he did a good job handling himself.”
After the game, Barkley also told Wittek he was proud of him.
“You played your heart out,” Barkley said, according to Wittek. “Mistakes will come.”
Wittek’s sole touchdown toss came at the beginning of the second quarter, when he found junior wide receiver Robert Woods for an 11-yard score that would put USC’s first points on the board.
But perhaps more important than his statistical output, Wittek steps away from his first start with a taste of what’s expected of him.
“I believe: Take it as it comes,” Wittek said. “I definitely got a lot of great experience out there today against a great defense. They’ve been stopping offenses all year. I think there’s a lot to learn from, and I look forward to watching the tape.”
Lee and Woods 
Upon reeling in catch No. 112, sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee broke teammate Robert Woods’ Pac-12 single-season receptions record. Record aside, Lee finished the night with 75 yards and no touchdowns, connecting with Wittek for only five receptions.
On a 13-play, 80-yard drive, though, Wittek rifled Lee a crucial four-yard pass, which appeared to be caught in the end zone. But before the snap, Kiffin called a timeout, which nullified the potential six points.
“We’re pretty synced up together,” Wittek said of Lee. “Just a couple of balls, maybe I should have put them further to the outside to give him a better chance to make a play, but with a guy like Marqise, a lot of times you can just throw it up there and he can make the play for you.”
Though his single-season record was broken, Woods had a standout day at the Coliseum, finishing with seven catches for 92 yards and one touchdown. The junior looked like the Trojans’ most potent offensive weapon, despite what has felt like a season-long focus on Lee’s playmaking abilities.
Trojan fans will await Woods’ decision this offseason as to whether he will enter the 2013 NFL Draft. Woods did not confirm after the game whether he would seek an evaluation from NFL scouts.
The luck o’ the Irish
No. 1 Notre Dame finished Saturday’s game with a commanding nine-point lead, keeping the Trojans at bay and essentially advancing to the BCS national championship game.
The Irish defense consistently tightened up in the red zone, creating a couple frustrating goal-line possessions for the Trojans and pinning USC’s offense to finish 1 of 9 on third- and fourth-down conversions.
“It’s so hard to score touchdowns versus them — the ball’s on the 2-inch line, you think you could score touchdowns there,” Kiffin said. “You’d like to think that with that many snaps you could at least score a touchdown.”
Led by linebacker and Heisman Trophy candidate Manti Te’o, who finished the night with five tackles and one interception, Notre Dame’s defense has only allowed eight touchdowns in 33 red zone possessions — the lowest ratio for any Football Bowl Subdivision defense in the last eight seasons.
The undefeated Irish will likely play the SEC champion, Alabama or Georgia, in January’s national championship in Miami. Alabama and Georgia face off Saturday at Atlanta’s Georgia Dome.
Turning a new leaf
The Trojans cap the regular season at 7-5 after what was projected to be a triumphant bout of “unfinished business.” USC is the first preseason No. 1 squad to end its season unranked since Ole Miss in 1964.
Bedeviled by turnovers, penalties and slow starts, the Trojans lost four of their last five games, including upset losses to UCLA and Arizona. Much of the trouble also stemmed from USC’s defense, including a problematic secondary, but players are looking forward to one last chance at some gridiron redemption.
“We got to soak it in,” sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard said of Saturday’s loss. “We have to prepare for the bowl game, we have to get ready for that.”
According to various projections, USC is expected to play in the Las Vegas Bowl, Sun Bowl or Holiday Bowl, although nothing has been confirmed.
Beyond their bowl game, the Trojans hope to make the necessary adjustments during the offseason to prepare for the 2013 season.
“We’re going to look at everything, just like we did last offseason,” Kiffin said. “We’re going to take our time and really go back and look at the whole season, and figure out where we can improve.”

marquis lee needs to learn to adjust to the ball earlier and to fight for the and catch it. His whining to the refs after being held is not appropriate, if he doesn’t try to finish the play. Fioght for the ball marquis and you’ll be even better prepared for the NFL.  That’s what they look for in WR.

With yet another major hurdle cleared, just one final push stands between the USC men’s water polo team and a fifth consecutive national championship. Last weekend, USC continued its businesslike ways in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, winning three games in as many days en route to claiming the championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament.
Off the charts · Junior driver Nikola Vavic’s 79 goals this season place him just three shy of the all-time single-season mark for USC. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
“It’s great to get this victory,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Our guys had a strong week of preparation, and a very good weekend against good teams. I was especially pleased with how we finished [on Sunday] compared to the other two games.”
The Trojans, the top seed in the field after completing a unbeaten regular season, wasted no time establishing superiority in the quarterfinals against eighth-seeded UC Santa Barbara. After beating the Gauchos twice in the regular season by an average of seven goals, the Trojans overwhelmed UCSB from the start. Thanks to a seven-goal barrage in the second quarter, USC took a 12-4 lead into halftime and never looked back.
Senior driver Michael Rosenthal paced the Trojans’ scoring with four goals, while a host of others contributed to a very balanced offensive attack. On the defensive side, junior goalie James Clark and sophomore goalie Ely Bonilla split time in the cage, with the former saving six shots and the latter saving five.
In the semifinal match, USC took on the fourth-seeded Cardinal. With an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament virtually secured, the significance of the game was slightly lowered, but a perfect record and a conference tournament championship still hung in the balance.
The teams’ first two meetings were extremely competitive. In the semifinals of the NorCal tournament in September, USC needed overtime to dispose of the Cardinal, winning by a score of 10-9. In their second meeting in October, USC was able to outlast Stanford in regulation, this time by a score of 9-6. This latest matchup was even closer, with the Trojans prevailing by a score of 11-10 to earn a spot in the finals.
Though the team led the match from start to finish, Stanford gave USC all it could handle in the high-stakes game. Both sides  traded goals in the first half and went into the break tied at four goals apiece. USC gained control of the match in the third quarter when a three-goal run gave the team an 8-5 lead. Goals by sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias, junior driver Nikola Vavic and junior utility Mace Rapsey gave the team enough of a cushion to withstand a furious late-game rally by Stanford.
In the fourth period, after both teams tallied goals to make the score 9-6, Stanford driver BJ Churnside ripped back-to-back goals to push the lead to just one goal. But Nikola Vavic responded by scoring his second goal of the game with just two minutes left to give USC a two-goal advantage.
But the Cardinal would not be turned away easily, as utility Alex Bowen scored his fourth goal of the night to again pull Stanford within one with 1:40 left to play. In desperate need of a clutch play to quell the Cardinal’s late rally, it was Rapsey to the rescue with a rebound backhand goal to again give the Trojans a two-goal advantage. Stanford was able to get one more goal in the dying moments of the game, but it was too late as the Trojans prevailed.
“Mac has played very well this whole tournament,” Jovan Vavic said. “When you have guys like Nikola and Kostas, who score the majority of our goals, they get most of the attention. But we have a lot of guys who can put up those kinds of numbers. That’s what’s going to happen in these types of games. Your top players may not score goals, so it was excellent to see. This was very important for him going into the NCAAs.”
In the Sunday finals against Cal, Rapsey would continue his stellar play in big moments. Cal, which needed a victory to earn a spot in the NCAA tournament, was without its top two players, drivers Collin Smith and Aleksa Saponjic, who were each ejected from earlier tournament matches and subsequently suspended. Their absence changed the way USC approached the game.
“They lost their two best players, so we were able to do more of a press defense,” Jovan Vavic said. “Some of their younger players have problems with that, so we wanted to apply a little more pressure with those two guys not out there.”
USC’s defense was dominant in the first half, only allowing one goal and causing many Cal turnovers. Two goals by Rapsey and one by Genidounias gave the Trojans a 3-1 halftime lead.
USC continued its stellar play in the third quarter, and it looked as if they would run away with the championship with ease. Nikola Vavic scored his only goal of the game, his 79th of the season, early in the period to give USC the 4-1 lead. Rapsey struck again shortly after, giving the junior his first hat trick of the season, and senior two-meter Matt Burton scored a mere thirty seconds later to push the lead to 6-1.
But the Golden Bears roared back, scoring four goals in the last three minutes of the quarter to bring the score to 7-5, with USC’s seventh goal coming on Rapsey’s fourth of the game and eighth of the tournament. Cal seemed to have all the momentum, but the USC defense buckled down.
“We just needed to keep composed,” Clark said. “Our fitness was going to push us through. It was definitely tough, though. The previous two games, we let our composure slip in the fourth quarter, so it was positive to see us not do that in this game.”
The defense clamped down and the Bears were shut out in the final frame. USC tacked on two goals by Burton and junior two-meter Connor Virjee to seal the deal and win 9-5 to capture the title and push their record to a staggering 27-0 heading into the final weekend of the season.
“It’s great to still be undefeated,” Rapsey said. “We played good defense today, something we’ve wanted to improve on from the last two games. Scoring goals doesn’t mean anything to me, though. Defense is what’s going to win us these big games. Having a good team effort, that’s all I’m worried about.”
Modest as he might be, Rapsey’s play was crucial in this tournament and is something the team is going to have to see more of in the final stretch. Jovan Vavic acknowledged that in the big games, it’s going to take the whole team to get the job done.
But with the ultimate prize well within reach, the coach who has experienced the most success a person can at this level stressed the importance of staying the course and appreciating the ride to a possible championship. When asked about his team’s approach to the championship tournament, the smile on his face as he answered suggested that he most definitely is enjoying a journey that he has made many times before.
“At this point, there’s nothing you can change,” Jovan Vavic said. “You just have to go with what you’ve got here, focus on your defense, and continue to work hard. But mainly, though, you’ve really just got to relax and enjoy it.”

Go ahead and argue the expectations were too high. Feel free to question whether USC, once the Associated Press’ preseason No. 1 team, was overhyped heading into this season — that a top-10 rank in August was unbefitting for this group.
But before you rant about premature predictions from the summer, before you declare that the hype and the added attention were unwarranted, think back to Nov. 26, 2011: Thanksgiving weekend roughly one year ago.
There was quarterback Matt Barkley, then a junior, standing atop a ladder in front of a USC student section in the northeast corner of the Coliseum, conducting a few remaining band members. The No. 10 Trojans had just defeated UCLA by a now-infamous score of 50-0 to cap off a perfect November, which included a three-point upset win over Oregon at Autzen Stadium the week prior.
Remember, they closed 2011 with seven wins in eight games.
They were improving each week, they were talented and they returned many of those talented players — nine of 11 offensive starters — heading into this season.
There were myriad reasons to rank USC highly in the preseason and just as many to insist the Trojans’ ceiling stood several floors higher than this season’s eventual 7-5 finish — the latest defeat coming last Saturday against No. 1 Notre Dame.
Nonetheless, we’ve reached the Monday morning quarterbacking stage where we attempt to string together explanations for, at least statistically, the most disappointing finish for a preseason top-ranked team since 1964. And oddly, the latest idea gaining steam is, naturally: the expectations were too [darn] high.
“We were probably overhyped at the beginning of the year, being perfectly honest,” Athletic Director Pat Haden said Wednesday in an ESPN Radio interview.
Sorry, I’m not buying it, even coming from Haden.
That notion is misguided, and more than anything stands as a cover for the sobering reality: This was a gross mismanagement of elite talent.
There are reasons the hype took off in the first place — because of that talent, because of that finish of 2011. And that talent, with decorated All-Americans galore, never evaporated this year.
As announced Monday, 19 USC players were named to various All-Pac-12 teams at the conclusion of the season, in addition to other honors, most notably sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee’s selection as the conference’s offensive player of the year.
The roster has its weaknesses, of course. But so does every roster. And though USC’s roster is capped at 75 scholarship players because of NCAA sanctions, it’s been well documented that quite a number of schools, such as Georgia and LSU, aren’t playing with a full roster of 85. Not to mention USC coach Lane Kiffin has admitted he played less than 50 scholarship players in 2011 — a 10-win season.
So let’s stop crying about talent, roster limitations and expectations. This is USC, right?
We’re reminded so often that this program boasts more NFL draft picks in history than any other school. We’re told how great its recruiting classes have been over the last decade, especially since Kiffin arrived on campus nearly three years ago.
So are we really to believe that mighty ole ’SC wasn’t as talented as UCLA? Or as Arizona? Or heck, even Oregon?
There are potential first-round picks on both offense and on defense, but that never translated to Saturdays.
Of the Trojans’ seven wins in 2012, only three came against teams with winning records —  Syracuse, Washington and Arizona State. Moreover, they failed to defeat a single team ranked in the top 25 for the first time since the 1997 season.
You can fault whomever you’d like — Kiffin, his father Monte, who’s tasked with running the defense, or anyone else — because there is, of course, enough blame to dish around for months.
But don’t buy the company line. Lofty expectations were never the issue.
Simply, talented USC was a No. 1 team that belly flopped in front of the 90,000 faithful.

Sure the blame for a 7-5 USC team starts with the coaches. However, you ignore the fact that the players throw INTs, drop passes, fumble, make penalties, miss blocks and miss tackles. When a team with at least as much talent (according to the media) as 2011 that finished 10-2 and No. 6 and with mostly the same coaches, makes so many execution mistakes you have to hold the players accountable. I read every article about USC spring, fall and season practices, and no one criticized the coaches for not preparing the players. No one predicted that USC would lose 5 games as a result of poor preparation. To write this article after the fact is easy. Why didn’t you predict that USC would not do well this year since you attended the practices last year and this one? I think that if you ask the players, they will admit that the mistakes they made were mostly their fault and it cost USC 5 losses.
Great points. While I do fault the coaching for a lot of bad plays on both sides of the ball, we can’t overlook Barkley’s shockingly, yet consistent, poor decision-making. Marquis Lee, as good as he is, has coughed it up usually once per game. And why aren’t we throwing to Woods and Agholor more often? They are both insanely good and take care of the ball (TE’s also!). Silas Redd, while not a bust, hasn’t done enough and fumbled way too many times. Why not use Curtis McNeil more? He had some fumbles, but had some great games near the end of the season. And the sudden crumbling of this defense is probably worst of all. If we had made one or two more stops, ND wouldn’t be headed for Miami.
I do blame the coaching staff for not putting together a complete, solid performance all year. EVERY game was cringe-worthy, and I haven’t even brought up the number of penalties (among the worst in the country, many of them just plain dumb and undisciplined) and missed tackles. It’s truly sad how a team with so many returning starters and a lot more to play for this time around NEVER improved from one week to the next, let alone over the entire season. Our team is projected to go to the Sun Bowl. We share records with the Arizona schools. I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, unashamed: our team was the most overrated in the country this year. I personally don’t think the expectations were too high – this team had plenty of talent to win it all this year, or at least the Rose Bowl. Last year, they could have beat down anyone, and I mean anyone, in the country at the end of the season. This drop-off is alarming.
In my view, Stanford is the only team we should have lost to (well, we shouldn’t have lost any, but oh well). I underestimated just how good they are, even without Andrew Luck. Oregon’s D is as crappy as ours, UCLA didn’t cough up the ball every other play, Arizona is terrible, and I still don’t really buy Notre Dame (have you seen the pansies on their schedule that they eeked away from?).
I believe the unexpected loss to Stanford was the start of the downfall of the season. Finally playing against
that team w/o Andrew Luck to bail them out, a win was definitely anticipated. Once that loss occurred Kiffin
played to not lose for a second loss would eliminate the team from possible BCS title or top tier bowl game
except the Rose Bowl. The Washington game was a prime example leading 24 – 7 at halftime and then not
scoring in the 2nd half being conservative to hold on when UW fumbled at the three yard line in 4th qtr. Talent
more than enough for a ten win season.

Given the opportunity to upset No. 1 Notre Dame in the 84th edition of the storied intersectional rivalry, USC flashed the talent and explosiveness that emboldened many preseason prognosticators to ticket the Trojans — not the Irish — for a date in January’s BCS national championship game in Miami.
Goal-line stand · After a pass interference penalty gave USC a first-and-goal at the one-yard line in the fourth quarter, the Trojans couldn’t advance the ball on any of their next four plays. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Unfortunately, the Trojans were once again bedeviled by inopportune miscues en route to a 22-13 loss before a sellout crowd of 93,607 fans, many of whom were cheering on the Irish’s special season.
“It’s very difficult for everyone in our locker room with so many things not going well this season,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I was hoping today we would finish different with the backup quarterback and be part of history, knocking [Notre Dame] out of the national championship game.”
Continuing their recent trend of slow starts, the Trojans quickly fell behind 10-0 only a week after digging themselves into a 24-point hole at UCLA in the first half. After Notre Dame kicker Kyle Brindza’s 27-yard field goal on the first series and a fruitless drive for USC on its first possession, Notre Dame rattled off a 12-play, 87-yard drive, which tailback Theo Riddick capped with a nine-yard touchdown scamper after the Irish converted three separate third-down opportunities. On the evening, Riddick rushed for 146 yards on 20 carries and accounted for the Irish’s only touchdown.
“They were powerful today,” sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard said of the Notre Dame offense. “It was electrifying out there; kudos to most of their offensive linemen. They recognized our defense and got up to the second level and were able to run up and down.”
Undeterred, redshirt freshman quarterback Max Wittek, after missing his first three passes in the previous series, roared back with five consecutive completions in a drive that culminated in an 11-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Robert Woods.
“Woody’s a great receiver, and he’s so smart,” Wittek said. “He knows defenses, so it’s easy to be on the same page with a guy like that.”
During the Senior Day festivities before the contest, senior quarterback Matt Barkley strode out of the Coliseum tunnel in street clothes, stopping to embrace Kiffin, before flashing the victory ‘V’ sign to the Coliseum faithful.
Kiffin momentarily choked up upon describing the scene in his post-game media session.
“It’s just wrong,” Kiffin said of Barkley’s injury. “That shouldn’t have happened to that kid. I just felt for him, my heart just felt for him. That kid didn’t deserve for it to end like that.”
Wittek, Barkley’s replacement, valiantly embraced the steep challenge of facing the NCAA’s No. 1 scoring defense — Notre Dame only allowed 10.1 points per game before Saturday — and subbing in for the fan favorite Barkley.
“Obviously the circumstances with Matt not being able to play in the game is what really sucks about it,” said Wittek, who finished his starting debut 14 of 23 for 186 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. “Looking at him, being with him the past five to six years at Mater Dei and then here … for him to not be able to play in this rivalry game — this last home game — was pretty sad.”
Notre Dame and USC proceeded to trade field goals in their next possessions before USC had the ball with 1:25 remaining in the first half and trailing by three points.
Wittek squandered the opportunity to pull USC ahead, however, as he lofted a pass — intended for sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee — approximately 70 yards down field that Notre Dame cornerback KeiVarae Russell hauled in for an interception.
The Irish capitalized on the turnover in their subsequent offensive possession. After moving the ball to USC’s 35-yard line with 10 seconds remaining, quarterback Everett Golson scrambled for eight seconds before rifling a pass that fell incomplete. Unluckily for USC, time had yet to expire in the half, giving the Irish the chance to eke a 52-yard field goal over the uprights’ crossbar, which staked them to a 16-10 lead at halftime.
The second half also began inauspiciously, as Heisman Trophy candidate Manti Te’o snared his seventh interception of the season on Wittek’s first pass. The game continued to spiral out of control for USC as the Trojans’ offense failed to find the end zone.
“Notre Dame showed me that they have phenomenal senior leadership,” Kiffin said. “You can see those guys understand the game; they’re not very exotic, but they don’t screw up.”
Following the Irish’s fourth field goal, USC countered with a 13-play, 80-yard drive in which it appeared the Trojans scored a touchdown on a four-yard completion to Lee. Before the play, however, Kiffin called a timeout, thus negating the score. After an unsuccessful third-down attempt, USC settled for a 21-yard field goal.
Further fueling the frustration, USC was set up at Notre Dame’s 1-yard line with four minutes remaining in the game, seeking to score a touchdown to draw the score to 22-20. After two unsuccessful quarterback sneaks and a stuffed run play for senior tailback Curtis McNeal, Kiffin called for a play-action rollout pass to redshirt freshman fullback Soma Vainuku. Vainuku bobbled the pass and the ball squirted between his legs. hitting the ground and effectively sealing the defeat.
“In the second half I thought we didn’t move the ball very well, especially in the third quarter on offense,” Kiffin said. “They’re the No. 1 goal line defense in the country two years in a row for a reason.”
USC must now regroup for its bowl game after losing both of its rivalry games this season and dropping four of five contests.
“No one imagined losing five games with the talent that we have,” Wittek said. “Things didn’t exactly turn out how we wanted them to, but I couldn’t express any more pride in my team — being able to go to battle with them was definitely special.”

Dear Pat (Hayden),
We know you gave Kiffin your endorsement that he is your coach. We know how hard it is to fire a coach especially when most of the team after today are his recruits. If I had to guess, you are as frustrated as we all are after a season of miscues, excuses and an unwillingness to adjust and learn from previous mistakes.
We were out-coached in many of our games, especially in the second half’s when the opposing coaches made adjustments to us but we did not adjust to them. Even in the games we won, in many cases we were pretty much shut out in the second half and hung on.
My other observation is that a team reflects it’s coach. When I see a Kiffin team, I see a team that lacks motivation and tries to play it cool. When I saw a Carroll team, I saw an upbeat, excited, better disciplined team focuses on winning.
My suggestion is that of many other frustrated Trojan fans who looked forward to going to a nice BCS bowl game this year:
1. Get  an offensive coordinator and stop calling plays from the field (we like the highlight play too much and don’t focus on a sustained drives)
2. Get a new defensive coordinator because if I had to look, I bet our defense on 3rd down is one of the, if not the, worst in the country (Defense wins championships…not flashy offensives…just look at the Oregon game)
3. Use our tight-end more when our top receivers are being double teamed and keyed on.
4. Make adjustments at half-time
5. Take chances!!!!!!!!
Let’s recap shall we, We lost by 9 points. The coach called a time out on the second to the last drive and cost us a touchdown. We kicked a  field goal. That cost us 4 points On the last drive Marquise Lee caught the ball on the 2 yard lines with 5:40 left on the clock, but Lanie Kiffin could find a play in his laminated sheet of plays so we ran it into the teeth of the defense until the clock basically ran out. That’s 7 points. Now lets do the math, 4+7 =11. Sounds like he was using the same laminated sheet he used in the 2005 National championship vs. Texas.
Kiffin has to go…he is a crappy coach…having this much talent and this many lossess (especailly against UCLA and not Notre Dame) is disgusting

Surrealism is embedded in the everyday, in the daily experience.”
Not a lot of people would agree with Dartmouth professor Katharine Conley’s view of the surrealist art movement — after all, it’s not every day that you spot a woman with a fish body or a giant eyeball looming over skyscrapers.
When it comes to surrealist art, the weird reigns supreme. As artists delve into their subconsciouses and bring strange visions to life, their art becomes something that is at times disturbing but always fascinating.
The Los Angeles County Museum of Art’s “Drawing Surrealism” captures the alluring, sometimes puzzling nature of surrealist art in a show that traces the movement’s influence on artists around the world. These artists do not hesitate to manifest even their most complex, fantastical ruminations into works of art for the world to see, and the artists’ risk-taking makes them veritable role models for today’s artists. The show recreates the feeling of adventure and whimsy these artists exemplified, down to small curatorial decisions, such as decorating the wall outlets with thin lines that branched out in all directions.
Spanish surrealist artist Adriano del Valle’s collage “Dompteur d’éléphants (Elephant Tamer)” particularly demonstrates this adventurous sensibility. The work shows two hands on the right hand side, the only hint of the rest of the anonymous person indicated by a bit of shirt material showing by the right wrist. The hands lead the viewer’s gaze right into the work, which feels like a snapshot of a strange circus dream. In the middle of a rocky landscape, seven elephants engage in a variety of absurd movements reminiscent of a circus show. Three pose on what look like decorative stands, two balance themselves on a plank and another two frolic on either side.
The scene seems funny and frivolous at first glance, but it very much summarizes the approach of surrealist artists. Through their works, they construct their own worlds where anything goes. The tamer in this work perhaps fails at controlling the elephants — or perhaps the animal actually serves as his own creation. Just as the trainer uses only his hands to direct the elephant in their tricks, surrealists use their hands to project personal musings onto the canvas. In the space of a single work, they can bring to life images that perhaps supersede any real or concrete explanation. Every work leads the viewer into another world, defying the need for order and especially reality.
“Dompteur d’éléphants (Elephant Tamer)” can serve as guidance for today’s artists for transforming the canvas into a completely different world. Even today, the works of the surrealist artist still take viewers out of the present, catapulting them into something inexplicably tangled. Relatively small and mounted within a simple frame, “Dompteur d’éléphants (Elephant Tamer)” beckons the viewer to look more closely and, when doing so, forget about the reality around them. Artists should take that as inspiration; when a canvas manages to pull the viewer in so they forget about their surroundings, something special occurs.
Though surrealism might seem like one of the most difficult aesthetics to understand, it comes from a very basic desire to explore human emotions that speak to a range of viewers. “Dompteur d’éléphants (Elephant Tamer)” could be seen as the illustration of a person’s desire to create a completely new world. Perhaps one viewer or another also wishes, in a sense, that he or she could control a few elephants in their lives. The piece, then, beckons the viewer into a strange alteration of reality that ultimately portrays a very universal emotion: the desire to control one’s life.
It’s difficult to know exactly what a surrealist artist intends by his or her piece. Ultimately, these open-ended questions left behind by surrealists should also inform today’s artist. For the most part, today’s most popular and commercially viable works of art live off recognizable and easy-to-digest images. And though being commercially successful doesn’t make an artist any less talented at his or her craft, sometimes the more impactful works of art go beyond being simply aesthetically pleasing. Even if artists already possess the ability to create stunning pieces, they can take a leaf out of the surrealists’ book to create more mentally engaging, emotionally vibrant works.
On the surface, “Dompteur d’éléphants (Elephant Tamer)” seems visually clean, but it ultimately manages to raise questions that get viewers thinking. Just the right combination of imagery, along with a thought-provoking title, makes the piece worthy of conversation among viewers and becomes inspiration for artists in any era.
In a way, “Dompteur d’éléphants (Elephant Tamer)” feels like the manifesto of the surrealist movement. Through collage, drawing and more, surrealist artists created timeless images; they took the canvas and used it to their own aims just as the elephant tamer manages to get his elephants to perform a variety of tricks. The fact that a group of artists looking to get more connected to their subconscious became some of the most influential figures in art history speaks volumes. When artists truly put parts of themselves on the canvas, something complex takes place. In the space of the canvas, they manifest their identity. Surrealist pieces might seem completely strange on the surface, but, when viewed as a connection between the artist and observer, they ultimately speak to the most normal of human experiences.
 
“Drawing Surrealism” runs until Jan. 6. LACMA is located at 5905 Wilshire Blvd.

Barbara Kingsolver’s new novel Flight Behavior wrestles with change and progress both on a small and large scale,. Though the novel has its flaws, particularly with an uncomfortably slow and dense beginning, it eventually grows to be as beautiful, thought-provoking and complex as the monarch butterfly, the catalyst of its action. As the novel grapples with highly controversial and important issues such as progress and its resulting casualties, the novel ultimately leaves readers with a question: “What is the use of staying in a world that has no soul?”
Flight Behavior follows Dellarobia Turnbow, a poor farmwife seemingly cursed to a life of monotonous motherhood that is only interrupted by her controlling in-laws. Dellarobia’s misery and boredom drive her into the arms of adultery with a telephone repairman. Only a mile away from the rendezvous, she’s stopped short by the sight of what she thinks to be an act of God: the fiery and overwhelming presence of millions of monarch butterflies coating the trees and swirling through the air.
These butterflies become the center of Flight Behavior, their fight for survival mirroring that of Dellarobia’s. The butterflies, native to Mexico, have never been seen in the mountains of Southern Appalachia, and their appearance  becomes a national news phenomenon and draws the attention of expert Dr. Ovid Byron. He, along with his colleagues, sets up a lab in the Turnbow’s old sheep barn, effectively invading the Turnbow’s life and irrevocably involving their family in science and the fight to convince the general populace about science’s validity. Dellarobia and her family can’t help but be sucked into the work in their backyard, and it is through Dellarobia’s interaction with science and the potential end of a species that the novel progresses and grows.
With a plot that focuses more on themes and metaphors than a series of dramatic events, perhaps the novel’s greatest strength is the prose; Kingsolver, as she has done with her bestselling novels The Poisonwood Bible, The Lacuna and Prodigal Summer, yet again weaves words together to produce beauty in a place of poverty and pain. The pastor uses “his hands to push and pull his congregants as if kneading dough and making grace rise,” the air in the forest was “filled with quivering butterfly light” and initially Dellarobia’s life was “measured in half dollars and clipped coupons and culled hopes flattened between uninsulated walls.” The prose makes Dellarobia and her life relatable and undeniably, painfully realistic, highlighting the initial smallness of her world and emphasizing the close intimacy of the encounters shown to the reader.
A complaint, though, is that the setting and initial life of Dellarobia and her family are somewhat over-described and emphasized. Kingsolver states, shows and highlights the monotony and seeming emptiness of Dellarobia’s life — and then repeats the process excessively. The establishment of this monotony might be necessary for the story’s emotional impact, but its depiction outstays its welcome and, as a result, the beginning of the book drags too heavily. New details are just new details supporting the same argument, rather than changing or fine-tuning Kingsolver’s theme; characters are specified but not deepened.
But just when readers think they’ve settled in for another 300 pages of painful empathy in a world of repetitive dreariness, Flight Behavior picks up and becomes nearly impossible to put down. At its heart the novel is about climate change: The butterflies have come because of a change in a genetically coded, time-tested pattern that is, according to Dr. Byron, caused by global warming. Kingsolver introduces an element of quiet suspense when Dr. Byron clarifies that almost the entire population of monarch butterflies is in the mountains — and if it gets too cold or too warm at any point during the winter, the entire species could become extinct.
In Flight Behavior, the issue of global warming highlights the differences in class and perspective, showing both sides how little they understand the realities of their opposition. Dr. Byron is shocked to learn that Dellarobia’s high school only taught two levels of math, while Dellarobia struggles to integrate larger scientific theories into her family’s belief system, which is more concerned with lambing and sheep shearing than global environmental problems.
This underlying tension mirrors the everyday occurrences of Dellarobia’s life, which continues as normal even as she participates  in research. Readers experience the tension in her mismatched marriage, the revelation and growth of her character from all corners and the hope for her children and their futures. The dual progression of the butterflies and Dellarobia’s self-awareness strikingly evokes myriad fears: those of loss, change and the unknown for everyone in the story.
Unfortunately, through the exploration of the theme “science meets generally uneducated backwater town,” the scientific message of the novel isn’t so much gift-wrapped and placed in front of readers as is it beaten into them with a bat. The gravitas of the butterflies, climate change and the goals and aims of science are repeated too many times in too many ways in an attempt to further the reader’s comprehension of these themes. Readers understand the point when Dellarobia first learns it, when she tries to tell her husband, again when she tries to tell her mother-in-law and yet again when she discusses it with her best friend, Dovey. Though the theme is certainly relevant and each character displays a different reaction, the variations don’t add anything to the novel’s impact.
The slow beginning and the repetition of message, however, don’t eradicate the powerful effect this book might have on its readers. Though Flight Behavior employs one of the most obvious metaphors in literature — the metamorphosis of butterflies — this book is filled with complex intricacies and metaphors within metaphors. Even the grand theme of the butterfly isn’t out of place, as Dellarobia’s transformation and growth are as beautiful as the striking butterflies that she studies. The successful use of  metaphor speaks to Kingsolver’s masterful abilities as a writer and storyteller, making this novel a joy to experience despite its minor flaws.

It’s been decided. Everyone is coming to your house this holiday season. And the pressure is on to give family and friends the ultimate menu to dine on.
So what do you do?
Home cooking · Actor Stanley Tucci and British chef Yotam Ottolenghi both released new cookbooks in time for the holiday season. Both books focus on recipes that draw on the authors’ family heritages. – Hannah Nachef | Daily Trojan
Begin with deciding what to eat. Check out these new cookbooks for some inspiring ideas and tasty treats.
As a first option, A-lister Stanley Tucci just released The Tucci Cookbook, which is filled with flavorful dishes meant to be shared by the whole family.
The book contains a variety of both traditional and modern Italian meals, bringing the best of both Northern and Southern Italy. Highlights range from the Venetian seafood salad to spaghetti with tomato and tuna to eggplant and zucchini casserole with potatoes.
The nearly 200 recipes are even paired with wine recommendations to make the dining experience all the more complete and to give diners the full Italian experience.
If you are looking for something more traditional, Martha Stewart’s new book, Martha’s American Food: A Celebration of Our Nation’s Most Treasured Dishes, from Coast to Coast, is a collection of all the good ol’ American classics, from hamburgers to peach cobbler.
The book is divided into six sections, the first five representing different geographic locations around the United States: Northeast, South, Midwest, Southwest and West. The sixth section, called “All-American,” contains recipes that have become a staple in nearly every American household.
Perhaps the book’s most interesting pages are the ones that tell readers about the origins of certain American foods and ingredients. In these pages, readers can learn about the history behind the most delicious foods, from meatloaf to mayonnaise.
Martha’s recipes range from American classics such as roast turkey to new, innovative combinations such as fig pizza. The traditional, all-American cookbook would be a good place to start for any holiday meal.
If you are looking for a well-rounded cultural experience, check out Susan Feniger’s Street Food, a book containing recipes from nearly every corner of the world.
Feniger, a career foodie for over 30 years, gained her knowledge and inspiration for this cookbook from her world travels to places such as Vietnam, Turkey and Mongolia. Each of the 83 recipes in her book captures her travel experiences, bringing bold and exotic flavors to the table.
Stories of Feniger’s adventures and photos from her many vacations fill the book’s pages with a personal touch and add to the book’s cultural immersion.
With Feniger’s cookbook in hand, you can experience the iconic tastes of many foreign countries without leaving your kitchen.
Sticking with this cultural theme, Jerusalem natives Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi’s new book, Jerusalem: A Cookbook, provides a sense of the melting pot that is Jerusalem, with colorful recipes inspired by both the Arab East and Jewish West.
The cookbook contains 120 recipes that showcase the author-chefs’ cross-cultural experiences and bring together the bold flavors of the city, from both the home kitchen and street markets.
The recipes unfortunately call for ingredients that might be difficult to find, many being native to the region, but the delicious result at the end will make the search worthwhile. Plus, a trip to a specialty foods store can result in some great holiday gifts, as well.
But let’s say all of these culinary creations are a little too complicated for you to handle.  If this is the case, take a look at The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook, a book written by award-winning food blogger Deb Perelman.
Perelman’s philosophy is that home cooking should be easy and approachable. Her goal has been to create recipes that any food lover would be able to make.
The Smitten Kitchen Cookbook, Perelman’s first compilation of recipes, offers more than 100 recipes, all of which contain very accessible ingredients. The recipes are mostly new, but a few favorites from the blog make an appearance.
The cookbook also provides new and inventive ways of using everyday ingredients, such as asparagus on pizza or cauliflower in pesto. As a result, Perelman’s cookbook is perfect for the average cook looking to entertain and please a crowd, especially during the holidays.
But don’t think these cookbooks are only for the holiday season. Keith Wallace’s new cookbook Corked and Forked: Four Seasons of Eats and Drinks provides recipes for every occasion at any time of year.
From Sunday brunch to Thanksgiving dinner, this cookbook is packed with more than 100 recipes for both the extravagant palate and the quick fix.
Corked and Forked also provides diners opportunities to be adventurous with recipes like grilled watermelon salad and black pepper martinis.
This cookbook can further serve as an instructional guide for pairing dishes with the perfect drink. Not only does the book offer a suggested pairing for each recipe, but it also teaches home cooks how to select a fitting drink for each meal.
Wallace’s new cookbook is a good buy for year-round cooking and entertaining, making it an ideal gift for yourself and others.
Cookbooks get a lot of attention during the holidays, but the year-round appeal of the ones highlighted here make them the most worthwhile investment.

Metro ExpressLanes provide more options for students
The Metro ExpressLanes opened on Nov. 10 on Interstate 110, as the Daily Trojan reported. Because of USC’s proximity to the lanes, USC students, faculty and staff are in a unique position to take advantage of the ExpressLanes and other added transit options.
The project increases the capacity of I-110 and Interstate 10 by opening a portion of the carpool lanes to solo drivers willing to pay a toll and by expanding transit options. (The ExpressLanes on I-10 are set to open early next year.) All vehicles must have a FasTrak transponder to use the lanes.
Carpoolers and vanpoolers travel for free in the ExpressLanes with a FasTrak transponder, which allows them to indicate the number of occupants in the vehicle. This means students who currently carpool or vanpool can still travel for free in the lanes. Also, they can set up a carpool with friends and split the cost of a transponder, or join one of the many vanpools headed to campus.
Shifting solo drivers into the high occupancy toll lanes frees up space in the other lanes and helps reduce travel time for everyone.
The ExpressLanes use sensors to measure congestion and adjust the tolls as traffic increases. Overhead signs display the current toll so solo drivers can decide if they want to pay the toll or not.
Low-income residents can receive a discount on their account through an Equity Plan. While there is a monthly account maintenance fee, most commuters will not be charged the $3 fee because it is waived when drivers use the ExpressLanes four times in a month, and it is automatically waived for those in the Equity Plan.
Discounts can be found at Southern California AAA locations and participating Costco and Albertsons stores.
USC students can also take advantage of new transit benefits. The project is adding 59 clean-fuel buses and 100 vanpools to the ExpressLanes routes. The additional bus service means a bus runs every 10 minutes during rush hour on the Harbor Freeway. Plus, taking the bus will save gas and wear and tear on vehicles.

Support the Social Work Reinvestment Act 
Social work, known as the “helping profession,” has a long and proud history of advocating for individuals, families and communities. The core values of service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity and competence are ingrained in social work students from day one. However, low pay, long hours, high caseloads, job stress, significant educational debt and safety issues are the reality of many social workers today.
The safety net that social workers provide is needed more today than ever. Societal challenges that include the economic recession, homelessness, growing poverty, the aging baby boomers and the increase of war veterans all contribute to a growing need of competent and trained professional social workers. It is predicted there will be a shortage of 130,000 social workers by 2016.
Rep. Edolphus Towns (D-N.Y.), one of seven social workers in Congress, has introduced the Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work Reinvestment Act. This legislation establishes a commission to provide a comprehensive analysis, including long-term recommendations and strategies to enhance the ability of America’s social workers to serve all populations with competence and compassion.
The act also includes demonstration programs, which will address the realities faced by social workers and also create a national coordinating center to work with universities and research entities.
Though the United States is facing fiscal scrutiny in all areas, an investment into the social work profession is money in the bank. The far-reaching and long-term effects of a social service system that does not adequately address the needs of our population will be a costly endeavor not only in monetary terms but also in terms of the fabric and values of society.
The question remains of who will help the helping profession. I implore you to help and please look on our website, learn about the bill and sign our petition. Spread the word to friends, family and workplace associates to be heard in support of all the people that the social work profession strives to help on a daily basis.

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett wrote an op-ed in The New York Times on Monday, describing how the wealthiest Americans have been “leaving the middle class in the dust.” Buffett suggested that a minimum tax rate of 30 percent should be enacted on Americans making more than $1 million each year.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
Buffett’s comments come as Congress prepares to address the Bush tax cuts, which are set to expire for all Americans on Jan. 1. His argument that the wealthiest Americans should pay higher taxes is embraced by many pundits, politicians and citizens who claim that the rich are not contributing enough federal revenue, especially during the nation’s current economic downturn. Though Congress must raise tax rates for the wealthiest Americans from a practical, fiscal standpoint, it’s wrong to assume this is justified because they do not pay their fair share of taxes.
America’s top earners already contribute almost the total amount of federal income revenue. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 20 percent of Americans carry 67.9 percent of the federal tax burden. And about 40 percent of these taxes are paid by the top 1 percent alone.
In contrast, the bottom 47 percent of U.S. households pay no federal income taxes, as documented last year by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. If anything, this broad overview of America’s tax system implies that the rich are paying too much — a talking point that has certainly become popular with conservative pundits.
But the truth is that America’s wealthy have been able to make increasing financial gains despite carrying an ever-larger share of the country’s total tax burden. The Wall Street Journal used data from the Tax Foundation to show that, during the last decade, the top 1 percent’s share of income grew nearly five times faster than their share of taxes paid. To be fair, the wealthy are carrying federal income taxes at the highest percentage in years — The Wall Street Journal reported last year that the top 1 percent of earners now pay double the share of the tax burden that they paid in 1980. But new loopholes have made it easier for the very wealthy to skirt the system — especially the ability to classify income as “carried interest,” which effectively taxes earnings at a low 15 percent capital gains rate.
The fact that wealthy Americans take advantage of these tax deductions is not directly unfair, as these options are available to all U.S. citizens. The payoff, however, is much higher for wealthy citizens because of the drastic difference in tax rates.
Those who argue vehemently against higher taxes on the wealthy frequently push for a flat tax, under which every American will be taxed at the same rate, but the rich pay more because they earn higher incomes. A flat tax seems superficially simple and beneficial, but unfortunately would force the tax rate to be unsustainably low. After all, a family of four with a total annual income of $40,000 can’t afford to even pay $8,000 in taxes with a 20 percent flat tax. But if that flat rate is any lower, the rich will be getting the exact same break they currently enjoy with “carried interest” capital gains tax rates. For Congress to adopt a flat tax rate would be fiscally irresponsible.
Percentage wise, the rich are certainly paying their fair share. They can afford, however, to contribute more, and, in these dire economic times, they must. America’s deficit is more than $16 trillion and states are in dire need of fiscal aid. Washington should pursue a multi-level strategy to increase federal income through increased taxes and an overhaul of loopholes and superfluous tax credits.
And students should lobby for this. People often disregard students’ arguments for higher tax rates on the wealthy because of our limited work experience. For their points to be taken seriously, students should avoid the misguided argument that “the rich don’t pay their fair share.” America doesn’t need to penalize the wealthy — it needs to ask them for help.

The problem is, “rich” is considered income above $250,000. While $250,000 might seem like a lot on paper, think about the average family of four (yes, I admit that assumption is hetero-normative and that not all families look like that nowadays).
Think about your USC tuition, which is something we can all relate to. Cost of attendance here is upwards of $40,000 and for most people student loans and other financial aid doesn’t cover it completely. I know we make sacrifices for our education, as do many of our parents. After state and local taxes, federal taxes, and other things that come with the cost of living, $250,000 doesn’t stretch so far anymore. Once you have all those taxes, tuition is much harder to pay.
Then come the collateral side effects. Once you account for all those taxes and other costs, it becomes harder to pay things like mortgages and car loans. That family of four will cut out “frills” such as going out to dinner, which would hurt the local restaurants in their city. Maybe it won’t replace household appliances, which would hurt the local stores. Maybe it can no longer afford tutoring for their child struggling in math.
So while the “tax the rich” philosophy is all well and good, think about what actually happens and where that money really goes.
Not to mention the number is entirely arbitrary. As was mentioned below, no one deserves to pay more just because the government can’t control its spending problem. They got us into this mess with all these sweeping initiatives at once, some of which are ok, but refuse to accept responsibility for their spending.
To all those yelling “tax the rich” with their torches and pitchforks, would you want yourself to be taxed more, whether rich or not, just because the yahoos running the budget can’t manage it properly?
It’s impractical to advocate for no new taxes on the wealthy, because Obama has centered his whole 2nd term around carrying out a promise he believes got him a 2nd term.  Obama is shrewd to understand he won’t overcome Republican objectionism if revenue increases aren’t more than matched by cost cuts. Even though Obama’s a liberal and added to the social safety net with Obamacare, it’s clear he’s seen the numbers and knows entitlement programs must face some major cuts. Conservatives will hurt their 2014 and 2016 chances if they fight new taxes on the richest Americans. It’s quite remarkable to see how some enlightened Republicans are even backing out of their Norquist pledges (which should be illegal anyway, it amounts to bribery of public officials a jailable offense).  So the best thing for Conservatives to do is aim for the highest possible ratio of spending cuts to revenue increases, and to push for true reforms in tax administration, entitlement programs, and overall government bureaucracy.  That’s where bipartisan compromise can be achieved.
Hogwash.  The USA, like California, has a spending problem, not a revenue problem.  Cut spending and address waste, fraud and abuse FIRST.  The politicians are dreadful stewards of our money.  They spend recklessly, well beyond their means, when the money runs out and they have no more money to flush down the drain they declare a fiscal crisis and demand that those who make the most bail them out.  When the government demonstrates it knows how to handle money, then we can talk about raising taxes.  But even if they tax 100% of the wealthy’s money, it would be drop in the bucket compared to the deficit and the debt.  The idea that the problem is the wealthy not paying enough in taxes while ignoring the reckless spending and the cost of the out of control entitlements, etc. is a joke.
Thank you! Very well said. It’s so much easier to spend everyone else’s money. Now we’re deep in debt for spending too much on too many programs without accountability. This was always unsustainable, and attacking the “wealthy” is just a red herring.
I think we should take a wait-and-see approach to our country’s debt crisis.  Let’s all follow Obama the Great to the Coliseum and watch the lions massacre a former hegemon, Greece.  Like all great empires, we too will turn a blind eye to history and repeat the same mistakes.  Hint: higher taxes are not the answer.
High taxes do not harm the rich. High taxes harm people that aspire to be rich. The high taxes are a barrier to wealth accumulation. High taxes keep the poor from rising to the middle.
Incrasing taxes only causes those in government to spend morre, not spend less. The problem is not that the rich dont pay their fair share, they certainky do and pay more. The issue is the out of control spending that is occuring in govnment today. There must be entitlement program reform. There must be a complete overhaul of the tax code to close some loopholes, but the point you make twhat the rich mus pay more is absurd.
You fail to mention tha tthe  47% who dont pay any taxes are the folks reeceiving all the benefits from those who do pay the taxes. There is something wrong with that picture.
Carried Interest? What the heck is that, another phrase at mis directs folks away from the fact that unearned income or interest income is momey earned on savings accts, investments and such. This is money that has already been taxes at the corporate rate of 35%, plus the 15% unearned income tax rate, so that makes for aeffective 50% tax rate on that $1 earned. Are you seriously stating that you ae for a 50% tax rate on this income? 
The fools in Washington are banking on the American public being fools themselves for allowing th out of control spending to continue and to raise taxes in order to fund more spending.  You do not hear froObama, Pelosi, Reid, the Dem in the House and Senate talking about fiscal responsibility, educing spending and getting the budget under  control. It is not the Dem party platform. 
You kids are being snookered into giving away more of your income to today’s government, a goverment not of the people, not for the people, not by the people, but a government for themselves.
You must remember this… When the goverment taxes you more in order to spread the wealth, pay for more programs without spending reduction programs in place, in order for the rich to pay their fair share, etc….. You will soon find that the definition of rich starts dropping into your middle american incomes.  Who determines wha tis rich these days? That definitiocertianly has xhanged over the past 10 yrs, let alone 30 yrs ago!
If you fall into ts trap, it will be decades before anyone mit be able to get us out of the spend, spend, spend attitude of government.
You might want to rethink your political approach from taxing more, to spending less. That’s the only way the USA will ever get back on its feet, otherwise, Obama and his minions will spend us into complete financial chaos, and you kids, will forever be known as the Debt Generation, as it will be you who will have to deal withi this mess as you move on into the real life after college.
Good luck.
Yes taxes on the wealthy must go up.  But if they went to 100% it would not come closing the deficit gap.  Taxes on the middle class are going to have to go up–considerably.   And/or expenditures are going to have to be cut–considerably.  However, with a larger and larger share of expenditures going to pay interest on the debt and non-discretionary items, cutting expenditures becomes even more difficult.  The government can deflate the money (which it is doing) and make paying those debts easier.

Time to wake up and do your research.  The feel good tax the rich mantra feels good, but it does not work in the real world.

Reports of a shooting on Monday night led the Dept. of Public Safety to send two Trojans Alerts to the USC community.
One alerted students, faculty and staff to an alleged shooting near Exposition Boulevard, and the second said that early reports were unfounded and the area was safe.
According to DPS Capt. David Carlisle, a DPS officer was on a routine patrol on Exposition Boulevard near Exposition Park when he heard what sounded like a gunshot. He then saw a man who thought someone driving by had shot at him, and identified the vehicle as a white Toyota truck with a camper shell.
The man also alleged that three Hispanic males were in the car.
Carlisle said that the department decided to send out a Trojans Alert immediately to keep students in the loop.
“At the time, we thought safety of the students first, let’s ensure the safety of the area by sending out a Trojans Alert,” Carlisle said.
After DPS officers began investigating the area, however, they realized no gunshots had occurred and identified the source of the noise as a car backfiring.
Despite the inaccuracy of the initial alert, some students said they were pleased with the way DPS handled the reports of the shooting.
“It frustrates me that the incident was in fact unfounded, but that being said, it didn’t cause me any major inconvenience,” Matt Cheung, a freshman majoring in communication, said. “I’m glad that DPS is taking the approach of Trojans being safe rather than sorry.”
Other students, however, like Brianna Pak, a freshman majoring in industrial systems engineering, said they weren’t so happy with the way DPS handled the incident.
“I understand that DPS is trying to be safe as opposed to sorry, but I think they should verify their facts before they talk to students,” she said. “I mean, how do you not know if there was or wasn’t a shooting? It causes unnecessary fear and delegitimizes their alerts in the case of a real emergency.”
Though DPS aims to be accurate and quick with Trojans Alerts, Carlisle said the department would rather err on the side of caution.
“The bottom line is a man mistakenly thought a noise was a gunshot, and we sent out a Trojans Alert just to be safe,” Carlisle said.
Twan is just another race baiting angry black male
I agree with Rodney. As a Black student at USC, that comment was not only uncalled for, but sets us back in addition to the advances and contributions we have made as students. Grow up Twan.
Hmm, no young black males involved so it must be “unfounded”
Now some pretentious “white student” is going to call me a racist for merely pointing out the facts
Who gonna be first?
“Unfounded” means that no shooting actually occurred. A car backfired.
So you would rather that there actually was a shooting just so it can prove your point that young black males aren’t the only ones who shoot?
That’s disgusting.
I don’t know about racist, but as a black individual myself, stupid is the word.
