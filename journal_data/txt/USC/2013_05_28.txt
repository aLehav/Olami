By the start of fall semester, 56 current construction projects will be complete — just 15 percent of the 358 projects currently underway on and off campus, Associate Vice President of Capital Construction John Harmer said.

Among these projects are the construction of the new Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism on Childs Way next to the USC bookstore, new auditorium chairs for the Norris Cinema Theater and a maintenance upgrade on Grace Ford Salvatori Hall.
Until then, however, the construction has made it difficult for students and faculty to navigate campus and distracted students during academic sessions.
Qahir Popat, a rising senior majoring in economics, finds that construction noises make it difficult for him to participate in class.
“It’s really annoying at 9 a.m. when they are doing hardcore drilling outside the classroom and I can’t hear or concentrate,” Popat said.
Sarell Diamond, a rising junior majoring in communication, echoed that sentiment.
“It’s pretty distracting when the professors are constantly interrupted by loud drilling and truck traffic outside the lecture hall,” Diamond said.
The construction projects have also blocked many campus streets and sidewalks, forcing those who need access to certain buildings to find alternative routes.
“I have to take a long route to class because the main parts of campus are blocked off,” Diamond said. “Also, riding my bike is a little dangerous, as there are construction workers and trucks scattered all around campus.”
Harmer said USC construction projects are planned with these issues in mind.
“Long before any construction commences, we plan for the best possible approaches to minimize the impact to students, faculty, staff and visitors,” Harmer said. “In planning for construction, attention is given to the location of fences, barricades, pedestrian and vehicular routes and methods developed to reduce noise and disruption, including performing construction activities in off hours or weekends. Any concern is treated seriously and dealt with as a matter of urgency.”
 
Rising senior Matt Arkfeld, an East Asian area studies major, thinks that the short-term annoyances are part of life on a constantly evolving campus.
“All the construction projects are worth it to help better the school because they are long-term improvements,” Arkfeld said.

The State of California and USC will conduct public forums this week to gauge support for a leasing agreement that would grant the University about 70 percent of the California Science Center’s parking spaces for 25 events every year.
On May 30 and June 1, attendees can provide input on the potential lease’s latest terms.
Chariots · Disagreements over the rights of parking spaces has kept USC from being the official lease holders of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. A forum for the public will be held later this week. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission and USC agreed to terms of a lease on May 14, 2012. The lease would put the stadium under USC’s control until 2054, provided USC makes significant renovations, totaling between $70 million and $100 million. Since then, USC has been in talks with the state to finalize the agreement.
“We look forward to restoring the Coliseum to its former glory and ensuring its viability for many generations to come,” Senior Vice President Tom Sayles said in a statement to USC News after reaching the May 2012 agreement. “We believe this agreement will once again make the Coliseum a proud landmark and gathering place for all Angelenos.”
Although both sides are generally supportive of the lease thus far, the state must approve certain aspects of the lease, specifically the dispute over ownership of the parking lots in Exposition Park.
“We are still in discussions with the state on several aspects of the lease,” Sayles said in a statement. “We support public disclosure and discussion of all terms before any lease is approved, and we are hopeful of reaching an agreement that works for everyone.”
Some of the lease’s current opponents say this parking agreement would hurt the California Science Center and California African American Museum, because those sites would lose more than 1,400 parking spaces on Coliseum event days.
Dimiana Saad, a rising senior majoring in psychology, said leasing the stadium is a natural next step for the university.
“I honestly never knew that the Coliseum wasn’t owned by USC,” Saad said. “When I attended the Electric Daisy Carnival in 2010 [at the stadium] after committing to become a Trojan, I remember feeling as though I was already on campus. Since football is treated like a religion at our school, it only feels right that we have official ownership over the Coliseum.”
These renovations will be paid for in part by a $5 hike on ticket prices for the 2013 USC football season.
Meagan Hauser, a rising senior majoring in communication, thinks that the $5 price raise is worth it.
“I am totally supportive of USC leasing the Coliseum,” Hauser said. “While the stadium is historic, it is really rundown and in need of restoration.”
Others hope that the stadium is not just a glorified temple for USC’s most treasured sports team. Jake Curry, a ’13 alumnus who majored in health promotion and disease prevention, wants USC to use this opportunity for community involvement.
“I think that [USC] should focus on incorporating local communities with cultural events along with the bigger events,” Curry said. “That way, it can increase not only money but also help us get more involved with the community around us.”
The decision by the state could take as long as a year, but the public will have multiple chances before then to voice their opinions. Comments be submitted to ExpoParkProposalComments@scsa.ca.gov, and the public can attend forums on May 30 at the California African American Museum at 6 p.m. and June 1 at the California Science Center at 10 a.m. The California Science Center Board of Directors will vote on the agreement June 5.

Denzil Suite, USC’s associate vice president for Student Affairs, will serve as the University of Washington Vice President for Student Life starting July 29, pending approval from the university’s board of regents, UW announced May 23.
Movin’ on · USC associate vice president for Student Affairs Denzil Suite wil start at the University of Washington on July 29. – Photo courtesy of USC
This follows Michael L. Jackson, USC’s vice president for Student Affairs for nearly two decades, February announcement that he would retire. Suite has held the No. 2 position under Jackson.
Student Affairs includes departments ranging from Student Publications, which oversees the Daily Trojan, to Greek Life, as well as the Office for International Students, El Centro Chicano, the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs and the Asian Pacific American Student Services.
The Provost’s Office will make several structural changes to Student Affairs effective for 2013-14, following a yearlong review.
Suite, who holds a Ph.D. in Policy and Organization from USC, has worked at USC since 2003, and served as associate dean of Student Affairs from 2000 to 2001. He served as dean for Student Affairs at UC Santa Cruz between 2001 and 2003 and has also worked at the Student Affairs departments at Berkeley and UCLA.
“When I got [to Santa Cruz], I was very enthusiastic … but USC recruited me back with a better position,” Suite said. “This isn’t the same situation. I’m planning on putting my roots down in Seattle.”
Suite spoke of his desire to move on and lead UW’s student affairs department and helping students on campus.
“Every person I met [at UW] really made me feel like I belong,” Suite said. “It’s very bittersweet because I’m a Trojan and I’ve loved my time here, but I’ll be a Huskie now.”
Suite’s annual salary at UW will be $250,000, according to a statement from the university.
“The people here are wonderful and I’ve loved my time at USC,” Suite said. “I’ll certainly miss the students, the faculty, the staff, the campus … and the ability to golf year-round.”
Too bad. Our loss. I liked this guy cuz he really
listened to you with his eyes and his ears, no matter
if you were white. He didn’t have the boring, predictable,
angry, victim-type, intimidating Attitude that you find here in LA.
Our best to him.
This is UNREAL!  I can’t believe USC would let you go….so sad.  You are the best and UW is super lucky to have you!!!!!
Max and Beth should be impeached.

Following last week’s end to their four-year championship run in a narrow 4-3 defeat to the fifth-ranked Ohio State Buckeyes, all four of the USC singles players who qualified for the NCAA singles championship were knocked out by the end of the round of 16 in Urbana, Ill., wrapping up the team’s 2013 campaign.
In the individual championship, juniors Emilio Gomez and Ray Sarmiento and sophomores Yannick Hanfmann and Roberto Quiroz all qualified. Gomez picked up a No. 7 seed, while Sarmiento scored a 9-16 seed. Hanfmann and Quiroz both received at-large bids.
Although Gomez was seeded highest, being the Pac-12’s automatic qualifier, he was the first to fall, to Alabama’s Jarryd Botha 6-7, 6-3, 7-5 in the first round.
Gomez’s loss came after he reached the round of 16 last year and held a 22-6 overall singles record during the season. He had his highest career singles ranking this season, sitting as high as No. 2 during the year. That seeding secured his spot as an Intercollegiate Tennis Association All-American for the first time in his Trojan career.
Sarmiento, Hanfmann and Quiroz won their first round matches in straight sets over singles from VCU, Boise State and Oklahoma, advancing to the round of 32. It would be a milestone for Hanfmann, as he registered the first NCAA singles victory of his career.
In the round of 32, Sarmiento overcame Notre Dame’s Greg Andrews in a back-and-forth match 7-5, 1-6, 6-4 to advance to the round of 16. Hanfmann also advanced, defeating the 9-16-seeded Matija Pecotic from Princeton in straight sets 6-4, 6-1. Quiroz was the lone Trojan to fall in the round, losing to South Carolina’s Tsvetan Mihov in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3. Quiroz finished his sophomore season with a 38-11 overall singles record, making him team leader in singles wins on the season.
But both advancing Trojans were knocked out by their opponents in the round of 16.
After posting his first two career wins in NCAA singles competition, Hanfmann would fall to Auburn’s Andreas Miles, who advanced to the quarterfinals by defeating Hanfmann in straight sets 6-3, 6-2. Hanfmann ended his sophomore season with an overall singles record of 31-7, while also achieving ITA All-American status.
Sarmiento got a tough draw in the round of 16, paired with No. 3-seeded Jarmere Jenkins of newly crowned NCAA champion Virginia. Sarmiento fought to pull off the upset, though, losing the first set in a close tiebreaker and winning the second. The final set went back and forth with the pair tied at 4-4. But Jenkins dug in, holding serve and getting a break to fend off Sarmiento and win by a score of 7-6, 2-6, 6-4. Sarmiento closed his junior season with a 27-9 overall singles record and also finished as an All-American. Another milestone for Sarmiento was his 100th career singles win with his victory in the NCAA Round of 64.
This marked the exit of all USC men’s singles players from the NCAA singles competition, and thus the end of the USC men’s tennis team’s 2013 season. As a team, the Trojans finished the season 26-5 overall, and their quest for a fifth-straight NCAA championship was halted in the NCAA quarterfinals by Ohio State.
The team now enters their offseason in order to prepare for the 2014 season.

It might seem like a bit of a stretch to suggest that the No. 2 doubles pairing of junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria entered the NCAA Women’s Doubles Championship in Urbana, Ill., with something to prove. After all, the duo already boasted an ITA/Riviera All-American doubles title and consecutive Pac-12 and ITA National Indoor doubles crowns.
Triple Crown · Kaitlyn Christian and Sabrina Santamaria won the ITA All-American, ITA National Indoors and NCAA Tournament this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
But the decorated tandem also experienced its share of adversity this year, faltering in the opening round of the 2012 NCAA doubles tournament and suffering an upset loss last week to Stanford’s No. 8 team of Kristie Ahn and Nicole Gibbs, which became the tipping point in a tightly contested match that jettisoned the Women of Troy from the NCAA tournament’s Round of 16.
Christian and Santamaria, who have already accomplished a great deal in their two years playing together with still another season left, shrugged off these disappointments to lay claim to a feat never accomplished by a pair of USC teammates: a NCAA women’s doubles championship. The second-year partners capped off their incredible run — one in which they did not surrender a single set — with a 6-4, 6-3 victory over UCLA’s Skylar Morton and Robin Anderson after defeating teams from Northwestern, Oklahoma State, Illinois and Tennessee in previous rounds.
“We finished tough last year with a first-round loss [at the NCAAs],” Christian said. “We came into the season just staying really positive with each other, and after we won All-Americans we just kept rolling and were really having a lot of fun on the tennis court.”
The title match pitted Christian and Santamaria against a familiar foe in Morton and Anderson. The pairs last faced each other in October during the ITA/Riviera All-American semifinals — a match in which the Women of Troy emerged victorious. But before that, the two teams could not have been more evenly matched, as the pairs each won three of their six matches in 2011-12.
“They’re definitely a respectable team, one of the best in the country, and we knew that they were gunning for us,” Santamaria said of Morton and Anderson. “We knew it was going to be a really great match. We knew that if we just stayed solid and positive with each other, then the outcome would take care of itself.”
Christian and Santamaria finished their second season together with a 37-1 overall record, which puts them among the most dominant collegiate doubles seasons of all time. Even after claiming the rare collegiate “Triple Crown” of winning the ITA All-American, the ITA National Indoors and the NCAA tournament, the duo is not yet finished. The NCAA championship victory clinched the pair a wildcard berth into this summer’s U.S. Open.
“I just feel blessed to have the best doubles partner in the world, the best doubles player in the country by my side,” Santamaria said of Christian. “She’s amazing so, honestly, I’m so blessed to be right next to her and go to the U.S. Open.”

Twenty.
That’s how many wins the USC baseball team finished their season with, after being swept by Arizona to end their season over the weekend, the least by any Trojan squad since 1957. That team was 18-4.
Veteran · Junior infielder James Roberts went 2-4 with a double in USC’s final game — a 7-1 loss to Arizona. A steadying presence in the middle of the lineup, Roberts hit .320 this season with a team-leading four home runs. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
So needless to say, this could be considered another throwaway season for USC baseball, their eighth straight without a winning record. From the time USC joined a conference in 1927 until their last winning season in 2005, the Trojans had eight total seasons without a winning record.
There was no remarkably bad stretch of play in 2013, such as when the Trojans went 1-15 to close out the season last year. USC’s longest losing streak was five games, experienced on two occasions throughout the season. They were only swept in weekend series three times, but actually won four series of their own.
What there was was youth, and lots of it.
Youth manifests itself in many ways on a baseball field, as any member of the 2013 Trojans (with 16 true freshmen on their roster — roughly half the team) could tell you. But there is probably no bigger sign of youth than impatience.
“We were really, really young,” USC coach Dan Hubbs said. “We lost a lot of close games. We struggled to close out games. We struggled to get the big hit.”
And there is plenty of hard evidence to back that claim for these 2013 Trojans. USC tied for last in the Pac-12 in walks taken with 132. Conference champion Oregon State took 236, while UCLA led the conference with 249. Coveted bases-on-balls come only with having the experience and the confidence at the plate to wait for the right pitch to hit, and to simply not swing and take base if that pitch doesn’t come.
One look at USC’s stats will back that up. Only four Trojans finished with more than 10 walks on the year; three were upperclassman, and the lone sophomore — catcher Garrett Stubbs — has started almost every game in his two years with the program.
On the mound, walks reflect the inexperience as well. USC issued 241 free passes this year, 35 more than next-worst Arizona State and 99 more than the aforementioned champion Beavers.
“We knew this year was going to be a struggle,” Hubbs said. “We had our ups and downs and inconsistency, but the program will be better off for it.”
The youth did show promise, and a good bit of it too. And for that, Hubbs understandably would not call this season a “throwaway.” The Trojans will lose only two starters next year (although it could be three if junior third baseman James Roberts decides to sign with a professional team). On the mound, they lose just one relief pitcher and return the entire starting rotation, all of who made great strides throughout the year.
“There’s a lot to be excited about, especially with our starting pitching,” Hubbs said. “We showed a lot of promise there.”
So while it will be a very similar Trojan roster that takes to Dedeaux Field next spring, it will be a very different Trojan team. Four current freshmen — shortstop Blake Lacey, outfielders Bobby Stahel and Timmy Robinson and pitcher Kyle Twomey — will all have a year’s experience as starters under their belt. The weekend rotation is in good hands with the likes of Twomey, current sophomore Wyatt Strahan and current junior Bob Wheatley, with the latter two finishing the year with sub-2.80 ERAs.
“The culture of this program is changing,” Hubbs said, echoing the comments made by players throughout the year. “Guys are working extra on their own now. The kids have bought into the work ethic. It’s 35 guys invested in winning. And with another year’s experience and comfort, we’re gonna see a difference.”
The big question will be the bullpen. Six true freshman saw significant action out of the ’pen this year, with tremendously varying results. All dazzled at times, and all had their fair share of forgettable outings. Hubbs once memorably likened picking relievers to “flipping a coin” because there was simply no way to know who would have it on any given day. Next year, Hubbs wants to have a set group of a few core guys out of the bullpen — five or less, ideally, as is commonplace with the Pac-12’s top teams.
It’s clear that Hubbs isn’t concerned about the Trojans’ disappointing play this year, and expects a dramatic improvement from his team next year.
“Let’s say we win 23 games (instead of 20), well, we’re still not in the postseason,” Hubbs said. “We need to focus on what we need to do to make this program viable again long term. If we look like this next year, then it’s a lost season.”

After missing the NCAA title by one stroke apiece in two of the last three seasons, the USC women’s golf team ensured the same would not happen in 2013. The squad posted the low score in each round of the NCAA championship tournament — a feat that has not happened since the tournament began in 1982 — en route to an NCAA record 19-under-par finish and the national championship.
Wunderkind · Freshman Annie Park claimed USC’s fourth individual NCAA title with her 10-under-par score at the 2013 NCAA Women’s Golf Championships at the University of Georgia G.C. in Athens, Ga. Park was also named 2013 WGCA Player of the Year. – Courtesy of USC Sports Information
USC freshman Annie Park dominated on the course, capturing the individual crown with a finish at 10-under. She is just the seventh freshman to win an individual title at the NCAA tournament, and the fourth Trojan to do so in tournament history.
Park, a first-year player from Levittown, N.Y., was aware of the pressure on her as a freshman but not phased by it.
“College tournaments are different than junior tournaments,” Park said. “I’ve known that since my first collegiate tournament. Over the semester I’ve improved a lot with the help of the coaches and the trainers — a lot more than I expected.”
Park was also named player and freshman of the year by the Women’s Golf Coaches Association, capping off a dream season that included the individual NCAA title and helping the Women of Troy capture seven consecutive top-five tournament finishes, including the NCAA West Regional and the Pac-12 championship.
Major factors in Park’s road to victory at the NCAA tournament were the commanding lead she established early and her nerves of steel in the final round. Though not every hole was a complete success — Park went bogey, double bogey, bogey on holes 15 through 17 — she kept her composure and matched bogey for birdie to finish 10 strokes under par, six strokes ahead of the second-place finisher.
“I just tried to focus on each shot, focus on the present and not look too far ahead,” Park said. “The course was not an easy golf course. I think I had an advantage because I hit far off the tee; on par fives I was able to reach the green when others had to use wedges to get onto the green.”
Of course, the NCAA team title would not be possible with a strong effort from only one player. The rest of the Trojan squad stepped up in a big way, with all five competitors finishing in the top 20. Freshman Kyung Kim and junior Sophia Popov tied for sixth place at 1-over, sophomore Doris Chen placed 15th at 4-over and junior Rachel Morris finished 17th at 5-over.
While senior leadership is a key aspect of most teams, the Women of Troy are a very young team that build one another up regardless of the situation.
“All of us get along well,” Park said of her teammates. “We’re so close on and off the course, we try to help one another. We play together, eat together and hang out together outside of campus. We know we need to play our best for the team score.”
With such a young team, USC figures to be a contender both next year and in the years to follow. All of the participants in the 2013 NCAA tournament will return for the 2014 season, and fresh faces will join the team in hopes of adding to the legacy this year’s squad established.
“We’re going to try to do what we’ve done this semester each day, each tournament, each shot,” Park said. “We’ll have two new top-ranked freshman and we know we’ll be good for the next few years.”
The win in this year’s tournament marks program’s third national championship, all of which occurred under head coach Andrea Gaston. More broadly, the USC women’s golf championship became the 98th national championship in USC’s history as USC continues the journey to the three-digit mark in the 2013-14 school year.
 
They were always in the hunt but somewhat never used to make it at the end moment. But this time all their talent and efforts have paid and here they are. Congratulations to everyone. It is great to see female golfers emerging everywhere.

Put the snacks within arm’s reach and claim the comfiest armchair in the house, because this summer brings a blazing hot season of TV. This summer’s lineup looks promising for both returning shows and debuts, providing plenty of excuses to tune in and veg out after days in the sun.
How much is enough? · Skylar (Anna Gunn) and Walter White (Bryan Cranston) will return to conclude the fifth and final season of Breaking Bad beginning August 11.

72 Hours 
Thursday, June 6 — 9 p.m. — TNT
This new TNT survival drama features nine contestants who are helicoptered into the wilderness with bottles of water and GPSes. Their mission, given by host Brandon Johnson, is to find a briefcase with $100,000 in 72 hours. Battling the dangers of exposure, maneuvering through unforgiving land and fighting to cooperate with group members, the three teams’ goal is to make it out alive. Since the reality TV “adventure race” concept is hardly new to television, the real survival drama might come from 72 Hours’ fight to offer a fresh enough take on a stale formula to survive the summer.
Graceland
Thursday, June 6 — 10 p.m. — USA
Based on a true story, the series focuses on Mike Warren (Aaron Tveit), a new FBI agent reassigned from a job in DC to an undercover assignment in Graceland, a Southern California beach house where a handful of young undercover agents from various law enforcement organizations also reside. With sarcastic, witty senior FBI agent Paul Briggs (Daniel Sunjata) as a mentor, Warren appears to be in good hands. But Warren’s deadly undercover assignments perilously thrust him into the world of the Mexican Federal Police. Drug-busts and near death experiences hurtle toward the rookie at full force in Jeff Eastin’s crime drama. For fans of the genre, or even of Brandon Jay McLaren, Graceland looks like a definite must-see this summer.
Pretty Little Liars 
Tuesday, June 11 — 8 p.m. — ABC Family
Season four of the Pretty Little Liars series brings even more danger and lies. The four best friends are back to battle against “A,” risking the lives of their loved ones as well as their own. Is it even possible to have another season of drama and terror? For Aria (Lucy Hale), Spencer (Troian Bellisario), Emily (Shay Mitchell), and Hanna (Ashley Benson), it seems that thrill and near-death experiences are limitless, especially since a fifth season is already on the horizon.
Under the Dome 
Monday, June 24 — 10 p.m. — CBS
In Chester’s Mill, Maine, the tightly knit small-town community is about to get a little too close. This story focuses on a town’s struggles after a large, clear dome appears out of nowhere, encasing the town like a bubble. The police and military desperately attempt to save the trapped citizens from the mysterious dome; however, such law enforcement is unable to help quell the violence and chaos that has broken out within the dome’s confines. Those caught “Under the Dome” will have to fend for themselves in this sci-fi drama adapted from the Stephen King novel of the same name.

Breaking Bad 
Sunday, August 11 — 9 p.m. — AMC

Now that the end has come, will all secrets be revealed? Will White’s penance for his sins involve the sacrifice of the family he holds so dear? The breathlessly anticipated finale for Vince Gilligan’s crime drama is sure to tie up loose ends in explosive fashion.

For those staying on campus for the summer holiday, a brief respite from the pressures of summer internships and extra courses is just a drive down Interstate 5. Orange County, California is the perfect destination for those looking for a weekend off, or even a day trip to try some of the best food Southern California has to offer.
A hamburger a day · Burger Parlor offers some of the best burgers in Southern California including the bacon-happy “Smokey,” pictured above. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
If you’re tired of the Los Angeles smog this summer, map out a Metro Rail route or hop in the car and give the Orange County experience a go and it won’t disappoint as long, as you’re willing to commit your time and tastebuds.
Breakfast at Bruxie 
A treasure of Orange County eateries and a go-to for students at nearby Chapman University, Bruxie is nestled in the heart of Old Towne, Orange. To start the perfect OC day, grab a fluffy liege waffle kissed by powdered sugar and pair it with signature chocolate sauce. For those more inclined to a savory waffle, Bruxie offers a mushroom, goat cheese and arugula waffle that marries all the flavors with a vibrantbalsamic vinegar. The combination sounds strange at first blush, but one bite will make even the most hardened carnivores believers in this vegetarian-friendly offering.
Bruxie’s waffles travel well, so take your order to go and discover Old Towne’s hidden gems on foot. You’ll stumble upon antique stores, thrift shops, rustic fountains and well-dressed locals. Most shops are small and quaint but host all kinds of knickknacks for curious eyes.
Parking can be troublesome, so keep trying for a spot in the nearby residential area. Friendly homeowners accustomed to eager visitors won’t shoo you away; plus, it gives you an opportunity to linger around the old-fashioned decor of colorful cottages and immaculate front yards.
 
Bruxie is located on 292 N Glassell Street in Orange, Calif. near Chapman University.
Five-Star Burgers Dress Down for Burger Parlor
Although not all of downtown Fullerton is as picturesque as Harbor Boulevard, the delicious sandwiches and fries sliding out of Burger Parlor’s kitchen make the drive worthwhile. Chef Joseph Mahon (formerly of Bastide fame) is at the helm of this unpretentious burger-lovers’ mecca. Order “numbers” are actually laminated cards of famous album covers, including Nirvana’s “Nevermind” and Dr. Dre’s “The Chronic.”
The star of the show is Mahon’s “Smokey,” a juicy tour de force of savory flavors which lives up to its namesake, topped with a perfectly crispy double helping of bacon.
If you’ve had enough beef in your life, satiate your lunchtime hunger with their specialty sandwich, the “Chickwich.” Its perfectly toasted bun, cheese, chipotle aioli, and well-grilled chicken breast will leave you smiling and reaching for napkins, because it can get a little messy.
While there are plenty of quaint shops and boutiques on Harbor for you to peruse after attaining burger nirvana, downtown Fullerton also has a farmers’ market Thursdays from 4 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. at the Fullerton Downtown Plaza. The market features live entertainment and activities beside a showcase of fresh produce. Downtown Fullerton also has vibrant nightlife in bars and clubs that draw crowds of students, artists and young professionals.
 
Burger Parlor is located on 204 N Harbor Blvd. in Fullerton, Calif., in the heart of downtown Fullerton.
Pizza Lounging in Laguna 
Top of the World Drive in Laguna Beach offers sweeping views of the crystal-clear coastline, spotless skies, and rolling hills. Sure, it sounds like a cheesy brochure for a timeshare property, but you really can’t go wrong with this location.
The surrounding town of Laguna also has wonderful places to dine, such as the Pizza Lounge, about 100 feet from the main beach. Each slice at this inexpensive and fast little eatery packs in quite a punch with the right ratio of toppings to sauce. If you’re not craving tomato sauce, try the chicken pesto pizza. The ingredients translate perfectly to Pizza Lounge’s thin yet substantive crust.
Better yet, take your pizza on the go and visit Top of the World Park, a favorite for lovers, adventurers and photographers. A smooth uphill drive past posh houses and one worthwhile hike later, Top of the World brings visitors great views of the city and is a great spot for an impromptu picnic.
 
Pizza Lounge is located at 397 South Coast Highway, in Laguna Beach, Calif. Top of the World Park is at 21601 Treetop Lane, Laguna Beach, Calif.
 
These are just a few ideas for what to do in Orange County, but the options are limitless. There are plenty of ways to escape the drudgery of internships in L.A. this summer, and a half-hour drive out of the bustle of L.A. is a great place to start.

The city of Cannes, France exudes glamour any day of the year. Its turquoise, yacht-laden waters, chic boutiques and infamously luxurious hotels mark the city as an indispensable stop along the French Riviera. But from May 15–26 this year, Cannes’ trademark opulence overflowed with Hollywood flair as celebrities, filmmakers and cinephiles descended from every corner of the globe to get a taste of exciting new films, directors and artistic trends in what has become the film industry’s compulsory annual pilgrimmage to the south of France. This year’s film offerings certainly didn’t disappoint.
Inside Llewyn Davis
The recipient of this year’s Grand Prix prize, Inside Llewyn Davis brings the Coen brothers back to the spotlight after the lukewarm reception of A Serious Man. The film traces the life of its eponymous protagonist, a young folk singer in the 1960s struggling to make ends meet as he navigates failed relationships and broken friendships in an effort to score an audition with a prominent record label manager.
Llewyn pushes past the Coens’ usual cartoonish and exaggerated characters to deliver writing and performances that are funny, accessible, charming and most importantly — human. Oscar Isaac brings Llewyn to life in such an unassuming and authentic way that one wonders whether the musician he plays might have actually existed among the myriad of talent that emerged from Greenwich Village in the 60s.
Likewise, the supporting characters uphold the Coens’ quirkiness without forgoing the story’s heart. While Carey Mulligan is the perfect levelheaded foil to Isaac’s airiness, John Goodman  plays an unforgettable aristocratic wanderer that emphasizes how losing one’s direction in life is a problem which affects everyone regardless of social standing.
The music in the film mystifies and uplifts and fans of folk will bask in its glow while non-believers will undoubtedly find themselves converted to music’s power. Ultimately the film offers a feel-good yet philosophical look at the life of a musician disguised as a feel-good flick.
Venus in Fur
With Venus in Fur, director Roman Polanski reasserts his talent for nuance and his mastery of illustrating on-screen power dynamics between characters.
If the 20-minute standing ovation he received at the Lumiere Theatre in Cannes is any indication, the film will shock, provoke and entertain for years to come.
Adapted from David Ives’ award-winning play of the same name, Venus in Fur depicts one night in a deserted theater in France. Exhausted from a day of disappointing auditions, writer-director Thomas (Mathieu Amalric) reluctantly allows Vanda, a last-minute arrival (Polanski’s wife Emmanuelle Seigner) to audition. While Thomas is exasperated with her flamboyance at first, he slowly finds himself charmed by her uncanny grasp of the role, embracing the play’s intricate exploration of sadomasochism in the 19th century.
Polanski directs with confidence and a theatricality that is never static or trite, infusing a simple two-character narrative with such an organic, gripping style that viewers can’t help but be enthralled. There are hints of Tim Burton in the cinematography and in Alexandre Desplat’s eccentric score, but ultimately Polanski makes the film his own, building on his natural propensity to surprise and amuse, this time within  a very basic set.
The film’s play with self-reflexivity, power struggles and role reversals will keep spectators wondering who is in control long after the closing credits, while the double entendres in every line of dialogue will doubtless generate equal parts confusion and laughter.
The cherry on top is Seigner’s performance, a tour de force exercise in acting that captures the mysterious nature of femininity with precision and beauty. She effortlessly alternates between cluelessness and authority, redefining the role of a femme fatale.
Nebraska
Blurring the line between comedy and drama is one of the festival’s few uplifting films, Nebraska. Beautifully written and paced, director Alexander Payne (Sideways) delivers his most personal and moving work yet.
Nebraska follows the antics of David (Will Forte) and his elderly father Woody (Bruce Dern) as they travel from Montana to Lincoln, Neb., to claim a seemingly bogus sweepstake prize Woody received in the mail.
Filmed in black-and-white (and notoriously difficult to fund as a result), Nebraska embodies elements of Napoleon Dynamite and The Last Picture Show by instilling humor into the ordinary and the everyday. The choice of black and white illustrates the dreariness of life even as it imbues the mundane landscape with a timeless beauty.
The performances are all top-notch, from Dern’s riveting portrayal to June Squibb’s heart-warming, hilarious and even shocking performance as his wife Kate. This is one film that can easily slip under the radar and unfortunately is likely do so due to its subject matter and artistic ambitions.
 
Cannes serves as a platform for showcasing the cutting edge in cinema as an art form and the best of this year’s offerings put particular emphasis onfleshing out the emotional depth of the human experience and translating into film. The efforts of major directors like Polanski and the Coen Brothers are an encouraging sign that such character-focused complexity will become a point of emphasis for films in the future.

Mayor-elect Eric Garcetti and mayoral candidate Wendy Greuel mastered the art of political mannerisms in this year’s mayoral race: The perfect on-camera smile. The presidential wave. The charming ad-libs during speeches and interviews.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
 
While Garcetti made history as the first Jewish mayor elected in Los Angeles, in a time when women make up such a paltry percentage of all political positions, a greater symbol of social justice would have been Greuel as mayor. In the end, Los Angeles should have elected its first female mayor — it would have been a beautiful sign of gender equality.
Though the two candidates wielded similarly impressive resumes of extensive government service and enviable academic endeavors, 42-year-old Garcetti nailed his win with an eight-point lead over Greuel. But the mayoral race barely energized the public to actually get out the vote — only 19 percent of eligible L.A. voters engaged in their civic duty this year.
Greuel might have left this race victorious if more voters recognized the significance of electing a female mayor in such an evenly matched race. But instead, less than a quarter of the eligible voting population decided our mayor would be yet another male.
Admittedly, Garcetti’s strategy, to play up his Latino heritage and mobilize very specific voter groups, led to his triumph. He also capitalized on Greuel’s weaknesses: He attacked her close alliances with the labor unions, questioned her candor in his advertisements and portrayed himself as the “independent” candidate — free from the stronghold of super PACs and corporations.
But unlike the presidential election, where a Republican and a Democrat with distinct visions for the nation fight before the American people, Garcetti and Greuel bickered over matters where they actually overlapped. Both candidates wanted to create more jobs. Both support benefits for same-sex partners. Ultimately, the election flatlined instead of picking up heat because there were few areas where they contrasted.
The public also saw how Garcetti and Greuel shared remarkable backgrounds: Garcetti worked as a councilman and Greuel as the city controller. They have each contributed to this city by adding programs. Garcetti introduced UNTAG to eradicate graffiti from neighborhoods, while Greuel made streets safer by adding more left-turn signals.
So if this is really the case — if Garcetti and Greuel are truly equal in skill and vision — we must question why Los Angeles failed to elect its first female mayor. We must question why this country still does not see many females in office even when they are clearly capable of fulfilling all given responsibilities. With Councilmember Jan Perry’s exit, there will be no female city councilmembers in the next term.
Certainly, Garcetti has the charisma and intelligence to run this city. But seeing Greuel in office would have been a lighthouse in an American landscape darkened by sexism and prejudice against women.
“I may not have been able to break through the glass ceiling last night, but you sure helped me put a crack in it and because of your work, the next woman candidate in my shoes will crash right through it,” Greuel said in her concession speech.
Unfortunately, the leadership of a woman might not occur if voters don’t see the importance of electing a woman. By having more women in strong leadership roles, children will not see only men in positions of power.
According to the Huffington Post, L.A. is the second-largest city in the country — a country that for some unfortunate reason ranks 79th in the world for political representation. Just imagine what Mayor Gruel could have done for the future of females in politics.
If the voters had recognized this significance and had been mobilized to cast their ballots, they would have made history for such an underrepresented gender.
 
Rini Sampath is a sophomore majoring in international relations global business.
It is flabbergasting how unapologetic some can be about completely disregarding the merits of candidates and then voting simply based on someone’s birth characteristics.  And then worse, encouraging others to do the same!
Just about the worst reason to make a political decision would be “it would have been a beautiful sign of gender equality.”  Forgive us if we prefer to vote for the person we believe would be the best candidate, rather than the person who looks different than the last few mayors.
Rini’s perspective is so superficial and focused on things other than the issues.  Thank God most voters have a more intelligent perspective.
“In the end, Los Angeles should have elected its first female mayor — it would have been a beautiful sign of gender equality.”
Electing someone because of their sex is precisely the kind of sexism we should avoid in politics. Supporting Gruel strictly because she is a woman “all else being equal” is bad logic.
Gruel assumed she had the “women’s vote” in the bag thanks to her own sex. She failed to account for Garcetti being able to sway women away from her by demonstrating himself to be a formidable candidate in his own right.
Moreover, the two candidates fundamentally has some differences. If you look more into the election, you’ll see that Gruel’s heavy use of union funds divided her sharply from Garcetti in addition to policy distinctions.
God help LA from all these idiots!
Unfortunately for you, the voters of L.A. looked deeper than just the candidates genders when casting their ballots.  The times are changing and even the democrat base is getting tired of union thugs using fear, coercion and bundles of money to buy them elections.  Wendy Gruel learned that the hard way and will be known as a union puppet for the rest of her life.  Not sold on Garcetti, but losing union support, which he tried to court initially, was the best break of his life.
This reporter’s logic doesn’t make sense and it insults females.  If Kim Kardashian was running for Mayor the article is somewhat stating that we should vote for her just because she’s a female!!!  If Los Angeles had strong, QUALIFIED women to run for Office then they would be voted in.  The fact that Garcetti was endorsed by the National Organization Women says  a lot.
i would have liked her to win as well.
Identity politics should win over content of character. It’s our duty to vote for whoever looks most like us because it’s symbolic, or something.
Los Angeles is ready to elect a womyn mayor but not this womyn. Gruel lacked chrisma and ran an awful campaign, ie., she spent all her money early on negative attack ads (she was the first candidate to go negative).  She also could not come back from the DWP salaries she was allowing to take place under her leadership and her partnership with DWP and labor unions.  She had everything right – money, endorsements, union support but she couldn’t get traction – not because of her gender but because she wasn’t a formidable candidate. Gender should not be the only deciding factor when voting. She is no Hillary and it showed.

As new details surrounding the IRS scandal come to light, it is clear that President Barack Obama’s administration has inappropriately handled the situation to a point where things have dragged on far too long. A special prosecutor should be appointed to efficiently resolve this debacle.
After the first audit reports were released this month, the American public has witnessed the type of targeting and firing that reeks of a political quagmire with the potential to hinder its day-to-day ability to accomplish its political goals.
Called upon by the House Oversight Committee to testify about the IRS’s activities, Director of IRS Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner read a prepared statement and then took the Fifth. In the wake of Lerner’s testimony, or lack thereof, special prosecutions ought to be used to find the responsible parties as soon as possible.
Lerner’s invocation of the Fifth Amendment was illegal and should have been inadmissible to the House Oversight Committee when she testified.
While taking the Fifth is meant to protect individuals under criminal investigation, it does not allow those individuals to pick and choose what questions they would like to answer under cross-examination. In fact, people testifying before Congress usually do not say a word before invoking it, making Lerner’s utilization all the more puzzling.
She first read a statement refuting any accusations of her involvement: “I have not done anything wrong. I have not broken any laws. I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other committee,” she said. She then refused to answer any further questions.
Almost immediately afterward, Lerner was placed on administrative leave by the IRS, however, this was only after she refused to resign. Her testimony, combined with these developments, makes Lerner out to be a possible scapegoat for this scandal. Blame for the situation has fallen mostly on Lerner and the IRS, but this does not eliminate the notion that other individuals in the government are overstepping their power and their obligations to the public.
Because federal law allows Lerner to garner pay and benefits as a result of her placement on administrative leave, the government is obliged to put an end to this circus as soon as possible. The Obama administration also has an interest in putting an end to growing speculation stemming from the four simultaneous congressional investigations.
To achieve this a special prosecutor ought to be appointed. This would put someone who is beyond the political intrigue in a position to swiftly find the person or persons culpable. However, a major obstacle to this is the resistance of those investigations to such an appointment. Other legislators, such as Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., say that there is not enough evidence and yet, how much more do they need? Lerner’s suspicious testimony illustrates that there is more to the story than we know.
If a special prosecutor is finally appointed to investigate the IRS’s Tea Party organization targeting, then the story might lose its staying power, and the administration will be able to move on and pass legitimate legislation, such as immigration reform. One can only hope that those in positions of oversight will be able to act so quickly. It’s time to move on from this scandal and focus on tackling the country’s more pressing issues.

The IRS is an affront to privacy and liberty. Accounts can be frozen with just a  phone call or letter – no court, no witnesses, no jury. The penalties for IRS employees revealing one’s private financial dealings are woefully lax. Does anyone at the IRS lose their job or pay penalties for abusing people? If the law is 80,000+ pages can anyone really be in compliance?
There is only one income tax that is fair – 0% for all! Maximum privacy. Minimum hassle.
