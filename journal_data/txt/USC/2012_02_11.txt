The university appointed Craig Keys to be associate senior vice president for civic engagement this week. He will report to Senior Vice President of University Relations Thomas Sayles.
“Craig will collaborate closely with community leaders, non-profit organizations, local business, and USC faculty, staff and students in support of our engagement priorities,” Sayles said in the announcement. “He will also play a key role in building and maintaining strong relationships between the university’s research and outreach programs and will facilitate and implement President Nikias’ community initiatives, as well as document and evaluate the university’s community involvement.”
Keys previously worked on government and community outreach programs as principal consultant for Keys Consulting Group, a government affairs and public policy firm.
He serves on the board of Praxis Project Inc., which promotes cultural arts and entertainment projects, and is the managing board member and legal affairs director for NextAid Inc., a non-profit that finances sustainable development projects, constructs housing and provides resources for children in Africa impacted by AIDS.
Keys is a graduate of UC Berkeley, Columbia University, University of California Hastings College of the Law and the USC Marshall School of Business’ Ross Program in Real Estate Finance.
