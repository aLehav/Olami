I can remember several instances in my life when I had to buy an emergency notebook in the name of self-care — in high school when I thought my friend was about to lose her life; last August when my parents announced their plans to divorce; two weeks ago when the most significant romantic relationship I’ve ever been in came to an end. 
In each of these moments, I remember feeling so forlorn and frantic that I could no longer make sense of my own thoughts or emotions. It was like wrestling with shadows. The only way I know how to process such states of futility is through writing. Every time I pick up a pen and spill my neuroses onto the page, I am left with an inexplicable sense of hollow calm and emotional peace. I always come out of it feeling like I understand myself and my situation a little better. 
It also seems that I do my most poignant, creative writing in these times of vulnerability, when writing becomes a survival tactic more than a chore and my feelings are in their rawest form. Last fall, one of my columns addressed a question I have always been interested in: Does pain precede all great art? In considering the countless artistic behemoths who have led lives of melancholy and misfortune, it seems to be a self-evident truth that pain is a prerequisite for genius and that what tortures artists is also what makes them great. 
One of my favorite novels, “The Bell Jar,” sprung from the dark recesses of the mind of writer and poet Sylvia Plath, who notoriously gassed herself in the oven after a slew of suicide attempts throughout her tragically short life. In grappling with her divorce from Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo gave the world “Two Fridas,” a self-portrait of her dichotomous personalities which she later admitted were depictions of her different emotions as her marriage disintegrated. Even the Taj Mahal, one of the new Seven Wonders of the World and an imposing architectural feat, is a mausoleum commissioned by a Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in his late third wife’s memory. Time and time again, pain has yielded beauty that becomes a part of our culture. (Dare I mention any one of Taylor Swift’s gut-wrenching yet empowering break-up anthems?)
In many ways, art is the answer to the age-old queries about human existence and reasons for suffering. We look at art — more often than not the byproduct of someone else’s heartbreak — and find a piece of ourselves in it. In the process, we find solace in sharing another’s pain and start to fathom what it means to be alive and to have feelings and to not be alone in these experiences. Without suffering, we wouldn’t have art; and without art, suffering would be fruitless. 
I’ve also come to realize that more than being a repository for pain, art is, for myself and many great artists from history, a vehicle for healing. I like to imagine Vincent van Gogh applying the final brushstroke of his “Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear,” and enjoying a moment of serenity — perhaps even feeling at peace with his decision to cut off his own ear in an attempt to keep a lover, realizing that for all the torment he endured he had now created something beautiful to show for it. 
Even the medical community is recognizing the positive impact the arts can have on patients’ spiritual well-being and health. From drawing to dance and writing to music, studies have found that the arts empower patients to fulfill the basic human drive to create and imbue them with a newfound sense of possibility. Creative expression is astronomically conducive to healing because it allows people to regain a sense of wholeness — both as individuals and as part of the greater world. 
I have the same cathartic and restorative experience when journaling and, to a lesser and rarer extent, drawing and painting. In times of personal crisis, I am shocked by what comes out of me artistically. Retrospectively, as I reread the work I produced during melancholies past, I am impressed by my own ability for introspection and depth within my own psyche. I find that practicing creativity is essential to not only staying occupied but also persevering onward. 
Even as I near the end of this column, I feel calm and hopeful given that my thoughts and circumstances are more sensical to me now than they were when I started writing. I am comforted by the knowledge that some of the greatest masterpieces in art history were borne out of heartbreak and that my own spiritual well-being is in my control — all I have to do is put pencil to paper and write my heart out.

Directed by Brian Henson, son of Muppets creator Jim Henson, “The Happytime Murders” follows a hard-nosed cop played by Bill Barretta as he solves the murders of the cast of an 1980s puppet show, “Happytime Gang,” alongside partner Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy). (Photo by IMDb)
The perfect summer comedy was supposed to comprise actress Melissa McCarthy, “Sesame Street”-inspired puppets and an R-rating. Director Brian Henson could have made “The Happytime Murders” a groundbreaking piece of black comedy. Instead, he chose to add an unwanted ingredient: a worn-out plot.
“The Happytime Murders” takes place in a Los Angeles where humans and puppets coexist, and follows the actions of hard-nosed former cop Phil Phillips, a puppet voiced by Bill Barretta. Phillips is tasked with solving the mysterious murders of the cast of the cherished 1980s puppet show “Happytime Gang,” among whom were his brother and former girlfriend. To solve the case, Phillips has to reopen even more old wounds by teaming up with his unforgiving human ex-partner Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy). 
The puppet-based film was directed by Brian Henson, son of Muppets creator Jim Henson, who has had success combining obscene humor with innocent-looking characters in past projects like “Puppet Up!” 
Unlike “Puppet Up!,” audiences didn’t turn a blind eye to the stripping of puppets’ innocence for “The Happytime Murders.” The film’s marketing slogan — “No Sesame. All Street.” — and its trailer featuring drug use and puppet ejaculation was enough to get the G-rated “Sesame Street” creators involved, but after puppets performing as lawyers addressed the issue. U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick ruled in favor of Henson and STX  Entertainment.
That ruling has been the lone upside of the raunchy puppet comedy. Despite the free “Sesame Street” publicity, the STX production was a financial flop, scraping in a reported $10 million opening weekend. Possibly sensing impending failure, the film’s cast members seemingly tried distancing themselves as much as contractually possible; stars Elizabeth Banks and McCarthy left no traces that they had been involved in the project on their social media accounts.
Regardless of marketing or talent involvement, “The Happytime Murders” fails because its ideas are tired by every measure, and no amount of puppet pornography gags can make up for a blatant lack of innovation and originality. Even with a run-of-the-mill plot, the film’s comedy writing could still be the antidote to a poisonous storyline. Unfortunately, its dosage was too low. Moreover, the action sequences presented in the film are hardly different from predictable works such as Netflix’s “Bright” or ABC’s “Quantico.”
Jenny (Elizabeth Banks), a former cast member of “The Happytime Gang,” advises Phillips in the film, “Every poison has an antidote,” pointing out the detective’s poisonous effects on loved ones. This quote had the potential to serve as a greater purpose had producers taken it into account. 
The film is riddled with missed opportunities and underdeveloped dialogues; Henson’s concept had  potential to strike comedy gold, but his lack of forethought resulted in yet another bland and unoriginal comedy flick. 
The few scenes featuring pure puppet mania and an unhinged McCarthy were the clear highpoints of the hour-and-a-half-long production. Laughter resounded in the theater as a puppet dog was in control of a BDSM relationship with a human firefighter, and it grew louder when McCarthy got high snorting pure glucose through a Twizzler. Even so, these rare moments of hilarity only stood out for what felt like a fraction of the duration of the film. 
While “The Happytime Murders” has some redeeming moments, its comedic components aren’t used enough to salvage a stale, unoriginal murder-mystery plot. As a whole, the raunchy puppet comedy is a disappointing addition to the Henson legacy.

Two-meter man Matt Maier earned an All-America Honorable Mention and an All-MPSF Honorable Mention last season. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
One year after playing in the national championship, the USC men’s water polo team returns  with high expectations once again, despite fielding an extremely young roster. 
Last December, the Trojans managed an impressive NCAA tournament run featuring a dramatic come-from-behind victory in the national semifinals against Cal. Following an improbable 12-11 victory over the Golden Bears, the Men of Troy lined up against crosstown rival UCLA with the national championship on the line. Despite a strong start, the Bruins proved to be too much for USC as the Trojans fell 7-5 and UCLA took home its 11th title in school history.
Eight months later, the Trojans now look forward to a new season with high hopes. Following the 2017 title run, the USC men’s team lost 10 seniors including starting goalie McQuin Baron, USC’s all-time saves leader, and driver Blake Edwards, who ranks ninth on USC’s all-time scoring list.
Replacing Baron and Edwards will be difficult, but USC has a strong crop of young talent that can help fill the gaps. Leading the way is sophomore driver Marko Vavic who paced the team in scoring with 51 goals in 2017. The son of coach Jovan Vavic, Marko Vavic was also selected to play on the U.S. Men’s Senior National Team alongside Trojans McQuin and former driver Thomas Dunstan.
Aside from Marko Vavic, the Trojan defense is still very much a work in progress. With McQuin gone, only redshirt freshman Matt Moran-Flores returns from last season’s roster and will battle four true freshmen for the job. His biggest competitor will likely be Sam Krutonog, a Harvard-Westlake graduate and All-CIF First Team pick. Krutonog is a member of the U.S. Cadet National Team and has earned high praise from Jovan Vavic as “a student of the game [with] poise under pressure.”
Looking into the team’s schedule in 2018, USC will again take on some of the nation’s best squads early. The team’s season opener on Sept. 1 comes in the UCLA Mini Invitational against Pomona-Pitzer, a squad that finished last season ranked 18th in the nation. 
USC will find its first elite competition when it hosts Pacific in late September. After winning 11-7 in last year’s meeting on the road in Stockton, Calif., the Trojans will have a great opportunity early in the season to build experience against a projected NCAA tournament team.
Following the Pacific match, the Trojans will go on a long stretch of play through October in which they participate in two tournaments on top of five matches against top-10 opponents such as Stanford, Long Beach State and UC Santa Barbara.
While USC will likely have a chance to rematch UCLA at the Mountain Pacific Invitational in mid-October, the two will return to the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Nov. 10 in the final match of the regular season. Hot on the heels of a Nov. 3 showdown against California, USC’s match against the Bruins will set the tone for the Men of Troy as they head into the MPSF Tournament the next weekend and eventually the NCAA Championships.
While the team will not host  the finals as they did in 2017, the Trojans will again look to surprise and succeed this year.

When head coach Clay Helton announced Sunday that true freshman JT Daniels would be taking over the helm as the Trojans’ starting quarterback for Saturday’s season opener against UNLV, he was taking a risk — albeit a calculated one. 
With a total of three collegiate games played — not started, but played — among the three rostered quarterbacks, the competition for the starting job among redshirt sophomore Matt Fink, redshirt freshman Jack Sears and Daniels started on a rather even playing field. The one wrinkle thrown into that situation was the fact that only a year ago, Daniels was supposed to be entering his senior year of high school while Fink and Sears began fall camp.
For Daniels, just about all the tangibles and intangibles of a Power Five starting quarterback are there. Throwing for over 4,100 yards with 52 touchdowns in his final season at Mater Dei? Check. Collecting the best possible personal and team accolades possible in winning a state and national championship while being honored as the 2017-18 Gatorade High School Male Athlete of the Year? Check. Showing, by all accounts, wisdom well beyond his years and a capacity for the limelight that has become a necessity as the USC signal caller? Check.
Yet, the inherent risk lies in a player who has only formally practiced with the team for a few months. Learning the playbook, creating chemistry with upperclassmen wideouts such as redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and junior Michael Pittman: These are skills that can only come with time. 
In his eyes, however, Helton feels that Daniels’ time has come. His maturity is the quality that shines through more than any other.
“As you can imagine JT was excited when we let him know,” Helton said. “But his uncanny maturity kept him focused on what is next.”
As is with the theme of Daniels’ college career so far, the quarterback enters rarified territory becoming just the second true freshman to start a USC season opener since Matt Barkley in 2009. In fact, Daniels is just one of four to ever do so at USC, joining Barkley, Heisman trophy winner Carson Palmer and Cotton Bowl champion Rob Johnson.
The biggest lingering question about Daniels is his ability to come in and ease the pain of transitioning from an all-time USC great in Sam Darnold to, well, anyone else. If anything, Daniels is a barometer of what kind of program the Trojans are at the moment. 
In the early 2000s, USC was able to replace Palmer with Matt Leinart, a Heisman trophy winner and two-time national champion. John David Booty, who won two Rose Bowls, would follow Leinart. Compare this to the years that would follow in which many talented, highly touted quarterbacks would fail to maintain the same level of excellence, and it leaves the Trojans in a state of flux.
As much as Daniels will be interesting to watch for his own growth as a player, it will be even more appealing to watch what he does to continue Darnold’s legacy of success. 
Who knows? Maybe after all the fire Helton has come under since being hired two years ago, it turns out he’s just as great a quarterback whisperer as Pete Carroll. Certainly, it will take a few national championships with some Heisman trophies sprinkled in before we can properly compare the two, but it’s not outside the realm of possibility.
In terms of what will be seen from Daniels now, it is unreasonable to have the same expectations for him that fans and media alike had of Darnold a year ago. Daniels, as good as he may be, is unlikely to be playing for a national championship this year. He may not even play for a Rose Bowl; currently the sights are set on taking the season one week at a time. 
Unlike Darnold, Daniels is in a situation where he can truly grow. First, while he has just come out of a quarterback competition in camp, he doesn’t have a five-star junior like Max Browne breathing down his neck. Second, Daniels gets real game action and plenty of practice reps to work with the first team offense, luxuries not truly afforded to Darnold until Week 4 of his magical 2016 campaign. 
Lastly, Daniels is a true freshman. At the very least, he will have a full three years to work in the USC system, establish his play style, and, even, bring USC back to the level it was at heading into 2017.
For now, Daniels and Helton are just worried about UNLV, and they’ll let the rest of their bright future together fall into place.

Junior catcher/utility player Blake Sabol led the Chantham Anglers in batting average this past summer (.340). (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The USC baseball team is back on campus, and that means the return of the 14 incumbent players who participated summer ball. Here’s a recap of how they fared the last few months.
Four Trojans earned All-Star or All-League honors in 2018. The standout was junior catcher/utility player Blake Sabol, a member of the East Division team for the Cape Cod League All-Star Game. Sabol led the Chatham Anglers with a .340 batting average, good for fourth in the league. He also paced his team with seven home runs, which ranked second in the league and earned him a spot in its home run derby.
“Sabol has this summer played everywhere on the diamond but pitcher, second base and shortstop,” wrote Baseball America’s Teddy Cahill in naming Sabol one of Cape Cod’s five rising star hitters in July. “Wherever Sabol plays this summer, he has produced at the plate.”
Fellow junior Brady Shockey also impressed as a member of the Palm Springs Power of the Southern California Collegiate League. The outfielder led his team with a .384 batting average, to go with a .419 on base percentage and .535 slugging percentage. Shockey earned a spot on the 2018 All-SCCBL first team as one of three outfielders selected.
Junior infielder John Thomas was selected to the California Collegiate League Prospect Game, as he placed fifth in the league in batting average at .341. He also posted a .439 on base percentage and a .514 slugging percentage.
Junior Chris Clarke was the only USC pitcher to be honored in such a way; he was chosen as the starter for the South Division in the Ripken League All-Star Game. His 2.73 earned run average was a big part of his team-best 4-0 record, along with his 27 strikeouts in 31.1 innings.
Although these were the only four honored by their leagues, they were not the only successful Trojans this summer. Sabol was joined in Chatham by two sophomores in pitcher Kyle Hurt and shortstop Ben Ramirez. Hurt posted a 3.38 ERA and 27 strikeouts in 26.2 innings, as well as notching a save for the Anglers in the playoffs. While Ramirez struggled at the plate for the most part, he tallied 14 RBI on 22 hits and six stolen bases.
Junior closer Connor Lunn, also in the Cape Cod League, was impressive, with a 3-1 record, 2.28 ERA, and a miniscule .174 opponent’s batting average. Junior outfielder Matthew Acosta led the Green Bay Bullfrogs of the Northwoods League with a .588 slugging percentage and .980 OPS. He also held the second-highest batting average on the team at .338.
Sophomore pitcher John Beller touted a team-best 0.48 ERA and a .127 opposing batting average. His 0.80 WHIP was good for second on his team, the Portland Pickles of the West Coast League. Beller was joined in Portland by redshirt sophomore catcher Daniel Edson (14 runs in 30 appearances) and sophomore pitcher Augie Sylk (44 strikeouts in 30.1 innings).
Freshman utility player Bart West flashed a good eye in the California Collegiate League, leading the Conejo Oaks with 16 walks. He also posted a .273/.380/.352 line in 88 at bats for Conejo and placed second in the league in sacrifice flies with three.
Sophomore pitcher Riley Lamb played for the New England Collegiate League champion Valley Blue Sox. He held hitters to a batting average of .217 and finished the season with a K/9 average of 9.17. He pitched one inning of relief in the team’s championship-clinching game against the Ocean State Waves.
After a 26-28 season in 2018, the Trojans will feel the pressure to improve. Those who had successful summer ball stints will look to build on their progress; those who disappointed will have to address their weaknesses, heading into the 2019 season.

Senior running back Aca’Cedric Ware takes a handoff from former quarterback Sam Darnold. Ware is slated to fill the big shoes of former running back Ronald Jones for week one against UNLV. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
The Trojan football team released its official depth chart for the season opener against UNLV on Saturday, along with an announcement earlier in the day that freshman JT Daniels would be the starting quarterback. Though most of the depth chart stayed true to the expected rotations from training camp, it also contained a number of surprises. Here are some of the most notable observations by position group.
Quarterback
Daniels was the best quarterback throughout camp by a large margin — it shouldn’t come as a huge shock to anybody that he’ll be starting Week 1. He’ll be the only true freshman to start the season at QB for USC other than fellow Mater Dei High School alumnus Matt Barkley, who started in 2009. Perhaps the bigger surprise on the quarterback depth chart was redshirt freshman Jack Sears at No. 3, after redshirt sophomore Matt Fink. Sears outperformed Fink for most of camp, and even appeared to challenge Daniels at times. His placement on the depth chart seems to suggest that he’ll likely transfer out sometime soon.
Running Back
Senior Aca’Cedric Ware earned the top spot on the chart, after taking a majority of first team reps throughout camp. Many expected sophomore Stephen Carr to take the top job after doing well in camp after returning from back surgery, especially considering his impressive performance as a freshman last year. Surprisingly, Carr is third on the depth chart behind redshirt sophomore Vavae Malepeai. It’s hard to tell why Carr is listed that low — perhaps due to a flare-up of his injury — but the situation will be worth monitoring during the next few weeks.
Wide Receiver
It should surprise nobody that redshirt sophomore Tyler Vaughns and junior Michael Pittman are starting out wide. They finished last year strong and have had impressive offseasons. True freshman Amon-Ra St. Brown is listed as the second stringer out wide behind Pittman despite a great camp, while the starting slot receiver spot belongs to redshirt sophomore Velus Jones. St. Brown could be seen getting more reps, even supplanting Jones for the job.
Offensive Line
The offensive line rotation came out as expected, with sophomore Austin Jackson, redshirt seniors Chris Brown and Toa Lobendahn, sophomore Andrew Voorhees and senior Chuma Edoga starting from left to right. Although most of those spots have been stable throughout the offseason, Jackson had been competing with redshirt junior Clayton Bradley for the starting left tackle role. Jackson won out that competition and it looks like Bradley will be the preferred backup for both tackle spots.
Defensive Backs
The starting corner position opposite senior Biggie Marshall was open during the offseason, with senior Isaiah Langley and redshirt freshman Greg Johnson battling for it until the end of camp. Although both players flashed, Johnson had a solid and consistent performance in the past few weeks. He was given the nod to start for week one. Langley will be right behind him on the depth chart, with freshman Olaijah Griffin as the other second string corner behind Marshall following a strong finish to camp. 
Cornerback wasn’t the only position battle in the secondary, as the starting strong safety job was also up for grabs. Redshirt junior Ykili Ross came into camp running with the first team at the position, until an injury knocked him out early during camp. Sophomore Bubba Bolden took most of the reps in his place, and will be the one to line up beside senior Marvell Tell with the first team during the season opener. Ross will transfer out of USC in the upcoming weeks, having  expressed frustration with his situation.
Punt Returner
Although starting redshirt senior nickelback Ajene Harris set the majority of reps as the first punt returner throughout camp, St. Brown will be headlining the depth chart at that position. St. Brown has always been immediately after Harris in the punt return rotation, and looked impressive during his opportunities to run them back. Since he’s still listed with the second team as a receiver, letting him handle primary punt return duties will get him more touches per game, allowing him to make plays with the ball in his hands.
