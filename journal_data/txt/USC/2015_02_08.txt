On Sunday, Residential Student Government hosted its second annual Spring Showcase student leadership conference in King Hall. The conference was attended by each of the 16 different building governments, one from each of the university’s residential communities.
Each of the building governments officials who were elected by students in their respective residential communities, delivered presentations on programming and advocacy efforts executed last semester, and also laid out plans for this semester.
RSG purchased mugs that read “I make a difference. I am BG.” for the conference’s 100 attendees.
“They all do amazing work, and this is a chance for them to get recognized for all that they do,” said Michael Tong, RSG’s National Residence Hall honorary president.
“It’s a really great way for our building governments to get recognition for the work they are doing for their communities and for their residents, and also for them to gather new ideas to try for this semester,” Tong said. “The building government members came into the conference nervous for the semester but left confident and ready to really make an impact in their residence halls … it really meant a lot to me.”
“The conference is a great way for the building governments to share what they did last year and get re-motivated to inspire their communities this semester,” said RSG President Sera Choi, who created the Spring Showcase conference last year.
“I really liked the opportunity to see what the other building governments have been up to.  I loved some of their ideas to boost participation and attendance at programs,” said Peter Bergmann, a freshman who serves as president of Birnkrant building government. “While the Spring Showcase was a chance to reflect on our past semester and see what we could do to improve. The atmosphere is always filled with energy, so even though we started early on a Sunday morning, we were able to get some good work done.”
New to this year’s conference was a roll call ceremony, during which all delegations performed songs and dances to introduce their governments.
“The ice breakers at the conference really helped [us] bond. RSG’s recognition of our accomplishments motivated us to reach our goals this semester,” said Katie Han, a freshman who serves as president of Marks Tower’s building government.
“The Spring Showcase really engaged building government members to think about how they can best lead and serve their respective buildings … For my team personally, it also sparked new ideas and ways in which we can continue to connect with our residents,” said Tayanna Todd, a freshman who serves as president of Webb Tower’s building government. “As a building government president, it was great to see my entire team engaged in the event and taking pride in the fact that we are part of the larger group dynamic that is really making a difference on this campus”
This month, Residential Student Government will also be hosting its annual Spring Into Service community outreach fair, where students can learn about the many community service organizations on campus. The event will be held at McCarthy Quad on Feb. 26 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Ming Hsieh, a USC trustee and alumnus, was recently elected to the National Academy of Engineering. This position is one of the most esteemed professional honors that can be granted to engineers.
“I am very humbled and excited to be a member of the academy,” Hsieh said in a statement released by USC News. “It is a great honor to be recognized by the highest national engineering organization. I deeply appreciate and would like to share this recognition with my beloved USC, industrial colleagues and family and friends for the education, inspiration and support provided to me during the past 35 years.”
Hsieh, founder of 3M Cogent Inc., has previously worked as the company’s chief executive officer and chairman since 1990. Hsieh was also the vice-president of AMAX technology; a computer server and storage systems company, from 1987 to 1990.
During his time at USC, Hsieh has funded the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical Engineering and established the Ming Hsieh Institute of Engineering-Medicine for Cancer.
Known for his desire to bridge the gap between engineering and medicine, Hsieh has received accolades for starting Fulgent Therapeutics, a cancer drug research facility that customizes cancer treatments and genetic diagnostics.
“It is really wonderful to see that Ming Hsieh’s technological and engineering impact is aptly recognized through his election to the NAE,” said USC Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yortsos said in a statement released by USC News. “All of us at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering — and particularly in electrical engineering — the department which carries his name — are thrilled by this recognition.”
The pursuit of higher education by his uncle, P.Y. Hsieh, created the framework for Hsieh to pursue his undergraduate and graduate degrees at USC.
Hsieh is a native to Shenyang, China, and traveled to Southern California in 1980 to finish his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering through USC’s engineering program. Hsieh also completed his master’s degree in electrical engineering through USC in 1984.
His company, Cogent Systems, has been noted by scholars in the field of engineering as a revolutionary feat in fingerprint identification services. Cogent Systems is a global biometric identification service that serves local and state-wide law enforcement agencies, governments and commercial enterprises.

The USC Black Alumni Association, along with the UCLA Black Alumni Association and Ebony Magazine, hosted the Aligning for Black Excellence in Higher Education Summit Saturday morning, which highlighted the importance surrounding higher education in the African-American community through speeches by USC professors, company executives and students. The four-hour event was held at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The keynote speaker was Dr. Robert Ross, president and CEO of California Endowment and a member of President’s Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for African Americans.
Near the end of the conference, David J. Johns, executive director of the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, touched on the difference between attending college and graduating from college.
“Do you believe that your child or children are capable of graduating from college?” Johns said. “Those words are intentional. We spend too much time worrying about getting them to college. No — they need to graduate from college. They’re obligated to.”
Johns then proceeded to outline the circumstances necessary for getting students into college, using a visit to a Las Vegas school as a point of reference.
“First, [students] ask for love. They first want to know that you care about them before they care what you know,” he said. “[Students] said that sometimes they don’t get attention unless they’re in an AP class or well below average. We need to pay attention to all of our babies, including those who sometimes get lost in the middle.”
Johns stressed the importance of honest communication between parents and children, a task made difficult by the changing conditions of the African-American community over recent decades.
“We need to have tough conversations about race, class, sexuality and things that make people [feel] uncomfortable. We need to get out of the habit of not listening when they speak. We can’t play Oppression Olympics,” Johns said. “It is a natural reaction to say, ‘Oh, baby, it’s OK. You don’t know what it’s like to have it bad.’ But the reality is that our babies go through things right now that would break the average adult.”
The event included two panels, one on the topic of “External Stakeholder Perspectives” and one on “Trends Impacting Competitive College Readiness and Completion Outcomes.”  The first panel included Dr. Michéle G. Turner, executive director of the USC Black Alumni Association; George McKenna, LAUSD board member; and Nolan Rollins, president and CEO of Los Angeles Urban League.  The second panel featured Jay Tucker, chief marketing officer and head of programs for the Institute for Communication Technology Management; Constance Iloh, Ph.D. candidate in urban education policy at the Pullias Center for Higher Education within the Rossier School of Education; and Dr. Sharoni Little, associate professor at the Marshall School of Business.
The conference ended with a speech by Princeton Parker, a senior majoring in communication and a Black Alumni Association scholar. In his speech, Parker mentioned that the African-American community must realize that obtaining a higher education, working a job and spending time with family is achievable.
Parker explained that he is an example of a young student leader who desires to make a difference among African-American students in higher education across the nation.
“I stand as one example of the possibility and the propensity of young black students and leaders to make differences and achieve higher levels at institutions across this country,” Parker said. “I come to talk because we gather under the impetus of a problem. What’s at stake is our freedom, because to be educated is to be free.”
Parker’s speech then focused on common misconceptions about freedom, which he argued is part of a cultural mentality.
“To have a platform is not freedom either, because there are many of our most famous entertainers who on the increasing glare of the spotlight have a huge platform, but once they enter a new plateau they choose to adapt,” Parker said. “They become post-racial, colorblind things, denying the legacy of the DNA of blackness that helped make them who they are. And when you throw away your garment of blackness to appear more global or American, I’m afraid you’re not free.”
Parker argued that true freedom comes only from critical inquiry and reflection as a result of education, and that it should be shared instead of hoarded.
“To be free is not just to get an education for yourself,” he said. “To be free is to be able to get your diploma and go right back to your church, your cousins, your projects, your families, and let them know that you’re not uniquely special — they can do the same thing you’ve done.”
Students at the event shared their thoughts on challenges facing the African-American community in the 21st century. Julia Badji, a freshman majoring in human biology, expressed her views on the role of opportunity in getting African-Americans into college.
“Young students don’t know about the opportunities out there, and they aren’t allowed to reach them,” Badji said. “They have the potential and the ability, but they don’t have the resources.”
Candice Wright, a freshman majoring in economics, agreed with this perspective.
“Black students comprise about 4 percent of the student body, and that is unacceptable,” Wright said. “It’s not simply about getting accepted to college. It’s not by choice that African-Americans choose not to go to college — it’s by circumstances and financial burden.”

El Centro Chicano partnered with Disney Studios to host a private screening of McFarland, USA and a Q&A with director Niki Caro on Friday night for the USC community two weeks before the film’s opening.
USC Trustee Monica Lozano and her husband David Ayon connected El Centro to Disney Studios for the screening at Regal Cinemas LA Live. The predominantly Latino audience of about 300 consisted mostly of USC students, but also included alumni, staff and faculty associated with El Centro.
The film features Kevin Costner as an out-of-place white football coach who forms a cross-country team of Mexican-American students in the poor town of McFarland, California.

William Vela, the director of El Centro Chicano, USC’s on-campus cultural center for Latino students, announced during the Q&A that the movie was an important step toward mainstream appreciation of Latinos’ diverse experiences.
“This is an opportunity for Hollywood and other groups to take it to the next level because our community deserves to be heard and deserves to be on the screen,” he said before introducing Caro and supporting actors Carlos Pratts and Ramiro Rodriguez, who play cross-country runners Thomas Valles and Danny Diaz.
Caro also spoke about the power of Latinos as consumers.
“The Latin audience is the single biggest audience in this country. You bring in so many billions of dollars in the entertainment world, and you have power,” Caro said. “If this film is commercially successful there will be 10 more like it next year.”
Several USC students who grew up in and around McFarland expressed their surprise at seeing their own struggles represented.
“It really hit home,” a student from Farmersville said to Caro. “A lot of people lose hope … they feel that a lot of people don’t believe in them. I grew up since I was little, picking olives — that’s the lifestyle. I also did cross country. And all these little towns really get forgotten. People that leave to go to college, they never go back.”
Rodriguez was from McFarland and grew up in conditions similar to that of his character in the film. He attended McFarland High School and was acquainted with the real-life person he portrayed, Danny Diaz.
When asked about the film’s connection to American immigration issues, Caro spoke at length about the contributions Latinos make to the United States as a part of the economy and from a cultural standpoint.
“I can’t understand why the conversation exists in the first place,” Caro said. “Mexicans are the backbone of this state. If you leave we’re all in trouble. I hope the whole immigration issue doesn’t get to your spirits too much. I’ve come to realize what we’ve made is a profoundly American film with all the values that the Latino cultures hold so dear,” Caro said. “Faith, family, community, hard work. Those are core American values and you’re keeping those alive.”
Braulio Hoyos, special projects assistant for El Centro, explained that there should be a stronger Latino presence on campus.
“USC is supposed to be 14 percent Latino students,” Hoyos said. “However, when you walk around campus you usually don’t see that, it doesn’t feel like it. I think everyone at USC should watch this film because it portrays a lot of the Latino culture. I think the USC community doesn’t really know and understand what the Mexican community is about.”
Darline Robles, a professor at the Rossier School of Education, discussed how positive Latino stories are often lost on the university.
“You don’t often see positive stories about the Latino community, and the USC community sits right in the middle of the Latino community.”
Vela first became interested in a community-wide screening of McFarland after he and a few students watched it at Disney Studios last November.
“We were just blown away by it and really wanted to show it at ’SC,” he said. “[This film] is for our community but it’s also for the greater world. It’s for other communities to better understand our community and better see our community through our eyes.”

The USC track team spent the weekend competing against the best teams in the country, including teams from the Big Ten, Big 12, SEC and Pac-12, in the 40th Annual Frank Sevigne Husker Invitational at the Bob Devaney Sports Center Indoor Track in Lincoln, Neb.
Friday’s competition consisted mainly of qualifying rounds for the Trojans.
“This is our first meet this year on a banked track and for most of the freshmen their first time ever,” USC Director of Track and Field Caryl Smith Gilbert said.
The Trojans had eight athletes advance out of their heats into the finals. Among them was freshman Dior Hall who ran a season-best 8.22 in the 60m HH. On the second day of the competition, however, Hall would best her own record with a 8.14 on her way to victory and setting a USC freshman record. Hall is tied for the second fastest time on the NCAA descending order list.
Another top performer for the Trojans this weekend was redshirt senior Conor McCullough. The transfer from Princeton won the men’s weight throw and chalked a new meet and school record. On McCullough’s second throw he notched 74-7.00, which broke a meet record that had been in place since 2007.
“Our throwers have a lot more in the tank, although they had PR’s as well,” Gilbert said.
McCullough smashed the competition, winning by almost three feet. In addition, three of his six throws were good enough to win the event. After his performance, McCullough is three-for-three in weight throw competitions in his career. Friday’s performance puts him in third place in the country.
“Today we performed outstanding[ly] in most events,” Gilbert said. “We had national-caliber efforts and wins in the women’s hurdles, sprints, middle distance, relays and men’s sprints.”
In both the men’s and women’s 60m dashes the Trojans took home first. On the women’s side of the competition, freshman Ky Westbrook placed first with a time of 7.34. The Women of Troy also took second, third, fourth and sixth in the event. For the men, junior Andre De Grasse set a PR and took first with a time of 6.60. The time is good enough for fifth on the NCAA descending order list nationally.
De Grasse had a busy weekend as he also won the 200m dash. With a time of 20.79, which was a new personal record for De Grasse, he placed fifth on the NCAA indoor list for the season.
In the women’s 200m, redshirt junior Tynia Gaither ran her fastest time of the season, a 23.44, and won the event. The time is also the eighth fastest in the nation. The Women of Troy had great success in the 200m. In addition to Gaither’s first-place finish, USC also took second, third, fifth, seventh, eighth, ninth and 13th.
Despite traveling with significantly fewer athletes than the other teams at the meet, both USC squads finished second in the scoring behind home-team Nebraska.
Up next for the Trojans are two meets over Feb. 13 and 14: the Don Kirby Elite Meet held in Albuquerque, N.M., and the Husky Classic run in Seattle, Wash.

If a college football program were to describe its ideal signing day, it would be eerily similar to what transpired for USC last Wednesday. The Trojan football team performed perfectly in what could go down as one the greatest national signing days in USC history. While that might sound hyperbolic before spring practice even begins, last Wednesday meant a lot more than just bringing in the    No. 1 nationally-ranked class.
The excitement and anticipation for signing day reached a fever pitch on Tuesday morning when top-rated linebacker Porter Gustin committed to USC. Prior to the announcement, rumors that Urban Meyer and Ohio State were able to secure a silent commitment during the Utah area prospect’s official visit to Columbus arose. That proved false when Gustin donned the Cardinal and Gold hat in his video announcement, setting the stage for Wednesday.
Much like last year, when Sarkisian and company were able to close on the talented trio of Adoree’ Jackson, Juju Smith and Damien Mama, last Wednesday presented another chance to assert southbound recruiting dominance for the Trojans. They hit on this year’s big three, nabbing linebacker John Houston and lineman Rasheem Green from Serra and coupling that with defensive back Iman Marshall from Long Beach Polytechnic.
After closing on the final five commits — Osa Masina and the aforementioned four — it was assumed that the Trojans had closed out their class. They had one last surprise in store, however. Through blue shirting offensive lineman Clayton Johnston, they were able to add Salesian defensive lineman Kevin Scott to add an exclamation point to a phenomenal day.
Much like Lamont Simmons last year, Scott could be the under the radar prospect signed at the last minute that ends up paying major dividends down the road. While Simmons didn’t have an impact last year, he adds depth to secondary moving forward. The same can be said about Scott, who at 6-foot-5 and 280 pounds can grow into his frame and add versatility to the line.
The influx of talent is huge for the Trojans. In between injuries and sanctions, the roster has been whittled down significantly. The first full class in the Sarkisian era will alleviate some areas of concern. The team won’t fully recover for another year or two, but it definitely helps to have so many freshmen who can contribute right away.
Much has been made about the fact that rankings aren’t always accurate and this excitement might be premature. One can point at highly-touted recruits at USC who never materialized like Whitney Lewis, Cyrus Hobbi and Blake Ayles. However, for every Lewis and Ayles there is also a Brian Cushing or Rey Mauluagua, who were both top 20 recruits when they were brought to USC.
Given the choice between a bevy of five-star recruits and an average recruiting class, every coach in the country would take the highly-touted prospects. Now it’s up to the position coaches and players to fulfill their immense potential as individuals, and as a class.
The jury is still out regarding the effects the players will have on the field, but even more profound than the talent grab is the effect that last Wednesday had on the USC football program’s reputation. Los Angeles is a frontrunner city, and when teams are good, the fan base comes out.
That’s just how it is, and it probably won’t ever change. The fan base came out on Wednesday — students could be overheard casually discussing the commitments of Green and Houston. People even streamed the Iman Marshall announcement and music video in class. The last few years have been plagued by empty seats in the student section. Outside of the 2013 Stanford game, this is the first time there has been a noticeable level of excitement and attention paid to the team on campus. There was a palpable level of tension prior to Marshall’s announcement. That buzz has been missing, and Wednesday was the first sign that it could be coming back.
On a grander scale, USC flexed its muscles to the college football world. Teams that go 9-4 don’t generally close on every single target. Even more impressive, not one Trojan-commit defected on signing day. When was the last time a school got over 20 teenagers to stay resolute in their commitment?
Pac-12 teams definitely took notice. Even though Oregon has dominated the conference the last couple of years and just played in the national championship game, they were thoroughly outclassed by the Trojans on the recruiting trail. UCLA has beat USC three straights on the field, and while they put together a great class in their own right, they didn’t beat out USC head-to-head for any of the top LA-based prospects.
Free from the unjust sanctions of the NCAA, the Trojans made a statement on Wednesday. To the NCAA, they effectively said that no matter how hard it tries to cripple USC, we still are a national powerhouse. Reputation and public perception matter when it comes to college football. USC did a lot to boost their credibility last Wednesday; now the key is making sure the on-field product matches the recruiting abilities of the Trojan program.

After suffering a five-game losing streak, the women’s basketball team bounced back with two Pac-12 wins against Colorado and Utah.
Teamwork was key to the team’s wins this weekend.  Redshirt sophomore guard Jordan Adams and senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama were the glue that kept the team together, racking up assists.
“We executed on both ends of the floor first half,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said. “I thought that set the tone of the game.”
Eight Women of Troy contributed points in the win against Utah on Friday. Freshman guard McKenzie Calvert led in scoring with 16 points and three steals. Senior forward Kaneisha Horn made a well-rounded effort, leading in defense with eight rebounds and scoring 11 points.
Ball movement and strong defense were the ingredients to the Women of Troy’s conquest over the Utes.
Though the Utes were the first to score, the Women of Troy started with a 3-pointer from sophomore guard Courtney Jaco after both teams went scoreless for the first two minutes. Utah responded and maintained a lead. The Utes looked promising in the early minutes of the game, grabbing nine rebounds and three assists in the first six minutes.
“What impressed me the most was the defensive stops,” Cooper-Dyke said. “When we made that extra pass, it’s just a beautiful thing to watch.”
The tables quickly turned for Utah, as the Women of Troy went on an offensive rampage. Ball-sharing came easily for USC; the result was Adams earning three assists and a layup in three minutes. Calvert shot accurately behind the arc and in the inside; she earned five points within the same span of time.
USC’s defense kept the Utes on the outside, and scores in the paint were unsuccessful. The Women of Troy were very physical with Utes, gathering 10 personal fouls by the end of the first half.
The foul calls did not stop USC offensively, and junior guard Brianna Barrett kept the tempo fast and earned a layup along the way. These elements would lead the Women of Troy to a 15-point advantage at the half, 36-21.
At the beginning of the second, USC made up for missed shots with offensive rebounds and earned a field goal. Utah began to fill the deficit some, but the Women of Troy kept them at a sizeable distance.
“We did really good in transition,” Horn said. “We hadn’t been doing so good with our transition buckets and I think we pushed the ball well today.”
After a short dry spell, USC would score 11 points within a span of four minutes, compared to the four points Utah scored.
The Utes sent three Trojans to the line, increasing USC’s advantage. USC would win a dominant 73-54 over Utah.
On the heels of the win against Utah, USC faced another Pac-12 opponent in Colorado at the Galen Center on Sunday.
The first half started slowly, as both teams were unable to score for almost two minutes. USC scored first, as Barrett grabbed a fast break point with the help of a steal by Vaioletama.
Vaioletama would quickly earn an assist, feeding the ball to Adams. The Buffs had a scoring drought for three minutes, giving the Women of Troy a chance to score four points within that time.
The Buffs made it tough for the Trojans to score, Calvert grabbed a fast break point after the team struggled from the outside. Shortly after, Jaco hit a field goal. With 11:54 left, the Trojans led the Buffs, 12-6.
The Buffs began catching USC with some timely 3-pointers, bringing Colorado up to a one-point deficit with 8:13 left in the first half.
Freshmen forwards Kristen Simon and Amy Okonkwo were key players in keeping USC in the game offensively. As Colorado maintained a lead, Simon scored a free throw and layup, while Okonkwo had a layup.
At the half, the Women of Troy were trailing 21-23 to the Buffs. Colorado had a lot of fight in them, their offense was filled with speed and dives for the ball. Several jump balls were called throughout the first half.
USC charged out with much energy at the beginning of the second half. Vaioletama’s offensive grew to a high level of intensity. Vaioletama made a pair of 3-pointers within a minute of each other.
“I think that’s really big that she put those two in for us,” Adams said. “A lot of the posts, they’re already down in the paint and they don’t respect her jump shot as much as they should.”
The Buffs made a painful mistake by fouling the Women of Troy, who shot at 80 percent from the key. Horn, Vaioletama and Adams made all of their free throws.
Colorado kept forcing the Women of Troy to commit turnovers. Their defense in the paint caused USC to make mistakes. However, USC had a 13-point lead within the first five minutes of the second half.
The Women of Troy kept pouring in points, the efforts of Horn and Barrett would keep Colorado at a double-digit distance.
With less than five minutes left, the Women of Troy added on 12 more points. Though the Buffs would add 10 points in that time, they would lose 66-51 to the Women of Troy.
USC will travel north to face Stanford and Cal on Friday at 6 p.m. and Sunday at 6:30 p.m., respectively.

Moderate showers made for a short but sweet day at work for the USC men’s tennis team Saturday, as the top-ranked Trojans swept the UC Irvine Anteaters 7-0.
The Trojans were also set to face the San Diego State Aztecs in the second match of day, but the match was postponed due to rainy weather.
Rain poured down on Marks Stadium, but not before the defending NCAA champions cleaned house in the singles round of the match — the Trojans took all six points in singles without dropping a set.
No. 8-ranked senior Jonny Wang opened the day with a win over the Anteaters’ Tyler Pham 6-2, 6-0. Next, senior Eric Johnson logged an immaculate match against Irvine’s Shuhei Shibahara, defeating Shibahara 6-0, 6-0 to put the Trojans up 2-0. Sophomore Connor Farren then dispatched Anteater Justin Agbayani 6-1, 6-1, pushing the Trojans’ lead to three.
Junior Max de Vroome and senior Yannick Hanfmann, ranked No. 104 and No. 3 in the nation respectively, followed suit with victories over Anteaters Rafael Davidian and Nico Mertens. De Vroome topped Davidian, and Hanfmann defeated Mertens by scores of 6-2, 6-2 and 6-2, 6-3. No. 58-ranked sophomore Nick Crystal closed things out with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Jonathan Hammel to put the Trojans up 6-0.
Head coach Peter Smith shared concern over his team’s footwork earlier in the season, but has been happy with the improvement in terms of fitness and footwork since then.
“We’re in much better shape; we’re much more match-tough, and all those things add up to being comfortable,” Smith said. “When you’re uncomfortable, your footwork goes. When you’re a little out of shape, your footwork goes. We’re looking much more comfortable and really ready to play.”
As the drizzle began during doubles play, the Trojans wasted no time in completing the sweep. Wang and sophomore Rob Bellamy defeated Mertens and Shibahara 6-0. The tandem of Crystal and Farren took down Pham and Hammel 6-2 to win the doubles point and clinch the Trojans’ 7-0 victory. Senior Roberto Quiroz and freshman Tanner Smith were narrowly trailing Agbayani and Jonathan Poon 5-6 before the match was suspended as a result of the rain.
“I’m proud of all my teammates’ effort,” Quiroz said. “We’ve been training really hard, we’ve been taking care of our bodies really well. Those little things that you have to take care of — we’re doing them very well, so I think that’s our key and that’s why we’re succeeding that much this early in the season.”
With the victory, the Trojans move to 6-0 overall on the season and continue to gain early-season momentum in the quest to defend their NCAA title. Though the May NCAA playoffs remain far off, the reigning champions have gone undefeated in convincing fashion — through six games, the Trojans have defeated their opponents by a combined-points margin of    30-3.
Quiroz emphasized how he and his team are taking none of the early-season competitions for granted.
“It’s funny, all my career I focused on the end of the season, but now that it’s my last season, it’s tough,” Quiroz said. “So I’m enjoying every day, just trying to get better every day and working as hard as I can. I think that’s also why we’re succeeding, because we’re thinking one day at a time and just taking care of business.”
Next, the Trojans will head to Chicago, Illinois from Feb. 13 to Feb. 16 to take part in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoor Championships, a tournament that features the top 16 teams in the nation; their first opponent has yet to be determined. The Trojans were able to claim their spot in the competition with 4-0 victories against both Louisiana and Santa Clara on Jan. 23 and 24.
Following the Indoor Championships, the Trojans will return to Marks Stadium to face Stanford and Tulsa on Feb. 27 and 28.

John Oliver doesn’t look like a late night host. He doesn’t have the easy charm that they all seem to possess. He’s hilarious — there’s no question about that — but he’s got a base coat of awkward nerdiness. When it was announced that he would be leaving the Daily Show to start his own news comedy program, it was hard to imagine him carving out a niche competing against the dual colossus of John Stewart and Stephen Colbert. Yes, he had generated hosting buzz while filling in for Stewart while the longtime Daily Show host took eight weeks off to direct Rosewater in mid-2013. But that buzz was about him eventually replacing Stewart, not going head to head against him — not to mention the cultural phenomenon that was The Colbert Report.
Riding the wave from his successful summer run, in December 2013 HBO announced that Oliver would host Last Week Tonight. A weekly show that, while not competing with the other two shows for the same daily timeslot, would certainly provide vastly similar content to what Stewart and Colbert had produced to earn the previous 12 consecutive Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series. When he started, however, it quickly became apparent that this new model — only running once a week and unencumbered by corporate sponsorships by being on HBO — was not only unique enough to justify its existence but consistently great enough that it eclipsed The Daily Show in terms of Q-rating seemingly overnight. The once-a-week timeslot allowed writers to pick and choose only the biggest stories and polish their jokes to perfection, while The Daily Show was constrained to living up to its name and putting on a show every night, whether there was good material on any given day or not. The lack of concern about corporate interests was also a big factor. It was extremely freeing. All of a sudden the ability of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report to push the envelope on what their sponsors would allow was not enough. It is no longer cool to push the limit when your competition has no limits. In two years, Jon Stewart and The Daily Show had gone from a 10-consecutive-Emmy media giant to outdated. Comedy Central was surely kicking itself.
The channel’s heart must have sank when the supremely talented Colbert finally outgrew them and accepted the tall task of replacing David Letterman on CBS’s The Late Show, incidentally, the last variety show to win the Emmy before the Comedy Central onslaught way back in 2002. They had groomed the perfect successor to Colbert in Oliver, and they had let him slip away. They were left with the solid, but recently unspectacular Stewart and a soon-to-be-empty 11:30 timeslot. Last Week Tonight premiered 17 days after Colbert’s exit was announced. Two weeks, and lots of speculation, later Colbert’s successor was announced: Larry Wilmore. Like Colbert, Wilmore has been a longtime correspondent on the Daily Show talent farm. Unlike Colbert, Wilmore is only very talented instead of a preternaturally gifted cultural lightning rod. The Nightly Show, née The Minority Report, is quite good. But in replacing a show as universally beloved as The Colbert Report, it was almost understood that it would suffer in comparison to the Colbert experience, at least at first. The Nightly Show is thankfully not trying to be the Report. Gone is the satirical spirit and the host playing an over-the-top character every night. No, the Nightly Show is much closer to its daily counterpart in spirit. Its tone is more serious, about as serious as a show on Comedy Central can be. Wilmore is a fine host, but if Oliver doesn’t look like a typical late night host, then Wilmore is even further from the archetype. He’s no Colbert, that’s a given. But compared to Wilmore’s friendly uncle looks, Oliver is Steve McQueen. Given their relatively close premiere dates and their shared Daily Show roots, Oliver’s and Wilmore’s shows will inevitably be measured against each other. So far, it’s not close. Wilmore’s show is relatively new, even compared to Last Week Tonight, so perhaps it needs more time to gain traction. But it certainly is not evoking the same feeling of a meteoric rise that Last Week Tonight generated.
Perhaps it is a result of the HBO-induced freedom, but Oliver is much closer to Colbert’s free-wheeling spirit than Wilmore could ever hope to be. In Last Week Tonight’s midseason finale, he was already able to work in a gag where he used a salmon cannon to launch fish at the faces of famous faces of the likes of Stewart, Colbert, Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Tom Hanks and even Homer Simpson. Those are the farcical heights that will likely never be reached on Wilmore’s show, which is straightforward, informative and his panels have started some very interesting conversations. But no one is racing to share the latest poignant point that was brought up by Bill Burr on The Nightly Show.
Ultimately, in the modern late night game, what really matters is creating shareable moments that get shared all over the Internet. Fallon is a master of this with his endless games with celebrities. Jimmy Kimmel and Colbert also routinely made the rounds with their buzz-producing clips. Oliver was quickly a master of making clips that generated that kind of buzz. But where Fallon needs lip-sync battles to make the rounds, Oliver doesn’t (salmon cannon notwithstanding). The videos being shared from Last Week Tonight are routinely 8- to 10-minute-long marathons of Oliver dissecting a hot news topic and expertly extracting all the comedic juice from it while at the same time being extremely informative about the matter at hand. Oliver is getting views by lecturing. In our attention-deprived media environment, that is insane. It’s a testament of the strength of the Last Week Tonight model. Oliver has managed to meld the farce of Colbert with compelling, incisive analysis. Now that it is back from hiatus, The Nightly Show will probably fall further back in its formidable shadow. He might not look the part, but Oliver is seeming more and more like the new king of variety TV.
Daniel Grzywacz is a senior majoring in anthropology and neuroscience. He is also the lifestyle editor at the Daily Trojan. His column, “The Showbiz Must Go On,” runs Mondays.
I must admit I was hooked on Last Week Tonight from the first show.  John Oliver is very good at presenting the story then executing a good analysis of that story.

Students walking by University Gatweay on Friday were greeted by a line leaving a distinctly orange-colored new store. Such was the frenzy that the newly opened Blaze Pizza’s free pizza day caused among USC students.
In August 2012, Elsie and Rick Wetzel commenced plans to open Blaze Fast Fire’d Pizza in Irvine and Pasadena. Since then, the restaurant chain has expanded throughout the nation, with a grand opening of a location under University Gateway — convenient enough for USC students. The nation’s leading build-your-own pizza chain shows no signs of slowing down.
Before even opening its doors, Blaze Pizza on Figueroa Street took to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to reach out to USC students and inform, captivating their attention with mention of a free pizza day. Such promotion resulted in a massive turnout of hungry, avid pizza lovers on both opening night and free pizza day.
“Blaze Pizza is a fast, casual place so it does well with the millennials, our target generation to market to,” co-manager and director of new restaurant openings Vivian Neubauer said.
A location at one of the nation’s top universities seemed ideal to the restaurant chain. Much of the restaurant’s convenience comes from its proximity to University Park campus and its culture of fast pizza service. For over a year, Blaze Pizza has eyed the Figueroa Street location. It was not until last July, after months of communicating with Gateway, that the lease was officially signed.
The premise of Blaze Pizza is quite simple: quality pizza that is quickly accessible to college students looking for a casual meal.
Some might compare the Blaze Pizza experience to that of nearby Pizza Studio, also on Figueroa Street, in that both feature an interactive assembly line. The customers have the freedom of creating a pizza appropriate to their own tastes, or customizing a signature pizza from the menu. A wide assortment of delectable, fresh toppings is set before the customer. Once the customer is satisfied with their thin crust pizza, the pizza is placed in a flaming-hot open oven and ready for enjoyment in a matter of 180 seconds. Among Blaze Pizza’s menu options are gluten-free dough and vegan cheese. The 11-inch pizzas are sold for just under $8, affordable for the college student.
As for the ingredients, Neubauer stressed the importance of remaining eco-friendly while offering a product that is nothing short of high quality.
The pizzas available are good, but not spectacular. The ingredients are fresh but the ability to offer so many choices and turn around and quickly present a prepared pizza means that no one will mistake the pizzas for gourmet fare. The quality in taste compared to other, more crafted pizzas is about the same as the difference between a Chipotle burrito to one from a restaurant which has spent time on a specific recipe. Choice is Blaze’s appeal but it also hamstrings the ceiling to its quality.
Though most Blaze Pizza restaurants are equipped with similar, upbeat, orange decor, this Blaze Pizza is unique to its location. If the interior cardinal and gold decor or USC logo were not convincing enough, Blaze Pizza does not shy away from its Trojan pride. In fact, the restaurant plans to engage with USC beyond providing the ideal meal.
Among this restaurant’s vision is an plan to give back to the community. When asked about future goals for this particular restaurant, Neubauer revealed plans to play an active role with on-campus organizations in plans of benefiting others.
“We definitely want to be connected with the school as much as we can,” Neubauer said. “We try to get in with school organizations. We want to start fundraisers where we give 20 percent back to any organizations that come in and set up with us.”
Blaze Pizza’s customer satisfaction efforts might not always be easy, but the intentions and ambition for Blaze Pizza to give back seem difficult to match and ultimately set the restaurant apart from other off-campus dining options.
“It is all about saying ‘yes’ to the guests; we don’t ever want to say no. It’s all about making the guests smile. We just want to be really friendly and make sure that everyone does say ‘thank you’ because it sure does go a long way,” said Neubauer.
Blaze Pizza is open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. from Sunday through Thursday and 11 a.m. to midnight on Friday and Saturday. The restaurant is located at 3335 S. Figueroa St, in the University Gateway building near CVS.
“Give us a chance,” Neubauer suggests. From its promotion to Neubauer’s enthusiasm, Blaze Pizza seems just as happy to immerse itself within the Trojan family as Trojans are happy about its opening.

Crusaders for public health have long touted, “everything in moderation.” We’re told to limit our fats, sugars and amount of time we spend inert on the couch watching Netflix. But in our push for improved fitness and reduced mortality, we’ve overlooked an essential cause for self-restraint, and the consequences could be lethal. The excessive use of antibiotics has committed the human race to a war on all fronts, with our microscopic adversaries wielding an eons-old tactic that we’ve yet to best: evolution. As superbugs resistant to medicine proliferate globally, it is of immediate importance that companies and governments work to curb their spread by loosening our reliance on unnecessary antibiotics.
Celebrated as one of the greatest medical advancements of the 20th century, antibiotics work by killing or inhibiting the growth of bacteria responsible for life-threatening infections. Prior to World War II, standard practice for the treatment of skin infections was amputation of the affected areas. Even an injury as superficial as a small scrape — today merely acknowledged with some ointment and a Band-Aid — could mean death if the wound became a site for infection. So it really is no wonder that mid-century commentators heralded antibiotics as “wonder drugs.”
Today, we take for granted the availability of antibiotics, offered over the counter in gel, spray and wipe form. We seek out prescriptions from our physicians for every cold and flu, viruses that cannot be treated by antibiotics, despite the fact that half of all antibiotic prescriptions are written for such ailments. When traveling to foreign countries we take antibiotics without proper cause.  In developing nations like India, the flooding of immune systems with antimicrobial serums starts on day one, with newborns receiving injections to safeguard them against pathogens.
The problem goes beyond just pharmacies and doctors’ offices. In fact, nearly 80 percent of all antibiotics used in the United States go toward commercial farm animals. Intended to promote growth and prevent sickness in highly crowded facilities, these unsustainable practices have given a boost to superbug advancement. The FDA has introduced guidelines encouraging the end of indiscriminate antibiotic use by farmers. But because these regulations are voluntary, their adoption has been scant.
So, what’s the big deal?
Over many decades of exposure to the same antibiotics, microbes have developed a resistance.  The ubiquity of bacteria — hundreds of trillions living in a single human body — yields  a high probability of random genetic mutation. Most of the time, a mutation will result in a bacterium’s death. Occasionally though, a mutation will give a cell some competitive advantage. In the race against medicine, this advantage can take the form of cell walls toughened against powerful drugs and the capacity to transfer drug-resistant genes to other, non-resistant microbes. While the antibiotic goes to work killing off susceptible organisms, it is also clearing the way for the emergence of these resistant superbugs.
Bacteria are ultimately compelled by their will to live. Each new generation of a strain, emerging every couple of hours or so, grows stronger against modern antibiotics. In some cases, even those most powerful drugs have proved futile. In a 2013 report, the Centers for Disease Control found that superbugs sicken at least two million Americans annually, 23,000 cases which result in death. In a global survey conducted last year, the World Health Organization reached similar conclusions.
Engineering our way out of the problem seems a risky venture. It has been decades since a new class of antibiotics was introduced. Much of this has to do with the lack of economic incentive for pharmaceutical companies. Research invested in long-term drugs for the treatment of chronic conditions such as cancer is a far more lucrative endeavor than the generation of new antibiotics intended for brief use.
There is some hope. A report published last month in Nature details the promising findings of several researchers in Massachusetts.  Using a compound called teixobactin, which is secreted by soil-dwelling bacteria, the scientists have found promising treatment against the microbes responsible for many infections. The best part? Because the teixobactin attaches to parts of the cell wall that can’t mutate, the bacteria under assault, might be unable to evolve a resistance. Still, this science is in its most preliminary phase.
Behavioral modifications — that is, using fewer antibiotics across all sectors — seem to be the most appropriate step in preventing superbug emergence. With the next class of viable antibiotics still years shy of entering healthcare systems, reduction will prove more successful than a frantic arms race.

On Jan. 27, President Barack Obama announced plans to ban oil drilling in 12 million acres of Alaskan land. Environmental activists interpreted the announcement as a clear step forward in the fight against climate change. This step forward, however, was accompanied by a step back: the Obama administration also proposed opening up waters near the East Coast to offshore drilling, pleasing local Republicans who believe it will provide a boost to the economy.
The region spans the Atlantic Ocean from Virginia to Georgia. Opening the East Coast waters to drilling is part of the Interior Department’s new five-year plan, which will allow the government to lease federal waters for oil and gas development from 2017 until 2022.
This resulted in a confusing message from the Obama administration that seemed to simultaneously denounce and encourage oil production. To some, the plan aims to both preserve the environment and appease Republicans. However, Obama’s plan for Atlantic drilling holds our nation back in the fight against climate change, which Obama himself dubbed the “greatest threat to future generations” in his 2015 State of the Union address.
If Obama really believes this, his policy decisions should follow it. He can achieve this by opposing new oil production sites, instead of allowing the oil industry to grow at a time it should be shrinking. Obama’s attempt to please both the oil industry and his political opposition, albeit a noble move, will not efficiently address climate change.
This isn’t the first time the Obama administration considered using East Coast waters for oil production. In 2010, in another example of Obama’s tendency to couple environmental policy with Republican appeasement, the Interior Department proposed the first five-year plan for oil development in the region, while the president introduced a climate change bill to the Senate. The Interior Department’s plan, however, was scrapped after the notorious British Petroleum oil spill.
The plan’s timing was not right in 2010, and it still isn’t right now. The BP spill was the worst oil spill in United States history; it leaked more than 200 million gallons of oil. Memories of the spill leave many people wary to support the initiation of offshore oil drilling, and rightfully so — no new regulations have been implemented to reduce the risk of future disasters of similar nature.
Opening new areas to offshore drilling creates opportunities for environmental damage. Even if risk of another oil spill is low, oil production and consumption threatens our environment. According to the CIA, oil as a source of energy is responsible for more than 5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. If Obama is serious about combating climate change, curbing this number would be a good place to start.
Obama’s plan is not only unethical, it is unnecessary. Experts say that between public hearings, logistic and revisions, it would most likely be at least 10 years before oil is actually drilled off of the East Coast.  The CIA projects that in 10 years, oil demand will be down by three million barrels a day. This projection calls into question whether we should or need to increase offshore drilling.
Hopefully, 10 years from now, we will use less oil and eliminate the need to access new sources.
It’s time to stop using oil like a crutch. It’s time to give alternative energy sources more credibility. It’s time to get serious about climate change.
Obviously, people will still need oil. Even the most stringent environmentalists would agree that oil production cannot be halted. New production, however, can, which allows the nation to drag out its breakup with oil until we can survive without it.
Obama cannot be afraid to take a stance against climate change, even if it means failing to appease Republicans after a new environmental policy announcement.
A recent New York Times survey revealed that 83 percent of Americans, including 61 percent of Republicans, believe that global warming will become a very or somewhat serious problem in the future. The American public is on the same side as Obama and Earth.
With this in mind, Obama should use the rest of his term to do as much as he can to stop climate change to set an example for both future presidents and the nation as a whole.
“Unchecked climate change will pose unacceptable risks to our security, our economies and our plane,” Obama said during the 2009 Copenhagen climate change conference.
Opening new areas to drilling definitely won’t “check” climate change. Obama’s talked the talk against climate change, but he needs to walk the walk. It’s impossible to fight climate change while increasing the very actions which cause it.
The USA has natural resources that the people of the USA and world want and will pay for. The USA has the strictest environmental laws in the world. It would be well for the USA to expand drilling throughout all its territories. Selling rights to drill is one way to fund federal spending. I prefer the selling of drilling rights to the taxing of incomes.
