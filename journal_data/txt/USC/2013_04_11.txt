The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary on Wednesday, April 10. 
Miscellaneous incidents
at 10:54 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of four people trapped in an elevator in the Seeley G. Mudd Building. An elevator mechanic subsequently arrived on the scene and freed the subjects without incident.
at 10:15 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a student behaving erratically at the Annenberg House and, upon arrival, observed him running up and down the street shouting incoherently. The student was physically restrained by the officers because of his combative behavior and a Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance unit was requested. RA Unit #15 responded and examined the student, then transported him to California Hospital for medical treatment.
at 7:44 p.m., DPS officers responded to a patient that tripped and fell outside the Keck Hospital of USC. DPS officers were unable to contact the patient to ascertain if she sustained any injuries because she was scheduled for surgery unrelated to the fall.
at 4:57 p.m., a student reported that he agreed to purchase two subscriptions from two suspects who came to his door selling magazines for a contest. The student later conducted his own investigation of the company offering the magazines and after determining that it was a scam, he stopped payment on the checks he had written.
at 4:28 p.m., DPS officers responded to a report of a student and her boyfriend involved in an altercation at the Parkside Apartments and detained them for questioning. Both of the subjects stated that the altercation was verbal only and the officers observed no visible signs of injury to either of them. The student and her boyfriend were then released and the officers cleared the scene.
at 1:54 p.m., a student was cited to Judicial Affairs for uncooperative behavior with Los Angeles Police Department officers who detained him for a traffic violation on 30th and Orchard streets.
You got love the fool that calls DPS after ordering magazine subscriptions from door-to-door salespeople.  Next time give them you credit card to complete the trifecta of stupidity.

Students and faculty dedicated a tree and plaque Thursday during a memorial service in honor of the one-year anniversary of the murders of Ming Qu and Ying Wu, two Chinese international Viterbi School of Engineering graduate students.
Remembrance · A memorial outside the Seaver Science Library honors graduate students in electrical engineering Ying Wu and Ming Qu, who were killed west of University Park Campus on April 11, 2012. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The memorial took place around Viterbi’s new Chinese bauhinia blakeana tree, which was planted in honor of Qu and Wu. Members of the university’s administration, the Dean of Religious Life and the president of the Chinese Students and Scholars Association spoke during the service.
At the base of the tree is a plaque that reads “In memory of Ming Qu and Ying Wu” in English and reads “May they rest in peace”  in Mandarin.
Qu and Wu, both 23 years old, were shot dead in a car west of the University Park Campus on April 11, 2012. Bryan Barnes and Javier Bolden were charged last May with first-degree murder in connection to the case.
Provost and Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett stood in front of the tree, telling attendees to not remember what the USC community lost in their passing, but to remember what we gained in the way that the students lived.
“While their lives were tragically cut short, their drives in many ways were achieved,” Garrett said. “They still inspire all of us to follow their examples by pursuing those possibilities that make us the most happy, the most productive and the most fulfilled.”
Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis C. Yortsos said the tragedy hit him very deeply on several levels, as he is  a former international student and is now a Viterbi parent. Yortsos said he hopes the new tree, with pink petals resembling hearts, can provide a positive place to reflect.
“I like to imagine in the months and years to come our students and faculty will … pause and think under the heart-shaped flowers and be peaceful,” Yortsos said. “That, in truth, is our greatest debt to our absent friends: to live deliberately, to revel in the possibilities of every moment.”
Yortsos said the university will establish the Ming Qu and Ying Wu Memorial Scholarship in their honor to support future generations of international students from China. Yortsos said the scholarship will academically assist and inspire Chinese students.
Biao Yang, a third-year electrical engineering graduate student and friend of Qu and Wu, said he was happy with the event’s turnout, because it let him know that Qu and Wu were still in many people’s thoughts. Yang said he looks forward to visiting the dedicated space on campus.
“When I come to school, I will come to see this tree every day,” Yang said. “This tree will help me very much. It’s beautiful. It will let me think of many things with them.”
Amy Xhao, an electrical engineering graduate student, said the tree will not only serve to honor the students but also serve as a reminder to prioritize community safety as much as possible.
“I think this should help out the students and the faculty from the university to learn from this,” Xhao said, “and prevent anything bad in the future, and that’s more important.”
Yifan Zhu, a first-year graduate student in journalism, said the memorial service will have a lasting impact for future students.
“This has made a dent on the university’s history,” Zhu said. “So having this tree and plaque will help students coming long after know from the moment they decide to come to USC that we all really have to be careful and spread awareness to make this whole environment better.”
Though the memorial service highlighted other changes in campus security policy made by the university since Qu and Wu’s deaths, the focus of the service largely remained on the students’ memory. Yortsos, in particular, spoke of them endearingly.
“To Ming and Ying: We miss you, we cherish you, and we are truly honored to honor you,” Yortsos said.

RIP….but cheesy, hackneyed cliches such as “a reminder to prioritize community safety” should be replaced by action. Action such as building more on-campus and/or walking-distance housing for grad students and even undergrads is what’s needed. These two students lived about a mile northwest of campus, if I recall correctly.They “chose” to live that far away because there isn’t much affordable housing closer.  Essentially, south, west, east, northwest of campus is dangerous; north of campus, south of Adams, west of the 110, and east of Vermont is generally “safe.”  All these newly built, glamorous, high rise luxury apartments (up and down Fig from Exposition to Adams) are nice, if SC wants to play “90210 the College Years” by perpetuating its image as the U.niversity of S.poiled C.hildren, whose mommies & daddies got them in because of legacy…But if SC wants to build its reputation as a world class research institute that attracts international students a la the Ivies…or even that school across town, then at least make the physical environment as safe as possible. It’s no secret that 90007 is a rough urban area. 
BTW, that chain linked fence is soooo cheesy.

Tsai’s gift is part of the Campaign for the University of Southern California, a multiyear effort to fundraise $6 billion to support USC academics and grow the university’s impact on the community and the world.
“The ability to accelerate the time between scientific discovery and new patient therapies is a core focus of USCs medical enterprise,” President C. L. Max Nikias said in a statement. “With his generous gift, Daniel Tsai affirms his confidence in our ability to do so.”
In recognition of the donation, a laboratory in the John Stauffer Pharmaceutical Sciences Center on the Health Sciences Campus will be named in honor of Tsai.
Researchers at the center will focus on the development of pharmaceuticals to target monoamine oxidase (MAO), an enzyme suspected to hinder the spread of cancer. Jean Chen Shih, a professor in the School of Pharmacy and an expert in monoamine signaling, will lead the center.
The new center will be jointly based at USC and in Taiwan. The two facilities will exchange research findings, and fellows at the center will also spend up to two years training in laboratories.
Tsai, who was elected to the USC Board of Trustees in April 2012, is the chairman of Fubon Financial, the largest financial group in Taiwan. During his time on the board, Tsai has actively supported USC outreach in Asia.
“I believe international collaborations between expert researchers are one of the keys to developing new ways to treat disease,” Tsai said in a statement. “I am proud to support USC and, in particular, the work of Dr. Shih to ensure these collaborations take place.”
Tsai is a graduate of National Taiwan University and Georgetown University. His wife, Irene, received a master’s degree from the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in 1985. Three of Tsai’s children currently attend USC.

Gates is the former principal dancer with the Joffrey Ballet, Frankfurt Ballet and the Pennsylvania Ballet. Gates has also choreographed a number of works for classical ballet companies.
Gates is an associate professor of dance at the University of California, Irvine.
She has received numerous awards for her dedication in the field, including honors from the American Association of University Women and the Jerome Robbins New Essential Works Program. Gates has also created more than 40 works of her own.
Robert A. Cutietta, the current dean of the Thornton School of Music who will serve as the future dean of the Kaufman School of Dance, said Gates has many unique qualities that will be assets to the school.
“What really impresses me is that she has had a fabulous career as a dancer and went on to have a fabulous career as an educator,” Cutietta said. “She understands art, understands education and can put together something that has existed before, and that’s what we’re doing here.”
Cutietta said Gates’ dance festival is an example of her creative traits. The Laguna Dance Festival, a non-profit organization founded in 2005 and run by Gates, gathers dance companies from across the nation to perform in various venues around Laguna Beach.
The school, in addition to the Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center, is slated to open in the fall semester of 2015.
In November 2012, philanthropist Glorya Kaufman provided the endowment to create the school. The dance school is the first school at the university to be established in the past 40 years. It is also the sixth endowed school dedicated to the arts, joining the schools of architecture, cinematic arts, dramatic arts, fine arts and music.
Kaufman said she was pleased with Gates becoming the director.
“Jodie Gates is the perfect person for the job,” Kaufman said in a statement. “She is keenly aware of the unique needs of a dancer and the importance of a first-rate curriculum.”
University officials also expressed excitement not only about the school’s establishment but also  about Gates’ appointment, noting her extensive experience.
“Glorya Kaufman’s transformational gift has added the beauty of dance to USC’s expressive range,” Provost Elizabeth Garrett said in a statement. “With the addition of celebrated artist Jodie Gates to the Kaufman School’s leadership team, the pieces are in place to complete USC’s arts mosaic.”
A committee of faculty members from various schools across the university selected Gates to serve as director.
Gates will begin her position in August. According to the Los Angeles Times, her official title will be vice dean and director of the USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance. She will also have the academic title of professor.

USC has hired hall of famer and former Woman of Troy Cynthia Cooper-Dyke as its new women’s basketball head coach, Athletic Director Pat Haden announced Thursday.

Cooper-Dyke, who as a player helped lead USC to a pair of NCAA championships before winning an Olympic gold medal and four WNBA titles, looks to restore the winning tradition of the USC women’s basketball program.
“In Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, we have a proven winning coach who happens to be a USC basketball icon,” Haden said in a statement. “She was a part of the best basketball ever played here at USC, and she seen success at so many levels of the game. As a coach she has turned around several programs. We believe she can lead USC back to successful women’s basketball, and we welcome her back to the USC campus.”
Cooper-Dyke, 49, has an eight-year collegiate head coaching record of 150-106 (.586), with seven postseason appearances and three league coach-of-the-year awards.
“If you were to ask me what my dream job was at any point in my coaching career, I would always have said my dream is to come back and lead the USC women’s basketball team,” Cooper-Dyke said in a statement. “I’m literally living the dream coming back to California and being named the new women’s basketball coach at USC.”
She takes over a squad that went 11-20 overall and finished seventh in the Pac-12 under fourth-year head coach Michael Cooper, who resigned last month (the two coaches are not related).
“I’m very excited to coach every one of these USC players,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I’m excited about the talent we have. I’m excited to teach and learn and motivate and really see them blossom into the players they can truly become.”
Prior to coming to USC, Cooper-Dyke was head coach at Texas Southern University and resurrected the Lady Tigers’ program, taking a 5-26 team and leading them in her first year to a 16-2 league mark and their first-ever Southwestern Athletic Conference regular season title.
Before the stint at Texas Southern, she spent two seasons as the head coach at UNC Wilmington, where her team not only set a school record for victories with a 24-9 mark, but made its first ever post-season appearance.
Cooper-Dyke began her college coaching career at Prairie View A&M, where she posted an 86-72 record with four postseason appearances during her five-year (2006-10) tenure there.
“I want to thank my coaching staffs and all the players I’ve coached,” Cooper-Dyke said. “The players are always in the forefront of everything we do. It’s about helping these women grow and succeed in this world. As a coach, you can’t be successful without your players believing in you and performing to the best of their abilities. I wouldn’t be here without them.”
Cooper-Dyke is one of the most decorated players to ever play women’s basketball. She won the 1981 L.A. city player of the year award at Locke High in Los Angeles, was named an All-Conference first teamer and made the NCAA All-tournament team as the Women of Troy advanced to the NCAA Final. At the professional level, she led the WNBA’s Houston Comets to a record four consecutive WNBA championships (1997-2000), being named WNBA Finals MVP each time.
She was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999, the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009 and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010, in the latter becoming the first WNBA player to do so. At USC, she currently ranks ninth on the school’s all-time scoring list (1,559 points), eighth in assists (381) and third in steals (256).
“I want to thank Pat Haden and Donna Heinel and the entire Trojan Family for giving me this awesome opportunity,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I don’t take it lightly. I feel like the different programs I’ve been a part of…have prepared me in many ways for the Pac-12 and USC…I can’t promise it will happen in a year like it did at these other programs, but I promise we will put forth our best effort as a staff to create a program that embraces the work ethic and mentality that will help us be successful.”
 
“The ability to accelerate the time between scientific discovery and new patient therapies is a core focus of USC’s medical enterprise,” said USC President C. L. Max Nikias. “With his generous gift, Daniel Tsai affirms his confidence in our ability to do so.

The USC women’s water polo team takes on Stanford at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center this Saturday. The two powerhouse teams promises to be a nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat thriller that is sure to live up to the hype.
The contest will pit USC, the No. 1 team in the nation, against No. 2 Stanford in only their second matchup since last year’s national championship game, when the Cardinal took the title from the Women of Troy in a 6-4 defensive struggle.
USC hasn’t forgotten about that game, as proven on Feb. 24 of this year, when the Women of Troy outlasted the Cardinal in an emotional 13-10 battle to win the UCI Invitational Tournament.
“We have rivalries with all of the top four schools,” junior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist said, “but I think [Stanford] is definitely up there because they beat us in the national championship game and they’ve beaten us a lot, so we have a big rivalry.”
With both of the schools’ track records for scoring — USC leads the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation with 15.8 goals per game and Stanford is a close second at 14.0 goals per game — nobody would be surprised if Saturday turned into another shootout.
The goalies of Saturday’s matchup, however, might have something to say about that. The top three goalies in the MPSF hail from these two teams, as freshman Gabby Stone and senior Kate Baldoni of Stanford have combined to allow only 4.25 goals per game. In addition, USC’s junior goalie Flora Bolonyai has allowed only 87 goals in an impressive 72 quarters of play.
As talented as Bolonyai is, she will be relying on the rest of the USC defense to come up big on Saturday.
“We really need to be focused when we’re playing defense,” Bolonyai said. “They have really good offensive players, so it’s important that we know their tendencies and that we know their possible weaknesses.”
Every team has weaknesses, but they are fairly difficult to find on this Stanford offense. Featuring the MVP of the London Olympics, freshman Maggie Steffens, and last season’s NCAA MVP winner, sophomore Kiley Neushul, the Cardinal offensive attack is a force to be reckoned with.
“They have really dangerous center players,” USC head coach Jovan Vavic said. “Good centers create problems inside. They have gold medalists who play center inside, and both are very strong and play well.”
The USC offensive is not without its own weapons, however, as the Women of Troy make up a sizeable chunk of the top 25 scorers in the MPSF. Leading the charge is sophomore Monica Vavic, who is putting up impressive numbers this season. Monica Vavic leads the MPSF in goals per game with 2.95, scoring 59 goals in only 20 games. By comparison, Stanford’s top scorer, senior Melissa Seidemann, has scored four fewer goals in four more games.
The key to the Trojan offense is its unpredictability, as any player can score from any spot in the pool at any time. Using an offense that capitalizes on fast breaks down the pool and quick passes from their perimeter offense, Jovan Vavic knows the value of the amount of scorers on his team.
“It’s our strength,” Jovan Vavic said. “You can’t focus on any one of our players.”
Another factor that might swing the contest in USC’s favor is the location, as Saturday’s game will be the third and final home game for the squad. It will also be senior night for the Women of Troy, as the team will celebrate the careers of graduating seniors Constance Hiller, Nicolina McCall, Blair Moody, Dominique Sardo and Chelsea Silvers. In front of their home crowd, expect an energized and refreshed team to take the pool in Los Angeles.
“It’s always nice to play at home,” Vavic said. “There are familiar surroundings, and we don’t have to travel. Our fans, family members and players from our men’s team will be there.”
The fans in attendance on Saturday will be treated not only to the pageantry of senior night but also to a thrilling match, as the Women of Troy attempt to remain the lone undefeated team in the nation. The game begins at 4 p.m.

This weekend marks the final tournaments of the regular season for USC’s men’s and women’s golf teams.
The No. 1 Women of Troy travel to Tempe, Ariz., for the PING/ASU Invitational beginning Friday and they hope to win their fourth consecutive team event.
After opening the spring season with a second-place finish at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge, the squad has rattled off wins at the Allstate Sugar Bowl, the Bruin Wave Invitationals and last week’s SDSU Farms Invitational.
It was at last week’s event that the team turned in its most dominant performance of the season: Junior Sophia Popov won her record-tying fifth individual title, while three other Women of Troy placed in the top five on the way to a 30-stroke team victory.
This weekend’s action is sure to be a tougher challenge for the nation’s top squad. The 17-team field will include host No. 15 ASU, defending NCAA champion No. 2 Alabama, No. 6 Arizona, No. 4 Duke, No. 14 Stanford, No. 16 Texas, No. 8 UCLA and No. 10 Washington.
USC head coach Andrea Gaston knows full well the significance of this event.
“This tournament is almost a preview of NCAAs,” Gaston said. “Many of the top-ranked teams will be here competing.”
Fortunately, the team has had success in this tournament in the past — a team win at ASU in 2008 was part of a streak of four straight wins that ended in a national title. Gaston has confidence this team can match that record and compete on a national stage.
“Our team has been working hard to prepare, and we’ve had some great success on this course,” Gaston said. “Hopefully, we’ll put ourselves in position to win.”
Meanwhile, the No. 7 men’s golf team will travel up the coast to Santa Cruz this weekend for the two-day Western Intercollegiate Tournament hosted by San Jose State. Beginning Saturday, the squad will face off with the likes of top-ranked California, No. 4 Washington and No. 9 Stanford at Pasatiempo Golf Course.
The Trojans are coming off two consecutive rough outings by their standards and have not had a top-five finish since their victory at the North Ranch Intercollegiate in late February. Still, the team has vast potential and knows it can compete with the best in the country.
The emergence of senior Sam Smith has been crucial to the Trojans keeping their high ranking. USC’s most experienced golfer has paced the team at their last two events, while younger players have struggled.
If freshman Yi Keun Chang and sophomore Anthony Paolucci can return to their early season form, the team will be in good shape for the upcoming postseason tournaments. Head coach Chris Zambri is confident, but he also knows the challenges of this course.
“Pasatiempo is incredible. The course requires skill in all areas of the game,” Zambri said. “I am looking forward to seeing how the team performs.”
The men will take two weeks off after returning from Santa Cruz to practice for the ultra-tough                   Pac-12 tournament and the NCAA regionals. Zambri is aware of how a tournament like this weekend’s can prepare his team for the postseason.
“[This weekend] will be a great litmus test for where our team is headed into the postseason,” Zambri said.
Both of this weekend’s tournaments can be followed live at golfstat.com.

It seems like just yesterday I was writing about the 2012 spring game. National championship hopes were high, as was talk about a Heisman Trophy for Matt Barkley. The stars were aligned for the Trojans, to say the least.
A year later, things couldn’t be more different.
There is no quarterback certainty. There aren’t really Bowl Championship Series title hopes, either. The 2013 spring game will be an adventure of sorts for the fans that choose to go or watch it on the Pac-12 Network.
Just because most of the stars aren’t back from last year’s squad doesn’t mean the game won’t be worth watching, though. Positions are up for grabs, and this game is where some young players’ careers might take off. Here are five things to look for come game time.
Quarterback quandary
Though most casual USC fans believe the starting spot is a race between redshirt sophomore Max Wittek and true freshman Max Browne, there is a third name to keep in mind: Cody Kessler. His chances of getting the job aren’t great, but when Wittek was injured earlier in the spring, Kessler got some extra reps, as did Browne. Look for one of the quarterbacks to put his fingerprint on the team.
And though the job won’t be won Saturday, a good effort unhindered by turnovers could go a long way in deciding things.
Wide receivers, please stand up
The Trojans took a major hit when wide receiver Robert Woods entered the NFL draft. They took another hit last week when junior George Farmer tore his ACL and MCL. After star junior Marqise Lee and standout sophomore Nelson Agholor, there are a lot of unproven commodities that will be forced to take the field.
Redshirt sophomore Victor Blackwell and freshman Darreus Rogers will all have a chance to make a move to become that third receiver. With Farmer out, it’s a pretty open race.
Cornerback woes
Last year, the cornerback position was a major concern for the Trojans. Other than Nickell Robey, the other spot was a revolving door all season. With Robey gone to the NFL, things are murkier than ever. Senior Torin Harris, who started much of last season, will likely get the nod on one side, though he had his ups and downs in 2012. On the other side will be either sophomore Kevon Seymour, junior Anthony Brown or freshmen Leon McQuay III or Chris Hawkins. The spring game could go a long way in deciding who’s going to get the first crack at the starting spot.
Play-calling duties
Head coach Lane Kiffin came out and said that he wasn’t sure who was going to be calling the plays come September. Clay Helton, the new offensive coordinator, served as quarterbacks coach last season.
Though Helton was promoted back in February, the jury is still out on who is going to ultimately call plays. Perhaps Saturday’s game can provide a little more insight into how things are going to look come fall.
How’s the new defensive alignment going to translate?
This is the million-dollar question in my eyes. Last season, the Trojans’ defense was porous, to say the least. They allowed 24.3 points per game (ranking No. 40 in the country) and allowed 28 points or more on five separate occasions, including a record-breaking 62 to Oregon at the Coliseum.
Defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin has since left for greener pastures in the NFL, and in his place now is Clancy Pendergast, who spent the last few seasons as California’s defensive coordinator. Pendergast is switching the Trojans from their traditional 4-3 alignment into a 3-4. That means that players like senior defensive end Morgan Breslin will have to adjust to playing linebacker and dropping back in coverage.
Sophomore Leonard Williams has been moved from tackle to end, which shouldn’t be a huge transition in the new scheme. However, such moves are just another thing to worry about. And in a conference that features offensive juggernauts such as the University of Oregon and the University of Arizona (though the Trojans wouldn’t face the Ducks unless they both made it to the  Pac-12 title game), there really isn’t a lot of time for the defense to get its feet wet. It’s going to have to learn on the fly.
Though this year’s spring game doesn’t feature the same sort of fanfare that last year’s did, there are still plenty of reasons to watch the game. There are a lot of uncertainties on this year’s squad. And that makes things more fun, to be honest.
We saw what happened last year when the stars were supposedly aligned; maybe this year will be different. If nothing else, Saturday is your last chance to see the Trojans before they head to Hawai’i for game No. 1 of 2013.

The USC men’s volleyball team concludes its season on Friday, squaring off against crosstown rival UCLA ahead of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation playoff tournament set to begin Saturday, April 20.
Last chance · Junior Tanner Jansen (above) and the Trojans have the opportunity to hurt UCLA’s seeding in the MPSF playoffs. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The 2013 campaign marks a drastic change of fortunes for the Trojans, who are on the outside of the playoff bubble after winning a berth in the NCAA championship game in 2012. The club has followed up last season’s 26-7 record with a disappointing 6-17 mark and is coming off a 3-1 loss to UC Santa Barbara on Wednesday (23-25, 19-25, 25-21, 17-25).
The Trojans were once again led by sophomore outside hitter Cristian Rivera, who notched 19 kills. Redshirt freshman outside hitter Austin Rysyk also reached double figures with 11 kills, while graduating senior libero J.B. Green added 12 digs in his second consecutive start.
However, USC was once again outdone in each of the major statistical categories, as the Gauchos registered significantly more blocks (16 to six) and digs (42 to 38) while hitting .259 to USC’s .135.
The loss marked the fourth consecutive time the Trojans lost their immediate game following a win, as they failed to capitalize upon a resounding 3-0 sweep of Cal State Northridge Saturday on senior night. USC head coach Bill Ferguson heaped considerable praise upon Green and setter Chris Trefzger, the team’s two seniors, whose presence in the starting lineup invigorated a struggling Trojan squad.
“Our team, player by player, has a ton of respect for them and rallied around them to play well,” Ferguson said. “It was the first time this season that all three pin attackers hit above .300. We had more service errors than I would have liked, but we generally served well and that allowed us to block and dig more.”
Though the losses of Trefzger and Green won’t affect the team as drastically as last year’s departures of All-Americans Tony Ciarelli and Steven Shandrick, Ferguson made no attempt to downplay the significance of senior night for his two seniors and their impact on the team’s performance.
“It’s always tough, especially with guys like J.B. and Chris, who do everything the right way and don’t get as many opportunities as the other guys,” Ferguson said. “Our team is better for having had those guys, and though they’re not on the floor as much, both I and the team have been better with those guys involved in our program.”
With a playoff spot already clinched, UCLA will look to improve its seeding, while the Trojans are left to play the role of spoiler to disrupt the Bruins’ game plan in whatever manner possible.
“We didn’t have great matchups against [UCSB and UCLA] the first time, and we were pretty beat up during that stretch,” Ferguson said. “We didn’t do well enough and as a group we can give them a better match.”
Regardless of the positioning of the match, Ferguson promises to have his guys ready to face a hard-charging UCLA squad.
“I always say that if you can’t get up for that match, you don’t have a pulse,” Ferguson said. “They’re fighting to be in the top half of the playoff bracket. We don’t have anything after that match, so it will keep us motivated and working hard so that we can continue the great rivalry.”
We don’t hear Coach Ferguson extoll any good comments about future Trojans who have been recruited for
next season to give some hope for a major turnaround. Sad ending to a bad, bad season. Always want to beat
the ‘ruins though so good luck to the players who should tune out the coaching staff and play fast and loose with
reckless abandon.

In a spring fraught with injuries and difficulty, the USC football team held its final spring practice before its annual spring scrimmage at the Coliseum on Saturday.

The Trojans practiced without kneepads for the second consecutive practice, but the diminished physicality didn’t detract from the intensity and speed of the drills.
Junior wide receiver Marqise Lee again had a field day working out against the young Trojan secondary, making his presence known through a variety of dazzling catches including a leaping two-handed grab amid a shroud of defenders in the end zone during situational drills.
The battle at quarterback heated up as redshirt sophomore quarterbacks Max Wittek and Cody Kessler looked neck and neck during passing drills. The two quarterbacks had somewhat differing approaches to Saturday’s exhibition matchup; predictably, incumbent starter Wittek appeared nonplussed and determined about his performance.
“Obviously it’s a shorter scrimmage, but [I’ll try to] make the plays that are there, make the open throws and don’t try to force anything,” Wittek said. “I don’t have to go out on the last day [of spring practice] and make a crazy splash in the competition or anything. I think the real body of work is the resume that I’ve put on film over the past 14 practices.”
Though Wittek’s throwing mechanics and ball velocity remain impressive, the redshirt sophomore has taken to improving other areas of his play this spring.
“Decision-making and timing, making those decisions in a quick manner,” Wittek said. “Not to throw it every play — the big play’s not going to be made on every down. To take off and run and check it down if I need to.”
Conversely, Kessler stuck around following practice and got in some practice snaps and extra throws on a practically deserted Howard Jones Field. Theoretically speaking, it is Kessler who has the most to gain from a strong showing Saturday. Though Wittek has made an impression in starts against Notre Dame and Georgia Tech last season, Kessler and his play have remained largely out of the auspices of the general public. Saturday will be his first chance to show the public at least a glimpse of his capabilities.
“You come in ready to compete,” Kessler said. “Even though it is intersquad, you approach it like it’s game day. It’s Saturday, it’s in the Coliseum; we’re going to have fans there; it’s going to be nice to play in front of them.”
Head coach Lane Kiffin was pleased, in particular, with his quarterbacks’ ability to take care of the ball — a positive sign after the Trojan quarterbacks combined for 20 interceptions last season.
“[The quarterbacks] have really limited turnovers in the Coliseum this spring, which is very different than last spring … [considering] how much we were turning the ball over especially at quarterback, so it’s been really good,” Kiffin said.
Saturday’s exhibition at the Coliseum, which begins at 1 p.m., probably won’t offer too many definitive answers regarding the depth chart — Kiffin’s post-spring depth chart will be released April 15 — but it will at least give the Trojan faithful and the public at large a clearer picture of the quarterback race.
Wittek made an impression you say. One good vs. ND, and one pretty bad vs. Ga. Tech in the Sun Bowl.
It was sad that Kessler was not given a chance to play in the Sun Bowl which falls on Coach Kiffin who is
the one that needs to make a new impression on the fans for the better.

Since launching Tuesday at 9:24 p.m., one Facebook page has already gained an impressive 3,600 likes with its glamour shots of the real stars of the University Park Campus’ immaculately manicured foliage: the squirrels.
USC Squirrels’ witty biographies and expertly curated photos come from one student who asked to remain anonymous. The Daily Trojan interviewed this chronicler of the cute rodents that frequent campus.
Nutty · USC Squirrels, which showcases the furry critters on campus, has received an overwhelmingly positive response among students. – Courtesy of USC Squirrels
 
Daily Trojan: Where did the idea to catalog the life of squirrels come from?
USC Squirrels: We’ve seen pictures of squirrels on a lot of people’s Facebooks. Squirrels are a big part of the USC community but not a lot of people think about them — though if they disappeared, I’m sure people would notice.
This idea came from talking to friends — I’m not going to lie, I had some wine — and then I said, it would be a great idea for people to post their squirrel pictures. After I made it, I complained that there were no likes and my friend liked it, and then more, and it just grew from there.
Now we have over 100 pictures in our inbox and 3,000 likes and it all happened very suddenly.
 
DT: Do some pictures just pop out at you?
Squirrels: When squirrels are doing more than just sitting or they have something in their hands, it stands out to me. There’s stuff we don’t include — if it’s too similar to one we’ve already written or it’s  inappropriate or blurry.
I want it to become a lot more USC community-oriented and be about things people can relate to, so I included a post about the Trojan Marching Band. I’m hoping that maybe we can do something about Troy Camp or Helenes or whoever to let people know about what’s going on.
 
DT: How long does it take to compose the biography of a squirrel?
Squirrels: Once I find a picture I like, it only takes about five or 10 minutes. Some of my friends have done a few, but I’ve done most of them myself. We ask people to submit stories, but we haven’t posted a [submitted] story yet. It’s all been us.
 
DT: What’s your creative process like?
Squirrels: I’ve named some of the squirrels after my good friends, to be honest. There’s one squirrel named after my best friend, and the squirrel has the same personality traits. One of my best friends is obsessed with Pizza Studio, one of my best friends is obsessed with Nutella and one of my friends is going to Coachella with me this weekend.
 
DT: The writing is pretty entertaining. Are any of you guys creative writing majors or something like that?
Squirrels: No, our majors are the opposite of writing.
 
DT: Are there any squirrels we’ll hear about soon?
Squirrels: I really need someone to send in a picture of three squirrels so we can have a parody of Mean Girls that is Mean Squirrels. We’ll try to keep it topical — like writing about Coachella.
 
DT: Why do you think this has spread so quickly? It seems to have grown faster than USC Compliments or USC Memes did.
Squirrels: It’s something that everyone can enjoy. If you’re reading USC Compliments and there are no compliments addressed to you or you don’t know any of the people, it’s a nice thing but it’s not very exciting. USC Squirrels just has something everyone can related to.
We’ve gotten almost as many messages of people saying how much they like us as we have [messages with] pictures of squirrels. There’s one girl who said, “I don’t go to your school, and I don’t even live in your country, but my friend goes to your school and this is the best page I’ve ever seen.”

It was another robust weekend at the box office as four films managed to earn more than $18 million each, with the Evil Dead remake hauling in $25.7 million —which is more than the rest of the franchise combined.
Though Evil Dead didn’t turn out to be the most terrifying film ever (as it declared on its poster), it’s certainly a home run for FilmDistrict; if this leads to the return of Ash, then all the better.
Universal Pictures should be happy with the $18.6 million that the 3D update of Jurassic Park brought in, as it shows the 20-year-old property still has staying power. This bodes well for Jurassic Park IV, which is scheduled to debut in June 2014. The film still only snagged the No. 4 spot for the weekend, as both G.I. Joe: Retaliation and The Croods had great post-Easter drop-offs.
This weekend we see two films that couldn’t be any more different: 42, the biopic of Jackie Robinson, and Scary Movie 5, the long-gestating sequel to the horror-spoof franchise.
42, directed by Brian Helgeland, stars Chadwick Boseman as Jackie Robinson, who was the first black player to break the baseball color line. The film itself focuses on the relationship between Robinson and Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), the team executive of the Brooklyn Dodgers who brought the second baseman over from the Montreal Royals in 1947.
There’s truly not enough that can be written about the enormous cultural impact that Robinson brought to the game of baseball and ultimately to American society. Robinson was able to win over the hecklers and overcome prominent racial tension when he proved himself to be not only a good player, but one of the most exceptional baseball players to play the game.
In fact, he left such an impact on the MLB that it adopted Jackie Robinson Day on April 15 on which all players wear the number 42. That number remains the only universally retired number in American professional sports.
The MLB and Warner Bros. have used this synergy to its fullest with the movie’s marketing playing prominently through the league, which opened its season just last week.
There are some factors going against the film, though that’s through no fault of the importance of Robinson. It’s just that baseball movies hardly ever have a huge opening. In fact, the highest opening for a baseball movie is 2011’s Moneyball. The simple fact that baseball isn’t as popular as it once was doesn’t help either.
This film does have more going for it than Moneyball, which had the benefit of several award nominations and a much bigger star in Brad Pitt at the forefront but didn’t have nearly as historically significant of a plot as 42 does. If there were any sports figure you could open big with, it’d be Jackie Robinson, with the release coming around the start of the MLB season, 42  should open at $20 million.
Also coming out this weekend is Scary Movie 5, which arrives seven years after the last one. This one uses the Paranormal Activity franchise as the basis of its “plot,” but it also lampoons films ranging from Black Swan to Inception — not to mention the real-life exploits of Charlie Sheen and Lindsay Lohan, who star as themselves in the film.
A lot has changed in the last seven years since Scary Movie 4 made more than $90 million in 2006. After a series of absolutely dismal films such as Epic Movie, Disaster Movie and Meet the Spartans, the spoof genre is as close to dead as it’s ever been. In fact, the highest grossing spoof since the fourth Scary Movie was A Haunted House, which came out just three months ago and parodied the same movies that this one is lampooning.
Because of its proximity to A Haunted House, Scary Movie 5 seems even worse for wear. The film also seems to be falling under the same trappings that those awful spoofs had. Rather than actually setting up a joke at the expense of a property, all they seem to be doing is just showing you a cultural reference and leaving that as the whole punchline (“Hey audience! Remember Black Swan? … That’s the joke”). It’s more groan-inducing than laugh-inspiring.
The spoof genre is on life support and this film might be the last straw.  An opening more than $10 million would only happen if people are truly that bored over the weekend, or if they think that Charlie Sheen or Lindsay Lohan don’t get enough attention from the public.

At the very top of the San Gabriel Mountains lives a couple named Ken and Shino Charlson. From the outside, their house is like any other. A dog, Morgan, generally lies out in the sun, lazing the day away.

But, inside the house, down in the garage, doodle-ridden greeting cards are strewn across worktables. In the corner, lie three antique letterpresses.
Shino Charlson and her husband Ken Charlson are one of the power couples of the greeting-card world. The couple, one part a creative thinker and one part business acumen, creates cards inspired by a fusion of midcentury modern, Scandinavian and Japanese art styles, combined with the distinctive style of the Heidelberg and Chandler & Price letterpresses.
The husband-and-wife duo said they always knew they wanted to start their own company, but the decision to enter the greeting-card business came about organically. When Shino Charlson helped a friend in the industry out for a period, she found that she not only enjoyed it, but also that she had a knack for it.
“There was nothing else like it,” Ken Charlson said. “[Shino and her friends] had the perfect combination of elements — they were hard workers, really creative people who came up with really cute designs, and they were doing it with the letterpress.”
The Charlsons attribute part of their success to the look of their cards, created by the unique imprint the letterpress’ leave behind when they print onto the paper.  The Mad Men-style art appeals to those who want their cards to have a more vintage look.
Ken Charlson described the mid-century modern look, as well as the Scandinavian “design ethos” that Ken and Shino Charlson are inspired by, as having “light airiness to it with a clear purpose.”
They try to loosely incorporate the idiosyncrasies of this type of art and transcribe it into their work.
“It’s helped shape what [we] think looks cool,” Ken Charlson said.
To create their signature cards, the Charlsons use two types of letterpresses — the Chandler & Price and the Heidelberg hand-driven machines, which reside in their garage studio.
Shino Charlson’s designs, which are the focal points of the cards, are what make them truly stand out.
Surprisingly, Shino Charlson said that her favorite designs aren’t Fugu Fugu’s bestsellers, such as “Birthday Tiger,” which shows a picture of a one-tiger marching band celebrating with a drum, or “Birthday Gift Boy,” which depicts a baby waiting to meet the world. Her favorite designs are displayed on “Birthday Candle,” which shows a candle eager to make someone’s birthday wish come true, and “V-day Undie,” which is a more realistic cartoon of a girl on Valentine’s Day.
Over the years, not only has the couple’s business grown, but so has their relationship as well.
“[Fugu Fugu Press] has definitely made it stronger,” said Shino Charlson. “With this, I have to tell him everything on my mind or stuff doesn’t get done. So communication is a requirement.”
For the husband and wife duo, work isn’t work at all. Being creative-minded individuals, they both thrive off of the artistic freedom they get through their business.
In college, Ken Charlson was a music major. He still plays piano four nights a week at the Hotel Bel Air and gives piano lessons when he can. Ken However, it is the combination of his creative and business-minded brain, as well as a passion for old-style letterpresses that make him a perfect foil to Shino’s artistic ideas.
Shino Charlson said art has always been intertwined in her life.  Before the card-making business, she was doing illustrations for children’s books and editorial illustrations for publications such as LA Weekly and The Wall Street Journal. Now, she’s completely involved in Fugu Fugu Press, constantly thinking up designs for their biannual card releases.
“You get inspired by little things, and you don’t really know until you’re sitting at the desk on the computer and you start designing,” Shino Charlson said.
Though free time is scarce for the Charlson’s, they love to go to their friends’ art galleries when they can, especially since it’s one way Shino  Charlson gains inspiration.
“Most of our friends are in creative industries, so talking to them about it, not even looking at their stuff, inspires us, and then looking at their stuff inspires us more,” said Shino Charlson.
On the printing side, Ken Charlson loves when they can see other shops and compare ideas.
“It will just open a new door on how to solve a problem that we’ve seen,” said Ken Charlson. “It’s always fun to see other [print] shops, and see how they do things.”
So far, the duo must be doing something right. Their signature cards have drawn a loyal following. Shino Charlson said that she is excited to continue drawing inspiration from the world around her for future Fugu Fugu designs.
“You don’t know what sticks in your brain and comes out days, months later,” she said.

Music lovers rejoice: The Coachella music festival begins today. Looking at this year’s lineup, it is clear that Coachella is continuing its pattern of featuring more and more well-known names to play along with its more traditional indie fare.
This year, well-established bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Franz Ferdinand and Passion Pit will be headlining, attracting even larger audiences to the popular music fest.
Music mania · Coachella is a popular music and arts festival among college students. This year, a number of names ­— big and small — will perform, including the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and the legendary Red Hot Chili Peppers. — Courtesy of Coachella
Though the Chili Peppers are tried-and-true rock loyalty, many of the other better-known names have only just become mainstream and Coachella might be their proving ground for their newfound prominence. Here is a quick look at some of the big names, and some of the up-and-coming artists that are must-sees at Coachella 2013.
Rising stars and lesser-known indie artists worth seeing include Tegan and Sara and Beach House. Both are electro-pop artists but each definitely has a distinct sound. Tegan and Sara, a band formed by twin sisters, is like Passion Pit in that they have been on the indie music scene for quite some time.
The duo finally broke out with its hit “Closer,” proving that its upbeat, dance-y songs can translate to a mainstream audience. The Canadian sisters’ hit has an infectious beat and a message that promotes a fun, carefree lifestyle — which pretty much sums up Coachella.
Those who are interested in more alternative rap music need look no further than Earl Sweatshirt, who is part of infamous Los Angeles rap collective Odd Future. Earl Sweatshirt’s raps dig deeper than the typical rhymes  heard in popular rap music. He has a biting, sarcastic style and a tone that can range anywhere from angry to completely lighthearted.
In the title track from his self-titled album EARL, he raps about drinking a concoction of multiple drugs and the adverse effects this had on his body. Though this might sound typical of rap music, he delivers the lyrics in a different way than his peers. He is not rapping from a pedestal like big-name rappers do, thus he sounds much more accessible.
Alyssa Kennedy, a freshman majoring in psychology, said any attendees looking to discover a young, alternative sound should be sure to watch Earl Sweatshirt’s performance.
“Earl Sweatshirt is awesome. He’s not one of the bigger names in the lineup but he’s really talented — and he’s only 19. It’s cool to see younger people up on such an important stage like Coachella.”
Coachella 2013 will also feature Passion Pit, a band that has become increasingly popular recently. One of their songs, “Take a Walk,” has gotten lots of airplay on local radio stations and has catapulted Passion Pit even more into the mainstream.
The alternative-electric band has been around for a while, performing at festivals and gathering a substantial following in the indie music world. Appearing at Coachella this year will give the band an opportunity to solidify their presence in the main music scene.
Additionally, 2 Chainz, a rap artist on the rise, will be continuing his festival circuit with a Coachella performance. The rapper has been featured on tracks with many other well-known rap artists, from Kanye West to Drake, and is quickly gaining mainstream name recognition in the rap music world.
For fans of rap, 2 Chainz is definitely not one to miss, especially because he is often joined onstage by other local rap artists wherever he performs. Fingers crossed that Kanye will leave Kim Kardashian’s side and pass through Indio.
As Liam Jennis, a freshman majoring in business administration who will be attending the festival, said the rapper knows how to put on a show.
“2 Chainz is really fun to watch. He has so much energy on stage,” Jennis said. “Plus the fact that he has worked with artists like Kanye West and Big Sean is awesome. He is definitely going places.”
Of course, the aforementioned Red Hot Chili Peppers still remains one of the most highly anticipated acts to perform at Coachella. It’s hard not to know the legendary rock band. Native to California, this band still tours consistently, but fans will be sure to enjoy seeing them perform in the much more relaxed environment of Coachella.
Katie Durocher, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism who will be attending Coachella, summed it up when she spoke about the band and Coachella in general.
“I’m really excited to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I love them and I am really pleased that they will be there,” Durocher said. “The lineup is really good for rock and indie music fans and it should be a great time overall.”
For fans of rising indie artists, as well as those who want to celebrate some of the most well-known and prolific bands of our time in a singular location, one thing is certain: Coachella is the place to be to hear your favorite music and discover some new talent while you dance the days and nights away.
 
Coachella runs April 12-14 and April 19-21.

Rallying against fossil-fuel investments 
USC students take pride in the large sums of money the school receives to enhance our educational experience. It’s with a cumulative endowment of $3.5 billion that ’SC is able to maintain its standing as one of the top research institutions in the world.
But while our university is grateful for corporate generosity to our educational community, many of these gifts come with negative implications. Gifts, such as the $1 million donated to USC at the USC-Cal football game on Oct. 12, 2012, are tied to the major fossil fuel companies causing destruction to our planet; receiving their dirty money is no laudable feat.
USC’s endowment of $3.5 billion is the 21st largest in the nation. In order to keep that endowment fund growing, our university also invests that money in the stock market. At the moment, a significant portion of our endowment money is invested in fossil fuel companies. We believe that this is unacceptable. After all, it’s our generation of students and future leaders that will be forced to deal with an incoming slew of environmental disasters of greater magnitude. How can our university invest money in corporations whose business models destroy our future?
It’s contradictory for an educational institution to be preparing its students for the future, while simultaneously contributing to its destruction.  Participating in a divestment campaign is one way we can get our institution to play a significant role in supporting that future. We demand that USC freeze any new fossil-fuel investments starting now and pull out from all dirty energy ties in the near future.
USC is not the only institution involved in a fossil-fuel divestment campaign. More than 250 universities across the nation have started campaigns, some of which are significantly ahead of that at USC. Harvard’s board of trustees has already met with students to discuss divestment, and UC Berkeley students finished voting yesterday on a referendum for fossil-fuel divestment at Cal and across the UC system.
This campaign, as expected, will be an uphill battle. Some members on USC’s board of trustees are the biggest players in the fossil fuels industry. Just to name a couple: Ray R. Irani Ph.D. ’57 was the chairman and CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corporation from 1990 to 2011. Chengyu Fu M.S. ’86 is the chairman of China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec Group), which ranks among the top 10 largest companies in the world by revenue.
This is not to say that they are bad people or that they don’t care about the well-being of future generations. After all, they are part of our Trojan Family, too. It’s just that times have changed, and our generation has a new issue to deal with: climate change. Given the information we now have at our disposal, we must collaborate with our university’s board of trustees to “clean up” our portfolio.
If you’re concerned that a clean portfolio will harm the profits of the university, consider this: a study by the Aperio Group proves that by excluding investments in the “Filthy Fifteen” corporations, the resulting effect to portfolio risk is negligible. In fact, fossil-fuel companies can be considered overvalued: their worth does not include the costs of the destruction they cause to our planet.
Our university is one of the finest in the nation, and its role in the world is an increasingly important one. But unless it is willing to free itself of dirty investments, the progress it makes in other areas is only parochial.
There may be genuine attempts toward on-campus sustainability, but unless the university is also willing to clean up its portfolio, these attempts are of little significance. This is why we are calling on our university to divest from fossil fuels.

On Monday, Praveen Halappanavar was questioned in an Irish court about the events surrounding the death of his wife, Savita Halappanavar.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
Savita Halappanavar, an Indian dentist who moved from southwest India to Dublin with her husband in 2008, was 17 weeks pregnant when she was sent to University Hospital Galway on Oct. 21, 2012 after complaints of back pain, according to CNN. Praveen Halappanavar, in response to the recent inquest, testified that “his wife was advised her unborn baby would likely die, and that she was in extreme pain.”
The couple asked for an abortion, under Irish law, however, abortion is currently illegal unless it occurs as a result of a medical intervention performed when the mother’s life is at risk. Praveen Halappanavar told the hearing in Galway that health officials informed him that in Catholic Ireland, an abortion could not be performed while the fetus was still alive. Doctors had still detected the heartbeat of the fetus and denied the request for termination. Three days after being admitted into the hospital, the fetus died and was removed. And on Oct. 28, Savita Halappanavar died of septicemia, or blood poisoning.
Her death sparked waves of outrage globally. The Times of India led its online coverage with the headline, “Ireland murders pregnant Indian dentist.”
Demands for new abortion laws have deluged the nation since — and rightly so.
According to the World Health Organization, “nearly half of all abortions worldwide are unsafe, and nearly all unsafe abortions (98 percent) occur in developing countries.”
Complications from unsafe abortion accounted for an estimated 13 percent of all maternal deaths worldwide in 2003 and 2008.  And yet, Savita Halappanavar passed away because of a preventable cause in the highly developed country of Ireland in the 21st century. Her story is a tragedy that should never have to happen to anyone, especially because it could have been avoided. The high-tech hospital was there, her family was there to be consulted and health officials were there to make a decision that would be best for not just the fetus, but Savita Halappanavar herself.
This tragedy was the working of stringent, stubborn abortion laws and medical negligence. Even though abortion does go against Catholic beliefs, greater exceptions should be made when taking into consideration the special circumstances that surround pregnancies.
According to CNN, Ireland’s Minister of Health James Reilly had indeed announced last year that abortions are permissible when the life of the mother is at risk. Though that might seem like progress in a country that has been struggling with abortion reform for the past 25 years, this proclamation begs the question, why can’t the overall the health of the mother also be considered? Why wait until a possibly fatal emergency is at hand? Why wait until it would most likely be too late to save not only the fetus, but the mother as well?
As a legal expert in Ireland told the Guardian, “it would have been lawful to offer Savita Halappanavar a termination that she and her husband believed would have saved her life.”
Yet the hospital refused to comply with a 1992 Irish Supreme Court ruling establishing a woman’s right to abortion when her life is at risk.
Concerns over the life of the baby should not override concerns for the mother’s life. By doing this, the reasons for which pro-life advocates oppose abortions are completely invalidated because the mother’s life is thus regarded as less significant than that of the fetus. Ironically, by attempting to prevent the murder of a fetus, the case turns into the murder of the mother.
That’s not to say that we should abandon the tradition and practices of a religion so prevalent in a country such as Ireland, however. It is entirely possible to uphold those tenets that are for the life of the fetus as long as it does not overstep into endangering the life of the mother.
The issue of the law lies in the fact that though it does provide provisions for abortion, it only does in cases “where it is deemed necessary to save the life of a mother,” said Dr. Gerry Whyte, an associate professor at Trinity College Dublin. The “deeming” of whether or not the case calls for immediate abortion is subjective, varying with medical judgment. The question is: Would the termination of the pregnancy have saved her life or not?
We must stand up for personal decision-making when it comes to lives in jeopardy — when it becomes not only about saving a life of an unborn fetus, but of a living woman who is a wife, sister and daughter to others. In this fight over abortion, we often get blindsided and forget that the purpose of pro-life policies should be one and the same — simply preserving and saving lives when possible.
As the Irish government deliberates on the introduction of new abortion legislation in the coming months, it’s time for change so that cases like this will never happen again — not just in Ireland, but in all countries for all women.
 
Valerie Yu is a freshman majoring in biological sciences and English. Her column “Heart of the Matter” runs Fridays.
My questions have to do with ONLY those cases in which the mother’s life is at risk.  Do all pro-life people believe that abortion is wrong even up to the point of the mother’s life being at risk?  I do understand that there are people who believe in earlier abortions even when there is no risk to the mother’s health, but I am not talking about them.  Again, do all pro-life people believe that abortion is wrong even up to the point of the mother’s life being at risk?  Essentially, I believe that many people are saying that they don’t believe in abortion under ANY circumstance.  That essentially says to me that if they were pregnant, they would choose their death over the death of their unborn child.  My opinion is not in this.  It ‘s only something that I have come up with when I hear people talk about abortion.  Is that what people are saying?  “I will die rather than have my unborn child terminated.”
In articulating her argument in favour of abortion rights, Ms. Yu is guilty of the same thing that most abortion-rights supporters are guilty of:  She fails to point out that most abortions have nothing to do with any medical risk or saving lives whatsoever, but are instead a very drastic but legal means of birth control.  Yes, many abortions are medically warranted, but sadly, most simply are not.  Ms. Yu avoids any focus on this reality by instead pointing to incomplete statistics.  She claims that nearly half of abortions performed are unsafe, and that nearly all of the unsafe abortions are performed in developing countries, but she fails to point out other equally compelling realities that should be part of any discussion on abortion.
For example… To being with, most abortions are performed in developing countries in the first place because even the idea of abortion is a sort of bourgeous conceit that is derived from privileged and selfish societies where changing one’s mind on “being pregnant” is about as acceptable as changing careers.  Industrialized nations have not only brought us great advances in science and medicine, but apparently are also the epicenter for enlightened wisdom on social issues.  Just look at the current debate on the definition of “marriage” where modern-society wants to change the definition of a gender-specific term so that a statistically small group of people feel “included”.  Modern society has even made accepting one’s gender no longer necessary because that too can be changed on the operating table.  Likewise, an undesirable pregnancy can be “fixed” in America about as easily as removing a mole.  
By contrast, people in undeveloped nations generally assume that the gender you’re born as is the gender you die as… and yes, that pregancy is a likely result of sexual intercourse, and thus a self-inflicted responsibility… perhaps even a blessing.  (How archaic!)  It would be easy for America’s elite society to dismiss these people as “simple” and “old-fashioned, but that of course would be a disservice to religious societies around the world that generally mirror these values, including heavily-Catholic Ireland where the tragic account of Savita Halappanavar took place.  And yes, some old-fashioned… dare I say “traditional”… Americans still hold these values as well, perhaps an homage to our nation’s all-but-forgotten Christian past.
I’m also alarmed at Ms. Yu’s suggestion that the decision not to abort Savita’s baby amounted to “murdering the mother”.  Suggesting this sort of moral equivilence is frankly reckless, and this rhetoric does nothing to advance the debate.  There are definitely times when an abortion is medically warranted, and decisions in such cases should be discussed openly and accurately between the physician and patient, but a reasoned and thoughtful decision against abortion… particularly if rooted in conviction… does not amount to murder.  
The debate over abortion will surely continue… as it should because there are valid arguments on both sides.  What troubles me is simply the fact that most abortions are not necessary, yet the debate too often focusses on the minority of cases involving rape or lives in jeopardy.  In the process, people of faith or conviction are marginalized as simple or archaic, or apparently even worse – as murderers.  This is simply unacceptable.  Unfortunately, Ms. Yu’s discussion of the tragedy involving Savit Halappanavar’s does not provide a complete and accurate understanding of abortion in our society, and thus adds little to the debate.

Take me out to the ballgame.
It’s a phrase customarily sung, but not as often spoken in earnest.
The experience of witnessing a baseball game in person is completely unparalleled. The yard evokes eternal summer by day, and at night the stadium lights glow like a Christmas tree.
Baseball games aren’t deafeningly raucous the way football and basketball games are, and their high-energy moments come in smaller and more infrequent bursts. Still, they are usually family affairs where kids can bring their gloves, while the more sophisticated crowd can still maintain conversation at a near-normal decibel level.
So, it is with heavy hearts that sports fans acknowledge the end of an era.
The Boston Red Sox announces yesterday that after ten years, their sellout streak (the longest in professional sports) finally came to a close at 820 games—794 regular-season and 26 postseason games. It shouldn’t matter if you’re a Yankees fan; that’s a tremendous and unrivaled feat.
Loving sports comes at a price. Aside from the fact that it takes its toll on us emotionally, being a fan can put a major dent in our budget. This year, that statement rings especially true. According to the AP, the average ticket price for a Major League Baseball game rose 2.7 percent from 2012.
Understandably, that makes the Sox’s streak so impressive; fans were willing to fork out the year in and year out. But what changed? Here’s a hint: it’s not the price bump (even though Boston has the highest average ticket price).
To put it bluntly, it’s because the Sox started to suck—by their recent standards. Boston ended 2012 on an eight game losing streak, one that sunk them 26 games behind the division-leading Yankees. Since the streak started in 2003, the Sox hadn’t plummeted past third place in the American League East or dropped below a .500 winning percentage. They did both last year.
Is it a coincidence that the streak ends following their worst performance in a decade? My guess is no. What’s even sadder than snapping ten years of the best streak in professional sports is the lack of so-called team loyalty. That’s not to slam Red Sox fans for being discouraged by a losing record, as it’s a universal problem that transcends all sports. But for the sake of argument, I’ll direct the following diatribe at Boston.
When the going gets tough, the fans get going. Going away. Let’s be clear here, it’s not unreasonable to dislike when your team loses. But here’s a thought: those fans that stick around even when their team is slumping truly should be proud of themselves (here’s looking at you, Cubs fans).
For fans that stuck with a cursed Red Sox team for all those years of the unlikely, the improbable, and the seemingly downright impossible: what gives? Don’t change your stripes now. Seasons are long, and there’s a lifetime of baseball ahead. After all, it took you 86 years to bring home a championship. Patience is a virtue, and I think you guys know it.
So here’s to the diehards: die hard no matter how many you’ve got in the loss column. It always counts.
Another important issue is that if you are a senior citizen, travel insurance regarding pensioners is something you should make sure you really look at. The older you are, the greater at risk you are for having something undesirable happen to you while overseas. If you are not covered by a number of comprehensive insurance cover, you could have some serious difficulties. Thanks for expressing your good tips on this blog site.

USC has hired hall of famer and former Woman of Troy great Cynthia Cooper-Dyke as it new women’s basketball head coach, USC Athletic Director Pat Haden announced Thursday.
Cooper-Dyke, who as a player helped lead USC to a pair of NCAA championships before winning an Olympic gold medal and four WNBA titles, looks to restore the winning tradition of the USC women’s basketball program.
“In Cynthia Cooper-Dyke, we have a proven winning coach who happens to be a USC basketball icon,” Haden said in a statement. “She was a part of the best basketball ever played here at USC, and she seen success at so many levels of the game. As a coach she has turned around several programs. We believe she can lead USC back to successful women’s basketball, and we welcome her back to the USC campus.”
Cooper-Dyke, 49, has an eight-year collegiate head coaching record of 150-106 (.586), with seven postseason appearances and three league coach-of-the-year awards.
“If you were to ask me what my dream job was at any point in my coaching career, I would always have said my dream is to come back and lead the USC women’s basketball team,” Cooper-Dyke said in a statement. “I’m literally living the dream coming back to California and being named the new women’s basketball coach at USC.”
She takes over a squad that went 11-20 overall and finished seventh in the Pac-12 under fourth-year head coach Michael Cooper, who resigned last month (the two coaches are not related).
“I’m very excited to coach every one of these USC players,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I’m excited about the talent we have. I’m excited to teach and learn and motivate and really see them blossom into the players they can truly become.”
Prior to coming to USC, Cooper-Dyke was head coach at Texas Southern University and resurrected the Lady Tigers’ program, taking a 5-26 team and leading them in her first year to a 16-2 league mark and their first-ever Southwestern Athletic Conference regular season title.
Before the stint at Texas Southern, she spent two seasons as the head coach at UNC Wilmington, where her team not only set a school record for victories with a 24-9 mark, but made its first ever post-season appearance.
Cooper-Dyke began her college coaching career at Prairie View A&M, where she posted an 86-72 record with four postseason appearances during her five-year (2006-10) tenure there.
“I want to thank my coaching staffs and all the players I’ve coached,” Cooper-Dyke said. “The players are always in the forefront of everything we do. It’s about helping these women grow and succeed in this world. As a coach, you can’t be successful without your players believing in you and performing to the best of their abilities. I wouldn’t be here without them.”
Cooper-Dyke is one of the most decorated players to ever play women’s basketball. She won the 1981 L.A. city player of the year award at Locke High in Los Angeles, was named an All-Conference first teamer and made the NCAA All-tournament team as the Women of Troy advanced to the NCAA Final. At the professional level, she led the WNBA’s Houston Comets to a record four consecutive WNBA championships (1997-2000), being named WNBA Finals MVP each time.
She was inducted into the USC Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999, the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame in 2009 and the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010, in the latter becoming the first WNBA player to do so. At USC, she currently ranks ninth on the school’s all-time scoring list (1,559 points), eighth in assists (381) and third in steals (256).
“I want to thank Pat Haden and Donna Heinel and the entire Trojan Family for giving me this awesome opportunity,” Cooper-Dyke said. “I don’t take it lightly. I feel like the different programs I’ve been a part of…have prepared me in many ways for the Pac-12 and USC…I can’t promise it will happen in a year like it did at these other programs, but I promise we will put forth our best effort as a staff to create a program that embraces the work ethic and mentality that will help us be successful.”

It is the winter of 1967, just months before the My Lai massacre and the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and the characters of AMC’s Mad Men are haunted by death.
Sunday’s two hour season six premiere sent audiences right back into the height of the Vietnam War. Don Draper, who during Korea assumed the name and identity of a well-off soldier, meets a young soldier on vacation in Hawaii and winds up participating in his wedding. The kid gives him a Zippo lighter inscribed with the words: “OFTEN WE HAVE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE JUST NOT OUR BAG.” By the end of the episode it seems that, apart from giving away a strange bride, death is that inevitable thing that is just not Don Draper’s bag.
Through heavy-handed metaphor, Mad Men’s writers imply that their characters are descending into a kind of hell on earth. The episode opens with a first person shot of a man performing CPR on an unknown victim. It cuts to Don reading Dante’s Inferno on a Hawaiian beach.
But heaven and hell are permanent; the message of the episode is more about the transitory nature of life than the permanence of death. Don’s clients—Hawaiian hotel owners who sponsored his trip—would rather he sell Hawaii as a temporary oasis, rather than as Heaven. They don’t like the fatal connotations of the latter.
Don is, of course, entirely wrapped up in the connotations of image. He is his own walking ad campaign, a construction of signifiers from his phony name to his cigarettes. Told to “be himself” in an office photo shoot, he lights one up behind his desk and uses it to hide his face—brooding.
Photography has unsurprisingly been a motif throughout the series, starting with a campaign to sell the slideshow aid called the Carousel. In this week’s episode, images are put forth as in vain attempts to preserve life indefinitely. Don and Megan present a slideshow for their friends of their happy vacation to Hawaii, but Don looks bored, and several minutes later it is revealed that he has been unfaithful to Megan since their return.
Don seems to revile the permanent, mocking holy matrimony by telling an employee that the word “love” has been devalued in part by domestic life. Don also throws up at the funeral of Roger’s mother. Later, when it is revealed that Don’s doorman was the dying man at the start of the episode, Don begs him to describe what he saw during his heart attack (did you see a sunset?). Does Don dread the permanent because he’s a restless bachelor at heart, or because he is profoundly death-obsessed?
If it’s the latter he’s not the only one. Roger is unfazed by the death of his 90-something mother, and even announces to his analyst that he doesn’t care about anything. Yet he breaks down into tears upon hearing of the death of his shoe-shiner.
Don is also not the only runaway. His story is juxtaposed with that of Betty’s stepdaughter, who apparently has plans to move to California on her own. The mad men have been jolted out of ‘50s complacency, and the squares are seen directly interacting with youths who seek liberation. Perhaps, like Don, they will have to go through a certain kind of violent unrest in order to find a new path. As Don explains to the Hawaiian hotel moguls: “How do you get to heaven? Something terrible has to happen.”
I haven’t devoutly watched the series since season one, but I knew that the biggest cliffhanger was whether Don would cheat on Megan. Spoiler alert: he does! And with Linda Cardillini, no less. Not only that, this new lover was the one that lent him The Inferno. Don has descended back into the hell of infidelity.
War gave Don a new identity and consequently a shot at success, but it also condemned him to a life without truth or loyalty to the “real.” Instead of looking to personal relationships for eternal glory, he looks to the false paradise of a Hawaiian vacation: this is Don’s downfall. Recall that the innermost circle of Dante’s hell is not fire and brimstone, but ice.
Why analyze an hour and a half of television drama? Because there’s not too much else to talk about. Now that we’ve reached the late sixties, fashion among the over-thirties is a hot mess, and this show has always been more of a slow-walking art piece than entertainment.
During Don’s failed pitch meeting with the moguls, one humorously explains to him, “I’m sorry but this is very poetic.” Each episode of Mad Men that I have seen (just the first season and this past episode) contains thematically interweaving storylines that reveal a repressed anxiety. It is not ever difficult to connect those dots, but I hail the show’s creative team for giving audiences some dots to connect. It seems heavy-handed metaphor is still Mad Men’s bag, and to me it ain’t no drag.

May 1st is approaching quickly. For most of us, that’s probably an irrelevant date. But let’s take a moment and revisit our senior year of high school, when May 1st was more than just another day.
In fact, it was the BIG day: The deadline to decide which big letters would adorn our crewneck sweaters until the end of time.
But for some seniors, it’s not as clear cut as it is for all and decision might be tough. For some, their dream school may have thrown them a little curveball.
“At first I was confused,” said freshman Rachel Kohn, a broadcast journalism major. “I had an acceptance letter sitting in front of me to the school I dreamed of going to, but it wasn’t that simple because I had to wait a whole semester.”
For Rachel Kohn and several other spring admits, it was time to figure out what to do with the five months they now had off. But that wasn’t going to be easy for everyone.
Initially, freshman Mckenna Aiello, a print and digital journalism major, felt disappointed grappling with the road ahead of her.
“It took some time for it to sink in that I would be missing out on the best semester of the school year with football games and everything,” said Aiello.
Although the university hosts some information sessions for this unique class of students, many criticize the lack of communication between the administration and spring admits during the fall semester.
“We had a Facebook group of confused young adults,” admits freshman Jessica Cohen, an active member of the online USC Spring Admit page. “So we suggested having the administration send a monthly newsletter to all spring admits reminding them of important dates and informing them of the documents or deadlines to meet.”
Indeed, the options were endless for spring admits, even if the administration did not make them explicit.
There was the opportunity to take the entire fall semester off to travel, as some did. You could study abroad, roam the Swiss Alps or row through the Amazon if daddy’s checkbook permitted. Or if you’re craving a taste of adult-life, you could work 40 hour weeks at retail stores or take on a paid internship.
Alternatively, you could study at another four year university: ra-ra’ing in the colors of a different college for a few months in order to receive a complete fall college experience — dorm life, sporting events, parties, and all.
The most commonly taken path (also the most encouraged one) is to attend a local community college in order to accrue general education credits. But frankly, it’s difficult to ask high-achieving students with stellar grades and extracurricular activities to go to a junior college while everyone else revels in the greatness of a four-year university.
But whatever route you take, be sure to keep in touch with your USC counselor, who will be at your service during times of confusion. Furthermore, keep Ma and Pa happy by finishing all paperwork on time (e.g. housing deposit and your acceptance of spring admission). For those taking classes, fill out your articulation agreements in order for your courses to carry over from your other school during the fall. And if you have any other worries, ask another Trojan! There are plenty of other spring admits eager to share their experiences.
So, my dear seniors, May 1st is not the end of the world. As you consider the large crimson and gold packet sitting on your desk, don’t make any hasty decisions, weigh your options, and like that poster in your kindergarten classroom told you: Follow your heart.
And if you do see yourself walking through the dreamy McCarthy Quad or cruising Trousdale on your bike, take it from Aiello: “It will be worth the wait.”
