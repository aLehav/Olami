Medical examiners confirmed that the human remains found by authorities on Tuesday were that of former Los Angeles Police Department officer Christopher Dorner, according to CNN.
The positive identification of Dorner’s body came two days after a deadly shootout between Dorner and authorities, followed by a fire in the Big Bear cabin where Dorner’s remains were found. Dorner’s dental records were used to confirm his identity.
The 11-day manhunt for Dorner concluded with a total of four deaths, beginning with the double homicide of former Dept. of Public Safety officer Keith Lawrence and his fiancee, Monica Quan. The couple’s bodies were discovered in a parked car near their Irvine home. Quan was the daughter of LAPD Capt. Randal Quan, Dorner’s police union representative who represented him prior to his dismissal from the LAPD.
Dorner was also the primary suspect in the murder of Riverside police officer Michael Crain, who was killed on Feb. 7 in an ambush allegedly by Dorner. Crain’s partner was injured in the ambush.
Dorner’s final victim was San Bernardino Sheriff’s Deputy Jeremiah MacKay, who was killed in the final shootout between Dorner and police on Feb. 12. A second deputy was injured in the shootout, but is expected to survive his injuries. In total, three people were wounded.
The cause for Dorner’s rage appears to be explained in his 14-page online manifesto, in which he cited his dismissal from the LAPD and the lack of improvement within the department toward since the 1992 Los Angeles riots as reasons for his attacks. In 2009, Dorner was fired for falsely accusing his training officer of kicking a subdued suspect. Though Dorner challenged the dismissal, he was ultimately unsuccessful.
Dorner dedicated most of his manifesto to the issue of race, noting various instances throughout his upbringing and his time in the LAPD that contributed to his 40-person hit list. Quan’s father was named in the manifesto, as well as numerous other members of the LAPD.
In response to the manifesto, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck announced on Feb. 9 that the LAPD would re-examine the details leading to Dorner’s termination from the department.
During the LAPD’s pursuit of Dorner, the city of Los Angeles issued a $1 million reward for information leading to his capture. Twenty-nine donors contributed to the reward, including USC President C. L. Max Nikias. What is going to be done with the reward is still under debate.
“More than 20 jurisdictions and entities are involved in this reward, so all of them will be coming together to collectively determine whether any individual or individuals qualify for it,” Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Beck said in a joint statement. “Our personal hope is that the reward will be distributed, but we must follow the rules and respect the procedures of each entity.”
If he’d wanted a fair trial, he wouldn’t have shot himself in the head.
I doubt they’ll be throwing around metals.  That sounds dangerous.  Medals, maybe.
That’s only a story.  No proof that happened just yet.   Real easy to bust a slug in a dead man’s head who has been broiled on high for 12 hours before anybody bothered to look.
Yeah man, Medals would be better but you never know with LAPD…
Peace!
Are you really that naive to think that the cops would’ve not fired if he voluntarily surrendered during that standoff? They would’ve blasted him even if he walked out that cabin with his hands raised in the air…I don’t condone what Dorner allegedly did to the Irvine couple or the two cops, but he’s not as evil as the media or LAPD make him out to be.
You have excellent points!  People have already forgot LAPD shot 3 people who they thought might be Dorner who were neither armed or looked anything like a 270 pound African American.     They shot two old Asian ladies delivering newspapers papers.   Their pick-up has over a 100 bullet holes.    Dorner was a dead-man walking as soon as they found his manifesto.
Pity the man couldn’t get a fair trial before he was burned at the stake.  Don’t get me wrong, he murdered people that didn’t have it coming and he needed to pay for that behind bars.   That’s what judges and juries are supposed to do and not a crazed mob of angry cops bent on vengeance trying to close the book before Obama went on national stage that night.   I heard the police scanner traffic playback on MSNBC and there is no mistaking what those cops had in mind.  I’m sure after a “thorough investigation” they’ll be throwing out metals like candy from a pinata…

The Leventhal School of Accounting announced this week that it would be introducing a new online Master of Business Taxation for Working Professionals program.
Shirley Maxey, the associate dean and director of the Leventhal master’s programs, said the program will aim to increase flexibility for students without compromising quality.

“We feel very strongly that this program has to be great,” Maxey said. “It can’t be just canned lectures. It has to be as great as our current reputation. We were very careful in going forward with not just putting the professor in front of the camera and having students watch [the video].”
Leventhal’s program shows a growing focus at USC for online education. In 2011, USC introduced nearly 50 online graduate degree programs that span nine schools. In August 2012, President C. L. Max Nikias announced that he expected to expand online programs to all 18 schools and double online enrollment within five years.
The program is slated to debut in fall 2013, pending approval by the Western Association of Schools and College, which accredits all educational programs in California and Hawaii. It will seek to ensure a high level of interaction by capping its first class at 24 students.
The leaders will use live video discussion forums in place of a physical classroom and online video chats with professors as a substitute for in-person office hours. In this virtual classroom, the program will present many of the features of traditional courses, including lectures and guest speakers, while expanding the experience by including interactive activities and allowing students to proceed through the material each week at their own pace.
Maxey noted that professors could select not to participate in the online program, while participating professors would be assisted in the transition to an online class.
“We are offering to have an instructional design specialist work with [the professors] to help them convert existing classes to this format and incorporate all kinds of new techniques and technologies,” Maxey said.
The online MBT-Working Professional program will have the same degree requirements and faculty as its on-campus counterpart, which offers 30 units of coursework on taxation. Maxey said she was confident there is a strong market for the program.
“Before it was even on the website, we started to get some calls,” Maxey said. “We do think there’s a pretty good-sized market. Most firms ask [employees] to go back and get some graduate education because the field of taxation is so complex.”
The existing MBT-Working Professionals program is not intended to be exclusively online. For example there is a video conferencing arrangement with a school in Orange County.
For some students, a traditional class could be inconvenient or difficult to attend.
“There’s just a tremendous workload for [accountants], particularly for tax people during tax season,” Maxey said. “These folks are working full-time and jumping in their cars and driving to campus for a three-hour class.”
Marshall and Leventhal undergraduates said an online class in accounting would accomodate their schedules.
David Choi, a junior double majoring in accounting and business administration, agreed with the convenience of the online program.
“As working can be very time consuming, an online class would be beneficial to working professionals,” Choi said.
Still, some students have concerns over the ability of Internet education to replace a traditional in-class experience.
Bryan Kim, another junior double majoring in accounting and business administration, said the classroom environment is vital to understanding.
“It’s always better to have someone next to you who can physically show you and teach you,” Kim said.
However, Troy Patipanavat, a junior majoring in accounting, offered an optimistic perspective.
“With a great and charismatic instructor who is willing to be responsive, this online class could definitely replicate an in-class experience,” Patipanavat said. “I think this online program is a fantastic idea.”

Researchers from the Keck School of Medicine have found a way to genetically modify mice so the rodents’ immune systems act like human immune systems, a discovery that will impact medical testing.
Doctors Weiming Yuan, Xiangshu Wen, Seil Kim and Agnieszka Lawrenczyk published the study this month in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The research took about two years and the project will be completed within four years.
Yuan, the project’s chief investigator, began work on the mice a few years ago, after he recognized that current clinical trials were not successful. Yuan attributed this to minor differences between human and rodent immune systems. This difference led him to attempt to humanize the mouse model.
“Making a mouse is a challenging project,” Yuan said. “This will be helping a lot of scientists to further clinical trials.”
The mice contribute to research toward finding better treatments for cancer. When tested on mice, the drug α-GalCer successfully rid the animal of cancerous cells. The same results, however, were not obtained when the medication was used on human subjects, showing differences between the two species’ immune systems.
The mice modification project required the successful insertion of a new functioning gene. This type of modification is far more challenging than so-called “knock-out” genetic modification, which is modification that works by eliminating a gene’s function. Yuan said the next step will be to further humanize the T-cell receptor, which activates lymphocytes that initiate immune system responses.
The team used the difficulty of the project as motivation to succeed. Yuan said they were all very enthusiastic about their research despite difficulty working with the small size of their grant.
“[We] definitely needed more funding — it’s the practical challenges,” Yuan said. “Lots of scientists are concerned about the funding situation.”
The team hopes to further their work in the humanization of the rodents’ immune system.
“We will branch out, but right now we have more work to further humanize the mice,” Yuan said. “We still have quite a lot of work to do before we branch out.”
The dedication and enthusiasm of the team is only gaining momentum. “The future model will be even more reliable,” Yuan said.

Though the USC Transportation project to construct tram shelters was set for completion by October 2013, the construction has yet to commence.
Gimme shelter · New tram shelters are planned to be completed on the University Park Campus by October 2013. No shelters have been built yet. – Lauren Wong | Daily Trojan
The project, which was announced in April 2012, secured funding to construct shelters along six tram stops to ensure a more comfortable waiting area for passengers, replacing the benches at tram stops in place currently.
Undergraduate Student Government endorsed the project of building tram shelters because it will improve student safety and their transportation options on and around campus.
Nikki Windisch, a freshman majoring in human development and aging, looks forward to the construction of tram stops.
“I thought it was a great idea for USC to build tram shelters because sometimes there are a lot of students standing [on] the sidewalk,” Windisch said. “Some even have to wait [on] the street.”
Director of USC Transportation Anthony Mazza said the university is waiting on approval from the city in order to receive a permit to build these shelters.
“We have experienced delays with the permit process and hope to get through this process soon without any additional delays,” Mazza said.
Clearance from the city is not the only issue that has stood in the way of beginning the construction.
“We’ve also experienced some delays due to electrical issues,” Mazza said. “However, we believe we have a solar solution that will address these issues.”
After city approval is acquired, students will still have to wait in order for the tram construction to go underway.
“Construction would take about six to eight months,” Mazza said.
For now, the project is still aimed for completion as finances have remained in place to fund the construction.
“We fully intend to move forward,” Mazza said. “However, any additional unforeseen construction costs could hamper the project. Since the project is still in the infancy stage, it is hard to anticipate additional hurdles.”

It’s Thursday morning and USC Cycling Club Race Director Karl Tingwald is a man on a mission. He drives up to the corner of Hayden Avenue and Stellar Drive, located in the heart of suddenly-hip Culver City, and explains that what used to be a section of burned-out, abandoned warehouses has now become a hub of fresh, sometimes offbeat businesses.

But that’s not what Tingwald sees today. In the streets that wind between these businesses, he sees a cycling course, which needs to be set up for Sunday’s race.
“I got 250 of these suckers,” he says, pointing out a box of ‘No Parking/Tow Away’ signs to a group of fellow club cyclists. “Make sure to hit every telephone pole, signpost, fence — we don’t want people pissed.”
Hands converge on the signs and a big roll of twine (“Home Depot was out of wire,” Tingwald says with a shrug), and the cyclists depart on foot to tackle the task of making sure cars don’t park on the race course.
It would be a pretty ordinary pre-race day setup, but this stands as an unprecedented moment: Sunday’s race is the first USC Cycling has ever hosted. To do so, the team has cherry-picked 0.6 miles of prime territory in Culver City and has invested thousands of dollars to hold the event, which will draw hundreds of racers from Southern California and beyond.
The timing of the race falls perfectly in line with the growth of the team’s competitiveness — the team’s president, sophomore John Tomlinson, is the top-ranked male cyclist in the Western Collegiate Cycling Conference, the biggest collegiate cycling conference in the nation. The team is also knocking on the No. 1 position in the ‘national’s team omnium’ category (comprising riders in the ‘A’ category, the fastest group in college cycling) and sits at No. 4 in the overall team category, according to the WCCC.
The cycling team’s history has been an inconsistent one, with the club functioning on-and-off since the ’70s; the current iteration of the club has existed since 2002. But though the team lacks the sheer size and presence of more-established cycling teams such as those from UC Davis or Stanford, its performance has been on an upswing.
Whether the team will be able to sustain this rise is unclear.Tomlinson says most collegiate clubs — including USC’s — suffer from recruiting difficulties.
“Every school struggles with finding talent for cycling,” he says. “It’s usually a four-year cycle of being good and then worse. Schools like Davis have coaches, which helps to keep consistency. We don’t have that.”
For now, the team appears to be in good shape. Much of the credit goes to the intensive practice regimens the club’s top racers participate in, often logging 20 to 30 hours a week in the saddle. The usual path takes club members to Santa Monica Beach, where the path diverges dramatically.
Less-experienced riders turn around and head back to USC, a trek of about 30 miles that takes around two hours to complete. Meanwhile, more-experienced racers head up to the Santa Monica Mountains to tackle some climbs on mountain roads.
These journeys can rack up 70 to 100-plus miles on any given day, taking four to six hours to complete. Though difficult, it’s an experience that can bring a unique sense of liberty in what can be a dangerously stale collegiate schedule.
“The experience is kind of hard to describe, but it’s an intense feeling of freedom — you go out and ride and bring yourself in, just your body on a bicycle,” Tingwald says. “Combined with the incredible views and being out in nature, it’s awesome.”
That rush, Tingwald notes, flies back in full force in racing situations. The irony, of course, is that the process of setting up a race is anything but a rush. The primary problem? Money: Both in how to earn it and how to spend it.
Fundraising can be tricky, and the team primarily lives off the support of sponsors. Helms Bakery and Intelligentsia Coffee comprise the biggest sponsors this year, but it’s not a stable arrangement.
“Sponsors often change each year,” Tingwald says. “The whole Trojan Family thing is huge when we try to find people to help support us financially. That, and personal connections — John [Tomlinson] knows the Intelligentsia Coffee owner, for instance.”
Much of the team’s other revenue comes from the sale of uniform “kits,” which include the team uniform and goodies from sponsors. While they’re popular with alumni and non-team members, the number of kits sold varies each year. Last year, the team struggled financially when rain hampered sales of the kits at Homecoming, one of the most popular sales opportunities.
“We were really scraping the barrel near the end of that season because of that,” Tingwald says.
The fact that the team receives little funding from the university itself also compounds investing into projects such as hosting races. Some collegiate cycling clubs receive upwards of $10,000 from their universities, according to Tingwald; the USC Recreational Club Council gives the cycling club far less — about $2,500 to $3,000 a year.
That makes hosting races a bit of a paradox: Though it can cost several thousand dollars to host a race, the race fees can help to raise money. From every $20 paid per racer, the club takes in $16; $3 goes to USA Cycling for insurance and $1 goes to the WCCC. Regardless, hosting races takes up precious resources and enormous amounts of time: The team began planning the race a year ago, dealing with city government and national cycling organizations to ensure everything came together logistically.
Meanwhile, the club had to dig deep into its pockets to pay for the event’s personnel, including police officers, traffic control contractors, USA Cycling  referees and city officials.
With the race costing about $7,000, Tingwald admits the club will probably lose money, but hopes that it will raise the team’s profile.
“It’s a natural step for us, for marketing and to have a presence,” Tomlinson explained. “USC, for the longest time, didn’t have any presence in the Western Collegiate Cycling Conference.”
Tomlinson wants the club to find more opportunities for funding, as the team doesn’t benefit from athletic scholarships in the way varsity sports do (few universities, in fact, have varsity cycling). Instead, he hopes USC will one day create an academic scholarship for serious cyclists. And staying independent of the university’s varsity sports program comes with advantages, chiefly that the club can host cyclists of all levels and competitive aspirations.
“It’s pretty low-key, and it’s as intense as you want it to be. You can come on team rides for free, even — the problem is that people don’t know about the club at all,” says club member and graduate student Nick Guggemos.
Perhaps Sunday’s race will bolster the inflow of interested cyclists to the club. But beyond that, the team members can’t overstate the race’s broad significance.
“We really feel like we’ve made it by hosting our first race,” Tingwald says. “It’s a big step toward establishing a legacy for our school and our team. And we’ve done it ourselves.”
Great article. Glad to see the cycling club has grown so much and has so many talented and dedicated members. Good luck Sunday!

The USC men’s volleyball team finally returned to the Galen Center Thursday night after a long and disappointing road trip. After dropping their last four games, the Trojans were eager to return home and play in front of a friendly crowd, and, while their opponents, the Cal Baptist Lancers, provided a tough challenge, USC ended its losing skid and improved to 3-5.
Making strides · Sophomore Robert Feathers (above) and the Trojans notched their first victory since a 3-0 defeat over Stanford on Jan. 18. — Sarah Wu | Daily Trojan
The No. 11 Lancers came into Thursday’s game boasting wins over a number of ranked teams, including UC Irvine, Cal State Northridge and UCLA, but the Trojans were more worried about their own performance than the strong start of their opponent. USC’s play from the service line in its most recent matches is much to blame for its lackluster record. However, that was not the case on Thursday.
Cal Baptist began the first set by grabbing an early lead, taking advantage of the Trojans sluggish start. The Lancers had a 9-8 lead when the Trojans sided out, giving the ball to sophomore setter and co-captain Micah Christenson. From there, it was all USC. Christenson notched four aces en route to an 8-0 run for the Trojans. With a commanding 16-9 advantage, the Trojans cruised to an early first set victory, 25-21.
USC rode the momentum of an impressive first set to an early lead, aided by two more aces from Christenson. But while the Trojans continued to play well from the service line, the Lancers were able to keep pace. The score stayed close for most of the set until a pair of crucial kills from freshman outside hitter Austin Rysyk gave USC the set and a 2-0 advantage.
“We really came out and served the daylights out of the ball,” USC head coach Bill Ferguson said. ”I think everybody, Micah especially, came ready to go. It’s the best he’s felt in a long time and you could see it.”
The Trojans appeared to regress to their older form in the third set, however, with seven service errors leading the way to a Cal Baptist comeback. The Lancers took advantage of USC’s errors as well as some clutch play from outside hitter Guilherme Koepp, who notched 14 kills on the night. With that, the Lancers took the third set 25-18, but the Trojans were not going to let this match get away from them.
Early in the fourth set, USC battled back to erase a deficit. It was at that point that the energy of the Trojan bench played a crucial role.
“We recruit character and these guys have a ton of it,” Ferguson said. “They’ve maintained their level of enthusiasm. We’ve been telling them we trust them and we believe in them.”
With the score tied even at 23 apiece, the Trojans surged ahead thanks to a couple of big plays from sophomore outside hitter Cristian Rivera. That set the stage for freshman middle blocker Josh Kirchner to finish off the Lancers with a decisive ace. USC took the set, 26-24, and their first victory in nearly a month.
“We’ve been so close all year and have had short bursts of great but needing one long burst of good to turn the tide,” Ferguson said. “Maybe that ace at the end was part of it,“
The Trojans will face top-ranked BYU at the Galen Center on Saturday at 7 p.m. before taking on the UCLA Bruins next Monday at 8 p.m.

I  never thought I’d see a coach get fired for making his players practice too much.
Wednesday, Feb. 13, 2013 is a day I will never forget.
It was the day that USC baseball coach Frank Cruz had his “contract terminated” for reportedly violating the NCAA’s Countable Athletically Related Activities. For the record, according to the NCAA, here are some of the standards:
– Cannot practice more than four hours a day or 20 hours per week during the season.
– Meetings, practice, film study all count toward the 20 hours
– Required to have at least one day off a week during the season.
– In the offseason, can practice no more than eight hours per week.
Now, listen. I am in no way condoning breaking the rules. I think programs should be run in a clean manner. But to fire a coach for wanting his players to be better? It seems a little excessive.
I understood suspending Cruz. That’s fine. But I think firing Cruz was not the right move. In a culture of sports where performance enhancing drugs, paying recruits and sex scandals seem to be the norm, I think there has to be a line drawn when someone deserves to be fired and when they don’t.  We’re treating practicing in the same manner as sex scandals.
A coach deserves to lose his or her job when he or she puts players in a position to be injured, either mentally or physically. If this was situation like the one that happened recently at Washington State with Mike Leach, I could understand Pat Haden taking the action that he did. Leach reportedly held practices that not only lasted too long, but essentially hazed players by shooting cold water at them and making them practice in freezing conditions in the sand. That is grounds for firing, and he still has a job, somehow.
It’s not fair to completely come down on Haden and the athletic department quite yet. We don’t know all the facts — there could very easily be something that comes out later. But unless Cruz was firing industrial power water hoses at players at 6 a.m., this was not the right move for USC. And not just for the baseball team, for the entire athletic department.
Men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill was fired just a few months ago for poor performance. Honestly, I would have been okay if Cruz had been fired for his less than stellar record while coaching the Trojans, but that wasn’t the reason we were given.
The Twitterverse was in disbelief yesterday, referring to USC as somewhat of an unstable situation, having lost two major coaches recently. This is not the reputation it needs right now. The school is still getting over the Reggie Bush disaster. USC became “the school that cheats.” Now, it’s the school that can’t decide who to keep as coach. A lack of stability in the football program doomed a once-promising 2013 recruiting class for Lane Kiffin. A lack of stability is bound to doom the other two programs, too, especially since the baseball season starts Friday.
Haden has an obligation to self-sanction his programs, especially in the wake of the current football sanctions, but this seems a step too far. There is no way programs are going to survive if coaches get canned right before a season starts for breaking rules on practice times. That just doesn’t seem right.
How, as a player, are you supposed to give it your all when the man in charge of your program was fired? This can’t bode well for the team, no matter how admirably interim head coach Dan Stubbs fills in. The USC athletic department, regardless of policing itself in the wake of previous scandals, is not doing itself favors at this point in time.
Coaches deserve to be fired quite frequently, and normally it is warranted. Poor performance and sketchy practices are reasons to fire someone. But when a coach makes players practice more than they are supposed to? That deserves a slap on the wrist. Cruz did not endanger players by making them practice or holding too many meetings. He simply wanted to get the most out of his players. That doesn’t really strike me as a fireable offense.
 
“Goal Line Stand” runs Fridays. To comment on this story, email Michael Katz at katzml@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com. 
It seems like a suspension might have been in order for Cruz and USC Baseball as opposed to termination.  But in the case of football…when are we going to get back to “USC Caliber” coaching?  Seems like even in our current state, we should be able to attract a coach that meets the standards we have had in place for the past 75 or more years.
From what I understand, Cruz has more integrity in his toenail than Lane Kiffin…..at least Cruz can sleep well at night.
Michael Katz. How clueless are you? Cruz was not fired for wanting his players to be better. He was fired for breaking a critical rule. Sure, wanting his players to be better may have been what drove him to break rules, but that is not why he was fired. Get your facts straight.
Also – Dan Hubbs was not named an interim head coach. He was elevated directly to head coach of this program. Stop your rant and make sure you get your facts right before you keep spewing this nonsense.
Another insignificant move by Haden. He was trying to redeem himself for making Cruz the head coach
w/o a national search for someone who could get this program back to creditability. This was his opportunity
when something happened to give him an excuse to make a bold move. The athletic dept. has become a
source of incompetence lately.
Right now USC has a reputation for not following rules.  I can understand why he was fired. If you need to change the perception of your athletic program you need to be strict in handling violations
With all the crippling sanctions that NCAA handed down for the Football Program, actually keeping Excellent Students from obtaining Scolarships, what would they do with the Frank Cruz problem.
The Football Scolarships were disallowed to folks who had notheing to do with the problem.
Not excessive at all. Message had already been clear to all coaches. Follow the rules, period!

The USC men’s tennis team is looking to defend the Intercollegiate Tennis Association men’s team indoor championship this weekend at the Seattle Tennis Club and the University of Washington.
The No. 2 Trojans are coming off a vanquishing of two top-20-ranked Bay Area schools in No. 13 Cal and No. 19
Eye on the prize · Junior Ray Sarmiento and the Trojans are looking to make a statement against No. 1 Virginia, No. 3 UCLA and others. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Stanford last weekend. Junior Emilio Gomez has led the charge for the Trojans in the early going and his contributions have drawn the attention of collegiate tennis’ governing body. In the ITA’s most recent individual rankings, Gomez jumped from No. 24 to No. 10. Junior Ray Sarmiento, who has been battling an abdominal injury most of this season, held steady in the rankings at No. 12.
USC head coach Peter Smith is confident about his team’s preparation going into the weekend and relishes the challenge of facing the team’s fiercest opposition to date.
“We’re getting better, that’s all we need to do,” Smith said. “[The ITA Indoor Championship] is great for us. We get to see how we match up against the best teams in the country.”
When asked whether it was necessary to run the table at the tournament to make a statement to the rest of the nation, team captain Sarmiento demurred and echoed the sentiments of his coach.
“It’s more important [that] we keep doing the right things on and off the court,” Sarmiento said. “The results will follow.”
He also added that while it would be “nice” to win the tournament, the team’s goal is to peak in May, when the Trojans will try to defend a decidedly more important title: the NCAA Division I Championship.
That isn’t to suggest the Trojans will be taking the competition this weekend lightly: No. 1 Virginia and No. 3 UCLA will be at the tournament in full force in an attempt to gain a psychological foothold on the defending champion Trojans. Leading the charge for the Bruins will be sophomore Marcos Giron, ranked No. 13 in the nation, and junior Adrien Puget, whose play at the Sherwood Collegiate Cup earlier this year landed him a spot in the finals with Sarmiento. Sarmiento ultimately emerged victorious in that matchup, but not before Puget defeated a handful of highly touted Pac-12 players.
For the Trojans, the tournament also offers something they haven’t had the opportunity to do all season: travel. With the exception of the Sherwood Collegiate Cup in Thousand Oaks and a match that was relocated to Riverside because of rain, the Trojans have played all of their matches to open the season at Marks Stadium. For the Trojan tennis team, the players themselves are also their teammates’ best supporters, and traveling allows them to forge bonds with one another.
“[Traveling is] great — we do everything together,” Sarmiento said. “We’re a pretty close-knit team,”
Close-knit also means introducing a new thread that might take a little wrangling; this year, that new thread is freshman Max de Vroome, the only player who wasn’t on the team last year. As the odd man out, de Vroome was dressed up in full costume as DC Comics’ hero The Flash for the Trojans’ flight to Washington.
“He [de Vroome] got plenty of looks [and] pictures,” Sarmiento said. “He signed an autograph, too.”

The USC baseball team figured to have its hands full when opening the season Friday night against No. 23 Cal State Fullerton.
Early challenges · Senior second baseman Adam Landecker has stepped up his leadership in light of head coach Frank Cruz’s firing. — Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Coming off what was the worst season in the worst 10-year stretch in the history of the storied program, the team and the coaching staff knew significant improvements would be needed. Anything close to a repeat of last season’s dismal 23-32 campaign, including a 7-21 conference record, would probably be enough to cause wholesale changes throughout the program.
Turns out, some of those changes happened quite a bit sooner than expected.
USC Athletic Director Pat Haden “terminated” head coach Frank Cruz on Wednesday, less than a week after suspending him for violating NCAA Countable Athletically Related Activities (CARA) rules, which regulate the amount of hours a team can practice under the direction or supervision of its coaches.
“Adhering to all NCAA rules is paramount for each one of our coaches, student-athletes and staff members,” Haden said Wednesday in a statement. “Those who knowingly break NCAA rules are subject to termination.”
Associate head coach Dan Hubbs has been promoted to head coach. Hubbs, a former player at USC, is in his second season with the program, having served as the pitching coach at Cal for 12 years before returning to his alma mater.
“It’s bittersweet,” Hubbs said of his promotion. “Obviously coming back to my alma mater and being the coach here is sort of the dream. But Frank Cruz is a friend, and he gave me the opportunity to come back here. And it’s tough to see this happen to a friend.”
Hubbs and the team were informed of the decision by Haden and the rest of the athletic department brass — including Steve Lopes, Mark Jackson and J.K. McKay — just prior to practice on Wednesday. And all involved seem to be taking the situation in stride.
Cruz posted a statement on his Twitter on Wednesday night, saying “I want to thank USC for the opportunity to coach such a storied program. All of my efforts were aimed at returning USC to greatness, both on and off the field. The Trojan family deserves and demands nothing less. I am responsible for recording all practice hours and for the required compliance. Any oversight was unintended. I thank the USC family, USC Athletics, alumni, players & parents for an extraordinary experience and I wish the team & our recruits success.”
As for the team, the loss of the head coach two days before the season opener is jarring. But the resolution is something everyone values.
“Whatever happened, I’m just glad we can put it all behind us and move forward,” junior catcher Jake Hernandez said. “We’re all just excited to play ball.”
Neither the players nor the coaching staff expects much to change with Cruz’s departure.
“We’ve got a really together group of guys here,” fifth-year senior outfielder Greg Zebrack said. “When I first started here, we had a lot of high-profile players and top draft picks, and we don’t really have that anymore. But that makes for more of a team.”
That sentiment is echoed by all involved, including Hubbs.
“We’ve had some guys really step up as leaders throughout all this,” Hubbs said. “We’re a coach down right now, and so it’s going to be up to some of the older guys to help out a bit more in practice.”
Hubbs specified senior second baseman Adam Landecker and junior shortstop James Roberts — both entering their third year as starters — as players who he has seen doing just that.
“We’ve got a really youthful team,” Hubbs said. “Especially on the mound.”
Junior pitcher Bobby Wheatley, who has pitched just 38 2/3 innings in his college career, is currently tapped as the Friday night starter. Sophomore pitcher Wyatt Strahan and his 26 1/3 innings of experience is set to start on Saturday, while true freshman pitcher  Kyle Twomey is slated for Sunday.
The starting catcher is sophomore Garrett Stubbs, while sophomore Dante Flores is set to start at first base. In the outfield, the Trojans will start a pair of true freshmen in Turner Clouse and Timmy Robinson.
“We’ve got some promise,” Hubbs said. “If we play well, we have a very good chance to beat anybody. But we have to play well and we have to execute. Because it will be tough for us to grind out wins when we’re not.”

It’s odd to think that the Die Hard franchise started with a film based on a script that was an unofficial sequel to Frank Sinatra’s The Detective. The movie was passed over by Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone and instead starred an actor who at the time was mostly known for his role on a cop dramedy on ABC. For a film with such an odd background, it would turn the character of John McClane into one of the staples of the action genre and turn Bruce Willis into the quintessential, everyman action star.
Guys and guns · John McClane (Bruce Willis) reconnects with his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) to join forces and stop a nuclear weapons heist. The narrative of their relationship is one of the film’s strongest points. – Courtesy of Frank Masi
A Good Day to Die Hard certainly has the right attitude and keeps the action at a brisk pace, but the question to ask yourself going into it — and even after seeing it — is this: What actually makes a Die Hard movie different from any other action film?
The previous film, Live Free or Die Hard, had a number of issues, the core of which had to do with the PG-13 rating that restrained the main character. It also made McClane into some sort of “super cop,” a move that diminished what was appealing about him in the first place. Despite that, the film ended up being the most successful film of the franchise, in particular with international audiences.
That being said, bringing the franchise to Russia, of all places, might seem a bit jarring for a guy like John McClane, who, despite foiling scheme after scheme, is still just a regular guy from Jersey. To suddenly be caught up in international politics is a bit much. Drawing McClane to the Motherland is the news that his son Jack (Jai Courtney), with whom John has an estranged relationship has been arrested in Moscow for shooting down an associate to Chagarin, a high-ranking but corrupt defense secretary.
In typical McClane fashion, however, John arrives just as Jack is escaping with Yuri Komarov (Sebastian Koch), a political prisoner who might hold information that could take down Chagarin and the Russian military complex. As it turns out, Jack is actually an agent working with the CIA who wants to obtain the information that Komarov has. John’s arrival sabotages the entire operation and puts father and son on the run and on their own in enemy territory — not exactly the family reunion either one was expecting.
Things proceed in the expected fashion, with John being the delightful prick that he’s always been. The film also incorporates the classic details that fans have come to expect — elaborate and destructive set pieces, the banter between the two McClanes, the big twist in the third act, and the now-legendary Yippie-Ki-Yay catchphrase that has been featured in every Die Hard.
So going back to the initial question: What makes a Die Hard movie different from other action films, and does this film accomplish that distinction?  If you go back to the ’80s, the action genre was mostly dominated by giant supermen like Schwarzenegger or ridiculously fit specimens like Jean-Claude van Damme. However, McClane was just a regular guy. He cursed, made mistakes, got angry, had a troubled marriage back home and was just a person that always found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.
So does this film achieve that McClane touch? In a way it does, but not entirely. The film is very short, running about 97 minutes, which is a good half-hour shorter than the previous entry. At times, it feels more like a montage or a “best of” album. It definitely hits the mark, but in a clinical sort of way — like that of a person completing a checklist.
One good aspect of the film is that the pace of the action is very visceral and raw, particularly the ridiculous car-chase scene throughout Moscow. And the relationship between John and his son holds the film together, even though, with the limited runtime, we don’t really know what compelled him to not only cut off communication with his dad, but also his mom and his sister Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).
Courtney keeps up nicely with Willis, who seems much more invested in this installment than in the fourth one. He seems to have found the right mix between brawn and snippy. It’s interesting that the producers were initially looking at someone like Aaron Paul, who plays Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad, for the part of Jack, but decided to go with Courtney since he’s a lot more believable as a CIA-trained combatant than Paul would’ve been.
Without spoiling anything, the antagonists, or at least the real ones, aren’t what you would consider memorable, which is a shame considering the best Die Hard film — the first and third installments — have the best villains. There’s no one like Hans Gruber in this feature, which is a shame.
So is this film any good? Depends what you’re looking for. If you’re looking for a quick, visceral action-packed flick for President’s Day weekend, then this film accomplishes that nicely. But strictly as a Die Hard film, it certainly gets everything you’d expect out of one but that’s about as far as it goes.
It’s like watching a band from the 1980s: great job for still rocking, but you only like the band for its old songs and none of its new ones.

Though Valentine’s Day was this week, Cupid apparently came early, showering lots of love for Identity Thief this past weekend. The comedy managed to steal $34.5 million, earning more than Melissa McCarthy’s Bridesmaids ($26.2 million) and Jason Bateman’s Horrible Bosses ($28.3 million). This feat was especially impressive considering that the storm Nemo essentially shut down the Northeast under several feet of snow, which could’ve taken up to 15 percent off of the final gross.
With Nemo starting to clear, it seems that things have warmed up for new releases this week as well: The weekend seems to have something for just about everyone. Taking advantage of Valentine’s Day, three of the films opened on Thursday to give them the benefit of a five-day weekend. Those films are A Good Day to Die Hard; Beautiful Creatures, a new supernatural romance; and Safe Haven, the latest flick based on a Nicholas Sparks novel. There’s also the sci-fi animated film Escape from Planet Earth from the Weinstein Company, which premieres Friday.
The newest film in the action franchise, A Good Day to Die Hard sees the return of John McClane. The action flick is not the typical genre seen during the middle of February and, because of that, it has the advantage of being the first action blockbuster of the year.
Additionally, though the reception of the fourth Die Hard wasn’t the best, the film still managed to be the highest-grossing of the series, showing that audiences are still interested in the franchise. The fourth film took advantage of the nostalgia factor of the series and the Independence Day boost.
Besides, it’s not like Bruce Willis hasn’t been in action films lately. In fact, he was just in Looper, one of the most critically acclaimed action films in years. So seeing him in a fourth sequel seems like a step down. However, this film does have a few unique elements to bring in the crowd, such as the new location (Russia, of all places), his son Jack (played by Jai Courtney) and the return to an ‘R’ rating. At the end of the weekend, expect a five-day total around the higher 40s, giving it the biggest opening of the year so far.
This weekend will also see the opening of Safe Haven, a new romance starring Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel. The true star, though, is Nicholas Sparks, the writer behind noteworthy romances such as Dear John, The Last Song, The Lucky One and The Notebook, probably the most beloved and cried-over romance film of the past 20 years.
Even if his movies go through every single cliche and manipulation possible, it’s a winning formula, as each of those brought more than $60 million. What those films had, however, were recognizable stars. Though the two leads in this one are certainly recognizable, they wouldn’t exactly be considered need-to-watch celebrities.
Still, Safe Haven is a romance flick released on Valentine’s Day, so it’s in a great position to be the No. 1 choice for couples and girls (and guys) just looking for a good cry. Though it’s a guarantee that something heartwrenching and out of left field will happen in the third act, as past Nicholas Sparks movies have shown, there’s a sizable audience that just gobbles this stuff up. Expect a five-day weekend slightly over $20 million.
Perhaps beating itself up for passing over both Twilight and The Hunger Games, Warner Bros. is hedging their bets on Beautiful Creatures, a supernatural romance based on the book series that began in 2009. To say that it’s trying to be the next Twilight is a given, as the film practically looks like a spinoff, just with Emmy Rossum, Jeremy Irons and Viola Davis (what is she doing here?).
Though it’s assumed that there will be a strong fanbase for this series and that the film will reap the benefits of its fanbase having a four-day weekend to see the film, you can’t help but be reminded of I Am Number Four, which was another Twilight-esque fantasy that tried to launch over President’s Day weekend back in 2011 but failed. This one will likely see a similar result, bringing it right under $20 million over the weekend.
Just last week, the Weinstein Company moved the Escape from Planet Earth debut from Feb. 14 to Feb. 15, which likely shows how confident they are in the film. The animated flick looks and feels like a cheaper version of 2009’s Planet 51, which looked pretty cheap to begin with. The only thing going for it is that it’s the first new PG-rated film since Christmas. Even with that, this likely won’t push past $10 million.
Either way, this weekend there’s something for everyone.  Action for the boys, romance for the tearjerkers, supernatural romance for the teenager girls, and animation for the parents that don’t know any better.

Last Tuesday, Russia began a stand for health by partially passing one of the most stringent smoking bans in Europe, which would outlaw all smoking in public places. The proposal sailed through the State Duma — the lower house of Parliament — but will have to pass in the upper house and earn President Vladimir Putin’s signature before it becomes law. If enacted, there is no doubt that this legislation will be a challenge for a country of 43.9 million smokers — or 40 percent of its population, according to The Raw Story.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
The ban is a big step in the right direction for the health of the nation and perhaps serves as a harbinger of a healthier world to come, but it also might not work because of its heavy-handed approach.
The fact that Russia, home to the largest tobacco market after China according to The Washington Post, is spreading its wings for health reform illustrates the heightened sense of public health urgency worldwide. Taking into consideration that 400,000 Russians die a year from smoking, the issue is no joke. The legislation is acting upon a legitimate issue in need of change, and its heart is in the right place. This is about protecting public health and carrying out civic responsibility.
The ban’s harshness, however, leaves the quesiton of its efficacy in the air.
If passed, the ban will go into effect June 1. According to BBC News, on that day, smoking will be prohibited within 15 meters of stations, airports, metro stations and ports. It will also be banned from workplaces, playgrounds, beaches and entrances to apartment blocks. On June 1, 2014, the policy will go one step further, banning smoking from long-distance trains, ships, hotels, restaurants, bars, cafes, shops, markets and subway platforms. A minimum retail price will be set for tobacco and advertising will restricted.
That leaves very few convenient places for citizens to smoke, essentially confining smokers to small areas that could be out of the way, and affecting tobacco prices for the worse. But to sidestep the problems this kind of heavy-handed legislation always brings, the ban must really embody a change of heart and mentality in the Russian people rather than force them to change too rapidly. For a country where one in three people are smokers, the jump might be a bit too drastic to swallow.
Rather, the ban needs to make way for a more realistic solution, allowing a little leeway to make sure the abrupt change will not spark an underground market that would counter and exacerbate the issue at hand. If banning takes place in such a short time, where do authorities expect the smokers will go? Will smokers simply cut back just because the law pushes them to?
With so many smokers in one country, the best policy might be to go slow on this change and ease it in first with designated zones for a longer time span than one year.
Aside from baby steps, this type of sweeping reform takes a change of culture, not just a change of policy. The difficulty of reducing smoking in Russia goes back to the desires of its people. Enforcement will be particularly difficult — police officers themselves often smoke in uniform in public, according to The Raw Story. Ultimately, the smoking ban is one way to spark this change in attitude, but ultimately, it’s the people themselves that will decide that it’s time to quit.
This issue digs deep into the bone, and the mentality of urgency and a full understanding of smoking’s dark side must come to light, not just in Russia, but in the world at large.
Not surprisingly, the United States is the largest tobacco market after China and Russia. Yet here, the fight is strong. Organizations, such as the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and California’s Clean Air Project, have taken strides to fight smoking and its harmful health effects, such as the Great American Smokeout, a day for smokers to convene, stop smoking for the day and resolve to quit. And the L.A. City Council in 2010 extended the city’s smoking ban to outdoor terraces.
But though the sentiment of the Russian policy is noble, the government needs to come up with a better plan, one that implements individual bans over time instead of all at once. Completely banning the act will only breed resentment in smokers instead of actually motivating people to quit.

Following a court decision last month that sentenced 21 people to death over a football riot in which 74 revelers died, the City of Port Said found itself under the crushing force of rioters protesting the decision.
Port Said is not the only city suffering from protests. Egyptians took to the streets of Cairo, Alexandria and many other cities to protest the Muslim Brotherhood, a faltering economy, falling foreign investment, high poverty rates and a general decline in hope for the future.
Egypt’s President Mohamed Morsi, who won the first openly democratic elections in Egypt, has unfortunately been incapable of finding a way to end these riots, mostly because of the fact that he seems to have forgotten the Arab Spring revolutions that brought him to power in the first place.
Morsi’s responses to this point have been wholly inadequate in addressing the continuing problems of the Egyptian governmental system. Egypt is obviously experiencing a crisis of legitimacy and a perpetual cycle of shaky governments. As the crisis continues, political protests occur and governments are less able to provide the basic state functions for the people.
Since the protests began, Morsi has reduced the power of the courts and legislature in a bid to increase his own power within the government. The military has also taken physical action, rolling out tanks and tear gas. Morsi has also declared a state of emergency in various cities, most notably Port Said. In response, Port Said’s citizens are now calling for independence from the Egyptian state over the abuses of power by the president, causing even more discord.
Morsi’s decision to declare states of emergency and to meet rioters with tanks and tear gas is exactly the wrong way to address the demands of otherwise well-intentioned protestors. As Australian counter-insurgency expert David Kilcullen writes in his book The Accidental Guerrilla, responding to calls for change with excessive force disproportionally harms the civilian population. As the violence from the ruling power — in this case, the Egyptian government — increases, then otherwise peaceful and moderate civilians are driven to extremism. Morsi’s actions are now only creating more political protest and violence, and Morsi must immediately reverse his decisions on the use of force to preserve the Egyptian state.
In addition, Morsi needs to listen to his protestors and turn his attention and the resources of Egypt toward fixing the fundamental problems within the country today. A democratically governed Egypt would give Morsi the opportunity to create economic development by creating a country desirable for business headquartering. Because of Egypt’s close proximity to the Suez Canal, the country can become a crossroads of trade and ideas between Europe, Asia and Africa. Capitalizing on this location would give Egypt a fantastic opportunity to grow economically, but only if Egypt’s people are happy and finally receive the democracy that they were promised. If Morsi continues to rule the country with hostility to progress, free expression and law and order, then businesses will flee from a fertile economic environment that could have been.
Morsi needs to move away from his reactive policies of repression and toward progressive policies of fair justice and economic development. Only then can the Arab Spring finally bloom into a just and prosperous summer.

Relevant to this discussion too:
“The official media narrative is that these differences are the results of eons of oppression,
checkpoints and blockades. Fair enough. But then why does the IMF put Israel’s
GDP Per Capita well ahead of the oil rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia?
Saudi Arabia has no Israeli checkpoints, no Israeli soldiers or planes flying
overhead. It has wealth literally pouring out of the ground with a fifth of the
world’s petroleum reserves. And yet the IMF puts it 13 places behind Israel and
the World Bank puts it 8 places behind Israel. The only Muslim countries with a
better GDP Per Capita rating than Israel are small monarchies drowning in oil. 
The non-oil Muslim countries who are closest to Israel are Malaysia and
Lebanon, 32 and 33 places behind Israel. Both countries also have sizable
non-Muslim populations. Muslims make up only 50 percent of Lebanon and only 60
percent of Malaysia. 
38 places below Israel is Turkey, which until recently was a secular country
and actually has a statistically significant atheist population. And that’s it.
Below that we fall off a cliff into places like Belarus, South Africa and
Grenada; all of whom still have better GDP Per Capita rates. No Muslim country
without oil has a better GDP Per Capita than a Muslim country that has sizable
Christian or Buddhist minorities.”
The only way for the Arab Spring to bloom into a just and prosperous future is for it to leave Islam behind.  Islam destroys individuals, their initiative, their creativity, their thirst for knowledge.  Until Islam becomes a relic of a foregone era Egypt – and the rest of the Muslim world – will suffer apace.

After deliberations that began at 9:30 p.m. Tuesday and concluded around 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, the Undergraduate Student Government elections commission determined both presidential tickets had committed violations of the elections code.
Matt Arkfeld and Alex Cascante were cited for not using the “Vote On” logo on their campaign shirts, the elections and recruitment committee wrote in its decision. USG Election Code article VII, section D2 stipulates that all candidates are required to display a “Vote On” logo on their campaign shirts.
Campaigning · USG Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates Matt Arkfeld-Alex Cascante (left) and Christian Kurth-Ryan Park were forced to remove all of their campaign materials from Trousdale Parkway by 8 a.m. Wednesday after complaints were filed against both tickets. The Arkfeld-Cascante were barred from campaigning Wednesday between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m on Trousdale Parkway. — Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
Arkfeld and Cascante were also cited for violating Election Code article VI, sections A, B and C for distributing campaign photographs online during the research period, which is prior to Feb. 4 at midnight, when campaigning officially began.
Christian Kurth and Ryan Park were cited for violating article II, section A3 and article IX, section C by communicating with a currently seated USG member, who was copied on an email between supporters. They were also cited  for violating article IX Sections E and F by implying that Program Board, the Black Student Assembly and USG endorsed the candidates in using USG’s pin maker to make campaign pins and using USG’s oversized Tommy Trojan logo.
The sanctions stipulate that both presidential and vice presidential tickets must remove all campaign material along Trousdale Parkway for the remainder of the campaign period. The material had to be removed by Wednesday at 8 a.m.
The Arkfeld-Cascante ticket and their team members will also not be allowed to campaign Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Trousdale Parkway between Child’s Way and 34th Street or in front of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The two sets of complaints were filed on Tuesday. Kurth said earlier that day 11 Kurth-Park signs were removed or stolen from Trousdale without the campaign’s permission.
“It was not our intention to turn this into a campaign of people sanctioning each other,” Kurth said. “We’re running a very clean campaign but, when there’s sabotage happening, we had to take action. This is very important to me.”
Arkfeld said the photographs for his campaign were not published online before campaigning began and the “Vote On” logo was on the T-shirt design sent to the printer, but was not printed accordingly.
“It was an honest mistake and we handled it accordingly,” Arkfeld said. “We were very transparent and upfront about it.”
Cody Rapp, campaign manager for the Kurth-Park ticket and a former Greek senator, filed the official complaint against the Arkfeld-Cascante ticket. The Arkfeld-Cascante ticket brought the complaint against the Kurth-Park ticket.
Any USC student who is not on the USG elections commission is allowed to file a complaint. After a complaint is filed, the elections commission takes a vote to determine if it is worthy of having a trial. If the commissioners decide it is worthy, a trial is set at a time when all parties can meet.
“We have this process in order to guarantee a fair race and make sure that people are held accountable,” said Alex Sellers, co-director of USG elections and recruitment. “Then, each candidate has the opportunity to do their best.”
Sellers noted that violations during presidential campaigns have occurred in past elections.
“Violations have occurred previously,” Sellers said. “But they have not happened to this magnitude before. We have never had so many complaints filed in one day.”
Despite the sanctions, Kurth said he will not let the penalties to deter their campaign efforts.
“We will be campaigning [Wednesday],” Kurth said. “We’ve been out here every single day and longer than anyone else.”
Arkfeld plans to continue campaigning as well.
“We’re trying to have a positive experience for both parties and play by the rules,” Arkfeld said. “We want to maintain honesty and a genuine attitude as we have this entire election.”
Online voting for the election closes Thursday night at 8 p.m.
Correction; A published version of this incorrectly stated that Arkfeld said the photographs for his campaign were published online before campaigning began, but they were not published online before campaigning began. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Not to worry TT, the row is also being punished for these violations as well.
It seems to me that the violations by Kurth and Park are much more severe than the ones from Matt and Alex. It disappoints me that the sanctions do not account for this discrepancy.
