President-elect Divya Jakatdar and vice-president-elect Michelle Lu announced their cabinet appointments for the 2023-24 school year at Tuesday night’s Undergraduate Student Government senate meeting. 
The nominations include David Martinez as chief of staff, Khalil Daniels as chief financial officer, Mustafa Ali Khan as chief communications officer, Kayla Parayno as chief programming officer, Kaleb Stephens as chief diversity officer and Emilia Bletsas as speaker of the senate. 
“All of these candidates will work to foster a positive environment in the office and shut down all negativity,” Lu said. “We can confidently say that these candidates’ views align with our platform of ACT — accessibility and affordability, community and transparency — and each fit in a puzzle that makes a power blend.”
The senate voted to approve all of the cabinet nominations.
USG hosted two restaurant crawls in February that took students off campus and provided them with free meals across 11 local businesses in South Central. As a symbol of gratitude for the businesses, Committee of External Affairs chair Monica Rodriguez drafted a senate bill for legislative funding for 10 gift baskets and thank you cards totaling $923.65. 
President Hannah Woodworth vetoed the bill, which was introduced last week, saying it “lacked a cost breakdown.”
“Without these details, I could not in good faith sign the bill,” Woodworth wrote. “I encourage all Senators to consider how this is an unprecedented use of legislative funding. USG does not provide gift funding for any other USG-vendor relationships.” 
Rodriguez said she has been working to host a restaurant crawl for the last two years, and the gift baskets will help maintain the relationship between the restaurants and USG for those who want to host another restaurant crawl in the future. 
“It’s an incredible way to give back to the community,” said senator Yoav Gillath. “I think the fact that precedent only matters when we’re trying to help the residents of the surrounding L.A. community is pretty weird to me … I helped out with this restaurant crawl and saw the tremendous positive impact it did have … We’re not just in South Central, we’re part of it. I think it’s about time to start acting like it.”
The senate bill failed to reach a two-thirds majority to override the president’s veto, with six votes in favor and six votes against the approval of legislative funding.

There’s nothing more exciting than the start of spring in Los Angeles. The sunny streets and bright blue skies make it easy to forget one of the city’s stormiest winters this year. Like most Angelenos, I’m ecstatic to be able to walk to class without my boots and umbrella, but I already miss the produce of the season. To me, Californian winters are all about the oranges. These three months offer oranges that strike the perfect balance between sweet and sour.  
As I think back to those wonderful oranges, it’s easy to forget how those fruits arrive in my local supermarket. Though harvesting practices vary, farm workers are a key component of the harvesting process. Without them, there are no perfect winter oranges.
In 2012, an investigation of the orange groves in Southern Italy reported that many migrant workers were only paid 25 euros for one day’s work — before gangmasters took deductions for transport and lunch. Workers were living in horrible conditions. Some were in camps with no running water or electricity while others were sleeping in abandoned farmhouses or outside. Without employment contracts, laborers had no way to demand better conditions.
This isn’t a story unique to Italy, oranges or the 21st century. The agriculture industry has a history of labor exploitation, often taking advantage of migrant workers who have few resources to fight back again unethical labor practices.
According to Operation Blooming Onion, a multi-agency federal investigation, more than 100 people from Mexico and Central America were smuggled into Georgia, forced to work on onion farms — receiving only 20 cents per bucket in compensation.
The indicted farmers made more than $200 million through this scheme. Not only were laborers overworked and undercompensated, they were also forced to spend their limited income to pay for food, transportation and cramped housing that often lacked plumbing and access to safe water. On the job, workers who stepped out of line were threatened with guns, torture and deportation. Because of the egregious conditions, at least two people died and several others were raped, kidnapped, sold to other farms or faced death threats against themselves and their families. 
Immigrant workers, such as those in Georgia’s onion farms, make up for 73% of America’s agricultural labor force and just under 50% of these laborers are undocumented. Though our economy and food security rely on their work, undocumented workers have no nationwide labor protections, leaving them more likely to face employer exploitation without any form of recourse.
We accept the abuse of undocumented immigrants and write off the plight of undocumented workers as if immigrating without paperwork is deserving of brutal labor practices that amount to cruel and unusual punishment.
H-2A visas are intended to curb the number of undocumented farm workers, allowing immigrants to legally work short-term with protection and legal aid if their employers are not following labor laws. However, in 2019, less than 4% of the agricultural workers were given visas. Given how limited the program is, the promised protection is nothing more than superficial.
While farm worker abuse is a widespread phenomenon, it’s particularly acute in California where the largest agricultural-output value in the country resides. Though recent state legislation extends labor laws to undocumented immigrants, workers risk deportation to fight for the rights they were promised.
The average Californian can separate themselves from farm workers enough to feel unaccountable for this abuse. By othering these communities, we eliminate any motivation to fight alongside laborers for fair agriculture practices — enjoying our oranges while workers face conditions akin to modern slavery.
Like most social issues, this problem is far too large to solve in 700 words for the University newspaper. It will require immigration policies that recognize the importance of migrant workers and legislation that recognizes a universal right to labor protection regardless of one’s citizenship status. Though the necessary changes are big, there are ways for each of us to start small. From amplifying the voices of agriculture activists to purchasing produce from ethical farms, we make choices every day that can bring us a step closer to an equitable society.

As someone who has grown up surrounded by Christianity, I’m used to the rhetoric. I know the stories and I’m accustomed to the belief system. However, I’ve never identified as a Christian, or as a religious person in general. Yet, though I’m familiar with religion, proselytizers — those who try to persuade others to accept or believe their own religion or politics — still make me uncomfortable. In my and my friends’ experiences, they’re impossible to stay away from, especially when you’re rushing to make it to class. 
I feel like every spring I experience the constant and relentless handing-out of religious flyers on every corner surrounding USC Village and campus. It may be hard to pinpoint exactly how many of these proselytizers there are around USC grounds, but their presence, in my opinion, prevents the University from truly being an inclusive community — one where every person can feel welcome, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, race, etc. 
In most cases, they just want to invite you to their Bible study or church group, which is innocent enough. However, the issue for me arises when they elongate the conversation even after you’ve clearly expressed disinterest, which has happened about every time I’ve been approached. There is a difference between respecting another person who has different beliefs than you and trying to change that person because they have different beliefs than you. 
One is cordial. The other is not.
Sometimes, flyers or pamphlets are handed out in accordance with these invitations to prayer or Bible studies. Occasionally, like many other students, I’ll just take the paper to be nice. But there have been instances when the material being handed out was flatout offensive. I’ve been given pamphlets that list depression, homosexuality, premarital sex and “being emo” as offenses necessitating Jesus. 
It’s important to note that USC Village is widely regarded as a public space, where interactions like these aren’t that peculiar. However, it’s when these instances move onto campus that I become weary, especially when the proselytizers aren’t current USC students. These actions do sometimes really take away from my day-to-day experiences as a student here.
You could ask me to not take it so seriously, that a few-minutes-long exchange shouldn’t get to me like it does. But I just can’t shake the bothersome feeling that it gives me every time a proselytizer tells me that my lifestyle is wrong and that, in their eyes, I need help. 
It’s not someone else’s job to judge what I need help with and when; in fact, it’s just plain offensive. It’s okay to disagree with my lifestyle choices — I likely don’t agree with theirs — but that doesn’t mean I feel moved to hand out propaganda that’s meant to change the way people live in a crude and unsympathetic manner. These actions don’t instill a sense of community or welcoming, that’s for sure. 
I also feel pretty confused at the fervent efforts of proselytizers in a city where just about 65% of the population identify as Christian, about the same as the national percentage. Maybe you could argue that USC is more religiously diverse than the rest of Los Angeles, and therefore constitutes a bigger conversion target, what with all the heathens that study within its confines. But, when looking up religious organizations on EngageSC, 22 Christian affiliates come up. On the other hand, there are only four student organizations that are affiliated with Islam, Judaism, Hinduism or Buddhism — the other most commonly practiced world religions — combined. 
It’s hard to understand who these proselytizers are trying to convert when the majority already believes what they do. 
If someone is really passionate about their beliefs, then I don’t fault them for trying to share those beliefs with the people around them. But it can be difficult to keep an open mind when the loudest voices are those on the pamphlet telling me I’m going to hell for being depressed or the ones with the megaphones damning me for the same reasons right before a football game.
I want to be able to see proselytizers as those doing work in good faith (no pun intended), but I need people who may subscribe to these ideologies to know that their efforts to change my beliefs make it difficult for me to go about my life. This system of proselytism can never incite a true and meaningful conversation, it just creates further divide and less of a sense of belonging for USC’s diverse religious community. 
Correction: A previous version of this article was accompanied by an illustration which depicted a young woman being presented pamphlets emblazoned with religious symbols. The presence of one of these symbols, the Star of David, wrongfully implied that Jewish proselytizers were common. This is incorrect, as proselytism is seen as offensive in Judaism, and as such Jewish proselytizers are highly uncommon. Jewish organizations on and around USC’s similarly do not attempt to recruit or convert students. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

STC Dano, also known as Daniel Novikov, is one of USC’s upcoming talents looking to entertain the masses with their tunes. Ignoring social standards and forging new paths has been a through line in the discography of the Trojan rapper. 
The sophomore music industry major has been making music for as long as he can remember. It’s followed him throughout his life as he’s traveled around the world, living in Panama, Russia and Atlanta but always calling Los Angeles his home. With influences ranging from The Temptations to Wizkid to XXXTentacion to his parents’ homeland Eastern European music, a career in music has always been in his mind and it’s what he’s passionate about.
While his career is still in its infancy, STC Dano has some feats that are nothing to scoff at. He was an opening act for rising Inland Empire rapper GirlzLuhDev, and having one of his tracks, “Never Fold” reached nearly 60,000 streams on Spotify.  STC Dano talked about the excitement he felt about opening for GirlzLuhDev as well as what he wanted to do with it.
“I was just like, how do I throw a dope performance? How do I do a great opening set? But also just how do I make it so that when people will come to my set, they’re like, ‘Oh shit, I actually want to check out this guy.’ So I actually want to create performances that people remember,” STC Dano said.
STC Dano said that his connection with mutual friends and artists Iz LaMarr and YVS Village are what put him in a position to open for GirlzLuhDev. Having performed at several other smaller venues around the area, STC Dano caught the eye of Iz LaMarr, an event planner for his own company, Roaring 20s, who was coordinating a lineup for his next event. Lamarr brought along STC Dano to join his event.
In a testament to STC Dano’s willingness to connect with other creatives, his producer, Mike Jones, also known as MikeFrom31st, has been one of his biggest supporters throughout his journey. The Broward, Florida. native has developed a strong relationship with STC Dano, allowing them to bond over not just their musical abilities but also their personalities. Jones expressed the importance of creating a solid partnership when working with artists as their producer.
“For me, bro, that’s everything. Like with anybody I work with. If I don’t feel a good connection, that’s more like a family or like a brother or sister or, like, genuine vibes, I don’t really want to work with you,” Jones said. “When it comes down to hanging out with you and being with you in person and locking in a studio for ten plus hours, I don’t want to be with somebody that I can’t feel like I can joke around with or go grab food with.”
MikeFrom31st and STC Dano bond is exemplary of STC Dano’s attitude of wanting to work with whoever and create artistic work. Their friendship has allowed the two to experiment on their sound and production, as their comfortability with one another leads them into different pockets of music. 
“Pertaining to Dano, every song he does is a different genre. I think, like what you hear is is what he feels like releasing that day. You know what I’m saying? Like he has hyperpop, he has trap, he has singing, he has dancehall, like he has everything,” Jones said.
STC Dano has dabbled in a variety of genres, especially in recent months, having released a jersey club inspired track, “Buss it Open,” and a dance hall track, “the way you move (suru).” However, much of his earlier work would be tied to more of an R&B and hip-hop style with a melodic style of rapping similar to that of PnB Rock and Ty Dolla $ign.
Among other artists, STC Dano said he considers XXXTentacion as an inspiration that has molded his creativity and how he wants to portray himself as an artist as well as the route he wishes to take with his music. The diversity of XXXTentacion’s catalog, from “Look At Me!” to “Jocelyn Flores,” is something that STC Dano aspires to have throughout his career and not limit himself to just one sound and one message.
STC Dano’s desire to experiment with all types of music becomes clearly evident when realizing that the STC in his stage name stands for “subject to change.” He chose this name and gave it this meaning so that people can’t place him in a box and to keep them on their toes about what’s next in his career. 
His friend Spencer Browne, a fellow sophomore music industry major, met STC Dano in a class at USC and connected there, with Browne working as STC Dano’s publicist. Browne is also an artist, who goes by the name Malcolm Mark, and was looking to get into music through multiple avenues, which is how he crossed paths with STC Dano. It was through a Public Relations class where the assignment was to work as a publicist for an artist at USC, that the two connected. 
“The main assignment [for the course] is that we got to find an artist at USC and work with them,” Browne said. “I’m asking around. I’m like, ‘Do y’all know anyone that’s like super dope, that I could work with’ and a bunch of my friends were like, ‘You got to hit up Dano.’ And so I found him, I DM’d him. I’m like, ‘Let’s work,’ and he’s like ‘Let’s lock it in.’”
When asked about STC Dano’s personality outside of the music, both Jones and Browne laughed and told of experiences of spending a good time with him while working on their craft. One thing that Browne noted, which all three found hilarious, was while STC Dano was promoting his cypher, he would do so suited in a ramen noodle soup outfit all week — which STC Dano assured he washed everyday. His entertaining demeanor has brought along many opportunities and relationships that he uses to propel himself further musically, all while having a good time. 
Whether it’s roaming around campus in a peculiar outfit or creating tracks in the studio with other artists, STC Dano is one to keep an eye out for. As he and MikeFrom31st prepare more tracks to release in the summer with Browne tagging along for the ride, STC Dano’s willingness to work with anyone, and his personality, can get him far in the industry.

As the tools to create great games are becoming more and more accessible, smaller teams are becoming able to create top-notch indie videogames without the backing of major studios.
One drawback of this market’s growth is that many incredible titles fly under the radar. What if you never played a game absolutely perfect for you — your soulmate, in game form — just because you had no clue it existed, buried under heaps of other titles? 
Worry no more; USC’s game design students are passionate about lesser-known games, and they’d be happy to introduce you.
Identity V
“‘Identity V’ is underrated, specifically because there is a very small player base in America compared to the Asian countries,” said Aya Kimura, a freshman majoring in game development and interactive design. “The gameplay is very unique. It’s a 4v1 competitive game, and there’s a ‘hunter’ and a ‘survivor.’”
Multiplayer survival horror fans may compare “Identity V” to “Dead by Daylight” or “Left 4 Dead,” but there are a few key differences. For one, the art in “Identity V” uses a less realistic style that lacks gore — think “Coraline” (2009), cute but creepy. “Survivors” (the four vulnerable players who have to escape the “hunter”) also have individual abilities. 
“There are about 39 [‘survivors’]. They’re each very unique and have their own mechanics,” Kimura said. 
This variability means you can experiment with playstyles, preventing the game from getting stale. Also important, “Identity V” is free to play for iOS and Android, removing some huge barriers to entry. If you want a fun, spooky experience with friends, no matter where they are or what consoles they have, “Identity V” might be the game for you.
Cloud Gardens
“Cloud Gardens” occupies an interesting space between landscape builder and puzzle game. 
“It’s basically like ‘The Last of Us,’ but a toy used to grow plants,” said Boston Moreland, a sophomore majoring in game development and interactive design. 
Have you ever seen that aesthetic of brutalist, broken-down buildings becoming overgrown? It’s like that, but a game. “Cloud Gardens” has a “sandbox” mode and a “campaign” mode, so you can choose whether to chill out and create your own unique garden or do some engaging puzzles. 
“You just plant plants, water them and they just overtake structures. And once you plant enough plants, you win the level,” Moreland said. “I’ve never heard anyone else talk about it, and it is incredibly relaxing and satisfying.”
If you like creative games with cool graphics or just really love watching the earth take back the land, “Cloud Gardens” might be for you. 
A Hand With Many Fingers
Have you ever wanted to be a journalist or detective on the precipice of discovering something huge? “A Hand With Many Fingers” might just scratch that itch.
“It’s the fantasy of those Watergate or conspiracy movies, except you get to actually be the person controlling it,” said Page Murray, a freshman majoring in game development and interactive design. “In the game, you’re putting together a conspiracy on a corkboard, where you’re drawing threads between different pieces of evidence.” 
“A Hand With Many Fingers” is based on a true story from the Cold War. The story’s reality, combined with unconventional archive-searching gameplay, creates an eerie sense of immersion. If you’re interested in the Cold War or want to feel like you’re in your very own Pepe Silvia meme, check out “A Hand With Many Fingers” and start getting paranoid.
No Straight Roads
“No Straight Roads” is a rhythm action-RPG where you play as two indie rockers trying to defeat an EDM empire. 
“You’re trying to save rock music from pop … But it’s a lot more than that, with all these other game influences,” said Maxwell Hunter, a freshman majoring in game development and interactive design.
At a glance, rhythm game enthusiasts may compare “No Straight Roads”’ action-heavy beat-based gameplay to Tango Gameworks and Bethesda’s critically acclaimed “Hi-Fi Rush.”
“‘No Straight Roads’ actually came out first,” Hunter said. “And I honestly prefer ‘No Straight Roads’ to ‘Hi-Fi Rush’ … It feels a lot more lived-in and more stylized, especially [since] each boss you fight in ‘No Straight Roads’ actually has a different music style.” 
If you like “Hi-Fi Rush” or rhythm games in general, give “No Straight Roads” a try.
“I think since ‘No Straight Roads’ is made by a smaller indie Malaysian company that [it] didn’t get the recognition it deserved,” Hunter said. 
Spiritfarer
In “Spiritfarer,” the player builds a boat to transport and care for spirits as they make their way to the afterlife. For a game about death, though, “Spiritfarer” is a lovely experience.
“The art direction is very beautiful, very surreal … The music is really good,” Hunter said. “I felt myself getting really attached to the characters … You really get to see them grow … so they’re actually ready to leave and move on.” 
If you want to enjoy a serene game and fall in love with well-written characters, “Spiritfarer” might be for you.
“It fills that niche of management cozy games … But then you don’t really hear people bring ‘Spiritfarer’ into the conversation. They usually just say ‘Stardew Valley,’ ‘Animal Crossing,’ things like that,” Hunter said. 
The tastes of game design students are a pretty wild mix, but that just goes to show the huge variety in the current video game market. Hopefully, those recommendations will help with your video game FOMO. In the long term, make friends with some game designers like these USC students; they’ll always have suggestions for new games to try.
Correction: A previous version of the article stated that Cloud Gardens was developed by Trojans. The game has no affiliation to USC. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

It’s a well known fact that when a group or idol becomes famous, they fall victim to an abundance of unsolicited hate. This is especially true for all-women groups and idols — you know, the ones that starve themselves for weeks on end and are forced to wear uncomfortably skimpy outfits? These women and girls are the ones who are berated to the bitter end. Color me surprised. 
This specific topic of “pick-me” hate piqued my interest a year ago when a video IVE’s Jang Won-young ( 장원영) manner of eating a strawberry sparked controversy on social media. For non K-pop fans “pick-me” hate may sound very confusing. In all honesty, I don’t think my explanation will really relieve you of that confusion but, regardless, I’ll do my best.
In case you’ve been sleeping under a rock (I hope it’s comfy), IVE, and more specifically Wonyoung, have dominated every aspect of K-pop since the group’s debut on December 1, 2021. To say the six girls were catapulted into stardom is an understatement. They’re now competing with girl groups that have been out for two or three times as long as they have. 
This explosion of popularity has less to do with raw talent and more to do with impressive marketing and previous popularity. Two of the IVE’s members, Wonyoung and Yujin (유진), are well-known members of the former group IZ*ONE, which disbanded in April 2021. IZ*ONE was composed of the winning girls of an idol competition show, Produce48, which show ranked all competitors based on their talents and visuals. Unsurprisingly, Wonyoung was ranked first at the end of the show in October 2018. 
It’s important to explain the context behind the amount of sheer hatred this poor girl receives. It’s very much a case of “they hate us cause they ain’t us,” except she’s fourth generation K-pop’s “It girl,” and her haters are people who haven’t left their parents’ basement in three days. 
Now, back to the strawberry incident.
The event in question occurred on April 16, 2022, when MBC’s “The Manager” was released to the public eye. This segment was intended to give fans an inside look to the dorm life of IVE, their day-to-day habits and hobbies, etc. It very much gives invasive propaganda, but I digress. 
In the clip, Wonyoung picks up and eats a strawberry with — gasp — two hands and begins to nibble on the end of it. For some reason, this set the internet ablaze, and the accusations of her being a “pick-me” were impossible to stay away from. 
Tweets reposted by Kpopstarz.com in their article about the “issue” include, “Eating with both hands was a little too much,” with similar statements being sprinkled in with claims she was acting “too unnatural” because of the camera.
I don’t know about you, but I would probably not be acting “natural” if there was a camera in my home, but maybe that’s just me. 
To make matters worse, six months later, two members of the girl group ALICE mocked Wonyoung’s strawberry-eating in a vlog. Re-emphasizing the viral moment unnecessarily highlighted the event again and degraded the IVE member, who just turned 18 this past August. 
Other instances in which Wonyoung was attacked for being a “pick-me” include: when she threw the first pitch at a Doosan Bears baseball game, basically every time she’s ever eaten during a livestream, when she drank boba on an idol show and whenever she poses for the camera. Her existence really pisses people off for some reason. 
Unfortunately, Wonyoung is not the only victim in this series of gender-specific harassment. Shin Yu-na (신유나) from ITZY has also fallen into the hands of social media trolls who are convinced that she acts either for the male gaze or to prove to others that she’s just “quirky.” Similarly, Tsuki (츠키) from Billlie apparently also just gives off those vibes simply because of her unique facial expressions during her performances, which I actually adore. 
This is clearly blatant sexism. I just want to get that out of the way in case I haven’t made that abundantly evident already. This “pick-me” rhetoric just proves that no matter what you do or how you do it, if you are a female K-pop idol, chances are, you’re doing something wrong. Breathing? Probably doing it wrong. Same thing goes for posing for the camera. And don’t you dare eat that strawberry. You’ll likely do that wrong, too.

Student Health will offer wellness workshops to help students take preventative steps to mitigate stress and anxiety as students anticipate long study days ahead of finals, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah van Orman said in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Tuesday.
A workshop hosted by the Counseling and Mental Health Services division of Student Health, dubbed “Anxiety Toolbox,” will help students learn to manage cognitive and behavioral symptoms of anxiety, while a separate workshop, “Exploring Your Values and Setting Achievable Goals,” will encourage students to set manageable goals. 
Van Orman stressed the importance of preventative care, especially when it comes to managing anxiety.
“For many people [who think], ‘I don’t need to go to a workshop,’ workshops can actually be incredibly helpful,” Van Orman said. “It’s a one session thing so people can try it out. You don’t have to commit to an ongoing group … we want people to try these sorts of things before they get to the point where they’re feeling really overwhelmed.”
Student Health is also raising awareness about its year-round sexually transmitted infection testing services during STI Testing Week, which takes place from April 9 to April 15.
“We have been promoting getting tested, understanding what the recommendations are, whatever their age, their practices, their partners, because STI testing depends on the individual,” Van Orman said.  
Student Health offers STI testing consultation appointments, which can be made online or by phone. Its website also features an online, self-guided questionnaire that determines the best STI testing specifications for students. Tests can be scheduled with the Student Health clinic via the student portal.
“STI testing week is another way to get the word out, especially [since] students might be heading out for the year, home for the summer or for [an] internship, or somewhere else where they might not have as much access to regular care,” Van Orman said.
As the semester starts to wrap up and schedules get busier, Van Orman also recommended spending more time in nature to encourage physical and emotional well being.
“The connection between our emotional physical well being and the environment is strong,” Van Orman said. “It’s particularly important as our University moves to a position where we are more deeply engaged with sustainability under President Folt.”
Van Orman recommended students try to spend 20 to 30 minutes outside every day as a “nature break” to decompress and reap the benefits of sunlight and vitamin D.
“Even on our campus, there are little spots where you can find nature,” Van Orman said. “My favorite part on campus is the spot between the music school and Annenberg where they have the little sculpture garden, and I can hear the Thornton students … sitting there and listening to the fountain can also make a difference.”
Coronavirus cases have returned to a normal low 32 cases this week, after a slight uptick to 76 cases last week, likely due to post-spring break travels. 
“We’re hoping that means that as we move to the end of the semester … people are not experiencing illnesses,” Van Orman said. “Make sure [to] stay home, get tested [if you] do experience cold and flu symptoms.”

Wait, it’s already April?
How come it feels like time suddenly sped up somewhere during March? It felt like just yesterday we were all going on spring break, and now I’m almost a month away from graduating and leaving USC. 
That can’t be right, there’s no way. I refuse to face the facts. I will keep acting as if the semester just started and therefore have all the time in the world to enjoy my last semester as an undergraduate. Presidents’ Day? Spring break? I can’t wait.
In light of this (recent) extension of my semester, I’ve decided to pick up a couple of time-consuming hobbies. After all, thanks to my limited and constrained schedule over the past years, I’ve barely even had time to get home and cook myself dinner every night. But now, with this expanded semester, I finally have the time to stop and smell the roses, but only the ones I plant. Yes, I started gardening for the first time, believe it or not. I also decided to finally learn how to play chess, and I plan on becoming reasonably good at tennis as soon as I can find someone willing to play with me.
Still, the hardest and most time-consuming hobby I started isn’t any of those. While the things I mentioned are all useful or impressive skills, I of course decided to spend most of my hours obsessing over something with little to no practical value: RTS games.
For those of you who don’t know, RTS — which stands for Real-Time Strategy games — is a genre that requires quick thinking and management prowess. In most of these games, the main gameplay loop revolves around developing your “base,” growing your army and destroying your enemy’s base with it while keeping an eye on your resources (things like food, raw materials, etc). As the name suggests, a lot of the game revolves around the strategies you develop to accomplish the aforementioned goals while also ensuring you survive. Add the fact that there are different levels of buildings, army units with specific advantages and disadvantages and maps with different locations of resources (if not completely random distributions), and you start to get a better picture of these games.
Sound complicated? That’s because it is. And that’s kind of the point.
Compared to other games and genres I cover in this column, RTS games seem to effectively oppose everything I preach. Instead of having a low -skill barrier to attract the most players possible, these games take the opposite road, making themselves extremely difficult to get into. Worse, since the game requires quick thinking and a lot of unit management, they naturally lend themselves to a mouse and keyboard environment, which automatically alienates many casual gamers who don’t have the time or inclination to invest in a gaming computer. And while this wasn’t an intended difficulty on the developers’ part, the now niche status of these games in the west means that whenever you decide to try your luck at an online match, odds are that you’ll be going against someone who has been playing the game for years and is infinitely better than you at virtually everything. 
Unless you have some sort of David versus Goliath complex or enjoy pain, it’s hard to imagine how you can have fun playing games like this. Most people don’t like having to dedicate all their attention to the most minute details and getting curb-stomped online repeatedly when they fail to click the screen as fast as their opponent (I’m not kidding, that is a real competitive edge). And while they were all the rage many years ago, with arguably the most famous series in this genre, “StarCraft,” effectively jump-starting esports in general, they have failed to retain their audience in the west for the reasons I listed and many more. After all, with and gaming becoming increasingly popular and easy to get into, why on earth would someone choose to play a game that is extremely hard?
That is the sort of thinking I, too, carried for most of my life. While I got the opportunity to play some “Age of Empires” and “StarCraft” at my cousins’ house when I was little, none of those experiences were particularly more fun than, say, “The Simpsons: Hit & Run” or any number of other games. And as I grew older, whenever I tried to give them a chance, I would immediately run into all the issues I detailed and quit after five matches or less. 
But with the rising popularity of FromSoftware games, which are also hard albeit in a different way, my tolerance for frustration began to grow larger. And after completing my three runs of “Elden Ring” late last year, I felt like I was finally ready to tackle this insurmountable challenge once again.
And let me tell you, I’m so glad I did.
Don’t get me wrong, I am still losing 99% of the time. But since I decided to buckle down and learn the ins and outs of these games, I found myself having more fun as time went on. 
But the best part about them comes only after you decided to take the plunge. While the skill barrier is incredibly high, overcoming that hurdle opens up a brand new world, where the skill ceiling is virtually non-existent. And all the things that used to make you not enjoy the game — the constant gamification of every single skill set, the quick decisions, the innumerable strategies required for different matchups — become things to get excited about. Seriously, while I joked about actions per second being a real competitive mechanic earlier, isn’t it also kind of interesting to play a game in which every single element of it can be honed and developed to perfection, including how fast and where you click?
The result ends up being a sort of esports Wild West, where the laws and constraints that are in place in other games to ensure an even playing field are non-existent, and you’ll go as far as your skills can take you. Of course, this means you’ll spend countless hours hunched over your computer trying to maximize things like finding and acquiring sheep faster. But unlike other games, where those hours are usually dedicated to acquiring some item that will only marginally increase your attack power, the skills you acquire after these long sessions are yours to keep forever and will make every single game you play more enjoyable. 
None of this is to say that these games are for everyone. I still believe in all of the things that I preach in the other columns. After all, gaming should be for everyone, from the most incredible pro gamer to the run-of-the-mill customer who plays an average of three hours a week. But RTS games, regardless of their difficulty, prove there is value in taking the alternative path for those who want the challenge. If this inspired you to try them out, let me know and I’ll play a couple of matches with you. You’ll get demolished, but at the very least, you’ll know whose face you want to punch.

Following a dominant performance at Manhattan Beach last weekend, No. 2 USC beach volleyball will look to take out Pac-12 opponents as they head up to Stanford to compete in the Pac-12 North Invitational.
The Trojans are coming off a weekend where they swept their opponents, going 4-0 against ranked teams in the East Meets West Invitational. The Trojans kicked off the first day of the tournament with a 4-1 victory over No. 5 LSU, followed by a 3-2 win over No. 3 Florida State. The Trojans dropped only one point on day two, defeating No. 11 Georgia State 4-1 and completing a 5-0 sweep of Florida International.
“​​It was a huge test, and I think the girls played so well,” said Head Coach Dain Blanton. “It’s not as much about the wins as getting better every time we step on the court, because it’s a very fast season and I think everybody really focused in and made that slight improvement every time and executed. We’ve been really winning as a team.”
Now, the Trojans will look to continue this hot streak as they head up North, where they will face Arizona State, Oregon, Arizona and Utah, all for the first time this season. All four teams are unranked.
“We’re really excited, I think the Pac-12 is getting even stronger this year,” said junior Megan Kraft. Kraft is 13-1 this season on court one. “Last year we’d have maybe a match that you thought you would win for sure, but this year it’s go time, you need to go at every match.”
At 17-1, the Trojans boast the best overall record in the Pac-12 based on winning percentage at .944. The Trojans are undefeated this season against Pac-12 teams. USC hosted the Pac-12 South Invitational at the beginning of March, where they defeated then No. 12 UC Berkeley, then No. 7 Stanford, then No. 16 Washington and then No. 1 UCLA. The Trojans also defeated Stanford a second time during the Battle for Los Angeles tournament on March 12.
As the Trojans enter the tail end of the season, their schedule will only grow more intense. Following the Pac-12 North Invitational, USC will play seven matches over seven days. It begins with the Center of Effort Challenge in San Luis Obispo on April 14, followed by a senior day match against CSU Bakersfield on April 18 and a double-header against UCLA and Loyola Marymount on April 20.
“[We’re] just treating every match the same, nothing is bigger or more important than other ones, ​​and obviously taking care of every point once you’re in the game,” Kraft said. “Every team is different, but nothing changes with our training. Just keep pushing and don’t let up.”
With the Pac-12 championships less than a month away, the Trojans will only have one more opportunity to test themselves against a Pac-12 rival when they face No. 4 UCLA at Mapes Beach. They will also have very limited practice time to iron out any issues that remain in their play.
“We want to be executing more when we get the opportunities,” Blanton said. “As you play better teams you might get one or two opportunities, whereas if you don’t capitalize when you get that free ball coming over then it’s gonna cost you.”
USC will kick off the Pac-12 North Invitational April 7 against Arizona State. The match will start at noon at the Sand Hill Courts in Stanford.

USC baseball Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz sits in his office, which overlooks Dedeaux Field, and begins to chuckle. Scouting reports neatly lay neatly across his desk as he prepares for a trio of weekend games. 
But it’s not the pages of statistics Stankiewicz is laughing at. He’s laughing because he can’t really say what his life is like outside of baseball, other than losing to his brother in the occasional round of golf.
“I’m not sure I got too many hobbies outside of this. Probably not a good thing,” Stankiewicz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “My life is centered around these young men and this baseball program. And being as good as we can be as quickly as we possibly can be … My hobby is USC baseball.”
Not only is his life centered around baseball, but the rest of the Stankiewicz family is tied to the sport. His eldest son, Drew, is trying to make it to the major leagues. He just signed with a baseball team in Mexico after toiling in the minor leagues for eight seasons. One of his daughters, Marisa, played college softball at Arizona State and his other daughter, Mia, currently plays at California State University, Northridge. His younger son, Dane, is a volunteer assistant coach at UC San Diego. Father will meet son on April 25 when the Trojans take on UCSD as part of USC’s non-conference schedule.
“That’ll be a fun one,” Stankiewicz said. “We’ll be able to toe it up against each other here this year.”
Stankiewicz has brought the love for baseball he shares with his kids to USC.
Stankiewicz has focused intensely on baseball for many years, coaching at Grand Canyon University for 11 years and playing for seven years in the major leagues. During his time at GCU, he won four Western Athletic Conference Coach of the Year awards — one of only two coaches ever to win four or more in the award’s history. 
He left the program at an all-time high, leading them to their first NCAA Division I postseason appearance in 2021 and their first at-large bid in the following postseason. But Stankiewicz is now the head coach of a historic USC program that has won 12 national championships, the most of any NCAA program.
“To me, [USC] is one of, if not the, historically, most prestigious collegiate baseball programs in the country,” Stankiewicz said. “And I grew up here in Southern Cal, not too far from campus here. And so I’ve just always believed in the school and believed in this baseball program.”
But USC has not had that prestige as of late, sporting losing records in each of the last five full seasons. Enter Stankiewicz.
“[I] certainly knew we got some big challenges in front of us,” Stankiewicz said. “But I just wanted to be a part of helping USC baseball get back to where I think and I believe we need to be.”
When he took over a team that most recently finished dead last in the Pac-12, Stankiewicz knew he would need to bring in the right pieces to make this season a success. One of those pieces came in the form of Trojan legend Seth Etherton, a player on the last USC championship squad in 1998 and now the pitching coach.
“During the interview process, that’s what Coach Stankiewicz talked about, was being able to develop these young men and rebuild this program to what we all know it is in terms of legacy and traditions,” Etherton said. “And it was coming back home … Everything just lined up really well.”
Stankiewicz had the buy-in from a former national champion because Etherton saw the newly crowned head coach’s dedication to this job.
“He cares tremendously about the success of this program,” Etherton said. “The ability for him to come back home, number one, and to run a program like USC: I don’t see another candidate that could do that like Andy Stankiewicz.”
But caring and dedication alone from a coach does not win a championship. Stankiewicz had to convince his players that he could develop them into title contenders.
One piece of advice Stankiewicz often tells his players is to envision where they want to go and where they want to be. He often tells his players a story about his times in the minor leagues when he was in the New York Yankees organization.
“He could be on a back field in spring training and he would visualize that he was taking ground balls in Yankee Stadium,” said senior catcher Connor Clift. “You can kind of play those sounds in your head so that when he did get to Yankee Stadium — and he was playing for the Yankees and he did across seven years, eight years — that when he got there, he was like, I’ve done it for six years.”
Clift added that Stankiewicz’s proficiency at the little things, like envisioning his success and preparing for the bright lights, is a large reason why he has had such a successful baseball career.
Preparing his players for the major leagues is only one of Stankiewicz’s goals at USC. He also wants to get USC back to championships, back to Charles Schwab Field in Omaha.
Though at home at Dedeaux, USC has a history at Schwab.
“If you look at our outfield wall, there’s only one thing out there,” Clift said. “You go to a lot of schools, it says ‘Regional Appearances: 17,’ ‘Super Regional Appearances: four,’ ‘College World Series Appearances: one.’ There’s only national championships on our outfield wall. That’s it.”
Coach Stankiewicz only has to swivel the chair in his office to see that outfield wall which lists the 21 Trojan CWS appearances and 12 national championships.
“I know that’s his expectation, that’s his standard and I know that’s what is asked of him by the University,” Clift said.
Stankiewicz is not one to shy away from those standards just because it is his first year at USC. His teams at GCU had a history of tough non-conference opponents, including playing and beating No. 4 Texas Tech, No. 7 Stanford and No. 5 Oregon State in his last season with the Lopes.
That tradition of playing tough non-conference teams continued early into his USC tenure, as his Trojans played No. 17 Auburn earlier this season.
“That’s who we’re going to play in the postseason,” Stankiewicz said. “And that was the philosophy there and it’ll continue to be the philosophy here. We’re going to get better quicker. And even if it means taking some lumps early … The more that we can push ourselves and challenge ourselves out of conference, I think it’s going to make us more prepared for the stretch at the end.”
Stankiewicz knows it will take time to get the Trojans to Omaha and the College World Series, but is prepared to put in that work.
“It’s going to take commitment and discipline to each other,” Stankiewicz said. “It’s going to take consistent play, consistent coaching every day. Showing up, going to work, put your hard hat on and work, and work, and work and believe in ourselves. And if we do that on a consistent basis and we grow and we get better, I will feel like it was a successful season.”
Stankiewicz was able to envision himself taking ground balls in Yankee Stadium, and he made it to Yankee Stadium. Baseball became his life. Now, he will try and envision his team hoisting a national championship trophy in Omaha and work to make it come true.
