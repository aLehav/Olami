Steve Carell might be best known for starring in strictly comedic roles in The Office and The 40 Year Old Virgin, but Carell shows that he can tackle deeper characters while maintaining his dry wit alongside Keira Knightley in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World.
Carell and Knightley show off a surprising amount of on-screen chemistry in Lorene Scafaria’s feature directorial debut, giving the film a rare, emotionally satisfying combination of comedy and drama a la 2009’s 500 Days of Summer.
Scafaria, who wrote Nick and Nora’s Infinite Playlist, does not focus on a group of people attempting to save the planet, or on the scientific aspect of the apocalypse at all, as most end-of-the-world films do.
It’s clear from the start that Seeking a Friend is about average people and how they would react if they knew that the end was coming. The choice to focus on that aspect of the day of reckoning brings a fresh take to a plot point that has been muddled down by the recent craze of Armageddon-type movies like 2012 that have disappointed with a lack of depth.
Carell plays Dodge, an introverted insurance salesman whose wife leaves him after it is announced that a last ditch attempt to prevent a giant asteroid from crashing into Earth has failed, leaving all humans with only 21 days left to live.
As Dodge’s friends devolve into a state of chaos, throwing raucous parties as they experiment with heroin and feed their toddlers alcohol, he mainly broods around and thinks about better times, which seems to be Carell’s go-to move for his dramatic roles.
Outside of some dark apocalyptic humor — a suicidal jumper lands on Dodge’s windshield — this portion of the plot drags, as it seems Dodge will end up alone for the last three weeks of Earth’s existence.
But one night, not long after a failed suicide attempt, Dodge meets Penny (Knightley), a free spirit who’s proceeded through life with a fraction of the caution that Dodge has.
Knightley portrays Penny, the quintessential modern hippie, quite well. She brings a Zooey Deschanel-esque innocent cuteness to the role, which she was never able to show in the three Pirates of the Caribbean flicks she starred in.
When a riot threatens the safety of the pair’s apartment building, Dodge breaks out of his funk and decides to embark on an adventure to find his old high school sweetheart Olivia, who had attempted a month earlier to re-connect with him through a letter. Penny, who wants to be with her family in England, impulsively decides to join him, and the duo set off.
That’s when the plot — and the laughs — really pick up.
The pair encounter a diner where all the waiters and patrons are rolling on ecstasy (Gillian Jacobs and T.J. Miller steal the scene), a man who believes they are the assassins he hired to kill himself and Dodge’s long-detached father, who we find played a big part in shaping Dodge into the guarded man he became.
Many comedy drama films fail to establish an emotional connection between its protagonists and its audience, causing the more dramatic moments to suffer. But Carell and Knightley ably reject this stereotype, drawing the audience into becoming emotionally invested in the characters’ journey. As the characters get closer to reaching their destination, you find yourself desperately hoping that Dodge and Penny somehow avoid the inevitable end of the world.
There are a couple points where the  100-minute film drags — namely in a largely unnecessary scene where Dodge and Penny are jailed for going 15 miles per hour over the speed limit.
Another small irritation comes from Owen (Adam Brody), Penny’s boyfriend, who is solely in the film to provide comic relief in a riot scene that would have been better without it.
But all in all, Seeking A Friend provides a delightful movie going experience, brilliantly integrating the comedic and dramatic aspects of the script.
Though the film does slow to a bit of crawl near the middle, it’s an engrossing, charming ride, even as the characters’ outlooks become gradually more depressing.
Admittedly, the plot does somewhat begin to fall into mushy romantic comedy clichés, but several plot twists near the film’s conclusion keeps the audience guessing until the end.

Calling all geeks! The moment you have all been waiting for is just around the corner. San Diego Comic-Con 2012 begins July 15. And now, just in time for this year’s convention, Geeks! The Musical returns to the Write Act Repertory Theatre in Hollywood.
1 + 1 = love · Jonathan Brett plays a fanboy attending a convention in quest of a Batman comic and the girl (Redetha Deason) of his dreams. - Photo courtesy of Write Act Repertory
Award-winning playwright Tom Misuraca, a self-proclaimed comic book collector, Doctor Who fanatic and Star Wars geek, produced the musical’s book and lyrics; while Bennett Cohon directs.
Centered around the San-Diego Comic Book/Sci-Fi Convention, the story follows a group of — you guessed it — geeks as they journey through various dilemmas in fandom. Geek boy Jordan (Jonathan Brett) strives to get the girl (Redetha Deason) — and a mint copy of Batman #92.
If Jordan gets the girl, will the Mario to his Luigi, Chip (Tyler Koster), be abandoned? Or worse, will Chip get stuck spending his entire time at Comic-Con with elitist Emerson (Wil Bowers / Stefan Rich)?
Meanwhile, Trey (Brandon Murphy Barnes), the sexually confused artist, and his Goth friend, Audrina (Juliette Angeli), are hell-bent on getting their avant-garde comic book published.
And in an age of ignorance toward classics, has-been sci-fi actor Mel Tyler (Dan Woren) endures criticism and badgering from fans as they inquire about the upcoming remake of his old TV show.
With the Write Act Repertory Theatre inside a church, you might expect a rather pristine production. But looks can be deceiving, the musical proved to be rather raunchy.
It was a pleasant surprise to hear Misuraca’s colorful language come to life. From sexual innuendos involving Doctor Who’s sonic screwdriver to jokes about Princess Leia’s breasts, it would be advised to leave the younger geeks at home.
All music is played live on a keyboard by the talented Rocco Vitacco; he even has a few humorous one-liners. Misuraca’s lyrics are also full of catchy word play that’s entertaining for the hardcore geek as well as educational for the newbie.
In particular, “The Who’s Who of Doctor Who” provides a fun way to remember the names of all 11 actors who have played “The Doctor” in BBC’s hit TV series, Doctor Who.
The realness of the characters being portrayed can provide a comforting feeling for any geek. The characters in Geeks! The Musical ask the audience to look beyond the stereotype of taped-up glasses and suspenders and to understand that geeks are people with individual differences.
They are gay, straight, black, white and even girls. And they don’t all share the same geeky interests, as the song “There’s Gotta Be Some Middle Ground Here” explains.
Geeks! The Musical is a must-see for any fan of comic books and science fiction and especially all attendees of San Diego Comic-Con.
Grab your light saber and sonic screwdriver, throw on your tights and cape and get your batmobile to the Write Act Repertory Theatre.
 
Geeks! The Musical plays at the Write Act Repertory Theatre until July 8.

In the band’s new self-titled album debut, Morning Parade uses what fans have heard before from other artists — the sentimental verses, the catchy-yet-passionate choruses, the builds — to execute its own songs in a uniquely refreshing yet familiar way.
All in the gang · British band Morning Parade releases an interesting album filled with different styles of songs, ranging from moody to edgy to compelling. Morning Parade showcases a hint of promise for the band’s future.years. - Photo courtesy of Sandra Kuker
“Blue Winter” opens the album with a tempo and beat reminiscent of Radiohead’s slinky, grooving “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi.” It’s edgy, but there’s also a dazzling and inexplicable mysticism to the song that sets the bar high for the rest of the album. But in this way, “Blue Winter” isn’t the ideal choice for an opening track. Though there’s no doubt the song is compelling, depending on who’s listening, “Blue Winter” acts not only as a tour de force that compels listeners to continue listening but also as a one-trick track that convinces listeners that once they have heard one title from the album, they have heard it all.
The second track, however, dismisses any doubts that “Blue Winter” might have created. An upbeat tribute to the universally acknowledged theme of love, “Headlights” uses the band’s signature hushed, sultry quality — with credit going to vocalist Steve Sparrow and drummer Andy Hayes — to pull at the heartstrings of listeners. “I am all too predictable” is one line that Sparrow sings with such melancholic resignation that it continues to echo long after the song has ended.
“Carousel” stands out with the contrasts it makes between sweeter vocals in the verses and a more powerful and emotionally driven chorus. The chilling lyric “A melody of our own” is sung in a smooth falsetto that adds a touch of musical vulnerability, making “Carousel” one of the more memorable tracks on the album.
But it is with “Running Down the Aisle” that Morning Parade’s album starts to show some weakness. Like many of the songs on the album, “Running Down the Aisle” has depth, especially from the somber notes from the piano and vocals in the foreground. But the lyrics, “Tell them to keep the cameras rolling / To keep the champagne flowing / Going nowhere, going nowhere / Tell them to keep their bed of roses” sound overwhelmingly melodramatic. At least the disjointed frenzy of static, guitars and drums makes for a very edgy breakdown; the bridge also creates an intense build and helps to save this song from slogging down in its subject matter.
The album gets back on track by following “Running Down the Aisle” with two already acclaimed titles, “Us and Ourselves” and “Under the Stars.”
With deep harmonies, “Us and Ourselves” showcases the musical ingenuity of Morning Parade, which comes through as a combination between the musicality of Coldplay and the uncapped intensity of a rock band.
Morning  Parade mashes together planetarium and nightclub to create “Under the Stars,” a cosmic kind of melody that makes use of techno beats, crashing cymbals and intermingling voices. It is anthemic but also offers a deeper and more soulful level of musical subtlety.
“Close to Your Heart” is neither one of Morning Parade’s best songs nor one of its worst. It’s a safe track, one that blends seamlessly among the others in the album. Though “Close to Your Heart” embodies the edginess and sentimentality that Morning Parade infuses into most of its songs, the beat, the timing and the harmonies feel predictable and far from original.
Taking a break from the guitar shredding and gruff vocals, “Half Litre Bottle” is a soft and lulling song, with the melodic strums of the guitar accompanying Sparrow, who shows off a sweeter side of his extremely versatile voice. It is poetic, with the dynamic repetition of “Where were the angels that night” carrying through until the end, and promotes a genuine quality synonymous with Oasis’ timeless song “Wonderwall.”
But having exhausted its best material, the album begins to fall flat — with a few exceptions.
“Monday Morning” is a mix between the gloom of “Half Litre Bottle” and the musical and lyrical depth of “Blue Winter.” “Monday Morning” sounds like a song that would play while a person stands miserably in the rain, shivering and alone — full of anguished sorrow. Like “Close to Your Heart,” however, “Monday Morning” runs very predictably, without much ebb and flow to keep the listener fully engaged.
A simple and peaceful track from Morning Parade, “Speechless” is unlike any other song on the album. “Speechless,” which swaps a drum set for a tambourine, perhaps stands as Morning Parade’s hopeful attempt at an indie song. Though pleasant and meaningful, it comes across as a track that falls more along the vanilla lines of The Fray rather than, say, Fleet Foxes.
Concluding the album, “Born Alone” tries to bring the album back full circle by reprising elements used throughout Morning Parade. The lyrics are more intricate, the drums make a return and there is a sense of rejoicing in this final track. Though not particularly memorable, “Born Alone” does end the album on a vigorous note.
With its songs already nearing new heights of popularity, Morning Parade’s new album acts as a launch pad for many more musical successes to come. The band’s ability to go from a lively anthem to something sweet and mellow, all while staying true to its style and music, is a trait that can leave the band’s fans “Speechless.”

Woody Allen fell for Barcelona and Paris in his previous destination-based films Vicky Christina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris. The notable director and screenwriter’s latest European romp To Rome With Love is no exception, serving as a cinematic love letter to the city of ancient ruins, rich culture and eccentric personalities.
Lost in Translation · Academy Award-winning actor Roberto Benigni stars as Leopaldo Pisanello, an ordinary Roman who becomes the toast of town overnight, followed by paparazzi and hit on by beautiful movie stars. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
As with many of Allen’s works — particularly last year’s monster success Midnight in Paris — the stunning cinematography is the true highlight of the film. The romantic lighting and vivid colors paint an authentic portrait of life in Italy, as if Allen is manipulating his detailed camera work to convey his love affair with Rome.
And this love for Rome appears fitting, as much of the film centers on themes of passion, romance and relationships. When it comes down to it, the film tells a tale of desire, be that the desire for sex, fame or simply another life: Every character wants something more.
Though an interesting concept, the overall theme is too vague, even despite the fact that the film takes the time to examine the varying shapes desire takes. Accordingly, the film doesn’t know what story it wants to tell and lacks the focus necessary to tell a cohesive, meaningful narrative.
Specifically, the film follows four storylines: an engaged couple whose parents are meeting for the first time, an average business and family man who becomes famous for no apparent reason, a married couple with a dysfunctional sexual relationship and a young couple that struggles to stay together when a seductive friend comes to town.
These characters are connected by their appetite for more, and that’s about it. The film simply showcases their experiences in Rome, but these experiences don’t amount to anything. It’s as if Allen took a backseat and just let the characters mosey through the film with no real direction or purpose.
Granted, some films focus just on its characters and don’t need some awe-inspiring, greater meanings. Here, however, there’s simply no motivating force to keep the viewer interested.
These narrative flaws feel all the more frustrating considering the film’s all-star cast, which brims with potential. Funnyman Alec Baldwin takes hilarious digs at indie darling Ellen Page as she charms her way into the heart of her best friend’s boyfriend, played by Jesse Eisenberg. Penélope Cruz shines as a witty, endearing hooker who makes cracks about her trade. Then there’s Allen himself, who at long last makes his return to acting with his signature snarky attitude in tow; in this case, however, his character feels tired rather than one worth welcoming with open arms.
These characters have the potential to become full and rich, but in the end serve little purpose as their importance to the narrative is unclear, making them seem trivial.
On the upside, the cast’s talents and Allen’s quirky screenwriting create for a few memorable comedic moments.  The painfully ordinary Leopaldo (Roberto Benigni) becomes famous out of the blue, allowing a series of mundane questions from the press about his eating and grooming habits to follow suit to great comic effect. Then there’s Jerry’s (Allen) soon-to-be in-law, Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato), whom Jerry convinces to sing opera onstage for a crowd, though Giancarlo can only muster such courage in a shower.
Small moments like these allow the audience to see that the veteran filmmaker is still kicking with eccentric charm, but this subtle humor fails to shine throughout the rest of the film, serving as yet another instance of To Rome With Love’s rich potential but failure to follow through.
This is truly aggravating, as Allen has all the right ingredients: A knack for screenwriting, an impressive cast, spellbinding cinematography and a beautiful location to shoot.  Consequently, To Rome With Love looks great on a superficial level, but the film ultimately feels like a jumbled mess that lacks direction and the developed characters of Vicky Christina Barcelona or the focused narrative of Midnight in Paris.
Despite all its potential, by the end the film it’s clear: Allen seems to be only one in the movie truly taken by Rome and all that it has to offer.

The School of Pharmacy received more than $12 million from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to improve safe use of prescription drugs by bringing pharmacists into Southern California safety-net clinics. The award is the largest that the school has ever received, according to a press release from the school.
Over the counter · School of Pharmacy’s grant will go toward a project to improve medication adherence and the safe use of prescriptios drugs. - Ani Kolangian| Summer Trojan
The school plans to partner with AltaMed, which works to close health disparities in Southern California, to launch the project in three Orange Country treatment clinics serving communities with large uninsured populations and poor access to medical services. The project will ultimately include AltaMed clinics in Los Angeles County.
“The project is designed to address both the widespread misuse of prescribed medications and the shortage of primary care providers in low-income populations,” said Geoffrey Joyce, the project’s principal investigator and an associate professor at the School of Pharmacy, in a statement. “Further, pharmacists are remarkably underutilized in the U.S. health care system and this demonstration will test and evaluate the impact of using them in primary care settings.”
According to the school’s statement, poor compliance with prescription drugs results in avoidable negative health effects that total $290 billion in annual national medical spending. Some of these effects include hospitalizations and a higher risk of death.
“This is a tremendous opportunity for us to again demonstrate and evaluate a model of care that uses pharmacists to cost-effectively improve health outcomes,” said R. Pete Vanderveen, dean of the School of Pharmacy, in a statement. “Our faculty has over a decade of experience in the safety net [and]… this important project that promises to provide desperately needed medication management services to some of the most vulnerable in our community.”

Under a new immigration policy announced by President Barack Obama on Friday, undocumented students who came to the United States before the age of 16 and have clean criminal records may seek employment without the threat of deportation.
The policy states that the Department of Homeland Security will discontinue the deportation of younger illegal immigrants and allow them to apply for work permits if they meet certain requirements. In addition to the age and record requirements, eligible immigrants must have lived in the United States for at least five  consecutive years, be in school and be high school graduates or military veterans.
Veronica Terriquez, director of USC’s Chicano and Latino studies program, said the policy may open up new job opportunities for undocumented students with college degrees.
“It appears that undocumented students will be able to access work permits, which may allow them to attain a job commensurate with their educational credentials,” Terriquez said. “This is good news because there are young people who are educated by our public and private school systems, who have college educations and are working at restaurants or are working in the types of jobs that don’t require much education so it’s a waste of talent.”
Gene Bickers, vice provost for undergraduate programs, said the university enrolls both undocumented undergraduate and graduate students.
“There is no specific office that works with them,” Bickers said. “They are regarded the same as any other students in the university.”
Terriquez said USC’s undocumented population is small and that the highest proportion of undocumented students enroll in public community colleges.
Nef Cardenas, a junior at Cerritos College, is researching photochemical reactions as a summer intern at USC. Cardenas said the new policy is “perfect” because students who have graduated with degrees can pursue jobs related to their studies.
“I know people that have master’s [degrees], graduate students, and all they do is wait tables, bag groceries … stuff that pays minimum or below minimum wage,” Cardenas said.
Michelle Tomkovicz, a senior majoring in international relations, said though she is not personally affected by the policy, many of her friends welcomed the change.
“I have a lot of friends back home who said they know some of their friends and families are really happy about it,” Tomkovicz said.
Though Terriquez also said the policy is more economically efficient, she underscored the fact that this fix does not provide a long-term solution for illegal immigration.
“This is positive for the short term, but for the long term there has to be a pathway to citizenship so people can become fully incorporated [into] U.S. society,” Terriquez said.
The policy does not include a pathway to citzenship, as legislation rejected by the Senate in late 2010, known as the DREAM Act, would  have.
The naysayers seem to have conveniently forgotten that the President took the Dream Act to Congress several times and that it was shot down by a 40% minority in the Senate.
The 40% minority (this time Republicans) can block any legislation.
In essence a double veto exists for any legislation, a 40% minority in the Senate and that of the President as well.
The Senate veto is the threat of the Filibuster, an archaic invention of the 19th Century established about the expansion of Slavery.
The Senate veto needs to  be eliminated.
As a supporter of the DREAM act, I thought this article was acceptable. I am disappointed by these conservative comments that call undocumented immigrants “illegals.”
These articles in support of the Dream Act, and the President’s latest immigration policy, are so annoying and often factually inaccurate.  This particular article suggests that illegal immigrants with high-level degrees are forced to work at low paying jobs, or jobs requiring little education, because of their illegal status.  This makes no sense.   Their illegal status means that they are not supposed to be working anywhere in this country at all… regardless of whether it is a skilled and highly paid job, or a low-wage, low-skill job.  If in fact, college graduates are working at all (grocery stores, car washes, etc)… then they are clearly working illegally, whether the job is commensurate with their education or not. 
Why do colleges and universities in this country even allow so-called “undocumented” people to apply?  Doing so does not comport with any of the laws of our country, and only sets these young people up for failure and disappointment.  All foreign students should hold a valid student visa to attend schools in this country.  Don’t we already have such a system in place?.. or is that system only intended for people who abide by the law?
It seems to me that many people’s idea of “immigration reform” means creation of a new set of rules whereby someone who has managed to evade the law for long enough, including four or more years of a college education while “undocumented”, should now be allowed to apply for work without the requisite W-4’s and I-9s that legal citizens are required to complete.  I earned my bachelors at USC as a legal immigrant, and as such, I was required to check special boxes on the application and provide my alien registration number and copies of related documents.  It infuriates me that I was forced to follow a set of clearly and fairly established rules in order to live, work and get an education in this country… only to see a current generation of greedy, ungrateful and misinformed people plea for a new and separate set of rules.
Perhaps the next time I apply for a job, I should just tell HR that I refuse to fill out an I-9… and see what they say.
The addition of what some say is more than 800,000 illegals who meet the new requirements will be on the job market and will be taking your jobs.  In a time of our country’s most dire days, where unemployment for our citizens is at an all time high, Obama just micturated on the US Constitution again with the stroke of a pen.  Jobs are scarce already, so why is he allowing more people to be free to take what available jobs there are?  College students from the last 2 years are still looking for their 2st job, and you kids are soon going to be out there after graduation looking for non-existent work.  You can thank your president for taking away your ability to earn a living, because he just added upwards of 2million people into the workforce over the next few years.
Oh yes, now I remember why Obama did this.  It’s an election year and he cannot run on his leadership abilities and his strong program of economic growth and job creation, so he issues a pandering effort to gain some votes from the Latino community.
Let’s see now, Pandering to the LGBT movement, the Mexican illegal movement… gosh what’s next?  Ya know what?  If it’s now OK for gays and lesbians to marry, then I’d like to have 2 legal wives.  :-)   Yeah, right!
During the past few decades our Presidents and Congress had little interest in stopping illegal immigration and did little to enforce our immigration laws. The Government was apparently content about our porous borders, letting in good and bad illegal immigrants. That Government tacit acceptance of the illegal immigrants does not make the immigrants legal, but it did establish a Government  obligation. 
Obligation? Yes. Having accepted the unlawful entry of 12 million illegals and having tolerated them in the US for decades, the Federal Government now owes them. It must come up with a humane, decent and practical solution for absorbing them. Supposing that we can deport millions of these tacitly accepted illegals is not realistic. Finding a way to absorb them as legal Americans is necessary. And yes, of course screen out the violent and other genuine criminals among them, try them, imprison them and deport them.
President Obama has taken a good first step to resolve the problem. Hopefully, he will lead Congress to continue the process and find a way to absorb the decent illegals and expel the criminals.  As for future illegal immigrants, one rule of international relations is especially pertinent.  It applies to any country, any nation:  A nation has the right to control its own borders, establish laws, and enforce its immigration policy. The degree of accepting legal immigrants is up to the nation.  Who else should decide who comes in? Some other nation? Lawbreakers? No. A nation, our nation, has the right to control its own borders.
Does that mean we should cut immigration, then? No, not if we need more desirable working people who want to be good Americans. Certainly, we need scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs and ordinary, patriotic, hard working people. Exclude Hispanics then? Of course not.  They are as deserving of legal immigation here as any other ethnic group. A quota system, or first come first served, or other policy is up to the President and Congress.
The final point is of course to protect our borders and our country. Not seal the borders, but protect them to the degree that it is extremely difficult for an illegal to enter the US. When we catch them, they should go to prison before being deported. And we need internal laws so that future illegals can be identified and deported.
Maybe our President has finally started the process of solving the problem. I hope so.

The Expo line will officially extend to Culver City at noon Wednesday, renewing concerns about how the new rail line will affect safety at USC, especially in the fall.
One of the major concerns for the Department of Public Safety is how the rail line will operate during USC football games, DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.
Safety first · University officials tour the Expo line April 16 before it opens. The Department of Public Safety said it is concerned about the safety effects of the new line, including fans crossing the street during home football games. - Photo courtesy of USC
“Our first concern has been for the safety of the pedestrians walking in the area of the train, particularly during home football games when thousands of fans cross Exposition Boulevard en route to and from the Coliseum,” Carlisle said. “The [Metro Transportation Authority] videotaped the game day crossing at Trousdale and Expo last year and they will have a plan in place for the safe crossing of the tracks on game days.”
Carlisle also said that with the added convenience of cheap public transportation in the area, there could potentially be increased foot traffic and criminal activity at USC’s campus.
“The new rail line will provide reasonably priced transportation to campus and the Exposition Park neighborhood from as far away as Culver City,” Carlisle said. “While most of the people coming to campus are law-abiding people, some may take the train to campus for less than honorable purposes, but that is no different than those who take other forms of public transportation such as the bus.”
Madeline Aubuchon, a sophomore majoring in computer science and business administration, said one of the major issues she foresees is the line creating a major concern for public safety when the campus is extremely busy, including on football game days.
“On game days, everyone knows students and alumni get really spirited during the walk over to the Coliseum,” Aubuchon said. “It would be really awful if someone made the poor decision to go near the metro line’s tracks and ended up getting injured.”
Despite safety concerns, many students are enthusiastic about the extension of the line because it will broaden the number of places where students can visit and work.
Katherine Lin, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said most USC students will not be affected by the new rail line, but the new addition could provide benefits for students who work in the Culver City area.
“One of the only impacts I see the new rail line having would be that it would allow students with internships near Culver City to easily travel to that area,” Lin said. “Ultimately, I don’t see USC being affected by any additional criminal activity because of the line, and I think many USC students won’t see any impact at all until the Metro line expands all the way to the beach.”
Expo line rides will be free for riders originating at the Culver City and Farmdale stations on Wednesday.
Anyone with a bike might like to know that the Expo line allows bikes and if you ride to La Cienega,  you can get on the Ballona Creek Bike Path and ride an easy 7 miles to the beach.

The DREAM generation
President Barack Obama bypassed Congress and implemented a new immigration policy Friday that will halt deportation of young illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as children.
Individuals under the age of 30 who arrived to the U.S. before the age of 16 would be eligible for such immunity, granted that they fall within certain eligibility requirements, which mirror the requirements of The DREAM Act.
Many believe that by bypassing Congress, the president has shown disregard for the way our government works and that the president is looking to grant automatic amnesty to illegal immigrants.
I believe, however, that our president is giving a generation of children the right to live their dreams — the foundation that America is built on.
The 1.5 generation. A silent generation, a hidden generation, the generation that speaks English fluently and embraces every aspect of the culture, saluting the flag, celebrating the 4th of July, playing with other American children and identifying themselves as American.
Sadly, it isn’t until between the ages of 16 to 18 — when they want to learn to drive or graduate high school — that these children ultimately learn the truth: That their dreams are no longer achievable because of their illegal status.
The 1.5 generation is one that was brought to the U.S. illegally at a very young age with no choice in the decision.
Yet in our nation they are punished for something they did not ask for.
Though many might see the policy only as a short-term remedy for illegal immigration, it is a start that will provide the 1.5 generation the opportunity to follow a strict, structured pathway toward legal status, all while bettering American society.
Children will have the opportunity to attend higher education or to serve our country by joining the military, in turn improving our country as a whole; it’s better than dropping out of school or finding opportunities in criminal activity.
As a nation, we are quick to stand up and defend the children who face struggles in their everyday lives. Are we going to stand up and fight for these children the way we do for other oppressed children across the nation and world, or are we going to turn the other cheek and let these children fall behind like so many others have?
It’s time for these children to believe and follow their hopes and dreams, in the only way they know how, in the only place they truly know as home: America.

Well-written, concise, opinion. All in America deserve dignity and the right to pursue their dreams.
The author’s viewpoint is sincere, but regrettably misguided and inaccurate.  To begin with, has anyone ever asked how the government will confirm exactly when these young people entered the country illegally?  Doesn’t the very nature of “illegal” immigration suggest that no official record of their entrance was ever recorded?  I also firmly disagree with the premise behind this new policy, and the Dream Act itself.  What is the relevance of their illegal status being “no fault of their own”?  For example, if my father were to steal a bicycle for me for my 10th birthday… do the authorities not have a right to confiscate it as stolen property?  Does anyone think the authorities have no right to take it from me because I didn’t actually steal it myself?  And if I cry and moan at the loss of my bike, would that not be the fault of my father, not the authorities?
The author also suggests that this is not a “short-term remedy” but rather a “start that will provide…opportunity”.  This is simply not true.  In fact, because this new policy is not codified in law through congress, and provides only for a renewable 2 year permit, it is not only short-term, but it also leaves many of these young people in a very untenable and unstable situation.  The fact is that they remain here illegally, and are still not citizens.
Finally, the author summarily describes these young people as a “silent and hidden generation”… that “speaks English fluently and embraces every aspect of the culture, saluting the flag, celebrating the 4th of July, playing with other American children…”   Really?  Do we know this to be true of all the eligible illegals under the President’s new policy?  I haven’t read anywhere that these were among the qualifications required under this policy.  If someone under this policy doesn’t speak English fluently, will they be denied a temporary work permit?  Are they required to embrace every aspect of the culture and salute the flag?  And I certainly wouldn’t describe this generation as either “silent” or “hidden” as it seems I’ve been hearing about marches and sit-ins to support the Dream Act for years.
I think the author repeats much of the same rhetoric and faulty theories I always hear discussed on this topic.  It’s a terrible shame.  These policies only serve to undermine the true sacrifices that so many have made in coming to this country legally.  They leave young people and families in a state of confusion and unsustainability.  It rewards bad behaviour and suggests that those who can circumvent the law well enough or long enough, will eventually be granted immunity.  As a first generation immigrant myself, who legally came to this country with my parents at a very young age and has since spent well over $2,000 in fees and charges applying for my US citizenship… My one question for the President would be:  Do I get a refund?

Though political pundit and radio jockey Rush Limbaugh is known for being controversial, his comments made toward Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke probably made even his most ardent supporters cringe.
Christina Ellis | Summer Trojan
When Fluke wanted to speak at a Congressional hearing on contraception, Limbaugh decided to take the opportunity to call the young woman “a slut,” “a prostitute,” and continued to say that “She was not allowed to testify [at the hearing] because it was not about women at Georgetown who have so much sex they can’t afford birth control.”
Even though it probably goes without saying, Limbaugh’s comments were despicable and should make you question the state of his sanity. His words, however, managed to shed a light on a very important issue discussed in the new health care reform law: Birth control.
By the end of this week, a decision will be made on President Barack Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care act, which will affect every American citizen. Under the act, millions of those not yet insured would have the opportunity to join the ranks of the covered.
No longer would hospital visits cost astronomical amounts, and perhaps that lower-middle-class child diagnosed with cancer could finally afford the treatment he or she deserves.
And crucially, the official OK from the Supreme Court would also give millions of women the opportunity to receive their birth control for free.
Some, like Limbaugh, see this part of the bill as detrimental and perverted. Why should we be paying for our young women to be having casual sex? Don’t free contraceptives now give our teenage daughters a reason to get under the sheets?
The answer, of course, is no. Though free birth control seems like the apocalypse to some, to others it’s the promise of calm in an economic storm.
Few women are lucky enough to have their contraceptives covered by their insurance provider. If they aren’t covered — and most aren’t — each monthly pack of birth control can cost a woman around $75. Multiplied by 12, that’s $900 a year.
If Obama’s health care reform act passes with this contraceptive measure intact, these women will get a much-needed break. It’ll give them a little extra money to put food on the table or to save for their college education while offering them the safety and benefits of birth control.
And though some want to sweep the idea of teenage sex under the rug, it’s harmful to ignore the ever-growing presence of sex around young women. Yes, abstinence should continue to be taught as the No. 1 effective way to prevent STDs and pregnancy. But teenage girls need to be taught options besides having a condom on hand when it comes to keeping yourself safe.
It’s easy to get outraged at the thought of young people having promiscuous sex. But focusing on that also ignores the fact that birth control often helps to alleviate menstrual pain, severe acne and even mood swings as a result of hormone deficiencies. The key is to acknowledge that birth control does more than simply allow casual sex.
What women need is a choice, a choice in a world where our voices are often quieter than they should be.
And for those who think that free birth control will corrupt the minds of young Americans: Fear not. Birth control does not cause a sudden craze of hypersexualized women, contrary to what some might assume.
What women really want is the chance to make their own choices about their bodies, without having to pay an arm and a leg.

There are so many flaws with this article that I don’t even know where to begin. Bear with me.
1. You consistently emphasize the idea of “free” health care. It’s about as “free” as public education. Addiitionally you blatantly neglect a cost-benefit analysis….when health care is “free,” the quality is not good. Britain currently has “free” health care. I won’t bore you with the details here, but long story short, he died of cancer that could have been easily prevented had he had the proper care – care that would have been ridiculously easy for him to procure had he been in America.
2. You go on and on abuot the woman’s “choice.” I am a woman. I’m not interested in having sex at this point in my life. I am also not interested in having someone else pay for birth control for me when i do have sex. Where is MY “choice” in whether or not I pay for somebody else’s? The comment about being able to put more food on the table is laughable. OK, so they’ll have more money because it comes out of MY pocket? It seems as though you think that if someone was truly struggling to feed their family, it would be irresponsible of OTHERS not to provide birth control rather than it being irresponsible of the WOMAN to a) budget it better b) use NFP c) this one is a shocker…abstain! *gasp*.
3. There are many other things I would like to point out here, but for the sake of not writing a novel in this comment box there is only one more very important issue I would like to address:
 You constantly bring up all the “positives” of birth control…excuse me, but what about the negatives? As is typical of adamant proponents of birth control, you completely fail to mention the increased potentaility of breast cancer and infertility when on the pill.In addition, the chemicals in some forms of birth control are the SAME bone-degenerative chemicals given to prisoners on death row (however, these are mainly shots). The point is, this is yet another example of an ignorant commentary on how great birth control really is when all of detrimental aspects are, as you would say, “swept under the rug.”
I know this must come across as rather rude. That is not my intent.I merely become excessively frustrated when someone – especially a now-upperclassman at a top-tier school – makes the repetitive and flawed points in a publication that is read by many and essentially represents the school.
And if you read this entire thing, you deserve a gold star.
As a supporter of women’s health and rights, I appreciated this op/ed. I was disappointed by all these comments’ failure to see the author’s positive intentions.
YOU SAY….”What women really want is the chance to make their own choices about their bodies, without having to pay an arm and a leg.” WHAT ABOUT YOUR UNBORN BABIES’ CHOICE?. HE/SHE HAS NONE.  WHAT IF YOUR MOM THOUGHT THE SAME WAY YOU DO NOW? 
ONLY ANIMALS THINK THE WAY YOU DO.
SATISFYING YOUR SEX DRIVE IS ALL THAT MATTERS, RIGHT?
LIVING FOR SELF….No Sacrifices…only ME, ME, ME.
See what that gets you. Both here on earth, & afterwards.
Stupid article. No one should be forced to pay for anyone else’s sex life. Don’t give me that crap about helping alleviate mood swings, cramps, etc….that’s not what the spoiled idiot at Georgetown was griping about. She was very clear she wants the pills for sex. What have we become? There is no shame anymore. NOW we are actually listening to a student at an elite law school who wants free birth control. And this article is in agreement. We have become so weak and reliant. Stupid and lazy is what we are becoming.
There are alternatives to using BC pills and that is the condom, vaginal cremes, douche and others.  Most healthcare plans cover the pills, but it is not a requirement for healthcare plans to cover them.  It is a benefit that the company negotiates when they design the plan that they are going to provide to their employees.
If a company doesn’t feel that BC pill coverage is appropriate, then why does the government think they need to tell us what we can and cannot have in our healthcare plans?  Americans already get government funded abortion coverage, so where do you draw the line as to where your moral convictions interfere with mine?
Limbaugh’s statement was classless, but his point is well taken.  Why should the public , through increased taxes and a potential healthcare mandate be responsible for your birth control requirements.  That’s a personal decision and not one the government should be involved in.
nice! free birth control hopefully means lower birth rate among the lower class who cannot even afford to have a kid, let alone 5!

Second-year USC graduate swimming coach Ous Mellouli, in only his second open-water race, won the men’s 10K at the FINA Olympic marathon swimming qualifier in Setubal, Portugal, last week.
Mellouli won the race in 1:45:18.5, more than 11 seconds ahead of Canada’s Richard Weinberger, who took second in 1:45:30.2.
Mellouli, who swam for the Trojans from 2003 to 2006, was already competing in the 200-meter, 400-meter and 1500-meter freestyle. He was a 2005 NCAA champion in the 400-yard individual medley, a seven-time Pac-10 title winner and a 16-time All-American during his four years.
Mellouli won a gold medal in the 1,500-meter in the 2008 Olympics for his native Tunisia — the country’s first ever swimming Olympic title. He graduated  with a degree in computer engineering and computer science.

For the second consecutive year, USC senior Steve Johnson was named the Campbell/Intercollegiate Tennis Association National College Player of the Year on Friday.
Living legend · Steve Johnson was named Intercollegiate Tennis Association Player of the Year for the second straight year. He helped lead the Trojans to four consecutive national championships. - Corey Marquetti | Summer Trojan
Johnson wrapped up a prolific four-year career at USC with his second straight NCAA singles championship in May.
He also helped the Trojans capture four consecutive NCAA team championships and finished 37-0 in singles in his senior year.
Johnson ended his career ranked No. 1 in ITA rankings for the second straight time and finished with an unprecedented streak of 72 singles wins, which dates to January 2011.
In his senior year, Johnson gave up just two sets to 26 dual match opponents and one set to six opponents in the NCAA singles tournament.
Johnson also finished 21-1 in overall doubles with freshman Roberto Quiroz. The No. 2 ranked pair advanced to the quarterfinals of the NCAA doubles tournament.
Johnson is the fourth men’s player to earn the Campbell/ITA National Player of the Year award in consecutive seasons.
Other accolades include two straight Pac-12 men’s Player of the Year awards and seven ITA All-American honors after earning both singles and doubles honors this season.
USC has produced the last three Campbell/ITA National College Players of the Year, including Johnson in the last two years and Robert Farah in 2010.
Johnson will be recognized alongside female Player of the Year Nicole Gibbs from Stanford at the 2012 International Tennis Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony on July 14 in Newport, R.I.

Though most Trojans have been participating in unofficial team workouts in preparation for fall camp and the upcoming football season, one key member of the 2011 team that went 10-2 and finished sixth in the final AP poll remains notably absent: Junior wide receiver Robert Woods.
Sidelined · Junior wide receiver Robert Woods set a Pac-12 record for catches last season. He and sophomore Marqise Lee each had more than 1,000 yards receiving last year and caught double-digit touchdowns. - Daily Trojan file photo
Woods, who was also unable to take part in spring practice after undergoing arthroscopic ankle surgery in December, told ESPN LA’s Pedro Moura that a recent MRI still showed inflammation in his ankle. On June 8, shortly before the MRI was taken, Woods remarked to ESPN LA that he was hoping to be cleared by team doctors “shortly.”
Despite the setback, Woods hopes to return in time for practice in early August. He played despite the injured ankle for most of last season and has said he will do so again if necessary.
Woods is coming off an All-American 2011 campaign in which he finished with 111 catches, 1,292 yards and 15 touchdowns. He broke former Trojan Keyshawn Johnson’s long-standing single-season receptions record, (setting a new Pac-12 mark in the process), finished as a finalist for the Biletnikoff Award — given to the nation’s best wide receiver — and had at least 100 yards receiving in seven games.
In USC’s opener against Minnesota on Sept. 3, Woods set a single-game school record with 17 receptions, adding 177 yards and three touchdowns in a 19-17 victory. In an Oct. 1 home game against Arizona, Woods finished with 14 catches, 255 yards and two scores as the Trojans beat the Wildcats 48-41.
If Woods isn’t cleared to return to practice in time for fall camp, the Trojans will turn to sophomore Marqise Lee to serve as the team’s top receiving threat. Lee was named the 2011 Pac-12 Freshman Offensive Co-Player of the Year after putting up 1,143 yards and 11 touchdowns on 73 receptions. He was No. 15 in the country in receiving yards and had a career-high 224 yards and two touchdowns in a 50-0 rout over UCLA on Nov. 26.
Other receivers who would take on larger roles include redshirt freshman Victor Blackwell, redshirt junior De’Von Flournoy and sophomore George Farmer, a highly recruited player out of high school who dealt with injury problems in the spring but should be healthy come August. Incoming freshman Nelson Agholor could also see time at wide receiver.
Rest that Ankle Woods! Need you full speed!
