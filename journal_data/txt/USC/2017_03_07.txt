With comments and tweets from President Donald Trump regarding fake news, and claims that “FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn’t tell the truth,” the discussion of the role of the press in the United States has become a contested one.
A panel addressed the role of the media in politics today at the Wallis Annenberg Hall Tuesday night. The event was hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Annenberg Center on Communication Leadership and Policy. 
Jessica Yellin, the former CNN Chief White House Correspondent, moderated a panel made up of five members of the media: Kurtis Lee, a political reporter for the Los Angeles Times; Joel Pollak, the senior editor-at-large at Breitbart News; Nando Vila, vice president of programming for Fusion; Hannah Cranston, host and executive producer of the Young Turks’ Think Tank; and Ken LaCorte, founder of LaCorte News and former senior vice president of FoxNews.com. 
The conversation began with a discussion on how political reporting has changed since Trump’s election and about the meaning and role of fake news.
Cranston said that because the audience of The Young Turks tends to be younger, the information she shares typically breaks down what is happening in the political world.
“My challenge has been not only giving the information to them, but also creating a precedent and understanding for how they approach media and how they approach what’s going on in the world,” Cranston said. “I am trying to not only explain what is going on in the political atmosphere, but also trying to impart a sense of empathy and accountability that is really difficult when the person in the highest seat in the country is not providing an example of that.”
Along with the discussion on the differences of audience ages, LaCorte said that news has become polarized because of social media.
“We have a little bit of a danger of being allowed to live in our own little bubbles of social media where people get very distinct news just reaffirming what you want to hear,” LaCorte said. “I find it fascinating, but [I’m] not quite sure where it’s headed.”
Pollak said that reporting has not changed since Trump’s election and the beginning of his presidency.
“I just think that the media are more of a monoculture than they once were and so they’re confronting the president in a way that conservatives maybe confronted [former President] Barack Obama, questioned things he said and comments he made,” Pollak said. “It’s not that strange for presidents to say odd things or to break promises or to overstate the case for their point of view or whatever. The difference is that so many of the journalists over the past decade were used to a different kind of relationship with the president.”
After the moderated discussion, the panel opened up to questions from the audience. People asked about the validity of mainstream media and the importance of media literacy.
Raphael Krigel, a junior majoring in communication, asked Pollak about the role Breitbart News played in the growing racist movements in the United States. Pollak responded that Breitbart had nothing to do with the movements. 
“Some people in that movement were drawn to Donald Trump for the wrong reasons, just like there were some people drawn to Barack Obama for the wrong reasons,” Pollak said. 
Krigel said that Pollak’s response was what he expected. 
“It’s kind of avoiding the issue, which is the fact that these racist movements are absolutely on the rise and the data is showing that,” Krigel said. “[Breitbart] is absolutely associated with the movement he represents and the movement our president represents and that’s extremely troubling.”
However, Krigel said that he was glad to have the opportunity to listen to a different perspective. 
“I’m glad Annenberg is putting together events with a really diverse panel,” Krigel said. “It’s important that we open our ears and open our minds and really listen to each other, especially in a time when the country is so divided.”

USC recently partnered with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority to survey the homeless demographic of Los Angeles. The homeless census will be used to inform future policy decisions.
This is the first time that USC social workers have worked in conjunction with LAHSA, the lead agency in the Los Angeles Continuum of Care, which manages over $132 million annually in federal, state, county and city funds.
LAHSA provides assistance to more than 100 non-profit agencies that help homeless people achieve independence and stability in permanent housing through funding, program design, outcomes assessment and technical assistance.
According to their website, LAHSA’s partner agencies “provide a continuum of programs ranging from outreach, access centers, emergency shelters, safe havens, transitional and permanent housing and prevention, along with the necessary supportive services designed to provide the tools and skills required to attain a stable housing environment.”
Though it is standard practice for LAHSA to distribute responsibilities among multiple organizations, USC will be in charge of the methodology, survey and statistical analysis for this project. About 30 USC-affiliated surveyors, including graduates as well as doctoral and Master’s of Social Work students, went out into the field to interact with homeless individuals.
The surveyors asked homeless citizens questions regarding their health, disabilities, domestic violence and the amount of time they have been homeless. The USC researchers also ensured that demographics that were harder to find, such as those for youth, families and women, were accounted for as well.
The study found that more than half of the homeless people surveyed preferred to live on the street than in temporary housing and shelters, since they are often crowded and dirty. There was also a consensus among the population that the government funding should be allocated toward permanent housing.
Though homeless people hope to reside in a permanent home, it could often take a couple years for someone to make it on a waiting list. Also, many cannot afford to take such a long-term perspective, the researchers said.

Former USC linebackers Osa Masina and Don Hill will not be criminally prosecuted in Los Angeles for sexual assault, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office said Tuesday.
Masina and Hill were suspended from the football team in September after a woman claimed that they forced intercourse. The woman said she was in a state where she had no control over her body.
Masina argued that the act was consensual and that Hill did not have sex with the victim. 
The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office stated in a release on Tuesday that there is “insufficient evidence” to prove that the victim was unable to legally consent. 
This is due to the delay between the incident and the report by the victim, meaning that there is no physical evidence or toxicology reports.
Hill is cleared of charges, as there is no evidence of any subsequent instances of assault.
Masina, on the other hand, will still stand trial in Salt Lake City for allegedly sexually assaulting the same 19-year-old woman in Utah two weeks after she said she was assaulted in Los Angeles.
The alleged victim and Masina attended the same party in their mutual hometown of Salt Lake City in July.
After consuming alcohol and illicit substances, the woman said she fell asleep in the basement of the house and awoke to Masina raping her. 
Masina will face first-degree rape and forced sodomy charges at the trial, which is scheduled for June 26.

Nick Entin | Daily TrojanAll hands on deck · Junior guard Jordan McLaughlin (left) and sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright prepare to lead the Trojans as they take on Washington in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament on Wednesday.
Four nights after defeating Washington 74-58 at the Galen Center to conclude the regular season, the Trojans will rematch against the Huskies in Las Vegas on Wednesday in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament. USC (23-8,
 10-8) finished the season 3-0 at neutral sites, recording December wins over Missouri State and Wyoming at the Orleans Arena in Las Vegas and beating BYU at the Staples Center. The stakes are higher now for the Trojans, who still remain on the bubble of the NCAA Tournament despite finishing Pac-12 play with a winning record.
“We know the Selection Committee will do what they do, and we have no control over that,” head coach Andy Enfield said.
Regardless of his team’s postseason fate, Enfield said he was proud of his team’s accomplishments thus far.
“I think it’s important to enjoy the moment,” he said. “Or else as a player, coach or associate of the program, you can get caught up in this business for four of five months with a lot of stress and a lot of pressure.”
USC is certainly not overlooking its third meeting of the season with the Huskies (9-21, 2-16). In the
Pac-12, sweeping a three-game season series is an uphill battle — one that the Trojans actually won last year when they defeated the Bruins for the third time in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament. But Wednesday’s game might look significantly different than Saturday’s, when both teams had a player sit out due to injury. USC lost freshman Jonah Mathews to a concussion over the weekend, but he is cleared to play in the tournament. The guard averaged 20.7 minutes per game this season and 7.4 points and has been among the top perimeter defenders on the squad.
Washington, meanwhile, has missed the presence of star freshman guard Markelle Fultz, who suffered a knee injury in early February. His status remains unknown for Wednesday. If the First Team Pac-12 guard does play, he will transform the Huskies’ squad. Fultz averaged 23.2 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game this season. He finished second in the conference in assists per game, just ahead of junior guard Jordan McLaughlin, a USC captain and reigning Pac-12 Player of the Week.
“Even with Markelle being hurt, this Washington team is really good and well-coached,” McLaughlin said.
McLaughlin is arguably playing at the top of his game right now. In the last two games, he has dished out 19 assists and scored 38 points.
“[Jordan’s] … our leader,” Enfield said. “When he plays at this level, he gets everyone involved.”
For USC to make a run this postseason, McLaughlin will have to spearhead the offense. He earned an All-Pac-12 Honorable Mention this season — one of three Trojans to receive an all-conference honor. Freshman guard De’Anthony Melton earned an Honorable Mention for the All-Pac-12 All-Defensive Team, and should Fultz play on Wednesday, Melton will have to put that defense to work against the fleet-footed guard.
Lastly, sophomore forward Chimezie Metu garnered three honors. In addition to being an Honorable Mention on the All-Academic team, he was named the Most Improved Player and earned a spot on the
All-Pac-12 Second Team. Metu finished the year averaging 14.4 points per game — 8 more than he averaged a year ago. As USC’s leading rebounder and second-leading scorer, he will also need an explosive March for the Trojans to exceed expectations.
Six-seed USC tips off against the 11-seed Huskies at 8:30 p.m. on Wednesday at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The winner of the matchup will move on to face third-seeded UCLA in the quarterfinals.

The Trojans commenced preparation for the 2017 football season Tuesday with their first spring practice of the offseason at Howard Jones Field. USC is coming off of a 52-49 victory over Penn State on Jan. 2, which clinched the school’s record 25th Rose Bowl Trophy. 
Head coach Clay Helton and his team are now preparing for the new season, which kicks off at home against Western Michigan on Sept. 2.
With the departure of receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster (declared for NFL Draft) and Darreus Rogers (graduation), USC enters 2017 without its top-two pass catchers from the previous season. Smith-Schuster and Rogers combined for 126 receptions and 1,610 receiving yards as a tandem last season. 
There is now fresh competition for playing time with their vacated positions. The Trojans have a total of 10 scholarship wide receivers; eight will still have underclassman standing in the fall. 
Two leading candidates to take up receiving duties for the Trojans are junior Deontay Burnett and sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. Burnett was a standout in USC’s Rose Bowl victory this January, as he reeled in 13 receptions for 164 yards and three scores against Penn State. 
“The receiving corps is very competitive,” Burnett said. “[It’s competitive] in the weight room and in the film room, and that’s what I like to see. We’re going to need our young guys.”
Redshirt freshman receivers Josh Imatorbhebhe, Velus Jones Jr. and Tyler Vaughns all made appearances at Tuesday’s spring practice. However, Trevon Sidney, another redshirt freshman receiver, was held out from practice as he recovers from offseason hip surgery. Sidney is scheduled to miss all spring workouts this offseason according to Helton. 
The offensive line unit was another position group that endured significant offseason losses. All-American and All-Pac-12 tackles Zach Banner and Chad Wheeler both graduated, and left guard Damien Mama is also no longer on the team after declaring for the 2017 NFL Draft following his junior season. 
While there have been plenty of changes up front, USC has several viable and experienced options to take the three crucial slots on its offensive front. Senior Viane Talamaivao is slated to be the opening-day right guard for the Trojans; he has started at guard for USC over the past three seasons. 
Following Tuesday’s practice, Helton announced that the team would tentatively be going with junior Chuma Edoga at left tackle and redshirt sophomore Roy Hemsley at right tackle. Redshirt junior Chris Brown received practice reps with the first team at left guard. Helton made sure to note that these slots were still open throughout the remainder of the spring and into the fall. 
Redshirt senior center Nico Falah sat out Tuesday’s practice with what Helton described as a “bit of a bad back,” but Helton said Falah should be back to practice in the coming weeks. Falah took over as USC’s starting center last season after Toa Lobendahn suffered a season-ending knee injury. Lobendahn, a redshirt junior, was limited at practice, still recovering from ACL surgery. 
The Trojans opened practice without redshirt senior kicker Matt Boermeester Tuesday. USC announced on Feb. 7 that Boermeester was indefinitely suspended from the team due to a violation of “code of conduct” policy.
Boermeester, who knocked through a 46-yard field goal to win the Rose Bowl in January, has been left off of the Trojans’ 2017 roster. 
“There’s been no change of his status,” Helton said. “If there is, I’ll be the first to let you know.” 
Filling in for Boermeester will be redshirt freshman kicker Michael Brown. Brown, who suffered a quadriceps injury last fall, will be slotted to take on all placekicking duties for the Trojans in the fall.

I’m not a huge NBA fan. Before moving to Los Angeles, I never lived in a state with a team, and the Big-12 filled all of my basketball needs during the winter and spring. 
So I’m never particularly tuned into the world of professional basketball unless I’m trying to tease my associate managing editor Eric He on the rare occasion that his beloved Golden State Warriors lose. But this weekend, the New York Knicks did something that caught my eye.
The Knicks don’t have a lot going for them, with a 26-38 record setting the tone for another disappointing season for faithful fans. But on Sunday, they hit the right note in their first half against the Warriors.
No, they didn’t knock off the
so-called Best Team in America. But the Knicks made the decision to cut out all the antics that are so typical of the NBA — the T-shirt cannons and loud music and constant egging on from the loudspeakers. It was refreshing, a break from the showmanship of the league to focus on the game that actually mattered.
On the same day, I attended my first NBA game at the Staples Center. It wasn’t a bad game, ending with a scrappy comeback by the Los Angeles Lakers and a tight finish by the New Orleans Pelicans. But after three hours of witnessing “NBA magic,” I was exhausted by all of the extracurriculars that came with the game.
As the Lakers’ introductions began, the lights dropped and spotlights spun around the haphazard crowd in the Staples Center. In the course of the Lakers’ 105-97 loss to New Orleans, the program ran its crowd through a gamut of flashy song-and-dance routines, complete with everything from kiss cams to Star Wars sound effects during free throws.
Yet the most genuine — and the loudest — moments of crowd interaction came without any artificial prompting at all. No spotlights, no announcer, no cheesy organ playing or early-2000s hip hop music were required to get the crowd rowdy when the game called for it. 
The fans roared when their players slammed down a hammer dunk in the first quarter and shook the backboard with a ferocious block in the second. They booed fiercely whenever DeMarcus Cousins took to the free throw line and slung heartfelt insults at the referees whenever a call went against the Lakers.
It wasn’t the loudest crowd I’ve ever heard — that would be the Kansas Jayhawks in their third overtime against Oklahoma last season — and it wasn’t the most involved, either. But that’s to be expected when a team is sitting at the bottom of their conference with a 19-43 record. And for a team with that record and those prospects, those fans were doing their very best.
That’s the thing about fans. They don’t need fancy lights or over-the-top intros. They know their role — chant taunts after an airball, hold their breaths during free throws and holler at the referees after every call. There are many things that fans want, including winning seasons and championship rings, but they really only need some heart, a voice and a pair of hands to slap together to fulfill their main purpose on the sidelines.
That’s one of the reasons I adore college ball so much. I come from the Midwest, where college teams are just as big of a deal as their professional counterparts. Earlier this season, half of my high school classmates helped to break a Guinness record for sound produced by a crowd at a Kansas basketball game. 
Those games don’t need anything but a band and 16,000 rowdy fans to create the type of intimidating atmosphere that sends opposing teams packing. So why should NBA games be any different?
There isn’t necessarily a need to cut all of the antics out of the NBA — I’ll never begrudge a team its chance to launch free T-shirts into the crowd or kill time during halftime with a fan 3-point shooting contest. 
But the Lakers could learn something from the Knicks, and from the wild world of college ball — killing some of the effects and letting their fans do the talking. They might find out that the crowd is stronger than they expected.

Freshman swimmer Louise Hansson is always up for a challenge.
Ever since she was introduced to baby swim classes at the age of one, there has never been a task too difficult for the Sweden native. She’s won numerous medals at the junior and senior level in Europe, set national records in various events and even represented her home country this past summer at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.
But instead of waiting around for the next Olympic cycle to come, Hansson wanted a change of scenery to help hone her skills. So she decided to come to a university in the United States in order to pursue an education and have the opportunity to swim competitively. She landed at USC — a school known for cultivating some of the world’s best international swimming talent — and has since continued that storied tradition in her impressive freshman campaign, setting numerous school records and leading the Trojans to a top-five ranking in the country.
However, not everything has been an easy transition for Hansson. In fact, she’s had to adjust to quite a bit since making the 5,574-mile trek from Helsingborg to Los Angeles. When she first arrived, Hansson was taken aback by the warm greetings and friendliness shown to her by Americans.
“In Europe, we don’t really talk to people we don’t know,” Hansson said with a laugh. “We’re a little more quiet and reserved compared to people in the States, so when I first got here, I was surprised to see so many random people saying, ‘Hi,’ to me and asking how I was doing.”
Los Angeles itself is also a big change from her hometown, a small coastal city known for its proximity to both the forest and the ocean. She misses the ease with which she could travel around town — only a 15-minute bike ride separates her from the city, the beach and the forest — and the abundance of nature around her.
The weather in Helsingborg, however, definitely does not compare to Los Angeles.
“It’s probably raining or snowing back home right now,” Hansson said. “It’s definitely in the negatives too … in Celsius, though. I’m still not and probably will never get used to Fahrenheit.”
Hansson also takes a little more time to read or write a paper at USC, and getting used to swimming in yards rather than meters has been a steep learning curve.
“I had to find an online converter tool just to understand what I was swimming,” Hansson said. 
In addition, the fact that there were nearly 50 members on the swim team was also a shock. 
“We only have about 10 people in my group back in Sweden, and there were only two or three girls total,” Hansson said. “But here we have 20, so that’s actually pretty nice — being able to swim against girls for once.”
Perhaps the most difficult adjustment for Hansson, however, has been being so far away from home.
“It’s different not seeing my family every day or getting to talk to them. I miss them a lot,” she said. “Even just having dinner with them — I miss that. I’ve been eating in the dining halls all the time since I’ve been here and it gets a little tiring, so I miss getting that home-cooked meal and just sitting at the dinner table with my family.”
Like most international freshmen, Hansson has taken a while to adjust to the new environment, language, culture and social customs in the United States. However, the one thing that she is — and always has been — familiar with is swimming.
At a lean 6-feet-2-inches with long limbs, Hansson has the prototypical body type for a swimmer. Her size and speed allow her to effortlessly glide through the water, while her strength and versatility make her a threat in numerous events. She says butterfly and freestyle are her preferred strokes, but she’s also strong in the individual medley. Luckily for head coach Dave Salo, the Swedish Olympian has been up for the challenge that collegiate swimming presents.
Hansson made a splash in her Trojan debut back in September, winning three events (the 200y free,
100y fly and the 200y IM) in USC’s season opening victory over Washington State in Pullman. She then followed that performance up with first-place finishes in the 200y free and the
200y IM at the SMU Women’s Classic in Texas two weeks later.
In late February, Hansson also turned heads at the Pac-12 Championships in Federal Way, Wash. Not only did she capture the Pac-12 title in the 100y fly with a school record time of 50.39 seconds (the second fastest in the nation this year) to become USC’s fourth conference winner in the event, but she also tied for third in the 100y free and set a school record in the 400y medley relay (3:27.88) with teammates sophomore Hanni Leach, sophomore Riley Scott and senior Anika Apostalon — good for the third-fastest time in the country. Along the way, Hansson also posted a third-place finish in the 200y IM with a personal record of 1:53.72, which made her the second-fastest Trojan ever in the event behind school record holder and three-time Rio gold medalist Katinka Hosszu.
While mirroring Hosszu’s success in the Olympics would be considered a tall task for almost anyone not named Michael Phelps, it’s certainly not impossible for Hansson, who already has her sights set on the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo. She hopes her time at USC will help get her there. For now though, she is focused on the 2017 NCAA Championships in Indianapolis next week.
“I’m so excited,” Hansson said. “Everyone on the team is ready to go, and we’re going in with confidence. Even though it’s all going to be very new to me, I have really high ambitions and goals for myself, so I’m ready for the challenge.”

After a bye week, the No. 4 women’s lacrosse team is set to face Boston University at 2 p.m. on Wednesday at McAlister Field. For the Trojans, this marks the first time they have ever faced off against the Terriers, and head coach Lindsay Munday welcomed the opportunity to play an unfamiliar team. 
“It’s exciting to play a new opponent, to get a fresh face,” Munday said. “They’re a great team, and we need to be ready for a full competition of 60 minutes.” 
Junior goalie Caroline Meegan anchors BU in the cage, as she is
third-best in the Patriot League with a .488 save percentage. On offense, junior attacker Avery Donahoe is a force to be reckoned with, notching eight goals and four assists through the first four games of the season. 
After a trip to Florida last weekend began with a loss to then-No. 4 Florida (though they bounced back to beat Stetson), the Trojans took advantage of the week off from competition to get back to the basics and focus on getting better each day. 
“This week we’ve just been picking up from our Florida trip and really trying to fix the mistakes that we had on that trip,” junior goalie Gussie Johns said. “[We’re] just trying to continue to grow as we move to each game and to build on the things that we’ve worked on this week.”
After winning 23 of its last 25 games, USC suffered its lone loss of the season so far against the Gators before conquering Stetson 18-3 to improve its record to 3-1. In the commanding victory, eight different Trojans found the scoresheet, with four girls recording hat tricks.
“Against Stetson, we really moved the ball well,” Munday said. “Offensively we want to be as dynamic as possible. It’s about sharing the ball and trusting each other and waiting for the best opportunity.”
The Trojan offense is spearheaded by two-time All-American attacker Michaela Michael, who leads the MPSF in draw controls and is the league’s fifth all-time leading goal scorer. Michael is joined by senior attackers Kylie Drexel, Gabby McMahon and Cynthia del Core, who have combined for 28 points so far this season. 
On defense, USC features Johns in goal; the junior is second in the MPSF in goals-against average and save percentage. Senior Nina Kelty and junior Lydia Sutton patrol the cage in front of Johns and have caused five turnovers apiece in 2017. 
With fresh energy, USC looks to continue building on the foundation it created at the start of the season and avoid getting caught up in the big picture. 
“We’re just focusing on the little things and focusing internally rather than getting too consumed with the end of the season,” Johns said. “We were so successful last year because we focused on one game at a time and focused on us rather than who our opponents were.” 
With this mindset, the Trojans look to execute their gameplan come Wednesday against the Terriers. After that, USC will welcome another first-time opponent to McAlister Field, as Munday’s squad takes on New Hampshire on Monday at 4 p.m.

Music and dance, though perceived to be completely distinct disciplines, are actually complementary. The Choreographers and Composers Concert, an event that showcases the talents of Glorya Kaufman School of Dance and Thornton School of Music students, will present the students’ original works — developed over the past several weeks —  starting Wednesday.
The event is one of the first collaborations between the student dancers and artists from these respective programs, a unique opportunity for USC artists to thrive, as they merge their innovative minds together to create a truly authentic performance. 
The event was organized by Thomas McManus and Sean Friar. His intention was to bring the two departments together so that these young artists could gain insight into the creative processes of artists in vastly different disciplines. McManus and Friar gathered 33 student choreographers and seven student composers to collaborate for the event.
“It started out with the composers presenting their music to the dancers and choreographers,” said Logan Nelson, a sophomore majoring in music composition. “We showed them some pieces and just talked with them about what interests us.”
Evidently, this was an extremely organic process — both the musicians and dancers were encouraged to hone in on their specific interests in order to maximize their creative opportunities with other student performers. 
The students were encouraged to express their artistic tastes before deciding who they would work with for the performance. As a result, both groups found individuals best suited for their designated talents and artistic goals. From there, the dancers were given the opportunity to select which composers they felt suited their choreographic styles and preferred musical genre. 
Before presenting their compositions to the dancers, however, the Thornton musicians also collaborated closely with their colleagues in the composing process. Some even worked to create pieces that combined seemingly unusual combinations of instruments and sounds. 
“I started out this project working very closely with the talented violinist junior Maddy Manasse,” Nelson said. “We worked together to sample unique and interesting violin textures that I later produced into electronic elements for the piece. I’ll be triggering these electronic elements live and playing piano while also incorporating a live drummer and violinist.”
According to the students, this collaborative process was very much in line with what they’ve been learning in their respective departments, especially as they prepare to launch their artistic careers beyond USC. Beyond sheer professional applicability, however, choreographers and composers served as a vital muse for the performers as they created their original pieces.
“For me, collaboration is a major inspiration for my music,” Nelson said. “Whether it be with a filmmaker, musician, playwright or dancer, I believe that when art is combined it creates more powerful art.” 
The student performers have prepared a wide variety of material, including dances set to rappers as well as more traditional vocalists. In addition, the musicians will use an array of instruments, some of which include the drums, a violin, a pipe organ and an accordion. The performance will be presented twice, starting Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and concluding Thursday at the same time. Admission is free, and reservations are required.
The Kaufman and Thornton students participating in the event are eager to not only their work, but also to gain more experience undertaking such collaborative projects in the future. 
“I’m really excited for the performance,” Nelson said. “It’s truly one of the coolest projects I’ve ever been a part of.”
Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the event’s name as “Choreographers and Composers Night.” The event’s actual name is “Choreographers and Composers Concert.” The article also stated Dean Robert Cutietta organized the event. The organizers of the event were actually Thomas McManus and Sean Friar. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

With plenty of poke shops popping up around and throughout the Los Angeles area, it can be difficult for shop owners to distinguish themselves among the sea of poke — yet Sweetfin Poké does so with an air of grace. The friendly staff and sparkling floor-to-ceiling windows elevate the shop while adding a breath of fresh air to the upscale area of West Third Street in West Hollywood.
Walking into the cool-toned blue and wooded interior, the customer is placed into a breezy setting, as the intricately caged light fixtures add a touch of elegance to the sun-filled atmosphere. A wrap-around wooden bench and striped, square tables made for parties of two line the walls in the casual convex layout of the restaurant. 
A marble counter bar looks into the bustling open kitchen and offers extra indoor seating, though the outdoor seating should not be passed up. A great area for people-watching and casual conversation, the spacious patio provides a breezy atmosphere for enjoying a meal with friends and family. 
The menu is separated into three rope-hung fixtures and categorized into three options: signature bowls, build-your-own bowls (BYOB) and add-ons. As with most poke shops, the signature bowls at Sweetfin are standardized to help alleviate the stressful decision-making for the first-time poke-goers, offering nine eclectic bowls to choose from.
Each customer is offered three distinct base options to pile their toppings onto: bamboo rice, kelp noodle-cucumber slaw and citrus-kale salad. For both the signature and BYOB options, customers can top their colorful poke creations with ingredients from the expansive add-on list. 
This list is split into four categories — premium, crunchy, herbs and spices and fruit and veggies — with topping options ranging from macadamia nuts and wasabi peas to chile oil and pineapple. 
Sweetfin’s signature bowls encompass the more popular items ordered from the shop while offering variety and ample amounts of flavor. For those that are just getting into the poke scene, the classic tuna bowl is the route to take, featuring a simple combination of tuna, classic sauce, white and green onions, sesame seeds and red chile. The mango albacore bowl and the spicy yuzu salmon bowl offer more adventurous combinations without compromising taste, with the former boasting ponzu-lime sauce and macadamia nuts, while the latter offers tasty yuzu kosho sauce and edamame. 
Not wanting to leave any customer out, Sweetfin also offers vegan bowls, featuring a simple shiitake chile tofu bowl and a more complex vegetable poke bowl, which includes sweet potatoes, carrots, avocado, cucumbers and serrano. 
An attribute that Sweetfin has taken pride in is its philosophy of “From Pole to Bowl,” in which they source their fish from sustainable and high-quality resources. In addition, the menu is gluten- and dairy-free, allowing those with allergies to have peace of mind while they enjoy their meals. 
Although this effort is commendable, the prices are debatable. The price range for the snack-sized small bowls is
between $7.95 and $9.95, while the large bowls range from $11.95 to $13.95. This price increases with add-ons, depending on the size of each bowl. Because most people need the large bowl to satiate their appetites, this price can seem expensive for the amount given. However, it is not out of the ordinary when compared to the restaurants and shops surrounding Sweetfin in the affluent West Third Street area. 
With this in mind, the fresh produce and high-quality ingredients may make up for the higher prices. These components make Sweetfin Poké a definite place to stop and try on a day out and they may award the restaurant a permanent spot in the competitive West Hollywood food scene. 
Sweetfin Poké is located on West Third Street and is open daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.

The word “uncanny” is thrown around a lot in both an artistic and everyday context, but it wasn’t until a Thematic Option course last semester that I was introduced to the term’s Freudian definition. According to Freud, uncanniness occurs when an unfamiliar, repressed truth comes to light in a familiar environment. When this happens, you realize that this truth was always there, and it changes everything because nothing is what it seemed to be. Eeriness begins to set in. Suddenly, the familiar begins to feel unfamiliar, and we aren’t so sure of anything anymore.
When stoked and manipulated well, uncanniness elicits a fear both primal and devastating. You’re suddenly set on edge, hyper-aware of the fragility of the world around you. But you must also deal with a tragic truth — that your reality was never what you thought it was. Sometimes that reality is a place or a thing, but more often than not it is the people you thought you knew. And these feelings, layered together, evoke a heightened shock so raw that only the best horror movies and books can pull it off. 
Or, you know, real life. But of course, art draws from that anyway, and the best horror films are those in which physical danger and searing social commentary come to a head. Such is the case in Get Out, director Jordan Peele’s new horror-comedy, a relentlessly spun-out, take-no-prisoners examination of blackness in America. 
What Peele achieves with Get Out is nothing short of remarkable. The boundary between funny and frightening is a thin line to walk, but Peele does so all the while thrusting a mirror in the viewer’s face. He blasts the vulnerability, confusion and despair of being stereotyped, targeted and marginalized into the suffocation of horror — and the message his movie contains is one the viewer cannot escape.
Invited home to meet his girlfriend Rose Armitage’s (Allison Williams) family for the first time, Chris (Danie Kaluuya) finds himself in an uncomfortable situation that slowly gets creepier and creepier. Rose’s parents, played by Bradley Whitford and Catherine Keener, are not just accepting of Chris’ relationship with their daughter — they eagerly delight over it. And so do their upper-class white friends. 
Everyone is fascinated by Chris, with what athletic feats they think he can do and his supposed sexual strengths. To make things worse, Rose’s mother is hypnotizing Chris in paralyzing episodes that cure his smoking habit but also propel him into a dark “Sunken Place” through which he cannot move or make noise. And also, who are the mysterious, creepily smiling black employees who work on the family grounds? 
Unsurprisingly, some really terrifying stuff is at work. And, caution — spoilers to the movie may lie ahead. Rose’s family is, of course, not what they seem. But for the entire movie, Chris believes Rose is on his side because through all her family’s obsession and fixation on his race, she must truly love him. Right? 
It all culminates in a chilling scene that propels the movie into its third act, in which Chris frantically tries to gather up Rose to leave the Armitage residence before things can get any worse. (Really, who better to portray the essence of unbothered white femininity than Marnie from Girls?) But while Rose is searching for her bag, Chris makes a terrifying discovery in the closet of her childhood bedroom: a shoebox containing a series of romantic selfies of Rose with exclusively black men and one black woman.
Imagine, for a moment, that Get Out is a film of an entirely different genre, that it is perhaps a drama in the vein of Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner. Would the shoebox scene change anything, make the situation less devastating? No. And that is the root of the uncanny, one that Peele blossoms into overt horror but that remains nonetheless as terrifying as if it had happened in real life. It’s the insertion of the unfamiliar, the horrifying truth, into your calm and happy existence, and it’s that realization that changes everything. That the woman you thought you loved perhaps never loved you, only the color of your skin, and that the part of you which you don’t see walking around through the world is the only thing people see when they look at you. 
The devastation this truth conjures is real. And though Get Out is very specifically about the experiences of black Americans, this situation has happened to me as an Asian American and remains true as long as races and groups of people are fetishized for nothing more than the bodies they were born with. 
With clear visual references to cotton-picking and physical restraints, Get Out emphatically concludes that centuries after the practice of slavery was abolished, black Americans have always been and will continue to be judged and perceived first by their bodies. Less of a comment on interracial dating than on America’s twisted perceptions of black people, Get Out layers rich symbolism on top of masterful, gripping humor to create a staggering, unforgiving work. It is a movie as important to understand as it is to be entertained by.

The most dreaded time of the semester for USC students is undoubtedly finals week. The universal anxiety over impending grade-determining evaluations and the compact nature of final examinations have the combined effect of making students feel very stressed — and very unhappy. Finals week is widely known as the time of the semester when students don’t sleep, allow themselves to relax or even enjoy the company of other human beings. This means that midterms, which are currently spaced out according to each professor’s determined schedule, taking place over the course of one or two weeks would probably have a similar effect. There is simply no compelling reason to impose such a burden on students twice or more throughout the course of the semester.
Normally, midterm due dates are spaced out according to each instructor’s preference. In my experience, this typically means that more time in the semester is allotted for more time-consuming assignments, like midterm papers or multiple midterms for a single class. This general rule is not universal, but most professors are aware of the typical behavior of other professors and plan accordingly already. If midterms were compacted into a single week once or twice per semester, students would experience several periods of immense, concentrated stress. Additionally, if all midterms were relegated to a single week, students would no longer have the ability to prioritize and space out their work schedule in order to accommodate their individual circumstances.  
Everything would be due all at once, and if there is one thing that is true of the typical college student, it is that they do not typically handle multiple large assignments due at once very well — hence the aforementioned fear of finals week.
Furthermore, bringing midterms together for one or two weeks may have negative effects on learning efficiency in the classroom. I know from personal experience that students typically see a drop in their performance in class sessions immediately following a midterm due date. Students are typically not mentally present during class on the day of or the day following a midterm. Finals are different in that once the examinations are over, classes do not continue, and so the effects stemming from mental exhaustion do not rear their ugly head quite so clearly in May. Treating midterms like finals will bring that mental exhaustion into play in the middle of the semester — exactly when many students need to be the most present in their classes.
The ad-hoc way that midterms are currently administered is not perfect — that much is freely admitted. But, scheduling all of students’ midterms into a single week or two likely will not improve matters. If anything, it will only take the stress that is more or less evenly distributed throughout the semester and compress it into one or two terrifying weeks. How this would help student academic performance after the more compact examinations are over is not immediately clear, especially in light of commonplace post-examination student behaviors like binge-watching television and attending parties that typically do not augment classroom learning.
Perhaps the bigger problem is not the way that midterms are currently administered, but rather the way that students sometimes approach their classwork. Many students do not do work until they have just enough time to complete it before their deadline. Moreover, students tend to spend a great deal of time engaging in non-academic pursuits that could be used more constructively. If students were to use that time wisely and prepared themselves more ahead of time, it may be that midterm season wouldn’t sting quite as much.

We’re officially almost done with the ninth week of the semester, also the peak of midterm season for most USC students. However, for many students, we’ve been at this peak since around week five. Without a consistently defined midterm week, many students are subjected to a never-ending series of stressful exams that span the majority of the semester. Establishing two specific midterm weeks would ensure students have a lighter courseload in the time leading up to midterms, as well as adequate time to de-stress afterwards. 
Last week, I had two midterm exams and projects. After spending most of the week feverishly working, all I wanted to do this weekend was catch up on Netflix and sleep. Instead, I immediately had to shift gears into studying for my next two midterms. 
Creating official “midterm weeks” around the one-third and two-thirds dates of the semester would condense the midterm season, allowing students to actually take a break in between exams. While this would definitely make those two weeks particularly stressful, it also would ease the burden of the other 13 weeks of the semester. 
With two designated midterm weeks, professors would be able to plan their schedules accordingly, resulting in a lighter course load in the weeks immediately before and after midterm week. I’ve had several professors say things like, “I wanted to schedule this assignment for after you all finished midterms in other classes, but you all have different midterm dates so that’s impossible.” 
Having established midterm dates would solve this problem, ensuring that you don’t need to waste any time completing busy work and regular homework assignments when you should be studying for midterms. 
Students would still be able to prioritize their work schedule; many already are juggling conflicting midterm dates with a variety of projects, papers, and exams. Students may not be able to space out their work schedule across different deadlines, but they still could choose to prioritize one midterm at a time, regardless of the deadline. While the current system allows students to have more time to work on projects due after midterms, a system with established exam weeks could save them time to work on all midterms. 
Currently, when studying for a midterm (or several), students also juggle random assignments in other classes, and do not begin studying for one midterm until they are finished with the more pressing ones. A system of two midterm weeks would save time, since students wouldn’t need to wait until they get through one midterm to move onto the next. And since most professors don’t give difficult assignments leading up to a midterm, if all classes were about to have midterms, none of the classes would have difficult assignments, creating an unofficial dead week. In this way, students could prepare for midterms without the distraction of other assignments, or other midterms that they need to get through first. 
Most importantly, this system would provide students with a much-needed mental break following their midterms. While students obviously wouldn’t be able to completely check out the way they can after finals, they could actually take a breath and have time to relax, knowing that there aren’t more midterms immediately around the corner. The weekend and week following midterm weeks would provide students with valuable time to focus on self-care and catching up on sleep, something that is severely lacking with USC’s current method of almost-weekly midterms. Though midterm weeks would be highly stressful, students also would have more time to destress. 
A bonus of this system is that it would help student organizations with planning important dates. It is likely that students in clubs and organizations are constantly forced to miss meetings or retreats in order to prepare for upcoming midterms. It currently is impossible for organizations to solve this issue, since on any given week, students are taking midterms. If students all had their midterms at the same time, organizations would know to avoid planning important events during those weeks. 
Midterms are undoubtedly the worst. Spending less time during the semester worrying about them could make them a little bit better. It’s like ripping off a band-aid — it’s better to quickly get midterms over with, instead of dragging them out and allowing them to taint the entire semester.

I may be one of the few people my age who still sees the value in unpaid internships. 
I don’t believe in free, exploited labor, but the beauty of an unpaid internship lies in the age-old tradition of apprenticeship. Young adults works for a professional who is a master in their field, gaining experience, skills and craft in return. 
As a college student, I understand perfectly that not everyone can afford an unpaid internship, especially with the high cost of attending school (which can sometimes feel like selling our souls to the devil — or a loan officer — just to meet the tuition fees).
Unpaid internships are undoubtedly more suitable for teens who don’t have to worry about paying bills. But I also think it’s a shame to pass on internship opportunities just because they don’t pay. Some of my greatest professional experiences came from unpaid internships, including my time as a student ambassador at Glendale City Hall and an intern for the Armenian National Committee of Western Region. I didn’t get monetary pay for my time, but I received invaluable skills, experience and opportunities in return, building relationships and friendships that remain important to me until this very day. 
I understand why students seek paying jobs over unpaid internships, but at the end of the day, it’s just a matter of cost-benefit analysis. If the internship will help you grow professionally (and often personally, as was the case for me), then it’s worth taking it on despite not getting paid. Sometimes, it can even lead to a paying job with that particular organization or company. Many of our predecessors and some of the most successful people in the world swallowed their pride and took on such opportunities before making it big. The Huffington Post names a few of these individuals:
