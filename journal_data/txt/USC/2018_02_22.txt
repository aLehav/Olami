Once every two years, a small, elite group of athletes become household names, rising to the forefront of national consciousness. During the Olympics, all eyes and — arguably, more importantly — all ears are on them, what they do and what they say; but sometimes, it’s their presence alone that speaks volumes. With athletes like Adam Rippon, Mirai Nagasu, Chloe Kim and Nathan Chen occupying that very public space in this particular moment in our nation’s history, it’s clear why that’s the case.
Ever since the rise of President Donald Trump, “politics” tends to be forbidden from major sporting and entertainment events. Participants in such events are instead expected to passively fall in line with a status quo of silence and oppression. 
It’s rare that this long-established set-up is challenged on a large-scale. But the rhetoric and policies of the current administration strike every day at the core of our increasingly diverse American landscape. With the 2018 Winter Olympics underway and a Team USA defined by its unprecedented diversity, this set-up is turned over on its head automatically. 
At the heart of the “Make America Great Again” agenda that drove Trump’s presidential campaign to its deeply unsettling victory, the “again” has always implied a regression of the social progress that’s empowered women, minorities and LGBTQ people, and a restoration of a time when America was exclusively “great” for straight, cis, white men. 
In other words, the word “politics” and the demand to steer clear of said politics imply a false voluntariness, as if involving oneself in activism and social consciousness is a choice made as easily and conveniently as what to wear in the morning. But for essentially all except for non-white, cisgender, heterosexual men, simply to take up space and exist anywhere — let alone on the global stage, competing to represent an America rocked by renewed divisiveness — is a political act that comes with a staggering amount of pressure. For Olympians of marginalized groups, they are representing not only their country, but also an entire group that will sweepingly be associated with them — and they know it.

Individuals in any underrepresented group carry the weight of all expectations and perceptions of that group on their shoulders whenever they do anything, for better or for worse. The politicizing and generalizing that go hand-in-hand with members of minority groups add a degree of pressure, attention and expectation their non-minority counterparts aren’t subjected to. 
And yet, many members of  Team USA have more than risen to the occasion: Nagasu, a figure skater, became the first female American competitor to perform a triple axel, while Kim seized the gold medal in her snowboarding competition, proving herself to be a shining beacon of the sport’s future. And on top of his dazzling performance on the ice, Rippon drew attention prior to the opening ceremonies for his courageous rebuking of Vice President Mike Pence’s record of intolerance toward LGBTQ people when it was revealed the vice president would lead the U.S. delegation. While off the ice, he’s continued to dish one iconic quote after another and unabashedly be himself — a light-hearted yet unmistakably political act at a time of highly politicized social tensions regarding what it means to be an American.
We also shouldn’t ignore the quiet grace of 18-year-old Nathan Chen, who was portrayed as an inevitable gold medalist by the media and marketed as the face of American figure skating with the fortune of a nation seemingly placed on his young shoulders. Chen’s journey to the Olympics was a path paved with perfection and exceptionalism which have always been the direct results of his inspirational work ethic. This is often the case for people of color in their pursuit of the far too limited spaces allotted for them. In either case, it was this very perfection and exceptionalism, this sense of collective entitlement by our nation to reap the rewards of his hard work, that made his struggles and shortcomings that much more surprising and emotional.
Many have dismissed accusations that his mistakes were triggered by excessive media pressure because all athletes, no matter how old and no matter their backgrounds, face tremendous pressure. Perhaps there’s some truth to this; but either way, Chen added a human dimension to the Olympics by reminding us that athletes are imperfect individuals who respond to situations differently, that no one is impervious to the weight of expectations, that anyone can get back up and recover. Chen does so as a Chinese American, rising from his falls to tell underrepresented viewers that they, too, can rise. 
Activism isn’t always picket signs and coordinated protests and marches. As Rippon has fought homophobia and bigotry with bold, fearless statements, Chen and his fellow Asian American athletes have fought nativism and racism with their chosen medium of quiet dignity. Rippon and Chen have both shown that American heroes come from all backgrounds — that regardless of any aspect of your identity, there is no limit to what you can achieve, nor any expectation of perfection. They may send these messages differently, but everyone has the right to tell their story in their own way. At the end of the day, that is the beauty and promise of American diversity.

When I was two years old, my three- and nine-year-old cousins were attending summer camp at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in Granada Hills, Calif. A gunman opened fire on the community center, prompting children and teachers to hide in closets and cabinets and run for their lives. Five people were wounded, three of whom were children, and one man was killed. It was Aug. 10, 1999; the shooter was a white supremacist, and he carried a semi-automatic weapon.
In the second month of my freshman year at the University of Oregon, I received a text from campus police that Umpqua Community College was in an active shooter situation. I was put on lock down for two hours while the shooter was still at large. It was Oct. 1, 2015; nine people were killed and the shooter carried five handguns and a semi-automatic weapon.
This past Wednesday, my family received a text: “Dani is okay” was attached to an article titled “Active Shooter at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL.” I was driving in the car with my mom when I saw the blood drain from her face. He called my cousin, who answered the phone promptly and, through sobs, informed me that she was safe at Walmart with my aunt. Nineteen years later, my family was experiencing the same thing again. I watched the news on my phone — police and SWAT teams flooded the scene and painstakingly, slowly evacuated classrooms of children. Later we came to learn that the gunman had gone to Walmart and was mingling in the crowd at the same time that my cousin and her mother were there.
Through a stroke of luck, Dani had not been in her class at the moment the shooter entered that room. He killed four people in her classroom, including a beautiful girl who sat right in front of my baby cousin. It was Feb. 14, 2018, and 17 more innocent lives were taken by a man with a semi-automatic weapon.
I grew up in Parkland, Fla. If I walked across the street from my house and through my neighbor’s backyard, I would end up standing in front of MSD High School. I learned how to bike in front of that school, I watched my older cousins play soccer on its field, it was the high school all my cousins and friends attended and it was the high school I was supposed to attend.
Parkland is still my community, my family. My heart breaks for the pain and suffering the victims’ families and the survivors in my community are going through right now; it is a pain no one should ever have to feel. Ever.
I am now a student at the University of Southern California. Last week after the massacre, I didn’t attend class. I was grief-stricken, depressed and genuinely concerned for my own safety. Why should I be worried to step onto my campus, a place of learning, enrichment and growth? I asked my mom, “Why does my fear or opinion on the issue even matter?” She replied, “Ari, if it’s not you today, it might be you tomorrow.”
Each incident I described above involved a semi-automatic weapon. This is not about humans or race or gender. This pain is about guns. It is about the ridiculous ease of acquiring a weapon. It is about the fact that anyone can legally buy a semi-automatic weapon before they can buy a beer, cigarettes or a handgun. It is about the lack of background checks. It is about the silence from the National Rifle Association, and the disgraceful inaction of a government that clearly no longer serves its people. It is about a gun lobby so deeply entrenched in political corruption, and government leaders whose greed for money, power and status knows no limits. It is about grown men and women failing the children of our country. It is about politicians so blinded by their own greed they are willing to turn a blind eye to the loss of innocent lives.
I stand with the people of Parkland. I stand with the people of Las Vegas. I stand with the people of Orlando and Sandy Hook and Umpqua and Virginia Tech and University of Texas and Columbine High School and the other countless communities affected by our governments’ selfishness and irresponsibility. Be sure to understand, they do not stand with us.
To the President of the United States, I urge you to try to be the President you so often boast that you are. Embrace what public service truly means. Make a change. Actually make America great.
And friends and future leaders, when the President fails to do so, I urge you to call your representatives, make your voice heard and vote them out of office. Let us be the generation that changes this. Let’s make America safe again.
Ban military assault-style weapons and write common sense, stricter gun control legislation.

Minyon Moore, the starting sophomore point guard for USC women’s basketball, accused Oregon State’s fans of yelling racial slurs after the team’s 69-63 loss in Corvallis, Ore., on Sunday. Moore took to Twitter after the game, stating that the fans’ comments that she heard are “unacceptable” and tagged the Pac-12 Network and the Beavers’ official team Twitter saying, “You need to address this.”

She called out the school saying, “Oregon state thinks they have the best fans. … no, you have racist fans.” She also gave examples of what her team was called as they left the court in another tweet. “Oregon state fans calling us n***** after the end of the game great sportsmanship,” she wrote.
The posts have since been deleted, but her tweets made their point and were taken seriously by the Pac-12, Oregon State and USC.
Both USC and Oregon State have said they have begun investigating the complaint. Oregon State’s spokesman, Steve Clark, has stated that “there is no place … for racially derogatory actions or statements that are directed at student-athletes, coaches, officials or fans in attendance.” He also said that the school has already been in contact with USC officials in order to address this issue immediately.
USC’s Senior Associate Athletic Director Donna Heinel stated, “Both schools strongly agree that there is no place for such racially insensitive language in sports.” 
However, she also added her appreciation for the Pac-12 and Oregon State taking immediate action into investigating the incident.

It’s a situation that USC fans and followers have seen play out all-too-often this season: The Trojans jump out to a double-digit lead early in the second half, but then proceed to watch the lead evaporate in the closing moments of the game. 
In the Trojans’ rout over the Buffaloes, senior guard Elijah Stewart broke the USC 3-point field goal record (previously 232 by former Trojan Lodrick Stewart) increasing his total to 234 made. Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
However, USC would not allow itself to be the victim of a hoops horror story Wednesday night as the Trojans pulled away with a late rally to defeat Colorado on the road, 75-64. 
USC used a 12-7 run early in the second half to jump to a 48-38 advantage on the Buffs with just over 15 minutes remaining in regulation. A dunk from Trojan junior forward Chimezie Metu, who finished with a game-high 21 points (10-of-16 FG), capped off the USC run. 
And, almost on cue, the Trojans would proceed to go on a three-and-a-half minute scoring drought that saw Colorado capitalize with a 14-2 run, giving them the lead. A pair of free throws from Colorado’s junior guard Namon Wright gave the Buffs a 52-50 lead over the Trojans with 12:27 remaining in regulation. 
In the following four minutes, the teams went back-and-forth, trading leads until a 3-pointer from Buffs’ senior guard Dominique Collier knotted the contest at 58 with 8:30 remaining in play. 
Over the next seven minutes, USC (20-9 overall, 11-5 in Pac-12) went on a 12-0 run that would ultimately put the victory on ice. A free throw from Trojan senior guard Elijah Stewart gave USC a 70-58 lead with 1:11 remaining in regulation. Colorado shot a combined 0-for-5 during the Trojans’ game-winning run near the end of regulation. 
A 3-pointer from USC senior guard Jordan McLaughlin gave the Trojans a 69-58 lead with 3:13 left in play. McLaughlin finished Wednesday night’s contest with 18 points (6-of-10 FG) and a game-high seven assists. 
Metu tallied 14 points (7-of-11 FG) in the second half, scoring many of his baskets during USC’s crucial runs late in regulation. A layup from Metu with just over five minutes to play in regulation gave USC a 66-58 advantage. 
Wednesday night’s contest against Colorado (15-13, 7-9) was USC’s first game since the season-long departure of junior forward Bennie Boatwright due to a knee injury was made official. The contest against the Buffs also came just hours after the announcement that USC sophomore forward De’Anthony Melton would be withdrawing from the University. 
Stewart rewrote the USC basketball history books against Colorado Wednesday. A 3-pointer from the senior guard four minutes into the second half gave Stewart the 233rd 3-point field goal of his USC career. Stewart set the record for career 3-point field goals by a Trojan, which was formerly held by Rodrick Stewart (232). 
The record-setting 3-pointer from Stewart gave USC a 48-38 lead with 16:00 left in play. 
Overall, the Trojans mounted a strong offensive effort against Colorado. USC finished the game shooting 29-for-53 (55 percent) from the floor. From beyond the arc, the Trojans put together a 10-for-20 (50 percent) shooting effort. 
Leading the way for Colorado on Wednesday was sophomore forward Lucas Siewart, who finished with 16 points on 6-of-11 shooting. A 3-pointer from Siewart with just under 13 minutes left in play tied the game at 50 apiece. 
USC picked up its largest lead of the game on its final shot attempt of the night. A 3-point field goal from redshirt junior guard Shaqquan Aaron put the Trojans ahead 75-62 with 15 seconds left in regulation. 
Despite being out-rebounded (32-26) and out-assisted (15-13) by Colorado, USC came away with the victory. The Trojans did, however, outscore the Buffs in the paint, 32-22. 
USC underwent an offensive surge late in the first half that saw it hit eight consecutive field goal attempts in what was a 16-8 run for the team. A dunk from USC freshman forward Jordan Usher capped the run and gave the Trojans a 36-29 lead with under two minutes left in the first half. 
Leading the Trojans in rebounding was sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic, who finished with six boards and 5 points (2-of-4 FG) scored Wednesday. 
The victory moves USC into sole possession of second place in the Pac-12 standings. The Trojans are just a game-and-a-half behind conference-leading Arizona (21-6, 11-3). 
Following the win, USC will stay on the road to take on Utah (17-9, 9-6) on Saturday. The Trojans defeated the Utes, 84-67, at the Galen Center on Jan. 14, a win that snapped USC’s then eight-game losing streak to Utah. 
Offensively, the Utes will enter Thursday’s contest with four players averaging double-digits in scoring. Senior guard Justin Bibbins is Utah’s go-to option on offense, averaging 14.2 PPG this season. 
USC has now swept Colorado in the season series; the Trojans defeated Colorado at the Galen Center on Jan. 10, 70-58. The Trojans now have a four-game winning streak against the Buffs. 
The victory clinches USC’s third-straight 20-win season under head coach Andy Enfield. The last — and only — time USC has achieved three-straight 20-win seasons was from 2007-2009 under head coach Tim Floyd. 
The Trojans will look to make program history on Saturday; USC has never swept Colorado and Utah in the same season.

The USC men’s volleyball team lost a heartbreaking match to No. 10 Pepperdine last Saturday evening.
Photo by Ling Luo | Daily Trojan
After an embarrassing 0-3 loss to No. 2 crosstown rival UCLA, USC traveled to nearby Malibu to take on another Southern California team — Pepperdine University. The Waves boast a very impressive resume with an overall record of 7-3, including wins over ranked teams such as No. 4 UC Irvine and No. 14 Ball State. The Waves’ upset over the Anteaters prepared the team heading into their match against the Trojans. 
Pepperdine played a near flawless game against Irvine, firing 13 aces and out-blocking Irvine 8-7.5. Pepperdine’s trio of outside hitters, junior David Wieczorek, senior Alex Harthaller and senior Colby Harriman, led the team. Wieczorek recorded a team-high 19 kills and three aces. Harthaller had 13 kills and three aces, while Harriman contributed with 10 kills and three aces. Junior middle blocker Max Chamberlain also had three aces of his own. 
Against USC, Pepperdine’s same outside hitter triplet proved to be the difference. Wieczorek continued his remarkable hitting, slashing .371 with 18 kills and six digs. Harriman had 16 kills and five aces, and Harthaller went off for 10 kills, nine digs and four blocks. Chamberlain somewhat quietly had seven kills and six blocks while hitting .636. Sophomore outside hitter Noah Dyer and freshman Robert Mullahey each recorded four blocks and tallied 10 and eight digs, respectively. 
USC was led by junior outside hitter Jack Wyett, who had a game-high 20 kills and seven digs. Junior outside hitter Gianluca Grasso was second with nine kills, 10 digs, three blocks and two aces, while junior middle blocker Connor Inglow had six kills and four blocks. Meanwhile, junior outside hitter Ryan Moss had an unusually poor performance with only five kills, two aces and two blocks.
For USC, this season is bordering on disaster. While the ranking committee previously gave them some leeway and took into account their brutal schedule, the Trojans are now completely out of the top 15. With upcoming games against No. 12 Grand Canyon, No. 13 UC Santa Barbara and No. 6 BYU, it doesn’t appear that the Trojans have a clear way out of their losing skid. The only hope is that head coach Jeff Nygaard can inspire his team and possibly make some adjustments to the team’s rotation in hopes of motivating his players. Otherwise, USC’s season may be all but over.

After rising to a No. 3 rank, the women’s water polo team will look to add its third-straight title victory at the Barbara Kalbus Invitation this weekend. The Trojans have won the last two years’ tournaments, which have been hosted by UC Irvine. 
Photo by Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Over three days, the team will have the chance to face four opponents, including top competitors such as No. 1 Stanford, No. 2 Cal and No. 4 UCLA. The tournament is a chance for the top teams in the MPSF and the nation to face off. From year to year, it is a consistently competitive weekend, but this year, the tournament will feature 16 top-20 teams, providing a truly elite lineup of competition.
The weekend for the Trojans will start out with a matchup against San Jose State on Friday. The No. 18 team will provide a solid challenge to begin the weekend, but the team’s eyes will be set on the second game of the tourney. A win over San Jose State would result in a game against the winner of the opening game between No. 6 Arizona State and No. 15 UC San Diego on Saturday. An opportunity to face the Sun Devils this early in the tournament would be a welcome trial for the Trojans, who often duel with them in the MPSF tournament.
A pair of opening victories would give the Trojans a berth into the semifinal game on Saturday night. The ultimate goal of the tournament is to reach the championship game on Sunday, which could set the team against any of its in-state foes. The Trojans already took down the Bruins in a 6-4 victory in the title game of the Triton Invitational two weeks ago. The win gave the Trojans their fifth-straight championship in the tournament, highlighted by two goals from standout freshman driver Paige Hauschild, who scored the final goal to clinch the 2-point advantage. Hauschild went on to win MPSF Newcomer of the Week following her performance in the tournament. The award was her second in only six weeks of NCAA play.
Although the Trojans took home the title thanks to a ferocious offensive effort — with senior captain driver Brianna Daboub notching her 100th career goal in the semifinal victory over UC Irvine — it was the defense that held down the championship for USC. Goalkeepers senior Victoria Chamorro and junior Amanda Longan split time in the net, with Chamorro earning 27 saves on the weekend and Longan picking up 23 in the semifinal and championship match.
A similar defensive effort will be necessary for the Trojans this weekend, as they will most likely face off against two of the top four teams in the nation. The team has yet to face Cal and Stanford so far this season, but all three teams are well-acquainted as they will play each other a handful of times in regular season games and tournaments, as well as in the MPSF and NCAA tournaments. The matchups are not set in stone yet, but the Trojans can expect a challenge no matter which of their in-state rivals they face at the finish line.

Sophomore point guard De’Anthony Melton announced Wednesday morning that he is withdrawing from USC via a statement released on his Twitter account.
The guard announced hischoice to withdraw fromUSC to pursue a pro career. Daily Trojan file photo.
Confirmed by the USC men’s basketball program just an hour later, Melton revealed that he plans on taking a leave of absence from USC to focus on preparing for the upcoming NBA Draft.
“After much thought and consideration, we, as a family, have made the difficult decision for me to withdraw from school,” Melton wrote  on Twitter. “I have reached a crossroads wherein I have decided to focus on honing my strengths and improving upon my weaknesses for competition at the next level.”
The announcement comes just a month after USC suspended Melton for the entirety of the 2017-18 season due to his connection to a bribery case in which former assistant coach Tony Bland was charged.
Shutting down suspicions that he would potentially come back for the 2018-19 season, the former California state champion is expected to take this off-season to return to his alma mater Crespi Carmelite to train and develop his skills. 
The USC men’s basketball team tweeted just 40 minutes after Melton’s announcement, “#FightOn, @DeAnthonyMelton! Melton is projected as an NBA first round pick after leading the Pac-12 in steals as a freshman. #USCtotheNBA.”
As an integral part of head coach Andy Enfield’s 2016-17 tournament team, Melton provided USC with a Swiss army knife skill set that propelled the Trojans to their first 26-win season in program history and first trip to the round of 32 since 2008.
While Melton impressed with 8.3 points, 3.5 assists and 4.7 rebounds a game for USC as a freshman, it was his Pac-12-leading 69 steals and 6-foot-8 wingspan that drew the NBA’s attention. 
Melton’s 6-foot-4, 200-pound frame allowed the point guard to play alongside senior point guard Jordan McLaughlin as Melton’s defensive capabilities and offensive playmaking allowed players like McLaughlin or even senior guard Elijah Stewart to score baskets at will. 
With Melton out for the entire season, McLaughlin and sophomore guard Jonah Mathews now carry the brunt of the passing duties as McLaughlin ranks fourth in the nation in assists per game (7.7). 
Along with losing McLaughlin and Stewart to graduation, USC could potentially lose junior forward Chimezie Metu who has been gaining NBA looks ever since his freshman year. 
Metu is a staunch advocate of the #FREEDMELT movement but there is no indication whether Metu will join Melton and leave school early to play professional basketball. 
Although USC has lost an invaluable offensive and defensive piece in Melton, it will now have an extra scholarship to offer for the 2018-19 season and could potentially land another recruit from a loaded 2018 class or even a transfer from another D-I program. 
Even if the Trojans save the scholarship for 2019 recruits, incoming four-star commits Elijah Weaver and Kevin Porter will both be playing big roles next season for a USC team that has already seen freshman guard Jordan Usher blossom. 
Barring transfers, USC will still have McDonald’s All-American Chuck O’Bannon, Jr. and even three-star big man Victor Oyaelunmo to work with in the upcoming year.

The great thing about sports is that the best moments come when you least expect them. Nowhere is that notion more apparent than the Olympics, where there are thousands of athletes, most of whom are relatively unknown and competing in niche sports. This is where historic moments become legendary — not because of the starpower of the athletes, but because the moment was so powerful that it quite simply cannot be forgotten.
The Winter Games in PyeongChang, South Korea have produced a few of these moments thus far, but two of them will be etched in stone forever: Last Saturday, when a snowboarder won a gold medal in a skiing event, and Wednesday, when the United States women claimed gold in cross-country skiing for the first time in history, pulling off an incredible upset in a stacked field of winter sports giants.
These moments were neither scripted nor predicted. The athletes were not hyped up to be gold medal favorites, like household names Shaun White and Mikaela Shiffrin. Nobody outside of people in their respective sports knew who they were before they competed. But by the time they crossed the finish line, Ester Ledecka, Jessie Diggins and Kikkan Randall would soon become household names themselves.
Ledecka is a snowboarder from the Czech Republic, and her story is one straight out of a movie. She entered the super-G, an alpine skiing event, and reportedly borrowed someone else’s skis to compete. Let me reiterate: This was a snowboarder, competing in a skiing event — in the Olympics, no less.
Ledecka was the 26th racer to go down the course, so by the time her turn came, the winner had all but been decided. On the world stage, the commentator had essentially declared Austria’s Anna Veith — the defending champion in the event — the winner, “barring something exceptional.” 
Well, the exceptional happened. At the first speed marker, she was 0.03 seconds back of Veith. But she was cruising, hitting the right speeds, taking the perfect angles. By the time she hit the third marker — between which the camera repeatedly showed Veith hugging her family, celebrating the presumed gold — Ledecka was in the lead by 0.04 seconds. And as she sped down the home stretch and touched the line, her time flashed on the screen: She had won, by a hundredth of a second. 
Ledecka’s reaction was priceless, because she didn’t have one. She stared straight ahead, speechless, so stunned that the cameraman had to tell her that she had won.
“No,” she said. “Must be some mistake.” 
There was no mistake. She entered the field as a massive underdog and came out of it an Olympic champion skier. 
We all love these David vs. Goliath stories, which is why Americans will love what Diggins and Randall did at the women’s team sprint freestyle race. 
Before Wednesday, no American female cross country skier had claimed a medal. No American — period — had ever won gold, and the last medal went to Bill Koch in 1976.
The odds were stacked against them to end the 42-year drought. They were up against countries like Norway and Sweden, which pump out gold medalists in the Winter Olympics like clockwork. The United States, historically, has not stood a chance at this event.
But Diggins and Randall had the race of their lives in a relay event that is as hard to watch as it is to compete in. The terrain is nasty, the hills are steep and it is freezing cold. Yet, as the competitors reached the home stretch up the final hill, Diggins was in third, close behind Sweden and Norway. Hills are Diggins’ speciality, and she made her move into second before battling Sweden’s Stina Nilsson in an all-out sprint, winning by 0.19 seconds.
Diggins, who placed fifth and sixth, respectively, in her first two events, screamed in joy for a brief second before collapsing in the snow out of exhaustion. Randall, a five-time Olympian competing in her final Games, waited at the finish line and dove on top of Diggins in an embrace. Together, they got up, each with “USA” glittered on their faces, grabbed a big American flag and flashed the widest grins you will ever see.
These are the moments that make the Olympics great. We love to watch the so-called favorites. We tune in to see Nathan Chen skate or Chloe Kim snowboard. We’ll be watching when the  gold medal hockey game takes place on the final day of competition on Sunday. But, in the name of the Olympic spirit, let’s recognize the stories that pop up in between, the stories that bring out what we love most about sports.

When Tucker Rayl, a junior majoring in acting, first envisioned the concept behind his play, Reality Star, he didn’t think anything would come of it. 
School of Dramatic Arts junior Tucker Rayl’s (middle) play, inspired by the Kardashians and celebrity culture, draws attention to the good, the bad and the ugly behind the reality TV industry. Photos courtesy of Tucker Rayl.
“I started out writing loose sketches in high school, and when I got to USC I took a screenwriting class, which was when I first got the idea,” Rayl said. “I went through five or six drafts before I even showed it to anyone.”
But for the past few months, Rayl has stepped into the shoes of a director, working with a producer and a group of actors to bring Reality Star to the stage. 
“It’s been a matter of looking at what I wrote and thinking ‘how do I bring this to real life?’” Rayl said. “All the actors bring so much to my writing that I didn’t even think about.” 
Reality Star is a 60-minute play that follows Simone Sultana, portrayed by Amanda Cook, a famous reality television star whose face, her main source of income, is wrecked in a car accident. Sultana’s “momager” then decides to hide her face with a golden mask to preserve her image and the family brand. Rayl drew much of his inspiration for the play from following social media giants such as the Kardashians. 
“It’s a satire based on those ‘famous-for-being-famous’ reality TV families,” Rayl said. “I’m kind of obsessed with the Kardashians. It’s such an odd relationship we all have with them.”
Rayl also cites artist Andy Warhol as a major influence of his play. Warhol’s exploration of celebrity culture and the effects, both positive and negative, of fame on society is very similar to the themes Rayl touches upon in Reality Star. 
“I’ve been obsessed with Warhol for years,” Rayl said. “He triggered a whole study and cultural consciousness about the different aspects of fame, which we all have a relationship with, as much as we might not want to admit it.” 
Despite his major’s acting emphasis, Rayl only appears in his own play for a brief moment, inserting himself into a tiny cameo. His reason for limiting his time on camera was that he didn’t want to juggle multiple responsibilities and overwhelm himself. 
“It’s weird to have these two roles where one is the higher up to the other and I’m in both of those roles,” Rayl said. “That didn’t make sense to me. It’s my first time really directing a show so I didn’t want to have to focus on both. That’d be too much to take on.”
Rayl believes that his directorial experience has been an asset to his acting, allowing him to understand both sides of the equation: what directors want from actors and vice versa, and how the two can work together to achieve a shared objective. 
“I think they go hand in hand,” Rayl said. “I’m able to have two different frames of mind about it. When I’m acting in classes it feels a little easier knowing what is going on in the director’s head. It’s helpful to have both under my belt.”
For Rayl, the experience of being in the theater, whether in the spotlight or in the audience, is more personal and intimate than other media such as film. 
“In theater there’s such a one- on-one relationship between the performer and the audience,” Rayl said. “They react off you and that feeds into your performance. I think there’s something magical about that.” 
Reality Star will run from Feb. 23 to 25 at the Flight Theatre at the Complex Hollywood. Tickets are $10 online and $15 at the door.

Ever since opening its doors for the first time in 2008, the GRAMMY Museum in L.A. Live has become integral to downtown Los Angeles’ culture. When the partnership between Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) and the Recording Academy was initially searching for a location for the museum, GRAMMY Museum Executive Director Scott Goldman said that the then-new L.A. Live venue quickly became the only rational option, as AEG was not only financing the museum, but also in charge of building the downtown sector into what it is today.
On display until March, the X: 40 Years of Punk in Los Angeles exhibit highlights the contributions of X, a Los Angeles punk rock band that formed in 1977. Photo from Facebook.
“As [AEG] was planning and building L.A. Live, it only made sense for us to put the GRAMMY Museum here, in the midst of what they were creating as an entertainment district,” Goldman said. 
Since the museum’s inception, a parade of exhibits and one-of-a-kind memorabilia have kept its halls fresh with new material. One of the museum’s current exhibits is X: 40 Years of Punk in Los Angeles, which first opened in October 2017 and honors how X’s original four members helped set the tone for the city’s flourishing punk scene. On display until March, the exhibit has been a popular section of the museum, attracting visitors who are curious about the band and its impact.
For museum-goer Lourdes Takeda, the collection gave her a chance to learn more about X lead singer Exene Cervenka.
 “I really enjoyed the interview with Exene that was upstairs,” she said.  “I learned things that I didn’t know about her and also members of the band, and their Los Angeles history.”
Her husband, Dwayne Takeda, was equally impressed with the exhibit, but said the display of Resonator Guitars was his favorite part of the museum.
“We came to see the X exhibit, but I was really fascinated by the exhibit on the Resonator guitars,” he said after touring the facility. “It’s an instrument that a lot of people have seen, but they just think it’s a regular guitar. It’s the old ones made out of metal, they’re very loud, and they had a video on how you make them … I thought that was very interesting.”
The interactive studio and recording booth are permanent, unlike some of the rotating exhibits, and are especially popular among the museum’s younger visitors. For Isabella Joaquin, who visited the museum with Sky Academy, an initiative designed to give underserved youth of L.A. increased exposure to the arts, the opportunity to play the instruments was incredibly valuable.
“I played the drums, you can play songs on it, and you could switch the music,” she said. “It was interesting, and very impressive. There was a lot of high tech stuff, it was pretty cool.”
There’s a lot to be seen inside the GRAMMY Museum, and for Goldman, that’s exactly the point. For visitors who stop by as they make their way through L.A. Live, Goldman hopes they leave the compound with a better understanding of the power of music in all of its forms.
“Right now if you were to walk through the halls, you would see exhibits on a great Latin artist, a great jazz artist, a country artist, as well as a remarkable display of guitars built in the 1920s,” he said. “We tell many stories about the power of music.”
The museum often invites notable figures in the industry to share their stories or perform live music for visitors, and Thursday evening, author and journalist Gerrick Kennedy will make an appearance to discuss his book Parental Discretion is Advised. The book timelines the improbable story of N.W.A. as told through interviews with Ice Cube and several other figures linked to the landmark music group, and Kennedy looks forward to expanding upon his work during an intimate conversation at the GRAMMY Museum.
“The GRAMMY Museum is a rare institution in L.A. that fosters music education while preserving and celebrating the culture from a myriad of genres,” Kennedy said. “I’m really honored that they are hosting me to discuss West Coast hip-hop and N.W.A — a group that defined the genre — during a time when rap is informing all facets of pop culture. It’s essential that music institutions, such as the Recording Academy and the GRAMMY Museum acknowledge and embrace that.”

In the event that my house goes up in flames, the three items I will refuse to leave behind: include my phone, my Adidas sneakers and my letterbox — in that order.
The first is so I can make the necessary emergency calls in the wake of the tragedy and figure out my next move. The second, because they’re the only pair of shoes I ever wear, no matter how formal an event may be. However, the last item is by far the most important to me, despite how hard it would be to lug out of the burning building. A cherry- red shoebox with golden accents, it once belonged to a Starbucks travel mug but now houses eight years worth of handwritten letters. My collection includes birthday cards from my aunts written in almost illegible scrawls; awkward confessional letters from equally awkward boys; postcards my friends sent from Europe; and funny pencil drawings, as well as Christmas gift tags and refrigerator Post-Its with Bible verses my mom lovingly leaves on my Tupperware containers. Every note that I’ve ever received goes in the shoebox, filling it to the brim with words of encouragement, sorrow, trinkets bearing great sentimental value and more.
As a child, I’d rush to the mailbox every day in the hopes of seeing if I was fortunate enough to find something, anything addressed to me, as I had pen pals a few cities over and others in distant countries. My earliest memory of receiving letters was from the tooth fairy, Flossie, who took my teeth in exchange for a dollar and a Hallmark card. Those were truly momentous occasions.
Letters became the backbone of my existence. Between battling bouts of depression in high school, I coped through letter- writing, telling friends what I saw and admired in them. I even wrote to people I didn’t know well, spilling my heart out and neatly pressing my emotions within my signature folded envelope. I’d scribble the name of the recipient in calligraphy and slip it inside lockers, between closed textbooks and into backpacks. As you may have understood from my previous columns, writing is essential to my wellbeing — in the same way that writing an article for my high school newspaper and blasting it out to the entire student body was a way of connecting to others, composing these letters became a more intimate form of mass communication.

For me, letter writing was the safest risk. I was able to tell someone how I truly felt, while also letting them read and interpret it at their leisure. As a result, I seldom received responses — probably because people were so taken aback by the strange formality of it all or because I was a stranger to them — but that didn’t matter to me. What really counted was that I was able to put myself out there. 
In retrospect, it was a weird, desperate attempt to get through to people and share tidbits of my heart with them, even if they weren’t interested. I never held back in these letters, and in my immaturity I think I burdened people by brain dumping my issues in an unwarranted manner. I felt painfully misunderstood, which was the combined product of teenage angst and a deeply cynical worldview that prevented me from fully connecting with my peers. Any time I tried to speak, I’d fumble with my words and turn bright red, punctuating my speech with strange mannerisms. Through my writing, I was able to push aside the first few hurdles of warming up to someone and allowed my words to make a first impression for me.
Nowadays I turn to my phone to stay in contact with my friends out of convenience. Occasionally I send emails because I’m too cheap to pay for postage and ask people for their college P.O. boxes, but regardless, my messages still hold the same sentiments true. In a way, all my writing echoes the collection of love letters I hold close to my heart, no matter what form I choose to convey it in. Whether it’s a letter, a text, this column or even a news article, I hope to form a connection that resonates with the people who read what I have to say.
