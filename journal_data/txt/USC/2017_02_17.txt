The only way for feminism to prevail is to have cooperation on both sides — because ultimately, men and women are forced to coexist either way. Therefore, we might as well try our best to get to know each other even though we’ll never really know what it’s like to be each other. Having  respect for someone else does not require empathy, but unfortunately this is not the case for many men who have baseless presumptions about the modern-day female plight. 
Women’s rights have undoubtedly come a long way, and the nations that have been relatively open about promoting the cause and include female-friendly policies tend to be more developed and have a higher GDP. This translates into a micro-sense as well — a man that supports female rights will likely be more successful overall. Self-assurance is the key to accepting the fact that there are people “better” than we are, whether it be a man or woman. But since the latter is traditionally seen as weaker, the most pathetic men try to uphold the stereotype so they won’t be at the bottom of the human race in general. It’s unfortunate that men are discouraged from exploring their feelings and consequently lack emotional intelligence, because having sufficient E.Q. to confront our own faults is the first step to supporting others. 
We also have a derogatory perception of women in relationships based off of mainstream romantic movies. Too often a male lead sweeps the girl off of her feet, and it’s implied that the pair can’t live without each other. The main discrepancy here is that the man is doing the work while the woman basically waits for him to come into her life. In other words, she can’t live without him. One of the greatest filmmakers of all time, Hayao Miyazaki, deliberately counters this trend in his works by often establishing a female lead and a male co-lead, who both genuinely need one another in their lives to exist. For example, in the 2001 award-winning film Spirited Away, the main character Chihiro is saved by the co-main character Haku in her early childhood, but the reverse happens when they are much older. They also grow as individuals throughout the film based off of their time together. That is real romance.
We as men will never understand the opposite gender-specific struggle and vice versa. But women in general have a far-better grasp of what men are thinking than the other way around. The reason is because they’re taught to not be as outspoken, and consequently have honed their listening and observation skills to a tee. I remember when I first joined the military back in fall and thought the girls had an easier time getting roasted or being punished until I realized they simply received orders far better than we did. This applies to life as well, and women make educated and fairly accurate guesses as to the reasons behind our actions. Therefore, they can preemptively do things for us we didn’t even realize we wanted to get done ourselves. We need to reciprocate. 
Feminism is not that hard to get behind in theory, but the too-often fragile male ego makes it so. Emotional intelligence has been taken for granted in the past, with the ancient world focusing on physical superiority and the ability to produce income to ultimately populate the earth, overshadowing the male’s ability to connect with his emotions. But we’re moving ever so closely to a modern society, and the only way to solidify this transition is with the unanimous support of over 3 billion other people in the world. 
My feelings for women have never changed, I respect them , but my feelings for feminism has changed. Feminism is a hate group now.

Photo from Tips to Organize
It’s midterm season, which means it is time to get organized. I’m not just talking about sorting your class notes that you scribbled in random notebooks — being organized this semester is more than just schoolwork. Since we are midway through the semester, it is important to reevaluate different aspects of your life and improve organizational skills to help you get through the next few months. Here are a few tips to stay on track this semester:
Start your day organized.
I have to give my roommate credit for this first tip. Admittedly, my side of the room can get a little messy (my roommate can attest to this). However, she often reminds me of the importance of starting each morning by making my bed. This small organizational tool not only helps make your room look clean, but also starts your day off feeling organized. 
Use your phone to your advantage.
Setting reminders on your phone and using your iCal will definitely keep your life in check. You’ll never forget what you need to do throughout the day by setting a reminder. Furthermore, our days are extremely busy at school, so using your calendar on your phone will make sure you can schedule in time for yourself, whether it is a quick workout, nap or a lunch with a friend.
Keep track of your fitness schedule.
Having a steady workout schedule can be hard to manage in our everyday lives. In order to stay on track of your health this semester, it is important to make fitness goals. Whether it is working out at the gym or taking a group class, find times to work out that fit in your schedule and commit to a fitness routine. An easy solution to keep track of your fitness is to use the health app on an iPhone. This app measures how many miles you walk each day. Setting a goal for how far you will walk in a day adds structure to your schedule.
Don’t forget about your fruits and vegetables.
It is not only important to organize your physical health, but it is also crucial to maintain healthy eating habits. To stay on top of this, make sure to incorporate healthy foods in your meals. Prepare vegetables as snacks to eat between classes, buy some fruit at the campus farmer’s market or swap out a side for a salad in order to have balance in food groups throughout the day. 
Organize your personal well-being.
While it is important to organize your room, schedule and health, it is also crucial to stay on top of your personal well-being. In order to organize your semester, take time every Sunday to map out your week so you know what you have to do and what you want to accomplish. Balancing your school work, social life and personal well-being will ensure a successful semester.

With only four games left in conference play, the women’s basketball team looks to add two more victories in its last home games of the season. After last week’s upset over the previously No. 9 Oregon State, the Trojans are ready to head into this week and take on the challenge of Washington State on Friday at 6 p.m. and No. 9 Washington on Sunday at 3 p.m.
“Getting a win over Oregon State was really big for us,” senior guard Courtney Jaco said. “Not only are they top 10 in the country, but they are tied for first in the conference, so that was a really big confidence booster for us. I think we are heading into this weekend with a lot of positive thoughts. We think we can compete with anybody with that win.”
In addition to their confidence, USC will also have the home court advantage this time around. After losing to both Washington State and Washington on the road, they not only want to protect their home court, but also fix their mistakes from the last games and come away with two big wins. Home game or not, the games will be tough for the Trojans, but their focus and determination is the same it has been every game prior.
“We think that we can beat Washington State,” Jaco said. “Playing them here should give us a little more confidence in front of our home crowd, our fans, our friends and family. I think our approach should be the same in that they are a good team, and we have to take it seriously and come out with our best effort.”
Both teams are strong offensively, especially Washington, and have been putting up big final scores against their opponents. This not only calls on USC to have the defense to contain them, but also for their offense to be able to score and force the other teams to scramble to catch up. The Trojans are looking to shut down their opponents’ strongest areas, while playing their game to the best of their ability.
“For Washington State, stopping their transition [is key],” Jaco said. “They really get out and run hard, so that definitely has to be a focus. For Washington, Kelsey Plum and Chantel Osahor are both two of the best players in the country right now. We have to find a way to limit them as much as we can and hopefully we get the score a little further down because they put it up.”
Before the battle with Washington commences on Sunday, USC will be honoring its four seniors, three of whom ( Jaco, Alexis Lloyd and Jordan Adams) were on the Trojans’ first team to win a Pac-12 Championship in 2014. Besides Adams, who hopes she will be given another year of eligibility after being sidelined with a season-ending ACL injury in preseason, the other members of the team are looking forward to their future beyond USC 
“I haven’t really gotten too emotional about it yet, or tried not to at least,” Jaco said. “But these four years have quickly flown by. I am just excited and ready to celebrate it with my teammates and I think it will be a lot of fun.”

The No. 9 men’s tennis team will be leaving the friendly confines of Marks Stadium and heading out to Charlottesville, Va. this weekend to compete in the ITA Division I National Indoor Championships. 
Sixteen of the top Division I teams will meet in Virginia across the next four days all vying for the coveted ITA Indoor National Championship. The championship itself dates back to 1973 and has been held every year since.
Fifteen teams qualified for this event at the 2017 ITA Kick-Off Weekend four-team regional. USC secured its bid in October during the Southwest Regional Championships held in Malibu. Meanwhile Virginia received an automatic bid for hosting. 
Last year, No. 5 North Carolina topped hosting school and No. 1 Virginia in 2016 and looks to repeat the magic again. Other competing schools include No. 3 Ohio State, No. 4 Cal, crosstown rival No. 8 UCLA and No. 2 Wake Forest, which boasts ITA No. 1 ranked players in both singles and doubles.
Also making appearances are both No. 12 Georgia and No. 7 Florida. USC suffered its first and only loss of the season against Florida only to upset then-No. 5 Georgia during the annual Pac-12/SEC challenge. Whether USC will play these two SEC powerhouses remains to be seen. Each team is guaranteed at minimum three matches and a repeat of the challenge may very well be in store for the Trojans.
At last year’s tournament USC achieved less than favorable results. After a strong showing on the opening day against South Florida by way of a 4-3 victory, the Trojans suffered consecutive losses to TCU in the quarterfinals and to Wake Forest in the consolation matchup.
Boasting three doubles pairings in the ITA Top 50 including freshmen Brandon Holt and Riley Smith as well as a singles top 15 ranking by way of Holt, the Trojans hope to continue their midseason surge when they open against rival UCLA on Friday at 6:30 p.m. EST.
