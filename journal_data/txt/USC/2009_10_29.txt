The USC men’s basketball team was picked to finish second-to-last in the conference at Pac-10 media day Thursday.
After a tumultuous offseason that included the resignation of coach Tim Floyd and the early departure of the majority of the team’s experienced players, questions are swirling around the USC program. As the media sees it, new coach Kevin O’Neill and the Trojans will have a rough time in the Pac-10.
USC was picked to finish in front of only Stanford in the preseason standings. Cal was picked to win the conference, receiving 25 first-place votes, followed by Washington (seven first-place votes) and UCLA (five first-place votes). Arizona is predicted to finish fourth, followed by Oregon State, Oregon, Arizona State and Washington State.
The Trojans begin their season at home on Nov. 17 against UC Riverside.

The National Cancer Institute awarded a $16 million research grant to USC on Monday to bring a new perspective to the study of an old disease: cancer.
USC is one of 12 schools that received grant money from the NCI to set up a research program that utilizes the skills of both biological and physical sciences. The grant will help establish an NCI Physical Sciences-Oncology Center based at USC.
“The goal for these centers is to broadly bring perspective to the study of cancer,” said Dr. Parag Mallick, assistant professor of research at the Keck School of Medicine.
The five-year award is the first major push to apply skills that mathematicians and physicists have long been using in their fields to cancer research. USC’s research team will focus on creating a realistic, multi-scale cancer modeling system, which could be used to predict the effectiveness of various treatments.
“Can we identify what treatment option will work? And can we personalize our treatment?” Mallick said.
The new approach looks at cancer as a disease affecting particular body systems, rather than a problem of individual cancer cells.
Much of the research in the last 50 years has been focused on understanding the cancer cell rather than controlling the disease, Mallick said.
“This is a new wave approach to cancer,” Agus said. “A new way with new people.”
The program relies heavily on the modeling and data-gathering techniques developed by physical scientists who have long been using such tools to model climate systems and astronomical bodies.
The virtual models will recreate cancer from a molecular scale all the way up to the cancer tumors affecting the host.
The NCI formally announced the grant application process January of this year, but rumors had been circulating up to a year ago, according to officials.
Several USC doctors attended workshops before the formal announcement and were contacted about the opportunity.
“We wanted people who came from physical sciences to look at cancer in the way that they were trained in,” said Larry Nagahara, NCI PS-OC program director.
The deans and provosts of both the biological and physical science departments, as well as  USC’s Washington, DC Office for Research Advancement, helped set up a network of scientists across the nation to aid the project, according to Mallick. The center now consists of 20 investigators, led by USC doctors.
“We can bring top researchers from across the country to share their perspective, and [we plan] to have joint seminars … and videocast simultaneously at both campuses,” Mallick said.
The USC center, named Multiscale Complex Systems Transdisciplinary Analysis of Response to Therapy —
or MC-START — will be housed in the current Clinical Sciences Center on USC’s Health Sciences Campus.
The researchers plan to use the center’s educational and outreach resources to involve USC students in the work.
“We want to train the next generation of students to mix their skills … and not just medical students,” said Dr. David Agus, senior co-investigator on the grant and director of the USC Westside Prostate Cancer Center.
Eventually the team hopes these models will be used to develop new and innovative cancer treatments, which not only battle the disease on a cellular level, but also on a system-wide level.
“I’m always a believer in mixing people from different arenas,” Agus said. “The death rate of cancer has not changed from 1950 until now. We need to take a dramatically different approach.”

The Los Angeles man found guilty of the second-degree murder of USC student Bryan Frost was sentenced to 16 years to life in prison Thursday.
Travion Ford, 25, was convicted on Aug. 31 for fatally stabbing Frost, a 23-year-old cinema student, on Sept. 18 of last year.
The sentence came after an hour and a half-long hearing, which gave Frost’s friends and family a chance to speak before Ford made a brief statement.
“It was an emotional time for everyone,” said Deputy District Attorney Kennes Ma.
In his statement, Ford maintained that he only stabbed Frost to protect himself.
“He apologized to a certain degree, but what he continues to say is he’s not a murderer. He basically denies the jury’s decision,” Ma said.
The Sept. 18 altercation that led to Frost’s death began after Frost slammed shut an apartment complex gate as he was walking home from the 901 Bar & Grill with friends in the early morning.
Ford and Frost got into a verbal argument first, then began to throw punches and wrestle on the ground.
At one point, Ma told the jury during the trial, Frost pinned Ford to the ground and then got up to walk away. Ford then ran inside his mother’s apartment to grab a knife, which he used to stab Frost.
Ford’s attorney, Diane Butko, argued during the trial that Ford never went back into the apartment, and only stabbed Frost because he feared for his life.
Butko filed an appeal in the case, saying the trial judge excluded important evidence about Frost’s history of drinking, but Ma said the appeal was denied Thursday, and Frost’s family said he did not have any sort of drinking problem.
Ma said Judge George G. Lomeli did not have a lot of say in the sentencing and made no statement.
“This is what we expected,” Ma said.
The judge sentenced Ford to an extra year in prison for wielding a knife. In addition to the prison sentence, the judge ordered Ford to pay about $35,000 in restitution.
Travion Ford had no right to stab Bryan Frost. They may have gotten into a fight ,but in the article it says Frost got up and walked away so that should have made Ford realize the fight weas over. Sadly Ford really wanted to end the fight and took Frost’s life. Too bad Ford couldn’t just move on from the fight. The fact they were fist fighting make the thought of just thinking about stabbing someone is outrageous. Well, at least now he is doing the time for what he did and i hope he does realize now that he is responsible for his actions.
A terrible tragedy with no winners…Mr Ford should have never brought the knife into the altercation, unless Mr Frost had chased him into the house, which he did not!! Bringing a knife to a fist-fight is NOT self-defense…

Balancing the scales · Elisabeth Gustafson and Elias Kohn listen intently during a meeting of the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation. -Alejandra Vargas-Johnson | Daily Trojan
The Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation plans to meet with USC officials next week to encourage the school to join an independent labor rights monitoring organization, in an effort to ensure the university works with socially responsible companies.
SCALE has previously tried to stop USC from working with Russell Athletic, a supplier of clothing at the Pertusati Bookstore. SCALE claims the company exploited about 1,800 workers who were fired from a factory in Honduras last year.
The coalition says Russell Athletic closed down the factory and blacklisted its workers to prevent them from informing others about the work conditions. It was an effort to prevent unionization, according to Elias Kohn, a member of SCALE and a sophomore majoring in sociology.
“Last year, there was a lot of debate about whether the factory closed down for economic reasons or as a policy to discourage unionization,” Kohn said. “Now it’s fairly undebated that discouraging unionization played at least a significant role in Russell’s action.”
Representatives of Russell Athletic have denied the allegations. The company says it  closed the factory mainly for business reasons and because of the economic downturn.
SCALE now says it will settle for a goal the group has long held: getting the school to join the Worker Rights Consortium, a global watchdog for labor rights that ensures companies like Russell Athletic have clean records.
USC is already a member of the Fair Labor Association, an organization of universities, colleges and companies that works to improve working conditions in factories around the world. The FLA is currently conducting its own evaluation of Russell Athletic’s labor practices.
“What the FLA offers is, it does bring all the stakeholders to the table,” said Matt Curran, director of licensing and social responsibility at USC. “The FLA is doing a pretty thorough investigation of what went on in Honduras with the Russell factory closure.”
The FLA’s report was originally expected to be published Thursday, but the labor association has given the company another 45 days, in addition to the 90 days it already received, to explain and provide evidence about the causes for the layoffs and the factory’s closure.
“They’re still in the process of negotiation,” Curran said. “It sounds like positive progress is being made and they don’t want to interrupt that process.”
SCALE, however, believes the FLA’s delay is because the organization’s policies are not as the WRC’s. Its sponsors might dictate what to pursue, which could lead to some issues being overlooked, Kohn said.
“[FLA is] not adequate because it’s self-policed,” Kohn said. “Corporations play a role in some of their procedures … WRC gets money from grants and clothing sales.”
The report’s postponement means November’s meeting between SCALE and the administration will include a discussion about the WRC open to USC, with members from the coalition hoping to push the university about joining WRC.
“The fact that they put them off by 45 days will probably be discussed,” Kohn said. “I just don’t see WRC putting people on multiple remediation plans.”
Although the administration wants to have a constructive dialogue with SCALE, Curran said it would not decide until the FLA report is published.
“I think all options are still on the table,” he said. “It really depends on the results of this investigation.”
In the past, SCALE has protested  by locking themselves in the president’s office or taking other extreme measures. But this year, the group intents to take a more collaborative approach.
“[We want to] find an issue that we can work together on. We hope we have the same long-term goals to help the workers,” Kohn said.
But other members of the coalition say those past events helped raise awareness about SCALE and encouraged the university to meet with the group.
“Because of those protests we have a certain amount of name recognition and influence around campus,” said Elisabeth Gustafson, a junior majoring in history. “Students on campus trust that we’re going to follow up with action.”
Kohn added that if the FLA report comes out without any blaming Russell Athletic, they would consider alternative actions.
“If we can’t find common ground or the WRC is rejected, our next move is a boycott of the bookstore,” he said. “That won’t really happen because [the administration has]  been really vocal about working together, as we have been.”
Vic, before you protest us we’d love to have a conversation about the issues you bring up. SCALE may be a progressive organization, but we do not support all leftist movements in Latin America. We definitely do not support any group that would kill to make their point about workers’ rights. What happened to your uncle is horrible and we would never want that to happen. We support the Workers Rights Consortium, which has a governing board of university administrators, usas reps, labor rights experts, members of local NGOs that advocate for workers rights. It is not a case of American students intervening in a foreign country. It is a case of students and local activists working together to try to improve the lives of workers. The reason why we feel the need to address an issue that does not take place in our country is that it is the institutions with money and power – such as USC – can use that power to influence companies and effect change. But just so you know, we also try to improve things locally. We are involved in campaigns for fair contracts for USC employees and currently working to increase benefits for the janitorial staff. We believe that we can work for good both locally and internationally – without violence.
When is your next meeting so I can come and protest you guys?   I will bring my Honduran family and friends along with pictures of my Uncle from the local newspaper so you can see what you have caused by your meddling in our country.
What’s with the name-calling?  First of all, SCALE wants nothing to do with Communism and has no association, ideological or otherwise, with Communism.
Wouldn’t it be just as easy for me to call those who oppose international standards of labor rights pro-slavery fascists?  But that completely misses the point and has nothing to do with the situation at hand.
The business motive for moving factory production to poorer countries is that the currency and cost of living is much lower.  US companies can save money by moving production overseas and paying a living wage that is cheaper.  But it becomes a slippery slope once companies start paying foreign workers a wage that supports a lower standard of living than workers in the US would have.
People in support of worker’s rights abroad think that workers, no matter where they live, have a right to a minimum standard of living which is not always respected.
btw, I think SCALE would welcome an anti-SCALE group, it would be great for publicity and probably do wonders for recruitment.
My family is from Honduras.  You wacky kids know nothing of the struggle of my people against communist guerrillas such as the PRTCH and FMLH who kill innocent people in the name of so called workers rights.  My uncle owned a small plastics company near the boarder with Nicaragua.   He was hung from a telephone pole by the PRTCH bastards who received support from the drug cartels and your friends in Nicaragua, Venezuela and Cuba.  I can assure you my uncle was a fair man who allowed his workers to eat their lunch for more than 15 minutes.   Before he was killed, the so called “Union People” came with false claims of the workers being mistreated.  When he refused their demands for bribes, he was killed and the factory was closed.   Now, no one has a job.  We have misguided kids like you to thank for this as you encourage such behavior on the part of these terrorists.  Leave my country alone!  You have many problems in this country you should fix (poverty, racisim, bigotry, BCS etc…) first.
Steve M I was hoping you could explain something to me since I must be missing it. WHy did two female workers from Honduras come to USC in the Spring thanking the Universities and student groups that have helped them in an attempt to re-open the factory and gain protecting from the death threats from Russell?
As they explained a situation you seem to be aware of–mainly their jobs being taken due to their protests over 16 hour work days with a 15 minute lunch break and 1 minute bathroom break (not quite a smoke break at a t-shirt factory Dean) as well as the health situations there friends and co-workers were suffering from they seemed pretty clear that groups like USAS who sponsored their tour and groups such as SCALE are on their side and they asked us to keep working on these measures.
But then again Steve maybe you spoke with some workers from Honduras and they told you differently? That would be hard to believe though since the factory was shut down before any UNiversities started boycotting Russell. And since they are boycotting with the campaign of forcing Russell to re-open  (the demand of the workers at JDH) I think you might have a tough time finding any sense behind your claims and rant.
I wont be posting anything else because all of you seem wacked out and so misinformed on this issue I dont really see any logical discussion following other than your rants about Liz and the housekeeper she doesn’t have (and she actually is not in a sorority either just one more check of things your wrong on) and the che poster that, by the way, I dont have.
We need to setup an anti-SCALE group to stop these nuts from straving any more kids in the third world.   Has everyone forgotten about the students who were murdered by the Iranian goverment in July?   Where is protest for our fellow students killed by their own goverment.  That seems to be far more important issue than some guy who didn’t get a smoke break at the t-shirt factory.
hahahaha I’m not even going to address the absurdity of that last post.  Steve M, it’s clear you’re just grasping at straws by making claims that have no basis in fact and resorting to making fun of Elias’s clothing (not sure what the relevance is of that line).  If you’re going to make a fool of yourself like this I would think you would want to at least maintain some shred of credibility by writing with correct grammar and spelling.  Next time post with your real full name so you can actually take responsibility for your laughable statements.
Look, everyone at the meeting has now posted comments attacking Mr. Starr’s comments.  May I suggest a phone booth for your next meeting.  Elias can bring his Che poster to make the meeting look more important.
I’m with Thite.  You guys are commie pinkos.   You can tell the real communists by their denials.  Elais, it’s obvious by your lumberjack look you are not the one with the guatemalan housekeeper.  I’m sure your friend wears make-up back at the sorority.
Let’s talk about what you fools have apparently done.  How many Honduran’s lost their job by your actions.  How many children are going hungry because their parent’s didn’t bring home a check from the Russell factory.  May I suggest you meet some Hunduran and find out what they want.  They are a proud hardworking people who have little interest in your World Socialism Agenda.  Unlike some of surrounding leftist controlled countries, Honduras has a growing ecomony.
The problem with this article is not the photograph, it’s you.
Commie pinkos, haven’t heard that one in a while.
This isn’t just a leftist campus movement.  On May 13th of this year, 65 congressmen sent a letter to the CEO of the Russell Corporation expressing their “grave concern about severe violations of internationally recognized labor rights.”
I would also like to voice a my grievance at the picture chosen for this article.  Elisabeth has her eyes closed and Elias’ face is hardly visible.  If the DT is going to run an article about an issue affecting the campus and feature two students who are important to a movement concerning that issue, wouldn’t it make sense to actually show who they are?  No qualms with the photographer, I’m sure he/she took other pictures that were much more adequate for printing than this one.
Thite D. Starr i completely agree with you.  We need to put a stop to these leftist USC students who are parading around in black bandanas smashing store windows around campus.  I hope someone can soon determine their hidden motive for campaigning for fair treatment of exploited workers.  I will do my best to obtain photos of both these characters’ faces  when they are secretly wearing their designer clothing in san morino and overworking their guatemalan housekeeper you seem to care about.  We have to halt these commie pinko students in their tracks before they garner so much support for their cause that fair treatment of workers in foreign countries becomes ensured everywhere.
Hey Thite great comment–only because everything you said is wrong I thought Id start off telling you I would gladly show my face they chose the picture, and you are more than welcome to see my face anytime you wanna say anything about my friends and their nonexistent guatemalan housekeeper
In fact every UC school is signed onto the measures we discussed in the article, as are 186 Universities in the US. A little more than just berkeley huh? With regards to Russell 98 Universities have cut their contract. But then again I guess that is all just leftist propaganda anyways
if you knew even a handful of the details about this you would be shocked at how stupid you sound
It is amazing that USC has a few of the last remaining commie pinko students outside of Berkeley.  Notice neither allows their face to be fully shown in the photo.   I am suprised they don’t have black bandanas to cover their faces so they can’t be identified for breaking the Starbucks windows on their way to meeting.  Yeah, “listen intently” to the leftist propaganda.  I have five bucks that says he has a Che poster over his bed in dorms and she secretly wears designer clothing and leather shoes when she goes home to San Marino to pick-up her laundry that the guatemalan housekeeper has carefully cleaned while working 12 hours days for cash under the table.   Exploitation my ass!

It has been a decade of having undergarments in a twist over something that measures only 20 nanometers in diameter.
In a fantastically underplayed way of tiptoeing the stem cell divide, California has added its latest two cents to a contentious national issue that — like many contentious national issues — is portrayed as the chasm between religion and science.
On Wednesday, California’s stem cell researching program awarded $230 million to colleges and companies looking to treat diseases with the regenerative cells. Shockingly, only four of the 14 grant recipients plan to use the money to experiment with embryonic stem cells, which have proven themselves to be one of America’s touchiest tissues.
Because embryonic stem cells are — as the name implies — taken from embryos, much protest has emerged about the inherent ethical dilemma. Boiled down to rudimentary terms, is it ethical to effectively breed and destroy embryos to potentially help cure otherwise life-threatening diseases?
The perpetual potato-potahto debate won’t be quelled any time in the near future, but the grants prove that progress in the field can move beyond the mire of debate. The fact that only four of the institutions plan to pursue embryonic research demonstrates a necessary spirit of compromise.
Earlier this year, President Barack Obama lifted the ban on embryonic research instated by former President George W. Bush, allocating approximately $90 million toward research. California has long been fighting against the ban; in 2004, voters approved a $3-billion move to circumvent Bush’s tricky legistlation.
The benefits of embryonic researching are hard to deny, but recent scientific advances have shown that it may not be the only recourse to fight degenerative diseases. Last April, researchers in La Jolla, Calif. found they could induce pluripotent cells — basically, change skin cells into stem cells by genetically altering them or, in the case of the La Jolla research, channeling proteins into the cells.
If stem cells can be created with the efficacy of embryonic cells, there may be no need to wade into dangerous ethical waters. Stem cell research should be focused on finding these compromises; not all scientific research has to create divides.
Lucy Mueller is a junior majoring in cinema-television production and is the Daily Trojan’s editorial director.
Indeed, the “great scientific progress” we were promised with embryonic stem cells has not happened, and it hasn’t been because such research has been banned (as Joseph so clearly pointed out).
As a matter of fact, the benefits of “embryonic researching” (as Lucy so awkwardly states) are in fact quite easy to deny. Put plainly, they’ve amounted to about nil.
Check your facts. Bush did not ban embryonic stem-cell research. He didn’t even cut of federal funding of ongoing stem-cell research. All he did was decide not to fund projects that would kill new embryos. These projects were perfectly legal. Despite what many university faculty believe, federal funding is not a “right”, and lack of funding does not equate with oppression.
Furthermore, you got it wrong about why embryonic stem cell research is controversial. It is because these cells are harvested from the killing of innocent human beings.

Amnesty International, a major international human rights advocate, recently released a report called Troubled Waters — Palestinians Denied Fair Access to Water. The report has been a fixture on Amnesty’s website’s front page since it was published Tuesday.
In it, Amnesty accuses Israel of pumping disproportionate amounts of water from an aquifer in the West Bank and blocking infrastructure projects to improve the Palestinian water supply.
The report was met with strong resistance from the Israeli government — and for a good reason: It’s wrong. According to the Israeli Water Authority, researchers never contacted them for information, leading me to wonder where they got their numbers.
The Amnesty report claims that the average daily water consumption per person for Palestinians is 70 liters, compared with 300 liters for Israelis. But the Water Authority claims the real figures are 287 liters per person for Palestinians compared to 408 for Israelis.
The report states that Israel is preventing the development and improvement of Palestinian water infrastructure; Water Authority spokesman Uri Shore counters in the Israel National News that the amount of water available to Arabs living in the West Bank and Gaza has increased by 22 percent per person since the Six Day War of 1967. In the same time period water available to Israelis has gone down by 70 percent.
These figures are also deceivingly low since the Palestinian population has grown at a much faster rate than Israel’s.
The Israeli Foreign Ministry also notes that the water arrangements between Israel and the Palestinians are all rooted in agreements between the two parties, and that Israel has supplied double the 6.2 billion gallons of water per year to the Palestinians that was required by the 1995 Oslo Accords.
The Foreign Ministry also points out that the Palestinians “have significantly violated their commitments under the water agreement” by neglecting to construct sewage treatment plants, despite the availability of foreign funding for them, and that the Palestinian Authority has rejected multiple offers to supply Palestinian areas with desalinated water “due to political concerns.”
The report was authored by Donatella Rovera, Amnesty’s researcher on Israel. A bigger and more balanced team might have been more accurate by consulting the Israeli government for figures on its own water usage.
More importantly, this report is part of a broader pattern. Human rights organizations are increasingly losing their focus in the Middle East by disproportionately focusing on violations by Israel — the region’s only democracy.
Human Rights Watch founder Robert L. Bernstein recently published an op-ed in The New York Times criticizing the organization he chaired for 20 years for “helping those who wish to turn Israel into a pariah state.”
“At Human Rights Watch, we always recognized that open, democratic societies have faults and commit abuses,” Bernstein wrote. “But we saw that they have the ability to correct them — through vigorous public debate, an adversarial press and many other mechanisms that encourage reform.
That is why we sought to draw a sharp line between the democratic and nondemocratic worlds, in an effort to create clarity in human rights.”
He also points out that in recent years Human Rights Watch has published more condemnations of Israel than of any other country in the Middle East, even though the region is full of authoritarian regimes that routinely violate human rights.
Amnesty International and the UN Commission on Human Rights have also been prolific in their condemnations.
Israel is home to more than 80 human rights organizations; a free press that criticizes the government often and loudly; a democratic government and a judiciary that frequently rules against popular opinion. In Israel, dissent is not only allowed but encouraged, and basic human freedoms prevail over depravity and authoritarianism.
The same cannot be said for the Arab countries surrounding it. They are mostly ruled by brutal, closed and autocratic regimes that treat their populations without respect.
The countries on Israel’s borders — Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt — are home to far more people than live in Israel, and they could benefit greatly from the attention of large, respected international human rights organizations.
Instead they are ignored as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty continually focus on Israel’s violations. They are often wrong.
International human rights organizations can and should be forces for justice and morality around the world, and they are perhaps needed most in the Middle East.
They should continue to hold Israel to a high standard and report it for violations of human rights.
But by showing such obvious bias against Israel by focusing on it instead of the authoritarian regimes surrounding it and misreporting facts, these organizations are undermining their own credibility and reducing their capability to truly effect change.
Daniel Charnoff is a junior majoring in international relations (global business).
Cheers to all others who have commented. You’ve all done a wonderful job of dismantling the authors arguments in a much calmer and coherent way than I ever could have.
Every source that the article cites to refute Amnesty International’s claims about Palestines water supply comes from the Israeli government itself, which is hardly impartial or “unbiased.”
Also, when nearly all of the most well-respected international human rights groups focus their attention on a single country, something is likely wrong.  Is it an international anti-Semitic conspiracy?  Probably not, what would these organizations have to gain from such a position?
It is true that other countries in he region have problems and should be and usually are justly accused for these problems. However, this is no reason to take more lightly the crimes that Israel is accused of.
“The same cannot be said for the Arab countries surrounding it. They are mostly ruled by brutal, closed and autocratic regimes that treat their populations without respect.”
Says who? How could this writer possibly know that the surrounding countries treat their populations without respect? Mr. Charnoff offers no evidence of this and frankly, it is a dangerous and unfair generalization to make. Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Egypt are all very different and unique in their political structure and social and economic climates, and to make such an ignorant generalization about these countries only holds back real, informed dialogue on the Isreali-Palestinian conflict.
And for the record, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have, on many occasions, run campaigns concerning human rights issues in Lebanon, Egypt and Palestine. This article needs some serious fact-checking in regards to what Mr. Charnoff is saying about these Arab nations, and with the rampant misinformation and incomplete reporting in the media in regards to Arab issues, this is not a matter that should be taken lightly.
The thing is democracy alone can’t give a country a free pass. I love the free press, the high standard of living, etc…. but every other liberal democracy around the world got done with the colonialism thing LAST century. A basic tenet of such a government is equality under the law, and when you have the political subjugation, checkpoints, and such it’s clear that that is not being achieved. Israel’s a peachy democracy for Israelis. I’ll be happy when they let the Palestinians have their own state. Hey, if they run the fledgling society into the ground, then so be it, but the very fact that Israel is deciding how much water is getting to Palestinians means something is wrong here.

The last time USC won a football game in the state of Oregon was in 2005.
The Trojan signal-caller then was Matt Leinart, and the feared USC rushing attack was spearheaded by tandem of LenDale White and Reggie Bush. Oregon had just implemented the spread offense and was using it successfully, quarterbacked by Kellen Clemens.

And now, four years and a devastating 33-31 loss later, the Trojans and Ducks will meet again in Eugene, Ore. on Saturday.
And it seems both sides are still presenting the same problems to each other.
USC still boasts two key running backs — the self-described combination of thunder and lightning, redshirt junior Allen Bradford and junior Joe McKnight. The receivers are there, with juniors Damian Williams and Ronald Johnson slated to start.
“They’re really good,” Oregon coach Chip Kelly said in his Tuesday press conference. “They’ve got athletes at every position, they have a stable of running backs, they’ve got two outstanding receivers.”
And the Trojans’ offensive scheme is the same — albeit not as loose with true freshman Matt Barkley now at the helm of USC coach Pete Carroll’s team instead of the redshirt senior Leinart.
“Pete does a great job of putting those guys in position to make plays,” Kelly said. “It’s a tough scheme to prepare for defensively in terms of what they run because it’s kind of unique.”
Of course, the USC offensive attack will not be at full force. Redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili is expected to miss his second consecutive game with a dislocated shoulder and redshirt junior receiver David Ausberry is all but ruled out with a strained left calf.
McKnight, senior tight end Anthony McCoy and receivers Williams and redshirt freshman Brice Butler all sat out of practice at times this week. McKnight, Williams, and Butler have all been cleared, while McCoy appears to be a game-time decision.
Oregon is also missing its own key skill position player in running back LeGarrette Blount, who was suspended for the rest of the season after the now-infamous punch he planted on Boise State’s Byron Hout after the Ducks’ season-opening loss to the Broncos.
But after the disappointing opener and a close win over Purdue in week two, the Ducks have rebounded, beating consecutive top-20 teams by a combined score of 73-27 and putting together a six-game winning streak.
Junior quarterback Jeremiah Masoli, who completed 18-of-29 passes for 156 yards in Oregon’s 44-10 loss to the Trojans last year, started last week against Washington and ran for two touchdowns while passing for 157 yards. He’s of the same model — a dual-threat at quarterback — as Ohio State’s Terrelle Pryor, who many thought would give USC fits earlier this year.
But the Trojans shut down Pryor and they say it could help them when Masoli takes off running Saturday.
“I think that they are similar in their effect they have on the game is very similar,” Carroll said. “They both run tough and they are hard to tackle.”
With Blount’s untimely suspension came the timely response of sophomore running back LaMichael James. Since the second game of the season, James has put up the second-most rushing numbers of any back in the Pac-10, behind only Stanford’s Toby Gerhart.
James carried the ball 15 times for 154 yards and two touchdowns in the 43-19 win over Washington last week.
“They have presented a tremendous amount of problems for us with their offense,” Carroll said. “It’s such a varied attack with such a good-looking running quarterback with a great style about him. And LaMichael James is really on fire right now, so it’s a very tough attack for us to deal with.”
Saturday’s contest will represent USC’s third road date of the season with a top-25 foe. The first two, Ohio State and Notre Dame, ended as close victories.
The atmosphere at Autzen Stadium will be electric, and as if raucous Oregon fans need any more reason to celebrate, the game will fall on Halloween night.
“We love these opportunities and these situations,” Carroll said. “I think we take them on with a real good attitude that gives you a chance to perform well. We love being in these settings.”

Lucas Clark: There is no two ways about it, this weekend’s matchup between the No. 10 Oregon Ducks and the No. 5 USC Trojans will be the game of the year in the Pac-10 Conference. Both teams feature a talented and versatile offense, which is backed up by two outstanding defenses.
I think we will have a pretty good idea of how the game unfolds by the end of the first few series, in that if the young Duck offensive line cannot create holes for the speedy Oregon running backs then first-year head coach Chip Kelly will have to turn to the passing game.
It’s noisy again · Quarterback Matt Barkley will try to rebound from his two-interception performance last week against Oregon State. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
The Ducks proved they could move the ball through the air against UW last weekend, but the USC secondary is much more talented.
Josh Jovanelly: There is no doubt that Saturday’s game decides the Pac-10. Going into the season, most people circled this game thinking it would be exactly that, but after Oregon lost to Boise State in its first game, everybody seemed to write the Ducks off — much too early obviously.
Oregon’s inexperienced offensive line is definitely the key as Clark said. USC has the size and the speed up front to stop the Duck rushing attack, but the Trojans have had difficulty in the past with the spread rushing offenses.
A few weeks ago, I would have been more confident in USC’s secondary, but after Notre Dame and Oregon State racked up tons of passing yards against the Trojans, USC’s secondary may be more suspect than you think.
LC: You’re right, Oregon was definitely written off too early, but after the performance in Boise, as well as the aftermath, it was probably deserved.
But the one consistent unit throughout the entire season has been the Duck defense. As a unit it’s suffered more injuries than most teams go through in an entire season, yet it has still managed to allow only three touchdowns in four conference games and held one of the nation’s top running backs in Cal’s Jahvid Best to 52 yards rushing.
Middle linebacker Casey Matthews is having a monster year up the middle and it should be an interesting matchup with him and some of the USC backs like Joe McKnight.
JJ: Oregon’s defense has indeed been impressive, especially recently, but it did give up 36 to Purdue and 24 to Utah earlier in the year.
USC’s offense has been clicking recently. Quarterback Matt Barkley seems to be hitting his stride and the coaching staff is more willing to let him stretch the field to receivers Damian Williams and Ronald Johnson. But Barkley has thrown too many interceptions, something the Ducks can take advantage of.
The key to stopping USC is stopping the rush. Matthews will have his hands full with McKnight and running back Allen Bradford, who can provide the power that McKnight lacks. But if the Ducks can slow McKnight and Bradford and force Barkley into bad throws, things could get interesting.
LC: I see Barkley as being the X-factor. I haven’t been completely sold on him so far this season, but his numbers and the fact that he is still only a freshman partially makes up for it. He leads the Pac-10 in passing yards per game with 256.7, but like Jovanelly said, he has had some trouble throwing interceptions.
His efficiency rating of 148.7 is more than impressive, while Oregon quarterback Jeremiah Masoli has improved game by game. Granted, he has only thrown five touchdown passes, but his legs are what make him so dangerous at the position. His seven touchdowns on the ground leads the team and as redshirt freshman LaMichael James gets better so does the Duck offense as a whole.
JJ: A lot of hype has surrounded Barkley and some of it has been a little over the top. He wasn’t putting up the numbers early on in the season, but his poise under pressure is what has set him apart. If ever a true freshman was ready to play in the hostile Autzen Stadium environment, Barkley is that guy, only because he played so calmly against raucous crowds at Ohio State and Notre Dame.
But if Masoli gets going on the ground, USC could be in trouble. USC coach Pete Carroll’s defenses typically struggle against mobile quarterbacks. That’s why Jake Locker had so much success in Washington’s upset of the Trojans.
Masoli looked good last week against Washington and was especially impressive against Cal. He will be the key for the Ducks.

Here’s a scary scenario for USC fans:
It’s Halloween night and the USC football team is up in Eugene, Ore., trick-or-treating. But instead of terrorizing homeowners with intimidation and trepidation, the Trojans fall victim to the spell of the Ducks and leave empty-handed.
This isn’t your far-fetched Halloween horror movie. This is real.
USC arguably runs into its biggest test of the season when it faces No. 10 Oregon in a battle of one-loss teams. ESPN’s College GameDay will be on the scene documenting and analyzing every move. It’s inevitable that analyst Lee Corso will dress up as a Duck or Trojan this Halloween. But the question is: which one?
Both teams still have their sights set on the national championship, but they’ve used two of their three lifelines.
1. Both teams have asked the audience. Turns out the audience favors the Trojans, who are ranked No. 4 in the AP and Coaches’ Polls, over the Ducks, who are ranked No. 10 and No. 12 respectively.
2. Both teams have phoned a friend — a computerized one. That friend is kinder to Oregon, who sits at No. 6 in the computer rankings, than USC, which finds itself down at No. 9.
3. So now, it’s down to the last lifeline: 50/50. The winner will be in the driver’s seat for the Pac-10 title and still in the same car for the national title. But the loser will be forced to make alternate New Year’s plans. Cases could be made for both teams, but USC is the right answer.
Of course, it won’t be easy. The Trojans’ three-game losing streak in the state of Oregon has been well publicized, as has USC’s poor defensive play recently.
In the first five games of the season, USC gave up 40 total points, didn’t allow anyone to throw for more than 237 yards and didn’t give up a single passing touchdown. However, in the last two games against Notre Dame and Oregon State, the defense has been shredded for 63 points and 614 passing yards combined.
But that’s exactly why USC will beat the Ducks. Oregon’s quarterback, Jeremiah Masoli, resembles Ohio State’s Terrelle Pryor more than Notre Dame’s Jimmy Clausen. And USC has had great success against Pryor in the past two years. With defensive ends junior Everson Griffen and redshirt freshman Nick Perry among the nation’s leaders in sacks, the Trojans will knock Masoli down harder than a LeGarrette Blount punch.
Sure, USC lost its last game in Eugene because it had an inexperienced quarterback in Mark Sanchez — who was filling in for an injured John David Booty — but lack of experience won’t be a problem this time. Freshman quarterback Matt Barkley has grown up faster than anyone could have imagined. USC coach Pete Carroll, who’s coached two Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks, has called Barkley an “outlier.”
Barkley is the cool, relaxed Southern California kid who seems to be enjoying everything life throws at him. During his second start against Ohio State in the third-largest college football stadium in the country, he walked into the huddle, smiled and asked, “Isn’t this fun?”
Students have tried to hurl everything at Barkley, from insults to paper. Before the game at Cal, Barkley said the crowd probably wouldn’t be as bad as the crowd at Ohio State. So, the Cal students printed out fliers reminding everyone of this. Barkley responded by throwing for a then career-high 283 yards.
When Barkley says the crowd won’t be a factor, apparently he means it. Barkley is undefeated thus far in his career at USC — redshirt sophomore Aaron Corp played in the game against Washington when Barkley was injured.
Barkley’s success might hinge on the status of senior tight end Anthony McCoy, who sprained his ankle last week. McCoy is questionable for the game, but there’s no questioning the chemistry he’s developed with Barkley. In the game against Notre Dame, McCoy caught five passes for 153 yards, including a huge 60-yard gain as a Fighting Irish defender clung onto his jersey on a critical third down in the second half.
Of course, Barkley’s job is made much easier by the play of USC’s tailbacks. Even though USC lost its most consistent back in senior Stafon Johnson to a weightlifting accident last month, the ground game hasn’t missed a beat.
Senior Allen Bradford has stepped up, running for 147 yards and two touchdowns on 15 carries in USC’s win over Oregon State last week. Bradford, a USA Today first-team Prep All-American in 2005, had been playing in the shadow of Johnson and junior Joe McKnight the past few seasons, so when he finally got his opportunity, he didn’t let it slip away.
Much like the contrasting styles of LenDale White and Reggie Bush, Bradford has become the thunder to McKnight’s lightning. McKnight has finally been living up to the hype that surrounded him during his first two years. He leads the team in almost every rushing category, with 97 carries for 634 yards (an average of 6.4 yards per carry) and seven touchdowns.
With Barkley’s maturation and USC’s unstoppable ground game, the Trojans should give the Ducks quite a fright on Halloween night.
And unfortunately for Oregon, ESPN’s College GameDay will be in Eugene, broadcasting game coverage around the nation. It’s a well-known fact that Carroll’s Trojans play their best games when the national spotlight is on them.
So have no fear, Trojan fans. While Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit and Corso spend the entire day hyping the game, debating the winner and pumping optimism into the Oregon faithful’s’ bloodstream, there is no need to worry.
After Corso dons his Trojan costume and the Trojans take care of business, it will be hard to imagine the national title game without USC.

This is exactly why USC fans are stereotyped as the University of Spoiled Children fans………..all fans talk smack back and forth but arrogance is ripe all the time in USC comments and analysis……….how does 613 yards of offense, 47 points, being contained to 327 total yards, and 20 points (and 3……thats right…..THREE points in the second half) taste?  All I heard all week was how USC is always up for big games and how they never lose big games, and their defense is so good and fast………I have watched a few USC games this year and saw first hand they were not as good as last year and as a Duck fan thought that they would be up for the game but the Autzen magic would lead to some false start penalties (5) and Oregon would pull out a close one, but horry cow Oregon lined up (as Oregon State did last year) and just said we are good, we are running the ball, stop it.  They didn’t at all……….USC can win out and get to a good bowl matchup and if Oregon cannot finish what they have going it means nothing but the Pac-10 title runs through somewhere new for the first time in a while……..Eugene baby!!!  Oh and here is some arrogant fandom right back at you Trojan fan……..47-20 and a four game state of Oregon losing streak……….SCOREBOARD!!!
47-20 Oregon. I guess that settles that! Happy Halloween Trojans and thanks for the “treat” for all us Ducks fans!
USC 7 straight Pac 10 titles countless BCS games, Oregon = ZIP…..get real Duck fans. Oregon never even plays a prime time big game. USC has one every week on TV. Oregon loses to Boise St, lol. Even if you win, you’re ZIP….those are the facts. USC 11 national championships, Oregon = Zip, and on it goes.
Wow, you guys are hilarious.  Really relying on that sound argument huh?  I have no clue about physics or science.  Whatever I have master’s degree fool.  Fully aware of acoustics or sound reverberation.  The shoe is also an acoustical nightmare.  Games well registered over 120 dBs.   Check out there “architecture” and layout douche.  Same thing at ND.  By the way I never sad it wasn’t loud at Autzen.  It’s friggin loud at Washington.  Actually I think Washington holds the record for loudest stadium (check other sources besides ESPN).  By the way have you guys traveled to these other stadiums by the way?
Anderso3 – Stats are stats.  Facts are facts.  Masoli is not a better QB than TP.  Look it up.  As far as a pure athlete is concerned no one oustide of Oregon will agree that Masoli is better.
USCsDECade – Since when did I proclaim a “man-crush”  or I have blind enthusiasm.   Looking for a definition of a man crush look at  Anderso3 comments.   I gave my props to Ducks on D and outlined where the game will be decided.  What are looking for your shot at president of the UN? So sensible you sound. You’re hilarious too bro.
I just maintain that the sound will not be a factor for Barkley as everyone thinks it will.  No need to name call. Captain foolios.
I thought it would be a good game.  Never denied that.  But I see a lot unsubstantiated zeal for Oregon.  I guess will find out soon enough.  LOL god you duck fans need to chill out.  Keep hanging on to your crazy uni’s and  dB’s agrument.  You’re going aneurysmal for no reason.
Peace in the middle east…. seriously
Perfect!  I’m so glad you Trojans are super-confident!  “No Problem.”  “No contest!” & all that….  Keep pouring it on!  Keep stoking the coals in the Duck locker room……
Barkley doesn’t matter. He will throw picks, fumble snaps and bumble through false starts. The crowd WILL get to him. But it won’t matter much. If USC is going to win this game, it’s going to be on the shoulders of their monster running backs. As of late Oregon seems to have some issues tackling – a lot of flinging bodies at runners, very little wrapping up, and the wet conditions won’t help that.  If Oregon stops the run, we win, because Barkley can’t, and won’t, beat us.
Likewise, USC’s defense will have to stop Oregon’s running game. Stopping the passing game won’t be hard, there’s not much of one to begin with (not on a consistent basis anyway). Oregon will get more big passing completions than USC, but not enough to make a huge impact, and almost certainly none for scores.  (By that i mean long passes for a score – I fully expect Ed Dickson to turn a 10-yard reception into a 40-yd TD, but again that’s his running effort).
Defense will be the key. And while USC has great players at every position, Oregon’s defense as a whole is better. I’ve never experienced the saying that “the whole is greater than the sum of its parts” until seeing this defense. It shouldn’t be that good. Man for man, it lacks the size and talent of most top defenses. But as a unit, it’s other-worldly good.
In the end, it will come down to turnovers, and Oregon will win that battle by a +2 margin, with at least one defensive/special teams touchdown to boot. Oregon wins a close one, 21-17. (21-10 going into the fourth, and USC gets a late TD and loses the on-side kick).
Go Ducks, and I hope the Trojan fans who come to Autzen simultaneously have a great time and a miserable time, but most importantly a safe time.
GO DUX!!!!!
Pay little attention to this article duck fans.  Krishnamurti has all the blind enthusiasm as one of you HOT cheerleaders.  Not all USC fans are as naive as this–Autzen will be loud, and Barkley may struggle.  We will have to rely on our offensive and defensive lines that are chalk full of athletic future NFLers.
Our team, thank god, does not completely rely on Barkley’s ability to be a “cool, relaxed Southern California kid who seems to be enjoying everything life throws at him”.  Though Krishnamurti’s man crush would have you think otherwise.
The game will be close, and that is a fact.  We will usually have more skill than anyone in the pac-10, but the ducks chemistry this year is far superior to any other teams’ in the country.  I hate playing in the northwest, and I would not be surprised to see USC take a loss here.  That being said though, we are USC and the Pac-10 crown is still ours to take.  I don’t forsee that happening for another couple of years.  Maybe when LaMichael James, Boyett(sp?), Cliff Harris, and Darron Thomas become upperclassman–that will be a scary freaking team….
Wow.  That’s a well written and intelligent comment.  I think we got you, though.
Go DUX!
Size isn’t everything kris. It’s not the number of people alone that make Autzen as loud as it gets. It’s the way the stadium is built. The croud is litterally right on top of the field with the stands pretty much going straight up so that it traps the sound on the field. USC fans should be really worried, because you aren’t leaving Oregon with a win.
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!
Do people commenting even watch football?  Hmmm. Okay some facts….
Autzen louder than the Shoe.? 106k fans > 54k fans.  I think Barkley is battle tested and ready for the noise and atmosphere.
Masoli is a more talented athlete/runner than Pryor?  I don’t think so.  The stats don’t prove he’s a better passer either.  See yahoo.  I also don’t think the scheme has any impact.  Ohio ran a wildcat and option spread among other things against USC.  They tried everything with Pryor that game.
Don’t infer anything from Washington Loss/Win – USC/Oregon.  Set aside personnel issues. Turnovers dictated most of the direction for each of those games.  I think PC will have Barkley keen on watching his throws, especially after last week.
Credit – Ducks are showing up on D this year.    However, I think we stop Oregon’s gimmick spread as usual.   Each team’s linemen will determine how close this game is for Oregon.  Assuming no turnovers, if we run it down their throats not a friggin chance for an Oregon win.
I’m excited.  Should be a showcase game for those outside of the conference to see how PAC-10 football is really played.
Having gone to both USC and Oregon, I know the passion on both sides for these school…
It will be loud and wild.  Krishnamutri has no clue about the physics of sound and crowds.  The “shoe” is not very loud simply because of the open space.  The loudest game recorded in college football according to ESPN is the 2007 USC/Oregon Game at Autzen @ 127.2db.  Autzen is the most intimidating place in the country and it will be full of energy.
Oregon is peaking now and getting better every week.  The Trojans are struggling this year.  The past three weeks especially….look at common opponents:
Washington (Ducks 43-Huskies 19)(Trojans 13-Huskies 16)
California (Ducks 42-Bears 3)(Trojans 30-Bears 3)
WSU (Ducks 52-Cougs 6)( Trojans 27-Cougs 6)
It will be a shootout, but the Ducks will prevail.
Krishnamurti,
I have a few comments about your article. The first and foremost point is the point about the noise of the fans in Autzen Stadium. Yes, the Shoe does boast a whopping 106,000 fans that can get quite loud, but the sunken nature of Autzen and the way that the fans are right on top of the action makes it much louder than many other stadiums. It has been in the top 3 loudest college football venues consistently, and one ESPN reporter goes on to say that it is actually louder than Death Valley and The Swamp. What makes Autzen so memorable is the fans. Even Kirk Herbstriet the other day said that Autzen Stadium is the loudest stadium per capita. Just imaging how loud that place would be if the stadium could hold numbers like that of USC, Ohio State, and Michigan.
The second point that I would like to address is addressing the question of: who is better, terrell pryor or jeremiah masoli? I believe the clear answer to this is actually Jeremiah Masoli, who last year burst onto the scene as a D-I college quarterback. Not counting the Boise State game, Masoli has been an absolute monster, finally starting to connect with his receivers down-field for big plays. He has an amazing arm and is very elusive when scrambling. Terrell Pryor, on the other hand, is still a very immature quarterback, and though he may become one of the best quarterbacks in the nation, he has still not surpassed Masoli in knowledge and speed. Masoli brings a tough game along with him where other quarterbacks would just slide down to their knees.
Oh, and one more point. I will be in the student section of Autzen Stadium Saturday and have one last thing to say.
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FIGHT ON OREGON!!!!!
Puh-lease. USC plays well when the spotlight is on them? Did the Author forget about USC’s last trip to Eugene? Big game. National spotlight. They lost. How about last year against Oregon State? Thursday night game. number one team in the country. Spotlight is on them. They lost.
Trying to compare Masoli to Pryor is like comparing apples to oranges. Their two offensive systems are complete opposites. We all know that Pryor struggles as a drop back passer. Put him in a spread offense like Oregons and he would light up the USC defense.
I respect your enthusiasm, but let’s get real. The noise at Autzen is definitly going to be a factor when they cause false start after false start when Barkley cant get the play call to his team mates.
Oregon wins, and wins by at least two scores. I’ll say 35-17 Oregon.
This article has little to no factual or statistical information to support any of the theories. its just the head coach, freshman Qb’s, and Authors opinion. Its completely ridiculous, statements like “It’s a well-known fact that Carroll’s Trojans play their best games when the national spotlight is on them.” if that was true would the trojans have lost in Eugene in ’07 when the game was featured on National TV? I think not.
Dude, come on, you can’t be serious. You’re actually critiquing this article about a SPORTING COMPETITION between two teams for not supporting all of its statements with concrete evidence? Is that a joke?
A football game will be played. Nobody can be certain of the victor until the game is over and one team has scored more points than the other. That is the fact. This author wrote an article with a little bit of excitement and school spirit stating some reasons that he thinks our football team will ultimately win the game. Loosen up.
OK – So you want some stats, here you go.  Oregon has feasted on 4 pac-10 teams.  3 of them were the worst defenses in the PAC-10 and the other was UCLA.  They have the worst passing offense in the PAC-10 and that is after playing the 3 worst pass defenses in the PAC-10.  They need to run a spread offense to get their running game going, but USC’s team speed will negate that.  SC is vulnerable between the tackles, not via the spread.  SC’s defense over the past 2 games have been exposed by solid passing from solid quarterbacks, not via the running game
So we are playing against a team that needs to run the ball with an iffy quarterback.   Don’t be surprised if SC gets up early that the Duck crowd becomes quiet when their qb needs to throw and can’t.  SC wins this game going away and the Ducks get exposed for what they are…. an average team that beats bad competition via turnovers and a strong running game…
Any Questions???
Haha!
It’s gonna be a tough game, and don’t think I’d go as far a declaring a sure-fire winner, but HELLO!
Matt Barkley has no idea what Autzen Stadium is like. Just ask Mark Sanchez, who threw two interceptions in 2007.
But if Matt Barkley can play lights out and quiet the Autzen crowd on his way to victory, then kudos to him.
It’s going to be insane.
Duck fans.  Do you ever leave your state?  Have you ever been to a football game at the Shoe?  Were you there when SC played Ohio State?  You have no idea how loud that stadium was and the bottom line is that Barkley couldn’t hear anything during the final drive anyway.  To somehow think that your stadium and your 50,000 fans will make a difference after what he’s already been through is myopic at best and plain dumb at worst.  If SC loses it will be because your special teams will have made a different.  It won’t be false starts and fumbling the ball.  Remember, this isn’t Cal and the Jeff Tedford collapse team that you blew out earlier.
Today is your midterm exam.  Let’s see if all the smack equals a win.  Let’s see if your QB can throw the ball and if your defense and line are up to the task.  I don’t think they are and just watching Duck fans get on the SC newspaper message board to proclaim their greatness after beating no one is a bit absurd.  Heck, I’d be surprised if you can get past Oregon State.
Wow, sounds like Mr. Martin was a little too confident.  You are quite the pompass ass, because look who just kicked your Trojan’s ass.  The Ducks.  I take it that you have never been to Autzen, and seeing how may false start penalties the Trojans had you can just shut your mouth about that.  Douche!!!

What was that ?  Can you repeat that, I didnt quite catch it.  HAHAHA!
Well I guess maybe we still havnt beat anybody because USC was a joke! lol

In 2002, four North London blokes banded together to form The Rakes — a snappy, in-your-face rock band known for its politically conscious tunes and moody melodies. Spitting humor and lyric-heavy songs across two successful records, the band released its newest album Klang on Oct. 20.
Over seven wild years, the young quartet made of childhood buddies and fellow garage bums attracted a brigade of dedicated supporters from their English hometown and quickly grew a fanatical, cult-like following in the United States. Quirky and ridiculously fashionable, The Rakes made the transition from artsy musical alley cats roaming the streets of SoHo to international indie rockers enjoying decent success in the States most other acts only dream of.
Last hurrah · Following the cancellation of its UK and US tours this month, British indie-rock band The Rakes split up indefinitely last week. - Photo courtesy of The Rakes
If this flowery language is sounding at all like an obituary, it’s meant to.
Apologies in advance for being the bearer of bad news, but unless you’re already a part of the band’s core fan base, you probably haven’t heard that Klang is not only The Rakes’ third CD, but also its last. The boys surprisingly cancelled the rest of their UK and US tour dates (they would have played in LA this month) and (say it isn’t so) last week the British performers called it quits indefinitely with their decision to part ways “effective immediately.”
The band’s unexpected breakup comes on the heels of a highly anticipated tour and final LP which, despite backstage drama, is actually well done. A swift departure from their last album, The Rakes have evolved musically, experimenting with a range of song styles and producing a post-punk palette of pure variety. Critics completely unknowing of the fact that The Rakes were heading toward splitsville would have assumed the boys were well on their way to the top.
To produce the 10 tracks featured on Klang, the band relocated from their normal London studio to an ex-Soviet radio station building in Berlin. Along with a new environment, the freshness of the sound was somewhat forced; the album was created in a mere two weeks with each song recorded in a day, adding the pressure of a strict deadline. Rather than focusing on production, the band wanted to intimately capture a performance.
In line with The Rakes’ previous material, Klang is in no shortage of the usual addicting angst made to challenge the dullness of everyday life. On “Bitchin’ in the Kitchen,” a thumping bass and stringy guitar are joined with intriguing lyrics describing the rescue of a girl from the doom of domestic labor. Sly and suggestive, a catchy hook promises to take her outside to have a good time. The track’s presence of an actual melody helps it stand out from robotic tunes like the repetitive “You’re In It,” the band’s best example of a head banger — loud and catchy. Chaotic and muddled with syncopated yelling and overpowering instruments throughout.
While uniquely executed, The Rakes’ sound on Klang isn’t really unique itself, existing as a comprehensive sampling of modern electro-pop rock already out today. Alan Donohoe, the band’s lead singer, channels a mix between the undecipherable yet fixating vocals of Killers’ vocalist Brandon Flowers and the voiced spontaneity of Brendon Urie, the front man of yet another recent punk-rock casualty, Panic at the Disco.
Overall, his monotonous drones blended with the occasional moments of singing are refreshing and enjoyable, as long as they are not drowned out by background noise.
While Klang stands as a solid album on its own, the shock of the band forever bowing out from the industry overshadows the music, a development that can’t be overlooked. The Rakes leave behind a nearly decade-long legacy, which fans will undoubtedly miss.
They will also miss the skinny ties and striped polos. The band’s style landed them attention from high fashion heavy-hitters like the ex-head designer of Dior Homme, and even produced the soundtrack for one of his runway shows.
Back in 2005, they increased their groupie count getting face time in America while touring with Franz Ferdinand. Now,  with its final imprint on the music world, The Rakes have managed to produce punk-indie fusion with attitude overflowing into Klang.
Everybody wants to go out with a bang. The Rakes finish strong, producing an album to be proud of and ending on one good last note.

As Saw VI festers in theaters, American horror and the torture-porn subgenre have become inextricably connected. And just about nobody sees this as a step in the right direction.
The main flaw usually assigned to these particular horror films is the nihilistic quality of the violence. After all, without characters identifiable on a psychological level, the only connection a person can forge with a tortured co ed is a visceral one. There’s terror to be found in graphic mutilation, but not the kind that sticks around after the credits roll.
Lars von Trier addresses this issue with Antichrist. After Michel Haneke’s 2007 Funny Games US remake, Antichrist is the second film on psychological and physical torture by a celebrated European auteur in recent years.
Von Trier — legendarily arrogant Danish filmmaker behind Breaking the Waves and Dogville — has never had a film arrive in theaters without a trail of controversy. Antichrist is no different, and the debate over its merits rages on with each review posted.
Antichrist is the study of the psychological deformation of a married couple (Willem Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, both brilliant) that loses a child. To help cure his wife’s dangerous depression, the husband retreats with her to their forest cabin (called Eden) where things, as they say, take a turn toward the very weird.
As Dafoe and Gainsbourg play menacing games with each other in the woods, the film’s plot and characters become almost incomprehensible, especially in a single viewing. A film initially about grief suddenly becomes about societal perceptions of women — a common subject for von Trier — and as the film’s setting becomes more surreal and horrifying, so do the actions of the characters.
Antichrist works on both a visceral and psychological level, but the story’s sudden twists and turns might be too much for an audience already assaulted by a breadth of jarring images and cinematic technique.
The director’s semi-deserved status as, well, that Danish asshole might turn the average horror-lover away from Antichrist; the film is replete with examples of what a glib cultural critic like Family Guy would call pretentious European art film flourishes.
To von Trier’s credit, most of those artistic decisions work the way they are intended to — he breaks established cinematic rules to continually increase the audience’s discomfort. And, Antichrist might also contain the only appropriate use of a fisheye lens ever in a film.
Even Dafoe’s strange encounter with an animal at the midpoint of the film, which sets the entire audience into giggles, becomes terrifying once the mind overcomes the silliness of the moment and places it within the context of von Trier’s world. Antichrist works because every scene, regardless of sheer strangeness, adds to the underlying tension and horror of the piece as a whole.
The film continually builds its truly off-putting surreal atmosphere, and von Trier is smart enough to give his audience release. The final 30 minutes are among the most psychologically and visually scarring that I have ever seen in a film. Von Trier lets the graphic sexuality and horrific violence of the disintegration of the characters’ world match the internal terror and despair they feel throughout the film’s first two-thirds. For once, the emotional identification we find with the characters is deserved and — wonderfully — truly lasting.
Antichrist demands comparison to the aforementioned Funny Games Haneke’s examination of an upper-class American family’s collision with a psychotic but charming pair of youths is seemingly borrowed from A Clockwork Orange. Haneke, a former psychologist and director of the great Caché, made the film as a cinematic experiment in seeing just how much banal death and torture Americans could stand before leaving their seats in disgust.
What sets von Trier’s film apart from Haneke’s is that, for all of the Danish director’s strange artistic choices, Antichrist takes itself very seriously. Funny Games was about getting into the skulls of a torture-porn lover and showing them the banality of the violence.
Haneke’s smirking, self-satisfied object lesson of a film was so infuriating because it didn’t treat itself or its audience with any respect. Sure, the film is deeply unsettling in its own right, but once the lights return and you re-enter the real world, the realization that Haneke was trying to force a lesson essentially meant for mainstream American audiences down the throats of a smaller art house crowd leaves a bitter taste indeed.
Both Antichrist and the concurrently released Paranormal Activity are horror films about the way that breaking the rules of cinema and video can shake us deeply. Antichrist also appeals to the secretly sadomasochistic impulses in our psyches and then violent upsets those impulses in its psychotic conclusion.
If the Saw and Hostel films hold some attractive power over you, Antichrist might be, against all reason, your favorite horror film of 2009. Even if you consider the very name Lars von Trier to be inseparably associated with incomprehensible European art films, the maverick auteur is still the master behind the most challenging horror film of the year — a work truly worthy of the season when we actively seek to be frightened.

Things always seem to fall into place for senior Kenton Chen.
His performance Friday at Café Metropol, as part of this weekend’s first Asian American Jazz Festival in Los Angeles, will be no different than the serendipitous events of his past.
In tune · Senior Kenton Chen will be performing at the Asian American Jazz Festival this weekend. His debut album will be released in December. - Photo courtesy of Kenton Chen
“My life has been a lot of beautiful coincidences. You go places and you end up in different situations you never think will put you in the perfect spot until you realize here you are,” Chen said.
Music managed to always find Chen, a Southern California native and USC senior, at various stages of his life. In middle school, a friend who did not want to audition for a musical theater class alone urged Chen to try out with her; in high school a scheduling mishap left him in a choir class he was convinced he would dislike but ended up loving.
He entered USC as a math major thinking he wanted to be a math teacher, but immediately dropped the major and dabbled in theater, psychology and business, until he returned to music — the inescapable kismet in his life. Now he majors in jazz studies and creative writing.
“My goal in life is to forever strive to be the consummate artist, whether it’s writing music or writing words,” Chen said.
Earlier this year, Chen worked on a small singing gig for the Café Metropol booker. In May, the booker, returning the favor, invited Chen to take part in the three-day premiere event that will highlight the unique cultural influence Asian and Asian-American musicians have brought to the jazz world.
“As time went on, I realized how big of an endeavor I signed on for, and I’m just super excited to be a part of such a promising event,” Chen wrote in an email.
He will croon an hour-long set of familiar jazz tunes and one original song from his album — a year-long project that will be released in December.
“The project was suppose to be small, it was suppose to be something small and simple for me. And it just got bigger and bigger and bigger,” Chen said. “A year later, all of a sudden, I’m telling this story that I’m dying to share with the world.”
The album, Something about Love, draws from Chen’s personal experiences and tells a story about the complexity of falling in love through 14 songs.
In May he held a concert previewing songs from his upcoming album, but all the songs have changed since the preview performance. Chen says he likes to play with his music, especially with words and instrumentations.
His songs might be ever-changing, but his before-show routine remains the same. Chen admits he is always nervous and rarely eats before performing. But before he goes on stage, he reminds himself that it’s not about him.
“Really it’s about the music. It’s about having fun and conveying the message and really relating to the people who are coming,” Chen said.
Although Chen would not label himself as just a jazz musician, his innovation of the genre makes him a fitting performer for the festival, which seeks to highlight Asian artists who bring different backgrounds to jazz but are still connected by their shared identity as Asians.
“It’s hard to place me inside a particular genre because I don’t quite fit into any of it. I never really was that much into jazz, but as I listen to it more I really do fall in love with the genre,” Chen said. “However, I do like to take things out. The way that I sing jazz is very pop influenced and the way I sing pop is very jazz influenced.”
When questioned about his plans for after graduation, Chen waves his hand while a breeze goes by and answers, “I want to be an unhinged individual and let the wind carry me wherever it is. I love the wind I think it’s a really great metaphor for how we should live life.”
He then lightheartedly adds, “After all, if the world is going to end in 2012, I better start cracking.”
Having grown up in Irvine, Calif. Chen admits he does not know much outside of his home state, but hopes to live in Seattle and New York at some point in his life.
Although his future location is uncertain, Chen knows that music will inevitably be a part of his life’s blue plan.
“If there’s anything I’ve learned in college it’s that I cannot give live music up,” he said. “It’s just intrinsically part of me. I will never get away from it.”
The Asian American Jazz Festival will take place Friday through Sunday. About a dozen artists will perform at Café Metropol and at the Japanese American National Museum’s outdoor amphitheatre.

When something is described as the best-kept secret in Los Angeles, it usually means it is the worst-kept secret among adolescents wallowing in various forms of pretension. One look at the gigantic line for the September screening of The Room at the Laemmle Sunset 5 Theater in West Hollywood did little to refute this stereotype.
The queue, which stretched all the way around the top floor of the shopping complex, was mostly composed of 20-somethings with skinny jeans and Avril Lavigne-slung ties. But the enthusiasm that greeted the smash-flop’s writer, director and star — the infamously enigmatic Tommy Wiseau — was a far cry from cynicism.
Torn apart · Through midnight screenings, Tommy Wiseau’s The Room became an unlikely cult classic after its Los Angeles release in 2003. - Photo courtesy of theroommovie.com
After standing precariously on a flower pot to greet his adoring fans (and, inexplicably, rallying them to count to four in unison), the lanky, long-haired some-kind-of-European made his rounds, stopping to fist pound various teens and take pictures with his many admirers, always sporting a goofy smile and a Nixonian peace sign. In a wave of sincerity not sported by hipsters in years, the crowd swallowed him whole.
The Room, a dubiously financed independent flick that first gained notice because of an ominous billboard in Hollywood that Wiseau rented, was released in 2003. It was overwhelmingly ignored.
Since then, the movie has slowly built a cult following in Los Angeles, where it is shown on the last Saturday of every month at Sunset 5. The crowds, which have grown exponentially in the past year following press coverage of the phenomenon, are reminiscent of Rocky Horror Picture Show midnight viewings at Time Square — boisterous, costumed and toting plastic utensils.
The movie is only one part of the sound and fury that surrounds the monthly pageant. The DVD jacket and billboard credit it with “the passion of Tenessee Williams,” a blurb that appears in quotes, though without attribution. The movie is also self-heralded as a “quirky black comedy,” breezingpast the fact that all the comedy is blatantly unintentional.
But how did The Room come to be the humorless romp so critically unacknowledged and flocked to by Angelenos?
The truth is there is no one element of the movie that gives it its je ne sais quoi. Its main character, Johnny, is a 40-something businessman with a horrible accent (almost all of which is painfully dubbed over in post-production) in love with Lisa, a blonde, tragically big-boned girl who it turns out is having an affair with the film’s one attractive character, Mark.
The audience must endure three graphic sex scenes between Johnny and Lisa. The scenes recycle the exact same shots to the tune of “You’re My Rose,” one of the many strange hip-hop/elevator music fusion songs that appear in the film.
Lisa also enjoys several romps in the sack with Mark, her erstwhile flame who experiences strong but fleeting feelings of guilt for sleeping with his friend’s fiancée.
Lisa’s faults are numerous, and the audience latches onto them with the cheerful vindictiveness.
In one scene, a strange protuberance appears in her neck, moving grotesquely every time she talks, prompting general groans of disgust. (One viewer came dressed as Lisa, complete with black pipe cleaners above her eyes and a prosthetic neck bone.) She is strangely guy-polar, vacillating between protesting her love for Johnny and placing seductive, come-hither phone calls to Johnny’s self-professed best friend, Mark.
Lisa’s mother, Claudette, is equally psychotic. Portrayed as a shrill gold-digger, she brings up one of many plotlines that are thereafter ignored for the remainder of the film.
“Everything is going wrong at once. Nobody wants to help me. And, I’m dying,” she tells her daughter in one of her many three-minute visits.
“You’re not dying, Mom,” Lisa says with an annoyed sigh. And then comes one of the best-delivered lines of the film. (A general anticipatory hush fell over the audience at this point.) “I got the test of the test back, “ Claudette says, shrugging her leopard-print clad shoulders. “I definitely have breast cancer.” She says this as if submitting a confident order to a Starbucks barista.
Watching The Room makes one wonder what evil shrew screwed Wiseau over in the past, as the movie seems like a poorly shrouded and heavily self-indulgent autobiography. Johnny is the American businessman, friend to all, beloved by random flower-shop owners and baristas, but ultimately is barrel-rolled by the (sort of) buxom blonde social mountaineer.
In the end — even though Johnny’s story is saccharine and self-pitying — the audience applauds him and booes his evil fiancée, his conniving best friend and his ostensibly cancer-ridden mother-in-law.
Here is the beauty of The Room: It is the first movie to rally a generation lost to cynicism around the core, wonderfully schmaltzy story of the Everyman. Sure, the audio may look as if it’s been poorly dubbed from another language (it’s not), and the video looks as if the director of photography was working with a faulty focus lens (we can only assume this was not the case). But ultimately, The Room is Tommy Wiseau’s masterpiece about how a greasy-haired, thickly accented Christ figure can win the affection of his peers by just being his unintelligible self — an archetype that speaks to scenesters everywhere.

The USC women’s cross country team has spent much of the season trying to recover from the flu and injury.
The week when all of the Women of Troy’s top runners are finally healthy could not have come at a better time.
“From the beginning of August until the end of last week, we had someone sick or hurt every single week,” said USC coach Tom Walsh. “I’m glad it’s behind us now.”
Finally armed with what Walsh believes are its strongest nine runners, USC will host the Pac-10 Conference Championships for the first time since 1999 on Friday at Skylinks Golf Course in Long Beach, Calif. And although USC will face daunting competition, Walsh believes the home-course advantage will benefit the team.
“Since we’re hosting it, we got to put the course together,” he said. “It will be a very flat, very fast course. I think we’ll do really well on it.”
The Pac-10 features four nationally ranked women’s squads: No. 17 Arizona, No. 12 Stanford, No. 8 Oregon and No. 1 Washington. With the incredible quality of competition at the meet, Walsh’s expectations are realistic.
“I want to be really competitive,” he said. “It’s a stretch for us to be in the top five. But if we can be as competitive as possible and beat our rival UCLA and finish somewhere in the middle of the pack, then that would be an outstanding performance by these girls.”
The Women of Troy include a few standouts, like junior Zsofia Erdelyi, as well as a few surprise runners, like junior Dina Kitayama, who used strong October surges to vault into contention for USC’s Pac-10 squad. Walsh said choosing the runners who would fill out the last few roster spots proved to be a difficult decision.
“There were five people competing for the last two spots who I could have realistically chosen,” Walsh said. “I went with my gut and who I think will respond to pressure and run the best on that day.”
Rounding out USC’s team are senior captain Bridget Helgerson, junior Christine Cortez, senior Katherine Ellis, junior Zara Lukens, sophomore Leah Gaeta, and freshmen Kathleen Moloney and Kelly Owen. Walsh said all nine girls have had strong practices in the weeks leading up to Friday’s meet.
“It reminds me of last year,” Walsh said. “This time last year is when we really started to practice well and ended up having a breakout race [at Bakersfield]. We’ve had those types of practices leading up to this meet, so I’m hoping it carries over.”
The Pac-10 men’s and women’s Cross Country Championships will be Friday, with the men running at 3 p.m., and the women at 4 p.m.

On Dec. 7, 2007, the USC women’s soccer team defeated UCLA 2-1 in the NCAA semifinals on its way to the program’s first national championship. That win, however, represents USC’s only victory against the Bruins in the last 11 games of the crosstown series.
The Women of Troy are 3-17-1 all time against UCLA, including a pair of losses to their rivals last season.
“It’s a step the program needs to take,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said about beating UCLA.
Doing that will be no easy task again this season, with the Bruins (14-2-1, 5-1) entering Friday night’s nationally televised match ranked No. 3 in the nation.
No. 18 USC (12-5, 4-2) will have to first contend with a trio of dangerous Bruin attackers.
Senior forward Lauren Cheney, who has played 16 games for the United States women’s national team including three games at the 2008 Olympics, is a three-time first-team All-American and has nine goals and six assists on the year.
Sophomore forward Sydney Leroux is tied for second in the Pac-10 with 15 goals on the season and senior forward Kristina Larsen has added eight goals.
“They’ve got a ton of great players,” USC senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen said.
UCLA has won 14 of their last 15 games, the only blemish being a 2-0 road loss to No. 1 Stanford.
USC sits in fourth place in the Pac-10, two spots behind the Bruins, after a weekend split at home with the Oregon schools.
Khosroshahin was pleased with his team’s improved effort in Sunday’s 1-0 win over the Ducks but still thinks his team can play better.
“We have to play smarter,” Khosroshahin said. “If we don’t play smarter, it’s going be a difficult match.”
USC will rely heavily on Olsen, an All-American between the pipes. Olsen has been named Pac-10 Player of the Week twice this season and leads the Pac-10 with 80 saves, 30 more than her closest competitor.
“She’s a huge player for us,” redshirt senior defender Meagan Holmes said. “Every game she comes up big for us and I can always count on her back there.”
Junior midfielder Alyssa Dávila will be counted on to lead the Women of Troy offense against a stout Bruins back line. Dávila leads USC with nine goals and is tied for the team-high in assists with four.
Looking to change up his team’s fortunes after an upset loss to Oregon State last Friday, Khosroshahin inserted Dávila into the starting lineup against Oregon. The move paid off as she scored what proved to be the game-winning goal less than eight minutes into the match.
The Women of Troy understand the importance of the rivalry with the Bruins, but they say they’re treating it like any other game.
“We’re just going to play our game and not change anything for them,” Holmes said.
“Big rivalry,” Dávila added. “But we’re just looking forward to taking care of business.”
Friday’s game will kick off at 7 p.m. at UCLA’s Drake Stadium, the site of UCLA’s 1-0 win in the NCAA tournament round of 16 that ended USC’s season a year ago.

This weekend the No. 16 USC women’s volleyball team will try to do what every team has struggled to do in the Pac-10 this season: win on the road.
In what might be the toughest women’s volleyball conference of all time — eight teams in the Pac-10 are ranked in the Coaches Top 25 Poll — the Women of Troy will try to reverse a conference trend and record two victories this weekend away from their home court.
Led by sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter and senior outside hitter Jessica Gysin, USC (15-6, 4-5) will travel to Northern California to face No. 4 Stanford (14-5, 7-2) tonight and No. 14 Cal (12-7, 5-4) Saturday in two road matches that the Women of Troy must win in order to keep their conference title hopes alive.
Although USC dropped four straight matches heading into last weekend, the Women of Troy swept both Oregon and Oregon State at the Galen Center. USC coach Mick Haley hopes that his team’s recent success has given his players the poise to play successfully on the road.
“I think we’ve got our confidence back,” Haley said. “We have a clear vision of what we’re trying to do and where we can go with this.”
The Cardinal, however, is sure to put USC’s confidence to test. Stanford is arguably the conference’s best team and swept USC (25-23, 35-33, 25-18) at the Galen Center in three tight matches earlier this season. Still, USC feels it can fix the small errors that cost it the match on Oct. 3 and pull out a big road victory.
“We don’t feel like this is an insurmountable task,” Haley said. “We feel confident that we are right on the same level with Stanford, and we know that if we can win two this weekend, we’re back in the hunt for the conference championship.”
Stanford, the highest ranked team in the conference, averages 13.92 kills per set and 2.58 blocks per set. Senior middle blocker Janet Okogbaa leads the team with 199 kills (2.76 kps) for a .373 hitting percentage and is second in the Pac-10 in blocking (1.33 bps). Junior outside hitter Alix Klineman has a team-leading 273 kills (3.96 kps) with 154 digs (2.23 dps) and 39 blocks (0.57 bps).
While Stanford focuses more on moving the ball around to set up their attack, Cal relies on its aggressiveness to score, which can also pose a challenge to the Women of Troy as well.
USC beat Cal in a five-set thriller (22-25, 29-27, 25-19, 16-25, 22-20) earlier this season at the Galen Center and will look to post another victory over its cross-state rival Saturday. USC-Cal battles are always tight and tend to go the distance before either team posts a win.
“We always felt we played pretty well at Cal,” Haley said. “We have a lot to prove in ourselves going back up there.”
The Golden Bears average 13.96 kills per set and 2.63 blocks per set and are third among Pac-10 teams with a .274 hitting percentage. Senior outside hitter Hana Cutura has 360 kills (5.07 kps) and 396.0 points (5.58 pps) and leads all Pac-10 players in kills and points. Senior middle hitter Mindi Wiley is third among Pac-10 players in hitting percentage (.378) and has 74 blocks (1.04 bps) with 180 kills (2.54 kps).
With two tough opponents ahead, Haley is looking for his team to make a statement on the road and start moving up the conference ladder.
“All the Pac-10 teams have been winning at home and losing on the road,” he said. “We need to go into somebody else’s house and start winning, and we need to do it two times this weekend.”

Three songs into the encore and fans are still asking for more, hoping that their night with Regina Spektor Wednesday never ends; then, the ever familiar words ring through the Greek Theatre: I hear in my mind all these of voices/I hear in my mind all of these words/I hear in my mind all of this music. But Spektor is certainly not breaking our hearts.
The lyrics of her hit song “Fidelity” seem to be appropriate. Her style, demeanor and talent enchant the audience from the moment her fingers touch the keys of the piano. You will certainly get “lost in the sounds.”
No doubt, Spektor has talent. Besides the fact that she could be a classical pianist prodigy and that her voice never moves off key, Spektor entertains crowds with her sweet charm, quirky stories and obvious love for music.
Sauntering onto the stage in a poofy white dress decorated with a black, cardboard bow and looking like the epitome of child-like innocence, she opens the concert with “The Calculation,” a song from her new album, Far. Similar to many of her songs, “The Calculation” boasts a strong piano introduction.
Never hearing the same sort of piano riff more than once, she varies up her pieces with abrupt, bold chords and slow, romantic phrases. Spektor meshes different emotions into her pieces by incorporating these two styles within her songs rather than within her albums.
Excitement in the audience rose during “Machine,” which mimics the coldness and rigidness of an inanimate object through the use of dissonant chords. But in the middle, she surprised fans with a modern version of what sounded like an 18th century classical song.
Spektor is definitely full of surprises. One thing a concert-goer will learn is not to be deceived by her sweet nature. Giggling in between songs, she would smile at the audience and say, “Thank you very much,” but not in the Elvis Presley sort of way.  When she is not singing, her dainty voice instantly puts a smile on faces. But as soon as she starts to bellow out her next set, Spektor exudes confidence and ease.
Underneath her fairy-tale persona, a rocker lives. Watching Spektor’s two different yet fitting personalities coexist is what makes her music so much more enthralling. One moment during the evening, Spektor and her background violinists, cellists and drummer rock on to the Begin to Hope song, “On the Radio.” In the last few seconds she gets the audience to clap along, while a fan comments that her music is “a good philosophy for life.” The next moment Spektor is singing about drinking and going for a blues feel on her teal guitar. Adding to the message, she slurs her words and drops a few surprising curse words.
Though Spektor does rock and blues, most of her pieces are heart-felt ballads. Caught up in full body goose bumps, and maybe a few tears, fans move along to her melodious lyrics. Behind her seven-foot black Steinway a disco ball creates a star-like effect on the backdrop and the lyrics to “Samson,” resonate: I loved you first beneath the stars. Her soft voice accompanied by the slow and tender sounds of the piano can only be described as sincere emotion.
Spektor has the ability to transform a person unfamiliar with her music to a devoted fan within two hours. The reason: she simply isn’t afraid to take risks. It is not an understatement to note her originality. From the Russian quotations to the Hemingway references and to the syncopation of her voice, the list of individuality could go on. At one point, she pulls up a wooden chair and starts striking it with a drumstick, while playing the piano with just her left hand — not to mention she continues singing to perfection.
Light-hearted humor and eccentricity are only part of Spektor’s captivating performance style. But quirky pretty much defines her lyrics. It doesn’t really matter whether her metaphors or outlandish imagery confuse her listeners; in the end, they feel the humor, sorrow, or anger she meant to portray.
The concert seemed to bridge the gap between audience member and celebrity musician. Under the Greek architecture, the outdoor venue created a backyard-esque event as if Spektor were performing for a large group of friends.
On an unusually brisk Los Angeles night, Spektor’s fairytale music warmed fans in a magical way. And it’s contagious.
