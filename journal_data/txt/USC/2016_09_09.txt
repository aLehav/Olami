The women’s soccer team defeated Loyola Marymount at McAlister Field 2-0 on Friday behind goals from junior Nicole Molen and senior Morgan Andrews. 
The win comes after the Trojans swept a tournament in Auburn last weekend. Although USC opened the 2016 season with two straight losses, the team won its next three, and the Women of Troy made it four on Friday with a 2-0 win against the Lions.
Molen opened the scoring in the 15th minute. The midfielder collided with LMU goalkeeper Charlee Pruitt while getting a foot onto a flick-on from senior Mandy Freeman, and the ball trickled into the net as Molen and Pruitt lay sprawled on the pitch. Andrews doubled the Trojans’ lead just before the half, putting the finishing touch on a well-executed corner.
“The chemistry has been building over the season,” Molen said. “I feel like we’ve found a groove that really works well and helps with our confidence.”
USC actually didn’t settle into a dominant offensive rhythm until the second period of play, but the Women of Troy couldn’t take advantage in the second half. Despite creating several opportunities to extend their lead even further, the Trojan offense failed to capitalize, being denied by offsides, crossbars and lackluster finishing.
“We’re still a work in progress, as much as we’re winning,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “There are still small things that we’re working on, and this was another day where we were presented a new challenge.”
Molen agreed with her coach, but she also vowed that the team would iron out the issues by its next game.
“We definitely have a few things to clean up,” she said. “But we’re going to come out on Sunday, fix what we need to fix and get that win against UNC.”
Fortunately, the Women of Troy haven’t needed a massive haul of goals to win games at the start of this season, thanks to a red-hot Sammy Jo Prudhomme in-between the sticks. The redshirt senior goalkeeper hasn’t conceded during USC’s win streak, was named Co-MVP of the Auburn Soccer Classic and earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors on Tuesday. Prudhomme was typically sure-handed in net versus LMU, though the Lions didn’t ask too many questions of her, and she recorded a single save en route to yet another clean sheet.
Prudhomme and USC face a tough test next, however, hosting No. 8 North Carolina. The Tar Heels visit McAlister Field on Sunday after playing the Bruins in Westwood on Friday, and they will look to beat USC for the second year in a row. Last year’s squad dropped a close 2-1 contest in Durham, but McAlpine will hope things will turn out differently in Los Angeles.
“We played them really well last year, and I think our players are ready for the challenge,” he said.
Molen was similarly bullish. The junior midfielder respected North Carolina’s fearsome reputation as a women’s soccer program (the Tar Heels have won 22 national championships), but she remained confident her team could deliver.
“They’re definitely a big-time team,” she said. “But we have the talent and the ability and the chemistry and the confidence to go out and get a result against them.”
Seeking a five-game winning streak, the Women of Troy will kick off against North Carolina at 1 p.m. on Sunday. The match will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.

So to address the question I’m sure many of you are asking: Yes, I work at one of the top PR fashion showrooms where we dress celebrities, including the Queen herself. No, I don’t get to keep any of the clothes. *sad face emoji* But rest assured, my job is much better than Anne Hathaway’s in The Devil Wears Prada. Now, the question you may be left asking is “how in the world did I come to be in such a position?”
I could go on about how if you put in the effort, you’ll see results, but the truth is sometimes it takes more than just “werk werk werk” to land your dream job. If you ask anyone in this town especially, they’ll tell you it’s all about who you know. I happen to be a very charismatic, “folksy” kind of chick, but if you aren’t lucky enough to have met the right person on that flight back to L.A. after Thanksgiving Break or know someone that knows someone, I’m gonna tell you how you can get your resume in the hands of the decision-maker (AKA the one that matters).
As a communication major, I learned early on that everything we do is an act of communicating. What you say, how you say it, who you say it to, and even what you’re wearing when you say it. Tip #1: Dressing the part is next to being the part – especially in industries such as fashion, music, or film where image is everything. As our workplaces become more and more casual, that doesn’t mean that your blazer should be replaced by that sweatshirt. Putting a well-dressed foot forward can get you further than you think. I can’t count how many times a compliment on an interview outfit has landed me in a conversation with the right person. Thanks, Mom, for teaching me that being over-dressed is always far better than being underdressed.
Now that you’re looking A1 on the outside, major key number two is what some would refer to as having that “je ne sais quoi.” And like Annie said, “you’re never fully dressed without a smile.” So be charismatic, be friendly, and when someone extends that “keep in touch” or “let’s get lunch” – DO IT! Simply put, people want to hire people they like. Take the time to invest in relationships, to learn from people in your classes, clubs, and industry who offer their help and then see how many of those people are willing to do you a favor when hiring time comes. The Grinch might have stolen Christmas, but he won’t be able to steal that job from you if the whole office actually likes you as a person.  
Last but certainly not least, is knowing what special sauce you bring to the burger. Maybe I’m just really hungry while writing this, but it makes perfect sense. Each of us have our strengths; you know, those things you probably list as “skills.” I didn’t end up putting together outfits for Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, or Zendaya because I would wear a paper bag to class. I have a passion for fashion so working with clothes is actually something I enjoy and am good at. Stay authentic to your interests, and a job that interests you will follow.
On the other hand, know what you can’t or more accurately won’t do. We all want to get our checks up, but being taken advantage of is not worth the coin. I’m not saying you won’t have to make a few coffee runs before becoming CEO, but actually read your contract, know what your time is worth, and realize that just because you might be the “lowest on the totem pole” doesn’t mean you can’t say “no.” I’ve had my fair share of jobs where I was the new girl and got walked all over, but I’ve learned that standing up for yourself makes for better opportunities and also shows that you are a boss no matter what your actual job title is. So, put some respecK on your name.
I’ll leave you with one more key to success: The only side chick you should have is one named hustle.

Many people consider oatmeal to be a breakfast staple – and it should be, since it is so simple to make and actually pretty healthy for you. Filled with calcium, potassium and fiber, another benefit of oatmeal is that it will fill you up. Oats are complex carbohydrates so the body spends a longer time breaking them down, which in turn leaves you satisfied and fuller for longer. The only problem some people find with this excellent breakfast? Plain oats can be a little boring. For that reason, I’m going to list four delicious recipes that you can use to upgrade a regular bowl of oatmeal.

Ingredients: 
Directions: 
In medium saucepan, bring milk and salt right to the verge of boiling. Slowly, stir in oats, cranberries and maple syrup. After a minute, reduce heat to medium-low. Cook for an additional minute (using quick oats) or 5 more minutes (using Old Fashioned oats). Stir often. When the milk is nearly all absorbed, remove oats from heat and cover. Let stand for 3 minutes then stir in the wheat germ. Serve with additional maple syrup.

Directions: Put oats, water, milk, salt, and Splenda in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat for 1-2 minutes. Remove from microwave and stir. Heat for additional 30-second intervals, stirring after each one, until thickened as desired. Sprinkle with cinnamon.
