Back when people actually watched Gossip Girl, the question often posed was: Are you a Blair or a Serena?
Most girls said Serena, and why wouldn’t they? Serena is tall with a bubbly, spit-fire personality, whose golden locks fall so perfectly down her size four body.
I, however, was always a Blair fan. Not because she had an insane wardrobe or somehow brought headbands back into style. No, Blair was the favorite because the girl playing her managed to take a one-dimensional character and make her real.
Blake Lively is a lot of things: stunning, funny and obviously charming if she calls Christian Louboutin one of her best friends and Ryan Reynolds her boyfriend. One thing she is not, however, is a good actress. No matter what the part is, Lively seems to literally pick up what has been given to her and smash it into the ground into tiny little pieces.
Her role on Gossip Girl as Serena is easy work: pout here, smile there, look pretty in a $4,000 dress while traveling around the city. It’s not that Lively does a bad job, it’s just that she does no job. In life, she is Serena van der Woodsen: a girl who has skirted responsibility and has had lots of luck in life because of how attractive she is. Leighton Meester (Blair), on the other hand, actually had to act.
Meester hasn’t been getting a lot of press lately. She attempted to make an album – her voice is actually pretty decent. She also has taken a bunch of supporting roles in comedies like Date Night (2010) and Going the Distance (2010).  She also starred as the roommate-from-hell in The Roommate (2011). But for some reason, Meester isn’t getting the attention she deserves.
And who is? Lively. She has been on every red carpet known to man, rocking designs sent to her personally. She seems to be racking up the film roles and some of the films have been good; but for every The Town (2010), there’s a Green Lantern (2011).
Next up for Lively? The Oliver Stone film, Savages, is set for release this coming July, and while on paper, the film may sound intriguing: two drug dealers go on a violent rampage to get back their shared girlfriend from a Mexican drug cartel, the trailer itself is just a hot mess, and Lively’s the worst part.
Seriously, I don’t know if she rocks her auditions and then just fails the actual movie miserably, but this girl somehow gets amazing parts and just slaughters them. The trailer of Savages shows her having a grand ol’ time being sexy and carefree with two guys, even her voiceover tells us so.
Perhaps I’m wrong and Savages will turn out to be a critical masterpiece. From the looks of things though, it seems as if Lively will continue skirting by her looks for the rest of her career.
I agree with this article. It is also true that even though Leighton can act better than Blake, Blake gets better roles. Maybe its because of her body. lol.
Also, that’s the wrong link to another movie called The Savages a few years back.
Here’s the correct one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIPpdEjORas&feature=related
I love how this article is in the Daily Trojan lol. I would have expected this type of article to be on a tabloid website but it’s amusing. Not quite sure why there’s so much antagonism against this article really. 
I see what the author is saying and I do agree with her overall view. She probably could have compared the two actresses better in order to get a more rounded, persuasive article but it’s just a blog piece. 
On Gossip Girl where they both had breakout roles, Leighton’s character Blair Waldorf has more depth than Lively’s one-dimensional character. As for acting, Lively has not proven herself yet as an actress, only as a really good-looking actor who dresses well. Meester has done more supporting roles in different genres and has branched herself out more, and is now veering towards comedy now which is interesting. Only time will tell who is really more talented because they both have not done that much work yet.
Spit an actress to support the other is a bad way to be a critic. From your column I see that you saw only the two mentioned  films which starred Blake Lively, even on that  basis  you bring a conclusion. Other movies are not even mentioned, and Blake Lively in them played a very demanding role. You are not remembered – The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 1 and 2, Elvis and Anabelle, The Private Lives of Pippa Lee and Accepted (for which she received an award Holliwood Lifes Breakthrough Award). If you were a real critic would be fair to both actresses, because they are very talented and promising. If you look a little better TV series Gossip Girl you would see that these two are good colleagues and friends who work together for 5 years.
I can’t believe this was written by a university student.  Whomever is financing your education is wasting their money. You don’t know Meester or Lively personally, and neither has a huge body of work for you to make such definitive judgments about them as people or extent of their abilities as actors. But if you’re such fan of Leighton’s, why don’t you spend your precious time and space talking about HER? Your need to slag another actress for an entire column to prop up your favorite doesn’t exactly inspire confidence in your opinion.

In that awkward gap between early spring singles and summer hits, music lovers idly scroll through their played-out playlists and repeatedly visit download sites to find a hot track that will carry them over to the next phase of 2012 music.
But maybe listeners are looking in the wrong place. As summer anthems draw towards us, maybe we should be looking to the past for a something fresh to listen to. After all, many of the top artists of today are highly influenced by the music icons of ten or twenty years ago. And who knows? You might even find some of these in your parent’s record collection, saving you a bit of extra cash.
1. Whitney Houston by Whitney Houston (1985)
Though the singer’s death has earned some of her older tracks some extra radio time, Whitney Houston still warrants another listen. Inspired by her icons Chaka Khan and Gladys Knight, Houston pours out her soul on her debut album in famous ballads like “You Give Good Love” and “The Greatest Love of All.” But even if you’re looking for something a little more up-tempo, songs like “Someone for Me” and “How Will I Know” are sure to get your heart pumping.
2. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill by Lauryn Hill (1998)
Though this one might seem a bit obvious to die-hard hip-hop fans, it still remains a legendary contribution to the genre. With tracks like “I Used to Love Him,” “Doo Wop (That Thing)” and the ever-popular “Can’t Take My Eyes Off of You,” The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, the debut solo album of the title artist, solidified Lauryn Hill’s place in the music world and still harbors a startling relevancy for issues in urban life.
3. Songs for Young Lovers by Frank Sinatra (1954)
Need a little extra romance and sick of Rihanna’s “We Found Love?” Turn back to one of the original Casanovas. Sinatra’s slick, seductive vocals in songs like “My Funny Valentine” and “I Get a Kick out of You” provide a refreshing alternative to modern, blatant sexual lyrics. In addition, characteristic witty lyrics and endearing charm make this member of the Rat Pack worthy of a comeback.
4. Nevermind by Nirvana (1991)
Everyone probably recognizes the 90s, head banging track “Smells like Teen Spirit,” but Nirvana’s Nevermind has a lot more to offer than proto-indie music. One of the first rock albums to popularize grunge music and revert back to the sixties era of discussing political and social issues, Nevermind features hidden tracks like “Drain You,” “Polly” and “Something in the Way,” which show a maturity to a band overshadowed by lead singer Kurt Cobain’s death.

On the heels of four straight shutout victories, the USC women’s tennis team (16-2, 5-0) looks to finish strong in its final homestand of the regular season against Arizona (12-6, 2-3) on Friday followed by Arizona State on Saturday (10-5, 2-3).
Ranked No. 4 in the nation despite seven straight victories, USC is looking to build off of their recent success after dominating the Pac-12 so far this season. Before the Women of Troy look ahead to an arduos road schedule to end the year, they first have to deal with two hungry conference rivals looking to play the underdog role to perfection at Marks Stadium this weekend.
Arizona will rely heavily on their top two players this Friday as senior Natasha Marks an sophomore Lacey Smyth rank 66th and 81st nationally in singles and also combine to be a fearsome top-50 doubles squad as well.
The Wildcats are looking for revenge on USC, who wiped the floor with Arizona in their last meeting during a 7-0 drubbing in 2010 and had to forfeit their Pac-12 match last season. Overall, USC leads the all-time series 45-15, but the Wildcats aren’t looking to even the series just yet as they set their sights on ending USC’s current winning streak.
On Saturday, the Women of Troy take on the 29th-ranked Sun Devils, who come in on a two-game slide after being beaten by California and Stanford in back-to-back shutouts. Arizona State boasts one of the top singles players in the nation in No. 9 Jacqueline Cako as she poses a serious threat on court one against freshman Zoe Scandalis after defeating her in ASU’s only win in a 6-1 loss to USC earlier this season.
On the doubles side, Cako and Joanna Smith form a competitive duo that is currently ranked No. 56 in the nation.
For the Women of Troy to be successful, they have to start strong out of the gates, which has been an important part of their recent seven-game winning streak along with a fairly weak Pac-12 schedule. Earlier in the season, USC had a difficult time against quality teams because they would put themselves in a hole after losing the doubles point.
Now, though, the Women of Troy have been able to save energy normally wasted on coming back in matches and focus that on closing out victories.
Freshmen like Sabrina Santamaria, Gabriella DeSimone, and Scandais have shown maturity throughout the year and it’ll be interesting to note how they — and the rest of the Women of Troy — handle the wear and tear of a tough schedule both mentally and physically.
I happen to know based on the season, players, and some of the language (doubles, Marks Stadium), but the word Tennis doesn’t appear a single time anywhere in this article. The Women of Troy is the name for ALL Women’s Athletics–How do I know this article isn’t about… Soccer? or Sand Volleyball?
