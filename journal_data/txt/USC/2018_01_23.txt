Art museums are my happy place. Growing up a 40-minute Metro ride away from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., I spent my childhood frequenting the hallowed hallways of Renwick Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery and Hirshhorn Museum.
Everytime I visit a new city, I make it a priority to explore its most famed art museums. Since moving to Los Angeles, I have worked my way through Museum of Contemporary Art, Hauser & Wirth and The Broad. Unsurprisingly, when I studied abroad in Paris, I shamelessly abused my European student discount: I made monthly trips to The Louvre and the Centre Pompidou and designated weekends for expeditions to the Espace Dalí and other niche exhibitions scattered throughout Montmartre. For the love of Magritte, I even booked a solo day trip to Brussels and spent hours exploring all three levels of his museum. 
Even before I started writing, I was making art. I took art classes throughout my childhood and wished for art supplies (along with books, of course) for every birthday and Christmas. In fact, in middle school, I was slated to win art competitions under the tutelage of a certifiably unhinged and racist art teacher before I severed ties with her for obvious reasons — but that’s a story for another column. Now, the bulk of my art-making comprises absent-minded scribbles in my notebooks while sinking into deep stupors during lectures where technology is banned, painting landscapes for the house commissioned by my mother and recreating my boyfriend’s favorite album covers as gifts for him. 
Although I don’t consider myself a fine artist, art has always played a crucial role in my life — it dictates how I choose to spend my free time, influenced my decision to minor in visual culture and governs the perceptions of others and myself.
But what I love most about the art world is that it is a host of culture and a microcosm of society at large. In studying art, we examine history, philosophy and humanity itself by extension. In all its cliched glory, here’s a truth I hold to be self-evident: Art, in all its forms, is the purest possible contour of human expression. 
Most importantly, my passion for visual culture has taught me to see everything around me as art. Now, if you’ll bear with my self-aggrandizing pretension, I’ll exemplify my point through the lens of a rather famous urinal. Yes, you read that right. 
Art by Effren Villanueva | Daily Trojan
In 1917, Parisian painter Marcel Duchamp famously pioneered the conceptual artistic movement of the “readymade” by displaying a piece named Fountain — a porcelain urinal signed with the moniker “R. Mutt” and re-oriented on its side. His intent was to introduce the notion that everyday objects hold endless manifestations of meaning and that they can be considered art through the simple gesture of declaring that they are. In other words, the very act of authoring and titling the urinal as something other than its original function rendered it an authentic work by Duchamp. 
According to Duchamp and his followers, art is a feat of both ownership and readership. He’s not saying that every object can be worth millions, but that if, as an artist, you decide that your desk lamp is art and an artistic institution agrees to showcase it, your desk lamp would effectively become art. In the same vein, as a writer at the Daily Trojan as a publication, my column becomes legitimized as journalism. 
Duchamp also meant to humanize the artist and the art world by demoting the idea of art into something that is readily available to the public — in a literal sense, art is something the masses piss on daily. Naturally, he received backlash from culture critics who argued he was neither exciting nor ennobling. But the statement Duchamp made with Fountain was still revolutionary. The piece shifted the focus of art from physical form to intellectual interpretation and created original thought from an ordinary object. In essence, it made us all artists. 
Even more broadly, the lesson I take from the concept of the readymade is that I have the power to be anything I want and the agency to see the world around me however I want. Duchamp also taught me to challenge the status quo; he defied all existing definitions of art and dawned a postmodern era in which the very idea of something can be art. 
Now, when I wander through a contemporary art gallery and see little more than a chair or a spray-painted cot or a fort of cardboard boxes, I know that it is art because someone chose to believe it. Now, there’s no one to tell me how or how not to think critically. I don’t worry that my writing is subpar; I know it is not because the thought and attention that I pour into it already holds immeasurable power.
And, at the very least, if my projected career path doesn’t work out, I can always loot a public restroom and sell the porcelain portions to art museums.

Rock band Fall Out Boy released their seventh studio album MANIA on Jan. 19, three years after 2015’s American Beauty / American Psycho.
The term “rock” band is being used quite loosely here, which is ironic because it was only 2013 when Fall Out Boy wanted to Save Rock and Roll on their fifth studio album. The band has toned down their rockin’ roots, and adopted a more alternative rock electronica fusion-styled sound (including sampling and featuring rappers like Big Sean on their LP). But with MANIA, the band has all but abandoned rock and roll.
Despite the stylistic change, Fall Out Boy’s typical thematic content has not been lost. The questioning of place, purpose and fate, and themes of love and loneliness are evident throughout MANIA, though these themes are  undermined by the over-involved production, distracting synthesizers and other computer-generated sounds. 
Had the album utilized real instrumentals, the deeply human messages would certainly have had stronger resonance. Attempts at empowering and inspirational lyrics lack strength or depth because they are too surface-level and repetitive, such as on “Champion” — “If I can live through this / if I can live through this / if I can live through this / and I can do anything.” 
 The message in  the chorus of “Stay Frosty Royal Milk Tea” is no different; lead singer Patrick Stump can think of nothing more than “The only thing that’s ever stopping me is me, hey!” 
Still, the song is the highlight of the album,  and sounds like the most traditional Fall Out Boy with it’s heavy rock and roll influence. With the exception of the aforementioned chorus, the song has the most complex and distinct message of all the songs of MANIA, expressing a frustration with the present day. However,  this sentiment is not presented in the most straightforward way with lines like, “Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind / And all of my childhood heroes have fallen off or died” and “Even at the best of times I’m out of my mind / You only get what you grieve.”
Fall Out Boy’s seventh studio album MANIA relies heavily on technological elements such as synthesisers and other computer-generated sounds, marking an emphatic departure from its rock and roll roots. Photo courtesy of Island Records.
Over time, the contents of Fall Out Boy’s musical catalogue the song titles and lengths have gotten shorter and shorter. The longest song on MANIA is the finale “Bishop’s Knife Trick” at 4:23; and the shortest, “Stay Frosty Milk Tea,” fails to reach even the three minute mark, clocking in at 2:50. With a total run time of 35:46, MANIA heavily relied on vocal riffs and repetition of words and phrases to fill the time. 
Despite its lack of depth, the strongest single released ahead of the album is “Champion,” as it showcases Fall Out Boy’s shift in perspective since their previous albums. It explores the complications of success and failure, and overcoming obstacles. This song in particular is sort of a melancholic, new take on “Centuries” from American Beauty / American Psycho. 
Fall Out Boy has grown up from their boyish dreams, and seen the reality of things. “Centuries” was about having big dreams, while on “Champion,” the same dreams have been realized but aren’t all they were cracked it up to be.
With regards to the production, Fall Out Boy’s reliance on technology renders them somewhat hard to distinguish from other artists, as it blends in with the popular sound of today. Certain songs sound nearly identical to Top 40 hits. “HOLD ME TIGHT OR DON’T” sounds like  Calvin Harris’ “Feels,”  and “Heaven’s Gate” mimics Rihanna’s “Love on the Brain.” A common critique with many artists is that the more mainstream they are, the worse their music becomes, and Fall Out Boy is no exception.
MANIA is to Fall Out Boy as 1989 was to Taylor Swift. It’s difficult to say whether fans will be disappointed or not with Fall Out Boy’s style. Some “progressives” might embrace the band’s electronica influences, while“purists” may pine for the rockin’ Fall Out Boy of the early 2000s.

When author Gerrick Kennedy set out to chronicle the remarkable N.W.A. timeline in his new book Parental Discretion is Advised, he had a mission — a mission that only intensified after seeing their story told in the 2015 movie Straight Outta Compton.
Gerrick Kennedy, a journalist with the Los Angeles Times, was inspired to dig deeper and write a book looking into the history of the N.W.A. after watching the film Straight Outta Compton. Photo courtesy of Andres Tardio.
“If you really watch that film, it’s based off three songs, which are their most famous songs,” Kennedy said. “It’s something I definitely understand, but you don’t really get an understanding of what they were about, unless you’re exploring all of the music.”
After over a decade of experience covering the world of music, telling stories that are often overlooked is nothing new to Kennedy. When he first arrived at the Los Angeles Times in 2009, coverage of hip-hop and R&B was limited to artists with mainstream notoriety, allowing him to put his natural interest in the genre to good use. 
“I was able to use the fact that I knew these genres really well,” Kennedy said. “I could see what could be next, or what I was enjoying.”
So while penning Parental Discretion is Advised, Kennedy made sure to focus on the social implications of N.W.A.’s music and what they stood for, seeing it as the relatively ignored part of how their story was told. Unlike the process of writing articles to be published in media outlets, the standalone nature of the book allowed for increased room for commentary, something his book editor initially had to remind him of as a first-time author. 
“[There are] certain things that I stand for, where I can’t allow my name to be attached to this book, and not do a retrospective look at certain things,” Kennedy said. “First and foremost I wanted to honor the legacy, but there are things about them that are hard to overlook, like ‘here’s the story,’ and then you breeze by it. As someone who sometimes criticizes, that’s just impossible for me to do.”
Along with that, giving a voice to those often left out of the N.W.A. narrative was a priority for Kennedy, influencing the list of people he chose to interview. By striving to discover how member Eazy-E was as a parent through interviews with his children, he was able to obtain a more complete picture of the rapper, consequently changing how he viewed him and his career.
“I realized that Eazy was smarter than we’ve always given him credit for. I didn’t understand how hurt he was by Dre and Cube leaving,” Kennedy said. “You always saw the negative comments and little jabs, but it was still a brotherhood. Once you got into the heart of that, some opinions I had softened up a bit.”
As a journalist himself, Kennedy was especially familiar with how the media portrayed N.W.A. while the group was recording music. In hindsight, it’s easier to see the subtle racism that lay hidden in many of the questions N.W.A. received, but Kennedy believes that at the time, many writers and reporters were unaware of the damage they were doing in the way they spoke about the rappers and their hometown.
“You can see the attitude, you can see some writers chomping at the bit to write really harsh things about who they were and where they came from,” Kennedy said. “You would see these stories like, ‘Oh, what’s Compton?’ like it’s this ghetto spot in L.A., and treating it like it’s this fantasy place with nothing but just violence. There was this tone with a lot of major publications, it’s crazy.”
Rapper Ice Cube terms rock and roll as “a spirit” rather than a genre at one point in Parental Discretion is Advised, arguing that N.W.A.’s rebellious spirit aligned them more with famous rockstars of previous generations than many would have liked to admit. Kennedy noted how apparent this was in the coverage of the group, although journalists still couldn’t realize how their depictions and angles were pushing history to repeat itself. 
“There was one story where they sent the writer to an N.W.A. show to talk to as many non-black people as they can, about why they like the music,” Kennedy said. “And then you’ll get these quotes from like, Becky Sue, that’s saying, ‘I like it because my dad hates that I like it.’ She doesn’t even like the music at all, but she likes the fact that she’s pissing off her dad. So it was interesting that the writers couldn’t even see that it was the same stuff that had happened with rock, with the Sex Pistols and these other groups, but they still weren’t having it.”
Now less than two months removed from the book’s release date, Kennedy is thrilled to be finished with the exhausting undertaking. From idea to the bookshelves, the entire process took over 30 months, and Kennedy still remembers how drained he was upon completing the first draft.
“It was New Year’s Eve, and I was done two days before the deadline,” Kennedy said with a laugh. “I hadn’t slept in three days, so I took a nap, and when I woke up it was 11:45. I realized I was washed, so I went to the store and bought a six-pack of beer, came home, drank it all by myself and went back to sleep until like 2 the next day.”
Still, the book writing process is something he hopes to do again, ideally with more uninterrupted access to his subjects. 
“Knowing how this process works, those things would be really cool,” Kennedy said. “To have the person that you’re writing about be disposable whenever you want, I feel like that could be really nice.”

On Friday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the site will begin surveying users to determine “trustworthy, informative and local” news sources to highlight on news feeds. Last week, Zuckerberg also stated how the platform will begin emphasizing more personal interactions on the feed, decreasing the focus on news, branded content and video. 
Although the shift in Facebook’s content strategy appears user-focused, it hints at the problems the site has faced in recent years: an overwhelming focus on sponsored content, with pitfalls in preventing the spread of fake news during the 2016 election cycle. 
As Facebook attempts to fix itself algorithmically to curate the content users engage in, it must recognize its past failures — that is, complacently allowing misinformation to spread at the expense of maintaining a neutral front to keep users and advertisers alike.
Facebook should not rely solely on community responses to select trustworthy content to boost on users’ feeds, although Zuckerberg explains that as the most “objective” decision. From Zuckerberg’s post calling for users to rank media credibility, it appears he is removing Facebook’s curation responsibility and transferring this power to users instead. For better or for worse, media organizations and publishers will soon experience the impact of this change.
Yet, as Facebook takes a step back and allows users to decide for themselves which news providers they want to see more of, Zuckerberg’s statement neglects what studies have shown about news consumer habits, especially in a polarizing political atmosphere. 
According to a 2015 study by Facebook researchers, users tend to selectively create echo chambers with others who share their views online – both as a result of the site’s algorithm and out of pure choice. In hindsight, these chambers have been effectively targeted by Russian-sponsored ads to further polarize users during the 2016 election.
“[The update] will only shift the balance of news you see towards sources that are determined to be trusted by the community,” Zuckerberg wrote. 
However, there is a difference between trust and truth, and Zuckerberg’s statement alludes to the site’s potential compromise on objective truth to appease its users. What if a user trusts information from a source that is objectively not true?
Forty-three percent of Americans have a negative perspective of the news, according to a 2017 Gallup and Knight Foundation Survey, and a majority can’t name an objective news source. 
And for journalists, would that mean the notion of fair, impartial reporting becomes compromised if one’s organization is not deemed trustworthy enough by the public? A 2014 Pew Research study shows that Buzzfeed News is distrusted as a news source by both liberals and conservatives; yet, the organization was a 2017 Pulitzer Prize finalist in international reporting. 
Facebook’s news feed shift could prove detrimental to newer, non-traditional media outlets seeking to develop an audience base on the platform.
Although media organizations should take responsibility for restoring the disparity between journalists and the public, social networks play a crucial role in improving and repairing that relationship — 67 percent of Americans get their news from social media. 
The concept of the “marketplace of ideas” remains critical to American democracy, yet social media has altered the pace at which users interact and share ideas. Users are now more likely to trust content shared by a trusted individual, even if the article is from an unknown media outlet, according to research by the Media Insight Project.
As publishers and brands seek to assimilate to the changing digital landscape, Facebook has become a platform suited for mass engagement and connection between journalists and individuals. 
It’s a delicate balance Facebook needs to strive for: presenting users with accurate, truthful information while not restricting them to content selected by the general community.

Academic freedom is a foundational value of any university. Defined by a scholar’s fundamental right to express his or her ideas without fear of retaliation and punishment, freedom of expression in the university setting sets the stage for progressive thought. When we censor professors — the very people who foster that progressive thought — we hinder the academic environment. 
Recent events at USC involving international relations  professor David Kang have brought this issue to the forefront of University politics. On Oct. 26, Kang gave a presentation for an introductory class, which in part focused on terrorist organizations. Kang titled a lecture slide, “Who are terrorists?” and provided a list of nine groups who, as Kang later explained, were “called terrorists by their opponents.” This list of groups and individuals included communist leader Mao Zedong, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, the Irish Republican Army and, most notably in this case, Israeli Zionists. 
Kang’s association of Israeli Zionists with terrorism caught the attention of a student in Kang’s IR 210 class, who leaked the Powerpoint presentation to the Jewish Journal, stating he was “disturbed” by the slides. Both this student and the Jewish Journal believe that Professor Kang was promoting  anti-semitic views and was feeding the class the idea that Israeli Zionists are terrorists. A petition demanding Kang apologize and be censured for the presentation was widely shared and signed.
However, it seems more likely that Kang was trying to foster an engaging learning environment by discussing the issue of how opposing groups perceive and represent each other. Controversies are bound to emerge in classroom settings, but this should not have been a controversy.
Zionism is a political movement advocating for the national liberation and self-determination of the Jewish people. And within this movement, there have been a number of individuals and Jewish paramilitary groups that have incited violence against civilians and others who do not share their views. Most notoriously, a Zionist organization called the “Irgun” bombed the King David Hotel in 1946, killing nearly 100 people.
Of course, this does not mean that the Zionist movement as a whole is rested in terrorism, but some groups and people do in fact think of Israeli Zionists as terrorists; stating this fact of others’ perceptions of Zionism is neither false nor slanderous. Still, others may think of them as heroes. Kang posed students with this question for the sake of dialogue and to give students a glimpse of reality. 
The buzz on this issue prompted Roz Rothstein, the international director of StandWithUs, a pro-Israel organization behind a petition to have Kang explicitly condemned by the University, to declare: “USC Professor David Kang dehumanized all Israelis, Jews and others who believe in Israel’s right to exist during his lecture this past October.” 
Rothstein went on to assert that Kang’s inclusion of Israeli Zionists on his slides was a form of hate speech. It was at this point that the petition garnered a few thousand signatures of people who agreed with Rothstein. But one might guess that many of them weren’t actually in the classroom when Professor Kang presented his slide, and that their outrage was the product of unawareness of the context.
In the words of Rothstein, herself, an educator is someone who is supposed to “help students think critically about the world.” To do this, a professor must engage in intellectual debate with students. From Kang’s point of view, he was trying to do just that. He explained: “The point of the exercise was to get students to think about how and why organizations are labeled as terrorist organizations, and to foster a discussion about who does the labeling and for what purpose.” 
Kang was not saying that all Israeli Zionists are terrorists, nor was he really giving an opinion at all. Rather, he was using the example to facilitate an insightful discussion on cultural relativism and how it impacts the image of terrorism across people of different groups and backgrounds.
This is not the first time that professors have brought up controversial topics such as terrorism, and why some groups and not others are considered terrorists. It certainly won’t be the last time students are offended by material in a classroom, and students should always have the right to contest a professor or start an intellectual debate if they disagree with something. 
However, it is when we skip the process of intellectual debate and censor professors and educators that we infringe upon academic freedom and integrity. If the student in Kang’s international relations class disagreed with the information presented, then he should have voiced his concerns in class. A true academic environment cannot exist without engagement in intellectual debate, and this debate, sadly, cannot exist in its fullest and most beneficial extent if educators fear censorship or retaliation.

With a 6-2 Pac-12 record, the Men of Troy rank second. George Lydakis | Daily Trojan
The season seemed to be a lost cause. 
USC had already lost by 16 points at home against Texas A&M in November, collectively shooting 28.2 percent from the field.
In December, there was the ugly loss to Princeton in the Staples Center, when the Trojans were outscored 17-7 in overtime. 
Then, the team started conference play in subpar fashion. They dropped a game to Washington and lost a heartbreaker to Stanford one week later. The Stanford game should have been over when senior guard Jordan McLaughlin made a tightly contested layup with three seconds left. 
But then disaster struck.
The Cardinal’s Daejon Davis nailed a 3-pointer from half-court at the buzzer. It offered the perfect metaphor for a season filled with shortcoming after shortcoming for the Trojans.
Another agonizing loss, a disappointing 2-2 Pac-12 record, plus the announcement of sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton’s yearlong suspension should have indicated the season was over. Perhaps the team was vastly overrated despite all the star power returning from last year’s bracket-busting team. Perhaps the addition of Duke transfer redshirt-sophomore guard Derryck Thornton and highly-touted recruit freshman guard Charles O’Bannon Jr. were not enough to propel USC into a new elite realm. Perhaps Melton’s versatile, swiss-army-knife style of play was more integral to last year’s success than initially thought (Melton averaged 8.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 3.5 assists, and 1.9 steals in the 2016-17 season). 
But winning tends to have a way of silencing questions. 
And the Trojans have done nothing but win since their last loss to Stanford. As they prepare for an emotional rematch with the Cardinal on Wednesday, the team rides a four-game winning streak and sits at second place in the Pac-12 behind Arizona. 
A week ago, the idea of any post-season action beyond the Pac-12 Tournament seemed like just a dream. 
Well, now the tables have turned. 
Much of USC’s turnaround is a result of improved shooting at the guard position. Senior guard Elijah Stewart was the team’s primary sharpshooter in 2016-17. He led the team in 3-pointers with 78. This year, he limped into Pac-12 play, going 1-9 from long range against Washington, Cal and Stanford.
Now, Stewart has found his rhythm. 
He shot three out of four shots from deep in the Utah win on Jan. 14 and went 4-8 on 3s against Oregon State a week later. Stewart’s resurgence has taken pressure off of junior forwards Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright offensively and gives McLaughlin another option to kick out to on the wing. 
Along with Stewart’s help offensively, after the Stanford loss, head coach Andy Enfield made the decision to bench sophomore shooting guard Jonah Mathews for redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron. 
But Mathew’s benching was not a demotion. He took the sixth man role and started paying dividends immediately. 
After not making a single 3-pointer in three straight Pac-12 games, Mathews drilled six combined against Colorado and Utah, leading the team with 17 points against the Utes. Now, the Trojans can deploy a dynamic scorer on the second unit, preventing them from dropping off when McLaughlin and Stewart exit the game. 
“[Mathews] has played great basketball all week,” Enfield said after the Utah game. “It was one of his best games tonight.” 
In the beginning of the season, USC showed a lack of depth and usually struggled whenever Boatwright, Metu or Stewart struggled. Now, the team is receiving key points from the bench courtesy of both Mathews and freshman wing Jordan Usher. 
Usher finished the team’s non-conference slate, averaging 2.0 points per game, but after the four-game winning streak, he’s up to 3.9. He capped off an excellent string of games with a career-high 14-point performance against Oregon State. After all the hype surrounding O’Bannon Jr., now it seems like Usher was the true gem of the 2017 recruiting class. It looks like he could be the team’s X-factor as they head deeper into conference play. 
With the re-emergence of Stewart coupled with the improving play of Matthews and Usher, Boatwright and Metu no longer have to carry the offense on their giant shoulders — and that’s a good thing for the Trojans as they move forward. 
Metu’s points per game average has steadily increased over the last four games (17.1), but he’s been much more active as a rim protector, recording a ridiculous 12 blocks over that span. 
Meanwhile, Boatwright has been able to prioritize quality  over quantity when it comes to shots. He attempted an average of 14.6 shots against Washington, Cal and Stanford. Since the winning streak began, he’s taken 11 per game.
USC now heads into the teeth of its schedule with difficult matchups against Stanford, UCLA, No. 16 Arizona State and No. 14 Arizona. 
It’ll be a make-or-break run for the Trojans, but at least they’ve gotten hot at the right time.

The USC men’s basketball team will welcome the Stanford Cardinal to the Galen Center Wednesday night riding a four-game winning streak and a second-best 6-2 Pac-12 record. Stanford will come into their Los Angeles road trip having beaten both UCLA and USC earlier this season and with the third-best record in the Pac-12 at 5-2. 
Sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic’s aggressive play style has earned him 95 total rebounds in the 2017-18 season. George Lydakis | Daily Trojan
Head coach Andy Enfield believes that the Pac-12 is as good as it has been, but that the Trojans and their defense should be prepared for Wednesday night’s game.
“[Redshirt junior forward] Reid Travis is an all-conference type of player, we have to limit him with his isolations and keeping him off of the offensive glass,” Enfield said. “To give us a chance to win it all starts with creating turnovers and making sure to keep the ball safe. We’re ready to go, but this league is really challenging this year. Every team can beat each other on any given night and on Wednesday night we see a Stanford team that gave us our last loss.”
Stanford’s previous win over USC earlier this month came off of a half-court buzzer-beater from freshman guard Daejon Davis that nullified a last-second layup from Trojans’ senior guard Jordan McLaughlin with 1.7 seconds left. In that match, the team came back from being down 13-4 in the first half to finish it on a 43-23 run. The second half, however, belonged to the Cardinal. While junior forward Chimezie Metu and sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic combined for 11-of-13 from the field for 22 points, the rest of the Trojans scored just seven second half points off of 2-of-17 shooting. 
In response, Travis exploded for 18 points as Stanford put up 41 points, hitting 15-of-19 from within 2-point range. After going up 62-51 with 14:03 left in the second half, the Trojans scored just 14 points in the final 14 minutes, while allowing the Cardinal to put up 26 and win the game in the final moments. Just like Stanford, USC’s forwards were the highlight of the game. Led by Metu’s team-high 20 points, three blocks, three assists and five rebounds, fellow forward junior Bennie Boatwright and Rakocevic combined for 13-24 shooting from the field, 18 rebounds and 30 of USC’s 76 points.
For Rakocevic, this game is not an opportunity for revenge, but rather a chance for USC to show that they are much better than what they showed up in Palo Alto. “We’re coming after them especially because we all thought we had that first game,” Rakocevic said. “That buzzer beater obviously hurt, but I feel like we let that game go, this time that’s not going to happen. It’s all about depth, because sometimes guys are going to have off nights..”
Other than McLaughlin’s modest 16 points, seven assists and four steals on 50 percent shooting, the Trojans’ guards failed to show up in Troy’s first showdown with the Cardinal. Guards sophomore Jonah Mathews, senior Elijah Stewart, freshman Jordan Usher, redshirt junior Shaqquan Aaron and redshirt sophomore Derryck Thornton combined to hit just 3-of-17 from the field for only 10 points and three assists. Against Oregon State, however, those same guards racked up 40 points and six assists, hitting 12 of 22 shots from the field, including all 10 of USC’s 3-point shots. 
“We have a deep team, the starters have the confidence in us so that it’s not a let down when we get it,” Usher said. “When we get in, sometimes the mojo clicks extra for us and we have a special night. Our team has gotten closer throughout the year. We had some adversity at the beginning of the year, but I think we’re really hitting our stride and now we’re becoming a team that everyone thought we should be.” 
Although USC may have lost on a 3-pointer, the Trojans actually defended the deep ball better than they had nearly all season.
Besides holding Cal State Fullerton to just 10.5 percent from deep (2-19), the Trojans forced the Cardinal to hit only four of their 21 3-point attempts (19 percent) before Davis hit the game-winner. Much like how USC guards were able to hit their 3-pointers over Oregon State, the Trojans also defended the perimeter well, limiting the Beavers to just 4 of 18 from beyond the arc for a second-best 22.2 percent. 
If recent trends continue for the Trojans, USC should be able to hit the 3 offensively and prevent it defensively. For Stanford, their star junior forward Reid Travis has put up four double-doubles in Pac-12 play, including a career-high 29 points and 10 rebounds over USC just a few weeks ago. Even if Travis — who is averaging 20 points and 7.6 rebounds per game — fails to score, the Cardinal has a lethal collection of guards who can score at will. 
“We need to make it tougher for everyone on Stanford,” Mathews said. “We let them off too easy last time. Some of their ball screens, they were catching it too easy. We’re playing them at home now so we can’t let them come in here and punk us. ”
In a 79-70 victory over Washington State, Travis mustered a season-low 6 points on 1-6 shooting, while guards senior Dorian Pickens and freshman Daejon Davis combined for 43 points and nine 3-pointers. Although Pickens and fellow senior forward Michael Humphrey lead the supplementary scorers with 13.1 and 11.3 points per game, respectively, freshmen forward KZ Okpala, guard Isaac White, forward Oscar Da Silva and Davis have played meaningful minutes and provided plentiful buckets. 
While Davis has started a majority of Stanford’s games, Okpala and Da Silva have both played big roles either as starters or coming off the bench. Davis stuffed the statsheet against ASU with 13 points, three steals, eight assists and five rebounds on 40 percent shooting, a typical night for a freshman who averages 9.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.4 assists and 0.9 steals per game. Despite playing just 18 minutes in a big 86-77 win over Arizona State, Da Silva racked up 14 points, seven rebounds, a block and an assist all on a perfect 4-for-4 shooting from the floor.
White, who comes in relief, leads the team in terms of completed 3-pointers, hitting 33 of his 97 shots from downtown. With such a loaded bench, the Trojans will have to keep up their defensive intensity for 40 minutes, a strategy that Enfield emphasized during practice on Monday. 
“What has been most impressive is not just the defensive effort from our bench, but our starters as well,” Enfield said. “Our team defense is much better, it doesn’t matter who we put in the game. We have to do a better job of challenging their buzzer-beaters, but hopefully we are up enough where that won’t matter.”

Tragedy strikes in a unique way when it hits an athlete.
I never saw Tyler Hilinski play a single game for Washington State. He was a bench player when USC traveled to Pullman for its stunning Week 5 loss, and I didn’t watch his valiant effort in the Cougars’ Holiday Bowl defeat to Michigan State.
But when I heard the news of his death last week, I was almost moved to tears. The story was shocking — Hilinski, the starting quarterback for an up-and-coming D-I team, was found dead with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and a suicide note at his side.
The news spread quickly with outpourings of support and grief coming from athletes, coaches and fans across the country. Hilinski was a year older than me, described as a supportive and affectionate leader on his team. Maybe it was the shock that struck me and many other football fans so deeply, the concept that an otherwise golden star could be so deeply and secretly troubled.
But for me, the loss came with a sense of fear. Hilinski’s suicide was one in a line of similar cases in previous years. It came as a chilling reminder to those who love sports that despite our passion for the players who take the field for our teams, there is little-to-no support for these athletes when they step out of the weight room and lockers and into the rest of their lives.
In their years as college athletes, these young men and women give everything to their schools. But often, their colleges are giving little in return in the way of mental health support.
In the wake of another death, we must take time to grieve the loss of this young man. But the NCAA must also take this tragedy as a sign that things need to change — fast.
The reason that fans fall in love with sports is often that it serves as a release, an escape from real life. For a couple hours, their attention and passion are diverted into something that really, truly doesn’t affect their lives. Win or lose, life will go on, but the game can often feel bigger than a mere game.
Their team is the family they never had, a mascot and a uniform that never changes or leaves from year to year. (Unless, I guess, you’re a fan of the Rams, Chargers or Raiders. Sorry, guys.)
And even when it might be nonexistent in other aspects of a sports fan’s life, when it comes to the game, there is regularity, rule and order. There is passion, loyalty and respect. Sports make sense when many other things don’t, and even when a referee makes a bad call or a team catches a bad break, there is comfort in the self-righteous grumbling of any fan who has been wronged.
Fans and players alike experience this redemptive power of sport. Basketball probably saved my life when I was younger, one of the many reasons that it remains the most sacred sport, even as I attend a football school two time zones away from my beloved hometown team.
When I was 16, there were a lot of things falling apart in my life — I was hiding my sexuality, I fought with my parents almost every day and I could barely keep up with school. The year I turned 16 was a year that I almost didn’t survive, and when I look back, I see now that somehow, a sport kept me going.
There was a time when I dreamed of playing college ball, but by junior year of high school I was just playing to play. As a post who barely hit 5-foot-10 in my shoes, I wasn’t exactly a star, but I could rebound and defend well enough to play a decent role on my school team.
To my team, I probably didn’t seem all that invested — I didn’t hang out with my teammates off the court, and I typically prioritized grades and the school newspaper ahead of practice. But at a time when it was an effort to wake up and go to school every morning, that game gave me something I desperately needed.
Every day, basketball practice provided two hours during which I escaped everything else. For those hours, I didn’t have time to think about anything except how to front a girl four inches taller than me, or how to break a full-court press, or how to stop my lungs from aching at the end of sprint drills.
Basketball was simple and beautiful to me. And it gave my family — which was struggling with the cliched turmoil of an only child coming of age and coming out — a shared love that overcame any of our other arguments. We talked about my team and our team, the University of Kansas Jayhawks, as much as we talked about anything that winter. It was an easy topic of conversation, something we often lacked at that time. In the process, basketball saved me and my family a little bit.
I say this because I want to be clear — I don’t believe that sports, on their own, are to blame for tragedies such as the loss of Hilinski. But somehow, as we’ve built college and professional sports into goliath industries, we’ve come to ask more and more of these young athletes without asking what they need in return.
Their workouts are harder, their regiments stricter, and the stakes seem almost unbelievably high for athletes who are bigger, stronger and faster than their predecessors. Yet despite these monumental expectations, very little attention is paid to the mental health of collegiate athletes.
It almost seems illogical, especially to those of us who love these games so deeply. How can something that brings so much joy into so many lives also be the thing that ends many others? How can sport, which is supposed to be fun, which is supposed to raise young men and women to be better, stronger people, also be a force that breaks them down?
ESPN writer Kate Fagan once wrote that becoming a college athlete is “like walking through an obstacle course wearing a blindfold.” Fagan became famous in the sportswriting world several years ago, when she told the story of Madison Holleran, a star runner and Ivy League student at the University of Pennsylvania who killed herself after years of hiding her battle with mental illness.
At the time, Holleran’s death was a shock that sent waves of questions, doubt and concern throughout the country. How could this happen? But that shock soon faded as other issues took hold, and even the 2017 publication of Fagan’s book about Holleran’s life and death failed to revive the same level of discussion surrounding mental illness.
But the discussion was revived after the loss of Hilinski, in part because the quarterback’s struggles remain such a mystery to his teammates and coaches. The morning of his death, Hilinski texted his teammates to set up a throwing session later that night. He seemed enthusiastic, said head coach Mike Leach. He was someone who “would lift up others that were down.” From the outside, Leach said, there was no sign that Hilinski was struggling at all.
This would come as less of a shock if the NCAA had made a larger effort in supporting the emotional and mental health of athletes. But that’s not the case.
In January 2014, less than 25 Division I schools staffed a full-time mental health practitioner in their athletic departments. That number has grown after the NCAA GOALS (Growth, Opportunities, Aspirations and Learning of Students in College) study and program in 2016, as well as a survey in the same year, found that 39 percent of Division I athletic departments now staff mental health clinicians.
But that’s still fewer than 50 percent. This means that over 50 percent of student athletes do not have access to even one mental health resource for four of the most tumultuous and challenging years of their lives. And even at those schools where a clinician is staffed, how is one professional meant to provide support to hundreds of young athletes? At Washington State, only one counselor works with the athletes of 15 teams. There are more trainers on the sidelines of a football game than there are mental health professionals for the entire department.
There is, of course, no way to completely protect young athletes from mental illness. But there is also no reason that the starting quarterback of a Division I football team should not have the resources or the support to tackle any issue regarding mental health. While the national family of football fans should look at this as a tragic loss, the NCAA should also see it as a catalyst for change.
The NCAA must put its students first. This doesn’t mean just tossing money into a few studies, or creating a “task force” to meet at a conference once a year. If the NCAA is serious about supporting its athletes, it must implement policies that require resources to be available and encourages students to utilize them despite any previous stigma.
For those of us who support young athletes on weekends, on the field and the track and the court, we must also call for change. These young athletes are students just like any of us. They’re young, overwhelmed and afraid of the future. Over the course of college, they’ll be put through a pressure cooker of emotions with little to no experience in how to handle themselves. It’s up to all of us to give these athletes our full support, on off days and in the offseason, not just from the stands.

USC Ostrow School of Dentistry students busied themselves with taking X-rays, performing fillings and interacting with patients for nearly 15 hours a day in their mobile dentist clinic on their trip to Nicaragua, eager to keep pushing through. 
Students, faculty and volunteers visited Masaya, Nicaragua for 10 days through USC’s Dental Humanitarian Outreach Program, after months of preparation and fundraising. Photo courtesy of Kativa Strickland.
Last December, students and faculty from USC’s Dental Humanitarian Outreach Program flew to Masaya, Nicaragua to provide Nicaraguans free dental care at Las Conchitas Elementary School. The dental students set up several stations for their mobile clinic, where they interacted with patients all day.
According to faculty advisor Sunny Fereshteh, the volunteers performed around 1,400 procedures during their 10-day service trip — 500 more than last year. 
This year, the club took four more dental chairs with them on the trip than in years past, treating an additional 370 patients, she said.
“We did really well in increasing the amount of treatments we provided, but not decreasing the quality of care we’re giving and continuing that same passion for our patients,” said co-director Kativa Strickland, a third-year dental student.
Along with cleanings, fillings and extractions, students and faculty performed root canals this year for the first time on a trip.
“[We tried] to do more saving rather than just pulling,” Fereshteh said. “Our mission statement and our belief system is quality. It sounds obvious, but a lot of times people go to other countries and do certain treatments and have a tendency to pull and just take out teeth, but we work very hard to do things to save teeth.”
During the trip, third- and fourth-year students performed procedures like extractions under faculty guidance, while first- and second-year students primarily assisted upperclassmen with X-rays and charting, and aiding patients with oral hygiene instruction. 
“Even though they’re not allowed to do the actual procedures, they’re allowed to be exposed to it and have a really good learning experience,” Strickland said.
According to co-director Shivani Keshav, oral hygiene instruction is important when treating patients to ensure that dental care continues after the end of their 10-day trip. 
Throughout the visit, dental students repeatedly instructed patients on how to brush their teeth and floss daily, as well as teach the children games to develop their understanding of the importance of oral health.
“No matter what kind of treatment we do when we go there, it’s only going to actually make a difference if the patient knows how to maintain their oral health after we leave,” Keshav said.
Fereshteh said that next year, the program hopes to further develop oral hygiene instruction by sending dental students out to distribute toothbrushes and varnish fluoride. The program’s executive board prepares for the annual trip all year. Most of the preparation is focused on fundraising for the supplies and equipment needed for the trip, but the directors also work with contacts, as well as the Nicaraguan government to plan and acquire necessary approvals, Strickland said.
Although students currently pay for their own transportation for the trip, Strickland said the club will help fundraise to create a scholarship for those who cannot afford the costs. 
The opportunity to work alongside dentists in a new community is beneficial, Strickland said.
“I think continuing bringing all those different specialties is great for our patients and giving a good learning experience for our students,” she said. “It’s always fun traveling to a new place with all of our colleagues and friends and getting to take what we learn in school and put it into effect.”

When Randy Yue, a senior majoring in business administration, transferred to USC as a junior in 2017, he said he was shocked that the University did not have an environmentally-conscious business club for undergraduates.
Members of The Sustainability Project have focused on promoting their mission by forming a presence online and on social media and participating in the involvement fair. Photo courtesy of Randy Yue.
“I was surprised there wasn’t one, so I took it into my own hands to make it happen,” Yue said. 
Established last October, The Sustainability Project aims to inspire future entrepreneurs on campus to integrate environmental science and conservation efforts into their businesses. Slated to officially launch this semester, the club will work toward three objectives: promoting more environmentally conscious projects and policies on campus, educating other students about green businesses and connecting people through social activities.
“No matter where in business you are, you can always be mindful of your consumption,” Yue said. “Even if you’re not in renewable energy, you can always do something to lessen your impact. If you’re in an office, you can go paperless. If you’re in a restaurant, you could not serve certain species of fish that may be endangered.” 
According to Yue, the club’s primary goal stems from the need to educate current business majors about sustainability and make them more aware that part of their corporate responsibility is to reduce their carbon footprint. 
“One of my goals is to leave USC better off than when I first came here, and this is one way I can do that,” Yue said. “I think that starting this up and connecting these people will make our community stronger.” 
Chief marketing officer Sydney Nguyen, a junior majoring in business administration, first developed an interest in sustainability in her WRIT 340 class, which centered on corporate social responsibility. For one paper, Nguyen wrote about Tiffany & Co.’s impact on developing countries through mining and found that the company primarily mined from recycled sources and sourced from countries participating in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which guaranteed that diamonds in the company’s jewelry were “conflict-free.”
“Seeing how [Tiffany & Co.] has gone from where they were before to where they are now through the different changes that they’ve made made me really want to go on with TSP and help Randy make The Sustainability Project a strong club within USC,” Nguyen said. 
Once Yue assembled a six-person leadership team from his abridged accounting class in October, he and his fellow teammates worked on building the club from the ground up to establish its presence on campus. 
“In my eyes, you need to put some effort in, especially at the Involvement Fair,” Yue said. “The past month or two have been focused on getting the website up, getting our social media all nice and tidy and now we’re in the planning stage … and getting ready to pull out this bad boy.”
The semester will kick off with a presentation from Marshall School of Business professor of management and organization Paul Adler, the club’s advisor, on Feb. 6. Adler will be the first of a series of guest speakers the club will be hosting throughout the semester. Each speaker will elaborate on how they incorporated sustainability into their business. 
According to the group’s director of advocacy Angel Yin, a senior majoring in environmental studies, the club will be visiting Catalina Island and the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies, where students can learn more about the environment and sustainability. 
There are also plans to participate in beach cleanups and tour companies where people in the business field can teach members how they can reduce their impact on the environment. 
“Often times, all of the other environmental clubs are for the environment, but here we are really trying to really create an audience within the Marshall community,” Yin said. “They’re probably not as sustainably conscious as all of the other majors are, and definitely sustainability consulting is an up and coming field, so we just want to provide more insight into what all that means.”
Though primarily composed of business students, the club is open to all majors and both undergraduate and graduate students. The club hopes to have a ripple effect when its members graduate and carry environmental ideals with them into their trades. They believe this will lead to further advocacy and progress. 
“Right now, with all the different policies changing within the government and the environment itself changing, I feel like it’s a really important time to begin a club that really focuses on this,” Nguyen said. “Especially with green technology and green businesses occurring, we just want to expand people’s mind and make them understand that sustainability can be noticed in every single industry, not just what it was founded upon.”

A new study done at the USC Keck School of Medicine published Monday by the University College London found that the volume and thickness differences in the gray matter of multiple brain regions indicates the development of epilepsy, a neurological disorder that affects up to 1.5 percent of the world population.
Christopher Whelan, a researcher at USC Keck School of Medicine, attributed differences in thickness and volume of gray matter in the cortex and subcortical brain to epilepsy. Photo from Max Pixel.
Led by Keck researcher Christopher Whelan and UCL professor Sanjay Sisodiya, the study was conducted at the ENIGMA-Epilepsy consortium, which is headquartered at Keck. 
It marked as the largest neuroimaging study of people: Data was pooled from 24 research centers worldwide, and 2,149 people with epileptic tendencies were analyzed together for similarities and divided into four groups for researchers to identify specific differences. This overall group was compared to 1,727 participants without epilepsy.
“Some of the differences we found were so subtle they could only be detected due to the large sample size that provided us with very robust, detailed data,” Whelan told ScienceDaily.
From this sampling, researchers discovered that people with brains of reduced volume and thickness generally experienced a longer duration of epilepsy. They also found reduced gray matter thickness in parts of the cortex and reduced volume in subcortical brain regions.
According to the study, participants with epilepsy had a smaller thickness specifically in the motor cortex, which controls the body’s movement, as well as a lower volume in the right thalamus, which relays sensory and motor signals. These features have been previously associated with fewer forms of epilepsy.
“We found that structural changes are present in multiple brain regions, which informs our understanding of epilepsy as a network disorder,” Whelan said.
Idiopathic generalized epilepsies, which are known for lack of noticeable structural brain abnormalities such that neuroradiologists typically cannot see anything unusual in brain scans, were even found to have some of the same discovered patterns as standard epilepsy. 
“We have identified a common neuroanatomical signature of epilepsy, across multiple epilepsy types,” Whelan told ScienceDaily. “We found that structural changes are present in multiple brain regions, which informs our understanding of epilepsy as a network disorder.”
According to the authors, further research will be conducted to follow up on these findings. With more longitudinal and genetic studies, they hope to discover the underlying cause of these structural differences in the brains of epileptic patients.
“By identifying these patterns, we are developing a neuroanatomical map showing which brain measures are key for further studies that could improve our understanding and treatment of the epilepsies,” Sisodiya told  ScienceDaily.

A rare reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Hollywood, the Museum of Illusions on Hollywood Boulevard is a small pop-up where visitors can unleash their imagination and photography skills all at once. Replete with more than 30 murals designed to trick the eye, the museum offers plenty of opportunities for fun photographs but ultimately lacks substance.
The museum mostly comprises murals painted on the walls and floors that play with perspective and angle. The tricks easily fool a camera lens but the human eye is not taken in so easily. Catherine Yang | Daily Trojan
While promotional websites enticed patrons with the promise of immersion in various optical illusion settings, the actual museum falls short. In reality, it is a disappointing downgrade from its online marketing ploys and successful European predecessor locations. 
The museum opens with its most worthwhile exhibit, leaving the rest of the installations to pale in comparison. Just around the corner from the entrance is a box-like room with an upward slanted floor and distorted depictions of windows on the ground and walls overlooking paintings of outer space. Only by taking a photo through a designated hole in the wall is the illusion evident — people inside the room appear to be boxed in a floating vessel wide open to the cosmos. 
Past this, however, the museum is little more than a winding collection of murals on the walls and floors that are not so much illusions for the eye as they are tricks for the camera lens. The artwork is impressively detailed and exceptionally imaginative, portraying situations for visitors to place themselves in — from scaling a rock wall to surfing next to a great white shark. While many are creative and dynamic, others — such as the one of two blinged-out dogs smoking at a bartop — are more static, lack illusory appeal and are hardly worth photographing. 
Photos on the walls adjacent to the murals portray examples of how visitors should pose and at what angle to take pictures in order to replicate the intended illusion. One mural portraying President Donald Trump being knocked out during a boxing match comes with a set of boxing gloves as a prop so visitors can pretend to throw a punch at him. Another mural is accompanied with an umbrella identical to the one the man depicted is carrying, so museum-goers can pose beside him as part of the picture. 
While the museum made full use of the limited space in the small venue, the walls were still rather crowded, rendering it impossible at times to back up far enough to frame certain photos. At its peak hours, crowds within the museum make it difficult to navigate and take photos. Additionally, the visibility of piping, lights and fixtures in the ceiling detract from the realism of some murals. 
Granted, the museum staff was friendly and efficient, and the premises were extremely pristine and well-kept, considering many exhibits require patrons to heavily touch and interact with the paintings. 
Ultimately, the Museum of Illusions is overpriced; advance tickets were sold for $15 with a normal ticket priced at $25 and suggested museum parking starting at $20. Given that the entire museum can be seen in under 30 minutes and is rather lackluster, the overall experience is not worth the high cost.

The caped crusader known as Batman has been a prolific figure in pop culture since masterminds Bob Kane and Bill Finger created the DC comic in 1939. Soon after he first flew into action, Batman hit television screens across the nation.

The original Batman series, starring Adam West as the titular hero, premiered in 1966 on ABC. The program graced the TV lineup with two episodes per week, and featured some of Hollywood’s biggest names as the many villains opposite West’s Batman. 
A retrospective exhibit that pays tribute to the action-packed, often campy show debuted at the Hollywood Museum on Jan. 12. 
Fans of the series and the many iterations of the hero have plenty to appreciate: Curator Wally Winger assembled some of the most sought-after collectors’ items in a comprehensive shrine dedicated to the Dark Knight. 
The Batman exhibit features everything from action figure memorabilia and costumes to the ubiquitous Batmobile. Some of the noteworthy memorabilia include children’s toys and sets of collectors’ edition coins sporting characters from the series, as well as original scripts and rough drafts for various iconic episodes, such as  “The Spell of Tut.” Some of the memorabilia features magazine advertisements for the “Batman lemon drink” — basically just lemonade — and a Batman color photo trading set. Also showcased was critic Bill Adler’s “Funniest Fan Letters to Batman.” 
The piece de resistance of the exhibit is the infamous 1966 Batmobile. According to the displayed description, the vehicle took three weeks to build, weighed 5,500 pounds and was valued at $155,000 at the time it was made. The exhibit features not only the Batmobile, but also the Batcycle used by Batman and Robin. The Harley-Davidson vehicle was originally used in the first season episode, “Not Yet, He Ain’t.”
One of the most impressive displays, however, is the room filled with the crazy, flamboyant costumes worn by the animated, eclectic group of villains that starred in the show. This display features many villains made famous by the show, such as the Riddler, the Joker, the Penguin, the Bookworm, the Mad Hatter and False Face. The gallery of villains also pays tribute to the big Hollywood names who played these roles, such as Burgess Meredith, Cesar Romero and Frank Gorshin. 
Sitting in front of each display are many different television screens all playing the series, giving a spotlight to the late West and, of course, Burt Ward as his infamous sidekick Robin. All around the room are photos of the duo in action, accompanied by the many props they used in the series, such as the Batarang. The Batman ’66 Retrospective exhibit is open through March. Student tickets are discounted at $12.

A few days ago, while watching the premiere of The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, one of my favorite arias began playing in the middle of the episode. During a sequence that pans throughout different reaction shots following the shooting of Versace, “O quante volte” from Vincenzo Bellini’s I Capuleti e i Montecchi sounds over the foreboding footage. Normally, I hate when popular media samples classical music. Chances are, the worst recording was chosen from an ample catalogue of fine artists. Surprisingly, Ryan Murphy, creator of The Assassination of Gianni Versace, got it right.
Opera has a long history of being placed in dramatic moments in movies or TV series, but having studied the art in depth, I realize that the pieces or arias that are chosen never relate to the scene itself. The thing about opera, like music in general, is that the text may be somewhat disconnected with the feeling or emotion of the melody. For example, a melancholy mood could be set to passionate texts. On the other hand, upbeat tempos may be accompanied by arduous moments. So even though an aria may sound sad, the meaning could (and probably does) have an entirely different context. 
But it’s clear that Murphy, or whoever is in charge of choosing music, did his or her homework. I’ll try my best not to give away spoilers of the episode (though in my opinion, you can’t really spoil a biopic), but the use of opera throughout is brilliant. The episode, titled “The Man Who Would be Vogue,” flashes between 1990 and 1997, the former set in San Francisco while Gianni Versace designed costumes for San Francisco Opera’s production of Richard Strauss’ Capriccio. This moment is less ominous, but deserves recognition for aesthetic accuracy. However, it’s the Bellini aria, sung by Natalie Dessay with Concerto Köln in 2007, that is the real showstopper.
 “O quante volte,” which translates literally to, “O, how much time?” comes in the second half of the first act of the Bellini masterpiece, which is based loosely on Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Giullietta (Juliet) looks at herself in the mirror in anticipation for her upcoming nuptials to another man. She dreadfully awaits the moment in which she is passed off, wishing for Romeo to visit. She begs the question: how much time until she’s saved? I’m not much of a Ryan Murphy fan, but something in the way this scene was done had me questioning my own worth. Like Giulietta, I’m getting impatient waiting to be saved. Or rather, waiting to be saved from apathy and pessimism.

When I was a young teen, my mother told me a story about when she went to a palm reader with her friends when she was in her 30s. She took everything the psychic said with a grain of salt, but she remembers vividly that the psychic told her that both her children would be very successful, especially her son (me!). Whether the palm reader actually relayed this information or my mother just told me this in an effort to get me to do my homework is unknown, but I hold the premonition close to my heart. In times of hardship or woe, my light at the end of the tunnel is actually a sound, and that sound is my mother’s voice saying, “You’re destined for success.” 
But I’m still waiting. And as I keep waiting, as I have for the last 26 years, I’m beginning to lose hope. What if that big moment has already come, but I was too busy waiting for it to pay attention? What if I’m already in my prime, and this is the best it’s ever going to get? Maybe it’s more beneficial to come to accept my accomplishments as they are, and not as a precursor for destiny.
I’m probably just being melodramatic — but I’m just taking my cues from Giulietta. She romantizes her anguish; her “sky weeps” with the “passion of desire,” and “the air that winds around” is her “longing.” Meanwhile, whenever I’m not waiting for my big break, I consume myself with fantasies of life imagined in what I consider my prime. What that even is, I’m not sure, and I don’t think I’ll be completely happy until that happens. But I’ll try to come to terms with it. Though my world revolves around realism (some would say pessimism), I’ve always been uncharacteristically optimistic about my professional life. It’s the only thing that keeps me from falling into an unmentionable abyss of regret and remorse.
If the rest of The Assassination of Gianni Versace is anything like the first episode, I’ll be watching from beginning to end. As an Italophile, I knew I’d find reasons to tune in regularly. Maybe it’s Penelope Cruz’s spot-on interpretation of fashion legend Donatella Versace. Or maybe the opportunity to see Darren Criss’ bare ass over nine weeks. Either way, it was the show’s use of music that has me inspired.
