Researchers at the Viterbi School of Engineering are developing an open-source implantable device system to treat a variety of chronic diseases by monitoring and stimulating autonomic nerves at the new $11.7 million Center for Autonomic Nerve Recording and Stimulation Systems, marking USC’s cutting-edge development of emerging bioelectronic medicine technologies.
Funded directly by the National Institute of Health’s Common Fund, the center is one of two research institutes in NIH’s Human Open Research Neural Engineering Technologies Initiative of the Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions program, co-led by Ellis Meng, Shelly and Ofer Nemirovsky chair in convergent bioscience, and two extramural researchers.
The autonomic nervous system is a part of the peripheral nervous system which controls involuntary physiologic processes like blood pressure, respiration and digestion. The implantable device system, also known as the CARSS system, will enable the therapeutic stimulation of autonomic nerves, by which doctors could collect information from patients and treat them by manipulating the communication between their nerves, organs and brain.
“The overall device is very much like … a peacemaker that has a central processing unit that picks up sensor information, but it also can provide electrical pulses to stimulate tissue,” Meng said. “From that, you can attach different connectors that each on the end of them has either a sensor, stimulating electrode, recording electrode or something else.”
In addition to the central processing unit, the CARSS system also includes an external charger and a Bluetooth controller — often a smartphone or tablet using the CARSS system software — that enables doctors to operate sensors or stimulate tissues and provide readouts for patients. 
While there are other options for doctors to manipulate nerves, the CARSS system provides patients with precise, localized treatment for a vast range of chronic conditions in a less invasive way.
“You can try to [get to nerves] from the brain … but brain surgery is not something people want to do,” Meng said. “Whereas [the CARSS system] is a simple procedure somewhere else in the body, [which is] far less invasive. That’s something that is more acceptable.”
Despite academia’s interest in developing custom therapies with implantable devices, researchers’ lack of access to relevant technologies has impeded the field. Therefore, the end results of the CARSS system will be an open-source toolkit that can be re-adjusted to suit a vast range of bioelectronic medicine applications for different users. 
“Currently, if researchers want to do something like this, they basically have to go around and beg and plead [with] companies that have existing implantable pulse generators,” Meng said. “So, the open-source part of [CARSS] is the key … All we are there to do is enable by providing a set of technologies that we think are broadly applicable.”
However, an open-source implantable device system is an unprecedented concept, and researchers hope to interact with the community of users to help improve the system during the process of the study.
“We have to understand who the community is, engage them and develop a whole communication infrastructure,” Meng said. “We want comments as we are working. Because if we don’t get that feedback early, we’ll produce something nobody wants.” 
The development of the CARSS system is a collaborative effort from five nest projects. Projects 1 and 2 are responsible for developing the central processing unit; project 3 will pursue attachments for accessing larger nerves and conducting conventional measurements; Meng leads project 4, which tackles an extremely tiny nerve for which solutions do not yet exist; project 5, spearheaded by Maral Mousavi, assistant professor of biomedical engineering, and Hangbo Zhao, assistant professor of aerospace and mechanical engineering, will design two types of sensors for the system.
Zhao is developing implantable sensors that could accurately measure organs’ physical signals, such as temperature and motion, to inform doctors about organs’ functional status. For example, the sensor could monitor the expansion and contraction of the bladder. 
“If something goes wrong, we know that we need to apply some electrical stimulation to the nervous system that controls the bladder so we can modulate the bladder movement,” Zhao said.
Mousavi said the second area of project five would be electrochemical sensing, which examines specific biomarkers and neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin levels within the environment of the peripheral nervous system. Mousavi’s team will also develop sensors that could record acetylcholine — a neurotransmitter associated with memory and learning which is particularly important in Alzheimer’s research.
Despite ongoing negotiations with NIH, the University officially opened the center at the end of September and researchers have started their projects with rosy anticipation.
“We are hoping to have these robust tools that can be put in the hands of many and to make this type of [resources], this type of studies more accessible,” Mousavi said. “What’s exciting to me is [that] we get to all work together and solve all technical problems from all different angles.”

USC’s Office of the President announced a new “major initiative” that aims to “advance human understanding in pharmaceutical sciences and biomedical engineering, and to facilitate greater integration with USC’s academic research community” in a communitywide email Thursday morning. 
The statement announced that several million dollars in endowment funds will be given to two schools — the School of Pharmacy and Viterbi School of Engineering — at the University. Alfred E. Mann — a longtime trustee and recipient of an honorary doctorate degree in 2001 — gifted USC $112.5 million in 1998 to establish the Alfred E. Mann Institute for Biomedical Engineering. Since then, the Institute’s original endowment has grown to a value of $230 million, from which the funds for the new initiative will be drawn. 
Today, the University announced four new components of the initiative — the renaming and endowing of two academic departments at USC, the creation of endowed chairs and additional funding for the USC Alfred E. Mann Institute — with more announcements to be made in the coming months. 
The School of Pharmacy will be given a $50 million endowment and will be renamed to the Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. According to a press release published by the University, the endowment will be used for “student scholarships, faculty recruitment and integrating a university-wide research infrastructure related to biomedical innovation.” 
The endowment is the largest to be given to any pharmacy school — with a subsequent renaming of said school as a result — in the state of California.
Thirty five million dollars will also be directed toward the Viterbi School of Engineering to endow and rename the biomedical engineering department to the Alfred E. Mann Department of Biomedical Engineering. 
The Viterbi endowment aims to “expand medical engineering research, attract top faculty members and strengthen its ties with the Keck School of Medicine of USC.” The donation is one of the largest gifts to a biomedical engineering department in the U.S. that will result in a name change. 
The initiative will also involve the creation of “several new endowed chairs” who will work on interdisciplinary research through USC’s Keck School of Medicine and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, as well as the newly endowed Alfred E. Mann Department of Biomedical Engineering and Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. 
An additional $80 million will be devoted to the USC Alfred E. Mann Institute, which was founded at the University in 1998. The institute “accelerates biomedical technology and creates commercially successful medical products” by supporting relevant student and faculty-led research at the University. 
President Carol Folt praised the initiative in the press release, writing “this sweeping initiative reflects Alfred Mann’s pioneering vision and has the power to expand human understanding in pharmaceutical sciences and biomedical engineering.” She also praised donors for their contributions to University research and greater public health. 
“The Mann Foundation’s generosity will enhance USC’s academic research community and our ability to educate the next generation of providers and researchers, drive scientific innovation and create commercially successful medical products that improve public health,” Folt wrote.
In the communitywide email, USC expressed its gratitude to the late Alfred E. Mann for the endowment funds and his deep ties to the University community. 
“With this initiative, USC ensures that Dr. Mann’s mission to improve daily human life will continue well into the next century,” the statement read. “There are so many opportunities before us — to benefit not just the Trojan Family, but all humankind.”

The Undergraduate Student Government senate held an emergency session on Thursday evening to approve an alternative election code for the next election cycle. The senate called the urgent session to convene after president Hannah Woodworth vetoed an original version of the election code over a change in regulations regarding USG member participation in future campaign teams. 
For the past 15 years, USG has not allowed members who hold office hours to be an official part of a USG candidate’s campaign team. In the original proposed 2022-2023 Election Code, senators included a passage that would allow “A maximum of two USG officers” to be on the same election team. 
In her statement on her veto of the original Election Code, Woodworth expressed her disapproval of the clause. 
“I fear that this change will place candidates who are not in USG at a disadvantage during the election, and create an inequitable campaign environment,” she wrote. “Given feedback we received during the election last year, indicating that USG officers are already at an inherent advantage in the election process, this change will only exacerbate the problem.”
In order to pass a new election code in time, the senate convened in an emergency session immediately preceding a meeting of USG’s legislative branch. During the session, senators debated on approving an alternate code that replaced the vetoed language with a new clause that says “no current USG Officer who holds any office hours may serve as a member of any candidate’s campaign team.” 
Debate on whether to approve the new election code lasted nearly 30 minutes of the Thursday meeting, running into the legislative branch’s meeting time. 
Senator Aidan Feighery, who opposed the president’s veto, argued that having a USG member on a campaign for someone who is currently in USG would indeed be advantageous, but not so unfairly that it would amount to conflict; USG should allow the campaigns of non-USG members to access “that institutional knowledge” by permitting teams to have a member of USG on their staff. 
Some senators proposed letting only those who do not receive stipends for their work with USG become members of campaigns, a notion which was put forward as an amendment to the new election code by senator Maria Barun.
When the senate moved into voting procedure, members moved to vote by blind ballot, which meant that all votes were cast anonymously. This motion was met with disapproval from assembly members and some senators in the meeting room, objecting that any senator planning to run in the upcoming 2022-2023 election should have recused themselves from the vote entirely. No senator elected to do so. 
The senate first voted on the amendment to the alternate Election Code, which failed, and then voted on the alternate code without the amendment attached, which also failed. After informally debating for an additional few minutes, the senate voted in favor of the alternate code, in line with the president’s original comments on election fairness.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Woodworth defended her reason to veto the original Election Code, restating her disapproval of the proposal to allow USG members to be part of election campaigns. 
“We needed to maintain a precedent to ensure that we have accessible and equitable elections,” she said. “By allowing USG members to serve on elections, it will further empower USC candidates who are on the tickets to have [an] unfair advantage and it will inherently exploit people who are outside of the organization.” 
While Woodworth said she was happy that the senate was eventually able to pass her preferred election code, she expressed disappointment that it had taken so long to do so.
“I wish that the senators had this discussion during the senate meeting when it was intended on Tuesday and that it didn’t have to be an emergency senate meeting,” she said. “I think that is inconvenient and unfair.”

At 14, I was put into a mental health institution. Although hesitant, I was relieved to know I would be getting the help I needed. While there, I discovered this was not the case. The for-profit hospital was more focused on the constant stream of patients, rather than the well-being and mental health of the patients. 
Across the United States, facilities like the one I went to have been accused of neglecting, abusing, violating and restraining children. Luckily, people have begun speaking up about their experiences and working to enact change in the industry, but it is mind-blowing that this kind of action is even necessary. Why are children receiving punishment instead of treatment? And what message does that send to kids and teens who often already struggle with self-esteem and trust issues? 
In an interactive New York Times article titled “Can You Punish A Child’s Mental Health Problems Away?” published in October 2022, a child who was treated in Texas tells a story about how she was forced to write an apology letter to her parents. It shocked me to hear this, as I was treated in a state thousands of miles away but had the same experience. I was forced to write apology letters to my parents, my best friend, my siblings and whichever “religious figure” I believed in. The message that this sends is guilt and shame. They tell you that your feelings are valid and fixable but contradictorily tell you to be ashamed of them.
One common punishment used in these institutions is restricting outside communication. It makes sense to take away personal devices and have certain visitation and call times for the patients to focus on themselves. However, what doesn’t make sense is hanging that over the patient’s head, using it as something that can be taken away at any time. I can still see the face of one of my friends in the wing when she was told she couldn’t call her parents cause she “acted out in group therapy” that day. All she had done was tear apart a styrofoam cup, using it like a fidget toy. But somehow, that was enough to cut off her communication with her parents. Keep in mind, she was legally a child, and yet was being told she couldn’t talk to her parents.
The phrase “booty juice” is known to many kids across the country who have been in a treatment facility. I never experienced it, but I watched many kids get their pants pulled down in front of everyone, publicly humiliating them and then getting stabbed in the “booty” with a needle containing a sedative (the “juice”). This was the basic response to any kid who may have been acting up. They overused it in my facility and it was more of a symbol: act up to authority and you’re getting the “booty juice.” What I didn’t realize until a few days in was that these kids weren’t getting taken back to their rooms as I had thought. They were getting taken to solitary confinement, a room that I once walked past by accident that made my stomach drop to the floor. It didn’t have a light, there was a thick lock on the door and one rectangular window facing the hallway. It was exactly what I imagine a high-level prison cell to look like, not a room for troubled children.
Speaking of prisons, probably the most dehumanizing part of this entire process is when — as a literal child — they handcuff you, put you in a straight jacket restricting all movement and throw you into the back of a police car. They tell you this is just the process of getting from the actual hospital to the treatment center, but it quite literally makes no sense. 
The most shocking thing to learn about the children and teen inpatient mental healthcare industry is the lack of oversight from the government, even though the industry generates billions of dollars in profit every year. What these treatment centers do is lure compassionate and desperate parents who want to get help for their child and market the treatment as a lifesaver. Another way they draw in profit is through understaffing the centers, therefore, “keeping returns high but creating a more dangerous environment for kids and workers.” Also, many of these workers shared in the New York Times article that they received “minimal training beyond first aid” and were “paid near minimum wage.” Children’s lives are being put into the hands of undertrained, underpaid and overworked staff. On top of this, a study done by the U.S. Department of Justice horrifyingly revealed that in 2016 alone, six children died while placed in a center. They ruled only one of those six a suicide. Six lives that were supposed to be getting better through treatment, just gone.
Even with all the numbers and stories being shared, the government has still failed to take any initiative to solve the issue at hand. Some states are starting to enact state legislation — for example, a Utah law spearheaded by survivor Paris Hilton aims to limit the use of restraint and seclusion. While some progress is being made, it is still too little. Until real reform and closure of these facilities become a reality, children and teens around the country will continue to be physically and emotionally abused, and possibly even killed. Change needs to happen, and it needs to happen now.

“Stop apologizing. You don’t need to apologize.”
Most of the time this sentiment is beyond valid, but I just can’t help but say “sorry” when something is disarrayed even when I’m tangentially involved, or not involved at all. The involuntary reaction often feels like shackles on my emotions as the words just fall out of my mouth before I can stop myself. But how did these shackles even get there?
According to The Swaddle writer Devrupa Rakshit, over-apologizing “stem[s] from a myriad of formative childhood experiences. For some, over-apologizing is a way to avoid conflict, especially if they grew up in a household where conflict sparked screaming matches, or led to violence.” Yeah, reading that hit a little hard so I thought I’d share my newfound wisdom.
My therapist doubled down on this painful truth by making me realize that part of saying sorry so much is a form of overcompensating emotionally for things out of my control. But attempting to do so through apologizing only takes more autonomy over my mentality. Suddenly, instead of just stepping in another person’s shoes, I run a marathon in them.
I’ve always seen apologies as a powerful act of empathy that can mend broken relationships as you take responsibility for your actions. Psychotherapist and author of “The Power of Apology”  Beverly Engel wrote in Psychology Today that “Apolog[ies] ha[ve] the ability to disarm others of their anger and to prevent further misunderstandings. While an apology cannot undo harmful past actions, if done sincerely and effectively, it can undo the negative effects of those actions.”
Why wouldn’t I try to undo the negative effects that are hurting my loved ones? If I care about them, how could I ignore the fact that something happened to them? Even when I recognize that the negative emotions others project onto me have nothing to do with me and more to do with them, my mind drifts to the thought that I could have done something to relieve them of that experience.
But caring for someone and apologizing are two different things. While they are not mutually exclusive, one cannot replace the other.
Whether it be from a fear of abandonment, generalized anxiety or low-self esteem, over-apologizing is often an internalized coping mechanism many form due to traumatic experiences. The act of apologizing itself is not necessarily bad; it can be difficult for a person to do when they’re admitting that they’ve messed up. Showing genuine remorse and authentically wanting to make amends is something we all should do to take responsibility for our actions. The issue arises when an apology occurs for an action that you had absolutely nothing to do with. 
Apologies aren’t magical cures for all the pain in the world. If that were the case, life would be so much easier. In apologizing to avoid conflict, it might feel like it’s the easy way out, but those emotions don’t disappear. They only grow and become more internalized — forming deep-seated, fervent roots in your mind. Taking the blame for others’ mistakes ends up repressing your own emotions to make room for someone else’s. 
It’s hard to admit, but I know that my habit of over-apologizing isn’t just because I “care too much.” It’s also a result of insecurities, abandonment issues and PTSD from various forms of abuse I endured as a child. It’s even harder to admit that this habit creates more problems for me than it solves. 
What’s the solution then? Only apologize when you’ve done something to hurt another person’s feelings, violated someone’s boundaries or if you have made a mistake. Easier said than done, right? Even as I’m writing this, I’m laughing at myself for being an absolute hypocrite. I have a habit of doing that. But this is a reminder for myself and everyone out there who is struggling with over-apologizing because it can suck the life out of you. 
So, let’s review the things we do not and should not apologize for: Things you didn’t do; things others did; things others have a problem with when you’re just existing and living your life the way you want to that isn’t harming anyone; for simply asking a question because let’s take “There’s no stupid question” seriously. From now on, I refuse to be sorry for not knowing where the goddamn bathroom is. 
Don’t apologize for your own feelings because life is hard enough. If someone has a problem with it, they can walk away. Vice versa: Don’t apologize for others’ feelings if you didn’t cause them. Too many gaslighters walk among us. Instead of apologizing, just stay vigilant for those attempting to manipulate your feelings in their favor.
And absolutely no apologizing for not having all the answers or not being able to respond right away — you’re not a dictionary or Google, and even search engines lag now and then. In summary, if you can’t control it, don’t apologize for it.
From now on, I’m only going to apologize for my own mistakes, for being so hard on myself and for taking on others’ problems when I haven’t even figured out my own. After all, you can only control yourself, so why apologize when others can’t control themselves? So, here’s one last apology for something that isn’t my fault, just to get it out of my system: I’m sorry that I’m not sorry anymore. 
Good luck, and stop apologizing.

As USC and UCLA face off with a Pac-12 Championship berth on the line, Daily Trojan sports editor Patrick Warren asks Daily Bruin sports editor Sam Settleman about UCLA’s season.
DT: What has the atmosphere been like at games? I haven’t been able to go to the Rose Bowl yet this season. And obviously there’s kind of been that narrative about, you know, the like attendance and everything. What does that look like in person?
DB: I think it looks as bad as people are making it seem like because I mean, I know The New York Times ran a recent article on the attendance woes that you say have faced the Rose Bowl this year. And that was kind of a narrative that had been pretty strong throughout much of the early games of the season. It kind of died off a little bit, not for much reason, just because UCLA had a couple games on the road and you know, the team’s winning and that masks all of the other conversation surrounding the team. But I mean, early in the season, you get those games against Bowling Green, South Alabama, Alabama State at home and 100 degree heat in August and September… Nobody’s really showing up to those games and you can’t fault them for that. 
But then you get the games against Washington on Friday night at the Rose Bowl, Utah, a ranked matchup again at the Rose Bowl and you’re not really even cracking 50,000 fans in the stadium, and that’s a pretty big disappointment. I think this is maybe the one week [wherein] that’s not really going to be the prevailing narrative, as the stands are going to be full for USC, whether that’s USC fans filling them or UCLA fans or a combination of both. So, the Rose Bowl is going to look a lot different on Saturday than it has all year. 
But yeah, that atmosphere is certainly not what it used to be even five, six years ago when Tim Moore was here and they were averaging 70,000 fans a game. And even last year, the LSU game, they got to, I think 67,000 and that atmosphere, I mean, I was in the press box for that one, that atmosphere felt totally different than any game this year has. Even when you are beating ranked teams like Washington and Utah at home, it’s a lot different when there are 45,000 people there versus, you know, 70,000 at the Rose Bowl.
DT: Talk about what, two or three months ago, your expectations were for this UCLA team and how they’ve held up as the season has gone by.
Speaker 2: I think my expectations were pretty much in line with what they did last year. They went 8-4 a season ago. And I think that surprised some people because, you know, early going into the Chip Kelly days, that was kind of out of the question; they were losing a lot of football games. It kind of showed in that [coronavirus] year that they were ready to take the next step. And they did that last year with an 8-4 record, but it wasn’t anything super impressive. I think the LSU win was probably the hallmark of that season, and that didn’t end up being much of a big win in retrospect anyway.
If you look at the schedule and it’s got three easy conference games, Washington and Utah at home, you put the Oregon game on the road as a loss, USC maybe as a loss, but I mean that was it; 9-3 was maybe the expectation just based on their schedule alone… Throughout the year, it really hasn’t changed a whole lot — I still remember the first game of the season against Bowling Green, they got a three-and-out on the first drive and got their punt blocked and returned for a touchdown and then you’re like, ‘Okay, this team isn’t going to go to 9-3 like we all thought.’ I think once they actually start winning those games that they’re expected to win, maybe you get ahead of yourself and you think, ‘Oh, this team maybe can compete for a Pac-12 Championship or [College Football Playoff].’ And that’s obviously out of the equation now, but the Pac-12 Championship is still on the table and I think that would be far exceeding any expectations I had coming into this year.
DT:A big part of those 9 or 10 wins is [quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson] , obviously. He’s a senior and he’s been there for a long time versus having this young guy in Caleb Williams; what does DTR’s leadership bring to the team as far as you can tell?
DB: I think this is probably true moreso a couple of weeks ago than it has been the last couple of weeks, but you can tell that when DTR’s playing at his best, making those highlight reel plays, when he feels confident and he’s firing up the team, it makes such a difference for that whole team and that whole offense. They really go as DTR goes for the most part, and when he’s having a game to forget and he’s missing a couple throws here and there, the offense starts to die down a little bit.
[But it’s] not only his ability on the field, but like you said, his leadership in his fifth year. He’s been in this offense for as long as anyone. Just the camaraderie with Chip and just having that relationship makes this offense kind of — I would say unstoppable, but they looked stoppable against Arizona — but for most part all year they’ve been unstoppable in all phases.
A lot of that has to do with DTR like you said. I mean, you can get it done on the ground, you can get it done through the air. There’s a reason he was legitimately in the Heisman conversation a couple weeks ago. I think he’s kind of regressed a little bit over the past couple of weeks, and he’s kind of showing that maybe this offense does need to rely on his aggression game a little more than they would have hoped. But the leadership is obviously the biggest thing that he brings to the table. I don’t know if he has the ability to be an NFL quarterback or has the talent to be a starting quarterback in the NFL, but that leadership is what’s going to lead this offense to a win.
DT: On the other side of the ball, in true Pac-12 fashion the defense [has allowed] a good bit of points this season. What are some of your concerns in guarding the Trojan offense?
DB: Yeah, everything is the answer. I think everybody talked about it coming into this year. It’s always the case with UCLA, you know, it’s not if their defense is going to be good, but is the defense going to be able to do enough to let their offense win games? 
The defense was never going to win games for them. The defensive line, you had a couple of veterans there that went down early in the year with injuries, so that’s a pretty thin group as it stands right now. Linebacker depth was a question from the get go and secondary depth, I mean, I think [sophomore defensive back] Devin Kirkwood, who’s a true sophomore now, was expected to be [the lead cornerback]… He was going to be the guy on defense that you can kind of hold your hat on — and he’s missed a couple of games of late with injury, missed some time, but he hasn’t been quite the standout that UCLA expected after a pretty solid freshman campaign. 
Beyond that, they have a couple of solid players at safety, I think that’s maybe where they’re the strongest. But the defensive line looked pretty bad against Arizona, just the inability to contain [sophomore quarterback Jayden] de Laura. And I think you get a guy like Caleb Williams with that amount of talent, a guy that can make any throw on the field, you give him any time to throw the ball. And like you said, receiver depth is a strength of USC too. So the combination of where UCLA’s defensive line is at right now and where their secondary is at right now, I don’t think stopping Caleb Willams and USC’s offense is even going to be on the table. UCLA’s offense is going to have to do the job and put up 50 points probably to get a win on Saturday, and I’m sure USC’s thinking the same from their side.
DT: So USC has kind of been bit by the injury bug. I was wondering, what are some injuries that the Bruins are concerned about heading into next week? Are there any key players that are questionable?
DB: Kirkwood, like I just said, is going to be a question mark. I think that he should be back and ready to go out. And that would be a huge loss for them if they didn’t have him. Other than that, [senior running back Zach] Charbonnet missed the game against Arizona State [which was] kind of unexpected, but he’s going to be back in the fold most likely. I mean, he played against Arizona, so he should be fine. 
For the most part, they’re healthy in terms of recent injuries. The only big question mark, I would say, is [redshirt junior wide receiver] Kazmeir  Allen, who’s been like a home run hitter for this team. He’s a guy that can hit the 75 yard play on offense and get a spark going, and he showed that against USC a season ago. He missed the Arizona game this weekend. He should be back out there, I don’t think it’s anything major [from what] it sounded like. But if he’s not, that’s going to be a huge loss for UCLA.
DT: I’ll end it as you end [my Q&A]. What is your score prediction?DB: I’m probably gonna change this, like, three more times throughout the week, but I’m going to go with 49-42 UCLA. I know I said UCLA needed 50 to win, but I’ll give them 49 and maybe they can get a win out of that.

The latest installment of the storied history between the Trojans and Bruins is upon us. Over the years, the matchup has provided fans with many memorable moments. With another installment set to take place on Saturday, here are the top five moments in the history of meetings between the two schools.
Reggie Bush rushes for 260 yards, USC beats UCLA 66-19
Although USC’s victories were vacated in the 2005 season, the matchup between USC and UCLA featured the No. 1 Trojans against the No. 11 Bruins in a game in which USC’s offensive dominance was on full display. USC scored its second highest point total of the season with 66 and was led by the dominant play of quarterback Matt Leinart and running back Reggie Bush. Leinart threw for 233 yards and 3 touchdown passes and Bush ran for 260 yards and scored 2 rushing touchdowns.
Bush’s 260 yard performance came in a season in which he ran for 1,740 yards and 16 touchdowns. Bush’s performance against the Bruins was the second time he rushed for over 200 yards in the 2005 season and one of eight games in which he ran for at least 100 yards. Leinart finished the regular season with 3,450 yards passing and 27 touchdowns with a 158.3 passer rating. USC finished the season with a 12-1 record. 
Unranked UCLA stuns No. 2 USC in 13-9 upset victory
One year after UCLA suffered a 66-19 loss at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Bruins returned the favor to the Trojans in the 2006 season. USC came into the game at the Rose Bowl with a 10-1 record on the season, with their only loss coming against the Oregon State Beavers. UCLA got their revenge on USC by holding them to a season low for points scored in a 13-9 victory.
The Trojans’ only score was a rushing touchdown by running back C.J. Gable. The win snapped the Bruins’ seven-game losing streak against USC and ensured that the Trojans would not make an appearance in the Bowl Championship Series title game that season.
USC shuts out UCLA 50-0
The Trojans entered 2011’s matchup against the Bruins having won four straight clashes. USC not only won, but won in a shutout. USC scored 50 points as quarterback Matt Barkley put up his second-highest passing yardage total of that season with 423. It was also the second time in the 2011 season Barkley threw 6 touchdown passes. Barkley finished the regular season with 3,528 passing yards and 39 touchdown passes.
Wide receiver Marqise Lee had a season high 224 yards, ending his season with 73 receptions for 1,143 yards and 11 touchdowns. Wide receiver Robert Woods’ 12 receptions on the day helped him set the conference single-season receptions record, finishing the game with 113 yards and 2 touchdowns. USC outgained UCLA in yards as the Trojans had 572 yards of offense compared to the Bruins’ 385.
Pete Carroll’s first victory over UCLA as Head Coach
In the 2001 season, USC started 1-4 under first year Head Coach Pete Carroll, but went on to finish the regular season winning five of their last six games. The last victory of the season for the Trojans was a 27-0 shutout over the Bruins, wherein quarterback Carson Palmer threw for 180 yards and one touchdown and USC’s defense forced 3 turnovers.
USC held quarterback Cory Paus to just 45 passing yards and 2 interceptions. After Paus was pulled by UCLA, USC’s defense also forced a third interception against backup quarterback Scott McEwan. Carroll’s first victory over the Bruins was a sign of things to come as USC finished the 2002 season with an overall 11-2 record and victory over Iowa in the FedEx Orange Bowl. Following that season, the Trojans would go on to win consecutive national championships in 2003 and 2004.
No. 1 UCLA Bruins and No. 2 USC Trojans face off in “The Game of the Century”
In the 1967 matchup between the Trojans and Bruins, a lot was at stake between the two teams. UCLA quarterback Gary Beban and USC running back O.J. Simpson were No. 1 and No. 2 in the race for the Heisman Trophy and the game certainly lived up to the hype. The Trojans won 21-20 in comeback fashion. Beban finished the game with 301 passing yards, and Simpson finished the game with 30 carries for 177 yards and 2 touchdowns. 
Following the game, USC went on to beat the No. 4 Big Ten Champion Indiana Hoosiers in the 1968 Rose Bowl. Simpson, however, came up short in his Heisman campaign, as Beban won the award.

As Head Coach Lincoln Riley’s first season at USC nears its close, there is only one team standing between the Trojans and their first shot at a Pac-12 Championship since 2020: the UCLA Bruins.
With a 7-1 record in the Pac-12, a win against UCLA Saturday would send the Trojans to Las Vegas for a chance to face either Washington, Oregon or Utah depending on the way things shake out in their respective matchups.
UCLA did not look like a team that would be competing for a Pac-12 title to start the season. The Bruins needed a game-winning field goal to avoid an upset from South Alabama — not exactly an FBS powerhouse. But the Bruins flipped the narrative after handily defeating Utah 42-32 — a team that beat USC 43-42 in Salt Lake City in early October.
The Bruins climbed to a No. 9 ranking in the AP Poll at one point in the season, but losses to Oregon and Arizona bumped UCLA down to No. 16 in the College Football Playoff committee’s latest rankings.
The loss to Arizona, a team that USC beat by just 8 points earlier this season, came as a surprise to many. The Bruins were a 19.5-point favorite over Arizona, but their defense which has allowed an average of 30.7 points per game could not keep the Wildcats out of the end zone. 
With the high stakes of the Pac-12 season coming to a close at an intersection with a historic rivalry, Riley’s Trojans are looking to stay focused on their gameplan.
“There’s a lot of emotion and intensity and excitement in these games and that’s what makes them fun… for the players, makes them fun for the fans, people across the country to watch,” Riley said. “You have to balance that with playing great football… you have to have poise but you also have to have the intensity too.” 
Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams has experience playing in rivalry games with title implications, losing 37-33 to Oklahoma State last season and missing the Big 12 Championship game when the quarterback was a freshman at Oklahoma. 
“Caleb’s played in a lot of, not only rivalry games, but games with title implications — and those get different this time of year,” Riley said. “I like where our guy’s been… I think it will help him play well.” 
Williams has had an excellent season thus far, throwing for over 3,000 yards and 31 touchdowns while adding 6 scores on the ground. 
“I’ve been in other big rivalry games so far in my career, so I’m treating it like another game,” Williams said. “We start trying to do things that you haven’t normally done… one of the first things that we talked about as a group and as a team is focusing on us… playing our game and going out there and trying to help the Trojans go 1-0.”
On the other side, redshirt senior Dorian Thompson-Robinson is quite familiar with the Crosstown Showdown, as this will be the quarterback’s fourth time facing the Trojans as a starter.
Thompson-Robinson, who has faced Riley’s Oklahoma Sooners twice, is a dual-threat quarterback who can advance the ball through the air or using his legs.
“He was impressive from the jump. He’s a really good player… when you watch him you see a guy that has played a lot of ball,” Riley said. “He’s obviously had a phenomenal year… I’m always a fan of guys that lead and play the game at a high level.”
For Thompson-Robinson, the rivalry runs deep. 
“Obviously we hate those guys across town,” Thompson-Robinson said before asserting that the Bruins wanted to, again, score more than 60 points against the Trojans on Saturday.
USC’s defense hasn’t allowed over 60 points this season, but it has allowed an average of 31.8 points per game, struggling to prevent big plays. Dual-threat quarterbacks, like junior Cameron Rising of Utah and sophomore Jayden de Laura of Arizona, have given the Trojan defense trouble. 
UCLA’s senior running back Zach Charbonnet, who has managed over 1,100 yards and 13 touchdowns on the ground this season, will only add to the defense’s list of concerns.
“A lot of it is just disciplined football. There is not a good defense that does not involve that word,” Defensive Coordinator Alex Grinch said on defending against Charbonnet. “You’re talking about probably the best tailback certainly that I think we’ve faced this year, the ability to run through tackles, to run hard.”
After going down with an injury against Utah, sophomore linebacker Eric Gentry’s absence has certainly been felt by the Trojan defense. Gentry has a chance to play in Saturday’s game, along with injured sophomore receiver Mario Williams.
“They’re doing well. They’re practicing, progressing. It’s an exact science… we’re hopeful we’ll be able to rep some of them both in the game,” Riley said.
The Trojans will take on the Bruins in the Rose Bowl Saturday at 5 p.m.

One thing is certain, I am going to wake up Sunday with the excitement of a little kid on Christmas morning. The World Cup is finally here and Qatar will welcome thousands of fans with the inaugural ceremony and opening match between the host country and Ecuador.
We have been waiting 156 days since the supposed start of the most anticipated tournament; due to weather conditions the game was pushed back to Nov. 20. The 2022 Qatar World Cup has been in the making since 2010 — a period of 12 years where the Middle Eastern country has been under the spotlight. 
A recent Netflix documentary showcasing interviews with former FIFA president Sepp Blatter and other executive board members depicts the corruption within the largest sports governing body. 
The first episode of the documentary highlights how greed can become the largest enemy of organized sport. We learn that the previous FIFA president, João Havelange, practically handed Blatter the seat of president. Blatter had been within the organization leading the efforts of commercialization of the game. Through his salesman personality, Blatter was able to land huge sums of money through major deals with brands such as Adidas and Coca-Cola. That is where corruption began. 
As a result of the immense marketing deals, Blatter was convinced of moving on to larger feats and looked to broadcast rights as an answer. Through a partnership with International Sport and Leisure, Blatter was able to market deals with major broadcasting companies and thus began making large amounts of revenue. 
This piece of insight helps us understand why Blatter and FIFA chose to do a bid for both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups as early as 2010. Typically, only one World Cup’s location was decided per term. It is understandable that when you can sell a bundle of two products rather than one, you can upcharge the sale. That is just what the intentions were here; putting two tournaments together so that broadcasting companies would negotiate a larger deal and have FIFA, as a result, earn more money. 
Of course, the documentary also shows how many of the officials within the federation would receive bribes in exchange for a vote — one which would mean Blatter as president or the World Cup in your country. Blatter became president in 1998. A year later he started a program called GOAL which was meant to fund the development of the sport in countries with less resources. This resulted in a form of loyalty from these countries towards Blatter that would help him in his campaigns. One ran on the foundation that he would bring the World Cup to an African country; a few years later South Africa won the bid. 
Overall, the documentary shows how FIFA is a garden of Eden that grants only a select group of individuals an invitation to enjoy the riches. These riches, however, have corrupted the minds of these executives and in turn have made the game more dirty. However, fans don’t seem to mind this whole issue, as we want to see a great spectacle. And if the final is rigged to have Messi and Ronaldo face-off in the last match, we’d enjoy it equally.

I started this semester off absolutely elated to have a column dedicated to comedy. Finally, I could write about what I’m passionate about. Then, I got caught up with profiles and events and a couple of (painful) emergency listicles. Add my editor duties on top of that, and my beautiful little column fell through the cracks. However, I knew it was time for a resurrection to pay my respects to a very special man, the king of comedy, Elon Musk.
I probably wouldn’t even be allowed to write my column, since it was only a few weeks ago that Musk declared comedy to be legal again thanks to his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter. Musk’s Twitter profile can now be littered with all the dated iFunny memes a girl could dream of. 
Even better, Musk was able to liberate all Twitter comedians that rely on homophobia, racism and transphobia to win the small rush of adrenaline that comes with a couple hundred retweets from randos with no profile picture (as if those users weren’t already doing so). All of Musk’s fan club is free to post heinous, offensive, painfully unfunny Tweets such as superimposing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s face onto a nude body with saggy breasts. 
As always with Twitter, some actually funny people were able to turn Musk’s inane rules against him to create a great, very short-lived meme. By handing Musk eight dollars for a verification symbol, users could finally make parody accounts without utilizing the white circle emoji. From Nintendo to Chiquita, no one was safe. Maybe I clowned on Musk too quickly; comedy was back!
Musk was especially targeted during the online attacks. My personal favorite came from Chris Kluwe, who changed his Twitter page to match Musk’s own page.
“There is nothing better than waking up and enjoying a fresh, steaming cup of my own urine,” Kluwe tweeted earlier this month. “Such a tangy way to start the day, and it’s scientifically proven to help brain cells grow. If you want to be like me, drink your pee.” 
An absolutely classic gag, 10/10, no notes. 
However, nothing good can last forever (or even for a few weeks). I guess the goofball couldn’t take any goofs. Kluwe was promptly banned with many others following suit. 
To be honest, while I had the time of my life looking through the parody Tweets, I didn’t originally see them on Twitter. I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I actually saw them on TikTok. My For You page has been plagued with nonstop videos of men standing in front of Tweets they did not write. Honestly, I’m not sure what I did to someone at the TikTok headquarters to deserve such a vile curse. Seeing those videos honestly gives me the same level of rage that I imagine gamers get. Even further, they have the audacity to promote their Instagram handles in front of the stolen Tweets. 
But, like, at least take the effort to retype the tweet to make it seem like your own. If you’re going to profit off of someone else’s work, could you please put a little effort in? It’s not even that hard to copy and paste. One more screenshotted tweet and I may implode. 
Twitter creates the comedy of the internet. Any meme is just a regurgitated viral tweet. Only one person needs to say something original, typically on Twitter, before leeches from other platforms come to gain clout from it. It’s just like those TikTok commenters that say, “someone really said [insert the joke another commenter made].” I’m not sure who needs to hear this, but just so you know, we are all looking at the exact same comment section. 
My column used to be called “Who Cares?,” and honestly, I should’ve kept that title because really, who cares?
But I just can’t help it. My time on the internet, meant to bring me laughs, just makes me angry. Maybe my chronic annoyance is why I found a gray hair the other day. 
For me, comedy is an art. A person’s work should be sacred. So why is the average TikTok user able to get away with such theft? 
For non-internet comedians, people actually call out joke theft. James Corden just had to publicly tweet an apology for performing a joke similar to one from Ricky Gervais’ 2018 Netflix special. It’s likely Corden didn’t even write that bit. Still, he owned up to it and promoted Gervais’ work (which is an issue for another time).
“Saturday Night Live” also found itself in some hot water when viewers caught extreme similarities between their “Charmin Bears” sketch with Miles Teller and YouTuber Joel Haver’s “Toilet Paper Bears” video. Unlike Corden, “SNL” has not responded. Although, it seems Haver holds no grudge.
There’s also the greatest exposé of all time: “Amy Schumer’s ‘Parallel Thinking’ Compilation” which was posted on YouTube over six years ago. In the video, clips of Schumer are played alongside clips from other comedians such as Patrice O’Neal and John Mulaney revealing eerie similarities, that as much as Schumer may claim were due to  “parallel thinking,” are a huge hit to any credibility she has as a comic. 
Still, she has a prospering career which I don’t see slowing down any time soon. So, maybe while people call it out, it doesn’t even matter. Joke theft is happening everywhere. I may just be destined to sit and stew for the rest of my time on this planet.
While I spent my column word allotment complaining, I want to remind you that there are incredible, wonderfully original and creative comics out there deserving of your attention. You just need to fight through the plagiarism noise a little harder. 
I also want to say that the retweet button is right there. Use it.

What happens when the metric that is used to measure expectations for a certain experience could not be more off base? Enter depictions of college life in film — the plots of well-received classics like “National Lampoon’s Animal House,” “The House Bunny” and “American Pie” hinge on themes of partying and gratification for their popularity.
Everyone loves a raunchy and raucous college movie, but disappointment is in store for those who remain blissfully unaware of what college life mostly consists of. The stress on mental and physical health is often overlooked in the entertainment industry as college movies are dominated by parties, romance and nothing in between.
Coming to grips with this massive hole in accurate representation and ignoring it would have been easy enough, but for Anthony Alyassi, a senior majoring in English, this served as inspiration for his new short film, “The Undergraduate.” The film depicts what is the truth of college life for many students  — stress. The film follows Henry Hewitt (Chandler Riggs), an overworked college student, as he races to complete his physics exam in two hours after various external factors prevented him from doing so.
From the start, Alyassi’s project was extremely personal. He too had been led astray by the media and expected his college years to be the “best of the best,” but he was instead met with never-ending stressors that rapidly destroyed his mental health. At one point, he was juggling a 20-unit semester and three jobs at once, in addition to extracurriculars. His situation was so grim that he seriously considered dropping out of university altogether.
Partly due to realizing that no other film had been able to do the modern college experience justice, in tandem with his own taxing college experience as a struggling junior at the time, Alyassi was looking to produce a brutally realistic and unfortunately, relatable, college film. 
“I think that a lot of films and television that I see personally don’t have a representation of students on this side. This film is really talking about how stressful it is sometimes for students who work on projects and their exams, and also balancing our social life and work life,” assistant director Beatrice Jiang said. “I think this is important because we see this side of students and that we don’t feel like we are alone. It really helped to raise awareness for students’ mental health and also helped to give younger students a different expectation when they come into college.” 
Even though the task of creating a film without any comparable references was extremely daunting to Alyassi, there was never substantial doubt about whether or not to try.
 “To me, it just always seemed like ‘I have to make this film,’” Alyassi said.
The entire movie was filmed in three 12-hour days, and it aimed to bring attention to the difficulties faced by a student while balancing their academic, professional and social life.
“We really wanted to start a larger conversation about student mental health in the film industry,” said Megan Sullivan, the film’s production designer and post-production supervisor.
Working with Screen Actors Guild actors that required regulations, contractual negotiations, coordinating with their agents and publicists, and time crunches, added another layer of professionalism to the film’s production. Sullivan said that the project is a very near replica of making a professional film and was “an incredible learning experience for [her] as a young filmmaker.”
Determination on Alyassi’s part proved to be essential, as the road to the completion of the young director’s production was anything but easy; the project was intended to be filmed at USC, but after submitting their script to the USC Campus Filming Office, it was ultimately rejected, citing that they could not approve anything they deemed “​​any way derogatory toward higher education, including anything that portrays students or faculty in a negative manner.”
Filming at USC was not financially attainable either, as Alyassi said that the cost to film in Doheny Memorial Library was more than their entire budget. Although USC rejected the script due to its portrayal of student life in a negative way, Alyassi successfully pitched the controversial narrative to UCLA’s event offices, who supported the difficult subjects the film was attempting to touch upon. 
“The price was just absurd … UCLA was not like [USC]. UCLA, without even reading the script, actually gave us permission to film at Powell Library — which is where all of the library scenes are filmed … they gave us a huge discount because we were students,” Alyassi said. 
This led to Alyassi partnering with other students from different schools, including UCLA, NYU, Chapman University and the American Film Institute, to produce the film. Getting approval to film at UCLA’s prestigious library also made “The Undergraduate” the first public non-UCLA film to shoot at their library since 1983. 
“[Filming in Powell] was fun because it was such a big set we had to work with. I have more experience working in small spaces inside or outdoors where we just have natural sunlight, but we had a giant hall and we had to bring in all of our own lighting equipment and light the set,” said Joshua Gravitt, the film’s director of photography. “They were very restrictive on what we could do and how long we could be there for… We had to work within the time constraints. We ended up spending a lot of time setting up, which was tough, but that was definitely the most rewarding day getting to shoot in Powell and some of the most important scenes in the film take place there.”
Alyassi was not alone in his mission to produce this film, and partnered with film production company Morning Moon Productions, an independent company founded in 2017 “focused on identifying and developing compelling stories and talent,” according to their website. Morning Moon Productions was his former employer and one of the groups’ greatest supporters,  helping significantly in the pre-production phase.
Alyassi also credits Morning Moons Productions’ Ethan Lazar, his boss, with connecting him with Riggs’ agent. 
“He wanted me for the role. I was in another TV show a few years ago called ‘A Million Little Things’ and my character on that show, he went through a lot depression and he attempted suicide in the show,” Riggs said. “So Anthony, having seen that, wanted me for this role because it was pretty fitting to the levels of anxiety and stress that Henry will experience.” 
Riggs said that with this role, he really tried to “hone in on that level of stress and anxiety” that his character was facing. 
“Being on set, none of it was ever super difficult, to be honest. The hardest part for me was when I was preparing for it, I would go through the entire script and have to experience every single heightened level of intensity,” Riggs said. 
Outside of the challenges of finding a filming location and an actor to bring his story to life, Alyassi also said filming in the summer limited the number of students available to help on set, and how he solved this issue with almost no time to spare after industry professionals agreed to help out simply because they believed in the project.
“It boiled down to us literally going on LinkedIn… and just asking people,” Alyassi said. “What we found is when you have a project that is about something that’s socially important… people are willing to help.” 
Despite voicing some regrets about how a particular shot was filmed and things of that nature, Alyassi believes that he accomplished many things with this project. He said that the most difficult aspect for him personally was learning to embrace the vulnerability that came with this project; it was no secret that the story and main character were largely based on himself, and Alyassi expressed initial discomfort with people seeing a more intimate and raw side of him.
“I think I just felt a lot of shame for the things I went through, and I felt like there was something wrong with me, not with the University but myself, and when making the film I kinda realized that’s not the case,” Alyassi said. “There’s nothing to be ashamed about if you’re going through problems and you’re struggling.” 
Sullivan said that one of Alyassi’s strengths as a writer and director is “his ability to go in depth in the character with a great understanding of the world.” 
“Henry’s character is the epitome of perseverance, which is something that I resonated with,”  Sullivan said. 
When asked about unwelcome interpretations of the project, the young filmmaker made his thoughts very clear; the audience should refrain from victim blaming or criticizing the lead for his actions — rather, they should be questioning the normalization and encouragement of the unhealthy student expectations that are reflected in Henry’s character. 
With “The Undergraduate” team finally planning test screenings for students both at USC and UCLA, Alyassi believes that his original intention has been realized — and with yet another short film of his coming to life, Alyassi encourages aspiring actors and filmmakers to attach themselves to “stories that challenge you.”
“When you’re taking on these projects that really challenge you, throw you out of your comfort zone, it makes you really reflect, ‘I am the person to tell this story?’ and those are the ones you really learn from and you really grow from,” Alyassi said.
A test screening for “The Undergraduate” will be held Monday in the School of Cinematic Arts Building in SCI 106.
