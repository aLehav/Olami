Gone so soon · DeRozan, who left after one season at USC, is likely to be a top 10 pick in the NBA draft. | Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
DeRozan canceled a workout Monday with the Minnesota Timberwolves, who hold the No. 6 pick, due to illness. The 6-foot-7 forward reportedly felt sick after a Sunday workout with the Memphis Grizzlies and flew home to Los Angeles instead of working out with the team.
DeRozan has also worked out with a number of other teams in the top 10, including the Oklahoma City Thunder, the New York Knicks and the Washington Wizards. He has been most frequently linked to the Toronto Raptors, who hold the No. 9 pick and are believed to be looking for a wing player in the draft.
The former USC star was also invited to the green room of Thursday’s draft and is expected to attend the event in New York City. 
Gibson could be one of the late risers in the draft and is being mentioned as a possible late first round pick. Some mock drafts have him going as early as No. 20 to the Utah Jazz, while others project him to be selected somewhere in the beginning of the second round.
Within the last week, Gibson has worked out for Utah, Oklahoma City and the New Orleans Hornets.
Hackett is believed to be a second round pick at best. DraftExpress.com reported that Hackett already has in place a multi-year contract with the Italian team Benetton Treviso. The website reported that the contract included a clause that would allow him to join an NBA team if one drafted him or signed him to a contract as an undrafted free agent. 
Hackett worked out last week for the Knicks and the Detroit Pistons.

Big job, bigger questions · No one, including O’Neill, is denying the fact that the USC job is going to a huge challenge given recent allegations and the prospect of santions looming. |  Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
It started off with a bang.
USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett introduced new men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill at a Varsity Lounge press conference Monday, saying, “Kevin, the floor is yours.”
O’Neill’s first public comments as the coach of a program under intense scrutiny from the NCAA?
He pointed over to his wife, 32-year-old Roberta. “There won’t be any questions about recruiting, I trust,” O’Neill said. “I can recruit, obviously.”
All joking aside, O’Neill, 52, made a favorable impression in his first step on a long road back for both him and the USC basketball program.
Former coach Tim Floyd had made inroads in raising the national profile of what had long been a largely irrelevant program, but, facing a looming NCAA investigation this offseason, he decided to resign. 
The one-paragraph resignation e-mail sent to Garrett came June 9, less than a month after Floyd was accused of delivering an envelope of cash to the handler of former USC basketball player O.J. Mayo.
Since then, the inquiries grew louder and louder, leading Garrett and Senior Vice President of Administration Todd Dickey to deliver unprecedented video statements posted on USC’s official website.
Many wondered where USC would find its next coach, considering both the likelihood of NCAA sanctions that could limit postseason play and/or scholarships and the sheer lack of talent left on the roster, as only nine scholarship players remain after a mass exodus of both current players and incoming recruits.
Well, Garrett and USC found him, toiling as an assistant coach and special assistant to the general manager for the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies, just one year removed from spending the 2007-2008 season as the interim head coach at Pac-10 rival Arizona.
“We’ve been through a lot, and, in looking at different potential candidates all over the country … I came to the conclusion that I really felt elated about the fact that this is the kind of person who was available,” Garrett said.
Reports say that Garrett first offered the job to Pittsburgh head man Jamie Dixon, the former protégé of UCLA coach Ben Howland. After Dixon said no, both NBA Finals analyst (and former NBA head coach) Jeff Van Gundy and current UNLV coach Lon Kruger reportedly rebuffed offers from USC as well.
Nevertheless, Garrett — who has caught much flak for his coaching hires over the years, including the notion that Pete Carroll was his fourth choice to become the football head coach in 2000 — insisted that O’Neill was indeed his first choice for the job.
“Everyone I talked to was not shying away from USC,” Garrett said. “It was not a selling job, it was more of a find the right fit.
“I think Kevin was my first choice because when I started talking to him, he’s the one that I wanted to have. He’s the guy that fit what I needed. It was a natural fit,” Garrett said.
But O’Neill himself doesn’t come without controversy.
He’s known as a Bob Knight-lite, a fierce competitor who sometimes lets his emotions get the best of him. 
Many of his former players have expressed distaste with his methods. He’s never been a player’s coach; rather, he’s been labeled as more of a defensive-minded, let-the-offense-flow kind of guy.
The still-fiery O’Neill attacked those conceptions Monday.
“I’m a different coach than I was the first time I was in college. I really don’t apologize for how I coach at all. I coach hard, I’m aggressive … but it’s like anything else. Over 20 years, you do change a little bit.
“I’m not for every player, and that’s all there is to it. Every coach isn’t for every player,” O’Neill said. “But, I’ve been in a multitude of players’ weddings, and pro and college guys don’t invite you to be in their weddings unless they like you a little bit.”
O’Neill further defended his coaching style. 
“I’m a great defensive coach. But what people think is that if you’re a defensive coach, you don’t coach offense, or if you’re an offensive coach you don’t value defense. I value the whole game.”
USC returns only one player who averaged more than 18 minutes per game last season: senior guard Dwight Lewis. Junior guard/forward Marcus Simmons and sophomore forwards Nikola Vucevic and Leonard Washington will be the only other returners who contributed last season.
Despite that, O’Neill said he expects to compete immediately. 
“I think we’ve got a good core group of guys,” O’Neill said. “It would be my expectation that, when we hit the practice court, that we’re thinking about nothing short of being in the NCAA Tournament.
“This is a competitive group, and I think these guys will play good basketball every single day, I think they’ll work hard, and I think they’ll surprise some people.”
As for the ongoing NCAA investigation, it didn’t seem to bother O’Neill much.
“I really didn’t care what had happened, and we didn’t get into detail because that’s not my place,” O’Neill said. “I was taking the job no matter what. I wanted the job from the beginning because it’s USC. The fact that there’s an investigation going on never changed my view of the university at all.”
Reports have said the earliest any NCAA sanction could come would be October. Until then, the program is left to hope they won’t be too short-handed this season.
“We’re in limbo, we don’t know,” Garrett said. “They’re in the process, so are we, and we’re working to get to the point where we can finally come to a resolution.”
Garrett stressed, though, that O’Neill — with 12 years of experience as a head coach at the college or pro levels, including stints with Marquette and the Toronto Raptors — was the right man to lead the program out of the shadow of investigation and into a new image.
“He’d be a great coach for us any season, let alone what we’re going through now,” Garrett said. “I know he’ll guide us the way we should be guided.”

 Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information Throw down · The Lexus Gauntlet spices up the USC-UCLA rivalry and is not just a marketing strategy, staff writer Brian Wagner writes. |  Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
The USC-UCLA rivalry is getting even more intense.
Another competitive season of college athletics has come and gone and the Lexus Gauntlet has been awarded to the USC for the second consecutive year.
The Lexus Gauntlet is an annual ongoing competition between USC and UCLA that tracks all head-to-head wins the schools rack up against one another.  Since its establishment in 2001, there had been no repeat winner before this year. USC ensured its hoisting of the cup through the men’s and women’s track and field squads. The annual dual meet against the Bruins took place on May 2, and USC’s performance allowed it to retain the Gauntlet for a second year. 
In the eight years of the Gauntlet’s existence, USC has now won five to UCLA’s three. 
For fans, the Lexus Gauntlet, no doubt, brings more excitement. It allows fans to be more  attentive to all collegiate sports and truly exemplifies the utter importance and variance of the rivalry. Senior USC student Adam Kossoff explained the greatness from a fan’s perspective: “I really enjoy following the Lexus Gauntlet. [It’s] more than just football and basketball. The Gauntlet brings out all parts of the rivalry.”
Football may still be the sport that earns the most bragging rights for each school because of its overwhelming popularity, but it is golf, tennis and rowing, for example, that have an extensive impact on the Gauntlet, along with every Division-I sport. 
It really brings the whole rivalry into perspective. 
“We always want to beat UCLA, but when [the Gauntlet] is involved, it’s very motivating,” said Tom Glissmeyer of the USC men’s golf team. Glissmeyer affirms that he and his teammates, along with the rest of the student athletes, hold a large interest in the Lexus Gauntlet. 
As Tom Walsh, the USC women’s cross country head coach, said, “The Gauntlet puts the USC-UCLA rivalry more into focus.  This rivalry has always been great, but now it adds more attention to the minor sports.” 
Walsh stresses the true meaning of college athletics. It doesn’t revolve around one sport or two, he said, but rather the sum of the program, analogous to the 19 respected sports in USC’s athletic department. 
But when it is all said and done, the Gauntlet means most to the athletes themselves. And two questions are left unanswered when the Cup is awarded to the winning program: Do the athletes appreciate the competition of the Lexus Gauntlet? Or is it merely a marketing strategy? 
After speaking with many collegiate athletes and coaches, ranging from all sports, there cannot be more of a clear-cut answer. 
There is a certain entity in the cross-town rivalry that isn’t found everywhere you turn. These athletes from USC and UCLA compete to be the best, and within this rivalry, pride is at the core of it all. 
“It becomes much more than a game. It no longer becomes a match of wins and losses, but also of pride,” said Alison Ramos of the USC women’s tennis team. “When we defeat UCLA and take the cup, we keep our pride over a prestigious rival.” 
The athletes certainly recognize the prestige of the Lexus Gauntlet and the rivalry as a whole. Along with the goals of Pac-10 titles and national championships beginning with each new season, beating UCLA remains to be of utmost importance to USC athletics. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to know it is one of the most touted accomplishments for the program, and the athletes convey that message very clearly through their fierce competition. 
“There is most definitely a large sense of pride involved when beating UCLA,” states USC’s men’s track and field star Aven Wright. “On top of competing against UCLA, there is that extra pressure because of our school pride.” 
The Lexus Gauntlet is a tangible element that demonstrates the intense rivalry that is USC-UCLA. The school pride for both programs has been there since its origin, but the Gauntlet has indubitably spiced things up. And has done so for the better.
There is no doubt the USC-UCLA rivalry is one of the greatest in all of sports. And there is no doubt the initiation of the Lexus Gauntlet has added a little extra motivation for the athletes, and added excitement and awareness for the fans. 
USC’s athletes identify that the Lexus Gauntlet simply reinforces the rivalry as one of the best. As far as being victorious, it is certainly an honor to be awarded the Lexus Gauntlet Cup, and the athletes are very aware of it what it entails — to themselves, their teams, their program and their fans. 
Although it’s at a relatively young age, it is easy to see the Lexus Gauntlet is energizing a rivalry that is already one of the best. 
And the athletes are happy to be a part of it.

Straight shooter· Brian Geraghty stars as Specialist Owen Eldridge in the war film “The Hurt Locker.” The film also stars Jeremy Renner and Anthony Mackie, and features Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce. 
Nobody wants to see an Iraq war movie.
This is the current sentiment among Hollywood studio executives, who shed all hopes of garnering profit off the War in Iraq after 2007 carried a slew of desert-set, gun-toting films of epic proportions and even more epic box office failures.
The names were of A-list status — Meryl Streep and Tom Cruise in “Lions for Lambs,” Reese Witherspoon and Jake Gyllenhaal in “Rendition,” Jamie Foxx and Jason Bateman in “The Kingdom.”
The direction also boasted equally as impressive names, including Academy Award winners Robert Redford and Gavin Hood. 
And even the plots were a step up from the typical explosives-loaded action flick, featuring pseudo-intellectual story lines with government officials teetering on the thin line between right and wrong from their air-conditioned offices in Washington, D.C.
Yet for all the genre revamping and celebrity pimping, these films still — perhaps appropriately — bombed.
Then there was this little film — helmed by a genre-bending female director and featuring virtual unknowns in the leading roles — quickly gaining momentum in the film festival circuit and threatening to dethrone “Saving Private Ryan” as the greatest contemporary war film. 
When Kathryn Bigelow’s “The Hurt Locker” made its world premiere at the 65th Annual Venice Film Festival last September, audiences did not know what hit them — but they embraced it with a 10-minute-long standing ovation and the festival’s grand prize. Bigelow’s lo-fi epic was then off to the Toronto International Film Festival, where it was lauded by American critics, placed in the top six films of the festival and given a distribution home with Summit Entertainment. 
Despite the praise and acclamations, which also included two Film Independent’s Spirit Award nominations, “The Hurt Locker” had to fight for its domestic release (now set for this Friday). And it’s a good thing it did.
Penned by freelance journalist Mark Boal, who spent several years working in Iraq, “The Hurt Locker” follows a three-person U.S. Army Explosive Ordinance Disposal (or more commonly known as the “bomb squad”) unit stationed in Baghdad, Iraq sometime in 2004. 
There’s James, the unit’s wildly unconventional leader played by the electrifying Jeremy Renner; Anthony Mackie’s Sanborn, the play-by-the-rules type who finds himself constantly butting heads with James; and Eldridge, the youngest and most neurotic unit member played pitch-perfectly by Brian Geraghty. 
Though Boal chose to write about soldiers, Renner’s character — a reckless thrill-seeker who would do anything for an adrenaline rush — could easily be an alcoholic, speed addict or nymphomaniac. In a way, the film is not about men behaving badly in war, but people behaving in any type of stressful, harrowing or painful situation — this one just happens to include giant EODs.

Bigelow’s perceptive direction combined with Boal’s insightful yet matter-of-fact script produces a film that is ridden with paradoxes — objective but not heartless, realistic but not documentarian, hard-hitting but not over-the-top and yes, a war film but not exactly about war.
It is this inability to describe “The Hurt Locker” with certainties and definitives that reflects the moral dilemma of war. Rather than entangling herself in political agendas or moral complexities, Bigelow lets the film — and its characters — speak for itself. 
The actors never seem to have down time; they’re constantly on edge in nearly every scene, possessing a glittering fear in their eyes that never seems to fade away. 
Renner has the hardest task with James, a reckless war hawk who uses his brashness to hide the slightest ounce of fear he has. As Bigelow captures James in his most intimate moments, which vary widely from playing soccer in a father-son fashion with a young Iraqi boy to taking a shower, fully clothed, to wash away blood that isn’t his, an unforeseen tenderness is revealed.
Bigelow lets these slight moments of affection cut through tension-laced scenes, and it’s the nuanced focus on the minute, even mundane details — the sharing of a juice box during a stake-out or the persistent flies buzzing along the edges of the soldier’s eyelashes — that makes “The Hurt Locker,” dare I say, real. 
Super-imposed in fuzzy block lettering at the film’s start is a simple quote: “War is a drug.” Like every addiction, it’s an explicable craving that leaves its victim willingly running in circles, chasing an elusive feeling they can never quite catch. 
Bigelow makes no blatant attempt to say if it’s right or wrong, and she doesn’t have to — for those on the frontline, it is what it is.

Don’t tell mama · The MET Theatre in Los Angeles is bringing the beloved musical “Cabaret” to its stage, albeit without Liza Minelli (above) the 1972 film’s star. In this brand new production, Kalinda Gray tackles Minelli’s famous role of Sally Bowles, the young leading lady of a Berlin nightclub in 1931, during the rise of the Nazi party in Germany. This production of “Cabaret” is running now until August 9.  | Photo Courtesy of IMDB.com
“Hello, ladies! I’m Bobby,” says an eyeliner-smudged dancer as he straddles my roommate and runs a finger from my knee into my boot.
Welcome to Berlin.
“Are you two dirty girls?” he asks with a scrunch-nosed smile. “Mm I can tell zat you are.”
Welcome to Berlin.
“Do you vant anysing to drink?” He blows a raspberry and makes thumbs down to our declination. “Party poopers. I’ll be back later.” He sashays away, his black vest flapping over bare abs.
When you first slip through the front door, up the dark stairs and across the postage-stamp lobby of the MET Theatre, you expect something smarter than a strip club, sassier than High School Musical and more interactive than an IMAX movie.
Welcome to “Cabaret,” where there are no troubles — or so they say.
It helps to be 21. 
As you watch the Kit Kat boys in tux pants, bow ties and vests, and girls in bloomers and the kind of brassiere your grandmother wears perch their toe on a pink husband’s knee or wrap their thigh around the waist of a darting-eyed girlfriend they pulled onstage, you’re going to want a gin and tonic. 
Luckily, the actors double as servers, there to tuck your drink order and your cash into a garter belt in exchange for liquoring you up.
By the time the first oompah notes of the orchestra — led by musical director and conductor Greg Hakke — add to the din, there’s already a buzz in the 99-seat playhouse.
The emcee (Eduardo Enrikez) teeters out from under the mirrored central arch of the fiery, minimalist set by Victoria Bellocq, inspired by painter Paul Klee. He sports a web of suspenders with a juicy bowtie caught over his chest hair, dollish makeup, clown-like military boots and a suit jacket. He croons Wilkommen, Bienvenue, Welcome! to the semi-fondled crowd, and we believe him. His German accent is cut with a dose of affectation, but his words permeate the cozy (if partially vacant) audience without the aid of a wireless mike. 
Our host formally introduces us to Lulu, Texas, Frenchie, Rosie, Fritzie, Helga, Swing, Bobby, Victor, Hans and Herman; but at this point, we’re already pretty intimate.
Nonetheless, you’re going to want a rum and coke when the emcee announces that “Each and every one” of the Kit Kat girls is a virgin, then asks, “Don’t believe me? Try Helga,” slips his hand between her legs, licks his fingers and, evidently, “tries” her.
This shocking (but uproariously appreciated) humor is the star of director Judy Norton’s show, upstaging the heart-rending plotline and robbing tender moments of their authenticity.
Set in 1931 Germany and obliquely detailing the rise of the Nazi party through the experiences of American novelist Clifford Bradshaw (played very straightforwardly by Michael Bernardi), “Cabaret” has the potential to be a dynamo of human compassion. It can assail audience members’ defenses with the hard truths about war and power, and prod the dark humor out of one of the bleakest chapters in modern human history: the Holocaust.
On a more temporal level, Kalinda Gray’s rendition of Sally Bowles, the 19-year-old English leading lady of the Berlin nightclub around which the play revolves, delivers a crushing performance with the namesake ballad “Cabaret.” The ebullience of Act I is utterly sapped from her body as she fights pointless tears in her final number. 
Even though at the outset her character is “living in delicious sin,” as Sally puts it, a transformation from naïveté to world-weariness is solidified for the first time as she huskily belts, Start by admitting from cradle to tomb/ Isn’t that long a stay./ Life is a Cabaret, old chum [and] I love a Cabaret!
But you’re going to want a whiskey on the rocks when the emcee’s accent dissipates throughout the show until its bold reemergence in the final scenes. 
You’re going to want one when opening-night jitters make the Fosse-esque choreography (by Tania Possick, who also plays Lulu) a little sloppy and too much like a real cabaret. 
You’re going to want one when ready-made jokes fall flat — like Fraulein Schnider’s (Annalisa Erickson’s) insistence to Herr Schultz (huge-voiced Jayson Kraid), “You must not bring me any more pineapples, you hear? It is not proper. It is a gift that a young man would bring to his lady love; makes me blush!”
Or when the fairly inebriated audience giggles and cheers when the emcee asks at the close of the show, “Where are your troubles now — forgotten?” after a starkly more dramatic and deliberately troubling Act II.
Voices like those of Fraulein Kost (Josie Yount) and little Anna Ludwig (the tenacious and young Danielle Soibelman) chisel away at the sticker shock of a ticket, and the orgastic energy that the cast brings to the stage is unparalleled. 
One can only hope that by the time “Cabaret” closes, it won’t need its alcoholic crutch to stun spectators.

Love and war · Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star is Marc Webb’s delightfully post-modern “(500) Days of Summer.” The film is a contemporary story about love and relationships, set entirely in Los Angeles. After screening at several film festivals, including Sundance and South by Southwest, “(500) Days of Summer” has become one of the most anticipated independent films this year. The film will be screened at the Los Angeles Film Festival this Friday, and will open Los Angeles and New York July 17. | Photo Courtesy of Fox Searchlight 
“(500) Days of Summer” has all the correct ingredients for a quirky relationship film: two super-adorable actors with immeasurable amounts of spunky charisma, a hip soundtrack featuring both new and old artists with indie street cred and a refreshing tag line (“This is not a love story. This is a story about love.”) for those new-agers freshly jaded from a recent break-up. 
So what went wrong?
It’s a bigger mystery than main protagonist Tom’s existential quest to figure out what exactly happened between Summer, the so-called love of his life, and him. 
Unfortunately, this question lingers longer than the film’s emotional sugar rush.
“(500) Days of Summer” is truly a New Wave film for the MTV generation. Starring child star-turned-serious leading man Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tom and every fedora-clad hipster’s dream girl Zooey Deschanel as Summer, “(500) Days of Summer” markets itself as a contemporary love story — excuse me, a story about love — for all of the 20-somethings out there currently struggling with their less than perfect love lives. 
Add in the easy on the ears yet painfully self-aware compilation of The Smiths, Regina Spektor, Spoon and Black Lips, and any semi-frequent Amoeba-goer will feel like this movie was made for him or her. 
True to its demographic, the film follows a pair of 20-somethings living alone in Los Angeles. One half of this pair (Tom) is searching for love, while the other half (Summer) is perfectly happy with whatever she gets. They flirt, they date, they kiss and they fight — all out of order in true post-modern fashion. 
“(500) Days of  Summer”  is sure to propel Gordon-Levitt to a newfound heartthrob status that he hasn’t seen since his “10 Things I Hate About You” days. 
Now all grown-up, though still clinging onto his clean-shaven baby face, Gordon-Levitt is funny, sensitive and heart-felt as that self-conscious guy unsure of how cool he really is. 
Deschanel, sadly, has less to play in her role as the — what else? — love interest. For the first half of the film, Summer is the kick-ass 21st century woman, trading emotional attachment for her vinyl collection.
As for the film’s second half, with Tom’s love for her slowly fading away, Summer becomes less of a real character and more of an image of everything Tom hoped she would be — and wasn’t. Nonetheless, Deschanel plays her character well for what she’s given. 
This image of Summer is further reinforced through the French New Wave-style editing that seems to place her on a grand pedestal. Case in point: In a roughly edited, jump cut-ridden scene, the immensely beautiful Summer lies on top of electric white sheets, smiling coyly into the camera while bright sunbeams perfectly frame her heart-shaped face. 

Yeah, OK.
Most refreshing about “(500) Days of Summer” is not a drunken Gordon-Levitt performing karaoke to the Pixies’ “Here Comes My Man” (though it is quite endearing) or the musical montages, (which end up overpowering the plot instead of driving it), but the way director Marc Webb visually depicts Los Angeles.
Shot entirely on the streets and in the storefronts and high-rises of Downtown in a blend of steely grays and warm sepia tones, showing off angular yet graceful cityscapes and lush, green parks that are a far cry from the concrete playgrounds so often photographed by filmmakers — it’s a Los Angeles unlike you’ve ever seen. 
Akin with the glorified setting, the entire film is set in a hyper-reality full of neatly placed melodrama. This idealized love leaves you with that quintessential warm and fuzzy feeling, but that buzz gradually dissipates after several hours, turning into what may or may not be heartburn. 
As the achronological storytelling gimmick eventually becomes exhausted, the film’s once off-beat energy fails to keep up until the very end, leaving viewers unsatisfied with its inauthentic, too-good-to-be-true ending. 
Did it really have to go there? you’ll soon find yourself wondering. No, it didn’t, but it somehow finds itself stuck in that sugar-coated trap. 
Though “(500) Days of  Summer” boasts that it’s not a typical romantic comedy by Hollywood standards, we all know the more you try to be something you’re not, the more likely you are to fail.
While it may not play exactly by Hollywood’s rules with its slightly under-the-radar cast and crew, “(500) Days of Summer” fails to tap into the emotional highs and lows noteworthy “love stories but not” like “Annie Hall” and “When Harry Met Sally” are made of. Instead, what graces the screen is a shallow imitation of a greater expectation. 
It’s cute, poppy and upbeat. Just don’t expect Morissey to sing you to sleep when you’re lying in bed nursing a broken heart.

It’s an all-too-familiar tableau. 
A group of pasty, fleshy men and women lumber up the side of a mountain, as “Lord of the Rings”-esque arpeggios trill in the background. Suddenly, the group is inexplicably standing on the cusp of what appears to be the Grand Canyon; the score swells ominously, metaphors for the great struggle ahead fly fast and hard, and sweat pours off the furrowed brows of the 17 contestants whose sole ambition it is to be a Big Loser. 
This was the teaser for the sixth season of “The Biggest Loser,” NBC’s prime-time cash cow aimed at capturing the hearts of middle America with the struggles of obese men and women attempting to, as the official show site ebulliently states, “transform their bodies, health — and ultimately — their lives.” 
With the subtlety of boot camp officers, the show’s trainers force the contestants to hang from cranes and hurl themselves down slip ‘n slides — all in the name of good health, of course. Because, as the hosts tell us in the teaser, obesity-related deaths in the United States have climbed to a staggering 300,000 each year. 
Most television producers aren’t obtuse enough to claim that reality shows aren’t based on the solid principles of exploitation. After all, we are a culture fascinated by large families, marital unrest and people who think they can dance — in effect, people like us who are willing to pratfall on television. 
And the newest demographic level for Joe Shmoe consumption? The heifer. 
Piggybacking on the success of “The Biggest Loser,” Fox is slated to produce its newest version of the seminal millennium dating show, “The Bachelor,” only this time geared toward the 200-plus crowd. Tentatively and euphemistically termed “More To Love,” the show plans to fill the long-abandoned dating show niche for “average people.”
Mike Fleiss, producer of “The Bachelor” franchise, is collaborating with Fox’s President of Alternative Programming Mike Darnell, to create a dating show that Fleiss hopes will prove “that you can be the size you are and still be lovable,” as he told the Hollywood Reporter in an interview.
As of now, the show is focused solely on dating and not on self-improvement, though this early in the drafting process the premise is likely to be revised many times. 
The producers may allege that this is a dating show that will break the waistband of expectations for reality television, but that’s a rather bold presumption. Do viewers tune into VH1’s “Charm School” to watch savage, leopard print-clad girls turn into staid young women? Do we like Susan Boyle because she’s talented or because she looks like a cross between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ms. Frizzle?
Ultimately, reality television is about viewership, and nothing is more attractive to Nielson families than good old-fashioned spectacle. And so we await the almost certainly romanticized “More to Love” advertisements in the future. They will most likely parade a montage of teary, overweight women (perhaps standing at the edge of the Grand Canyon or some other depthless chasm meant to mirror their sparse dating life.) There will almost definitely be a woman giving an inspiration testimonial of how the show has changed her perspective on her body, her health — and ultimately — her life. And of course, there will be a Josh Groban song in the background. 
But viewers won’t be watching for emotional or physical betterment. They will watch because everyone likes a three-ring circus, and Fox is more than happy to provide.
But be careful, America. Those who live in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. Or eat cheeseburgers.

Despite initial skepticism and almost excessive simplicity, Twitter has blown up. This popular tool, designed for social networking through instant status updates, has been effectively utilized by users such as Snoop Dogg, the New York Times and even the United States Air Force.
Created in 2006, Twitter exploded in popularity during the bombings in Mumbai, and continued to increase in usage during other significant events such as the presidential election and the emergence of the swine flu. 
Twitter is shaping up to be more an effective distributor of information than a simple internet fad for several reasons, the first of which being its ease of use. Users can post tidbits of information — no longer than 140 characters in length — via phone or the Internet. So-called “followers” may then read these updates, as well as comment on the updates or even “retweet,” which essentially involves reposting the original tweet to the follower’s own page. 
The lack of annoying applications, unorganized information and the need to create a tediously designed profile has pushed Twitter to the forefront of the information-hungry Internet user’s preference.
The second reason behind Twitter’s prominence is the seemingly genuine and intimate connection it creates between users. Pete Carroll’s twitter, for instance, has more than 27,000 followers, most of whom are interested to see what the coach has to say about topics ranging from music to the NFL draft. The tech-savvy coach makes sure to tweet every few hours, posting sweet nothings such as “Song of the day is a mothers day tribute for all the love our moms ‘always’ bring to us… always by stevie wonder,” and “in case you were worried, the car’s all fixed now… just a nail in the tire… now which one of you did that???” This level of tweeting creates a relationship between celebrities and their fans completely lacking in fan pages and scattered message boards. Concise and often-humorous celebrity tweets are a refreshing change from the prepared answers usually given to interviewers.
Additionally, organizations and influential people have discovered that they can use Twitter to relay their messages to the public. When the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported that the Air Force’s Global Positioning System satellite system was doomed to fail due to a shortage of satellites, Air Force officials utilized Twitter to assuage fears. With calming tweets such as “Agree w/ GAO thr’s a potential risk, but GPS isn’t falling out of the sky–we have plans 2 mitigate risk & prevent a gap,”  Air Force officials found a way to communicate directly with the people.
Although the prevalence of this tool may reduce the need for journalists, it is perhaps a worthy trade-off. Journalists need not worry; even major news 
corporations are harnessing the power of Twitter to better communicate with their readerships. 
There is a downside, however, to such a direct tunnel of communication: There is no regulation of what is conveyed. For example, the public would be better off reading about a controversial event through the investigative reports of journalists rather than through one-sided civilian rants. In many instances, a third-party news outlet is beneficial. As long as this disadvantage is realized, Twitter will remain a useful information tool that allows for a direct relationship between the public and those in the public eye.
Despite the limitless barrage of useless information that comes along with important news, Twitter has pulled away from its gimmicky roots and evolved into a convenient medium for relaying knowledge.

Proposed benefits for USC veterans
After holding out hope that officials in Washington, D.C. could fix a semantic glitch in the Post-9/11 GI Bill, USC decided at the eleventh hour to offer tuition benefits to veterans enrolling as undergraduates or as graduates in the School of Social Work and the Rossier School of Education through a new program.
The Post-9/11 GI Bill promises to cover veterans’ tuition costs at a private college as high as the maximum in-state tuition. In California, however, the Department of Veterans Affairs determined the maximum tuition is $0, because California schools use the term “fee” instead. 
“The state of California has a proud history of not charging tuition — they charge fees instead. So [veterans] are entitled to a $0 benefit,” said Jennifer Grodsky, executive director of USC’s Office of Federal Relations. “It’s really unfortunate. We’re being penalized for our good policy of having no tuition.” 
The difference in wording led schools and members of Congress to challenge the VA’s interpretation, but the VA has refused to amend the problem. 
“Right now California vets are really getting the short end of the stick,” said Katharine Harrington, dean of admission and financial aid at USC. “The VA was unwilling to amend the language when it was pointed out to them that they had made a mistake and so there’s some arm-wrestling going on and it appears that it will continue to go on.” 
Rep. Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) has introduced legislation aimed to change the interpretation. Rep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) sent a letter to the VA endorsed by other members of the House, and California Sens. Diane Feinstein and Barbara Boxer have also sent letters to the VA. 
Thompson’s letter calls on the VA to resolve the problem as soon as possible, saying “the denial of benefits to [veterans] due to word choice is unacceptable and will have real consequences on the effectiveness and success of the overall program.” 
The VA had promised to get a response to the Senate, but no answer has come yet, Grodsky said. 
The continuing process of fighting the VA’s interpretation in Washington led many California schools — USC included — to sit on the sidelines and not apply to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program, an enhancement to the Post-9/11 GI Bill that allows schools to offer a set amount of tuition benefits to veterans, which the VA will match dollar-for-dollar. 
“We didn’t want to hurt California’s bargaining power in Washington over the change that absolutely has to be made so that veterans going to school in California are treated fairly,” Harrington said. 
In the end, USC decided to apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program. Pending approval by the VA, USC will offer 20 undergraduate veterans grants of $2,500 and 10 graduate students at both the School of Social Work and the Rossier School of Education grants of $10,000 — amounts that will be matched by the VA. 
Harrington said USC made the decision to join the program after consulting officials in Washington. USC’s undergraduate tuition benefits are similar to those being offered by other California private schools, including Stanford. 
“We wanted to keep our participation modest at this point because frankly there’s still a lot of moving parts,” Harrington said. 
Despite the school’s “modest” participation in the program, Harrington said a lot of veterans’ tuition expenses are covered by financial aid. In the spring, 101 of the 111 veterans at USC received a grant from the school, and the average undergraduate grant was $39,000, while the average graduate grant was $18,000. 
Still, veterans at USC said relying on financial aid does not offer the same certainty the Yellow Ribbon Program does and could deter veterans from USC and other California schools 
These veterans said they are excited by the promises made by the Post-9/11 GI Bill, but are disappointed by the VA’s refusal to fix California’s base tuition and by the lack of participation by other USC graduate schools. 
“Any school that isn’t participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program is really just hurting themselves and they’re robbing themselves of great students,” said Chris Roessner, a graduate student studying cinema-television production. Roessner also got his undergraduate education at USC after serving in Iraq from 2003-2004. 
Roessner added that even though the School of Cinematic Arts is not participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program, the new GI Bill will still pay for his rent through a part of the bill that covers fees. 
Scott Lowe, a senior majoring in accounting, served as an infantry Sergeant in the Army from 2002-2006. Lowe said he understands why California schools are hesitant to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program, but hopes that more schools will come on board in the future. 
“It is a great program for veterans and schools,” Lowe wrote in an e-mail. “The VA would match every dollar that the school contributed for each veteran. That would save the school half of my grants. I hope that as they see how the Yellow Ribbon Program pans out, that USC will opt to participate in the future.” 
Lowe hopes to earn his MBA from USC, but said this is less likely if Marshall does not join the Yellow Ribbon Program or if the “tuition” versus “fee” difference is not fixed. 
“I’m considering pursuing a master’s degree in the future, and if this problem isn’t fixed, I will be much less likely to attend USC, and I’d be looking to go back east where the costs of an MBA would be covered,” he wrote. 
Grodsky said many of USC’s graduate schools may have chosen not to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program because of the uncertainty surrounding it. 
“There are a lot of unanswered questions about the program so it was hard for schools to choose whether it made sense to participate,” Grodsky said. “I think after this first year we’ll have a better sense of what’s happening.” 
Roessner said he hopes all of USC’s schools will adopt the program. 
“I love the college to death and would never go anywhere else, so I hope they don’t disappoint me,” he said.

After months of swirling rumors, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced Monday that he will not run in the 2010 California gubernatorial election.
Appearing on CNN’s “The Situation Room” with Wolf Blitzer Monday, Villaraigosa cited a need to remain in Los Angeles and see the city through its fiscal crisis and the policy initiatives he has launched since first taking office in 2005.
“I recognize that I’ve got a lot of work to do,” Villaraigosa said on the show. “…And I’ve got to do a better job, even, than the job we’ve been doing in the past four years.”
While Villaraigosa was re-elected in March for his second term as mayor of Los Angeles — which begins July 1 and lasts until 2012 — he only has an approval rating of 55 percent, according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll which asked Democratic voters to rate the performance of potential gubernatorial candidates.
When Blitzer mentioned the statistic to Villaraigosa, the mayor cited a struggling city as the reason.
“That’s what happens when you’re mayor, you’re the focus of the good times and the bad,” Villaraigosa said. “In a time when the unemployment rate is at 12.5 percent, a 55 percent approval isn’t so bad.”
Villaraigosa’s announcement opens the way for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, who announced his gubernatorial candidacy earlier this year, and former California Gov. Jerry Brown, who has not yet announced his candidacy but is expected to run.
Experts say while Newsom could carry young voters who might have otherwise voted for Villaraigosa, because Brown has a strong base in Southern California, he could potentially gain support from Latino, black and elderly voters.
After his appearance on
“The Situation Room,” Villaraigosa told reporters that while he thought he could fix the “abomination” state politics in Sacramento has become, he remained dedicated to Los Angeles.
“I feel like I have my finger on the pulse of what’s broken in Sacramento, but I just couldn’t get beyond the fact that I love this job and I love this city that I was born and raised in,” he said.

Nearly two weeks ago, Iranian students at USC were celebrating voting in Iran’s presidential election but now they’re protesting, asking themselves the question that seems to be on many Iranians’ mind since the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad: “Where is my vote?” 
“The result was very disappointing and shocking,” said Hamid Chabok, president of the Iranian Graduate Student Association at USC. “Everybody became very depressed because no one believed it.”
The June 12 election showed an impressive turnout from Iranians both inside and outside the country, with approximately 1,500 Los Angeles-based Iranians turning out to vote at the designated polling station at the Westin Los Angeles Airport Hotel, said Chabok, a doctoral student studying biomedical engineering who was born and raised in Iran. 
Members of the IGSA gathered before casting their votes to take pictures and celebrate participating in the elections. 
“The students who were living outside of Iran were very interested in voting this time because they felt like they needed a change,” said Salman Khaleghi, vice president of IGSA. 
But less than 24 hours later, Iranian officials announced the re-election of Ahmadinejad by a landslide victory of 63 percent against challenger Hossein Mousavi, who received only 34 percent of votes. 
Khaleghi said he agrees with thousands of Iranians who have taken to the streets of Tehran and other cities to protest the outcome of the election, saying there is no doubt in his mind that the election was compromised. 
Though Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei has announced his support for Ahmadinejad, Iranians have continued to protest in what has become the largest unrest since the 1979 Revolution. 
“The implications of this tug of war will depend on which side shows more resilience and perseverance in this battle,” said a USC professor who asked that her name be withheld. “One side says: ‘You have no right to discount my vote.’ The other says: ‘You have no right to question the election results.’” 
Authorities in Tehran have shut down communication, jamming TV and cell phone signals and restricting Iranians’ access to foreign media broadcasts. 
“I talked with my family yesterday. I can call, but they cannot,” said Chabok, who said he believes Iranian police forces broke the windows of his family home in Tehran and vandalized his father’s car. “My mom said it’s a very horrible, frightening situation now. She was very worried that they are checking our telephone conversations.” 
To compensate for the lack of communication within Iran, Iranians living in the United States have begun using social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter to distribute information about the protests. 
“Because most of the population is young, even though they banned all the communication lines, these young people have tried to find new ways to communicate with the world,” Chabok said. 
Many Iranian students at USC have begun touting the phrase “Where is my vote?” on their Facebook profile pictures to spread the word. They have also been participating in local rallies. 
The most recent protest was held Saturday afternoon outside the Westwood Federal Building. The Facebook invitation had more than 900 confirmed guests and Khaleghi said he expected many USC students and members of IGSA to attend. 
Los Angeles has the largest population of Iranian-Americans in the United States — 500,000 Iranians live in Los Angeles and Orange counties — and Iranian students are the fourth-largest international population at USC. 
While students said they realize their protests will not change the outcome of the election, they hope to send a message to countries around the world that the results should not be recognized. 
“No one in the international community should recognize the results of the election,” said Kaiser, a graduate student studying mechanical engineering who asked that his last name not be used to protect his family in Iran. 
The European Union has already announced that they will not support Ahmadinejad’s victory but the United States has yet to show the same reaction. President Barack Obama spoke out against the Iranian government Saturday, calling the government’s action against protestors “violent and unjust,” according to the New York Times. 
“I understand the U.S. government’s concern,” said Kaiser, who is a dual citizen of the United States and Iran. “This would be a tool — an excuse to oppress the people, crack down on demonstrators.” 
The rallies are also intended to bring moral support to families and friends in Iran. 
“What they need from the international community is their compassion and support and not recognizing this fraud election and this irresponsible government,” Chabok said.
