The baseball team headed north this weekend to take on Stanford in the team’s second series of the year in conference play.
Although they sat one game below .500 entering the three-game set, the Trojans held a 2-1 record in the Pac-12 standings thanks to their series win over California in March. After taking the first game at Klein Field at Sunken Diamond, the Trojans blew a six-run lead on Saturday en route to a loss, setting up Sunday’s rubber game to determine the series winner.
USC took an early lead in the second thanks to an RBI groundout from redshirt junior Reggie Southall. Senior Kyle Davis toed the rubber for the finale and the Trojans’ ace was touched for three runs, scattering five hits and three walks across four innings of work. He ended up taking the loss, as the Trojans didn’t push across another run for the rest of the game, falling 8-1.
“It was obviously disappointing,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “We just need to get better.”
The fourth-year coach said no single part of the team could be blamed for the Trojans’ shortcomings on Sunday.
“They gave us 11 base runners … and we couldn’t take advantage,” Hubbs said. “We struggled out of the ‘pen to hold them down and we made a couple errors to help score some runs for them.”
The series loss comes after the three-game set got off to a promising start. Redshirt junior Joe Navilhon started on the mound for the opener, coming off a career-long, 6.1-inning outing six days earlier against UC Santa Barbara.
The right-hander was even better on Friday, shutting out the Cardinal for six innings while giving up three hits and walking two. A sixth inning RBI single from senior David Oppenheim was the difference in USC’s 1-0 victory, as junior Jeff Paschke and senior Brooks Kriske came on in relief to stifle Stanford’s bats for the remaining three innings.
“Joe pitched fantastically,” Hubbs said. “He didn’t give them anything free. They had to earn everything.”
Hubbs, who earned his 100th career win as a head coach on Friday (all wins with USC), said it was good to record a shutout in light of the team’s recent pitching troubles.
Following up the pitchers’ duel, the Trojans looked to clinch the series win on Saturday, as sophomore Mitch Hart returned from injury to make his first appearance of the season. Hart was on a tight leash after his lengthy absence, and the righty went 1.1 innings, giving up two runs on two hits and two walks. He departed with a 5-2 lead, however, as USC’s bats went wild against Stanford starter Chris Castellanos.
The Trojans tattooed the Cardinal left hander for six runs in three innings and they launched three home runs on the day against Stanford pitching. Junior Jeremy Martinez went yard in the first inning and junior Corey Dempster and redshirt sophomore Frankie Rios homered back-to-back in the fourth to drive in 4 of USC’s total 8 runs, as they raced out to a 6-run lead.
What seemed like a comfortable win suddenly evaporated, however, as the Cardinal roared back to score nine unanswered. No Trojan reliever was able to hold Stanford off the board, and the arms out of the bullpen largely struggled with their control. The Cardinal finished the game with more runs (11) than hits (10), in a shocking loss for USC.
“You can’t take anything positive out of those last four innings,” Hubbs admitted. “We just gave them too much. When you have a team on the ropes like that, you have to make them hit the ball, and they scored five runs on two hits to tie the game.”
USC will hope to turn things around quickly as conference play enters full swing. The Trojans will face off against Pac-12 foes every weekend from now through the end of the regular season, but before resuming the in-conference schedule on Friday, USC will host Pepperdine on Tuesday for the first of two meetings between the programs this season. The Waves’ visit to Dedeaux Field is slated for a 6 p.m. first pitch, and the Trojans will make the trip to Malibu exactly a week later to wrap up the season series.

This past weekend, the men’s volleyball team finished played its last home matches of the 2016 season. On Saturday night, the Trojans  (7-17, 5-15 MPSF) swept the UC San Diego Tritons (5-21, 0-20 MPSF). On Sunday night, USC was swept by No. 14 UC Irvine (9-18, 6-14 MPSF). 
Junior outside hitter Lucas Yoder led the Trojans Saturday night with 11 kills while hitting .450 in the team’s 25-20, 25-17, 25-13 victory. 
Junior middle blocker Andy Benesh and senior outside hitter Alex Slaught both recorded 7 kills. Benesh hit .700 and put up a team-high 4 blocks. Senior Josh Kirchner hit a team-high and personal season-high .857 after going 6-for-7 on kills with no errors.   
As a team, USC hit .414 and served up 9 aces, both season highs. The team had a strong defensive performance at the net with 9 blocks while holding UCSD to hitting only .078. 
The following night against the Anteaters, the Trojans didn’t come out as strong. 
“Coming into this match, it was a do-or-die situation and we came in flat,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “It wasn’t until middle of game three that our sense of urgency returned and we started competing.”
For Nygaard, the slow start was indicative from the service line. 
“Tonight it just wasn’t there,” Nygaard said. “The energy … the urgency … the attitude [weren’t] there.” 
The Trojans finished the match with 29 kills while hitting .231 with 6 digs and 6.0 team blocks. UC Irvine finished with 44 kills while hitting .515 with 20 digs and 8.0 team blocks. 
Sunday night was more than just a match for the Trojans, though. It was Senior Night to honor the team’s four seniors: libero Brooks Varni, outside hitter Alex Slaught, middle blocker Tommy Leonard and middle blocker Josh Kirchner. 
“Tonight is a much larger night than just the volleyball game,” Nygaard said. “It’s a night to celebrate four amazing guys.”
Nygaard reflected on his time with the four seniors. While Nygaard was just named head coach this season, he’s been with the program to see these players grow since they were freshmen. 
“I don’t ever want to think that our time is done,” Nygaard said. “You spend so much time with these guys, you spend you get to know them on a level most people don’t get to and you get to learn from them just as much as they learn from you.”
While the Trojans may have finished up playing at home this season, they’re not finished with the regular season just yet. Their final two matches are against No. 3 BYU on Friday and Saturday in Utah. 
Nygaard spoke about how it’s a “learning experience” for the younger players on the team. With both BYU and Hawaii, the teams play back-to-back matches, so they’re only traveling to the other schools in intermittent years. 
“It’s hostile in that it’s an extremely favorable BYU crowd,” Nygaard said. “I think it’s a great environment for volleyball. I love going there and I love competing there.”
For the younger players, Nygaard sees everything from this season as benefitting the future. 
“Everything we’ve done this year is helping us transition for next year,” Nygaard said. 
USC will finish up their regular season on Friday and Saturday as they head out to No. 3 BYU (21-3, 17-3 MPSF).

This weekend, the women’s water polo team played a double header in MPSF competition. The Trojans hit the road Saturday to face off against No. 20 San Diego State in a non-conference match and then returned home on Sunday to host CSU Bakersfield. The Trojans had a weekend sweep, winning 13-3 over San Diego State on Saturday and 16-3 over CSU Bakersfield on Sunday.
On Saturday, the Trojans (17-0) dominated Aztec territory with junior driver Ioanna Haralabidis firing away the opening goal for USC. Following Ioanna Haralabidis opener, USC demonstrated offensive depth with goals from junior driver Nikki Stansfield, junior 2-meter Avery Peterson, junior driver Stephania Haralabidis, sophomore driver Brianna Daboub, junior 2-meter Brigitta Games and senior driver Melissa Bergesen to bring give the Trojans an 8-1 lead at the half.
In the second half of play, Stephania Haralabidis and Games would tally up three more goals for the Trojans followed by scoreboard newcomers of the day freshman driver Brooke Presten, sophomore utility Annika Jensen and freshman driver Courtney Fahey to solidify a 13-3 win.
Defensively, the Trojans kept the Aztecs in check with freshman goalie Amanda Longan only allowing one Aztec goal in the entire first half. Longan totaled an impressive 10 saves for the day.
The Trojans carried their victorious momentum into Sunday’s home game against CSU Bakersfield, winning 16-3.
The Trojans demonstrated their champion-level athleticism, versatility and speed on both offense and defense. The Trojans carried out a high-intensity counter-attack strategy throughout the game, garnering 7 goals from counter attacks alone. The offense proved to be unbeatable from the two-meter post position, converting 3 more goals for the Women of Troy.
“We had so many opportunities with counter attacks today. We converted a lot, but rushed some missed opportunities,” McKelvey said. “It’s important that we take our time and watch the goalie so we can convert as many opportunities as possible in the future.”
Stephania Haralabidis and sophomore utility Hayley McKelvey kept the intensity high with multiple counter-attack goals each. Stephania Haralabidis tallied 4 goals for the day and McKelvey would add 2 more of her own for the Trojan cause. In the second frame, Jensen, Ioanna Haralabidis and Bergesen would also add on goals to take the score to 6-1 at the half.
In the second half, the Trojans kicked it into high-gear, taking advantage of their speed. The Haralabidis sisters would each have a counter-attack goal with 2 for Stephania. Games also made a name for herself adding two more goals with a lob from the outside and a counter-attack. In the final frame of play, Daboub hammered in another goal and Games added 3 more from the center position with yet another 2 counter-attack goals for Stephania and Ioanna Haralabidis rounding out the final score 16-3 after a pair of last minute goals from CSU Bakersfield.
“Next week we want to focus on recognizing our opportunities on offense and forcing more turnovers on defense,” said Stephania Haralabidis. “We need to keep our intensity high.”
The Trojans will host cross-town rival UCLA next Saturday at 1 p.m.

With the NCAA tournament almost over, and March Madness giving way to April and spring practice, college football is back at the forefront of everyone’s minds. USC football is off to a strong start in the first spring sessions under new head coach Clay Helton. With an incredibly taxing early season schedule next fall, spring practice takes on a little bit more meaning this year.
While every spring there are a few standouts who never translate their early success on the practice field to big time performances under the lights, understanding who will make an impact in the early season gauntlet helps shed some light on the state of the USC program.
The Trojans open up against Alabama and then face Utah and Stanford in two of their next three games, leaving little time to get acclimated to a new quarterback and new coaches. The early season schedule is somewhat reminiscent of Pete Carroll’s second season in 2002 when the Trojans kicked off the year against Auburn and then proceeded to face four consecutive ranked opponents.
The team’s results were mixed in the first five games, going 3-2 but losing both games to Washington State and Kansas State by a touchdown or less. The difficult September and early October set the stage for a phenomenal season the rest of the way, as the Trojans didn’t lose again and capped off the year with an Orange Bowl victory.
That’s not to say that the 2016 season will be the same, but there are some parallels. While this is Clay Helton’s first year as head coach, he was the interim coach for the majority of the season last year and has been around the program for a while. The big difference is at quarterback, where Carson Palmer had a Heisman Trophy winning campaign in 2002 and in 2016 the Trojans will be introducing a new face of the program.
That is not to say that the quarterback can’t make an immediate impact similar to what Johnny Manziel and Jameis Winston made in their debut seasons, but the likelihood certainly isn’t great. Regardless, this spring is showcasing two talented quarterbacks who both offer different elements than what USC is used to the past few seasons under Cody Kessler.
Redshirt junior Max Browne, who was the prized quarterback recruit of the 2013 class, has taken the early lead according to coaches, relying on his experience and years in the program. Cerebral and with a stronger arm than Kessler, Browne has already showcased his knack for going deep and making big plays. While Kessler was incredibly accurate, his fear of making mistakes prevented the Trojans from the type of home-run plays that can swing games and seasons.
Browne doesn’t seem to have a similar fear and that could reap major rewards early in the season, when the Trojans will need some big plays and momentum-turning sequences to hang with the defending national champs as well as Stanford and Utah.
Locked in the battle with Browne is redshirt freshman Sam Darnold, who seems to have the type of gamer profile and natural skillset to possibly be the next great Trojan quarterback. What he gives up in experience to Browne, he makes up for with his rangy athleticism and a rifle arm.
While he may not be as ready as Browne is in terms of playbook knowledge and pure experience, Darnold seems to have the intangibles and an “it” factor that is so hard to quantify but made both Carson Palmer and Matt Leinart — and to a lesser extent Mark Sanchez — such talented college quarterbacks.
As of now it is unclear if Browne will be able to hold Darnold off, or if this will be a similar situation to 2009 when it seemed as if Mitch Mustain or Aaron Corp would get the job because of experience, and Matt Barkley ended up as the starter for the season opener. Either way, the spring has demonstrated that while the first few games might be bumpy, USC’s ceiling for success is higher with either Browne or Darnold at the helm.
Outside of the quarterback position, the Trojans look deep at the skill positions, with a lot of speed and talent across the board. If they are able to shore up both sides of the line during the spring and summer camps, the team could be a force to be reckoned with if they are able to make it out of the first month of the season with few, if any, blemishes on their record.

A weekend trip to the Sunshine State yielded great results for the No. 2-ranked beach volleyball team, who came away with six wins in dominating fashion at the fourth annual Florida International University Surf and Turf Invitational in Miami, Florida.
In the tournament, the Women of Troy (17-2) played three top-10 teams and recorded 5-0 sweeps over South Carolina, Tulane, No. 10 Florida International and Florida Atlantic, while tallying 4-1 victories over No. 8 Georgia State and No. 9 Stetson to add to the third-longest winning streak in program history at 13 matches in a row.
As the lone West Coast team in the field, USC met five of these teams for the first time in program history. However, the defending national champions would make quick work of their opponents in South Beach, losing just two of the 30 total games they played on the weekend.
With six matches scheduled in two days, head coach Anna Collier was pleased with her team’s efforts.
“I thought the girls played very well overall, especially in extreme heat,” Collier said. “It was very hot and there was some good, significant wind out there which was also difficult, but I think they handled all of the elements and all of the matches really well.”
The Trojans started off the tournament on the right foot on Friday morning when they defeated No. 8 Georgia State, 4-1. USC won in straight sets at Courts 1, 2 and 3 to quickly seal the match, while sophomore Jo Kremer and graduate student Zoe Nightingale added another point at Court 5. The lone loss came from No. 4 pair of sophomore Jenna Belton and freshman Abril Bustamante in a tight three-set contest (21-14, 14-21, 18-16).
Two hours later, the Women of Troy earned their sixth sweep of the year with a 5-0 drubbing of South Carolina. Once again, USC’s top three courts dominated their fights to clinch the dual. Wins at the five and four spots followed, with Belton and Bustamante redeeming themselves and outlasting their opponents (23-25, 21-17, 15-13).
To close out the first day of action, a second consecutive sweep was in order as the Women of Troy defeated Tulane, 5-0. All five USC pairs won in straight sets over the Green Wave, with juniors Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler clinching the dual on Court 3 to mark their 10th straight win together.
Saturday morning saw USC face off against the No. 9-ranked Stetson Hatters. In a battle between two of the nation’s undefeated pairs, juniors Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes easily snapped the win streak of Stetson’s Sara Putt and Vendy Strakova (21-11, 21-12) at Court 1 and extended their own streak to 45 matches in a row. The first four USC pairs would win in straight sets, while Stetson narrowly won on Court 5 to finish the 4-1 final score.
In the matchup against No. 10-ranked host Florida International, USC notched yet another 5-0 sweep, all in straight sets. Sophomore Terese Cannon and freshman Katrina Kernochan came away victorious in their first action of the tournament when they swapped in at the No. 5 spot, defeating FIU’s Savannah Davis and Nati Giron by a score of 21-14, 22-20.
The Women of Troy concluded their sixth and final match of the tournament with a 5-0 win over Florida Atlantic, all by way of two-set wins. Cannon and Kernochan secured the first point, Martin and Wheeler won their 13th straight match at the No. 3 spot, and Belton and Bustamante clinched the victory on Court  4. Claes and Hughes also won their 47th straight match and improved to a 22-0 on the season. All in all, the victory marked USC’s fourth sweep of the tournament, their ninth 5-0 win overall, and their 13th straight dual win.
“I’m happy because we don’t get the opportunity to play this many great matches very often,” Collier said. “This [was] some good, good volleyball and to come out so well and on top is just great.”
The Women of Troy will now return home to prepare for the USAV Beach Collegiate Challenge in Hermosa Beach, April 9-10.

The No. 9 men’s tennis team stayed undefeated at home after two back-to-back wins against No. 16 California and No. 36 Stanford over the weekend.
“It was great to open the facility with the energy we had today,” head coach Peter Smith said after the team’s win over the Bears on Friday. “The energy from our crowd transferred to our team. It was just a gritty performance from the boys.”
The clinching point against Stanford on Saturday came from sophomore Thibault Forget on Court 5, propelling USC to a 6-1 win. With the win, the Trojans improved their conference record to 3-1.
The Trojans found themselves down after losing the doubles point early in the match. On Court 3, Forget and freshman Jake DeVine got up an early break before losing the match 6-3 to freshman Sameer Kumar and junior Yale Goldberg of Stanford. On Court 1, No. 38 pair of junior Nick Crystal and freshman Laurens Verboven fell short to sophomore Tom Fawcett and senior Maciek Romanowicz after losing the deciding point at 4-5, giving Stanford the first point of the day.
The singles action saw the Trojans getting the first set on four courts, with the other two close in score. DeVine, No. 109 in the singles ranking, put USC on the scoreboard after beating Kumar 6-1, 6-2 on Court 4. On Court 1, No. 25 senior Max de Vroome was able to upset No. 6 Fawcett in straight sets, 6-3, 7-5.
On Court 6, freshman Jack Jaede was broken when serving for the match and forced to a tiebreaker. Down 0-4, he came back and saved a set point before finishing the match 6-4 7-6(7), beating No. 110 Romanowicz.
Forget finished the match, beating senior Nolan Paige with the score of 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, clinching the dual.
Action went on and the Trojans were able to win the remaining two courts. No. 58 freshman Logan Smith defeated freshman Michael Genender 6-3, 0-6, 6-4. No. 55 Crystal defeated No. 56 sophomore David Wilczynski 5-7, 7-5, 7-5 in a close match that saw the Cardinal serving to close it out in the second set.
On Friday, the Trojans were able to beat the Golden Bears 4-2, after coming from behind once again. The doubles action saw the home team going down as Cal’s No. 44 junior Filip Bergevi and junior Florian Lakat took down USC’s top team of No. 38 Crystal/Verboven 6-0.
The Trojans responded with a win on Court 2 where de Vroome and Jaede tied the score after beating the Bear’s junior Andre Goransson and sophomore Billy Griffith 6-2.
On Court 3, Forget and sophomore Tanner Smith suffered a 6-3 loss to sophomore J.T. Nishimura and freshman Ryan Shen that awarded the Bears the first point of the day.
During singles play, however, the Men of Troy turned it around.
On Court 5, Forget tied the score at 1-1 with a win in straight sets 6-3, 6-1 against No. 62 senior Oskar Wikberg. It was followed by another win on Court 2 where No. 55 Crystal beat No. 40 Griffith 6-2, 6-4. No. 58 Smith pulled out an upset of the same score against No. 17 Goransson, bringing USC one point away from the match.
No. 109 DeVine had to surrender to Bergevi after a close match that ended with the score of 7-6(5) 6-4 for California, recording the only single loss of the weekend for the Trojans. The clinching point came from Court 1, as No. 25 de Vroome fought back after losing the first set to No. 28 Lakat, recording a 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 win.
The Trojans are now 13-4 overall and will play two conference matches on the road, as they face Utah on April 8 and Arizona April 10.

More than 30 organizations came together on Saturday for the USC Community Health Involvement Project’s seventh annual Health Fair at Hoover Street Elementary School. By hosting the fair, CHIP hoped to promote community health and prevent avoidable diseases through providing basic health screenings to the local community. This year, the fair featured a luau-theme along with the free health screenings.
“We have a lot of different booths,” said Danny Le, the administrative director of CHIP. “This includes health-related organizations like the School of Pharmacy, CPR and Hawaii Club to spread cultural awareness.”
CHIP was first established in 2008 by several students to provide underserved communities around USC with basic health screening services and information about prevalent yet preventable health problems. After three years of hosting the health fair on McCarthy Quad, CHIP collaborated with the Los Angeles Unified School District to branch out into the community. Aside from health fairs, the organization hosts an array of events such as fundraisers, basic screening opportunities and training programs for future volunteers.
“The purpose of this whole event is to really bring together all community members with different screenings,” Le said. “That way, we can really educate the community in how to prevent disease, primarily cardiovascular disease.”
CHIP currently has more than 100 active members, consisting of students from different majors and backgrounds.
According to Jessica Thai, administrative director of CHIP, volunteers can just come out and have fun with kids as well.
“We take volunteers from all organizations whether or not they are health majors,” Thai said. “We had a lot of APO [Alpha Phi Omega] volunteers come out and help just setting up canopies, working with the kids. The kids’ booths don’t require any screening knowledge — you can just come out and teach kids about science, buoyancy or nutrition.”

The USC Concerts Committee hosted its annual Springfest concert on Saturday, headlined by Jamie xx. From music to food vendors to the Beer Garden, Springfest brought a multitude of USC students to McCarthy Quad throughout the day.
The event lasted more than nine hours and consisted of several performances and activities. Many students arrived early to check out the multitude of food trucks and vendor booths available such as the famous Jogasaki Sushiburritto and The Boba Truck.
Kid Cadaver, an indie-rock band, kicked off the event with a lively and fun-spirited set that left the crowd pumped. They were followed by solo singer PJ and her band, debuting songs from her new album, Rare. EDM artist, Big Wild, then took the stage as McCarthy Quad started to fill up with excited concertgoers. His stage setup was fairly simple, only a drum pad and a laptop, but with each song played the crowd begged for more, even demanding an encore at the conclusion of his performance. Big Wild was happy to comply and give them one more song.
Following Wild’s performance, rapper Cozz took the stage followed by Grammy-nominated singer Andra Day who gave a soulful performance of her top single “Rise Up,” among others. Hit R&B group, The Internet, took the stage around 7:30 p.m. to change the mood after Cozz and Day. The group, which is made up of many artists with successful solo careers, had the crowd swaying and grooving from downbeat to finale, which highlights a major accomplishment achieved by the Concerts Committee: musical diversity.
Later in the night, R&B legend Jeremih took the stage and wooed the audience with an electrifying set consisting of some of his most popular hits such as “Down on Me” and “Somebody.” The crowd went particularly wild when Jeremih sang his throwback hit “Birthday Sex.” Ending the night was an electrifying and visually stunning set from DJ and remix artist, Jamie xx. From alternative rock to R&B to EDM to pop, there was something in this festival for all musical tastes, and the high attendance rate certainly reflected this.
After his performance, Big Wild expressed his excitement in an interview with the Daily Trojan, despite the fact that the crowd was one of the smallest that he has performed in front of.
“It was cool to play at a college festival because usually I play at big festivals where nobody really knows who I am. But I definitely had a lot of people who knew me and were familiar with my music, and that’s awesome,” Wild said.
He also said that he is gearing up for a two month headlining tour that will conclude with performances at Coachella, and that he looks forward to releasing a lot of new material before the end of the year.
Attendees were impressed with the range of artists performing Saturday.
“They did a really great job this year. When I saw the lineup, I thought, ‘Wow, two headliners!’ Jamie xx and Jeremih are both such big artists right now,” said David Bloch, a sophomore majoring in communication. “The atmosphere is poppin’. Everyone seems very happy with the festival and the addition of GREENHAÜS, and the weather could not be better.”
Springfest’s GREENHAÜS was a popular destination for many of the event-goers. The geodesic dome, which was located at the edge of McCarthy Quad, acted as the side stage of the entire event and was the site of many different alternative activities. Decorated with vines and mist makers, the GREENHAÜS dome hosted an intimate geodesic yoga session, a virtual reality panel and guided meditation. In between these events, the Concerts Committee invited multiple student DJs to perform their sets; such performers included Jynjo, Matt DiMona and Matt Ossentjuk. Beyond showcasing its popular line-up, Springfest organizers this year reached out to student talent and provided them with an opportunity to showcase their work to the rest of the USC community.
Overall, Springfest 2016 was another highly successful festival thanks to the efforts of the USC Concerts Committee.
The event was well-received and garnered praise from students across campus. In a collaborative effort with Trojan Pride, Undergraduate Student Government, Graduate Student Government, Environmental Student Assembly, Special Events Committee and Program Board, the Concerts Committee successfully took on the challenge of bringing together students with diverse tastes in music; moreover, it greatly improved on the negative feedback it received last year regarding the lateness of announcing the performance lineup. Despite the delays in performance times, Springfest 2016 was a remarkable event that highlighted USC’s incredible programming ability for its students. Through its star-studded lineup and innovative GREENHAÜS dome, Springfest 2016 redefined the experience of USC concerts and set new standards for its future events.

Defining and Enriching South-Asian Issues held their fourth session of the semester in the USC Asian Pacific American Student Services office in the Student Union, centered on the topic of love, on Friday. With a small group of students in attendance, the space was casual, yet provided an intimate space for a safe discussion.
At 5 p.m., everyone formed a circle while lounging on couches. The hosts offered snacks and drinks to those waiting for the talk to begin, though there was no actual chai tea, despite it being called “Chai and Chill.” Before beginning, the hosts wanted to ensure there were a few community guidelines kept in mind throughout the hour. They wanted to make clear to each attendee that it was a safe space and to “be intentional, for what you say, the words you use, impact the space you’re in.”
Two girls began the talk with the question of whether or not love exists. Answers varied on the topic of intimacy, sex, family, friends and community, with all different types of love displaying different meanings.
Additionally, the East and West have differences in love, especially in the familial sense, and students opened themselves up to discuss their true feelings on the way love varies. Topics ranged from arranged marriages to the depiction of love in popular Indian films to how being nurtured by family varies in contrasting ways. Common words that arose were “structure,” “tradition” and “communal.” What seemed to be a consensus from everyone in the room was that family and one’s community plays into an individual’s perspective on love, whether that is positive or negative, unintentional or not.
While most students had varying opinions, the conversation was honest and purposeful. Even on more serious topics, students felt they could open themselves up to engage in a powerful dialogue, boldly stating their beliefs. A sense of diversity was shown among these fellow USC students as they welcomed anyone to participate in this conversation on love.
For those interested in attending a chat hosted by USC Asian Pacific American Student Services, go on their Facebook page for more details on upcoming events.

Double standard · Max Landis is well known for his screenplay for the film Victor Frankenstein. The film was both a critical, financial failure. – Photo courtesy of 20th Century Fox
If you told me you’d never heard the name Max Landis, I wouldn’t be that surprised. He is the 30-year-old son of John Landis (the prolific 1980s director responsible for movies like Trading Places and The Blues Brothers) and a screenwriter — and screenwriters aren’t generally famous. They’ve long since been relegated to the back of the barrel when it comes to recognition and reverence in Hollywood, despite their relative level of involvement (especially in film). Television is a different story, but movies are often cited as more of a director’s medium, while the screenwriter is just the guy who hides out in a room for a while and puts words on a page. Landis’ fame reveals a case of gender discrimination in Hollywood.
However, despite the politics around the job, it’s safe to say that Landis could be considered both famous and infamous. The A.V. Club has described him as a “brat screenwriter,” and Landis’ online antics are known to exceed what’s expected from writers (he made headlines back in November when he stated thatAlejandro González Iñárritu’s The Revenant was “the ultimate in cinematic overkill”). His first feature Chronicle was a surprise hit among critics and audiences alike, generating $126 million at the box office — a bonafide success considering its relatively “small” $12 million budget.  In 2015, two more of Landis’ scripts opened in theaters: American Ultra starring Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart and Victor Frankenstein starring Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy. Both turned out to be absolute flops — not only did they underperform at the box office but they were also panned by critics. Landis took to social media to promote and defend his films. And despite the fact that his Youtube rants and Twitter engagements are often retweeted and reblogged internet-wide, it didn’t do much good for ticket sales. Yet this past month Landis managed to make headlines again. On top of the announcement that Bradley Cooper has just signed on to Landis’ new script Deeper, Landis made waves with the news that Netflix agreed to put $90 million up front for his feature Bright — a sci-fi/fantasy film with David Ayer attached to direct and Will Smith slated to star. The biggest shock of all? Landis was reportedly paid $3 million.
With the state of things in Hollywood today, seven figures for a spec script is unheard of. It just doesn’t happen anymore. But beyond that, as German female director Lexi Alexander proceeded to point out on Twitter following the news, such a deal would never be made for a woman. Alexander argued that “no [person of color] or woman writer would get 3 Million dollars for a script after having 2 major box office flops.” She went on to call Landis a “mediocre screenwriter” and credit the discrepancy of jobs among genders as a product of the privilege afforded to white, male screenwriters. Granted, Alexander might seem a little biased — her big studio feature Punisher: War Zone was a relative flop, and she’s had it slow going career-wise ever since. So yes, she might feel really angry toward the Hollywood system at large. But Landis’ talent and Alexander’s cinematic past aside, it got me thinking: Could a woman ever be given that type of latitude? Even further, would she ever be given quite as large of a second chance?
Late last summer, I ran into Landis at a coffee shop. Upon shaking my hand, he asked if I would like to hear an excerpt from the script he was writing at that moment. I responded evenly, unaware of what I was getting myself into. Who would say no to such a proposition? Throughout the next three minutes, he proceeded to perform, loudly and unabashedly, both characters’ sets of dialogue as I stood there silently wondering how on Earth I had fallen into such a bizarre Hollywood situation. I walked away from that experience with one thing for certain: This guy knows how to command a room. He wasn’t afraid to state his mind in front of a dozen or so people. Suddenly, all his antics online made sense. But the question on my mind still is: Is Landis allowed to act out in this way because he’s confident or because men are given more leeway both personally and professionally? If a woman were to rebel and raise hell, would she ever be invited back into the room?
Landis isn’t at fault for the deals he’s been involved with and the scripts that studios have bought. But what he does do is provide a lens which points to the ongoing systemic issue in Hollywood —  it should be considered mounting evidence for a flaw in an industry that many would like to be a part of but find themselves shut out from. Executives, take note.

Isn’t this more a story of bias towards offspring of famous screenwriters?

Controversy is brewing at Emory University over chalk writing in support of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump late last month. Many students claim to be traumatized after seeing “Trump 2016” and “VOTE TRUMP 2016” written in chalk throughout the campus. According to the Washington Post, a group of 40 to 50 students protested the chalk writing in the school’s quad. The leader of this protest shouted, “You are not listening! Come speak to us, we are in pain!” To the student newspaper The Emory Wheel, another student said, “I’m supposed to feel comfortable and safe [here], but this man is being supported by students on our campus and our administration shows that they, by their silence, support it as well. I don’t deserve to feel afraid at my school.”
There are many things wrong with these students’ reactions to this incident. We live in a country that allows someone to support any candidate they want. In a free country, and especially at a university, diversity of thought should be allowed and encouraged. The purpose of college is to encourage the flow of ideas and open debate. When students are exposed to all sides of an issue or different political candidates, they can think critically to form their own opinions.
This incident is a perfect example of how thin-skinned many of today’s students have become. People should be allowed and encouraged to have differences of opinion. If these students are in pain because someone else has a different opinion, they’re in for a great deal of hurt once they get into the real world — because we live in a world with all sorts of opinions. It’s ridiculous to describe this experience as traumatizing. Being exposed to recent terrorist attacks in Brussels or Pakistan is traumatizing — seeing a chalking supporting a presidential candidate is not.
To make matters worse, Emory University President James Wagner, has felt the need to address their concerns and seek out the person responsible for writing the pro-Trump messages. Wagner’s action legitimizes these students’ concerns, and in doing so, sends a message that only some opinions are welcome at Emory. If the pro-Trump student is reprimanded in anyway, Emory will have proven itself to be intellectually oppressive.
Authority figures such as Wagner shouldn’t encourage or give into this kind of behavior. It’s not good for the future of these students. Students need to be exposed to new ideas that will challenge their ideas and beliefs. They don’t need safe spaces in which they can be protected from views in which they disagree with. College is not a daycare center for children — or at least it shouldn’t be. It should be a place for adults to think critically and be exposed to all sorts of ideas.  If the number of young people who act like these students continue to increase, it could have extremely negative consequences for the future of the country. People who break down at the site of “Trump 2016” written in chalk will likely have trouble dealing with the many challenges the world will face as they become the next leaders.
What has happened to young people in America? It’s clear that something needs to change. Millennials need to toughen up and stop being hypersensitive over things like chalkings supporting Trump. Young people need to understand people will have different views from them — and that’s perfectly fine. If people learn to accept that there are many different opinions out there and become strong enough to deal with it, millenials will be better suited to lead and tackle life challenges.
This current climate of “safe places,” “microaggressions” and other whining and crying about being offended by nothing are mind-blowing. A school is no place for bullying, meanness, harsh insults and so on. But “traumatized” by “Trump 2016?” chalked on a sidewalk? Perhaps that would make sense if it were a vicious racial slur or religious insult.
And who are these sissies who are so devastated by perceived “microagressions,” or by others’ contrary opinions to the degree that the sissies are “traumatized?” And why do faculty seem to encourage this notion that extreme mental fragility of college students is a good thing? Maybe I’m too old, but I don’t get it. What do you think is really driving these crybabies and the faculty who support them? I genuinely don’t know.
Best opinion piece written in the DT in a very long time.  The “skinny jeans generation” is in for a serious wake-up call.  
Welcome to freedom of speech. If you get upset over Trump chalk drawings, you are really going to hate the work place, unless it turns out to be your parents basement.
Just for the sake of argument, suppose someone had drawn swastikas all over the school, how would you feel then? Trump is now a symbol of hate and racism too.
Bernie is much closer to Hitler than Trump is, and I see Bernie stickers and posters all over the place #BanBernie

As we all know by now, there’s a presidential election taking place. Well, at least, I hope everyone reading this knows that. Regardless, the outcome of this presidential election will make President Barack Obama a “lame-duck” president come November. The phrase “lame-duck” implies that an elected official’s time in office is soon coming to an end and they have less influence than they did before.
Yet, for me “lame-duck” has taken on a personal meaning. Last week, the University mailed out its acceptance letters to the Class of 2020. There were several videos circulating on social media showing high school seniors learning that they were now part of the Trojan Family. Though I was excited for them, I couldn’t help but feel that they were going to fill the empty seat I was leaving come May 13 when I graduate with my fellow seniors. But let’s not get into that yet.
For now, I am officially a “lame-duck” college student. I know I have to leave, but I’m not yet ready to go. Is this how Obama feels?
I’ve been noticing that while there are dozens of reading materials to teach students how to make the transition from high school to college, there’s a shortage of self-help books to teach students how to survive that final month of college.
So I turned to some Trojans who’ve already made the transition to learn how a “lame-duck” college student still makes an imprint at USC.
For Frances Wang, a 2014 graduate, that last month was filled with a “whirlwind of emotions.”
“I’d see a person or place on campus and flashback to memories of that person or place,” Wang said. “I was kind of over a lot of things because I was a senior, but at the same time, I wanted to do everything one more time because I was a senior.”
Yet, social media carried her through the emotions. In her last month at USC there was no TimeHop, Snapchat geofilters or Periscope.
So Wang used social media by “looking through old photos, seeing other people’s Facebook statuses and reflecting with friends in person by getting together for lunch, dinner or drinks.”
She said there’s still not a day that goes by that she doesn’t think about college.
For Joshua Carroll, who graduated in 2015, he first realized his time at USC was up when he saw the walking tours of admitted students near Tommy Trojan. Yet, he soon realized that the last month of college is much different from the last month of high school.
“Back then, we were kind of all trekking along the same path,” Carroll said of his high school friends. “At the end of college, there’s a lot more uncertainty as we come to another crossroad in our life.”
Carroll, a native of Southern California, is now in graduate school at Columbia University. USC prepared him well for his rigorous Ivy League graduate program. One experience in particular stands out.
During his last few weeks at USC, Carroll opened a friendly reminder email from his professor that informed him he had a paper due in a few hours. After spending a few minutes complaining to Snapchat friends, Carroll whipped out the 8-page paper in a couple of hours. He ended up getting a B+ and saved it for the memories.
The four years of college are filled with curve balls like these. Yet, it seems like only in the end, will we start appreciating how resilient they have made us.
Sometimes being a lame duck in college means that you’re pushed to shift your sights to new horizons. Courtnie Henson graduated in 2015 after studying business and cinematic arts, and knew she wanted to move to New York. Henson is now working at Pandora in the Big Apple.
But she still misses how close she was to all of her friends in Los Angeles.
“USC made my family bigger,” Henson said.
The end of college is a reminder of how much you get to walk away with. As we seniors move through this final month of school, remember how much you’ve grown, the memories that have shaped you, the amazing Springfest concerts that have entertained you, the speakers that have challenged you and the friendships that have aided you during your time on campus.
All of these are experiences we can carry with us past May 13.
Plus, who knows what other amazing things we can pack into this next month? I guess we’ll just have to live and see. Challenge on, Class of 2016.
