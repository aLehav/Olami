I was no older than five when I was asked the dreaded question, “What do you want to be when you grow older?” At the time, I was missing a tooth, entirely too confident and highly naive as I told my kindergarten teacher that I would be the president. My teacher told me I was in for several more years of schooling and education, and by the time recess hit, I was no longer interested in politics. 
The next time a teacher asked that question, I was 10 years older, but not wiser. This time I insisted I would be a fashion designer. I still wear leggings as jeans, so we all know how that went. From that time until I graduated high school, I gave many different answers to that same question — an astronaut, a poet, a journalist, a contortionist, a novelist. 
Now, I’ve grown older, and at 19, I have learned more about myself and the world than ever. One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is that becoming an adult is hard, even harder when I find it incredibly difficult to grasp that I am not the person I thought I would be when I was nine. But at least I am not the only one who feels this way. In a study done by Perkbox Insights, ”96% of adults aren’t now doing the job that they wanted to do as a child and only 4% of adults were successful in achieving their younger selves’ dream job.” That is a terrifying statistic.
At USC, students are surrounded by an array of networking events and panels, a large selection of majors and minors and incredible industry professionals. Seeing students in tailored suits skateboarding down Trousdale Parkway is just another Tuesday afternoon. But one can’t help but wonder when trading desires for dress shoes began. 
While it is essential to pursue your passions, the pitfall lies in not allowing oneself to evolve and grow with those passions. Throughout my first year of college, I was consistently haunted by the idea that I was wasting my life and potential. I switched majors, minors and study areas enough times that I’m sure my advisor grew tired of me — but still, I found myself unsatisfied. I quickly became aware that I was wildly unprepared to dedicate my life to a goal made when I was 13. This revelation nearly sent me into a spiral as I was left wondering: What do I do now?
As time passed, I found myself straying further away from the fear of letting others down as I buried myself in the thought that I was letting myself down. If you’ve ever found yourself thinking the same thing, I’m here to stress that your dreams and aspirations will change — but that does not mean you have failed. Think of it like this, life is a series of crossroads — there will always be paths to take and decisions to make. As we grow, we will evolve — that is simply a fact. If there is anything in life that’s certain, it’s change.
At the risk of sounding like a fortune cookie, I want to emphasize that all paths lead somewhere. After realizing that I could not pursue all the directions my childhood self wanted me to take, regret was soon replaced with anger. How had I wasted all this time chasing something I’d never achieve? Who am I without my old goals and aspirations? I’m here to say nothing is ever wasted when it comes to your dreams — not energy nor time. Maybe you won’t be a congressman by 25 or dancing the Nutcracker as a prima ballerina, but everything you have done and have yet to do will create a life of fulfillment if you let yourself grow out of those childhood expectations. Taking the time to try new things while getting to know yourself is the key to developing new goals. Not every experience will lead to an epiphany, but it will surely add a bit more to your life.
It is a common misconception that giving up means weakness. This is entirely not the case. There’s courage in letting things go to move forward and grow. Following my first year spiral, learning to accept all that I could have done and respecting all of the versions of myself I would never be, led me to finally be able to abandon my childhood pressures. Acceptance and letting go are the cornerstones of change. Maybe this is not the career or life path that a younger you hoped for, but this is the life you chose, and it’s entirely up to you to continue without regrets.
So no, I’m not the president, and I’ll never be the next Anna Wintour, but I am on the path toward new aspirations, and you can be too.

“Don’t get attached.”
Those were my mom’s words of choice when I first told her about my fledgling relationship, months before I was due to set off for college. It wasn’t the advice I had wanted to hear, but it was expected. At the start of my senior year of high school, I believed it was the worst time to get into a relationship. All I wanted to do at the end of my post-grad summer was be released from the shackles of my hometown and start fresh. Never bring your high school relationship to college — I heard that mantra repeated over and over again. Dating someone is hard enough already. As you move into an exciting but turbulent new chapter in your life, adding distance to a relationship from the previous chapter of your almost certainly spells out disaster. And, as one of my friends back home would say, you shouldn’t bring sand to the beach. Why be held back by the commitment of a relationship with an abundance of new people and experiences surrounding you?
But things changed when I met my person  — not to get all cheesy or anything. I found something that I didn’t want to let go of. The decision to go long-distance wasn’t a huge, looming decision for us; it felt like a natural progression. We went into it with a mindset that we might as well try. If it works, it works. If it doesn’t, that’s okay too. 
Fast forward to the present. I’ve just finished my first month at USC, 3,000 odd miles from both my hometown and my boyfriend, and I’ve never been happier. 
I won’t lie. Long-distance relationships can really, really suck sometimes. For one, separation takes a toll on you. When the time difference catches up to me, I’ve spent lonely nights contemplating just how far away Virginia really is. Sometimes, after a long day, all I really want to do is share a hug with him. It’s disheartening to look at a calendar and realize that we still have months of separation left. Not only that, but miscommunication is an all too easy trap to fall into. Conveying emotions is difficult enough as it is, but when relegated to solely online texting and calling platforms, small resentments can be left to fester and grow. 
But you can’t forget about the silver linings. There is a delicate, simple joy in gaining a real appreciation for your partner. Removing physical chemistry and intimacy strips a relationship down to its bare bones. It’s vulnerable and a little scary. You have to navigate new ways to connect with each other. It’s the little moments spent together that have meant the most to me. 
Whether it’s making playlists and group listening on Spotify while working, saving YouTube videos throughout the week to binge-watch together on the weekends, Venmo-ing each other dinner money for FaceTime date nights or even harvesting crops in our co-op Stardew Valley farm, I feel full in my relationship. After taking personality tests and BuzzFeed quizzes and reading in our two-person book club, my relationship feels like self-care. 
Psychology researchers at the University of Denver report that participants in long-distance relationships have an increased propensity towards “relationship adjustment, love for partner, fun with partner, and conversational quality” in comparison to those in close-proximity relationships. Time together is scarce, and therefore more valuable and enjoyable. And, being apart gives room for introspection: thinking about what you really want from a relationship and what kind of support you need. 
It’s really easy to view a long-distance relationship as simply a transition state — a temporary situation — but thinking of it in that way is damaging. A relationship shouldn’t be solely forward-thinking, but rather rooted in the present. 
The cautionary advice that initially made me wary of long-distance relationships simply hasn’t been applicable. I was warned that I would feel held back; instead, I feel grounded. Being in a completely new environment and surrounded by unknowns, it is so comforting to know that I have someone who encourages me, but also makes me feel safe. It’s wonderful to be able to share new experiences with one another, outside of the stifling bubble that university life can sometimes feel like for both of us. I don’t feel constrained; rather, I feel all the freer, carrying my safe place with me even if I’m alone across the country. My relationship makes me appreciate and relish all the new experiences surrounding me even more. 
I’ve learned that my life at college and my long-distance relationship don’t have to be mutually exclusive. They complement and even enhance each other. Being separated across the country isn’t the most desirable arrangement for a relationship, but I wouldn’t change it for anything. I’m in a place that I adore, one that feels exciting and one where I am thriving, and I may be a little rosy — or perhaps blinded by love — but even 3,000 miles apart, I have never felt closer to anyone before.

This past Saturday, the USC and UCLA communities came together to collaborate in service to the Los Angeles community in a citywide service day: Serve LA 2022. USC and UCLA Volunteer Centers organized the event in collaboration with over 40 community partners across L.A.  Volunteers engaged in a variety of projects ranging from beautification to education.
One partnering organization was USC Madhatter Knits, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to knitting hats for babies who were born prematurely. 
“These hats are essential for stabilizing [the babies’] body temperature and allowing them to leave the NICU a little bit sooner,” said Kathryn Huang, president and founder of Madhatter Knits and a senior majoring in civil engineering (building science).
By taking part in the Serve LA event, Madhatter Knits hoped to expose their mission of advocating for preemies to a broader community. 
“We do center around donating our hats to low-income areas, especially those who don’t have the financial means to support so many things,” Huang said. “So using these hats, we kind of serve as more of an emotional support as well as a sign that the community is thinking of them.” 
Over 20 volunteers arrived Saturday to knit Halloween-themed pumpkin and candy corn hats. The volunteers sat together, filling the room with conversation and laughter as their fingers and hooks weaved through the circle loom — creating the stitches of a hat. 
“This is my first volunteering event with the volunteer center, so I didn’t really know what to expect,” said Malaika Jamal, a junior majoring in cognitive science. “But I was pleasantly surprised. I thought this club was really cool, really easy, great instructions and I actually made really nice friends right off the bat.”
Volunteers, such as Jamal and Bryneé Evans, a junior majoring in psychology, said they intend to keep volunteering with Madhatter Knits in the future. 
“I like how hands-on it is because people have to do work to get it done,” said Evans.  “I also like the message of Madhatter Knits because I think it’s really important and it’s nice that we get to help babies and make hats for them.”
In addition to serving community members of all ages, volunteers also worked with four-legged friends. One animal-focused organization that volunteers collaborated with was Wags and Walks, a 501(c)(3) all-breed dog rescue based in L.A. 
In addition to saving dogs, Chloe Esperiquette, Wags and Walks’ development and marketing manager, said that the organization aims to educate the community about “how amazing rescue dogs can be.” 
On Saturday, around 15 volunteers walked and played with the dogs to keep them happy, healthy and comfortable outside their kennels as the dogs waited to meet their “forever families.” 
“[Our founder] moved out here to L.A. and started volunteering with organizations and realized just how many dogs were being put down in shelters really for no good reason,” Esperiquette said. 
Wags and Walks offers opportunities to walk the rescue dogs from the shelter, handle the dogs at various events and advocate for the dogs. Volunteers can also do “freedom runs” from the shelter to the adoption center, and help transport the dogs to veterinary appointments from the shelter. Those interested in spending more time with the dogs can also look into fostering the rescue pets anywhere from a week to months, a service which saves lives.
Volunteers also served the community outside of USC’s campus and into the downtown Los Angeles area. The Los Angeles Public Library collaborated with LA librería and REFORMA Los Angeles to host the Los Angeles Libros Festival, a free bilingual book festival for children, teens and their families. 
Tatiana Ortiz Cordonero, the community outreach librarian at the L.A. Public Library, explained the happy coincidence of the second day of the festival falling on the same day as Serve LA, and her excitement in inviting college students to join the event. 
LA Libros Festival, the largest bilingual book festival in L.A., was the first large event that the library hosted since reopening to the public. Throughout the event on Saturday, attendees enjoyed entertainment including Spanish-language and bilingual storytelling, performances, workshops and award-winning authors. Volunteers welcomed attendees, brought out photo booths, helped with arts and crafts and overall provided support in bringing the event together. 
On Friday, the library also hosted a virtual version of the event in partnership with 21 schools across the city. Through streamed sessions in classrooms, students connected with authors and music and interacted with arts and crafts sent to the schools the week prior.
Isabella Ramirez, L.A. Public Library’s volunteer engagement librarian, said “college students are 10 times one of the hardest demographics to get to the library.” 
“People think libraries are just buildings with books, but there’s so much more to it, and this is such a great opportunity to get a younger generation to see exactly what we do,” Ramirez said.

USC’s Office of the Provost released a communitywide statement via email Friday morning in its latest response to the disaffiliation of several fraternities from the University’s Interfraternity Council. The statement addressed recent disaffiliations, announced the completion of the final report from the Working Group on IFC Culture, Prevention and Accountability and promoted a FAQ page for community members to read if needed. 
USC once again — the first time being in an Instagram post on Aug. 12 — expressed its disappointment that eight fraternities — Tau Kappa Epsilon, Beta Theta Pi, Pi Kappa Alpha, Kappa Alpha Order, Lambda Chi Alpha, Sigma Chi, Zeta Beta Tau and Sigma Alpha Mu — had “ended their relationship with [the] University” and, later in the message, discouraged students from “attending events at or joining” any of the disaffiliates. 
In the past month, two additional fraternities, Phi Delta Theta and Phi Sigma Kappa, joined the new University Park IFC, which also houses the eight previously disaffiliated groups, while maintaining their affiliation with USC IFC.
Included in the statement was an 11-page report created by the Working Group on IFC Culture, Prevention, and Accountability composed of student representatives from the USC IFC, Panhellenic Council and Undergraduate Student Government, as well as faculty and staff members, on the next steps to create a safer environment for students when engaging with Greek life organizations. 
The group — created last November following allegations of sexual assault and druggings within some fraternities — met “two times per month from November through April, including a half-day Saturday retreat in March.” In January, the group created and released a preliminary action plan to resume activities within fraternities after they had paused in November. 
The report has multiple sections devoted to elevating current standards, enhancing prevention education, improving compliance, next steps and broader campus work. It promises the implementation of the Fraternity & Sorority Strategic Leadership Committee, with the aim of evaluating “the progress and next steps to supporting culture, prevention and accountability.” 
The FSSLC will be comprised of “students from all five fraternity and sorority communities, subject-matter experts, and individuals with authority to assess trends and determine action steps for addressing accountability and well-being goals.” Also touted in the report is the expansion of a committee “to address sexual violence at the university level.” The group will include faculty, students and stakeholders, and will brainstorm a “multi-year action plan” for USC. 
The report also listed a revised list of standards for fraternities wishing to throw parties that were implemented in the Spring 2022 semester, which include wristband distribution for those over 21 and identification of those under 21, security guard placement at entrance and exit points and at stairwells and hallways leading to bedrooms, utilization of license scanners to screen for fake identification, meetings with Department of Public Safety to align expectations and the establishment and implementation of a ratio of security guard to guest. Elevated standards for pre-and post-party planning and debriefing were also laid out in the report. 
The statement’s last paragraph was devoted to announcing a FAQ page “to address common questions we have heard from the community.” The FAQ site contains answers to questions such as “How do fraternities operate at USC?,” “Why did they disaffiliate?,” “How should someone report allegations of misconduct or other prohibited activity at a disaffiliated organization?” and more.
Correction: A previous version of this article referred to the timing of the IFC Working Group’s preliminary action plan incorrectly. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Defying the odds, the king is back. Rapper LUCKI, who has been prevalent in the underground scene since 2015, gifts fans with an album titled “FLAWLESS LIKE ME,” a 54 minute project featuring 24 tracks and appearances by rappers Future and Babyface Ray. By releasing “FLAWLESS LIKE ME,” LUCKI has not only crowned himself as the king of the underground rap scene but also solidified a spot in the mainstream rap conversation. 
LUCKI’s last album,  “WAKE UP LUCKI,” was a collaboration project with producer F1lthy. Using F1lthy’s electronic style trap beats, LUCKI was able to mainstream a sound heard throughout the underground since the album’s release in 2021. However, being a highly anticipated release, “WAKE UP LUCKI” didn’t perform as expected. Being that LUCKI’s lazy flow was absent throughout the project, it’s only natural that “WAKE UP LUCKI” was not a fan favorite. 
But in the first track of “FLAWLESS LIKE ME,” fans are relieved to hear LUCKI’s lazy style flow return. “MADE MY DAY” not only intrigues listeners with the mellow style trap beat but also allows fans to process each and every lyric because of his slow and paced flow. This flow continues throughout the album in songs such as “GEEKED N BLESSED” and “BEEN A MINUTE”. 
On “KAPITOL DENIM,” we see one of two collaborations on this album, with rap superstar Future featuring on the track. While a captivating and intriguing song and fan favorite, the track gives fans an insight into what consistent collaborations with A-tier rappers would sound like. LUCKI’s flow throughout the song resembles that of rapper Roddy Ricch in a way that is more of a melodic flow. On “KAPITOL DENIM,” LUCKI seems to preach to listeners instead of speaking to them in a descriptive formative way. 
On the album’s other feature, LUCKI manages to give fans a collaboration that listeners never knew they needed. LUCKI’s collaboration with rising rapper and one of this year’s XXL Freshman Babyface Ray on “WHITE HOUSE”  allows the listener to hear the duo over a Detroit-style trap beat. This Detroit style is heavily influenced by an easygoing lyrical flow and sharp bass-boosted beats. Being that “WHITE HOUSE” is one of the most streamed songs on “FLAWLESS LIKE ME,” LUCKI’s experimental beat choice can be labeled a success.  
Apart from the beat, it’s almost as if LUCKI took on the role of a Detroit-style rapper to record this song in the studio. Everything about this track is reminiscent of the motor city, from the flow to the lyrics. With the amount of success that this choice of style had, it wouldn’t be surreal to expect LUCKI to collaborate with Detroit-style artists such as BabyTron and Tee Grizzley. 
“DNA,” the album’s tenth track,  is one that LUCKI connoisseurs have heard months before the release of the album. “DNA” features an all too familiar chorus, which was leaked about a year ago and released on SoundCloud and Youtube. Once again, fans hear LUCKI’s lazy flow, but  instead of a dark electronic style beat, fans are introduced to a morning sunshine type of beat. The beat gives the listener a sense of optimism that is quickly clouded by the dark meaning behind LUCKI’s lyrics. 
What establishes the success and timelessness of “FLAWLESS LIKE ME” is its ability to feel short and insufficient, despite being 24 songs. LUCKI cracked the code on supply and demand. LUCKI was able to give hungry fans 24 tracks, each with its own unique beat, style and flow. But despite the long track list, the abrupt end to the album leaves listeners and fans with the feeling of wanting and needing more. 
Even with the feeling of incompletion that “FLAWLESS LIKE ME” brings to listeners, the album not only lived up to its expectations, but reminded those who doubted LUCKI’s consistency that he is not only a rapper but an artist as well. 
For the entirety of 2022, rappers such as Destroy Lonely, Ken Carson, Yeat and others have been overlooked by many. Despite putting up more streaming numbers than certain “mainstream” rappers, the term underground is still placed upon them. In releasing “FLAWLESS LIKE ME,” LUCKI gives listeners another reason as to why the term underground should be removed from the description of certain rappers. 
Overall, 2022 has been an emotional year for rap fans. With albums such as Kendrick Lamar’s “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers” and Future’s “I Never Liked You,” it is hard to say where “FLAWLESS LIKE ME” sits in the album of the year conversation. The only thing that can be certain is the ability for “FLAWLESS LIKE ME” to be mentioned in the conversation, creating a resonating sound for all listeners, giving it the versatility to be considered mainstream and establishing LUCKI’s presence in rap.

Fashion week is just about to end in Milan, with an array of high-end designer brands showcasing their new pieces for Spring-Summer 2023 and high-profile celebrities in attendance. With stars such as Brent Faiyaz, Normani, Leonardo Di Caprio and Kim Kardashian, the pull fashion week has on the world is apparent. Another celebrity in attendance to note is Zlatan Ibrahimovic, A.C. Milan’s striker, who is currently recovering from an ACL injury and pulled up to see what’s all the fun.
This article isn’t about fashion week in Milan though. The purpose of this is to highlight the recent transition of athletes becoming ambassadors for these designer brands, primarily in soccer.
Throughout history, sports brands tend to stick with players to represent their company, and designer brands have shied away from having athletes represent them as ambassadors. There’s the typical Nike and Adidas deals with superstar names signed to them, like the LeBrons, Ronaldos and Messis of the world. Recently though, that has started to change, mainly in soccer, where players like Jack Grealish and Karim Benzema are being named as ambassadors for Gucci and Fendi, respectively.
Grealish’s deal with the Italian fashion brand was one that shocked many, with Gucci signing him to a seven-figure deal, joining up with the likes of Harry Styles and Jared Leto along with others in this high-profile group. It was a bit of an odd one to look into considering the Englishman isn’t revered as the star of his team, Manchester City, with many giving Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne that title. 
However, Grealish’s off-the-field antics have garnered a lot of attention and spotlight in English media, with his style and popularity reminiscent of that of David Beckham. He’s been seen as England’s it-boy for some time now, not only because of his stellar performances back when he was at Aston Villa, but also for his fashion and charm. With his pull, it’s clear to see why Gucci signed the 27-year-old, as he is one of the most marketable athletes in the U.K.
The aforementioned Benzema struck his own deal with Fendi three weeks ago to be their ambassador for the Fendi Faster Sneaker. Not only is the Frenchman known for being one of the best in the world right now, as he’s touted to win the Ballon d’Or this year, he’s also one of the more fashionable players out right now. He’s already had some collaborations with other brands and designers, like Jean Paul Gaultier, and Fendi just adds another to his fashion resumé.
Many other soccer players have gotten deals to sponsor or appear in designer brands, like Heung-min Son and Marcus Rashford’s respective partnerships with Burberry, and Hector Bellerin, who walked at Louis Vuitton’s Paris Show for Spring-Summer 2020. Bellerin is known as sort of fashion pioneer in the soccer world, with many looking at the Spaniard as the most fashionable baller out. Not to forget French superstar and potentially future G.O.A.T. Kylian Mbappe, who became an ambassador for Dior back in 2021.
It’s out of the ordinary for these brands to go for athletes to represent their name, as they tend to go with popular and/or fashionable musicians, actors and other celebrities to sport the brand. So why the change?
For starters, these players already have a large presence on social media. Mbappe has 72.6 million followers on Instagram and Benzema has 58.1 million. While Grealish may not have the same type of numbers, with only 5.3 million followers, he tends to have the traditional media’s eyes on him a lot. Along with that, these players star in their respective leagues and the UEFA Champions League, garnering the eyes of the viewers on soccer’s biggest stages.
Looking at Dior’s half-year report, they’ve seen a 28% increase in revenue from last year. Could that be due in part to Mbappe’s deal and his social media presence having value? Who knows, but from what is visible, it hasn’t done them any harm in making that deal. 
In terms of the soccer side of things, it gives the players a lens outside of their athletic talents. People want to see what these soccer players are wearing on social media because they have that notoriety of being fashionable. It doesn’t really put more eyes on screens for games; it’s moreso giving fans another way to connect with their favorite players.
All in all, the fashion industry has more to gain from this collaboration with soccer players than vice-versa. These deals are miniscule in comparison to these players’ salaries for their clubs. Grealish’s current contract at Manchester City has him making £300,000 a week, which makes the million-dollar deal with Gucci not look as impressive in comparison. It’s a marketing tactic for these designer brands to keep the public’s eyes on them and not lose their position at the top spot.

Women’s volleyball dominated crosstown rivals UCLA Thursday, earning a 3-1 win. The Trojans set the tone for the evening, winning the first set 25-22 and the second set 25-21. Sweeping the Bruins was at their fingertips for most of the third set, but UCLA won it by the skin of their teeth with a score of 29-27. Ultimately, USC picked up a Pauley Pavilion victory after winning the fourth set 25-21. 
The Trojans stepped onto the court confident with a three-game winning streak under their belt. Thus far, the team had earned an impressive 9-3 overall record, with UCLA being the first conference game of the season. The Bruins entered the day’s matchup with a 6-3 record overall, coming off of a 0-3 loss to the University of San Diego. Beginning their Pac-12 fight with crosstown rivals set the stage for an action-packed game. 
In the first set, the sea of blue made their presence known as they chanted for every play. 
“I love playing in front of big crowds like this, even when they’re booing us, I use that as a motivation,” said freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson. “We really use that to push through this game.” 
Both teams’ desire to win was apparent as they matched each other kill-for-kill and dig-for-dig in the first set. Ultimately, USC won the first set 25-22, with every point a hard fought battle. With 17 kills and 9 digs, the Bruins could not keep up with the Trojans fighting spirit. Eight of those kills were earned by senior outside hitter Skylar Fields. 
After winning the first set, opposing chants rang through the stadium. 
“If they are booing us, let’s prove them wrong,” said Wilson. “If we lost this point, let’s get this next one.” 
This mentality remained true throughout the second set as USC once again displayed a dynamic performance. While UCLA led the second set in the beginning, after a timeout, USC found their rhythm and pulled ahead to win the set 25-21. The Bruins’ nine kills were no match for the Trojans’ 14. 
For the third set, the Trojans started off strong, leading throughout until the Bruins tied the game at 18-18. Relentless rallies and impressive movement on both sides made set three a tense yet thrilling one to watch. The Bruins won the set 29-27. 
“UCLA just touched the ball a little bit better and made that extra touch or play that allowed them to escape and get out of it,” said former UCLA coach and current USC Head Coach Brad Keller. “I felt good going into the fourth set of our mentality, who we were and how we were playing.”
Despite the set three loss, Wilson remarked that the Trojans used it as “motivation to carry into the fourth set.”
“We are gonna take over this. We are gonna shut them down,” Wilson said on the team’s mentality entering the fourth set. 
Late in the fourth set UCLA challenged a play, but officials ruled in favor of USC, keeping the score at 20-15 with USC in the lead. The Trojans held on to that lead and won the final set 25-21. 
The first Pac-12 game of the season for the Trojans featured a record-setting audience at Pauley Pavilion, creating a thrilling atmosphere. 
“I think anytime you have two rival schools getting after each other it always just adds a little bit more to it. It was a packed house, it was a great vibe,” said Keller. 
The Trojans returned to Galen Center on Saturday, but lost to Washington State in 5 sets. USC sits at fifth in the Pac-12 standings with a 9-4 overall record. They will host Colorado University next Saturday at 7 p.m. at Galen Center.

Oh God, midterms are coming soon.
Thinking about it, I don’t feel ready to tackle them. Maybe all the time I spent playing video games instead of studying during the heatwave is finally coming back to bite me in the butt. Oh well, since I still have a week until my first scheduled test, I’ll just let future me worry about it. Certainly a foolproof plan with no chance of backfiring. 
So, while we’re still technically in the “beginning” of the semester, I’ve been taking things slow, paying attention to what has been going on in the esports scene. And I am happy to say that everything is… completely crazy. I feel like this past week has been the most drama-filled in esports since I started writing this column. 
Of course, this isn’t a drama or gossip column. As much as I’d like to talk about top Twitch streamer xQc revealing his breakup with his girlfriend over a livestream in front of thousands of people (yes, really), it doesn’t factor into the topic of this column. Still, there are a couple of things that happened that have wider implications for the industry. And it all has to do with Twitch.
For those of you who don’t know, while Twitch is the main platform where gaming live streams occur, it also houses “Just Chatting” streams that have nothing to do with games. And, while the website continues to be a mainstay in gaming culture, these other streams are the driving force behind the website nowadays, so much so that gaming streamers and even esports athletes usually also do “Just Chatting” content to increase their affinity with viewers. An unexpected consequence of this, however, is that wider decisions on the website end up affecting the gaming community as well, making those athletes’ lives harder. 
This ended up being the consequence of the recent “ItsSliker” drama. A famous United Kingdom streamer, Sliker played various games on stream, but mostly did variety content. None of this matters, however. The reason why we’re talking about Sliker is that he recently admitted to swindling thousands of dollars out of different streamers and fans to fuel his gambling addiction. And while none of that gambling occurred live on Twitch, the fact that his addiction made him go to such lengths struck a chord with various creators, who demanded that Twitch ban gambling on its platform.
That may not sound controversial, but you have to understand that many big streamers showcase a lot of gambling content on their channels, with some even having them as a centerpiece of their content. This means thousands of viewers are exposed to this activity, creating a dangerous slippery slope into addiction. Streamers realize this, but keep this content going because they gain so many subscriptions (read: money) during the streams. And, whenever someone subs, Twitch gets a cut. You can start to see why this is a complex issue. Still, Twitch decided to listen and effectively banned gambling on the platform.
The reason why this is important to talk about is that it highlights one of the core tenants of any successful industry that often gets overlooked: communication. For the first time in what seems like forever, Twitch finally listened to its audience and adapted its policies based on popular demand instead of through internal discussions. Even more important is the fact that this bites into Twitch’s revenue, which suggests that the company is truly hoping to foster a better environment on its platform. So while the gambling ban may not be an indication of drastic change for all creators, this decision represents the interests of small and big streamers alike, as they finally may have their wishes and desires heard.
That is if Twitch hadn’t screwed things up the very next day. And here we reach the second point of “drama” presented this week: Twitch’s reevaluation of its sub-share. After riding the good comments and positive PR for one night, Twitch posted a message on Twitter announcing that, unlike the 70/30 system that was previously in place for big creators, all subscriptions regardless of channel size will now be split 50/50. Very briefly, for every subscription a channel gets (which costs about $5 on the platform), creators will now get half of the money and Twitch will get the other half. In their message, Twitch cited operating costs as a leading factor behind this decision. Still, many were quick to point out that their message may not contain the entire truth, and even then, shrinking some of their departments might have been a better move — especially considering the heavy push its competitor YouTube is having on live streams. 
So, while I originally designed this column as a sort of twist, where all the drama makes you not expect the nice result, Twitch just had to ruin it. Instead of representing the best in communication, Twitch once again proved to be extremely inept in understanding its audience. It’s worth mentioning again that, aside from the disregard that Twitch has shown its community, small streamers also looked at the 70/30 split as an ideal ratio they would one day have. Of course, this makes the decision even more of a spit in the face, as their hopes just got crushed in front of them. 
For Twitch, this doesn’t bode well, as more and more streamers are considering making the switch over to YouTube, especially now that these splits have been revisited. Still, it definitely is not the end of the company, as they still have a good number of advantages over their competitor. That, however, isn’t a permanent thing, and if Twitch continues to exhibit this current attitude, constantly compromising its streamers instead of fostering bonds with its community, we might see a different number sooner than expected.

Correction: A previous version of this article stated that xQc broke up with his girlfriend on a livestream instead of revealing that they had already broken up. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.
