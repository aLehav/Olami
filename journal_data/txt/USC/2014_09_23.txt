Something very unusual happened this weekend in the world of USC sports. While the football team’s loss to Boston College last week is still hard for me to wrap my head around — even after the bye week — what happened three days ago was almost just as interesting.
The men’s water polo team lost. Twice.
I jokingly texted Daily Trojan sports editor Aubrey Kragen that head coach Jovan Vavic must now be on the hot seat and we could expect to see him fired after another slip up, but she quickly caught my sarcasm. Nonetheless, the men’s water polo team has been so dominant across the country in recent memory and set such a standard for excellence that anything less than perfection brings attention.
The Trojans are the six-time defending NCAA national champions. Read that sentence five more times to fully appreciate how ludicrous, preposterous, outrageous, absurd, illogical and nonsensical that number is. LeBron James promised Miami Heat fans that he would win “not six, not seven” championships and ended up with two. Two more championships for the Trojans and the team can make an absolutely priceless parody of that LeBron video.
The team was off to an undefeated start through 10 games this season, including a big 10-3 win in a rematch of last year’s national championship game against Pacific, but a matchup against UCLA in the semifinals of the Kap7 NorCal Classic tournament hosted in Stockton, California, resulted in a 9-7 loss for the Trojans. Adding insult to injury, Cal then snuck out of the consolation game with an 11-10 win, and the Trojans ultimately finished in fourth place.
The poor result at the tournament shouldn’t be as surprising as the football team’s loss to an unranked BC team — all four of the semifinalists at this weekend’s tournament happened to be the top four teams in the country according to the most recent Collegiate Water Polo Association poll. The pair of defeats is still very noteworthy, though, because it would seem to validate the fact that USC isn’t the top-ranked team of those four.
Stanford is the No. 1 team in the country, but fell in the tournament final to No. 2 UCLA by a score of 9-7. USC sits at No. 3 in the nation, with Cal rounding out the top four. Though there may be a pair of leapfrogs in the poll, the top four will likely remain intact.
The rankings and results from this tournament indicate that there is a tremendous amount of parity within this quartet. USC’s perennial dominance would imply that the exact opposite was the case for the last six years, but looking at the Trojans’ regular season performance during their title run shows that regular season defeats are actually normal.
The 2008 and 2012 teams went undefeated, but the other four title runs featured bumps in the road against the same three teams.
In 2009, the team’s only two losses in the regular season were to the Bruins, but the Trojans beat UCLA that year in the national championship game. In 2010, the team lost to Stanford and Cal during the regular season, but beat the Bears for the title. In 2011, the squad lost to Stanford and two losses to UCLA, but the Trojans again beat UCLA in the ultimate game. The 2013 season, when USC beat Pacific in the final, also featured two losses to UCLA and one to Stanford, plus a loss to Pacific.
Think you can guess who faced USC in the grand finale in 2008 and 2012? Stanford, then UCLA.
A look at the box scores from the national championship games further shows how crazy USC’s title run has been. The 2008 game was a two-goal win, 2009 was a one-goal win and 2010 was a two-goal win in overtime. The 2011 championship was the most comfortable margin of victory as a three-goal win, but the last two have been one-goal games, with last year’s going into overtime. So that’s one three-goal win, one
Looking even further at the seven times USC has lost to UCLA in the past seven seasons, including 2014, all of the prior six of those games have been one-goal games, and two have come in overtime.  Yet the Trojans have found a way to beat the Bruins three times in national championship games when it mattered most. Let’s just say they’re aren’t just our rivals in football and men’s basketball.
So if we take anything away from this weekend, it should be that everything is just fine at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. Besides maybe Vavic’s blood pressure.
The national title streak is going to end at some point, and it could very easily be this year. In fact, if you believe that the Trojans are about equal with the other three California powerhouses and this run can only be attributed to crazy good luck in the final moments of the last six seasons, then it would be almost mathematically impossible for the Trojans not to lose their crown this year.
But you can’t possibly attribute six straight years of unprecedented success to just luck. There’s something special in these Trojans or in the way Vavic prepares them. Somehow, the pressure of the playoffs brings out the best in the team. That mentality isn’t worth much, maybe one or two goals over the course of a game, and yet that subtle distinction is the difference between a dynasty and irrelevance.
Vavic will end this season far from the hot seat. In fact, the team could probably lose every game the rest of the season and he’d still have his job because he’s proven to be the arguably the best coach in all of college sports. Nothing seems to indicate yet that this team is any different than it has been the last six years because of a graduation or any other factor, so I still think the program will win its seventh straight ring. Vavic might barely have his head above water when the season ends, but hopefully that happens when the Trojans win it all one more time and he gets pushed into the pool during the celebration.

On Tuesday, the 18th-ranked Trojans participated in their first full-pad practice of the week as they prepare to host the Oregon State Beavers following their bye week.

Bye Bye Week
Following the Trojans’ 37-31 loss at Boston College on Sept. 13, they had a full bye week to tune up their mental game as well as their physical preparedness for the tough Pac-12 games ahead of them.
“Everyone takes a deep breath rather than being in the hurry up and panic mode, praying for our next opponent,” redshirt senior tight end Randall Telfer said. “We got a lot of teaching, especially for the young guys.”
Learning from their loss was a big emphasis this past week for the Trojans.
“We don’t condone in victory what we wouldn’t condone in defeat,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “We’ve been hard on our guys since day one, because we all want to be successful on Saturdays.”
This hard-nosed approach to the game will show itself in Saturday’s competition with the Beavers as Sarkisian gave some final thoughts regarding Tuesday’s practice.
“The guys were really efficient,” Sarkisian said. “It was a hard, physical practice, which we need. All in all, it was a positive Tuesday.”
The energy at practice Tuesday was all about preparation to compete at a high level. The team is ready to get back on the field and redeem themselves.
“Coming off a loss, you’re hungry to hit someone again,” Telfer said. “During the bye week we’ve just focused on ourselves.”
Beaver Fever
The Trojans have split the last six games against the Beavers (3-0, 0-0 Pac-12). USC beat Oregon State 31-14 last year in Corvallis, Oregon, and have not fallen at home to the Beavers since 1960 — a streak of 22 games.
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, who threw for 247 yards and a touchdown last year against the Beavers, praised Oregon State’s defense.
“They are really experienced on defense, they don’t make a lot of mistakes,” Kessler said.
This is in part due to the fact that every defender starting for the Beavers is a junior or a senior, which will create an anticipated matchup between such a veteran defensive line and a young offensive line for USC that finally showed its inexperience against Boston College, allowing five sacks.
“A lot of teams might look over [Oregon State], but we don’t,” Telfer said. “They are a very physical and well-disciplined team.”
Sarkisian has stressed the importance of never overlooking an opponent since the quad fell to unranked Boston College. This will be especially important this week, as the Beavers head into the matchup this weekend with wins against San Diego State, Hawai’i and Portland State.
Mannion Madness
Oregon State quarterback Sean Mannion is getting attention across the country, and nowhere more so than here in Los Angeles, as the Trojans are preparing to face one of the most highly touted senior quarterbacks in the country. Sarkisian referred to Mannion as the “prototypical NFL quarterback.”
Mannion is averaging 301.0 yards per game this season and has thrown four touchdowns. His mileage is especially impressive considering his top target last year, Brandin Cooks, is now catching passes from Drew Brees and making his case for the NFL’s Offensive Rookie of the Year.
There is no doubt that Mannion has absolutely flourished under the command of coach Mike Riley.
Sarkisian also credits Mannion with forcing teams’ secondaries to communicate and make quick decisions.
“He throws such a great ball down the field,” Sarkisian said. “It will be a great test for us.”

After losing three of its last four matches, including two on its home court, the USC women’s volleyball team sought its first home victory of the season when crosstown rival UCLA made the trip to the Galen Center on Tuesday night.
Sam I am · Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio tallied a team-high 12 kills along with five digs in Tuesday night’s match against the Bruins. The Guadalajara, Mexico native hit .233 on the match and had no service aces. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
USC (7-3) came into the match ranked No. 9 in the nation while UCLA (9-2) was ranked No. 20. Though the Women of Troy held the upper hand in the rankings, the Bruins ran away with the win, sweeping USC, 25-23, 25-13, 27-25.
The match started off very close, with 16 ties in the first set. In fact, neither team led the first set by more than two points until the Bruins took a 23-20 advantage late in the set. The Bruins would go on to win the first set by a slim 25-23 margin.
The Bruins seemed to ride some momentum into the second set, jumping out to an 11-6 lead. After a timeout, the Bruins expanded their lead and never looked back, winning the set 25-13. UCLA controlled almost every aspect of the set. One major category where the Women of Troy continued to falter was service errors — they had six service errors in the second set alone.
In the third set, the Women of Troy didn’t let the Bruins go on a big run, but the Bruins worked their way to a 20-13 lead. Senior outside hitter Emily Young was brought into the game and USC began a remarkable comeback, tying the set 23-23 a few minutes later. But the comeback would be for nothing as USC would eventually drop the third and final set 27-25.
After the game, Young talked about her opportunity to make a difference during the third set.
“I was fortunate to be put into a position where I was able to give all that I could to my teammates,” Young said. “I was put in a role where I knew I had nothing to lose. I knew when I looked at every girl in the eye out on the court, I knew they wanted to win and I knew that we could do it. I just kind of laid it all out for my team. ”
Junior outside hitter Samantha Bricio also had some comments regarding the play of the Women of Troy and what they need to do to start winning games again.
“We need to create energy because our attitude is always like a flatline and we don’t get excited,” said Bricio. “We need like, as a team, to bring more energy.”
UCLA’s Karsta Lowe was unstoppable throughout the match, tallying 22 kills and six digs. For USC, Bricio led the way with 12 kills, and she also collected five digs. Freshman outside hitter Lauryn Gillis had six kills and five digs in the match, while sophomore outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu added six kills and two digs.
As a team, the Bruins outperformed the Women of Troy in nearly every category. The Bruins had 11 more kills, 16 more assists, 11 more digs and nearly a 10 percent better hitting percentage than the Women of Troy. The Women of Troy had two more team blocks than the Bruins, but they also had seven more service errors. With the loss, the Women of Troy fall to 7-4, with all four losses coming in the last five matches. The Women of Troy are still winless on their home floor with an 0-3 record, but look to rebound Friday against Arizona State at the Galen Center.
Head coach Mick Haley admits his team has a lot of work to do to improve.
“The first six [games], we played decent teams, but they’re not the quality of Florida and UCLA and Wisconsin,” Haley said. “They are all top 10 teams. If we’re going to be a top 10 team, we have to beat some of these teams. We’re not a top 10 team right now.”

In response to students’ requests for fresh, flavorful meal options, USC Hospitality has introduced new on-campus dining venues, menu offerings and products.
Going with the grain · The new grain station at Seeds provides wholesome, flavorful vegetarian meals that are made to order. This is one of several upgrades made across campus to various dining establishments. – Maral Tavitian | Daily Trojan
“As we continue to listen to feedback from students, we are adjusting our process and products to add more healthy options on campus,” Director of Hospitality Dirk de Jong said.
The Café at the new Wallis Annenberg Hall provides a casual, Italian-inspired dining experience. Manager Max Lopez developed the concept for The Café after traveling to Napa Valley over the summer. Lopez said that he gained inspiration from the honest, ingredient-driven cuisine served at institutions such as Bouchon Bakery and the French Laundry.
The menu at The Café features simple fare made from high-quality ingredients. The best-selling three cheese panini consists of gooey mozzarella and provolone, sun-dried tomatoes and olive tapenade, all sandwiched between crusty Asiago cheese bread. Packed with colorful fresh vegetables and tossed in a subtly sweet champagne vinaigrette, the kale and farro salad is ideal for a light lunch.
The Café also serves coffee and espresso drinks by Illy, an Italian company that sources its beans sustainably. By offering customers the option of enjoying their coffee on-site, Lopez hopes to reduce waste and create a vibrant café culture.
“We want students to feel the difference of how coffee tastes in a porcelain cup,” Lopez said. “Another key thing to be focused on is cutting back waste. We do plates for-here and all of our to-go packaging is made from recycled materials.”
Seeds Marketplace, a bustling lunch destination located inside  the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, unveiled three new offerings. The grain station provides wholesome, flavorful vegetarian meals that are made to order. Chef Edward Rodriguez explained the objective behind the grain bowls.
“This station before was sausages and hot dogs and crepes, and for the longest time we thought that that didn’t match the Seeds concept of food that could be modified, vegetables, freshness and grains [based],” Rodriguez said.
The Mediterranean, Southwestern and chili-garlic bowls incorporate bold ingredients and seasonings.
“Instead of simple, original flavors, we went for a lot of ingredients, like eight to 10 ingredients in each item,” Rodriguez said. “But it really brings out color, flavor profile and freshness into the scene.”
Sweet Lucie’s, an organic ice cream company founded by USC alumna Geri Czako, opened up its first scoop shop at Seeds. Czako started making ice cream at home while pregnant with her first child, Lucie.
“When I was pregnant with Lucie, I was like all other first-time moms, really into ‘how’s my baby developing,’” Czako said. “I realized that whatever I was eating affects my baby, so I started an organic diet. And of course, like most pregnant women, I was craving ice cream, so the two had to eventually combine, and I started making organic ice cream at home back in 2008.”
Czako began serving her ice cream at pop-up events throughout Los Angeles, quickly gaining a cult following that landed Sweet Lucie’s at Whole Foods in 2010.
Seeds offers fan favorites such as salted caramel and dark chocolate, along with an exclusive flavor called Trojan Swirl. The festive flavor combines creamy vanilla bean ice cream with fresh strawberry and mango sorbets.
DRNK Coffee + Tea, a sustainable coffee company with retail locations throughout Los Angeles, took over the coffee program at Seeds. Appealing to students serious about their morning cup of joe, the three custom blends are ground on-demand.
“Coffee drinkers really get what we do,” said Boris Horvat, director of Operations for DRNK.
Tucked into the basement of the Musick Law Building, the Law School Café introduced a new Asian-inspired menu featuring hearty rice bowls and boba tea. Associate Director of Special Events, Sales and Marketing Erika Chesley said that boba tea has drawn many undergraduate students to the quaint dining venue.
“We’re expecting boba here to take off in the same way that smoothies and juices took off at Nekter,” Chesley said.
“We’re almost doubling our sales from what we had before,” said manager Olivia Ortega-Sanchez. “The demand is there because kids want boba.”
The pork, salmon and vegetarian rice bowls provide a flavorful and cost-effective lunch option, combining carbs, protein and vegetables all in one.
“We worked on the bowls all summer to get a flavor profile,” Rodriguez said. “Do we want creamy, hoisin, sweet, sour, spicy, hot? Well, we figured out that we wanted all of them, so we kind of put them all together in a bowl and they really complement each other.”

Spider-man and X-Men creator Stan Lee visited USC Tuesday to discuss his career and achievements. The 91-year-old sat down with Daily Trojan Lifestyle Editor Daniel Grzywacz to talk about the recent popularity of Marvel movies, Marvel’s success in comparison to DC comics’ struggles and even which of his superheroes he’d like to  be.
Excelsior! · The man who helped create hundreds of superheroes like Spider-Man, The Avengers and The X-Men talked about topics including Marvel’s recent success and who would win between Hulk and Thor. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan 
 
Daily Trojan: Thanks for taking the time to sit with us, Stan.
Stan Lee: It is pretty damn nice of me. (Laughter).
DT: I’ll dive right in because we don’t have much time. Marvel is at an all-time high, because of the movies, which have brought a complete influx of fans. Why do you think it’s exploding now, as opposed to before? I mean, Marvel’s been around for so long.
SL: Well, the reason now is they’re able to do the special effects in the movies that they weren’t able to do years ago. If we had done movies of Spider-man or Thor years ago, it wouldn’t have been as effective. We couldn’t have had Spider-man swinging on his web through the city and make it look as believable. Then with all the techniques we have today they can make the most fanciful super-story with giants and monsters and other dimensions look believable and credible to an audience, and that’s why. And also, Marvel has better stories than anybody else.(Laughter).
DT: Well, I can’t argue [with] that. They’ve managed to make movies, make stars out of a whole bunch of characters, including Guardians, who were completely obscure. Even many die-hard Marvel fans hadn’t heard of them a couple years ago.
SL: A lot of people hadn’t heard of them! I hadn’t heard of them! And somebody reminded me that I made up the name. I don’t remember having done that, but anyway, it did very well. Probably because of my cameo.
DT: That’s the real reason why the movies are blowing up, I’m sure. O.K., we’ve got Doctor Strange coming up, Ant-Man and you said Black Panther was in the works?
SL: I wouldn’t be surprised.
DT: Are there any other characters that you would like to see, that you would think —
SL: Oh, I would like to see all of them, but I think we’ve covered most of them already. I may have to go out and invent some new ones. (Laughter).
SL: I’d like to see the Silver Surfer come back again and I’d like to see a Fantastic Four movie where Doctor Doom is shown the right way and Galactus is done the right way. But that’ll happen.
DT: Yeah, they didn’t even actually show Galactus.
SL: No, they didn’t know how to do it. Now they can figure it out.
DT: Another thing about the Marvel movies is that we can’t have Spiderman and the X-Men and the Fantastic Four with the Avengers. Do you think that they will eventually be able to come together?
SL: Probably not. Because as long as they’re successful, the different studios that have the right to distribute them will never let that right go. Unless the studios themselves decide to join in and do a movie of both of them, but it’s a little bit unlikely. It’s a shame.
DT: It is a shame. Marvel is also diving again into TV now.
SL: Oh with, um, S.H.I.E.L.D.
DT: Yeah with S.H.I.E.L.D. and Daredevil is coming up. Will we get to see a cameo with you?
SL: Well they’d better! (Laughter) The only thing I’m annoyed about, I wish they had done Daredevil just a few years earlier so I could’ve played the role (Laughter) I think I would’ve been great as Daredevil. I mean, I can’t hear that well now. (Laughter)
DT: O.K., Another thing is that Marvel is exploding compared to the DC movie universe, which has made some hits, but for the most part hasn’t reached Marvel’s success nearly as much. And they’re doing the Batman and Superman film coming up, but do you think that they’ll be able to catch up [to Marvel]?
SL: No. I’m known for my very interesting responses. No.
DT: Why do you think they’ve fallen so far behind?
SL: ’Cause the people at Marvel are smarter. I’ll give you an example: We used to be called Atlas Publications and when I saw that the books were doing so well I said, “Let’s change our name. We need a better name.” And I’m really into advertising. When I used to read magazines like the Saturday Evening Post I’d read the ads first and then the stories, so I said, “If we get a name like Marvel we can have little sayings like ‘Make mine Marvel’ and ‘Welcome to the Marvel age of comics’ and ‘Marvel marches on.’” And I’d use those when I was writing and treated everything like a big ad campaign. Well, DC, when we changed our name to Marvel they were known as National Comics and they must’ve thought “Well, if Stan Lee changed the name we’ll change our name.” So they decided to change their name, too. And what did they come up with? We were Marvel! They came up with D.C. And you wanna know why we beat them.
DT: Ha, fair enough.
SL: And they’re friends of mine, too!
DT: I’ve got some fun questions now. If you could dress up as one of your creations for Halloween, who would you dress up as?
SL: Probably Spider-man because it’s a skintight suit and it would show off my heroic figure. (Laughter).
DT: If you could have any one of the superpowers you created, which one would it be?
SL: Oh, I think I’d want to be, not because of his superpower, but I’d wanna be Tony Stark. ’Cause he’s incredibly wealthy, indescribably handsome, the women love him and yeah, being Tony Stark wouldn’t be so bad.
DT: Who would win in a fight: Thor or Hulk?
SL: It would depend on who’s writing and who he wants to win. You see, this may come as a shock, but those are fictitious characters.
DT: Alright, what if you were writing the story?
SL: Well it would depend. If I were writing it as a Hulk story the Hulk would win. If I were writing Hulk as a guest star in the Thor series, Thor would win.

President C. L. Max Nikias, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett and Vice Provost for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry hosted student affairs vice presidents from 35 universities in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom on Monday and Tuesday for a conference to discuss issues related to sexual misconduct on college campuses.
The conference was a result of Nikias’s desire for USC to take a leadership position on the issue of sexual misconduct, Carry said. Following the annual meeting of Association of American Universities presidents this past summer, Nikias invited each AAU university to attend a conversation at USC to discuss sexual misconduct. The conference was also enumerated in the seven initiatives to address sexual misconduct that Garrett announced in a memorandum on Aug. 27.
“The provosts and presidents usually get together, but this is the first time the vice presidents got together,” Carry said. “They spent a day and a half strictly on sexual misconduct on college campuses — almost two days of conversation on that single topic. It’s the first time that has ever happened, and it happened here at USC.”
The group discussed a report from the White House Task Force’s to Protect Students from Sexual Assault, bystander education — including the latest federal government campaign, “It’s On Us” — sexual assault climate surveys, existing and pending legislation, and prevention education.
Though USC and many AAU universities at the conference already have sexual misconduct prevention education programs in place for incoming students, a new topic of discussion was the idea of implementing an education program for all four years of undergraduate studies.
“There was this realization that no one has a four-year education module, and there is a call to action,” Carry said. “Our assignment for the next year is to collectively build a four-year educational module that’s digestible, smart, witty and that involves student input and feedback so we can make sexual misconduct education not just a one-time, new student experience but something students are reminded of every year.”
The 45 conference attendees also listened to presentations from experts in the field of higher education and sexual misconduct. Event speakers included Brett Sokolow, president and CEO of the NCHERM Group, LLC; attorneys at law Leslie M. Gomez and Gina Maisto Smith of Pepper Hamilton, LLP; Sharyn Potter, co-director of Prevention Innovations; and Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education president Kevin Kruger.
Following this conference, it was decided that the AAU vice presidents of student affairs will continue to gather annually to discuss Title IX and other student affairs-related issues.
“Five years from now we may have gotten to a place where we resolved some of these issues, but there are always issues about Title IX and a variety of issues in this area that students affairs vice presidents work for on behalf of their student bod[ies],” Carry said.

Retired Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Bernard J. Kamins spoke at the Gould School of Law on Tuesday as part of “Spirit of the Law,” a guest speaker and lecture series put on by the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
The  series, which is co-sponsored by the Levan Institute for Humanities and Ethics and the Office of Religious Life, highlights various legal professionals who have found personal meaning in their law degrees and have used their degrees in unique, innovative ways.
“Hearing the personal stories of these speakers, we can reflect on our own journey,” Varun Soni, dean of religious life, said in his introductory remarks.
Soni, who is a UCLA law school graduate, reflected on his time in law school and how he and his classmates would engage in stimulating conversation in the hallways but never had a forum to hold those discussions. He described the Spirit of the Law series as a centralized way to hold discussions and an opportunity to show students interested in the law what a law degree can provide them.
Kamins, who graduated from the USC’s law school in 1968, spent 17 years as a public defender before becoming a judge and stressed the importance of respect and character in the courtroom.
“I see my job as not having a big ego but being humble and respectful of the people who have come before me,” Kamins said.
Kamins, who presided over the Rodney King police brutality case for a short time during his 22 years on the bench, has dedicated his life to the service of others, advocating for the treatment and rehab of criminals in place of harsh punishment. Kamins cited the statistic that it costs $35,000 a year to place someone in jail but only $6,000 to offer someone a year of rehab.
Kamins also worked with a prostitution diversion project, which is aimed to help women, mostly of international descent, who are brought to the United States under the belief that they will work in massage parlors. The women are then forced into prostitution by their employers, who have control over their passports and visas.
“The criminal turns out to be the victim,” Kamins said.
Instead of charging them, Kamins ordered the women to complete a program that provided social services and the help they needed to successfully find employment outside of the prostitution rings.
“It’s better to take these people out of terrible situations and put them into ones where they can feel a sense of pride and belonging,” said Kamins, who called himself a judicial activist.
Kamins said he always opens up his classes at Pepperdine, where he is an adjunct law professor, by teaching students that the most important tool a legal professional has is his or her integrity.
“The real thing you have to bring into the courtroom is your character and trustworthiness,” Kamins said.  “What I’ve learned is that when someone is in front of me, I don’t need to show how much power I have. I have to show how humble I am and how much humility I have.”
Though Kamins is now retired, he still presides over cases statewide in a program known as the Assigned Judges Program. The program allows retired or active judges to preside over cases that lack judges due to vacancies, illnesses or other judicial congestion issues.
Kamins said he wakes up every morning, looks in the mirror at himself in his judge’s robes and is excited about the work he does.
Students were impressed by Kamins’s work on the bench.
“It was a very humbling experience,” said Melanie Franceschini, a freshman majoring in political science. “The judge had many important lessons to teach us about what it’s like to be a judge, like how you should be humble and not impose your power on people.”

Students gathered in Hahn Plaza on Tuesday for a National Voter Registration Day event, which aimed to encourage student participation in the upcoming midterm elections this November.
Get out the vote · Alex Kanegawa, a sophomore majoring in print and digital journalism, registers students to vote in Hahn Plaza on Tuesday. – Liliana Scarlet-Sedano | Daily Trojan
The event was co-hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, USC College Democrats, USC College Republicans, Undergraduate Student Government, Political Student Assembly, Asian Pacific American Student Assembly and Asian Pacific American Student Services.
The event featured guest speakers from the local political sphere. Commissioner Mike Davis, Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer and California Republican Committeeman Shawn Steel spoke at the event about the importance of student involvement in the upcoming elections.
Unruh Institute Director Dan Schnur introduced the guest speakers and stressed the importance of bipartisan cooperation in politics.
“These speakers may all be selecting different candidates for governor in November, and their ballots may look completely different, but they all ultimately want what is best for the community and for students,” Schnur said.
Historically, younger voters have had lower turnout rates in both general and midterm elections than other eligible voters. In the 2010 midterm election, the turnout rate of eligible voters aged 18-29 in California was 27.8 percent, compared to 52.9 percent of eligible voters aged 30 and up.
Alec White, president of the USC College Democrats hoped that the event would help increase voter turnout for USC students in order to make sure that student voices are heard in government elections.
“It’s definitely important for students to vote in the midterm elections because politicians generally don’t know what we want,” he said. “It’s important to get them to listen and to look at the issues that students are having more closely.”
Jennifer Massey, president of the USC College Republicans, highlighted the power that students can have in elections.
“Millennials really would have a large voice if they would all come out and vote,” Massey said. “In the last elections in particular, in 2008 and 2012, they came out in really large numbers to vote for the president and other candidates and they really showed how strong they can be.”
On Election Day, Nov. 4, polls will be open at several locations in the community surrounding USC, with maps and signs directing students where to vote. There will also be shuttles to various polling locations throughout Los Angeles.
Various student organizations tabled at the event. Additionally, every student who pledged to vote on Election Day was entered into a drawing for USC prizes, including t-shirts and gift cards.
Massey also hoped that the nonpartisan nature of the event would provide an opportunity to educate students about different political ideologies.
“My main goal, in general with all of these events, is to try to show the students on campus both sides of issues,” she said. “I just want to give students the facts from both sides and allow them to decide for themselves what they believe.”

Chairman Emeritus of Marvel Comics and esteemed comic book creator Stan Lee discussed his professional accomplishments, chatted about the Marvel Universe and joked around with a capacity crowd at Bovard Auditorium Tuesday night at the Stan Lee: A MARVELous Mind event hosted by the Speakers Committee.
David Belasco, co-director of the Lloyd Grief Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the Marshall School of Business, moderated the event and lauded Lee for his innovation in the entertainment industry.
“[Marvel fans make up] this community that’s been built [since] before there was social media,” Belasco said. “You were actually a pioneer in this.”
Lee told Belasco about his experience growing up in the Bronx during the Great Depression. Lee worked a series of odd jobs as a teenager before eventually being hired as an office assistant in the comics department of a publishing company at 17. By 18, Lee’s supervisors had been fired, and he was single-handedly running the department.
Lee said at first he was embarrassed about working as a comic book writer, so much so that he decided to use an abbreviated version of his name.
“I kept wishing I could get out of it,” Lee said. “I was so embarrassed about working on comic books that I didn’t want to use my real name because I thought one day I would use it to write the great American novel.”
Lee attributes much of his success in comics to luck and to the artists he worked with throughout his career, including acclaimed comic book artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko.
Lee said that one of the reasons he believes Marvel became so successful was his implementation of a new method for creating comic books. Instead of sending a first draft of a story to an illustrator for that illustrator to interpret, Lee would explain the story he hoped to write to the artist, and after receiving the finished product, he would add the dialogue, captions and sound effects based on characters’ expressions or the scene depicted in the illustration.
“The artwork and the dialogue constituted one illustration in a sense, and that’s why our stuff, I think, did better,” Lee said.
Lee also joked about Marvel’s rivalry with fellow comic book publisher DC Comics, the company behind superhero characters such as Superman and Batman. Though Lee explained that he respects DC’s work and is friends with many people at the company, he said that Marvel often sets the comic book trends, only for DC to follow.
Lee shared an anecdote to illustrate the differences between the companies.
“I tried to be incredibly scientific in our stories,” Lee said. “For example, when Superman flies, he has no visual means of propulsion. Now take Marvel: I wanted Thor to be able to fly, so I found the most scientific method you could find. He takes his hammer, which is attached to his wrist by a leather strap, and he twirls the hammer as fast as a propeller and then it just goes up into the air — but he’s attached to it.”
Though many of his characters have endured for many years, Lee believes that everyone can relate to superhero comic books and movies, which allows them to remain popular today.
“All of us loved fairy tales when we were young,” he said. “We loved stories of monsters and witches and dragons. We loved those stories, and that’s why fairy tales have endured forever. Superhero comics are the closest things to fairy tales for grown ups. You sort of recapture the fun you had when you were a little kid.”
According to Belasco, three of the 20 highest-grossing movie franchises of all time and two of the 10 highest-grossing movies of all time are Marvel films.
The event concluded with a Q & A session with Lee and students in the audience. Students asked Lee about his thoughts on the Marvel movies, the diversity of the Marvel Universe, his favorite heroes and his own cameos in the films.
Lee said that he expects that all the characters he has created will eventually be incorporated into films. He also mentioned that he is working on several projects internationally with his media production company, POW! Entertainment.
Lee, 91, said he has no plans to retire.
“I’m happy doing things,” Lee said. “It’s very important to do things. It doesn’t matter what they are, just do them.”

The ever-heavy topic of racism’s presence in our judicial system is impossible to ignore. Though there might be more laws in place to protect minorities from structural and hypothetical discrimination, it’s all too easy for racism to present itself in practice.
Last week, Django Unchained actress Daniele Watts was arrested in Studio City after a fellow citizen called the police on her and her boyfriend, Brian James Lucas, for engaging in a “sexual act” in a parked vehicle. Watts said they were only kissing and claimed that the officers had accused her of being a prostitute solely because of her skin color. Lucas agreed. According to CNN, Lucas stated in a Facebook post that he believes the police saw “a tatted RAWKer white boy and a hot bootie shorted black girl” who they assumed “were a HO (prostitute) & a TRICK (client).”
In the audio gathered from the scene by TMZ, it is clear that Watts said, “Do you know how many times … the cops have been called just for [me] being black … and he’s white?” After Watts refused to give the police officer her identification, which he claimed he was allowed to demand, the police officer then asked, “Who brought up a race card?” and that he “said nothing about [Watts] being black.” The audio then continued with Watts refusing to cooperate with the police officer, because she felt she had done nothing wrong in simply showing public affection.
Some argue, however, that this case isn’t about racial profiling. According to ABC News, at a meeting last Friday civil rights activists demanded that Watts apologize to the LAPD. They believe the profiling claims were erroneous after reviewing several TMZ photos and audio.
“We took her word that she had been a victim, but now we know it’s not true,” said Najee Ali, president of Project Islamic Hope. “So we feel that she has done a disservice to the community and especially those in the civil rights community who backed her claim initially.” In the same vein, Earl Ofari Hutchinson, president of L.A. Urban Policy Roundtable, said, “We cannot stand for just anyone to just scream and shout ‘racial profiling,’ ‘I have been victimized,’ ‘I have been targeted’ if that’s not the case.”
Though footage released by TMZ doesn’t definitively confirm that this was indeed a case of racial profiling, activists such as Hutchinson and Ali shouldn’t immediately assume the opposite and say, essentially, that she had been lying about being a victim. There’s really no pressing reason to disbelieve Watts’ story. If she felt that she had been racially profiled or victimized, others have no right to force an apology out of her. In an interview with CNN, Watts said that even though the whole incident could have been over within just a few minutes if she had cooperated and given the police officer her ID, she believes she did the right thing in standing up for herself.
It doesn’t take much work to look at the past horrors of incidents such as the Rodney King or Michael Brown cases to know that racial profiling is a serious issue in our country. Watts shouldn’t have to give proof of her victimization to share her side of the story and have people acknowledge it. Some could argue that it was unnecessary for Watts to insist on bickering with the police officer instead of just cooperating, but her actions are a part of a fight to end racial profiling — and she has nothing to apologize for.
Chelsea Hernandez is a senior majoring in English (creative writing). Her column, “Foot in Mouth,” runs Wednesdays.
 
As other readers have already indicated, the writer could not be more wrong in her assertion.  Ms. Watts most certainly should apologize – profusely.  The very fact that racism is so ugly and real when it actually occurs is why we must not tolerate people throwing it around so lightly.  The police responded to a call, as they are required to do. The police have every right to request identification when called to a scene, and we the public are required to cooperate in that request… even if you’re black.  It seems to me that Watts and her boyfriend should direct their anger or frustration to the morons who phoned the police in the first place.  They might have a valid argument against whomever that was… though it is quite possible the person who phoned the police is guilty only of being a prude.
True racism is ugly, immoral and hateful.  Accusing someone of racism without merit is just as bad, and wholly undermines the efforts to combat it.
Rodney King was racially profiled? As I remember, he was driving drunk at high speed, and led the police on a high speed chase. No doubt they beat the crap out of the guy, but he put himself on their radar.
As a black woman, I feel that Ms. Watts is an embarrassment to all Black people.  Have you seen this jezebel’s Facebook page.  Filth.  She was NOT kissing her white massa of a Bf- she was ridding his shrimp dick a broken down looking MB.  Jezebel has zero class.  You’re a scumbag for defending her.  
Oops not sgt jim
You glossed over and more importantly, ignore the fact that the police were summoned to the location as a result of a call from another citizen who obviously saw more than “a public display of affection” going on.  Your premise is completely based on false foundation.
Ms. Watts is a liar.  More than 1 call came into LAPD REGARDING THE PUBLIC FVKING THAT WAS GOING ON.  
How do you know that Sgt. JIM?
“If she felt that she had been racially profiled or victimized, others have no right to force an apology out of her.” 
You mean other than the fact that it could damage the careers of the officers who did not racially profile her? Just because you thought you were being targeted by race does not mean that you are, and it’s not OK to throw allegations out like that unless there is a real reason for it. The officers were responding to several complaints, so if there was racial profiling going on, it was the people who called in the complaint and not the police officers. 
Did they overstep their bounds in asking for an ID? That is a question worth asking. Were they racially profiled by the officers?  Not from what I saw. She should apologize for slandering the cops in the news and on social media, and should only focus on whether they had probable cause to check her ID. If they did not, then it is perfectly acceptable to file a complaint on those grounds.
the lapd officer is an openly gay man.  the other officers: 2 women, 1 hispanic.  racism my arse. 
Right.  Because he likes boys he also likes other races?  Hispanics love blacks and so do women.  I dont get it.

Early last week, Urban Outfitters committed yet another fashion crime, a scandal that demands urgent customer awareness. The retail behemoth insulted the nation and college students with the sale of a “one-of-a-kind” vintage Kent State sweatshirt. The $129 sweatshirt’s bloodstained pattern harkened to the 1970 “Kent State massacre,” in which the Ohio National Guard opened fire on a group of students, killing four and wounding 10.

Needless to say, the Internet has been abuzz with outrage at the company, which has grown increasingly notorious for its controversial merchandise. Popular sites including Forbes and the Huffington Post have since reported on the tastelessness of the sweatshirt, with Forbes accusing the company of “indifference, bordering on antipathy” toward shoppers.
The online retaliation was so widespread that the company promptly apologized via Twitter, explaining that the sweatshirt was part of a “sun-faded vintage collection.” According to the tweet, the pattern was not meant to represent blood spatter; rather, the “red stains are discoloration from the original shade of the shirt and the holes are from natural wear and fray.”
Perhaps this faux pas would seem like more of a genuine accident if this were an isolated incident. A short video by the Washington Post gave viewers on a glimpse of some of the company’s most appalling gaffes, a collection of disgraces that includes a gray v-neck t-shirt with the message “Eat Less” printed across the front and a yellow t-shirt with a blue Star of David embroidered on the pocket. The first shirt received backlash for its apparent apathy toward those with eating disorders, and the second was criticized for evoking Holocaust-era Jewish uniforms. A similar slideshow by Huffington Post Canada includes these products in addition to a greeting card with a transphobic message that uses the words “closet tranny” in a parody of the Jack-and-Jill poem, and a button-down Henley available in the color “Obama/Black.”
Forbes writer Clare O’Connor hit the nail on the head with her article’s title, “Urban Outfitters’ Real Scandal: Its Disdain For Its Customers.”  After all, this new scandal, with the context of founder Richard Hayne’s comments, renders the company’s blunders all the more sickening. In her article, O’Connor quotes Hayne’s 2013 statement to his analysts, in which he pinned the company’s target consumer as “the upscale homeless person, who has a slight degree of angst and is probably in the life stage of 18 to 26.”
Aside from revealing blatant insensitivity toward homelessness, Hayne’s statement reaffirms the company’s lack of tact. Hayne and his company presented a sweatshirt making light of a college massacre to a college-aged market. The whole concept seems more of a sick joke than an actual business venture.
In a recent statement on its website, Kent State responded to the sweatshirt fiasco. “We take great offense to a company using our pain for their publicity and profit,” the statement reads. “This item is beyond poor taste and trivializes a loss of life that still hurts the Kent State community today.”
It is precisely this disregard for public reception that renders this incident so atrocious. Whether or not the company actually embellished the sweatshirt with fake bloodstains, the blatant connection is undeniable and wholly unacceptable. There is a definite distinction between making a statement and the commodification of tragedy; band t-shirts and transparent tank tops are bold, but making light of murder is simply tasteless. There is nothing coincidental about Urban Outfitters’ repeated trivialization of some of the nation’s most vulnerable memories and heated topics, and this offense begs for consumers to take a step back and reconsider their purchases.
Of course, it’s one thing to verbally condemn the fat cats running a corporation and another thing entirely to stop purchasing clothing from one’s favorite store. Still, Urban Outfitters’ insensitive merchandise creates a tangible bond between the corporate leaders of the company and the consumers. A Huffington Post article by Jamie Gottlieb cites the results of the 2014 Millenial Impact Report, which found that  “people born in the ’80s and ’90s place high value on social change and participation in volunteer work.” Since the company disregards values its target audience cherishes, it is up to the customer to take a stand.
“As a generation that supports change, social justice and healthy body image, Urban Outfitters continually tears away at what millennials value most, then promotes it in the form of overpriced t-shirts,” Gottlieb said.
Worded that way, it seems as though Urban Outfitters endorses the absolute worst aspects of American culture for the sake of material gain, and — to say the least — this is not okay. It’s actually terrifying that the company has been able to sell so much to a market whose ideology it has butchered time and time again.
Urban Outfitters can apologize and play innocent all it wants, but it’s time consumers took matters into their own hands. It might be slightly harder to find the perfect vintage-style crop top at Forever 21, but perhaps it’s worth supporting a company with a better value system.

The ISIS has posted a jeopardizing video, executing a British aid worker David Haines, making him the third contemporary victim. In analogy two other western captives James Foley and Steven Sotloff, American journalists were decapitated previously. The ultimate reason for such series of crimes is to dissuade the countries from forming allies with the United States.
“The United states bombed Hadith dam and continue to strike the Muslims of Iraq. Forming allies with America which will only alleviate destruction” claims the ISIS executioner, who manifests the destruction. Eventually these series of events only provokes the questions of security to human life.
The grudge between the United States of America and the rebel groups, is surprisingly not new, but marked its profound origin since the Twin tower attack dated September 2001. Since then the enmity has been brewing up. The cascade of recent events has made the ingression of the U.S military into the scene. President Obama has mentioned in his speech that the United States would endorse Britain and hunt down the terrorists irrespective of their location.
It is confounding that the victims are those who were nonetheless associated with any dreadful activities. The repercussion of all such riots affects the common man. All the three victims were extraneous of any chaotic affairs. Mike Haines, David Haine’s brother states, “He helped whoever needed help, regardless of race, creed or religion and was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles.” It is comprehensively unjust to execute someone who has spent more time in philanthropy and in helping others. This cloud of happenings triggers some cardinal questions which lurks my mind. If this condition prevails, then, tomorrow it could either be me or you or someone else whose life would be at risk, simply a “Tit for Tat” risking the life of the civilians.
The ISIS’s rampaging behaviour of massacring the common mass is an act of cowardise. On the contrary, the ISIS is not righteous enough to preclude Britain from forming allies as it has been exorting its own troops into Islamism. It is uncertainly obvious, that the people and troops of Iraq are being urged into the fiasco at a greater extent.
Besides, the ISIS has captured parts of Iraq, which has contributed to the ancillary reasons for the  conflict of ISIS with Peshmerga troops over the Kurdish region of Iraq. The main reason for the battle, was to reclaim their area seized by ISIS.
The ISIS has disclosed another video, in response to President Obama’s confronting speech, which was more like a trailer of a Blockbuster movie with a perfect caption, “Flames of War — fighting has just begun…Coming soon”. Such portents of combat leads to an augmenting hostility among the nations at an alarming pace. Ironically, it is more like involving in a sport which causes damage to the spectators in case of injuries.
However, the reinforcing words of President Obama alleviates the level of anxiety. The fact that United States would form coalition with other nations substantially reflects the element of tenacity. Paradoxically, it may furthermore add to the risks of devastation to the economical and human sources during the course of feud. It is befitting to venture the fight than the cold war which would explode sometime due to the exponential pressure.
