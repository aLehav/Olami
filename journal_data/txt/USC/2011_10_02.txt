After USC’s victory against Arizona, junior quarterback Matt Barkley’s record-breaking 468 passing yards (surpassed Carson Palmer’s previous best of 448 passing yards) and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods’ career high (255 receiving yards) days were well-chronicled.
But just as essential, if not more so, to the Trojans’ win was the play of freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee.
Lee notched eight receptions for 144 yards and a touchdown, and came up short of a second score on his 45-yard grab in the fourth quarter.
Lee now has 21 receptions, 323 receiving yards and three touchdowns on the year. USC coach Lane Kiffin has spoke glowingly of the former Junipero Serra High School standout.
“It was great to see Marqise take the step of a true freshman to the next level.” Kiffin said. “[He] actually came up and had X-rays and missed a series … Then he came back and put himself in even though they were questioning whether he could play. It says a lot about him as a true freshman.”
As Lee continues to improve and become the No. 2 option on an offense looking for more consistency outside of Woods, the Trojan offense figures to become even more potent in the long run.
Woods, Lee’s former teammate of at Serra, noted his performance through five games so far.
“Marqise is a great player,” Woods said. “His play is excellent through five games. I look forward to him getting better and keep putting up numbers for this offense.”
Despite the offensive explosion, the biggest plays for the Trojans might have come on the other side of the ball.
USC’s defense intercepted Arizona quarterback Nick Foles twice in the first quarter. Coming into the game, however, Foles had completed 210 passes in a row without being intercepted.
He had also tossed 10 touchdown passes without throwing an interception against top-ranked teams in Oklahoma State, Stanford and Oregon.
Though Foles committed two early turnovers, he still managed to throw for 425 yards and four touchdowns.
—
Coming into their matchup with the Wildcats, the Trojans had only forced three turnovers (one interception by redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris and two forced fumbles). Junior safety T.J. McDonald was the recipient of both of Foles’ interceptions and acknowledged his plays changed the momentum of the game.
“I knew he didn’t have any picks coming into this game so I knew it was going to be a challenge for us not only to stop the passing attack, but to get some turnovers,” McDonald said postgame. “It pumped up the whole team and the offense was able to put some points on the board.”
Despite the win, McDonald said he knows the defense needs to show some improvement if USC expects to win its next few games.
“Today, our offense did a great job and picked us up,” McDonald said. “We definitely want to play better, but we’ll go into the film room, make sure we fix our [mistakes]. We got two weeks before our next game, but we’ll come out two weeks from now and we’ll be ready to go.”
Good win USC.  Also, good luck with the rest of the season and a special request to give Colorado a hearty welcome to the Pac-12.  It would appear that CU bit off more than it can chew when it felt that being in the Big 12 was lame and that they deserved a seat at the table in the Pac-10.  So, please oblige them with a nice butt kicking.  Believe me, with all the hubris that’s come out of Boulder about what great athletics it has, it’s about time they got a heavy dose of reality in terms of what good athletics looks like.  So, good hunting and bring home a buffalo skin.

The USC women’s soccer team endured another frustrating weekend at McAlister Field, losing 2-1 to Oregon on Sunday and 1-0 in overtime to No. 19 Oregon State on Friday. Its most recent loss to the Ducks marked the team’s six straight defeat — all coming by one-goal margins.
“There’s not a lot to say right now,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said after Sunday’s defeat. “It’s a difficult moment to be in. Life is going to throw a lot of challenges at you, and this is one of them.”
The Women of Troy (3-9, 0-3) had their chances against the Ducks on Sunday, outshooting Oregon 14 to 9 and getting off eight corner kicks to Oregon’s two. Trailing 1-0, USC got its lone goal courtesy of junior defender Kristina Noriega, who capitalized on one of the corner kicks with a header that knotted the game up in the 57th minute.
“It’s really frustrating,” Noriega said. “We just come out here and beat ourselves. We gave up some stupid goals on mistakes. I really feel like we should have won.”
The tie was short-lived, as Oregon struck back quickly with a goal of its own in the 62nd minute. Midfielder Shanelle Simien found fellow freshman, forward Bri Pugh, on the left side of USC’s goal, and Pugh put it just past sophomore goalkeeper Shelby Church from six yards out for what proved to be the game-winning score.
“We have to learn how to stop making mistakes in the most crucial moments,” Khosroshahin said. “I thought we took care of the ball pretty well and got some good looks at the goal. We just didn’t do well with the looks we got, and they did. I can’t take anything away from Oregon.”
The last 28 minutes of the match were played at a frantic pace, as USC put several shots on goal that never found the back of the net. Shortly after Oregon seized the lead, the Women of Troy nearly turned another corner kick into a goal, but sophomore forward/midfielder Elizabeth Eddy’s header sailed just over the top post.
“It’s tough because we’ve pretty much gone through every type of scenario in practice and in games,” Eddy said. “It’s a bummer, but if we keep working at it we should be alright.”
Eddy insisted that despite all of the tough losses, the team remains upbeat.
“Coach told us to keep our heads up and I think we’re doing that,” she said. “It takes a lot of maturity to go through what we’re going through, but I think we’ll be fine. It’s definitely a learning experience.”
Though the Oregon defeat stung, Friday’s loss was perhaps the most difficult defeat of the 2011 season. The Women of Troy played Oregon State to a 0-0 tie through 94 minutes of play before sophomore forward Jenna Richardson scored the game-winner for the Beavers.
USC will travel north and continue Pac-12 play next weekend against Stanford and California.
“We have to fight on,” Khosroshahin said. “That’s what we’re all about. We’re going to keep kicking it and hopefully we’ll get some better luck.”
Tough Times don’t last, But TOUGH TROJANS TEAMS DO!  Sports is a microcosm of Life.
We all go through Ups & Downs. I have watched many of these disappointing losses. We have played well
for most of the match in most of these games.  Then suddenly the opposing gets a break, or our defense breaks down, and voila……we fall behind. We keep outplaying teams in all aspects of the game, except for the scoreboard.
Coach Ali is not only a great Coach who won a national championship in his 1st yr. at USC, but he is personable, classy, cool, and a super human being. 
The players are talented, focused, and team oriented.   We must all hang tough and play through this losing streak.  Remember, we OUTPLAYED the #4 team in the country [Ok. state] a few weeks ago yet lost.
Our Women Soccer Team can play with any team in the USA.  Keep the Faith, Believe in Redemption,
and lets start a winning streak this weekend in NoCal.
Keep Fighting ON & On!!!
Tommy Trojanelli

Three members of the USC women’s tennis team’s highly touted freshman class, Gabriella DeSimone, Zoe Scandalis and Sabrina Santamaria, took to the court for the first time in their collegiate careers over the weekend in the pre-qualifiers for the Riviera All-American Championships in Westwood, Calif.
Strong start · Senior Alison Ramos began the year advancing to the semifinals of the Cal Nike Invitational in Berkley, Calif. over the weekend. - Daily Trojan file photo
Only Scandalis, however, qualified for the qualifying round and main draw, which is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
Scandalis first knocked out Georgia sophomore Kate Fuller 4-6, 6-3, 6-1, then made quick work of Memphis’ Maria Slupska 6-4, 6-2. In the round of 16, Scandalis rallied to defeat Virginia’s Li Xi, earning a trip to the qualifiers.
DeSimone drew a tough opponent in Duke’s Ester Goldfield. Goldfeld, the No. 2 player in her class according to TennisRecruiting.net, who defeated DeSimone in straight sets, 6-2, 6-4.
Santamaria defeated NC State’s Joelle Kissell, who boasted a record of 20-5 in singles play during the 2011 spring season, 6-2, 6-2 in her opening match. Santamaria went on to beat William and Mary’s Kayla Rizzolo 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 before falling to Nebraska’s Mary Weatherholt in the round of 16.
Meanwhile, senior Alison Ramos served as the lone representative for the USC women’s tennis team at the Cal Nike Invitational in Berkeley, Calif., playing in both the singles and doubles brackets.
Ramos fell in straight sets (6-1, 7-5) to No. 8 Clarisse Baca in singles play but recovered in the consolation bracket. She defeated Saint Mary’s senior Anna Chkhikvishvili 6-4, 6-2, beat Santa Clara junior Alex Zaniewski 6-3, 7-6 (5) in the quarterfinals, and advanced onwards to face off against Pacific’s Iveta Masarova in the semifinals (results are pending).
In doubles action, Ramos teamed up with Arizona State’s Joanna Smith. The duo reached the second round before bowing out to Baca and fellow Sacramento State teammate Maria Meliuk. Ramos’ usual partner, USC Valeria Pulido, did not participate because she will soon be playing in the Pan American Games in Guadalajara. When Pulido comes back to USC in November, she and Ramos will be reunited as the No. 28 doubles team in the country.
After the upcoming qualifiers and main draw, the Women of Troy  will then travel to San Diego for the ITA Southwest Regional Championships.

Three members from the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team will travel to the Midwest, looking to showcase their abilities in singles play.
Senior Daniel Nguyen and sophomore Ray Sarmiento, ranked No. 16 and No. 15, respectively, and freshman Yannick Hanfmann will represent the cardinal and gold at the ITA Men’s All-American Championship in Tulsa, Okla.
Challenge · Senior Daniel Nguyen will face some of the top players in the nation this week in the ITA Men’s All-American Championship. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Nguyen and Sarmiento will compete in the singles main draw starting Thursday, while Hanfmann needs to win three consecutive matches in the singles qualifying draw from today through Wednesday to join his teammates in the quest for a singles title. USC will not have any players participate in the doubles draw.
The three players enter the first ITA event of the year after efforts at the Harvard Fall Chowder Fest in Cambridge, Mass., last week. Sarmiento and Hanfmann were both undefeated at the tournament, posting 3-0 records. Nguyen went 2-1 with a loss to No. 8 Evan King of Michigan, who will also be in the singles draw in Tulsa.
To play in tournaments such as the Fall Chowder Fest and the All-Americans gives the players a chance to hone their games before beginning the season in January.
“The fall is for trying different strategies and pushing the guys to play in a certain way,” USC coach Peter Smith said. “We’re just trying to get [the players] to grow so they can be their best [in the NCAA championships] in May.”
Most of the top players in the current ITA singles rankings will participate in the singles main draw, including Ohio State’s No. 2 Blaž Rola, Kentucky’s No. 3 Eric Quigley and Duke’s No. 4 Henrique Cunha. Last year’s champion sophomore No. 1 Alex Domijan will not participate because of an injury.
Despite the tough competition awaiting them, the players look forward to the chance at reaching the top of the singles ladder. It will take six consecutive wins in the main draw to earn the singles title.
“Winning it would be great, but we got to take it one match at a time,” Nguyen said.
Wins at the renowned competition, featuring more than 300 players vying for a national title, could spark an early season confidence boost for the players.
“A tournament like the All-Americans is all about having big wins and getting confident,” Smith said. “It can do a lot for a player’s season.”
Sarmiento and Hanfmann have never competed in the All-American Championship in previous years, but Nguyen enters the competition for the third year in a row, looking for a repeat performance. Last year Nguyen was the only Trojan to make it out of the first round.
“I have to prepare myself for two matches in the first day,” Nguyen said. “I remember last year I was beat up by the second matchup. I’m definitely going to use some prior experience in my last tournament [in Tulsa].”

The No. 1 USC men’s water polo team is human after all.
Facing No. 4 Stanford in the semifinal round Sunday morning, the Trojans had their 22-game win streak snapped as the Cardinal won 6-4.
USC faced No. 4 Stanford in the semifinal round on Sunday after the Cardinal eked out a 7-6 win over No. 5 Pepperdine in its quarterfinal match. In a rematch of the NorCal Tournament semifinals in which the Trojans bested the Cardinal 12-5, the Cardinal exacted some revenge.
Not enough · Freshman driver Kostas Genidounias notched two goals against Stanford, but USC fell 6-4 as it suffered its first loss this season. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
After clinging onto a 3-2 lead heading into halftime, the Trojans came out cold in the second half, only managing one goal score in the half from senior driver Peter Kurzeka. Freshman driver Kostas Genidounias notched two goals in the second period and sophomore driver Nikola Vavic contributed the other goal. On the defensive front, senior goalie Joel Dennerley’s 12 saves were not enough to stop the Cardinal offense, especially in a second half in which the Cardinal scored four goals.
The Trojans had advanced to the semifinal round after decisive victories over Pomona-Pitzer and UC Irvine on Saturday.
On Saturday morning, the Trojans began their match against No. 20 Pomona-Pitzer by rattling off 15 consecutive goals, as they rolled to a 21-1 win. In the victory, two young Trojans notched the first goals of their collegiate careers: freshman driver Marc Vonderweidt (three fourth-quarter goals) and redshirt freshman two-meter A.J. MacDonell. Redshirt freshman utility Ivan Kustic led all scorers with four goals. In goal, the Trojans received strong play from redshirt freshman goalie Ely Bonilla, who played the duration of the match and registered six saves.
In the afternoon match against No. 7 UC Irvine, USC broke out to a 7-1 lead by halftime on the strength of two goals from Genidounias, who would later add a third in the third quarter. All told, eight different Trojans found the back of the net in this match. Dennerley played the first three quarters, stopping five of the eight shots he faced, before giving way to Bonilla in the fourth quarter.
After falling to Stanford, USC faced UCLA at 4:30 p.m. Sunday in the third-place game.

The streak has reached six.
Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter led the No. 5 USC women’s volleyball team in sweeps against Pac-12 foes Colorado (25-21, 25-21, 25-18) and Utah (25-13, 25-14, 25-19) over the weekend, pushing the squad’s win streak to a season-high six matches. All have come in the aftermath of USC’s straight-set loss to UCLA at home Sept. 9.
“We’ve handled things pretty well this weekend,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “It’s good when you can beat teams like [we did] at their own place.”
Stat stuffer · Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter recorded 29 kills and 18 digs over the weekend in leading USC to sweeps over Colorado and Utah. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Jupiter led the Women of Troy (11-3, 6-1) in kills in both victories with 14 against the Buffaloes (5-10, 0-7) and 15 against the Utes (6-10, 1-5), but she was far from the only USC player to stuff the stat sheet over the weekend.
Junior outside hitter Katie Fuller recorded a double-double against the Utes with 12 kills and 13 digs, and Lauren Williams chipped in 10 kills while hitting .529.
“The great thing about our team is that we have interchangeable parts,” Fuller said. “Everyone on the bench can come in and contribute.”
USC hit an efficient .400 (45-9-90) as a team in its road contest at Utah, holding its opponents to a .100 (29-19-100) hitting percentage.
“Our first ball kill was extremely good,” Haley said. “[Utah] couldn’t defend worth anything against that.”
Haley credited Jupiter for setting the tone in the first set, when five of her kills accounted for the team’s first 17 points.
USC strung together run after run against the Utes, who never managed to score more than two points in a row.
“We were pretty good in every area,” Haley said. “That let us get more opportunities for other kids to play, which is important.”
The Women of Troy weren’t quite as offensively dominant on Friday night at Colorado, but the defense picked up enough of the slack to pick up the road win.
Senior setter Kendall Bateman and sophomore outside hitter Sara Shaw both set career-highs with 12 digs, while freshman middle blocker Hannah Schraer added a career-high 11 kills.
Schraer posted a kill to break a 14-14 tie in the first set, sparking the Women of Troy to a 9-3 run that enabled them to close out the opening set.
Down 18-24 in the second set, Colorado scored three points in a row before Bateman set up Schraer for another crucial termination.
The Women of Troy staked out a 6-1 lead in the final set that the Buffaloes would never get within three points of, as USC clinched the victory.
“[Schraer] is a great, great freshman,” Haley said. “She keeps performing, she keeps learning, and she works hard… She’s just doing a great job.”
Schraer has been a fixture in the starting lineup all season, but could lose some playing time in the coming weeks due to the return of sophomore Alexis Olgard, who was back on the court this weekend for the first time this season after undergoing offseason knee surgery.
“We’re just starting to get healthy,” Haley said. “You’re going to start seeing competitions for positions again.”
Schraer and Olgard will battle it out with senior Lauren Williams for the two starting spots in the middle, but don’t expect there to be any animosity between the trio.
“It’ll just be a healthy competition,” Schraer said. “We’re always competing in practice, so it will help our team get stronger in so many different ways.”
The Women of Troy take another road trip next weekend as they will look to extend their streak of six sweeps in a row against the Arizona schools.
They play Arizona on Friday at 7 p.m. in Tucson, Ariz., before traveling to nearby Tempe, Ariz., to face Arizona State on Saturday for another 7 p.m. match.

When it comes to a battle of perception, USC coach Lane Kiffin is probably going to lose. And he’s probably going to lose about 11 out of 10 times.
It comes with the territory of being Lane Kiffin, in large part.
Most USC fans have never exactly instilled a ton of faith in the Trojans’ second-year coach. He’s a good playcaller and a sharp recruiter — at the very best. Or so it goes.
It was open season on Kiffin following the Trojans’ 43-22 loss at the hands of Arizona State last week in Tempe, Ariz. Though it was only September of his second season with USC, the speculation as to his future with the program began. The criticisms snowballed. A FireLaneKiffin.com hit the interwebs.
But nobody has flinched. Kiffin is accustomed to the scrutiny. It came when he served as USC’s co-offensive coordinator in 2005 and 2006. It came when he worked for Al Davis in Oakland. It came when he coached in the Southeastern Conference.
And five games into his second season at USC — his “dream job” — he is being scrutinized more intently, more frequently than at any point before.
It’s a fight he just can’t win.
Reporters have grumbled about his post-game spin. Cardinal-and-gold backers have moaned about a perceived indifference. Opposing fans have, well, jeered.
“Obviously [we’re] very pleased to get the win, to get to 4-1,” Kiffin said Saturday. “The most important thing all week was to rebound from our first loss of the season and get to 4-1 going into the bye week.”
Few, however, conceded Kiffin’s remarks about the Trojans’ overall record thus far.
Last weekend none of USC’s wins in 2011 appeared particularly impressive. Minnesota, which lost to USC 19-17 in its season opener, fell to Michigan 58-0. Utah, which many considered to be the team’s quality win of the season, lost 31-14 at home to Washington. And Syracuse was upended by Rutgers 19-16 in double overtime.
Add to the fact Arizona is now 1-4, USC’s strength of schedule doesn’t appear all that strong.
For a Kiffin-coached team that has won 80 percent of its games nearly halfway through the season, optimism is not exactly oozing out of the USC program most have come to define as mediocre and average at this point in the season.
Despite a record-setting display from junior quarterback Matt Barkley, who threw for 468 yards, eclipsing Carson Palmer’s single-game mark, most of the talk centered on USC defensive inabilities.
“It’s definitely an honor and it feels great,” Barkley said of his performance. “But at the same time, it doesn’t even feel like it at all because it was such a tight game and it was going back and forth.”
USC gave up 41 points against the Wildcats, one week after similarly surrendering 43 at Arizona State. Against the Sun Devils, the Trojans were burned by big plays. On just the fourth play from scrimmage, junior running back Cameron Marshall scored on a 70-yard touchdown run. Even senior linebacker Shelly Lyons later scored on a 41-yard interception return.
When hosting Arizona, USC prevented the big play, not allowing a gain of more than 27 yards. But consequently, it conceded short completions en route to giving up 37 first downs, a school record, along with 554 yards of total offense.
Against Arizona State, it also lost the turnover battle, finishing minus-four. Against Arizona, it finished plus-one. Seemingly, it was inconsequential, as the Trojans won by just a seven-point margin.
Under normal circumstances, USC would be two wins away from being bowl eligible. It would be a half-game removed from first place in the Pac-12 South with a chance to play in the inaugural conference title game. Instead, it’s fighting to remain relevant and Kiffin is fighting the perception that the program has hit the metaphorical iceberg.
His attempts, however, have been largely fruitless.
On a day where there were plenty of positives, Barkley’s record-breaking numbers, junior safety T.J. McDonald’s two interceptions and a combined 399 receiving yards from sophomore Robert Woods and freshman Marqise Lee, a school record, a few glaring pimples stood out.
A defense that looked confused once again, a bizarre decision to go for it on fourth-and-one with a 14-point lead late in the fourth quarter.
Kiffin wants you to believe USC is close. He’ll talk ad-nauseam about Barkley and Woods, about Lee and about a young team that is still growing.
But fans are naturally impatient. They’re accustomed to winning and winning handily. This is USC, after all.
You can cite record-breaking performances and feel-good stories. Neither, however, allows Kiffin to captivate a fanbase that has become increasingly frustrated.
Some things are too tough to ignore. USC has given up 40 points in back-to-back games for the first time in school history and that’s an awfully tough thing to spin.

Yes, the deck is stacked against Kiffin and he handles it well. I agree with you that USC fans expect to win, but there have been plenty of periods when that hasn’t happened. We have had long losing streaks against Notre Dame and UCLA.
The media complained first that Kiffin is too negative and then he is too positive. After the first game, the media said that USC didn’t adjust the play calling. That was absolutely false as there were more receivers catching passes and there were more running plays. Problem wasn’t the play calling, it was the execution by mostly inexperienced athletes.  It doesn’t matter what Kiffin says: it will be spun by the press to make it controversial.
No question the defense has been struggling the past two games and the “prevent” type of defense doesn’t contain anything, only slow down the inevitable. Both Kiffins need to implement some changes to address the spread better.
However, keep in mind that Foles passed for 398 yards against top 10 teams Oregon and Oklahoma State so USC is not the only team that could not stop him.
The USC offense has shown that it is very difficult to stop when it isn’t making mistakes.
This is a young team and it will get better as the season progresses, and a lot better next year especially if some juniors are smart enough to return.
Monte Kiffins freaking old and needs to retire. His defense is outdated and and it doesn’t work against the spread. After so many yrs of running bascially the same defense under Pete teams know how to attack it. What we need is a young defensive coordinator from the college ranks, not an NFL DC that faces nothing but pro teams but a college DC that knows how to defend against the spread that simple. How about the DC from Boise?

Matt Barkley saw a lot of Carson Palmer when the Heisman Trophy winner played for USC in the early 2000s. Growing up in nearby Newport Beach, Barkley, now a junior quarterback for the Trojans, remembers Palmer’s 2002 season, the year he won the award while throwing for 3,942 yards and 33 touchdowns.
Record breaking · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley threw for 468 passing yards Saturday aternoon against Arizona in USC’s 48-41 victory, besting Carson Palmer’s nine-year record of 448 passing yards. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
On Saturday, in front of a crowd of 63,707 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Barkley shattered the former Trojan signal caller’s single-game record for passing yards with 468 of his own. Along with four touchdown passes, Barkley’s record-setting display helped lead USC (4-1, 2-1) to a narrow 48-41 victory over Arizona just one week after the team’s first loss of the season at Arizona State.
“It’s crazy because I remember looking up to Carson Palmer and he’s one of my heroes,” Barkley said. “I did want to be in his shoes.”
The offensive outburst, the most points USC has scored in a game this season, was needed to stave off a Wildcats team (1-4, 0-3) that also moved the ball successfully, scoring four second-half touchdowns. Behind its own seasoned signal caller in senior Nick Foles, who completed 41-of-53 pass attempts, Arizona outscored USC 29-21 in the final two quarters.
“That’s a great team with some great receivers,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said of the Wildcats.
For the second week in a row, USC’s defense surrendered more than 40 points, allowing 554 yards of total offense before nearly relinquishing a late two-touchdown lead. The Trojans also allowed Arizona to convert 37 first downs, the most in school history.

“They went down the field a bit too easy in the second half,” Kiffin said. “We just need a full defensive game.”
Leading 48-34 with less than two minutes remaining in the game, USC opted to try and convert a fourth-and-one play from its 47-yard line, but Barkley’s pass to senior wide receivers Brandon Carswell was incomplete, giving the Wildcats, who scored six plays later on a four-yard touchdown pass from Foles to freshman wide receiver Austin Hills, a shorter field.
“You have the opportunity to put the game away,” Kiffin said of the decision not to punt. “We’re going to believe in our players.”
But in the first half, the Trojans defense, which had forced just three interceptions all season, looked slightly different, as evidenced by its two interceptions of Foles, who had a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 10:0 prior to Saturday’s game.
With 7:19 remaining in the first quarter, junior safety T.J. McDonald intercepted Foles when a pass sailed over the middle of the field.
Minutes later, on the next Arizona drive after a 46-yard field goal from freshman kicker Andre Heidari gave USC a 10-0 lead, Foles was picked off by McDonald again.
“To get them early changed the momentum of the game,” McDonald said. “It pumped up the team and they were able to go put points on the board.”

Three plays later, Barkley connected with freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee on a 38-yard touchdown pass, ballooning USC’s lead to 17. The Trojans would go on to score again in the second half on another Barkley pass, his third of the game.
“They just sat back and gave us a lot of routes,” Barkley said. “And across the board, I had protection.”
The defense also limited Arizona to just two scores in the first half despite 227 yards of total offense.
“I was just happy with the turnovers,” Kiffin said. “It was good to see.”
But the offense, which finished just 18 yards shy of 600 total yards, outshined whatever noteworthy plays the defense made.
In addition to Barkley’s performance, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods finished with 14 receptions for 255 yards and two touchdowns. Similarly, his high school teammate, freshman wideout Marqise Lee totaled 144 receiving yards and one touchdown on eight catches.

“[Barkley’s] putting the ball on the money, on point every time,” Woods said. “He’s making it really easy on us because he puts it right where it needs to be.”
Equally, Woods and Lee have made it easy on Barkley. Of his 32 completions, 22 went to Woods and Lee.
“I’ve played with him since high school, and it’s exciting to see him grow,” Woods said of Lee. “I’m real proud of him.”
Despite a young offensive line that looked particularly young a week ago in the Trojans’ 43-22 loss to Arizona State, Barkley was not sacked once against the Wildcats.
“Our line was a huge component because of the protection,” Barkley said of the unit, which on average is allowing less than one sack per game. “I didn’t get touched once, except when I rolled out of the pocket. They were huge.”

With the Trojans heading into a bye week before an Oct. 13 contest against California at AT&T Park in San Francisco, most players appear content with the win — at least for now.
“In a sense, it is what it is,” freshman linebacker Dion Bailey said in the moments following the game. “We’ll take our wins.”

USC Facilities Management Services began an initiative at the start of this year to increase recycling during home football games this season but so far has found fans and tailgaters are not using the system.
Big blue bins · Facilities Management Services has placed two recycling bins along West 37th Place on game days to encourage fans to recycle bottles and cans. - Kristy Pyke | Daily Trojan
Big blue recycling bins were rolled out to help encourage people to sort out their own trash, said  Daniel Benitez, FMS landscape supervisor.
“We are trying to get people to think about recycling,” Benitez said. “We weren’t getting too [many] results with the cardboard trash cans. It is a process to get people to notice. People just throw their trash where they are standing.”
Linda Chapital, communications manager for FMS, said USC collects on average eight to 10 tons of trash each game but currently has very little success with recycling in particular.
“For the amount of people we have here, we aren’t getting that much in the recycle bins,” Chapital said.
Chapital also said the lack of recycling is partly because members in the community gather most of the recyclables before the trash can reach recycling bins.
Halli Bovia, USC sustainability program manager, said students should take more individual responsibility for their actions.
“There needs to be more of an emphasis on personal responsibility for your personal waste rather than relying on community members to pick up trash,” Bovia said.
Charlotte Mountain, a junior majoring in psychology, said she attempts to recycle at tailgates, but recycling bins are not always readily available.
“I try to recycle, but there aren’t that many recycling bins,” Mountain said. “If there were more recycling bins, I would love to recycle.”
Students agreed they needed to take more initiative and said the university needs to make recycling more readily available on campus, especially at tailgates.
“The university can make it easier by providing more means for students to recycle, but also, students have to take up the responsibility themselves to recycle,” said Richelle Tanner, a freshman majoring in environmental studies and jazz studies.
The Undergraduate Student Government created a new sustainability position to increase student awareness of sustainable practices this year.
“There is now going to be a much larger emphasis on sustainability initiatives and projects around campus,” said Rohan Mehra, USG assistant director of sustainability. “We have about eight projects in the works right now and are meeting with USC Hospitality, the Lyon Center, Transportation and other groups on campus to complete them.”
There are two recycling bins currently in use on game days, one located on the corner of West 35th Place and Trousdale Parkway and the other on West 35th Place and McCarthy Quad, but FMS plans to increase its game day recycling efforts in the future.
“There are just two containers right now but we are looking to try different things,” Benitez said. “[The] Sustainability program has been here for awhile already. Now we are trying to get different trends to go green.”
Kristen Rodgers, a sophomore majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said recycling at tailgates is a simple task and has a positive environmental impact.
“It is a waste to simply throw away all of those bottles and cans when you could just as easily recycle and create less of a carbon footprint,” Rodgers said.
Do we really want the local trash scavengers going through everything on campus. Apparently we don’t mind, because I have seen several times where a local is going through the trash, with a DPS officer simply ignoring it.
Looks real classy for the University having these locals roam the campus with their trash bags collecting.
Isn’t there a better way to help the locals than allowing them free reign of campus for this activity?
So you want to “go green” and “create less of a carbon footprint” by recycling? Well where do you think these locals are taking our cans then? What is the difference who recycles them? If they wanna collect our CRV and help the environment what’s the problem? This initiative is completely pointless…
It is mentioned in this article briefly, but the reality is, the second you throw anything recyclable into a bin or can. it is plucked out by people on campus to make money this way.  I applaud their efforts and sense of industry.    As long as these groups are on campus, your bins will remain empty.  It seems to me you are spending a lot of time on a problem that does not exist.

Though USC is a private institution, transfer students with Cal Grants will be affected if the second part of California’s DREAM Act is passed.
Gov. Jerry Brown signed the first part of the act, AB 130, in late July, allowing undocumented students who qualify for in-state tuition to receive scholarships from non-state funds. If he signs AB 131, the second part of the act, the legislation will specifically grant undocumented students the opportunity to receive aid from the state, such as Cal Grants.
USC could be affected through those transfer students from California state schools with Cal Grants because the Cal Grants would be applicable at USC.
In 2010, 72 percent of transfer students at USC came from a University of California, California State University or California community college school, according to the university.
“You can take a Cal Grant anywhere — that’s an open issue that we need to work out with the [California] Student Aid Commission that would address all of these issues,” said Veronica Villalobos-Cruz, USC executive director of state government relations. “They would need to create a whole separate application for these students since they cannot fill out the FAFSA, so they have to find a whole new financial process to figure out the financial needs of this story and the appropriate criteria.”
Villalobos-Cruz said USC is taking a neutral stance toward the potential signing of the second half of the California DREAM Act this week, as the bill applies to funding from state institutions and does not directly affect private schools.
A specific system would have to be put in place to appropriately address transfer students’ specific financial situations, Villalobos-Cruz said.
AB 540 alters the law so undocumented students can receive Cal Grants if they meet  specific requirements. They must attend a California high school for three or more academic years, graduate from a California high school or attain a GED and attend an accredited  public college in the state.
“It’s targeted toward AB 540 students and it only defines the public universities, and in-state and out-of-state tuition,” Villalobos-Cruz said.
According to the website for the 2012 Common Application, which USC began using this year, college applicants must indicate their status as a U.S. or non-U.S. citizen, but providing a Social Security number is “required for U.S. citizens and Permanent Residents applying for financial aid via FAFSA.”
Undocumented students could be attending USC, but they would not be able to officially apply for federal aid without providing a social security number.
“These undocumented students are eligible for merit awards, so they’re getting outside sources of help,” said Tom McWhorter, executive director of USC financial aid. “It’s not that we don’t have undocumented students, but they don’t have a social security number, so they can’t fill out a FAFSA. That’s why they’re so limited.”
Though the DREAM Act might not affect USC directly, Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, pointed out that the DREAM Act raises compelling arguments.
“The philosophical argument is whether you should provide services and support for someone who’s not in the country legally, or whether that person should be penalized,” Schnur said. “But the practical argument is even more stark. These young people graduated from high school. Do you want to invest further in order to increase the chances that they become productive taxpayers, as opposed to recipients of social services?”
Labor demographics also come into play, according to Dowell Myers, director of the Population Dynamics Research Group and a demography and urban planning professor at the USC School of Policy, Planning and Development. The aging baby boomer generation will leave behind many spots that need to be filled by qualified, college-educated candidates.
“The DREAM Act has the potential to increase the number of students going to college — that’s a good thing,” Myers said. “I know that because the economy is evolving; they need more workers that have a college degree, and the way we’re going now, we’re going to have a shortage of a million workers in California in the next 10 to 20 years. So we really need a lot more people going to college.”
 
Correction: The following quotation was originally attributed to Tom McWhorter, executive director of USC financial aid. The quote is actually from Veronica Villalobos-Cruz, USC executive director of state government relations.
“You can take a Cal Grant anywhere — that’s an open issue that we need to work out with the [California] Student Aid Commission that would address all of these issues. They would need to create a whole separate application for these students since they cannot fill out the FAFSA, so they have to find a whole new financial process to figure out the financial needs of this story and the appropriate criteria”
Using the old “talking about Legal and Illegal is Racist” argument has never held very much water in a logical discussion. It is always used to put shame and guilt on the other party, trying to make them defensive. If US Citizens were truly racist and xenophobic, we wouldn’t have Legal Immigration and Foreign Nationals having lucrative jobs in our country. If we were truly Racist, we wouldn’t have 11 million Illegal Aliens in our country. If time was taken to actually read AB 131, by its title and contents, identifies this group as: ILLEGAL ALIEN STUDENTS (Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors and at: http://www.aroundthecapitol.com/Bills/AB_131/20112012/). Using this old rhetoric is itself Racist, “White and American People” hating, and only shows desperation by lack of cohesive reasoning.
The same can be said with the old rhetoric of “Only the Native Americans belong here. Whites have abused them and their lands.” Native Americans were themselves immigrants by coming over the land bridge from Alaska and the Aleutians.
I wonder why, if the United States is so inhospitable and cruel, is it that people aren’t just fleeing here. Why do people clamor to come here, by facing a life-threatening excursion, face separation from family, paying and being at the subjugation of dangerous criminals, etc.
Y’all like to talk about “illegals”, criminal opportunists taking our jobs and our tax dollars and don’t deserve human rights. Y’all think undocumented students broke the law. What, when they were 12 years old? 6 years? 6 days old? They largely had no say in their citizenship status, but they grew up in the U.S., they graduated high school, and they have dreams of going to college, just like all of you. But many of them can’t go to college, because they don’t have access to scholarships and grants like you do, or their states pass laws that don’t allow them to go to college.
I’m first generation American. My family has only been in this country 40+ years. We’re immigrants. Y’all are all immigrants. This “immigration debate” is really some classist/racist witch trial establishing who is an American (immigrants who have been here longer), and who isn’t. And if you’re not an American, then “real” Americans have all the right to oppress you until you are deported or until you leave. If you subscribe to white nationalist thinking, then you support the oppression of undocumented residents and don’t care at all about human rights. Education is a human right, living is a human right. You cannot hide behind your false “legal or illegal” argument. The only difference between an undocumented American and you is a social security number, and you stand in the way of their citizenship and education because you want to continue to stand on top of them.
If you care at all for justice, support the CA Dream Act, and support the DREAM Act as a path to citizenship.
American Dream is not free handouts.
Just because they were brought here as minors doesn’t mean we should be forced (through taxation) to provide them with financial means to attend college. We’re already forced (yep, through taxation) to provide them with K-12 education. Isn’t confiscating my money for the benefit of illegal aliens a way of oppressing me, of depriving me?
Race, class, and immigration has always been an issue with the US and intolerant people.
@DH:  Yes, we DO need a federal DREAM Act  and general immigration reform (we also need responsible, sane adults in congress do accomplish such a historical feat)!  I’m not going to simply state “life isn’t fair” in addressing those students that have been “left out.”  There are, after all, plenty of students at great universities like USC that leave you wondering, “HOW did you get into this school?  How much did daddy pay for your spot?”  And I have met undocumented students that just work their butts off and deserve a spot more than anyone I’ve ever met!
“Illegal” status must be taken into serious consideration.  By this I mean that we need to realize that there truly is not much of a difference between an undocumented student that’s been here most of their lives and someone who is born in the U.S.  Both grew up American and know little else.  Any one of us could have been born out of the country had our parents been traveling or what-have-you.
@Rich:  So in response to USA first….many of these undocumented students are as “American” as you and I.  Not to mention that, if these graduates were to attain a taxpaying job, they would not be sending their money abroad like many international students.  USA first applies to this select batch of students who want to better their lives, better their communities, and better their home country.
Once again, this is a complicated issue, there’s no easy answer.  But we MUST look at this through all angles and consider all options that will not harm anyone who’s trying to achieve “legality.”
I don’t understand why the same misunderstood issues come up with AB 131.  The philosophical question that should be asked is “Why should we invest further into an Illegal Student population when they cannot be employed legally, cannot attain a quick path to citizenship with A Federal DREAM Act not likely in the near future?”  They would still have to work at menial jobs with their low contribution, if any when “under the table”, to our tax revenues. The erroneous other issue is that we will have a shortfall in filling job vacancies in 10 to 20 years.  This is such an absurd projection that has no factual basis for its projection. 
 AB 131 creates more problems in this regard, more frustration.  What is needed is true immigration reform, as opposed to another blanket amnesty.  There are plenty of US Citizens and Legal Immigrants who have been placed out and priced out by increasing fees and tuition, while not being eligible or having lost their financial aid, and by recruitment of Foreign Students and out-of-state students who pay nearly twice the in-state tuition rate.  
Our Legal Californian Residents and Legal Imigrants, who follow the Rule of Law and process deserve further support to attend to THEIR higher education, their DREAMS for THEY are our future.
yea….we have 9% unemployment currently….and alot of those are college grads. We dont need to be handing out free education to illegal immigrants at the cost of American students. This whole thing is ridiculous. We cant support the entire world. USA first.

On-campus and residential liquor and drug law referrals to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards and drug law arrests have increased in the past three years, according to the Dept. of Public Safety Annual Security Report released Friday.
Though non-campus — all non-university owned property — drug and alcohol-related crimes have decreased overall since 2008, most of the reported drug and alcohol activity has occurred on campus. DPS Capt. David Carlisle attributes this increase to changes in reporting methods.
“We were surprised at the numbers but we think it’s a change in reporting method, not a significant change in student behavior,” Carlisle said.
Prior to 2008, DPS policy was that only the host of a party with underage drinking would be reported to SJACS.
After 2008, procedures changed so all under-aged students attending such a dorm party would be cited and reported to SJACS.
DPS Annual Security Report is a public document that includes statistics for the past three calendar years regarding crimes on and off campus, as well as policies regarding alcohol and drug use and sexual assault.
USC’s policy for reporting campus security is in accordance with national guidelines set by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. “On campus,” according to the Jeanne Clery Act, refers to all USC-owned property. It does not include Greek houses, which are considered off-campus housing by the Clery Act and still under DPS jurisdiction.
On-campus liquor law referrals increased substantially between 2008 and 2010, from 29 to 107 to 238. On-campus drug law referrals increased from 47 to 95 to 110. On-campus drug law arrests, although less frequent overall, have also seen an increase, from seven to 11 to 29.
On-campus residential facilities, part of the on-campus area, have seen large increases as well. On-campus residential facilities liquor law referrals went up from 25 in 2008 to 103 in 2009 and 204 in 2010. Drug law referrals nearly tripled between 2008 and 2010, from 42 to 84 to 104.
Though drug and alcohol arrests and referrals have increased on campus in the last three years, the pattern for non-campus arrests and referrals differs. Liquor law referrals decreased from 95 in 2008 to 42 in 2009, and increased to 67 in 2010. Drug law referrals consistently decreased each year between 2008 and 2010, from 63 to 11 to 9.
Carlisle said more arrests and referrals occur on campus than off campus because more people, such as residential advisers and residential coordinators monitor the area, compared to off-campus housing, such as sorority and fraternity houses. Carlisle also said it is more likely that people living off campus are of legal drinking age.
Students attributed the rise in drug and alcohol referrals and arrests to DPS getting stricter.
“I feel like students have always partied, but DPS is cracking down,” said Niko Bijili, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Victoria Tam, a junior majoring in theater, agreed. She said she recently had a party to raise money for a theater show and seven DPS cars came to shut it down.
“It was just really excessive,” Tam said.
The DPS’ job is to protect the safety of USC students, not to arrest the occasional  sneaking of a beer or two at a party.
Rediculous!

Trojans running over Trojans
I have a concern, and it is kind of a big one. It’s about the bicyclists/skateboarders vs. pedestrians thing going on right now.
It is really getting out of control. There are no signs posted as to what the rules are. I have no idea what the rules are, to be honest, but there seem to be no rules — and that is really, really dangerous.
Every day I walk in fear for my life. Seriously. And every day I see bikes crash into each other and skateboarders run into pedestrians and bikers.
Here is the problem: People are getting hurt. They are getting thrown and knocked down. You don’t want Trojans suing other Trojans. Or worse, you do not want someone to find out they are injured and have no idea who hit them later. Or to find out their expensive laptop is now broken, etc.
I mean, what a crappy way to start off your day. And it is happening multiple times, all day long. I do not see the Department of Public Safety around warning people or any signs saying walk your bike, etc.
This, with the new year and new freshmen, is particularly getting out of control.
Perhaps there should be a dedicated lane for bikers/skaters like in all normal road rule areas so that everyone else can steer clear and not get creamed.

Human life should not be taken
On Sept. 21 at 11:08 p.m. EST, Troy Anthony Davis was executed. As a 21-year-old, he was convicted of fatally shooting Savannah, Ga. security guard Mark MacPhail. At his 1991 trial, nine witnesses testified that they had seen Davis shoot the officer, and two of those insinuated that he had confessed to them.
There was never any murder weapon recovered that could be connected, however. During the re-evaluations that happened after Davis received the death penalty, seven of the nine witnesses recanted or changed their testimonies. Furthermore, according to the defense, there is evidence that one of the witnesses who has not recanted should actually be a suspect. Established anti-death penalty organizations, such as Amnesty International and the Campaign to End the Death Penalty, were a major part of early mobilizations in support of Davis. This was because it was already apparent that his trial was both rushed and shallow. Witnesses stated they had felt pressure by police to implicate Davis, and there was also suggestion that the racial make-up of the jury unfairly affected the conviction.
After multiple appeals to state and federal courts, Davis had successfully evaded three execution dates, and gathered more supporters against this injustice with each court date. But he could not escape lethal injection two weeks ago.
People have mobilized internationally this week in demonstrations and actions speaking out against the execution of Davis. From his prison site in Georgia, to Washington D.C., to Paris, citizens of the world picketed with signs stating “I am Troy Davis” and “NO to Legal Lynching.” Even just a couple miles away from USC, people gathered in Leimert Park to cry out and hold vigil in support of Davis and the atrocity that is the death penalty.
Regardless of political leanings, everyone should be able to agree that human life is sacrosanct, and is much too important to be dealt with lightly. If there is any doubt about the guilt of a person, executions should never ever proceed.
In the case of Davis, his death should be considered a murder rather than an execution. In a nation founded under the very idea that everyone has a right to freedom it is unfathomable that such an unfree death could have ever occurred. Davis should not have died.
More than 65 percent of all countries in the world have abolished the death penalty, and it is due time that we speak out against this barbaric form of retribution. How many others have been wrongly put to death because of the death penalty? We say “no more” — not in the name of justice, not in the name of freedom, and never in the name of democracy.

President Barack Obama visited the students of Benjamin Banneker Academic High School in Washington D.C. last Wednesday to deliver his annual back-to-school speech, with one definitive message: Keep going to school. Don’t just finish high school; go to college. And once you’re there, graduate and get a college degree.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
This speech closely paralleled the goal of the controversial No Child Left Behind Act.
In theory, by enacting federal academic requirements that states must meet annually — all of which are based on teaching-to-the-test type standards — the government will help high school students become college and career ready.
But is this really the right message to send to schools? Measuring educational growth and success based on standardized test scores is antiquated and has set a very harmful standard for what is considered valuable in education.
Though No Child Left Behind doesn’t directly impact university-level education, its focus on tests and statistics does.
According to No Child Left Behind, 4,000 California schools are currently “failing.”
Luckily, Obama has recognized No Child Left Behind might be what’s really failing.
Last week Obama lifted the 2014 proficiency deadline — a provision that called every state to set standards in reading and math to be met by 2014 — for states that agree to adopt his administration’s new academic standards.
States can now apply for waivers from some of the law’s provisions and replace them with standards of their own design.
These changes allow for much more flexibility when it comes to measuring student progress and creating teacher evaluation systems.
Most importantly, they open a door for states to shift away from data-driven achievement and toward genuine reform.
There’s no way for high schools to throw out standardized testing altogether or for colleges to stop giving out grades, but with the changes made last week, the next step California takes with the revised law will set an important tone for the state’s education system at every level.
According to No Child Left Behind, standardized test scores are expected to rise every year.
Schools that don’t meet those standards are branded as “failing” and face even more federally imposed requirements and sanctions.
School reform is not motivated or supported in the correct way. Instead, further rigidity is applied as well as a heavy pressure to teach to the test.
Student progress and teacher evaluations shouldn’t be about numbers or meeting requirements.
Neither should the idea of a good school. A good school is about people, interaction, stimulation and creativity.
There is an admitted strength in the reliability of statistics and data, but it cannot define schools.
Some states have already applied for waivers, but California’s decision remains to be seen.
The state should avoid jumping through even more hoops to meet the waiver’s conditions and just keep following NCLB.
There is no requirement or money lost if California doesn’t apply for the waiver.
What the state would lose, however, is a crucial opportunity for it to take its schools in the right direction. It also demands a level of flexibility that schools will only get closer to achieving through the waiver.
In a New York Times article reporting on Obama’s removal of No Child Left Behind’s “most onerous provisions,” Jack Jennings, president of the Center on Education Policy, suggested “This is the beginning of the end of the No Child era.”
Hopefully it is the beginning of the end of test-driven reform.
The changes to No Child Left Behind have brought a necessary spotlight to education reform in California.
It is now up to the state to address its own flaws, take advantage of the waiver system and move forward.

If I told you to rank the 50 greatest songs in the world, the chances that your rankings would be identical to anyone else’s are slim to none.
We all vary in our preferences for countless characteristics in a song, such as lyrics, melody, tempo or rhythm, so everyone has a unique partiality for what pleases the ear.
College rankings are arguably similar, although these rankings are far from melodic. That’s because U.S. News & World Report, among others like the Huffington Post who put out rankings like “the 10 best places to go to college” and “the best professors,” have the audacity to declare their knowledge of the best colleges in America every year, and people listen.
These schools’ positions are determined, according to the U.S. News & World Report, by gathering “data from and about each school in 16 areas related to academic excellence. Each indicator is assigned a weight (expressed as a percentage) based on our judgments about which measures of quality matter most.”
What these rankings don’t take into account, however, is the subjectivity that goes into college decisions. As cliché as it is, each student’s experience and needs are different. These rankings order through objectivity, discounting any personal reasons students have for making decisions.
Therefore, these lists don’t fully encapsule certain qualities of college and should not be perceived as the holy grail.
The keyword is “judgments.” Like different aspects of a song, everyone will have a distinctive judgment regarding which measures of quality matter most in a school.
And is there anything more superficial than assigning numbers to such a complex four-year experience?
What if one of the measures of quality that matter most to a student is school spirit or location?
These aspects can be extremely important to a college applicant, yet the rankings cannot include them only because claiming a school’s location deserves a 65 percent sounds crazier than claiming a school’s faculty deserves a 65 percent.
U.S. News & World Report insists “many factors other than those spotlighted here will figure in your decision,” but it cannot deny its significance in today’s world when its website includes a countdown marking the release of these rankings.
Despite their lack of substance, the rankings are so accessible and renowned that college applicants are pressured to factor this website’s opinion in college decisions.
These rankings ultimately reflect a prestige associated with higher-ranked schools, and if you select No. 23 USC instead of No. 3 Yale, despite admittance to both, people will initially and naturally judge, without considering your reasoning for being a Trojan.
At the very least, imagine falling in love with a school after a visit, only to skim through these rankings and find that it’s not even on the list. U.S. News & World Report tells you your school is not among the best. You might be able to endure this slap in the face and walk away, but it definitely has the capability to leave a sting.
The rankings are visited so often they are here to stay, but they should not exist.
Or, the word “best” should be replaced to reduce the illusion that the rankings are the one true gauge of school quality.
To prospective students: Refuse to use rankings as an indicator of a school’s quality and envision a world without them, where you do your school research without a preconception clouding your vision of what is or is not the best college for you.

Take Shelter, the sophomore film from writer/director Jeff Nichols, whose previous film, Shotgun Stories, also starred Michael Shannon, is a dark psychological tale of Middle America and paranoia in a modern world.
Prophetic phantasmagoria · The main character of Take Shelter, Curtis LaForche (Michael Shannon), is cursed with intense, prescient dreams that drive the film’s storyline, making the narrative a slow-burning psychological thriller grounded in a sense of tweaked realism. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
Take Shelter is an immensely intimate character-driven film, despite its larger critique of a nation and world fraught with economic and ecological uncertainty.
The film follows Curtis LaForche (Shannon), a man from Ohio with intense dreams about an oncoming storm of such magnitude that it drives people and animals to go mad and violently attack him and his family.
At the start of the film, Curtis has a decent life. His best friend Dewart (Shea Whigham) even tells him so. Despite the fact that his daughter is deaf and he and his wife Samantha (Jessica Chastain) must cope with her condition, they are depicted as loving parents, dealing with the situation as best as they can.
LaForche’s new-found visions, however, start to infect his family life, challenging its previously comfortable situation.
“Anxiety is born out of having something to lose,” Nichols said.
Nichols displays this mantra in vivid realism on screen. Curtis’ real fear is not the disturbing forces revealed in his visions, as much as the idea of abandoning or losing his family.
Still, Curtis is torn between his all-too-vivid visions and the possible reality that he might simply be succumbing to the disease that also took over his mother’s life — schizophrenia. Shannon plays this confusion beautifully and subtly. The slightest tweak of expression on his face speaks myriad emotions.
Shannon’s power comes from his ability to express so much while appearing to do so little. This also, however, gives the moments when he erupts with emotion even more resonance. They stand in stark contrast to his normal state of being. Shannon’s nuanced portrayal of Curtis’ dry, sarcastic sense of humor also helps bring a lighter side to the character and reinforces what made the pre-psychosis Curtis loveable to begin with.
Curtis’ actions are also greatly contradictory. Often, his actions, which he hides from his wife, are driven by his irrational paranoiac fears. He tries extremely hard to hold on to his normalcy, to his decent life, but it’s slipping away and he can’t seem to control it.
His dreams end up leading to the deterioration of most of his closest relationships. He dreams almost everyone he loves turns against him and he seems incapable of forgiving them in reality for what they did in his nightmares. Just as it is difficult for Curtis to separate the two worlds, it too becomes difficult for the viewer at the end of the movie.
The film’s visual effects team, Hydraulx, has worked on films of massive scale such as Avatar, 2012 and Green Lantern, but here the visuals aren’t over-the-top. The effects are simple but effective in their horror. They are never mere spectacle, but instead service the plot and its characters. They are the manifestation of Curtis’ paranoia, something affecting his life in a very real way.
The film, after all, is in many ways a horror film of the Polanski variety. A slow-burning psychological thriller grounded in realism, but ever so slightly off, where the head-space of the main character is paramount.
Polanski is the master of making seemingly mundane events become riddled with intriguing tension. Nichols employs the same tactic with this film.
It’s telling that what might be the creepiest scene in the film is a sequence in which almost nothing happens. Curtis dreams his wife is drenched with water, standing very still in the kitchen. She slowly turns to stare at him. Her eyes then spot a kitchen knife on the counter.
Such simplicity and restraint are why the film works — the unnerving quiet of scenes such as this helps set up other shatteringly loud, bombastic moments. You get the sense as you’re watching the film that it’s slowly and quietly building to something massive, to an explosion.
To top it off, the film is beautifully shot, especially in the way the various storms are framed around the characters viewing them. The storm shelter itself is also noteworthy for its incredible ambiance: a hybrid of a horror movie basement and a World War II bomb shelter, complete with gas masks.
Take Shelter ultimately forces the viewer to question Curtis’ objective reality. The line between dream and truth becomes blurred as elements from one start to bleed into the other. It will force you to reconsider everything you think you’ve just seen. Is Curtis a victim of an uncontrollable storm or some sort of mad prophet?

Think of the classic American backyard party: You crack open an ice-cold bottle of Miller Lite and swig it down while poking at hotdogs sizzling on an outdoor grill. The day is warm, sweetened by a glug of cool fizziness. It’s lazy, it’s relaxing and it’s social.
Oktoberfest has several hundred times more fun and energy. Traditionally held for 16 to 18 days during the last weeks of September to the first weekend of October, this messy, raucous festival is attended by several million people gathering over tens of thousands of bottles of beer and wursts.
For better or for wurst · Wursts, one of the most famous staples to be paired with German beers, have been popping up in L.A. restaurants, such as Wurstküche and Biergarten, as tasty, exotic and even experimental repasts. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
As crazy as it sounds, everyday German beer drinking actually holds a sensible seriousness toward good food and drink. Historically, many breweries in Germany were managed by monks. Oktoberfest is just a two-week exception for people to tap into their inner frat boys under the excuse of tradition.
While beer is mainly a social drink in American culture, beer in Germany is ingrained into the psyche. Centuries ago, the waters were so polluted the people drank beer with their meals as their liquids, and that tradition has stuck for generations. In fact, beer is such a common beverage in Germany that it is often served alongside McNuggets at McDonald’s.
Unlike popular American beers, German beer shares the kind of tradition and artistry typically devoted to wine. Every brewery has its own secret recipe and signature style, and the majority of beer, like Oktoberfest beer, is seasonal and regional. Warm summer weather calls for light and hoppy ale, while fall’s brisker air rouses cravings for the roasted, caramelized malt of Oktoberfest beers.
The belief used to be that American beer tastes like piss and Americans drink beer merely for the brand, but there’s a revolution underway in American beer culture.
While German brewing and beer consumption is dropping — to the distress of many proud German traditionalists, who gloomily labeled the phenomenon as brauereisterben, literally “brewery death” — consumption of specialty craft beers in America has been steadily rising, despite declines in sales for core beer brands like Budweiser.
This dichotomy suggests Americans are developing a more sophisticated taste for quality beers; it’s no longer a bubbly filler, but a serious beverage meant to be enjoyed for its distinct complexities. Some are so passionate about beer they’ve even taken up home brewing and blogging about it.
In Los Angeles alone, it seems every other week there’s a new beer garden popping up, each sharing a passion for great beer but with distinct themes in food and beer pairing.
The most famous staple, of course, is wursts. Wurst, or German processed meat, is one of the essential components in Oktoberfest, but not the main definition of German cuisine. Still, it is the perfect complement to German beer — both are manly, casual and incredibly diverse.
The most common wurst is the bratwurst, a blend of finely ground pork and veal stuffed into casing, but there are more than 100 other varieties, including spreadable leberwurst and cold-cuts usually served with dense bread. In Los Angeles, wursts take the more common form of encased sausages, but can be re-encased in innovative ways.
The popular Wurstküche, which likely initiated the whole wurst and beer revolution with its 2008 opening in Little Tokyo, blends together exotic meats, such as rattlesnake and rabbit, with untraditional spices. Its pairing of unusual wursts and traditional German beers gained huge popularity, so much that it now boasts a second location in Venice.
Ever since Wurstküche sparked the beer hall Liebe across the city, other pubs featuring sausages and beer emerged, such as Steingarten LA on Pico Boulevard, Brats Brothers in Sherman Oaks and Wirtshaus in West Hollywood.
The gastropub Biergarten in Koreatown brings a creative spin by fusing authentic German ingredients into Korean dishes. The German fried rice created by Chef Eddie Hah, for example, is a wok toss of rice with spicy Kolbasa sausage, sauerkraut and spaten dunkel-infused gravy, topped with a runny fried egg.
Biergarten, which opened last year, also features an impressive beer menu that includes seasonal brews, like Sparten Oktoberfest and Hacker Pschorr Oktoberfest, and makes everything in-house, from sauerkrauts to sizzling fat sausages to mouth-watering mustards in which you dip the juicy meats.
Currywurst, a ubiquitous Berlin street food, has also recently infiltrated Los Angeles streets. Berlin Currywurst in Silver Lake, which opened in spring, was the first to introduce this Indian/British/German concoction. Since then, a shop called Currywurst opened up on Fairfax Avenue, serving the same minimal menu of wurst doused in a tomato-based sauce with dashes of curry powder. Neither establishment serves beer because the stalls are too small for a liquor license, a glaring difference between Los Angeles and Germany.
Still, other beer-aficionados have innovated by breaking away from the four wall restraint of stalls. ColLAboration, a mobile craft beer garden, roams the city featuring buzz-worthy events centered on specialty craft beers. And for beer-lovers who want to turn passion into hobby, Culver City and Eagle Rock have home brewing supply stores that offer home brewing classes.
Oktoberfest might be over, but there are still plenty of places to drink and eat the German way. So fill your cup, drink it down, smile with your foam moustache, and cry, “Auf Wiedersehen!”

“I have no desire to go back and play in Blink-182 again,” guitarist/vocalist Tom DeLonge told Spinner.com in 2008.
The 2005 split of seminal pop-punk band Blink-182 was a well-documented meltdown of personalities, driven by newly divisive musical tastes and the sheer exhaustion that set in after so many years of recording and touring.
The band, however, found a way to come back together. The 2008 death of long-time Blink producer Jerry Finn brought the trio in contact again. A mere month later, a private-jet crash nearly killed drummer Travis Barker, leaving him with severe burns.
But these traumatic events led to renewed, albeit tentative, contact that slowly resulted in collaboration and eventually a new album, Neighborhoods.
Music is not easy to create. It takes talent, sure, but perhaps more than anything, it takes sheer chemistry.
It’s hard to say whether the chemistry in the band is back to normal, but Neighborhoods seems to indicate it’s not.
There’s really no other way to explain the disjointed feel of the album. Neighborhoods is, in many ways, a logical continuation of 2003’s self-titled Blink-182 -— it’s still more mature and more musically experimental than Blink’s classic, sophomorically silly pop-punk style that originally brought the band into the spotlight.
But unlike Blink-182, the experimentation and style on  Neighborhoods doesn’t feel nearly as cohesive and purposeful.
Take the lead single “Up All Night,” for instance. The bulk of the song is a perfectly endearing, even catchy, treatise on the day-to-day struggles of life.
Why, then, throw in fragments of a meandering, Metallica-esque thrash riff? It’s almost as if DeLonge and company felt insecure about the verses and choruses standing alone and decided to throw on a flashy and unnecessary musical segment.
And why include an introductory interlude for the very average “Heart’s All Gone?” The roughly two-minute-long instrumental comes off more as something that Explosions In the Sky chose to reject than anything poignant or fitting.
The problem is that from a fundamentally musical standpoint, Neighboorhoods is a decent album. Nothing more, nothing less.
The band touts it as a further expansion of its experimental and serious side, but Neighborhoods sounds a little more like regression.
2003’s Blink-182 took bold gambles and paid off with tracks like the solemnly tragic “I Miss You,” the cleverly riotous “Feeling This” and the explosive, no-holds-barred “Stockholm Syndrome.”
Alas, a listen through Neigborhoods will leave you grasping in vain for potential classics.
That’s not to say the latest album is a failure. “Kaleidoscope” is a rare bit of inspired writing, one that deftly melds deep, crunching guitars with keyboards and a refrain that attacks with the galloping energy that one would expect from Blink.
And songs like “Ghost On The Dance Floor” and the industrial-tinged “Snake Charmer,” although not perfect, show off Blink’s willingness to wander out of its comfort zone, demonstrating a flair for the ambitious and experimental. The eclectic involvement of various effects and synthesizers helps to diversify the sound throughout Neighborhoods, even if it does come off more than a little like Angels and Airwaves.
On the flip side, some of the melodies (“Even If She Falls,” “MH 4.18.2011” and “Wishing Well,” among others) sound like they’ve been ripped straight out of B-sides from 2001’s Take Off Your Pants and Jacket -— definitely a look back instead of forward.
And so it becomes somewhat unclear who this album is really intended for. It’s not really for the Enema of the State crowd; lyrically, it’s far too dark, and musically, it’s too wonky. Then again, it’s not really for the Blink-182 crowd either. If you enjoyed that album’s brazen curiosity of the unfamiliar, Neighborhoods just seems tame in comparison.
But Neighborhoods is still a solid effort from a trio that wasn’t expected to write together ever again. The confidence and focus to move forward isn’t all there, but it’s a start, one that still manages to declare the return of the pop-punk kings to the rock world.
It’s easy to wonder what it was like for DeLonge, Barker and Hoppus to walk into the same studio together again. Most likely it was a little awkward, and maybe curious, cautious and optimistic all at once. A little like Neighborhoods, really.
The disjointedness you mention is part of what makes this album great – it really represents some of the struggles Blink-182 has faced over the past few years as a band and as individuals.

French food might often be seen as rich, but its music rarely gets the same reference or admiration as its cuisine. The Ooh La L.A! Festival, a three-day music event showcasing rising French music artists, seeks to shift the music palate of Los Angelenos toward developing a taste for French music culture.
Its third annual concert was held last weekend at Hollywood’s El Rey Theater, featuring a spectrum of French musical styles: a fun, indie mix of pop, rock, electronic and hip hop. When it comes to music, France’s strength lies in being able to absorb the popular styles of other cultures and embody them as their own.
This international echo of styles and genres is reverberated at Ooh La L.A! Festival. The opening Thursday night kicked off with a vocal performance by Hugh Coltman, an English songwriter and singer who found his fan base in Paris after breaking apart from his British band, The Hoax.
Coltman’s youthful voice is captivating. Although his vocal form seems effortless, his range as a tenor is impressive and soothing like cool brass, while his lyrics are soulful and melancholic. It’s the kind of sweet, sophisticated music you want to pair with French wine and cheese.
The curtain seemed to close too soon at the end of his performance, but it swung back open to a more in-your-face dazzling ensemble: Nouvelle Vague, an idiosyncratic band of vocalists and rock and classical instrument players.
Nouvelle Vague’s opening piece began with deep, darkly ethereal notes released from the blood-red lips of two jet black-haired women dressed in skeleton evening gowns. Behind them, an enthusiastic drummer and a guitarist rocked out the dominant notes punk-style, in curious harmony with the classical aural textures strung by a cellist and a violinist.
This glamorous, almost ghoulish musical collective is a representative of the kind of music that defines 1980s France — a rich incorporation of the 1960s Brazilian bossa nova arrangements of cool jazz and samba rhythms and the 1970s French “new wave” styles of punchy rock beats and poetic lyrics.
After the first night, Friday’s entertainment traveled down across the Mediterranean Sea into northern Africa, with Tuareg musicians Tinariwen and Morocco-born Berber singer Hindi Zahra.
Tinariwen, which means “deserts” in the Tuareq language, strumed out a rocky yet somehow melodious combination of West African-inspired guitar styles and raw, elegiac African blues. Meanwhile, Hindi Zahra meshed sultry, sexy notes together with passionate, romantic lyrics, her voice sometimes exceptionally clear and other times throaty and lush.
The last performance on Saturday hiked up the beats with a more modern remix of electronic music, techno and abstract hip-hop. It’s a wonderful, sensual juxtaposition of vintage melancholia and modern technologies by varied artists such as Entienne de Crecy, DJ Cam, Feadz and Chateau Marmont, and an optimistic finale to the future of the French music scene.
The El Rey Theater set the perfect stage for both artists and audience with its laid back yet elegant atmosphere. With a full-service bar at the back, a small stage upfront, and an open space for the attendees to either sit back or mingle with beer in hand, the venue is like a younger reinvention of a hip jazz lounge that a 1950’s couple would visit for a casual, romantic date.
The exclamation “ooh la la!” is meant to conjure up an image of a beret-donning, turtle-necked French person reacting to something exciting and thrilling, and when it comes to this festival, it’s aptly named. By presenting a different variety of music other than the stereotypical French opera and folklores, the Ooh La L.A! Festival has revealed the richness and youthfulness of the French spirit towards music.

Biergarten is known for its fabulous German-Korean fusion dishes, but this weekend, it’s staying true to German roots in honor of Oktoberfest.
The weekend-only menu, created and executed by pop-up chef Gary Robins (former chef of the now shuttered MoKo), is one of the few around town specially dedicated to the Oktoberfest celebration of German beer and food.
German cuisine might be known as rich and simple, but under the deft, thoughtful hands of Robins, every dish is structured to pair perfectly with the distinct texture and styles of German beers.
Take the humble potato pancake (or Kartoffelpuffer), for example. Robins’ version comes in a flattened two-toned golden cake — crisp and crunchy on the outside, warm and creamy on the inside. The cake is topped with homemade applesauce and luscious sour cream. For an extra $5, you can also get sashimi-like slices of Williamsbire cured Atlantic salmon.

Or if you’re feeling a tad more extravagant, how about the truffle-scented golden-brown Rosti with air-dried ham, ginger crisp apples and bittersweet chicories?
Another outstanding option is the schnitzel burger: perfectly brown ground veal patty, topped with sweet and sour red onion marmalade, spicy arugula, tangy remoulade and cave-aged gruyere. It’s as multi-decked and multi-flavored as you can get in between a bun.
Of course, it’s not Oktoberfest without some sausages. Get both wursts — the weisswurst, a fat, tight link of “white” meats seasoned with light Riesling and green chilies, or the venison wurst, a darker, smokier sausage stuffed with a sweet and gamey mix of ground venison, dried sour cherries, sage and lambic (a fruity German beer).

They’re even more complex and lovely when you sip together German beer with each bite; a light hoppy ale smoothes out the richness of weisswurst, and a raspberry lambic really accentuates the sweet gameness of the venison wurst.
All sausages are ground and stuffed in-house, and so are the krauts and mustards that comes with them. The kraut either comes in lighter, sour Sauerkraut (slow-cooked cabbage with onions, Riesling and bacon) or the sweeter, crimson Rotkraut (red cabbage, braised nice and slow with apples, onions, smoked bacon and juniper berries). They are so good that you’ll want to ask for a vat of each.
Perhaps one of the reason all of the dishes taste so wonderful with beer is because many of the ingredients are cooked with some kind of beer or wine.
All choices on the beer menu are open, but don’t forget to ask for the seasonal Oktoberfest beer, a malty, amber-colored beverage that brings out an intense caramelized flavor when paired with meats.

Getting hungry? Clear up your weekend. Today is the last time the Oktoberfest menu is ever going to be served.
At Biergarten’s Oktoberfest, Oktoberfest is no longer just an excuse to chug down plenty of beer — it’s a revelation to how multilayered German food and drink can be.

The app, called Pam+ (“Patient Advisory Module”), could help heart patients adjust medication to maintain a healthy blood pressure, similar to the manner in which diabetics use insulin and blood sugar readings. Patients might then be able to better manage their health and reduce hospitalization.
The app works in conjunction with an external device — developed by St. Jude and currently in clinical tests — placed over the heart to charge the implanted sensor and obtain data from it. This data is then sent to a server at St. Jude that analyzes it and returns, via the app, the latest readings and information about ongoing trends. Patients can share this data with their doctors and family members.
The app will display the message “Your heart thanks you” to patients who regularly monitor their heart pressure over the course of a week. Users also accrue points for using the application that might eventually be connected to iTunes store or Amazon credit for redemption.
“We want patients to be able to access data but also to be rewarded and encouraged on a daily basis, so they don’t feel like their whole life is a diet,” said Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist and director of the Center for Body Computing at USC, in an interview with MIT Technology Review.

A new student organization, Asian Americans in Arts and Humanities, held its first board meeting Friday.
The goal of the organization is to bring together Asian American arts and humanities students and provide support, advice and information, in addition to providing members the opportunity to explore career opportunities and networking.
Alumni will also be contacted for advice and to establish alumni connections for career opportunities.
 
“Arts and humanities majors face pressure in the Asian American culture — there is a cultural pressure to pursue a ‘practical’ major, even if you’re passionate about humanities or the arts,” said Yuan Tao, a senior majoring in psychology and English and the organization’s president. “We’re not here to pressure anyone to either study humanities or not to — we’re just here to provide support and give information so that everyone can make their own choice.”
 
Despite the organization’s name, students from all backgrounds and majors are welcome to join.
 
“Anyone is welcome to join regardless of cultural background, since pressure and expectations are something many people deal with, regardless of their cultural background,” said Tao.
 
The organization held its first board meeting on Friday. Students interested in membership or leadership opportunities can contact yuantao@usc.edu.
