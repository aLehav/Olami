USC will hold all classes through video call for a three-day trial period starting Wednesday to test backup measures in light of the continued spread of coronavirus, Provost Charles Zukoski announced Friday in a letter to the USC community. USC said the arrangement will ensure faculty and students are prepared in case the spread of coronavirus prevents the University from holding in-person classes. 
This move comes after Los Angeles County declared a public health crisis Wednesday and after USC canceled all international University-sponsored spring break programs and Maymesters earlier this week. On Friday, the University of Washington and Stanford University shifted all classes online for the remainder of the quarter following the continued spread of coronavirus in their regions. 
“As the COVID-19 (coronavirus) situation evolves, your safety and wellbeing are our main priority,” the letter read. “As a result, we continue to take precautionary measures to ensure that we are prepared for any potential disruptions to teaching and learning at USC.”
Classes and office hours will be held on video call service Zoom to ascertain that USC is fully equipped to shift learning platforms. Faculty will also use Blackboard to communicate with students regarding assignments, according to the letter. The arrangement will affect all of USC’s 7,000 in-person classes at the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.
The trial period will precede spring break, during which USC administrators will gather feedback on the platform’s feasibility and apply changes as needed should the situation require a long-term solution, Zukoski said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. The Emergency Operations Center, which monitors coronavirus epidemic developments and makes recommendations on University operations with input from local health officials, has been working for nearly two weeks to prepare faculty from each school to implement courses virtually.
The University has continued to emphasize that there is no immediate threat to the USC community, calling the test run a precautionary measure to execute a smooth transition of learning in the event that the campus is shut down.
“The key [thing] to emphasize is that this really is only a test,” Zukoski said in the interview. “We simply need to be vigilant and aware of what’s going on around us.”
During the three days of online instruction, the University will continue to function on its typical schedule. Residential facilities, dining halls, libraries and health centers will remain open and campus activities will continue as planned, according to the letter. Staff and faculty are expected to work their normal hours on campus.
Zukoski said that while the trial period could lead to confusion among students and professors, it is a necessary step as the University prepares for the possibility of a shutdown. 
The Emergency Operations Center group currently meets multiple times per day to evaluate the need for further precautionary measures and changes to University protocol.
USC has continued to reevaluate its cautionary measures as the coronavirus epidemic develops based on input from the committee. Over the last two weeks, USC has brought students back from many of its study abroad programs in Europe and Asia in addition to canceling all upcoming international spring break programs and Maymester classes. 
“We have a policy of following public health and [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] rulings, and it’s business as normal until that time, but we continuously assess the situation,” Zukoski said. “These emergency operations committees meet two or three times a day and look at all of the information that is coming in.”
As of Friday, L.A. County has 13 confirmed cases of coronavirus and has freed state and federal funds to address the spread by declaring a public health crisis. Gov. Gavin Newsom also declared a state of emergency Wednesday following California’s first death from coronavirus in Placer County.  
Three UCLA students were tested for coronavirus Friday morning and held in self-isolation. UCLA has not announced plans to cancel classes but will continue to monitor the situation, according to a news release from the university.

If you’re looking for intrigue surrounding USC’s Saturday showdown with UCLA, you don’t have to look very hard. The Trojans have a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament to play for, a March Madness berth to earn and a crosstown rival to gain bragging rights over for the second time this season.
But one thing about this game that shouldn’t fly under the radar of USC fans (but probably will fly under the radar of those in control at Heritage Hall) is how Saturday could change the fate of head coach Andy Enfield.
Let’s start with the tangible ramifications of the matchup, because there are plenty, and they all tie back into Enfield. After USC’s huge wins against Arizona and Arizona State, I’ve heard a lot of people claim the Trojans now need to win just one more game to get into the Big Dance, whether that win comes Saturday at Galen or next week in Vegas.
That seems awfully overgenerous and oversimplified. Yes, UCLA has been playing great basketball recently, and a win would certainly stand out on the Trojans’ resume. But if USC were to knock off UCLA at home but then lose to some subpar team like Washington or Oregon State in the first round of the Pac-12 tourney, is that really enough? Can the selection committee accept a team which has not only failed to pick up a truly impressive win away from home all year, but has also shown an inability to take care of a conference bottom feeder when the stakes are high?
If the Trojans were to fall to UCLA, they’d have to dig themselves out of a hole larger than one win against one of said bottom feeders. They’d have to take care of business in the first round, then go and handle a tough opponent such as Colorado or Arizona State in the quarterfinal, and at that point, they would need a win to avoid dropping two out of their last three games against good but far from unbeatable opponents — not a great look for a bubble team ahead of the tourney. 
But if USC can take care of UCLA and earn a spot in the second round in Vegas — whether that’s via a bye or a first-round win — the Trojans will be sitting in the driver’s seat for cracking March Madness. It will also put Enfield in the driver’s seat for keeping his job. And while the topic hasn’t been publicized much, if athletic director Mike Bohn and other department officials haven’t started having conversations about Enfield’s future with the program, well, they should. 
On the surface, this looks like an unquestionably successful season for a team that isn’t known as a traditional NCAA basketball powerhouse. The Trojans are 21-9 and have played themselves into the conversation for the NCAA Tournament, which they haven’t made since 2017.
But that’s the problem: They haven’t made the tournament since 2017. And if this year’s group can’t do it, there has to be a long look into whether the program is under the right leadership. 
Yes, Enfield has brought in several solid recruiting classes since taking over, notably No. 7 in 2019, No. 18 in 2018 and No. 19 in 2014. No, it’s not quite Duke, which has had four top classes and six top-three in that span, but it’s solid nonetheless.
And what do the Trojans have to show for it? Two March Madness appearances? Two combined wins in those tournaments — one of them coming in the First Four? What good is strong recruiting when it doesn’t turn into wins? 
I understand this team is young and inexperienced. But in today’s college basketball landscape, that’s what coaches have to deal with. What plagues this team at times is indiscipline, and that has to be an indictment on the coaching staff. 
Look, I really don’t like framing other USC sports teams in the context of the football program, but this one just feels too obvious. The Trojans started off the season hot and looked promising, then hit a cold stretch in the middle of the season. Eventually, they got out of it, but not before fans started calling for the job (or head, in football’s case) of the head coach. Then they picked it up at the end of the season and set themselves up for a huge showdown against their most hated rival. 
One coach came out on top in that regular season finale, and I hold that had he not, he’d have been long gone. The other, we’ll see. 
A win in this game alone shouldn’t cool Enfield’s seat entirely, but it would go a long way toward putting USC in March Madness, which should. Plus, not to mention, it would likely spoil UCLA’s comeback season and hamper its chances at a March Madness berth, and it’s no secret that the athletic department loves seeing the Bruins fail.
The parallels, while parallel, aren’t exact. Helton’s seat was hotter entering the season, his team wasn’t as good, the cold stretch was longer, the letdowns were more letdown-y. 
But Bohn’s apparent approach to the situation was telling. Like he said in his introductory press conference at John McKay Center Nov. 7, good programs finish strong. 
Enfield and the Trojans have established themselves as a good program. But they have to finish strong. 
And that starts tomorrow.

Entering Saturday’s tilt against UCLA with a 10-7 conference record, head coach Andy Enfield and the USC men’s basketball team are aiming for their first March Madness appearance since 2017. While the Trojans are more likely than not to make the tournament, nothing is guaranteed with a matchup against UCLA and the Pac-12 Tournament on the horizon.
Prominent bracketologists such as ESPN’s Joe Lunardi and NCAA.com’s Andy Katz currently have USC seeded as No. 11 and No. 8 in the NCAA Tournament respectively, but provided how often the Trojans’ projected seeding has fluctuated throughout the course of the season, Lunardi and Katz’s projections offer little security for the Trojan faithful.
After USC’s 2-5 start to February, the Trojans were predicted by many bracketologists to make the tournament as a “First Four” team, meaning they would have to win a play-in game to earn a spot in the NCAA Tournament’s field of 64. 
However, thanks to its recent victories over Arizona and Arizona State, USC dug itself out of that First Four hole and is now projected to make the tournament by a bevy of analysts including the ones mentioned above. 
This is subject to change, however, based on USC’s performance during its next two — to potentially five — games. Should USC lose two in a row — to UCLA and in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament — the odds of making the March Madness bracket would diminish significantly. 
TeamRankings.com, which runs thousands of computer simulations of March Madness seeding selections, currently gives USC a 57% chance to make the tournament and a 5% chance to secure an automatic bid by winning the Pac-12 Tournament.
Before USC’s game against Arizona last Thursday, the Trojans were 8-7 in the Pac-12, had just suffered bad losses to Colorado and Utah and were falling fast in their hunt for a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament.
But USC’s back-to-back wins have provided the Trojans a boost from the likes of a First Four bubble team to a team that looks poised to make the Tournament and skip that play-in altogether. 
USC is currently in a four-way tie with Arizona State, Colorado and Arizona for third place in the Pac-12 conference. By virtue of an 0-2 season series with Colorado, the Trojans would lose that tiebreaker, but the scenarios involving the other two teams get tricky. 
There are several possible situations the Trojans could find themselves in after Saturday’s game. Oregon and UCLA have secured first rounds byes, but the other two byes are up for grabs between the four tied teams.
USC will get a bye if USC, Arizona State and Arizona all win. USC gets a bye if it and no more than one other team (it does not matter which) wins. Finally, if USC loses to UCLA, there is still hope for the Trojans to secure a bye: If Arizona and Colorado both also lose and Oregon loses to Stanford, USC will skip the first round. However, if all four teams lose, USC will have to play in the first round Wednesday.
A first-round bye could do wonders for the Trojans. If they were to finish the regular season as a No. 5 seed, they would have to get through the first round Wednesday night before turning around to face off against the likely No. 4 seed the very next day.
On the other hand, if the Trojans sneak into that No. 4 seed, they would be afforded an extra day of rest and would wait to face the winner of a matchup between the No. 5 seed and the conference’s No. 12 seed — or the winner of No. 6 vs No. 11 if they steal the No. 3 seed.
Under these circumstances, the Trojans’ path to the later rounds of the Pac-12 Tournament would be much more manageable, putting them in a strong position to secure an invitation to the Big Dance. And, if the Trojans knock off UCLA and secure the first-round bye, they may already be essentially locked in, even in the event of a first-round loss to a solid opponent such as Colorado. 
USC’s postseason picture will certainly look much clearer after Saturday and again after the Pac-12 Tournament. The NCAA March Madness Selection Show is March 15 at 3 p.m. on CBS.

The USC women’s basketball team emerged victorious in the first round of the Pac-12 tournament Thursday, defeating Colorado by a score of 69-54. The win is USC’s second victory over the Buffs in less than a week and advances the Trojans to the second round of the tournament. 
“I was really happy with the effort tonight,” head coach Mark Trakh said after the game. “There were two good teams, it was a battle up and down, but [I’m] just happy with the way our kids performed.” 
USC was led by a dominant duo of forwards in freshman Alissa Pili and senior Kayla Overbeck, who impressed all night for the Trojans.
In what will be one of her last games in the cardinal and gold, Overbeck’s physicality was on full display. The senior finished the evening without missing a single field goal attempt, racking up 10 points along with eight hard-fought rebounds while making life extremely difficult for Colorado’s bigs on the low block. 
Overbeck said USC’s recent run of success comes as no surprise to the team.
“The poise that you see is the poise that we’ve built since before September,” Overbeck said. “You know, playing together and really trusting each other in key moments.”
Pili, who was named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year earlier this week, continued her dominance by leading her team with 22 points on top of five rebounds. Pili also recorded a block and a steal on the defensive end. 
The Trojans also received assistance from graduate guard Aliyah Jeune, who returned to action for the first time since Feb. 14 after being sidelined with a knee injury. 
USC started the first quarter strong with an 8-0 run that helped push its lead as high as 10 with less than three minutes to go in the quarter. USC finished the period with a solid 7-point lead before a strong second quarter run by the Buffaloes evened things up at 32 apiece heading into the second half.
After squandering the lead, USC was once again on its heels, withstanding a barrage of baskets on the inside from Colorado sophomore forward Peanut Tuitele, who finished the evening with 18 points and seven rebounds.
Toward the end of the third quarter, USC freshman guard Endyia Rogers showed off some impressive court vision to find freshman guard Alyson Miura in the corner for a pair of quick succession threes that provided USC a precarious 3-point lead entering the fourth quarter.
Fortunately for USC, momentum was on its side for the rest of the game. A 20-8 fourth quarter stretched the Trojans’ lead to as much as 15 as USC coasted to the win.
Rogers finished the game with 15 points and six assists in yet another impressive outing after scoring 20 points against the Buffs during last Sunday’s regular season finale. 
Miura tacked on another three in the fourth to finish the game with 9 timely points off the bench for USC.
The Trojans will now shift their attention to a difficult matchup against UCLA. The Bruins enjoyed a first-round bye after receiving the tournament’s No. 2 seed. 
Trakh believes USC’s chances at an NCAA Tournament bid shouldn’t be written off just yet. 
“Let’s keep going and see if we have an outside chance at the NCAA,” Trakh said. “Tomorrow’s gonna be really really tough, but … we’re going to enjoy tonight because as far as I’m concerned, we’re playing with house money right now.”
UCLA and USC have faced off twice this season. After the Trojans were blown out in the two teams’ first matchup Dec. 29, they rebounded just weeks later to upset the Bruins in double overtime, ending UCLA’s run as the only remaining undefeated team in women’s college basketball. 
In that win, USC enjoyed the good fortune of not having to face junior forward Michaela Onyenwere, UCLA’s leading scorer, who missed the contest after being considered a game time decision. Onyenwere is averaging 18.8 points per game and will pose a significant threat on the offensive end for Trakh and co. to contain. 
The Trojans are now winners of four games in a row and will head into Friday’s game with plenty of momentum on their side. The postseason edition of the crosstown showdown is set to tip off at 6 p.m. in Las Vegas.

The USC men’s basketball team will play its season finale against UCLA at Galen Center Saturday. The Trojans enter the matchup tied for third place in the Pac-12 at 10-7, while the crosstown rival Bruins are tied atop the standings at 12-5, riding a seven-game win streak. 
The Trojans are also playing solid basketball of their own, coming off strong performances against Arizona and Arizona State last week to further strengthen their bid for the NCAA Tournament heading into Saturday’s game.
“We just have to keep defending like we have been,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “We had two good defensive efforts [last] week, holding Arizona to 48 points, Arizona State to 61.”
Apart from the intensity of the historic USC-UCLA rivalry, the stakes are very high for the final regular season game, as it has the potential to heavily alter both teams’ final standings in the Pac-12. The Bruins sit tied with Oregon atop the conference, while the Trojans are in a four-way tie for third place with Arizona State, Colorado and Arizona.
With such a tight race, each game across the conference has enormous implications for Pac-12 seedings ahead of what figures to be a tightly contested tournament in Las Vegas next week. 
“I’m sure that our team, as well as many other teams, are going to have the confidence that they can win as many games as anybody else in Las Vegas,” Enfield said. “I think the league is wide open.”
Coming off a pair of team-high scoring performances — 14 points against Arizona and 23 against Arizona State — senior guard Jonah Mathews emphasized the importance of remaining calm and confident against UCLA.
“Just come out and play my game,” Mathews said of his mindset. “Coach put me in a position to score, I had to take care of the ball, do what I do, get my teammates involved.”
USC is looking to sustain its momentum after recording a pair of critical wins against the Wildcats and Sun Devils. After experiencing a cold stretch during conference play in which they lost five of seven, the Trojans have come alive again.
UCLA is looking to preserve its No. 1 spot in the conference standings, but doing so may be a tall order against a Trojan team with a 13-2 record at home. The Bruins started the season in full sprint with an impressive four-game win streak only to have it come to a crashing halt around the holiday season, going 1-6 from mid-December to mid-January. Since that cold stretch, however, the Bruins have surged back, going 11-2. 
The last time the two teams met was in Westwood on Jan. 11, when USC came out on top 74-63. Senior forward Nick Rakocevic led the winning effort with a 17-point, 14-rebound outing, adding three blocks. He will be a key player to watch Saturday, especially given his strong double-double performance against Arizona State. 
For the Bruins, getting junior guard Chris Smith rolling early will be crucial. Smith leads his team in scoring this season and is coming off a 17-point outing against Arizona but shot only 33% from the field and committed a team-high four turnovers. Smith also struggled somewhat from the field when the Trojans visited Pauley Pavilion — shooting 5-of-13 for 16 points — but grabbed 10 rebounds. 
USC will also need to keep tabs on sophomore forward Cody Riley. Riley has scored in the double digits in five of the Bruins’ last seven games. He has also averaged 11.9 points per game through UCLA’s win streak, 3 points higher than his season average.
USC will need players like Rakocevic and freshman forward Onyeka Okongwu to show up on the defensive end in order to slow Smith, Riley and all of UCLA’s scorers. 
Though USC’s story for much of the season has been its youth, the Trojans have four seniors on their roster who have seen playing time this year. 
The 12:15 p.m. matchup will be their last game at Galen Center in their USC careers. 
“I’m gonna miss it,” said Rakocevic, who joked that he’s looking to put up at least 20 shots. “I’m gonna miss my teammates, playing here. It’s been the best four years of my life … I might get a little emotional, but that’s just who I am. I’m an emotional type of dude. But at the end of the day, we’re still looking to win. We still gotta win. So that’s our top priority.”
Mathews, who has played in nearly every game since he arrived as a freshman in 2016, echoed Rakocevic’s sentiment. 
“It’s my last game at Galen ever, so it’s a little bittersweet,” Mathews said. “Going into the game, I’m just gonna give my all. Just gotta give everything I have in the tank.”

Nine miles from Hollywood, in the second largest city in the United States and the epicenter of the current basketball landscape, there’s a 6-foot-9 freshman who’s perfectly content whether the cameras are trained on him or not.
But based on the way USC forward Onyeka Okongwu has taken the Pac-12 and the NCAA by storm this year, it’s hard for the cameras to look anywhere else. Okongwu has grabbed college basketball by the horns, posting 16.2 points, 8.7 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game en route to becoming a possible Pac-12 Freshman of the Year selection and high NBA Draft lottery pick. 
Most players in his situation would take the time to bask in their glory — after all, much of it is justified.
Okongwu? Not so much.
“Media outlets and all that — I’m not really for it at times, but I’ll do it,” Okongwu said. “But it’s not something I’m eager to do. I’m just not like that. I just play basketball, man, that’s what I’m here for. Not for the spotlight, none of that.”
The attention is nothing new for Okongwu. He didn’t exactly come out of nowhere when he burst onto the collegiate hoops scene — he had been making a name for himself since well before his Trojan debut.
An alumnus of Chino Hills High School and its wildly successful basketball program, Okongwu came to USC with three state championships and back-to-back California “Mr. Basketball” awards under his belt. He was also the No. 2 overall recruit in the state, trailing only Trojan teammate and fellow forward Isaiah Mobley. 
Dennis Latimore, Okongwu’s coach at Chino Hills for the last two years of his high school career, has watched his success brew for a while. 
“He wasn’t a guy that played around — he wanted to come right in and he wanted to work hard,” Latimore said. “When we were in our practices, he listened, he wasn’t talking when the coaches were talking. He did the drills hard, watched hours and hours of film, especially throughout the playoffs both years … very hard worker.”
Okongwu’s Chino Hills teams were consistently among the best in the country. He played with all three of the Ball Brothers: Lonzo his freshman year and LiAngelo and LaMelo his freshman and sophomore years. Chino Hills won the California Interscholastic Federation state championship in Okongwu’s freshman, junior and senior years, and the team put together a 60-game winning streak across his freshman and sophomore years.
After experiencing that kind of spotlight throughout his entire Chino Hills career, Okongwu was unfazed by the even brighter lights of the NCAA.
“I’m just now used to big matchups,” Okongwu said. “I’m used to being in the limelight. I’m used to being in a big atmosphere, you know, all the attention. So it transferred over here to college ball, so I’m not really afraid or tame or nervous like I would be or any other incoming freshman would be.”
Okongwu jumped onto the national stage in January of his junior year when Chino Hills traveled to Springfield, Mass. to take on current New Orleans Pelicans forward Zion Williamson and Spartanburg Day School. 
Did Okongwu falter in the shadow of the eventual No. 1 NBA Draft pick? Not at all.
Okongwu racked up 35 points — 1 fewer than Williamson — in a 6-point Chino Hills victory. He added 14 rebounds and five blocks to Williamson’s six and two, respectively. 
“The pressure never really got to him,” Latimore said. “He would do the same routine every game. He’d be the last out of the locker room. I believe he would say a prayer or have some type of reflection … He had the same responses to me and that same preparation whether we were playing Zion Williamson’s team or whether we were playing Rancho Cucamonga or Upland High School.”
Latimore, who played Division I basketball himself, would often work with the post players in practice. It was then that the 6-foot-8, 230-pound former Arizona and Notre Dame forward knew he had something special on his hands.
“When he and I would do one-on-one drills, and he was even doing this as a junior … he’d put his shoulder into me and I would literally be back on the wall,” Latimore said. “The amount of power and quickness he had? Oh, man. It was amazing.”
So it came as no surprise that Okongwu didn’t skip a beat when he stepped foot on a college court for the first time.
“He adjusted very quickly,” USC head coach Andy Enfield said. “You have the physical tools and the basketball IQ that he has — he just came in here and started playing his game.”
But though Okongwu often makes remarkable basketball feats look effortless, his life off the court has been anything but easy. On July 15, 2014, Okongwu and his family received news that would change their lives forever.
That day, the Okongwu family learned that Nnamdi, Onyeka’s older brother of four years, had been in a skateboarding accident in Chino Hills. 
Nnamdi died three days later from brain injuries.
He was only 17 years old and had finished his second season playing varsity basketball at Chino Hills less than four months prior. Nnamdi was a gifted athlete who led the school to a then-program-best 29-6 record his junior year and had been scouted by several colleges. 
Just like that, he was gone. 
Onyeka, an incoming eighth grader at the time, wanted to carry on his brother’s legacy. Since then, Onyeka has played every basketball game with his brother’s memory in heart and Nnamdi’s No. 21 on his jersey.
“I wear 21 for him, play for him,” Okongwu said. “I’m just living out his dream through me.”
Onyeka and his mother Kate are close, and they relied on each other to get through the tragedy.
“I just knew my mom was hurting, so I just had to stay strong for her, knowing that everything was gonna be alright,” Onyeka said. “She was gonna be alright. My little siblings were all gonna be alright. We were all hurting, but that’s the way life goes.”
Latimore, who doubles as an English teacher at Chino Hills, was also a part of Onyeka’s support system. He recalled assigning his class a three-page reflective narrative essay about an experience that changed their life. 
Okongwu, then a junior, felt close enough with his coach and teacher to write about the day of the accident — what he was doing before he found out, when the police entered his house, going to the hospital. 
“It was like watching a movie from his writing,” Latimore said. “That horrible, tragic event — but the way he was able to articulate that, it was pretty incredible just to read a 17-year-old at the time writing about the loss of his brother. And, just tragic, but at the same time, incredibly written language.”
Latimore said Nnamdi’s legacy — along with Onyeka’s myriad accomplishments — was the reason the school had the No. 21 jersey retired during halftime of a Jan. 31 Chino Hills game this year. Okongwu was joined at the ceremony by Kate and his younger brother Chukwuemeka, a sophomore on the team.
Latimore said Onyeka never sought out attention in high school, often turning down interviews from local newspapers and TV outlets. This attention, though, was different. 
“This was his former team from last year,” Latimore said. “His brother’s still on the team. We felt like it was something that was good for the community, that it was something that was good for his younger brother to see, for our younger players on the team to see. And I just wanted to make sure he recognized that. That ‘Hey, I know you don’t always like the attention, but it’s not just about you. It’s also about your brother.’”
Onyeka has always been close with his family. Despite living at USC now, he still talks to “Chuku” almost every day and calls Latimore frequently to ask how his younger brother can improve. Staying close to his family was a big reason for choosing USC.
“Every time you see them, you just have a huge smile — I have a huge smile on my face because they’re just such nice people,” Enfield said of the Okongwu family. “They’re very caring and loving. And take the basketball away, their whole family is just someone you just enjoy being around.”
Mobley has been around Okongwu for quite some time. The top two recruits in the state played together with the Compton Magic Amateur Athletic Union team back in eighth grade.
Mobley said Okongwu is the same person now that he was back then.
“You can always count on O, he’s a great guy,” Mobley said. “Always uplifting everybody, putting a smile on everybody’s face … He’s just a great guy, loves to joke, super competitive both on and off the floor.”
Okongwu’s competitiveness — which made him clap back at Mobley about winning more state championships after Mobley said he held the all-time one-on-one advantage between the two — shows on the court, but it’s subtle, not at all in-your-face. He won’t try to make himself the center of attention anywhere.
“I don’t like to be in a lot of drama or nothing like that — I just like to stay in my lane,” Okongwu said. “I see other people’s mistakes, I just steer away from what they’re doing. I don’t be in the wrong groups. You know, I stay true to myself … I’m at school just low key. Just put AirPods in and going class to class, minding my business.”
No, Okongwu doesn’t walk around campus with his chest puffed out as if to say, “Look at me, I’m Onyeka Okongwu,” nor does he do so on the court (although he’s probably earned the right). Like he said, that’s just not who he is. He’s here for basketball. For Nnamdi.
So when Okongwu banked in a buzzer-beating prayer from USC’s own free-throw line to end the first half last Thursday against Arizona, how did he celebrate? By parading around the court, screaming along with the Galen Center crowd, posing for photographers by the baseline? 
Nope. 
After a quick swarm by some teammates, Big O bolted for the locker room, a wide grin on his face, one finger pointed up toward the sky.

As she took the stage blinded by blue light and surrounded by an imposing crowd, Mariah Quintero was not one for nerves. She had put in the work and was ready to let that speak for itself. For her and her peers, that work spoke volumes.
The Thornton School of Music’s first-year popular music students assembled at Tommy’s Place Wednesday for their first showcase. At the event, which was also their midterm, students divided into four bands to perform a set of ’70s Motown classics. Though their “first-year” label might imply inexperience, these students occupied the stage with uninhibited confidence, ready to put on a show.
Throughout the semester, students were given three songs each week to perform and master for class. Of these, four songs were selected for the final showcase. As the showcase was a midterm, some of the songs were repeated between the bands, but they never felt stale. Each group brought their own personal flair and artistic choice to the songs; some opted for more contemporary vocals, while others adhered more toward the gospel-influences of the original Motown artists. Though each group’s arrangement varied in approach, there was a consistent energy throughout the show that unified the four bands.
The night opened with an electric rendition of Sam & Dave’s “Hold On, I’m Comin’,” led by Quintero, a junior majoring in psychology who is entering her first year in the popular music program. Her magnetic stage presence and natural chemistry with her band set the tone for the night; it was clear from the start that this cohort wasn’t lacking in spirit nor talent. One performer, Tippy Balady, asked the audience for a little “Respect” before launching into a soulful rendition of Aretha’s finest.
Song selection ranged from fast-tempo, high energy numbers, such as Amii Stewart’s “Knock On Wood,” to more reflective and romantic tracks, such as Otis Redding’s “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay.” The student performers had no trouble adjusting to the range of moods, finding their emotional base and engaging with whatever feelings the song demanded. Whether that called for sky-high ecstasy or subtle melancholy, they were tapped in.
It was easy to see that the thrill of performance was at the forefront of each performers’ mind space. Many of the performers did not face any anxiety before their sets. While she may find herself a bit nervous offstage in “party settings,” Balady noted that she doesn’t suffer from any pre-performance jitters. 
“I wasn’t nervous at all,” said Balady, a freshman majoring in songwriting. “I was more excited to perform and do my craft. On stage, it’s me being my truest self.”
The performers’ sense of enjoyment was intoxicating. Their energy was infectious and lit up the basement at Tommy’s. For keyboardist Isabella Morcote, a freshman majoring in songwriting and popular music performance, getting in the right headspace was paramount. 
“Performing is very much a mental thing,” Morcote said. “You just have to get in the mindset and have fun with it.”
This proved to be a universal feeling among listeners, as many of the audience members found themselves standing up and dancing along to the soulful renditions of some of their favorite ’70s hits. It was very much a concert environment, and it would’ve been difficult not to crack a smile and bust a move while watching such a charming and lively group of young professionals.
From the start of the night it was clear that this cohort — which welcomed themselves with a show-circle and group cheer — was a close one. Sam Bellavance, a freshman popular music major and bassist at Thursday night’s performance, recalls being extremely nervous for the first midterm in the fall, as he was unsure what to expect. But as time passed and the group became more comfortable, all nerves melted away. 
“The cohort becomes super tight within the first semester,” Bellavance said. “I love all of them, and I’ve been working gigs with some of the other singers too.”
While their classmates performed, other members of the cohort shouted cheers of encouragement and even took to the floor to dance along to their friends’ performances. 
“It’s no ego, all love,” Quintero said. “This group really supports each other. We take each other to places we never would’ve imagined.”
“Support” was the word of the night, as there was a tangible feeling of encouragement throughout the room. When the final performance of The Jackson 5’s “I Want You Back” began, much of the room stood to sing and dance along with them. As singer-songwriter Cordelia Degher, a freshman majoring in popular musical performance, belted the final note and the night’s journey came to an end, it felt like a triumph for the entire cohort.
“Everyone is actually really encouraging,” Balady said. “A lot of people think that it’s a high stakes, high pressure situation, but … everyone’s really there to support and we all learn from each other.” 
This sentiment was echoed by freshman popular music student and bassist Austin Brown, who appreciated how quickly the group had transitioned from cohort to community. 
“We’re really just kind of like a family,” Brown said.
Throughout the night, there was no end to the adoration and gratitude the students felt toward Thornton’s faculty; it was clear they were all thankful to have a team of such encouraging and professional mentors. 
“The faculty is unparalleled,” Quintero said. “They give us such individualized attention and want to see us grow.” 
This semester’s first-year students were shepherded by Andy Abad and Patrice Rushen, two GRAMMY-nominated professionals and professors of popular music performance in USC Thornton. There was no shortage of good words for them among the students. At the intermission, Abad thanked his young performers for their hard work and sang their praises, informing the audience that they were witnessing “the future of pop music.” 
Throughout the department, encouragement and enthusiasm were abound among students to staff.

In the coming-of-age comedy “Booksmart,” one of the main characters, Amy (Kaitlyn Dever), a studious, awkward gay woman (relatable) recalls her less-than-enjoyable first experience with weed.
“One time I ate a legal pot brownie when Model U.N. went to Amsterdam. And as soon as I got high, I just cried about the fact that one day my mom will die, so … ” Amy trails off as she rocks back and forth on her heels, eyes glazed over as she replays the horrific, yet hilarious, memory.
This line never fails to take me out, offering a poignant, witty portrayal of the never-the-same-again philosophical and existential effects of cannabis. Undeniably, there’s something about smoking bud that makes you think a lot about a lot of things and scientists don’t exactly know why.
Researching for this column was difficult enough as it was; I’ve said it time and time again, but U.S. policymakers hate weed. So conducting reliable studies on the substance is out of the question until federal legalization. After hours of digging, no substantive research on weed and its connection to increased existential thoughts or feelings came up.
Aside from a couple dozen forums with titles like “When the weed so sativa you start having existential crises” and broad discussions on stoner philosophy, I couldn’t find much information about how pot fits into the pothead equation.
But nearly every friend of mine that I asked told me that cannabis amplifies or ignites feelings of existentialism, a philosophy that purports humans have no preexisting purpose and therefore must choose how they establish their essence, or what makes them them, through acts of their own free will. 
Simply put, there is no predetermined explanation to anything and it is up to each individual to find their purpose and meaning in life. We’re born into a largely indifferent world in which our actions have little, if any, inherent value. Not to be confused with nihilism — which states that everything is hopelessly meaningless — existentialism does seek answers; it just outlines the world in which we’re seeking answers as answerless, or absurd.
Jean-Paul Sartre, who popularized existentialism, believed humans were “condemned to be free,” meaning the freedom people have to form their own morality is actually an impossible, dreadful task. Since nothing has meaning and no one knows anything, every authority figure you can think of to look to for answers is fake because there are no real answers.
But wait! Before I lose you to a crisis, Sartre also believed in the power of humans to assign meaning to their lives — a liberating reality and one that allows people to live a life that is truly authentic and their own. 
So back to weed — while still not empirically proven, research has established some links between cannabis and increased creative thought. In low doses, cannabis can amplify ideas and improve focus; however, being high also makes people more susceptible to outside stimuli, leading to distracting thoughts and thus, in some cases, deep philosophical discussion.
Initial studies have also shown cannabis boosts divergent thinking, a type of measurable creativity that explores problem-solving and spontaneous thinking. Divergent thinking, often used in brainstorming exercises or other outside-the-box thinking, is controlled by the frontal lobe of the brain, which research has shown cannabis activates through increased blood flow. 
But while a study conducted in 2014 showed that originality, a type of divergent thinking, significantly increased after smoking, other studies are inconclusive. Another study by the University College London in 2011 found that already creatively skilled people may be insignificantly affected by cannabis’ creativity boost.
So perhaps part of the explanation is pop culture’s fascination and romanticization with drugs and its conflation with strokes of genius, driving the association between cannabis and wisdom. It doesn’t help that philosophy students are statistically more likely to take drugs than students in any other field.
In this way, the stoner-philosopher trope has entered the mainstream. Shows such as “BoJack Horseman” and “Rick and Morty,” which have distinctive tones that find humor in bleakness and the world’s cynicism, have been co-opted by stoners for their own niche enjoyment. Even more serious shows such as “Black Mirror” are great philosophical think pieces that are enriched, and definitely made more astounding, by cannabis use. (Watch “Bandersnatch” three times in a row high, trying to reach every possible ending, and you’ll see what I mean.)
In essence, cannabis can help enable us to ask important questions: Who are we? Are we alone in the universe? Am I a good person? Where did I put my lighter again? 
With increased cognizance of our surroundings and the role we play in the world, cannabis can make clear — and proximate (therefore, scary) — the seeming insignificance yet concrete profoundness of our existence.
In my experience, and that of my friends’, cannabis unlocks different potential approaches to problems, as we are less hindered by uncertainty or the fear of being wrong and feeling unintelligent. While the substance clouds the mind, it also paradoxically clears it for more important thoughts to surface.
So what, you smoke weed and suddenly discover the theory behind the origins and purpose of the universe? Definitely not, but not smoking weed hasn’t led us to the answer either.

MASS Design Group executive director Michael Murphy spoke about the importance of integrating sustainability and ethical practices into architecture at the USC Wong Conference center Wednesday night. Accompanied by senior principal partner Kelly Doran, the two discussed how their nonprofit incorporates justice with beauty and creates carbon positive buildings that are the future of architecture. 
MASS Design Group is a team of more than 120 architects, craftsman, researchers and artists who are reimagining the building process from design to construction. They prioritize using locally sourced, high quality wood, brick and tile to reduce environmental impact through the entire supply chain. This ensures that the project is durable and will last without the need for continual repairs that create waste and require more materials. They also focus on using ethical labor by hiring from within the community of a new building site, which ultimately facilitates long-term economic growth. 
“MASS Design Group’s identity as a design firm is based on it’s assertion of having a mission to research, build and advocate for architecture that promotes justice and human dignity,” said Milton Curry, dean and professor at the School of Architecture. 
Doran presented on the recent MASS project in Rwanda, which aims  to build a new campus for the Rwanda Institute for Conservation Agriculture. The project exemplified the benefits and possibility of using locally sourced materials and labor for a large-scale project. 
“The making of the building, aside from fasteners and tools, was entirely of the place and sourced 10 kilometers of the site,” Doran said. “Economically, this has a profound impact. The construction of this project is $250,000. Not a penny of that was spent on materials aside from a few nails and tools, so that all went into labor.”
The company uses local artisans for everything from bricks to lamps woven from banana leaves. One mason, Ahkiza from Rwanda, has supplied MASS Design group with his stonework for years.
“We’ve seen ongoing entrepreneurship emerge,” Murphy said. “We worked very closely with a series of masons and one of them is a gentleman by the name of Akiza. We still work with Ahkiza today, he  has continued to do that same masonry work for 10 years with us and in doing so has started his own masonry guild.”
In addition to his efforts abroad, Murphy is implementing his vision of a more sustainable future in his hometown of Poughkeepsie, N.Y. The once thriving fringe city experienced a mid-century population decline, he said. Many buildings, which have been abandoned for decades, are now uninhabitable and most companies are not up to the task of restoring the city. 
“When developers come to the city of Poughkeepsie at the end of a late market cycle, they inevitably find that the margins are too slim in order to invest and they give up,” Murphy said. 
As a nonprofit, MASS works wherever they are needed. An office is now open in Poughkeepsie and many sites across the city have been preserved and refurbished to better serve the community, with some sites now serving as cultural centers, Murphy said. 
When his team arrived in Poughkeepsie, it sought to repurpose abandoned spaces while still preserving the U.S. history that is frequently lost during urban renewal.
“This was an old garage which held the trolleys that went up and down Main Street — I had no idea what it was,” said Murphy, who did the design for free so that the project could get built. “But just pulling back that front door and seeing that it was this beautiful old piece of infrastructure, connecting with another nonprofit there, asked if it could be a new art and cultural space.”
In addition to pursuing more ethical construction practices, MASS is committed to promoting social justice through their projects. The company designed and built the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala., to recognize the ongoing impact of slavery and racial terror. 
The monument consists of 800 steel tablets suspended from the ceiling, one for every county where lynching occured and each with the name of a victims and the date of their death.
“When you come up to it, you’re brought into this selective journey where you are forced to read and engage with the actual history of these places, by county, by name, by date,” Murphy said. “And then inquire, ‘Where are we?’”
The Gun Violence Memorial Project is another work of remembrance created by MASS. The memorial comprises four glass houses made of 700 bricks representing the 700 lives lost each week to gun violence in the United States. Within each brick is an object of significance from a victim of gun violence provided by the families. The memorial’s goal is to stop treating victims of gun violence as statistics or numbers and instead make it personal to show that each victim was an individual, precious life lost, according to MASS Design Group’s website. 
The memorial originally debuted in the Chicago Cultural Center in September, and the reaction was so profound that Murphy decided that they had to continue expanding. 
“It was amazing to see that this is an active, living memorialization process, one that gave us real hope that this could go to a larger scale,” Murphy said. “Could we continue collecting objects, fill thousands of these bricks and then take the project all over the country — one for every state, one for D.C., one for native lands — and put 52 of these on the National Mall?”
This integration of architecture and activism captivated the audience, which was made up primarily of USC architecture students. Devin Kidde, a junior majoring in architecture who has admired MASS and Michael Murphy’s mission for years, thinks that this sustainably focused design model is where the architecture business is heading.
“I saw his TED Talk when I was in high school, and it’s honestly the reason I decided to get into architecture school,” Kidde said. “I really hope that a lot of what he’s doing with taking a step back and looking at architecture as a nonprofit business design. I hope that that can take off in the future.”
Murphy, Doran and MASS know that they cannot change the world’s infrastructure alone, but they hope to act as a leading example of how others can change the world through whatever their medium may be. 
“This emergence, this illumination, is a commitment to what I call the construction of dignity,” Murphy said. “That we have the possibility to do more with what we have in front of us.”

Each and every one of us is a mosaic of people, places and experiences; our surrounding environments inform and shape us, as we inform and shape them. Growth equates to finding differences within or without you that you then apply to yourself, whether by affinity or necessity. We become a collage of those characteristics and thoughts that stick to us as we go through life, either by being characteristics that we like or by remaining unbudging before us and forcing us to take them in. 
When I was younger, I moved from place to place, my feelings and understanding of home consequently becoming ever more obfuscated. I used to find solace in the romanticized notion that the more I traveled and expanded myself, the more agency I developed in choosing who I wanted to be, aside from others’ expectations. I thought of myself selectively being able to take in what I liked from every place I visited and person I met, absorbing all their best qualities as my own. 
For there was no sole perspective or place that offered an all-encompassing truth. Quite the opposite, actually: two paradoxical truths could exist, both completely at odds with each other and yet both equally as valid. Being from a different culture, color or creed did not mean better, or worse, or enlightened or misled — simply different. And from all differences put together, nothing but greater strength for all could be acquired.
While such lessons will always be true, what I have learned lately, however, is that although a noble pursuit, exposing yourself to more and more doesn’t necessarily equate to continued self-improvement. 
While it is true that there are always refinements to be made, I have begun to come to terms with the idea of allowing myself to settle; as any weary traveler after a long journey ought to. To cherish what I know to be good, and make good standing by it; to forget about all else that might potentially come. To stop desperately craving to absorb everything that comes before me and begin to create my own opinions out of what I already have had the privilege to absorb.
It is a privilege to have been exposed to diverse societies, world views, languages and cultures that so many expats such as myself have experienced in their own semi-nomadic journey, though many times throughout such a journey I must admit to have forgotten myself and seen it as a curse. A curse of always being the new kid, of always being the different one and the one that might stand out if he is not already singled out, of having certain agitations about oneself and misgivings about a lack of foundation that others not constantly moving might have been able to establish at a younger age. 
It is a privilege, though, to have a certain adaptability that others lacking the situational experience might have trouble matching. Or having the mind of a world-traveled soul, when so many would wish nothing better than to leave the one place they have always known. 
I am aware that in this wayward and unorthodox life experience of mine, there has been undeniable benefit in having been allowed to exist going among teams rather than always staying true to one prescribed. And yet, there comes a time when that stability of the one who’s never doubted where they are from or who they are becomes so desirable that the wanderer begins to look about themselves wondering where they might lay roots. 
Looking back on it now, many of those sentiments were present in my mind when I finally decided on Southern California as the place where I would settle down for four full years. Having spent the previous four years in three different countries and two different continents, four years in one place seemed like an eternity. 
So coming to this entirely foreign place already felt like a homecoming, and with it came my quiet hopes and aspirations and anxieties of finding home and settling down, if only for a moment. To work on laying some sturdy foundations and to build the next layer of my growth as an individual upon their stability, the port from which to launch into my next adventure.
And yet, now that I am here, I feel a certain trepidation to trust myself and lay down those roots. Having taken on an identity akin to that of the nomads of the Sahara for so long, it can be daunting to now trust a footprint will actually stick, and not be wiped clean from the sand by the ever changing desert winds. 
But that is the only solution, to trust. The wind will inevitably continue to blow — sometimes devastatingly so. But don’t be afraid to settle. Trust your ability to adapt when you must, and when you mustn’t, your ability to stand strong; and through it all, your ability to grow.

The term “self-partnered,” made buzzworthy by celebrities such as Emma Watson and Lizzo, has recently blown up online. Instead of calling herself “single,” Watson, acclaimed actor and activist, says her use of “self-partnered” has more to do with individual independence and self-fulfillment than with whether or not she has a long-term partner.
For college students, dating and relationships may be incredibly varied. Many students date, some take on long-term relationships and others remain single. Perhaps like Lizzo’s song “Soulmate” suggests, there should be more acceptance in being your own soulmate and more emphasis placed on the joy in building a life by yourself, which holds as much merit as doing it with someone else. 
One of the biggest misconceptions is that single people are more unhappy than those in relationships. Far from being miserable, anti-social or cynical, research shows that not only are singles becoming the fastest growing demographic in the U.S., they are also just as happy as those who are married or in committed relationships. In fact, they may even be happier. Single people have more personal control over their schedules, free time and ability to explore personal interests. Whereas exercise, seeing friends and spending time alone are often pushed aside in relationships. 
For college students, leisure time is already a precious rarity. Adding a relationship can result in added pressure and less time figuring out what is best for you and you alone. Being on your own also allows you to focus on developing personal and professional goals, which is a key aspect of the college experience. 
Another misconception is that being single means sacrificing connections altogether. Just because you may not be  in a serious relationship doesn’t mean you are neglecting to spend time with friends and family or forging new acquaintances. Being “self-partnered” equates to self-sufficiency but not necessarily being physically alone all the time. Regardless of relationship status, personal support systems are invaluable. In the high-intensity atmosphere of college, this is even more so. 
Of course, some may be eager to jump into the world of relationships in college. Popular dating apps are heavily marketed toward college students and recent graduates, as they are the most likely groups to use them. The number of users has nearly tripled in the last few years, as reported by a 2016 Pew Research Study that found that 27% of people age 18-24 have used dating apps. A booming market means the development of specialty apps that appeal to specific groups. 
For instance, Friendsy searches only for other college students, while HER tailors to queer and non-binary individuals. Students can control their level of involvement; whether you are seeking a more casual fling or a serious connection, there are plenty of options. 
Whether or not you’re seeking romantic relationships, college remains a wonderful place to meet as many people as possible. It’s an opportunity to find groups you relate to who with whom you share interests and values. You can personalize your search for friends much like you would on a dating app. Although meeting new people in college is overwhelming, USC holds many events every day that draw a huge range of students, from free recreational sporting activities to movie screenings, to wellness and relaxation events and trips around the Los Angeles area.
And if you are single and looking to make a connection, having a plethora of social avenues to explore is even more beneficial. The key is deciding what is right for you. 
There’s absolutely no harm in using dating apps and jumping into a thriving college dating scene, but there’s also nothing wrong with focusing on yourself. Sometimes, proclaiming to be “self-partnered” is a much-needed reminder that you are enough.

Investment firm executive Douglas Hodge filed a motion in federal court Thursday announcing his intention to request that his Operation Varsity Blues sentence be rescinded, stating that the government failed to release sufficient evidence to his defense before the sentencing.
Hodge received the longest sentence and the largest fine in the college admissions case to date at his hearing last month. He will serve nine months in prison, two years of supervised release and 500 hours of community service and pay a fine of $750,000 for securing his children’s admission to USC and Georgetown University as fake athletic recruits. 
In the motion filed Thursday, Hodge claimed he believed his payments would fund university athletics departments rather than be used to bribe coaches. He cited documents the government released last week to parents involved in the admissions scandal, including a note from scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer’s iPhone that he wrote following a phone call with FBI investigators. 
In the note, Singer stated that he deliberately misled parents to believe the money they paid for their children’s admissions would fund legitimate donations to university programs. The note stated that federal investigators had asked him to testify that the parents knew their payments would be used as bribes.
“They continue to ask me to tell a fib and not restate what I told my clients as to where there money was going — to the program not the coach and that it was a donation and they want it to be a payment,” the note read.
Hodge requested a 30-day extension on the March 11 deadline to file an appeal, saying the prosecution did not release all relevant evidence in time for him to form an argument that may have merited a lower sentence.
“The recently disclosed exculpatory information … supports Mr. Hodge’s contention that he made payments with the expectation that his money would support university athletic programs,” the document read. “The government’s inappropriate withholding of that information deprived the Court of its ability to evaluate Mr. Hodge’s argument based on all available information.”
Hodge worked with Singer to arrange for his children’s admission to USC beginning in 2012. Singer solicited the help of women’s soccer coach Ali Khosroshahin to create a soccer recruitment profile for Hodge’s daughter featuring falsified awards and positions that senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel presented to an admissions subcommittee. The process was repeated in 2015 with Hodge’s son, who Heinel tagged as a football recruit despite the student not playing football after his freshman year of high school, according to court documents. Both children received offers of admission but did not play their respective sports when they enrolled at USC.
Hodge pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering in October for paying $850,000 to have four of his children falsely designated as athletic recruits on their college applications. Two were admitted to USC and two to Georgetown University. He was also accused of conspiring with Singer to arrange for his fifth child’s admission to Loyola Marymount University. He plans to turn himself in March 20 to begin his prison sentence, according to court documents.

On an average day at Kingsley Manor Retirement Community, students hang out in the dining room, casually conversing with their senior neighbors about their favorite shows and teaching them how to use phones.  
These students are part of the Davis School of Gerontology’s intergenerational program, which offers gerontology students the opportunity to live with seniors with free room and board to develop practical experience getting along with senior citizens. The Davis school has been collaborating with Kingsley Manor Retirement Community since 1984.
“[Students] understand firsthand the challenges and the rewards of working in that environment, and they understand the needs of those older adults,” said Maria Henke, senior associate dean of the Davis School. “They get to see what the day-to-day lives of older people living in a senior community are like.”
Kingsley Manor Retirement Community currently houses more than 200 residents, who enjoy life after retirement or receive nursing care. Students volunteer 16 hours per week to organize community activities such as TED Talk discussions and socialize with seniors, according to Shaun Rushforth, the executive director at Kingsley Manor Retirement Community.
“The really unique part about the program is that they actually live here, so they become not just a volunteer here but a neighbor to our residents,” Rushforth said. 
Nelson Rubio, a graduate student studying aging services management, has been living at Kingsley Manor Home since January 2019. He said he often holds social activities based on residents’ interests. Recently, residents have been interested in virtual reality.  
“We are testing virtual reality, which is actually really popular among older adults in our dementia group,” Rubio said. “It’s hard for them to go out in the community often, so it’s a really great tool for them to experience other places.”
Students get to know the residents through daily informal interactions to create a comforting environment for them, Rubio said. Students eat meals with residents in the dining room, he added. 
“Sometimes part of the hours is visiting the resident in their room and having a conversation regarding their favorite show [and] listening to music with them,” Rubio said. “Sometimes I have residents teaching me how to play the piano.” 
Rubio said he always turns his phone on in case residents call him for help with technology. He has also served as a “matchmaker,” connecting senior residents with friends of his who share common interests.
“I ask what their interests are, and I would find somebody who’s interested in the same things,” Rubio said. “They accommodate and they develop those friendships and it’s easy for them that way.”
Since a lot of senior residents spend most of their day inside, Rubio said he often acts as the residents’ “eyes” by talking with them about what’s happening outside the community. 
“We keep them informed of the outside world, which is actually nice because we’re changing a little bit of their routine,” Rubio said.  “These are the opportunities to see something different [happening] today.”
Through daily interaction, Rubio has developed friendships with senior residents. He recounted feeling uneasy when one of the residents, who used to co-teach a class with him, didn’t show up for class. He later learned he had passed away that  morning.      
“You develop friendships that sometimes end too soon,” Rubio said. “That makes you appreciate those moments and it makes you think that while they’re here, how can you make their life better?”
Rubio said he has learned a lot about the importance of being sensitive to senior adults’ difficulties and thinking innovatively to help them overcome these challenges.
“Not everybody has the same needs,” Rubio said. “In order to meet everyone’s needs, you [have to] find creative ways to meet those needs … In order to be successful in this field, you have … to be sensitive and understand the challenges the older adults face as they age.”
Rushforth said residents enjoy chatting with students to gain knowledge of their perspectives on social issues and learning from students about how to use technologies, such as immersive technology. 
“The residents appreciate [students’] perspective in conversations and current events,” Rushforth said. “Technology is a big thing that our residents will go to our student volunteers [for, since] they have time and talents in that.”
George Shannon, instructional associate professor at the Davis school, said intergenerational programs satisfy both senior citizens’ need to share experience and students’ need to understand their behaviors.
“It puts together older adults with young kids and fosters understanding and growth on both ends,” Shannon said. “The older adults have this need to communicate and the kids have a need to understand what it is that they’re witnessing in terms of aging.”
Students interested in the program submit their resumes and cover letters to Rushforth, who meets with students to talk about expectations of the program and make sure they are a good fit, Rushforth said.
“We’re looking for students who are going to be here on the long term for a while,” Rushforth said. “They get to know our residents, our residents get to know them.”
Rushforth said every student’s experience in the program has been different, depending on the activities they have organized and the relationships they have formed with senior residents.
“When you pull students who already have that affinity for this demographic and population, there’s genuine affection and friendship that occurs because of that,” Rushforth said. “It is a program where the students can make of it what they want to a certain degree. There’s no two experiences that are the same.”

In alignment with her plans to make USC a sustainable campus, President Carol Folt announced the Presidential Sustainability Working Group in early February, a task force focused on creating recommendations for a more sustainable campus through education, research and operations.
In the campus-wide email, Folt said the task force was a University-wide approach to campus sustainability by surveying students and faculty on how they can improve the University’s sustainability efforts. 
“Our responsibility is to … think through the kind of institutional changes that are needed to facilitate, to engage, to make it a more viable, sustainable University and recommend things that therefore should be changed or modified in order to accomplish sustainability,” chair of the group and Price School of Public Policy professor Daniel Mazmanian said.
The task force was created by the Academic Senate in September after Folt’s request to include community recommendations to sustainability efforts. Members include faculty, staff and students from eight schools such as the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, the Marshall School of Business and the Rossier School of Education. They have since made recommendations to USC about implementing more education about sustainability, more administrative oversight and adhering to the University’s Sustainability 2028 plans, which will include long-term sustainability goals in energy, water, waste diversion and transportation.
The group suggested that USC require all freshmen or students in their first two semesters to take introductory-level sustainability courses focused on educating students about the implications of not addressing climate change, Mazmanian said. The advisory board also recommended that USC create options within each school to offer majors and minors focused on environmentally friendly coursework and be identified as “USC Sustainability Schools” that will help prospective students to identify which schools offer sustainability curriculums.  
“The challenge in these introductory courses by school and discipline, are the existential threat as viewed through the lens of your school and discipline,” Mazmanian said. “In the Price school [it would] be a policy lens. And then you might go over to psychology and it’s a behavioral change lens … all of them triggered by this realization that things are changing dramatically because of the existential [climate] threat.”
The group also advised that the University implement an experiential learning sustainability course to provide a more hands-on experience to sustainability education through activities such as research, field-based and service focused projects.
“The belief of everyone on the committee … was that from a pedagogical point of view, having an actual experience in a community, in an area, with an activity of research that is really about the existential threat, small groups,” Mazmanian said. “Experiential learning activity is a very important way of communicating that there’s a future. There is a problem, but there is a future because people are working on it.”
The task force has also recommended that USC add a chief sustainability officer as a senior-level appointment. Chair of the Urban Planning and Spatial Analysis Department Marlon Boarnet, a member of the task force, said it is crucial for the University to appoint a chief sustainability officer to more efficiently bring student recommendations on sustainability initiatives to administration and the advisory group.
“We did feel that it was important that there be a chief sustainability officer for the University, partly to facilitate some of this cross-talk within the University, partly to signal to a lot of our partners and potential partners outside of the University [of] the University’s commitment,” Boarnet said.
The group is currently in the process of making recommendations to the developing 2028 Sustainability Plan regarding waste diversion, expanding the University’s recycling programs and reducing its carbon emissions, Mazmanian said. The task force suggests USC divert waste and grow the recycle program and reduce USC’s carbon emissions.
“We are charged with thinking boldly about how the University needs to change to become sustainable,” Mazmanian said. “How to help make sure that the University itself is operating sustainability, as in reducing its greenhouse gas impacts, reducing its carbon footprint, moving toward zero waste, being more efficient at how we use our materials … but these are recommendations.”
The advisory board also includes student representatives Nathaniel Hyman, co-executive director of the Environmental Student Assembly, and Tianna Shaw-Wakeman, a representative of Environmental Core, alongside 19 faculty members including Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism professor Christina Bellantoni and Project Specialist for the Office of the President Nicholas Hudson.
Shaw-Wakeman, a senior majoring in psychology and social entrepreneurship, said the presence of student representatives on the committee allows the group to directly address student concerns about sustainability, emphasizing that conversations about sustainability need to be made accessible to students. 
“[My goal is] to make sure that I am acting as some type of vessel for the student body so that when I am making [suggestions to Folt], I’m thinking about my experiences with undergraduate and graduate students,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “I do think if policies are going to affect students, they should be at least informed [of them].”
Mazmanian said the group will keep working toward making the campus more sustainable as long as they are needed and plans to continue in the upcoming fall semester.  
“We’re going to be in existence as long as they continue to come forward, that someone brings [a suggestion] to the president [and] the president says, ‘Would you please look at this deeply for us?’” Mazmanian said. “We’ll see what those are going to be. I just want to mention this is not just the ending in April or May rather, that the expectation is that we’re going to be in business next year also.”
