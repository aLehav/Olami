The roller coaster of election ups and downs this week coupled with the looming end of the fall semester has made it difficult for anyone, myself included, to stay focused on any one task at hand. With so much else going on, my last column of the semester about (surprise!) nonprofits may feel out of place or random. However, nonprofits relate critically to the current political climate. 
By reimagining and reforming structures, such as philanthropy and nonprofits, we have the potential to largely impact communities. I want to draw attention to practices that aren’t working or benefitting people as well as they should, which leads me to the problematic role Donor Advised Funds play in the nonprofit sector. 
DAFs are becoming an increasingly popular way for Americans to set aside billions of dollars for supposedly charitable use. A person simply deposits cash, or an asset including stocks or real estate, in the brokerage account of a commercial national charity, such as Fidelity Charitable. This donation does not require a capital gains tax and the donor receives an immediate tax deduction equivalent to the amount donated. The commercial national charity then invests the asset and gives money to the charity of the donators’ choosing. 
At face value, DAFs are an effective vehicle to get more money into charities. The catch? DAFs have no deadline or requirement to donate the money they receive, leading to the stagnation of billions of dollars in brokerage accounts. 
Donors’ initial incentive to put their assets into a DAF is the avoidance of a capital gains tax and the immediate tax deduction they receive equal to the amount donated. After this initial financial incentive, however, there is no motivation for donors to ensure charities actually receive the assets. As a result, in 2017, assets to DAFs totaled $85.15 billion, with DAFs only donating $15.75 billion. A study by the Congressional Research office found that 25% of companies with DAFs made no charitable donations. 
While initial donors ultimately decide when to donate their money to charity, there is incentive for commercial national charities like Fidelity Charitable to keep the money in DAFs as long as possible. Financial firms take management fees off of the amount of assets in DAFs. Therefore, the longer assets just sit in DAFs, the bigger the pay off for the firms. 
The set up of DAFs provides tax loopholes for billionaires at the expense of nonprofits that desperately need funding. For example, the net worth of Nicholas Woodman, the CEO of GoPro, shot up to around $3 billion once his company’s stock went public in 2014. Immediately, Woodman put $500 million worth of GoPro stock (about $95 per share) into the Silicon Valley Community Foundation — saving him tens of millions of dollars. In 2018, GoPro’s stocks plummeted to less than $6 a share with no trace of the Woodman Foundation or the $500 million initially donated. 
Knowing his tax bill would rise significantly in 2014, Woodman strategically donated to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in order to take a tax deduction and avoid capital gains on stocks that eventually lost value. This move likely reduced his personal tax bill for years, with no benefits to the nonprofits the financial firm claims to help. 
To remedy these issues, Congress should mandate that commercial national charities provide evidence in tax returns that measure its impact with donations to nonprofits. Additionally, the requirement to distribute donations within a fixed number of years would ensure money leaves DAFs and goes to nonprofits. Lastly, if management fees were capped, financial firms would lose incentive to keep money sitting in DAFs. 
As a result of a flawed system, billions of dollars sit in DAFs for years at a time, directly helping the wealthy while keeping money from communities and charities that need it most. Outside of DAFs exist a multitude of issues in nonprofits and philanthropy that lack mainstream awareness and advocacy. The first step to change is identification of the problem. Hopefully, my column this semester has brought to light issues you hadn’t thought about before and shown that, with the right reforms, the nonprofit sector and philanthropy as a whole has the potential to do immense good.

Wow. 
If that’s how this season’s gonna go, USC fans might be wise to just turn the TV off each week and check the score when the game is over. 
I jest, of course — but only slightly. The No. 20 Trojans’ victory over Arizona State Saturday was about the wildest USC game I’ve ever seen (I’m a junior with no prior USC ties; please go easy). It was thrilling, it was nerve-wracking, it was infuriating, it was exhilarating, it was an emotional roller coaster with hundred-foot drops every three seconds and corkscrews placed at irregular intervals throughout. 
It was everything USC fans feared this game might be, minus what matters above all: the ultimate victor.
But don’t let USC’s undefeated record trick you. It was a horrid performance. I’m hardly sold.
The coaching was questionable at best. The defensive game plan was ineffective. (Side note: Was there a defensive game plan?) The offense decided that 9 a.m. in a drizzle was the perfect scenery for a game of hot potato, substitute football for starch. 
But hey, they won, and I’m a positive guy. Let’s talk about something good: Kedon Slovis.
Alright, I misled you. I have to lead this off with some negativity; it’s essential to my point. The sophomore quarterback did not play a particularly clean game. He was good, sure. He was not amazing. His was the kind of stat sheet that would fool someone who didn’t watch the game, namely, a non-USC or ASU fan who decided it wasn’t particularly worth it to arise basically at the crack of dawn (I’m a college student) to catch the 9 a.m. kickoff. (Seriously, Larry Scott, East Coasters can watch games at 4 p.m. eastern time.)
Slovis forced way too many passes into double- and triple-coverage in Week 1, and though an offensive line porous in pass protection prevented him from getting comfortable until late, his decision-making was nonetheless uncharacteristic. The would-be interception that went right off the hands of ASU redshirt junior linebacker Kyle Soelle and into those of sophomore receiver Drake London stands out. As does his actual interception in the second quarter, thrown into literally triple coverage. As do several other dangerous balls that, thankfully for USC, fell to the ground. As well, there were several balls that Slovis simply under or over threw.
It was clear Slovis didn’t have his A-game, and it’s clear that Heisman Slovis is a pipe dream if he doesn’t clean that up. 
He will. 
How do I know? 
We got a sneak peek at Heisman Slovis in the last few minutes as USC pulled off the most improbable of improbabilities, because what separates good quarterbacks from great ones is that the latter finds a way to get the job done when they’re not firing on all cylinders. 
That’s what Slovis did in the final minutes Saturday. He was an entirely different quarterback, one who stared down the face of a 13-point deficit with time winding down and USC’s Pac-12 Championship hopes evaporating before noon of Week 1, facing do-or-die fourth-and-long multiple times with backs pressed as tightly against the wall as physically possible, and he delivered.
I’m talking about the absolutely perfect pass he delivered to London for the go-ahead score, a ball that seasoned NFL quarterbacks couldn’t have placed any better. I’m talking about the presence of mind to heave it up to junior receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown in the end zone on fourth-and-9 down 13, knowing USC had a free play after an ASU offside penalty, in hopes of a lucky bounce — which he got. I’m talking about the strike to St. Brown across the middle for 36 yards to put USC just outside the red zone, setting up that first touchdown.
Slovis in those two drives was 8-for-12 with 114 yards and two touchdowns. Anything less than that, and USC is 0-1. In a game where the sophomore played well but not quite up to his standard, he managed to get the job done in the biggest moments, a marker of elite maturity and poise. 
Of course, the story of USC’s comeback can’t be told without mentioning several other contributors: redshirt freshman receiver Bru McCoy, who found himself in the right place at the right time on that first touchdown and scooped up the ensuing onside kick; freshman kicker Parker Lewis, the author of said kick that gave USC the chance to tie it up in the first place; redshirt senior running back Vavae Malepeai, who ran for 33 yards combined on the first two plays of the deciding drive to set up the go ahead score; St. Brown, who picked up the aforementioned 36-yard reception and showed awareness of his own in tipping the first touchdown to McCoy. 
The story of the other 55 minutes can’t be told without junior safety Talanoa Hufanga’s 10 tackles and forced fumble, St. Brown’s 100 receiving yards, the four turnovers and yes, head coach Clay Helton taking the much-needed risk-taking on fourth down a bit too far with a failed attempt in the third quarter when USC desperately needed to draw within one possession. 
Neither of those stories — the comeback or the game at large — can be told without London, who led USC with 125 receiving yards and hung on for a somersaulting, fingertip-strength-testing, double-covered, supremely athletic grab on the dime from Slovis that won it. 
I could’ve written about London, in my mind, the clear-cut MVP of that win. (I did it once, go read my profile.) But frankly, London didn’t surprise me one bit. 
Slovis surprised me. I thought he was going to be elite all game Saturday, and he wasn’t. To be honest, I’m not quite sure what to make of his performance.
Ah, heck. I won’t try to make anything of it. I’ll take it for what it was: a fine showing followed by a four-minute stretch in which Kedon Slovis showed everyone how a great quarterback simply finds a way to get the job done, no matter the circumstances.

The NBA and the music industry are in the same boat, and they’re both sinking. 
The NBA and commissioner Adam Silver find themselves treading water as they face life-or-death decisions. Last week the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association made one of those life-or-death decisions, announcing the league will have the shortest offseason in professional sports history and play 72 games in an attempt to stay afloat until the 2021-22 season. 
The music industry is also at the back of its boat, submerged in water. The industry has been sinking for a while now, but the coronavirus pandemic has it gasping for what may be its last breaths. The main players of the industry — artists, digital streaming platforms and labels — are currently underwater, fighting for a nonexistent life jacket.
The underwater fight is as sad as it sounds. Last week, in response to a petition calling to pay artists a penny per stream, DSP powerhouse Spotify responded to criticism with an offer to pay artists even less. 
Yes, you read that right. Spotify announced a plan that would offer artists algorithmic promotional boosts on songs in exchange for paying the artist a lesser royalty rate on said song. In other words, the company offered exposure in exchange for no pay, not to be mistaken for the equally exploitative practice of experience in exchange for no pay. As villainous as Spotify may sound, remember it’s fighting for air, too. 
Spotify is the perfect example to contextualize the currently struggling music industry. A company with over 320 million users and 144 million paid subscribers can’t afford to pay artists even half a penny per stream. Since its launch in 2008, Spotify has never posted a net profit, nor has it had consecutive profitable quarters. This is mainly because whenever Spotify’s revenue increases, the Big Three of music — Sony, Universal and Warner — demand that their royalty percentage increases as well. 
For example, in 2019, Spotify’s year-over-year revenue increased by 26% only for royalty rates to increase by 30%. Since Spotify doesn’t have any musical artists of its own, the company’s existence relies on the Big Three to supply content.
 Now, this may make the Big Three sound like the villains, and to an extent they are, but they’re victims of circumstance just as much as the artists and DSPs.
To make a long column less long, I’ll use one word to explain how labels went from Infinity War Thanos to the half-dead Endgame Thanos: Napster. 
Napster killed the concept of physical sales and made data more transparent for artists and empowered listeners. The high profit margins of CDs were gone, artists learned their true value and fans felt entitled to either free music or music at a fraction of what they paid in the past. The industry went from pulling in $25 billion in revenue in 1999 to $14.2 billion in 2014. Then, right when the industry seemed destined for air in 2020, as revenue grew for a fifth straight year in 2019 and eclipsed $20 billion for the first time since 2005, a pandemic happened, tours stopped and streaming revenue went from a fraction to the main source of income for artists. Instead of 2020 solidifying a new era of digital success in the music industry, the year has shown that the industry is as far from financial stability as ever.
The pandemic and a $200 million tweet from Daryl Morey are the only reasons the NBA finds itself in the same boat as the music industry. Before the 2019-20 season, the NBA’s revenue increased every non-lockout season for 20 years to a point where the league’s annual revenue from the 2018-19 season was almost four times as much as from the 2001-02 season. A league as innovative as the NBA doesn’t deserve to be in the same boat as the music industry, but here we are. 
The NBA’s revenue dropped 10% last season, approximately $1.5 billion, and next season is projected to be up to four times as bad. Silver reportedly told players, “this could be the single greatest challenge of all our lives.” While that does sound overly dramatic, take into account that fan attendance accounts for approximately 40% of the league’s revenue, and the NBA travels more than any professional league in the United States. Explained simply, basketball is a sport that has to take in some percentage of fans to avoid financial drowning. 
These simple facts combined with a pandemic and a historically short offseason make the NBA seem close to joining the music industry underwater, but I don’t think so.
Between artists demanding their worth, streaming platforms existing at the allowance of labels and said labels bullying all those involved to pursue the heights of yesteryears, the music industry seems destined to drown from each branch pulling the other down. Each party knows they can’t survive without assistance from the others, yet each side wants to reap more than the other. The reason the music industry may never be the same post-pandemic while the NBA will likely return to growth in a year is because those involved in the success of the NBA are willing to sacrifice.
The NBPA would be well within its rights to fight the NBA on a shortened offseason, just as team owners could understandably request pay cuts and TV stations could justifiably push for an 82-game season. But then, everyone would lose. Instead, each party is accepting a balanced amount of sacrifice in order to stay afloat and one day return to smooth sailing. Meanwhile, the music industry can’t even find a way to split a penny.

As the fall semester draws to a close, USC’s plan for the spring semester remains up in the air. In October, President Carol Folt announced in a video message to students that the University is hoping to offer in person and hybrid classes and welcome 5,000 students back to campus in the spring. However, these plans are contingent on clearance from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which USC failed to receive in the fall.
With coronavirus cases still on the rise and stay-at-home orders still in place in Los Angeles, it is not unlikely that classes will remain online in the spring semester. Under these circumstances, USC will need to continue to ensure that it can enable academic success despite remote learning challenges and provide support to students who may be struggling with mental health.
USC announced that amendments to the spring semester schedule this year would include the cancellation of spring break — which is typically one week long — in an attempt to minimize the spread of the virus due to travel. While this is not a bad idea and the University should be commended for its active efforts to contain the spread of the virus, it creates novel mental health challenges for students. 
The lack of a fall break this semester was somewhat made up for by the fact that the semester was condensed to 13 weeks, though this posed other problems for professors and students who had to adjust to a faster-paced schedule. However, the spring semester is a more typical 15 weeks. Though the University has proposed a personal wellness day program that will provide a series of days off during the semester, it has yet to disclose additional details. 
The extended winter break, which is almost two months long this year, is a welcome rest from spending upwards of eight hours a day on the computer attending Zoom classes, club meetings and remote work. Zoom fatigue is real, and the University will need to ensure that students are not burnt out during the spring semester.
Students should also be able to continue to elect the pass/no-pass grading option through the spring semester. As the petition urging the administration to offer pass/no-pass in the fall stated, “classes have not gotten any easier but the state of the world is much, much harder than it was at the beginning of this year.” It does not make sense to hold students to the same standard as when they had access to every resource that the University usually provides.
In addition, the deadline to elect this option should be after finals, like it was in Spring 2020. Online learning has not become much easier this year, and it would alleviate some of the stress students may experience due to the remote format if the University implemented a grading system that was more accommodating.
Part of the stress of the fall semester came with the University’s last-minute communication to students regarding class plans and housing. It took until July 1 — after many students’ lease deadlines for off-campus housing had already passed — for the University to announce that classes would be primarily online. Then, on Aug. 5 — less than two weeks before classes began — the University announced that the fall semester would take place fully online. 
There is little point in being blindly optimistic about the spring semester. While a wait period is understandable considering USC is waiting on a decision from L.A. County itself, students do not want to have their hopes up for a return to campus only to be disappointed. They were inconvenienced, more than anything, by the University’s late announcements this semester; some students were locked into off-campus housing contracts and others had to deal with flight and on-campus housing cancellations.
In order to address this, the University must be fully transparent about spring semester housing and classes. In addition, it should make an effort to relay its decision to students as soon as possible and well before any off-campus housing deadlines.
As of now, it is still unclear when the pandemic will end and life will return to “normal.” The results of the 2020 election indicate that the government will be making changes to its current direction in the fight against the virus, although it is not immediately clear exactly how or to what extent. The best thing USC can do for its students during this time of uncertainty is to ensure that it, at least, is clear in its direction during the pandemic.

When I chose “All the World’s a Screen” as a title two years ago for this column, I in no way expected that the play on Shakespeare’s famous metaphor would be a statement of fact. In 2020, all the world is a screen — that is, we see all the world through screens, and this has consequences on how we think about it. Call it ironic, but this, my final column for the Daily Trojan, is about how all the world is assuredly not a screen. Thankfully.
In the few years I’ve been writing this column, I see personal growth reflected in the interests I’ve expressed here. At first, I was focused solely on discussing popular films and Oscar picks. Then I began writing about individual films, current directors, the rise of streaming and eventually how our viewing habits are being shaped by the mediums we use to watch films. Now, my column’s title has taken on a new meaning — a “screen” I take more literally now. How is the world shaped by screens? I have to admit that this interest is premature, though. Forced to slow down by the pandemic, I stopped going to the movies and had more time to read about them. I read a smattering of film theory and cultural criticism, and eventually I met media critic Neil Postman. 
Those who have read Postman will probably roll their eyes at this point, “I know where this is going.” You might be expecting me to get all pessimistic at this point, for Postman was criticized for being far too critical of technology. His most popular argument was that a technological medium is never neutral, it has a certain way of viewing the world which it teaches us the more we use it. Ending his career at the cusp of the Internet age, television was his primary target. “Amusing Ourselves to Death,” his most famous work, discussed how television has turned politics, religion and education into mere forms of entertainment. 
Postman is praised as a prophet but derided by many as a backward-thinking Luddite (one who hates and destroys all forms of technology). But he showed up at the right time for me. Precisely in the year when technology is most necessary, I found it refreshing to read someone with such a different attitude toward media. Fascinating as his arguments are, however, I’m slowly coming to terms with how potentially irrelevant those ideas are in a society brimming with technology and developing new devices and programs at such an alarming (frightening?) rate. But, I retain some hope. I think if any generation will be open to having a critical eye to media it will be mine: we who have a brief memory of a world without pervasive media, but have logged on for something like 17 years straight, may be the most open to disconnect — but not literally, of course. 
It would be very naive to say we need to stop seeing all the world through a screen by simply quitting social media and going all “Into the Wild.” I could argue that most of us don’t actually need to spend a lot of time online, but that would be equally futile. I’d rather argue the obvious first: The world is more than what we see on our screens. More importantly, people are more than what we see on our screens. More than simply looking up from our phones, I think we have to think differently while we’re using them. To understand that what we’re seeing isn’t everything; that “what’s happening” is more than a headline or trend; that our neighbors, friends and fellow citizens are more complex than a post or tweet. 
If we train ourselves to think this way whenever we’re online, we will resist the subtle ways technology can change our attitudes toward culture. 
This column began as film criticism, hoping to model a kind of unpretentious and fun way of reading movies; now I conclude by expanding that critical attitude to every part of life. I don’t think this is much of a jump anyway, for movies purport to distill life on the screen. A successful or “realistic” movie is one that reflects what the audience knows to be true about the world. So, in writing that we should hold on to what is true and complex (which is not necessarily everything we see through media), I believe we can hold our films accountable.

Self-proclaimed tinkerer and Iovine and Young student Jennifer Ellis first started her toy making journey while working at the Innovation Lab at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. After noticing the different ways students around her used technology to create interesting gadgets, she wanted her four-year-old daughter to learn more about science, math and technology while she played. 
However, having a difficult time finding age appropriate products that focused on educating young children, Ellis decided to create her first toy project, Giggle Chips.
The computer science flash card game uses STEM-related terms to help children recognize key concepts at an early age to turn their attention to the field. The card set also has multiple levels of play including alphabets, color matching, numbers and binary number matching and shapes to introduce children to STEM subjects at an age appropriate level and to ensure better understanding of science and math concepts in their future. 
The popularity of Giggle Chips led Ellis and her daughter to be invited on the ABC show “Toy Box” and put her in touch with the National Science Foundation. Ellis was also selected as one of 20 women in the United States for the Google Women Techmakers in Computer Science Scholars Program in 2020, where she won a $10,000 scholarship.
Ellis started working on her next toy project, Chiquitos, which means “little ones,” after noticing the lack of products representing her Latinx culture.
“[I realized] by trying and sharing your message about issues … you have in the world, that people will listen,” Ellis said. “So Giggle Chips got me to a certain level of success, but then I also realized that I have to pivot. And that’s why I’m working with Chiquitos to serve the Hispanic community through storytelling with games and toys.”
Chiquitos will include various games related to STEM subjects and Latinx culture. Their first game, Makey Shakey Molcajete, is a coding game that teaches children five years and older about building an algorithm through a salsa recipe. Ellis feels the board game format will help children learn alongside their family and friends in a team environment. 
“The thing that I care most about is just making sure that little kids have access to STEM education and I feel like when you make it fun and simple for kids, and especially for their families,” Ellis said, “it’s a good entry way to learn about STEM.”
Alongside her personal projects, Ellis also started Toy and Game Inventors at USC, a campus organization that helps students who are building physical toy models find resources, including inventor mentors and contacts within the toy industry. The organization, started by Ellis and her two IYA peers Alyssa Goldberg and Bansini Doshi, looks to help students grow and flourish as toy inventors. 
“Our goal is to become a forum for students that are either interested in [toy design] as a hobby, but also for people that want professional development in that particular industry,” Doshi, the organization’s vice president, said. “We’re hoping to be a little bit of a family for people that are interested in toys and games.”
Ellis also recognized that one of the ways that they can embrace the gap between culture and toys is by holding events where children create their own toys that communicate their cultures and backgrounds. The organization is planning an upcoming virtual event which invites young children to use recycled materials and available resources to make their own toys related to a specific theme at home. One of the themes they plan on employing is culture and heritage.
“I realized with my toy inventor friends at USC that there’s a gap with talking about culture,” Ellis said. “So I think the biggest way that we could embrace it is also just having events where kids could also use games and toys as a medium, like a communication tool to share their stories about their culture.”
Goldberg and Doshi are also currently working on numerous projects related to toys about culture and STEM. They credit their passion and inspiration to Ellis, who they say has been a trailblazer in the industry and a mentor to them. 
“When I started talking to her, I learned so much about her and I learned all of this history that she has done in the game industry,” Goldberg said. “I was just totally fascinated by the things that she was working on. She’s always coming up with new ideas … I was just so impressed and in awe of her talent and her drive that I just couldn’t help but want to be a part of all of her things that she was working on.”

Following the release of her seventh book for The Crisanta Knight Series, Geanna Culbertson spoke with the Daily Trojan about her experiences as a former student at USC and how that translated into her writing skills, passions and ventures. 
The Crisanta Knight Series is empowering fantasy-genre books primarily read by middle-grade and young adults. The base concept of the series focuses on the children and siblings of famous fairy tale characters who live in a magical world called “Book,” where they train to be the main characters of future stories. Culbertson, who was a public relations major with a triple minor in marketing, cinematic arts and critical approaches to leadership, features strong heroine leads in her series. Having written her first three book manuscripts while she was still a student at USC, she has spent almost a decade working on The Crisanta Knight Series. In the last few years, Culbertson has balanced a full-time job as a digital marketing manager while also crafting fairy tales for the series in her spare time.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Daily Trojan: First off, I would like to congratulate you on your seventh book release. That must be so exciting. Can you speak to your experience writing The Crisanta Knight Series?
Geanna Culbertson: It’s been really exciting. I always knew very important plot points and twists that were going to happen, but uncovering extra details, new characters and new worlds along the way has been really fun. I think it’s a good sign when you’re writing, if you’re very excited, and you’re like, “Oh, my gosh, I can’t believe that just happened,” but you’re the one who made it happen. It’s been a lot of fun and taken me to a lot of places I never thought possible. I’ve toured about 10 states now with different book tours and speaking to conventions at elementary schools, libraries, like a huge range of people from a lot of places. It’s a really cool thing to see so many different parts of the country and get to know people from all different walks of life who connect with something you’ve created — that’s definitely been one of the more rewarding parts.
DT: OK, let’s backtrack a little. Can you tell me a little bit about your thesis at USC, “Beauty and the Badass” — “Origins of the Princess-Hero Archetype”?
GC: “Beauty and the Badass” — “Origins of the Princess-Hero Archetype” was something that had started to really draw my interest in sophomore year, when I started my book series. I was already writing about the characters in my series, the daughters and siblings and these fairy tale characters new and old. Something that’s always been really important to me that I’ve always loved growing up is superheroes and princesses. I felt like growing up, it was unusual to me that most of my favorite characters, literary heroes, etc., even cartoons, were boys. I was realizing maybe that, with a lot of girl-driven stories, it’s changing that for sure. Girl-driven stories really do focus more on like the romance and delicate aspects of femininity, whereas hero stories, where it’s a male main character, there’s a lot more character exploration going on in different areas of what makes a person a person. I was already by then really deep into my book series, and that was helping me develop my characters in my world. I spent like a couple of years trying to figure out a formula for what made a hero princess archetype tick in terms of vulnerabilities, strengths, tropes and just really analyzing what worked and what didn’t. I think that really helped in terms of my understanding of what I was writing and who I was writing for.
DT: What gave you that idea to begin The Crisanta Knight Series? How does that relate to your thesis?
GC: I took the most amazing class called “Classic and Contemporary Fairy Tales” with Aimee Bender. I was doing all that [fairy tale] research, reading all those books, and everything was starting to spark ideas inside of me. Then we had to do a final project for the class. I was really brainstorming, and I came up with this map of this world, and that ended up being the basis of all the kingdoms in my book series. Between that and the WRIT 340 class, I just had this great big idea that I needed to crack open and go for, so they just kind of started feeding into each other.
DT: The Crisanta Knight Series is full of strong and original heroines. What was your inspiration or influences when creating these characters? Was there anyone maybe you had in mind when you were creating them?
GC: I really wanted to write books where we care about the valiancy and vulnerability of the main character and her journey. It’s a lot of internal arc as much of an external arc because even now, if I go back and look at book one, two, etc., [Crisanta Knight is] such a different person, all of my main characters are than they were when they started. I’m a big fan of getting people to appreciate the value of change, and taking advantage of their potential and just striving to be more in life. That’s what I really wanted to put into my characters and the overall themes of my book. So creating these characters was as much about trying to discover the answers to the questions as it was trying to create something that someone like me and a lot of other girls, and people in general, would love. 
DT: Can you tell me a little bit about the plot your book follows? How do your characters progress throughout the series? 
GC: My main hero is the title protagonist, Crisanta Knight and she’s the daughter of Cinderella. She, along with other famous fairy tale descendants, goes to a school called Lady Agnue’s School for Princesses and Other Female Protagonists. I would say my five main characters are her [Crisanta Knight], the younger sister of Little Red Riding Hood, the daughter of Snow White, the younger brother of Jack from Jack and the Beanstalk, and also a character called Daniel, who is a new protagonist, because not all people who go to these schools have these relationships to fairy tales past. As this larger than life plot develops, it ties in a lot of worlds like our world, Earth, we also just go to a lot of other worlds where we deal with mystical characters, you know, King Arthur, the Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan, Toyland, Sleepy Hollow.
There’s a lot of great internal arcs and storytelling, because it’s a coming of age story. You have characters who start at 16, when the story begins, my time is over. They’re 18, and just really figuring out how to take fate into their own hands in this world. It’s really driven by traditional storytelling tropes and convention and just trying to define yourself.
DT: What would you say your writing style is?
GC: I read a review where someone said that my writing style was like a chocolate covered pretzel, so sweet and salty. And I like that, because it definitely does describe my style in a sense. I like to have really fun, sassy moments that make you giggle, but I also have moments where they’re very serious and deep. 
DT: Do you have a most memorable experience as a writer?
GC: One of my very first events, right after Book Three had come out, I got asked to do a presentation at a middle school in Florida for their Friends of the Library event, where the middle schools each picked one book to read and then have the author come to speak. They brought me down to the auditorium, and there’s about 600 kids in the audience all cheering. I gave my full speech on stage, and I did a reading and I took a Q&A. It was this larger than life experience. I sat there for a minute processing what just happened, but it really showed that people can like what you create and care that you’re there. I think that really impacted me because I’ve always been trying to live up to that amazing feeling where my books made people feel so excited.
Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled Lady Agnue’s School for Princesses and Other Female Protagonists. The Daily Trojan regrets the error
