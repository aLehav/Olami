Former Dean of the USC Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work Marilyn Louise Flynn and Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas were indicted on federal bribery charges that alleged Ridley-Thomas accepted bribes from Flynn “in the form of direct and indirect financial benefits” according to court documents released from the United States District Court for the Central District of California Wednesday. 
The federal charges come after a 2018 United States Attorney’s Office investigation into a large “donation” made between Ridley-Thomas and Flynn. 
In a 20-count indictment filed Wednesday, Ridley-Thomas and Flynn are accused of defrauding through wire communication and honest services. The documents allege the activity occurred between 2017 and 2018.
The activities between Flynn and Ridley-Thomas, who has a doctorate from USC in social ethics, were connected with Ridley-Thomas’ son, Sebastian Ridley-Thomas. According to the indictment, Ridley-Thomas conspired with Flynn to allow Sebastian to attend USC on a full-tuition scholarship. In January 2018, Sebastian enrolled to obtain his master’s degree from the school and served as a Professor of Practice of Policy and Social Work a month later.
The documents revealed that Sebastian received a full-tuition scholarship totaling $26,000 and a $50,000 salary from the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and the School of Public Policy during his time as a professor. The indictment also alleges Flynn set up an online curriculum that “had never existed” to accommodate Sebastian.
A $100,000 donation from Ridley-Thomas’ campaign committee was also allocated to the School of Social Work in Spring 2018. Flynn later transferred those funds to a think tank associated with United Ways of California, a non-profit organization run by Sebastian.
Court documents allege that the defendants took “steps to disguise, conceal, and cover up the bribes, kickbacks” including the $100,000 payment in which Ridley-Thomas penned a letter to the School of Social Work that provided false information to University officials about the funds’ purpose.
In exchange for bribes and kickbacks, Ridley-Thomas used his position on the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to present motions and agenda items that benefited the University, such as approving a motion to establish a partnership between the County and the School of Social Work.
Ridley-Thomas also supported contracts between the School of Social Work and various departments, including the L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services, to bring revenue into the school system.
According to a report from the Los Angeles Times, a USC staff member reported the transaction activity to the University Office of Compliance in June. Following the report, the University placed Flynn on leave and fired Sebastian from his faculty position.
The Court documents also note the timeline of events between Ridley-Thomas and Flynn that began in May 2017 when Ridley-Thomas informed Flynn of his son’s interest in obtaining a postgraduate degree. Their communication ended in July 2018 when Ridley-Thomas used his government position to approve a telehealth agreement between the University and the County.
The telehealth agreement occurred a few months after Flynn told a University official she would need to complete a “favor” to place the school in the Telehealth contract. This incident occurred in April 2018 when Flynn funneled University funds into Sebastian’s non-profit organization. 
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University said it has cooperated with the investigation and reiterated that Flynn no longer works at the School of Social Work.  
“When the university learned in the summer of 2018 about the $100,000 payment referenced in the indictment, the university disclosed the issue to the U.S. Attorney’s Office and has fully cooperated ever since,” the statement read. “Marilyn Flynn has not been employed by the University since September 2018.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Flynn’s lawyer Vicki Podberesky denied the federal charges.
“Marilyn Flynn has devoted her entire professional life to the field of social work. She has spent over 45 years in academia and has worked tirelessly for the improvement and betterment of the social welfare network in Los Angeles and around the country,” Podberesky wrote. “Ms. Flynn has not committed any crime and we believe that the evidence in this case will ultimately support this conclusion.”

USC has entered a “stable” period with the coronavirus as the weekly positivity rate continues its seven-week decline amid the approaching fall recess, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a USC Student Health briefing Tuesday.
Of the 32,369 tests administered last week, 26 students and three employees tested positive for the coronavirus. The student positivity rate decreased to 0.08% — the lowest reported rate of any period during the academic year since April 2020. In contrast, the positivity rate among faculty plateaued — standing steadily at 0.26%. 
“[The numbers] are continuing to look very strong, we don’t have any outbreaks — we’re continuing to see the people that are testing positive and having severe disease are increasingly the unvaccinated,” Van Orman said.
As coronavirus trends on campus stabilize, Van Orman urged students to take precautions during the upcoming fall recess, a “vulnerable” period when some students travel and engage in high-risk activities associated with the coronavirus. For those who decide to travel, Van Orman said students should receive a coronavirus test before and after. 
“We just want to remind people of the risk associated with travel, and particularly if you have traveled in a high risk environment or been in a part of the country where the community prevalence is higher [than Los Angeles], that you’re cautious when you get back and get tested on Monday or Tuesday,” Van Orman said. 
Van Orman also encouraged students to practice mitigation efforts to reduce the likelihood of transmission to family and friends with the approaching holiday season.  
“The most important thing is that, if you’re gathering in larger groups with people that you don’t know their vaccine status … is to gather outside,” Van Orman said. “For students who might be going home to visit vulnerable relatives … wear a mask indoors; it really does make a difference.” 
Van Orman said Student Health met with Los Angeles County Public Health officials last week and “does not anticipate any changes for their guidelines for the time being.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, a spokesperson for the L.A. County Public Health Department confirmed that suggestion, citing the county’s “substantial” rate of transmission for not amending guidelines that require everyone, regardless of vaccination status, to wear masks in indoor settings. 
“L.A. County does not have moderate transmission, and would need to have [moderate transmission] for a while to make sure we aren’t lifting a layer of protection too early,” the statement read. 
While USC’s vaccination rate holds steady at 95%, surrounding neighborhoods in South Central report lower vaccination rates compared to local and state averages. As of Oct. 7, 70.3% of residents around the University Park Campus received at least one dose of the vaccine, compared to the 66.2% of residents near Exposition Park with at least a single shot. 
Van Orman cited a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that demonstrates cases stemming from a university disproportionately affect broader coronavirus trends in the community. However, Van Orman highlighted the “important relationship” USC has with its community partners. 
Despite signs of decreasing delta variant cases, Van Orman said a “significant increase” of students seeking campus-sponsored mental health resources and counseling has strained campus mental wellness resources. 
“We’ve seen almost double the number of [first-appointment] intakes that we did in the Fall of 2019,” Van Orman said. “We are very busy; we are seeing a significant number of students and we do know that our data suggests that during the pandemic … College students in general saw significant increases in levels of depression, anxiety, as well as students who experienced significant losses during the pandemic, so we are seeing an increase in demand for services, and really significant numbers of students coming in.”
Van Orman expects the number of students who seek mental health resources to increase throughout the fall semester.
“We know that mental health needs among college campuses have been increasing dramatically for over 10 years now, and USC is no different than that,” Van Orman said. “So we are fortunate that we have many more resources than we did in the past, but we know there’s a lot of people who are in need and are reaching out for help.”

During the Undergraduate Student Government meeting Tuesday, senators discussed expanding language course options and providing support for a doctoral student who was recently involved in a dispute with the Los Angeles Police Department.
Accessibility committee chair Holly McCaulley first presented a progress report on several of her projects, including an initiative to provide hybrid courses for students and adding to the language options available for course credits.
The push for hybrid courses, managed by vice president Lucy Warren and senator Nivea Krishnan, aims to make class content available for students with disabilities or who contracted the coronavirus through recorded lectures and more options for virtual access. 
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, McCaulley said one of the issues with offering virtual classes is that teachers are accustomed to teaching Zoom classes due to the pandemic but struggle with the hybrid format. The project currently works to provide teachers with training to offer these classes, starting with faculty at the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences.
“The plan right now is to pilot a hybrid program with Dornsife, test out those surveys with student interest,” McCaulley said. 
The project is experiencing a transition due to Vice President of Student Affairs Winston Crisp’s leave of absence because of health-related issues, and those working on the project anticipate a new contact within administration, McCaulley said. 
McCaulley also presented Trojan Translate, an initiative to provide more options to offer foreign language courses, focusing on languages less popular but culturally relevant, such as American Sign Language. 
“We all think that these languages have the same significance as languages that are currently being offered,” McCaulley said. “In addition to widening the options for students, it’s really about keeping the culture and practice of these languages alive at such a big research university.”
Chief financial officer Adenike Makinde provided a progress report on the financing of recognized student organization projects. According to Makinde’s presentation, the funding department raised more than $17,400 for existing projects and awaits 40 more applications for Fall 2021 semester funding. The department’s staff increased from nine to 30, including funding delegates and additional assistant directors, Makinde said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Two new funds accompany the staff increase — the green engagement fund and the accessibility fund — designed to finance campus sustainability and student accessibility efforts, respectively.
“What we’re doing now is establishing the entire expectation of our oversight board for each of those funds,” Makinde said. “So we can figure out going forward, how we want to work with projects, how we want to allocate money and just the overarching parameters.” 
Warren also unveiled a collaboration with the Black Student Assembly to support Kayla Love, a postgraduate student studying chemistry who was involved in a dispute with the LAPD and USC Los Angeles County Medical Center.
According to NBC, Love was confronted by LAPD the night of June 27 after declining an overnight stay at the center following the birth of her child. The officers responded to a medical personnel’s request for a health and wellness check after Love’s departure, arriving with their weapons drawn at her dorm in the USC residential education housing.
“We had a very disheartening experience at USC Housing,” Warren said. “We want to promote her story and make sure everyone is aware of what’s going on.”
USG will publish a statement on the event from BSA soon, Warren said.

Prominent experts from around the country gathered on Zoom Tuesday for a panel discussion led by the Co-Directors of the Center for the Political Future about voting rights and the effect of state-by-state regulations on the election system.
The event, titled “Voting Rights and Voting Wrongs,” discussed questions such as “Why don’t we have higher voter participation?” and “Are we really at a point where we could lose the essential foundations of our democracy or the integrity of the voting system?”
The panel comprised of Linda Chavez, Chair of the Center for Equal Opportunity, Theodore Johnson, Fellows Program Director at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, Ralph Neas, member of the Senior Council on Voting Rights at the Century Foundation and Pete Peterson, senior fellow at the Davenport Institute for Public Engagement and Civil Leadership. 
CPF Co-Directors Robert Shrum and Michael Murphy moderated the discussion. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Shrum emphasized the importance of including differing political views when discussing voter rights, citing Democrat Ted Kennedy and Republican Bob Dole who worked together to extend the Voting Rights Act in 1982. 
“We’re trying to model and advance politics where we respect each other and we respect the truth, where even people who disagree with each other can have a civil discussion where we can look for solutions that a broad group of people can agree on,” Shrum said.
CPF hosts an orientation each semester where students and faculty propose topics that the center should cover. CPF Executive Director Kambiz Akhavan said voting rights were an overwhelming proposition. 
“[The] voting rights issue is something that seemed perfect for us to address prior to the midterm elections, and something that would have a very large audience interested in us exploring it,” said Akhavan in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Following former President Donald Trump’s lawsuits surrounding the validity of the 2020 election, a main topic of Tuesday’s conversation was voter fraud. At the beginning of the event, the panelists discussed the impact of absentee voting on voter fraud and the significance of the issue. Johnson said the issue of fraud itself is much less prominent than having inaccuracies within the election system. 
“I think there’s actually not that much real voter fraud that takes place, but there are problems with having a voter list that is legitimate, that does reflect people who have a right to vote within a state,” Johnson said. 
The panelists also debated the effect the increase in mail-in voting had on election fairness, with some arguing some polling stations do not have the capacity to efficiently count each mail-in ballot and others arguing it is one of the best ways to increase voter participation. 
“My issue is more around election administration and [whether] states [are] ready from an election administration standpoint to handle full automatic vote by mail,” said Peterson, who argued that mail-in ballots may not be efficient. 
Chavez, who lived in Colorado for many years where the state gives mail-in ballots to everyone registered to vote, said she views mail-in voting as essential to increasing voter turnout and is more concerned about other threats to fair elections.
“To me, the biggest threat coming from those state laws has less to do with access to the ballot box than it does with basically nullifying elections after votes are cast, and taking away, particularly in presidential elections, the right of the people to choose the President,” Chavez said. 
John Pandol, a 1982 graduate, began attending CPF virtual events when the coronavirus pandemic started. Pandeol said CPF’s emphasis on diverse political views inspired him to keep attending, as he usually only hears conservative views of the circles he is a part of in California. 
“I get to listen to the blue side of the state, which is something vital I’m normally not tapped into,” Pandol said. “So I get to hear directly from the other side.”
Akhavan attended the event and was pleased by the panelists’ transparency in their responses. The differing political beliefs added an opportunity for each viewer to draw their own conclusions about voting, he said. 
“We need to have more exploratory conversations with people who disagree with one another, so we can hear the very best arguments on all sides of these issues,” Akhavan said.

As an institution with a distinguished athletics program, USC boasts many talented athletes, especially of Latinx descent. As we celebrate Latinx Heritage Month, here are five top athletes of Latinx descent from the University.
Football/Baseball: Anthony Muñoz (‘80)
Known as one of the greatest offensive linemen in the history of football, Anthony Muñoz made his start with the Trojans. He earned multiple honors in his time on the football squad, being named a two-time All-American and helping lead the team to the 1978 national championship game. 
During his time at USC, Muñoz was known for his game against Ohio State in the 1980 Rose Bowl, where he made a return despite being out since the season opener because of an injury. His presence on the line helped Heisman winning running back Charles White run for 247 yards and lead the team to a 17-16 victory. 
Additionally, Muñoz played with USC’s baseball team during its 1978 national championship run. After college, Muñoz continued to dominate in the NFL with the Cincinnati Bengals, as the 11-time Pro Bowler was an All-Pro 11 times and won three Offensive Lineman of the Year awards. 
Soccer: Amy Rodriguez (‘08)
As one of the best players to suit up for the women’s soccer team, forward Amy Rodriguez brought the squad to new levels with her arrival in 2005. 
She started off strong, being named the Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, and then went on to score 31 goals with 17 assists in her USC career. In 2007, Rodriguez was able to bring the team a NCAA championship, the first in school history. 
Rodriguez also had to split her time during her college career to play at the national level, winning gold in the 2008 Olympics. After leaving USC, Rodriguez represented the United States many times, including appearances in the 2012 Olympics and in the 2015 World Cup when the U.S. won it all. 
Tennis: Robert Farah (‘10)
Coming from Colombia, tennis player Robert Farah arrived at USC in 2006 and had a monumental impact on the court. He led the Trojans to back-to-back NCAA Team Championships in 2009 and 2010 and was the 2008 NCAA Doubles Champion. 
By the time he ended his career with the Trojans in 2010, Farah was ranked as the No. 1 singles player and was part of the No. 2 doubles team in the nation. He also attained multiple honors such as the ITA All-American, All-Star and Player of the Year. 
After his time at USC, he became known as one of the best doubles players in the world, winning both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open back in 2019, and currenly boasts the No. 4 ranking. Additionally, Farah represented Colombia in the 2016 and 2020 Olympic games. 
Track & Field (Hurdles): Félix Sánchez (‘01)
The hurdles superstar has been a regular Olympian during his career. Although he was born and raised in the U.S., Sánchez represented the Dominican Republic in the Games. 
In his time with USC, Sánchez won the Pac-10 championship for the 400-meter hurdles. He also participated in the 1600-meter relay and was an All-American in that event as well. 
While at USC, Sánchez participated in the 2000 Olympics, but could not make the final heat for the 400-meter hurdles. After graduating from USC, he used this loss as motivation to become one of the best hurdlers in the world, winning gold in the 2004 and 2012 Olympics. 
Volleyball: Bibiana Candelas (‘05)
Bibiana Candelas was known for beach volleyball later in her career, but the Mexico native originally started off playing indoor volleyball. She was recruited to play for the Trojans in 2002 and became one of their best players, leading the team to back-to-back NCAA national championships in 2002 and 2003. 
Candelas was recognized as one of the best middle blockers in college and helped the Trojans go undefeated (35-0) during that 2003 season as an All-American. After USC, Candelas transitioned into playing beach volleyball.

Now that we’re about halfway through our first in-person semester in a while, I feel compelled to say:
I’m so happy we’re getting a fall break. 
Was university life always this taxing? Did online classes put me out of shape? Regardless, I gladly welcome this four-day weekend. I can’t wait to just sit back and catch up on my sleep.
That and watching old and new professional Super Smash Bros. players duke it out Saturday in “Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl.”
Yeah, I know, more Smash Bros. I promise I’ll tone it down after this column. Still, while this event may just sound like a run-of-the-mill kind of deal, the thought process behind it is worth some consideration. After all, what are a bunch of professional Smash players doing playing a Nickelodeon game?
Short answer: To spite Nintendo. 
Nowadays, it’s extremely rare to find an esports community at odds with the company who developed the game that brought the community together. This is mostly because companies try to be an active part of the professional scene of their games, promoting and even sometimes organizing large scale events with bountiful prizes.
But anyone who knows the tiniest bit about the pro Smash scene knows that’s not the case for Nintendo. In fact, many may even describe their involvement as detrimental. After all, the company has tried to shut down tournaments, limit streaming of it’s content and make Evo, the largest fighting game tournament in the world, remove “Super Smash Bros. Melee” from its event roster in 2013. 
When you’re a pro faced with those actions, it’s only natural to feel angry. 
Still, there’s not much athletes can actually do about it. Sure, they might go on social media and rant to their followers about this injustice, but at the end of the day, they keep playing the same game. Part of the reason is because they have accumulated years of experience and developed a bond with the actual video game. But in the case of “Super Smash Bros.”, it’s mostly because there are not that many similar games to play. 
To quickly illustrate, if a “Counter-Strike: Global Offensive” player was faced with the same dilemma, they could always just boot up “Valorant.” While there would be an adaptation phase, the overall skill set required to play the game is easily transferable, since the game is similar to “Counter-Strike.” 
It’s the same thing with “League of Legends” and “Dota 2.” In both cases, a professional athlete would be able to jump from one game to another and still do relatively well. Not only would their skills translate, but they would still participate in a thriving esports environment, as both alternatives have a deep (or at least, optimistically emerging) professional community. 
That is not the case for Smash players. Not only are there few platform fighting games overall, but there is virtually no other game of this genre with a professional scene. While there are a couple of possible explanations as to why, one of the main reasons is because no other game has the same amount of recognizable and widely adored characters as “Super Smash Bros.” Unless you are a huge media company with dozens of characters, odds are no one will want to watch your game being played. 
That is where Nickelodeon steps in.
Seemingly out of thin air, Nickelodeon announced it was making its own platform fighting game, filled with characters from its shows spanning all the way back to the ‘90s. Not only that, but Nickelodeon  also hired game company “Ludosity” to develop it, who already has experience with the technicalities of these types of games.
In an early proof of its skill, Nickelodeon announced that the game would have “rollback netcode,” a function that effectively minimizes online lag that even “Super Smash Bros. Ultimate” does not have. 
So when the game finally came out last week, Smash players knew exactly what to do.
In what can only be described as a massive demonstration of willpower, various elements of the Smash community banded together to raise, from the ground up, “Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl’s” viability as an esports title. 
In just one week, professional team “Panda” had already held a charity tournament, featuring various famous streamers connected to the Smash Bros. scene. This Saturday, Twitch streamer Ludwig will be hosting his own championship, this time with actual professional athletes from both “Super Smash Bros. Melee” and “Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.” 
Is the game perfect? Definitely not. As it currently stands, characters do not even have voices. 
But there is something to be said about the colossal efforts that the Smash community is putting into making this game widely respected. While it is too early to properly judge the impact of their actions, we can still draw some conclusions simply because this is happening in the first place. 
For gaming companies, this serves as a cautionary tale that shows the importance of being aware of your fans’ needs. For athletes, it demonstrates how a community can go a long way in legitimizing new elements and making them common practice in the professional scene. For us viewers, it proves that, more than anything else, esports main driving force has and always will be its players.

Despite a 3-3 season, USC managed to maintain its talent development pipeline to the NFL, with 29 total Trojans currently on a roster. Let’s take a look at how some of USC’s premier football talent fared during the 2021 NFL Season. 
Amon-Ra St. Brown
One of four Trojans drafted in the 2021 NFL Draft, wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown is still looking for his first NFL touchdown and his first win through five weeks with the rebuilding Detroit Lions. Although he hasn’t gotten his name on the score sheet, St. Brown amounted 19 receptions and 178 yards while leading or tied for the most targets on the team in the last two weeks. 
During his time at USC, the 5 foot, 11 inch, 197-pound wide receiver made his living in the slot, a trend that continues in the NFL. His average foot speed and lack of physicality have proved a non-issue, with his crafty release techniques and excellent body control translating to the professional game. The fourth round pick will continue to see an uptick in targets as the Lions remain searching for a diamond in the rough. 
Juju Smith-Schuster
Disaster struck Sunday for the Trojan fan-favorite. Wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster dislocated his right shoulder and will undergo surgery later this week that is expected to sideline him for about four months. It will likely end his season. 
After a nine-touchdown campaign last year, it seemed as though Smith-Schuster was ready to take the leap as a No. 1 receiver on a championship contending team, but he struggled to start his 2021 season. The TikTok star only has one score — a rushing touchdown — while pulling in 15 receptions on 28 targets for 129 yards. 
Fans attributed Smith-Schuster’s struggles to quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s play. The three-year Trojan could have some big decisions to make in the upcoming offseason, as his one-year contract with the Steelers comes to an end. Just 24 years old, Smith-Schuster will have suitors in free agency, but could see his market price drop because of his shoulder injury and lack of on-field production.
Everson Griffen
The oldest Trojan on this list, Pro-Bowl defensive end Everson Griffen was inserted back into the Minnesota Vikings starting lineup Sunday for the first time since the 2019 playoffs, and he did not disappoint. Griffen created havoc up front against the Detroit Lions offensive line, putting up a season-high six pressures and two sacks. 
Despite Griffin playing a season-high 49 snaps against the Lions, Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer looks to preserve the dangerous edge rusher for the strenuous 17-game season, hoping to keep his snap count in 30-35 range. However, Zimmer might be unable to keep Griffin on the bench if the 33-year-old continues this level of production. 
Michael Pittman Jr.
The second-year wide receiver raised some eyebrows to begin his 2021 campaign but received even more national recognition this week after “Moss-ing” Baltimore Ravens cornerback Anthony Averett for his first touchdown of the season on Monday Night Football. 
Pittman Jr. finds himself in a similar situation to St. Brown — a talented receiver oozing with potential on a rebuilding team. After losing to the Ravens, the Colts dropped to 1-4 in a lackluster AFC South. Pittman Jr. will continue to put up impressive stats, but will truly take the leap to a top-tier receiver in the league when he can translate his production into wins.
Robert Woods
Something must be said of USC’s wide receiver coaching staff over the past decade, as it continues to develop and filter elite-level talent into the pros. The fourth wide receiver on this list, Woods exploded in Week 5 after a quiet start to kick off the 2021 season, pulling in 12 receptions for 150 yards in a 26-17 Los Angeles Rams win against division rival Seattle. 
Quarterback Matthew Stafford developed a slight dependency on Cooper Kupp this season, who amounted 37 receptions this season, tied for second in the entire league. Stafford, however, focused more on Woods against the Seahawks, with his season high in receptions in Week 5. Woods has had three straight seasons with at least 900 receiving yards. In an extremely tough NFC West with the undefeated Arizona Cardinals, the Rams are going to need an alert and engaged Woods to make it out of that division alive.

‘Tis the season of Pumpkin Spice Latte drinking and pumpkin pie eating! The pumpkin craze is back and better than ever, and Trader Joe’s is on top of their game once again. Their wide selection of fall goodies is definitely worth checking out. Here are some of the best pumpkin products you can find this fall. 
Pumpkin Joe-Joe’s
First up is a Trader Joe’s classic: Joe-Joe’s, which consist of two wafers sandwiched together with cream (similar to an Oreo). The pumpkin twist on these iconic cookies is a great way to celebrate the beginning of fall. Equally crunchy and creamy, these seasonal Joe-Joe’s feature mouth-watering cinnamon and caramel flavors. Beware, once the box is open, it’s hard to close until all the pumpkin goodness is gone. 
Pumpkin Ice Cream
As you peruse frozen desserts this autumn, keep your eye out for this limited-edition treat. This ice cream is the definition of pumpkin perfection. A balanced blend of warm nutmeg and ginger with a strong pumpkin flavor, this ice cream is decadent, yet soft, and not overwhelmingly sweet. One quart simply isn’t enough. A round of applause for the shining star of the frozen food aisle this season. 
Pumpkin Spice Coffee
Not too sweet, not too bitter. This item is a convenient alternative when the PSL bill starts racking up. This pumpkin coffee comes in either individual pods or a larger canister of ground coffee, and the flavor is nutty and spicy. Try adding a scoop of pumpkin ice cream for a doubly pumpkin flavoured affogato at home. Trader Joe’s seasonal Non-Dairy Pumpkin Oat Beverage would also pair perfectly with this drip coffee. 
Pumpkin Bagels and Cream Cheese
Calling all bagel and cream cheese lovers! In my mind, nothing beats a good bagel with cream cheese, and these are a great opportunity to shake up your normal morning routine. The pumpkin spice bagels are a simple yet satisfying fall breakfast. For true pumpkin enthusiasts, Trader Joe’s offers a complementary pumpkin cream cheese to spread on top. Note that a gluten-free option is also available. 
Pumpkin Bread & Muffin Mix
Finally, we’ve reached the baking aisle, and my top recommendation has to be the pumpkin bread mix. Pumpkin bread is a staple every time fall rolls around. This recipe, which requires just the package ingredients — in addition to eggs, water and vegetable oil — produces a nice, fluffy loaf or about a dozen muffins. This mix is quick and easy to make for novice bakers and goes best with a hot cup of joe. 
Pumpkin Pancake and Waffle Mix
Though the great debate between waffles and pancakes continues, you won’t have to choose sides with this mix! This is another pumpkin-flavored mix Trader Joe’s is offering right now, and it is equally as delicious. Just add milk, butter and an egg to the dry mix, and you’re all set for your morning treat. These pancakes and waffles will be so flavorful they’ll even taste amazing without added syrup or powdered sugar, though feel free to add some Trader Joe’s pumpkin butter or spread. 
Pumpkin Spice Batons
These pumpkin spice batons are a seasonal spin-off of Trader Joe’s regular cocoa batons. The canister contains thin, wafer-style cookies filled with a delectable and flavor-packed pumpkin cream. They add a satisfying crunch when coupled with a cup of warm tea or a scoop of rich ice cream. Night or day, these are guaranteed to sweeten up any part of your fall days. 
Pumpkin Cereal Bars
Think pumpkin-inspired Fig Newtons. These pumpkin bars are the ideal fall snack on-the-go. While they are definitely on the sweeter side, they are still worth a try, and anybody with a sweet tooth will surely enjoy these. These bars are a good option for a quick bite between classes, especially with midterms in full swing.
Pumpkin Tortilla Chips
For those who enjoy more savory snacks, these pumpkin tortilla chips are a fantastic choice. These chips, with their pumpkin puree and seeds, add some fall vibes to the chip aisle. A delicious combination of savory and sweet, these are great for dessert or late-night snacking and studying. Plus, they are conveniently gluten-free and vegan. 
Pumpkin Brioche
This is by far the best pumpkin sliced bread on the market — so soft and buttery yet light and airy at the same time. The pumpkin spice flavor is subtle but undeniably tasty. With this bread, there are infinite possibilities for consumption. Pop a slice in the toaster for a crispier option. Slather some butter or jam on it. Whip up some eggs for French toast. Make a fall-themed sandwich. This bread is endlessly versatile and always delicious.

Catching up with friends after a busy day at USC Village or eating at one of the various dining establishments is always a good time, but for anyone who wants to “Taco ‘bout a good time,” there is a new place in town — City Tacos. 
The taco place first opened in San Diego’s North Park neighborhood in 2014, expanded to seven other locations and took a trip to Hollywood in August with its first store at USC Village. Describing its food as “innovative, delicious and unique,” the eatery is anything but boring. With different flavor combinations such as mashed potatoes, raisins, almonds, strawberries and caramelized pineapples in its tacos, City Tacos is not afraid to experiment.  
“Our tacos tend to be authentic,” said Hector Aguirre, manager and part owner of City Tacos. “We’re very innovative, adding different types of ingredients into them and … different flavors on them.”    
For those who want to stick to the regular, the menu has more traditional options including homestyle tacos and a menu with vegetarian and pescaterian choices. 
“We have a little bit for everyone,” Aguirre said. ”If you’re pescetarian, even vegetarian … it’s not just isolated for one set of people. We want people to try a little bit of everything.” 
Located on West Jefferson Blvd., City Tacos replaced Trejo’s Tacos and already seems to be a popular option for students and community members taking a Tuesday afternoon lunch break. 
I ordered the “Pollo City,” one of the House Favorites, and the “Machaca De Pollo,” a white chicken “golden-fried rolled taco served with beer fondue and a semi-spicy, serrano-habanero creamy green salsa within a corn tortilla.”  
The small portion sizes allow you to try multiple dishes or eat with friends tapas-style. As a chicken-lover, the “Pollo City” hits all the marks and the meat complements well with the tamarindo aioli. The dish also included a combination of golden raisins and toasted almonds that I did not personally like.  
The “Machaca De Pollo” was unlike anything I tried before. As a fan of anything fried, I liked the crunchy texture of the corn tortilla, the well-seasoned flavor of the beer fondue and the kick of the serrano-habanero creamy green salsa. I would have preferred to have my sauce on the side instead of having my tortilla dunked in it which made it a mess to eat. The fondue also made the tortilla soggy if not instantly consumed. 
For Aguirre, his favorite taco is the “Mexicali” which is also one of the most popular offerings. He describes it as “[their] version of a carne asada” that includes melted cheese at the bottom, mashed potatoes and arrachera steak topped with crema fresca and cotija cheese. He recommends the “Pescado” for anyone with a sweet tooth with its fried mahi-mahi, cabbage and topped with a strawberry jam and chipotle aioli. 
“Basically [our taco is] like an art. For this type of art, you can actually eat it,” Aguirre said.
For burrito-lovers, City Taco serves a cheese crusted spinach wrap and a meat and vegetarian option exclusively for it’s Los Angeles location because of the city’s love for the food. The choice has been popular with the restaurant selling out of burritos, Aguirre said.   
Overall, I was surprised by the different flavor combinations I experienced and how the tiny portions gave me a chance to try multiple dishes. With fall break almost upon us, I would recommend the place for anyone looking to try a distinct take on tacos without breaking the bank.

The Nick Metropolis Collectible’s store sticks out like a colorful, chaotic thumb on its fresh location in West Adams. The pink exterior, with prophetic red phrases painted on its sides such as “Love, is King” would make any unsuspecting passerby take a peek. Well, that, and the hundreds of thousands of knick-knacks such as mannequins, furniture, fast food signs and giant letters that crowd the store’s adjacent lot.
If one decides to give into their curiosity, they’ll encounter a cacophonic array of tchotchkes crowding the quirky antique store. Amid the chaos and chirping of pet birds from a nearby cage, they might even encounter Nick Metropolis, a sunny salesman with red hair and a wardrobe of vibrant ducky shirts.
“I’m kind of all over the place with my personality and the way I text and stuff,” Metropolis said. “That’s just who I am. I’m just out there. People think I’m crazy, I always substitute the word ‘unique.’” 
The store’s beginning is just as eccentric as its owner. Metropolis moved from Rochester, N.Y. in the ’60s to pursue a career in music, with aspirations of becoming like Bob Dylan or the Beatles with his protest-adjacent music.
When that pursuit didn’t get him far, he started acting after actress Shelley Winters pushed him to pursue it and got him a full ride to the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. After a few stints, Metropolis became broke and began selling objects and furniture on the road. He gained popularity, and his store suddenly became a landmark for Hollywood tour buses.
After Metropolis earned enough to open a store near the corner of his DIY garage sale on the corner of La Brea, The Nick Metropolis Collectible store was born. 
“That was the best corner on all of La Brea. And I was in an alley, so 20 feet behind my desk we were feeding homeless Vietnam veterans,” Metropolis said. “Twenty feet in front of my desk, it’s Lana Del Rey and Miley Cyrus and the [movie] studios. So that 40-foot radius [was] every day of my life … the dark and the light side of that corner was my life for twenty-six years.”
Metropolis put every dime on the line, and it paid off. The store was a hit. It drew in set designers, movie studios, vintage aficionados and even a regular rotation of celebrity clientele including Michael Jackson, Drew Barrymore, Jimmy Kimmel and Rick Ross.
“Now, I’m close to some of those guys like Rick Ross,” Metropolis said. “Rick comes into the store with an entourage, eight or 10 guys, and they spend thousands of dollars and it’s always fun waiting on them. They come into the store and get stoned out and he’s just been really kind and generous over the years.” 
Unfortunately, rising rent prices forced the iconic La Brea location to close its doors in June 2019. After moving to its current location in West Adams later that month, Metropolis has ingrained himself within the local community, particularly among USC students.
However, the eccentric store is under threat of being shut down once more due to housing development. According to Los Angeles City Planning records, Tripalink, a leasing agency that rents to USC students in the area, submitted an application after buying the property in 2018 to construct a 10-unit condominium on the store’s property, demolishing the century-old building.
The Daily Trojan reached out to several staff members from Tripalink — including the project manager and regional manager for the construction project — however, they did not reply in time for publication.
“I think it’s disappointing, both the effect [the construction] would have from gentrification and in the loss of culture for that area … It’s such an important part of the community. [Metropolis] knows everybody. He talks to everybody,” said Tyler Sinness, a junior majoring in narrative studies. “And not only that, but his place would be replaced with one of these blocky apartment buildings cheaply made that are popping up everywhere and destroying the fabric of the community.”
Sinness and their friends stumbled upon the collectibles store one evening and spent 40 minutes after the store closed to revel in Metropolis’ stories and left with a two-dollar bill, which has the lettering “In God We Trust,” highlighted in yellow.
Ann Xu, a junior majoring in animation and digital arts, felt an especially rare, yet deep, sense of community in the store when she met Metropolis her freshman year after finding his place on Yelp.
“It’s just like L.A. feels really disconnected for the most part. I don’t feel ever connected to people in this city,” Xu said. “He’s so genuine and it makes me feel, this is a total stranger, a totally eerie little man and I kind of made a connection with him … He would recognize me and tell me the same story over and over again, it feels like my grandpa right in the middle of this chaotic city.”
Nicks Metropolis Collectible serves as a great equalizer — everything from a large hand statue to a 1920s gilded mirror to a large Clydesdale horse to Kanye West paintings to a grand piano is brought up at the same level, residing in the same cluttered room, with no hierarchy or discrimination.
When Los Angeles seems too sprawled and alienating, it can be revitalizing for others to conjoin in this eclectic amalgamation of belongings. Whether a Grammy Award Winning singer or random passerby, a coffee publicist or a millionaire amusement park scion, Metropolis said he greets them all with the same purpose — to learn their stories. 
“I love the furniture business and having really cool collectibles stuff, but I’m kind of over it. I’ve been doing it for 33 years because I’m a people person,” Metropolis said. “I like the stories of the people that come in. So when someone walks in the door, one of my friends thinks, ‘What are your kids or your students’ or ‘What do you do?’ ‘What’s your passion?’ And then, I said, ‘To hear people’s stories.’ That’s what I thrive on, telling my stories and also hearing other people’s stories.”
Sometimes his curiosity gets the best of him. He mentions an old manager from La Brea who would scoff at him for his tangential discussions.
“He was all about the money. So, if he came now and we were having this interview he would say ‘What are you doing? You’re in the furniture business. The landlord is going to be here, the rabbi, your rabbi landlord is going to be here in five minutes and you owe thousands of dollars and you’re BS-ing with these people’, you know, ‘cause I’m a storyteller, right?,” Metropolis said.
But Metropolis isn’t just in the business of stories — he also prioritizes the livelihood of the communities he resides in. While in his La Brea location, he would help unhoused individuals by allowing them into his store. He would also rescue dogs and foster them in the store until they found a home. 
“Early on, I saw what it was like for people needing to sell things. I would have people come saying, ‘Nick, I gotta pay my cellphone bill, can you buy this from me?’” Metropolis said. “So we used to help everyone there as much as we could.”
Now at his West Adams location, he leaves free food, clothing and children’s toys and books on a table outside his store for the local community. 
The local community appears to value his presence there, according to the West Adams Neighborhood Association, who provided a statement on the potential plans for development to the  Daily Trojan:
“We want this neighborhood to maintain its standards of family community and independent businesses that service the people within this community for years to come, we want to create an environment for small local businesses to thrive. This mass development threatens the family dynamic of this neighborhood from senior citizens to children.” 
Nick talks about this impending threat very matter-of-factly, with a lingering hope that everything will  work out during a virtual public hearing coming Oct. 13. There, community and council members will conjoin to speak their thoughts on the issue.
If things don’t work out, Metropolis said he will close the shop for good and go on to pursue more film work, like in his old acting days. 
“The hearing has a possibility of changing it, but I’m hoping that they won’t want to dig for about a year or at the most two years,” Metropolis said. “If I could get even one year, I’d be so grateful because I would get up off my butt and start promoting the film work, selling a lot of stuff.”
Metropolis also hopes to create a traveling furniture store in a truck, so he can drive around L.A. spreading his odd tchotchkes throughout the city.
“Pay as much as you can forward with your time, money sometimes just holding the door for somebody or a hug. All of that is paying love forward,” Metropolis said while holding his famous two-dollar bill in his hand with “PAY IT FORWARD” written in blue marker. “Love has infinite ways  to come from you.”

When the Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook outage occurred on Oct. 4, USC students buzzed with frustrations. For international students who use WhatsApp as a primary communication method, this outage was isolating and uncomfortable. Students clicked the apps mindlessly for hours, hoping they would finally load after eight tries. Unfortunately, apps were inaccessible for hours and disrupted many people’s routines. 
We rely on social media platforms for tidbits of both entertainment and information. For this reason, the new Texas law, which prohibits social media platforms from regulating users and misinformation, is dangerous and could potentially alter our daily lives in the same way Monday’s technological issues did. 
On Sept. 9, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed House Bill 20 into law. This law mandates “social media platforms with over 50 million monthly users in the U.S.” to publish details about removed posts and suspended profiles twice each year.
Additionally, it bars social media platforms from banning Texan users because of their political viewpoints and requires an outlet for users to claim legal breaches. Essentially, Texas created this law to cater to the growing conservative sentiment social media sites silence their views, a claim that was only punctuated when Facebook and Twitter suspended former President Donald Trump last year. 
Abbott wrote an opinion piece for The Washington Post titled “A new Texas law fights Big Tech censorship. Last week showed why we need it.” The Republican governor argues that The Wall Street Journal’s report on Facebook and a Federal Election Commission ruling on Twitter restricting the “Hunter Biden laptop story” warranted the law. 
However, Abbott fails to realize his standpoint is erroneously partisan — everyone benefits from social media platforms filtering out misinformation. Abbott’s perspective is right-skewed, as evidenced by his allegation that the Hunter Biden story was unjustly censored. 
In reality, details from this story were only “confirmed” by a supposed independent source from Politico this September, almost a year after the 2020 election. Choosing such an example highlights Abbott’s subjectivity.
Additionally, the first amendment only prohibits Congress from enacting laws that prohibit free speech; to claim that these platforms have violated the First Amendment’s free speech clause is a stretch. 
Abbott and his allies also fail to consider that social media has become a medium for sharing and disseminating valuable information. With 42% of the world’s population using social media as of 2019, these platforms have become more than media for users to share selfies or pictures of their Sunday brunch. 
The Jan. 6 insurrection exemplified how conspiracy theories and lies can spread so quickly on social media and radicalize people. The event pinpointed social media sites’ responsibility to not give platforms to users who propagate misinformation.
Not only was Trump banned from Facebook and Twitter, but so were more than 70,000 profiles with ties to QAnon. Youtube also took down videos from Trump’s account that appeared to instigate violence, and Facebook finally started to take down posts that used #StopTheSteal. The fact that these platforms did not intervene until the insurrection should serve as a wake-up call to social media content regulation. 
We live in an age where it is incredibly easy to post misinformation online but difficult to spot it. Eighty six percent of adults get news from their social media account. Fallacies are presented as facts because there is no one there to monitor each and every tweet, Facebook status update or Instagram infographic for false information. 
Misinformation actually keeps users engaged by creating echo chambers; therefore, social media platforms actually benefit from it and are less likely to step in. This Texas law is incredibly dangerous because it could perpetuate this negative cycle of echo chambers, thus leading to more and more misinformed people all across the globe, especially when it comes to politics, which excites users more. 
For college students who use social media as a means of spreading information about their activist pursuits, organizations and such, it’s imperative social media companies filter out misinformation and dangerous users. USC depends on social media, such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, to spread important information. The Daily Trojan itself uses such platforms to promote articles that hold valuable information for students. If misinformation permeates these sites, then these salient messages could be lost. We need social media regulation, for USC students and beyond.

There’s a video of California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein that lives in my head rent-free. If you don’t already know what I’m referring to, here’s the brief summary — the clip depicts Feinstein arguing over the hypothetical passage of the Green New Deal with a group of children from the Sunrise Movement, a climate advocacy organization.
 “I’ve been doing this for 30 years. I know what I’m doing,” Feinstein tells the kids, referring to an alternative, more moderate climate proposal that she was planning to introduce to the Senate. Spoiler alert — the bill has yet to pass the Senate’s introduction stage.
I’m not sure what scares me more — Feinstein’s abrupt response to the young climate activists, or the fact she’s been in office since Bill Clinton was president. Historically, Congress has failed to effectively pass environmental policy because of contingent factors that may suffer as a result of stricter legislation, such as the economy. These efforts are only as valid as their weakest link, so to speak. More intentional environmental legislation starts with more intentional legislators. 
The concept of a “career politician” ruins what it means to be a civil servant. Instead of making the most of a limited office term, many local, state and federal government employees play the long game. While politicians have to, arguably, actually accomplish things in office to have a viable shot at reelection, they generally shun radical change or systemic upheaval in favor of more politically amicable bills, laws and cross-party compromise. 
Instead of attempting significant changes, politicians prioritize improving their approval rating because they fear polarizing their constituency. A politician’s career is now viable at the expense of effective — yet controversial — climate improvement. 
In today’s political climate, there’s no doubt you have to play the game. New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the perfect example. As a fiery outsider looking to oust a longtime incumbent, she was the definition of a grassroots organizer looking to rearrange the establishment with her Democratic-Socialist ideas. Perhaps working within the system is the only way to achieve change in the establishment bureaucracy. 
However, AOC’s priorities have shifted now that she is an incumbent. In a vote to fund Israel’s military forces in September, she abstained while her Democratic colleagues rejected it. At the 2021 Met Gala, she made a — in my opinion, rather confusing — statement by wearing a dress emblazoned with “Tax the Rich” at an event that epitomizes U.S. elitism. 
Perhaps eliminating the ability to spend an entire career in public office could motivate AOC and the bill’s co-sponsors to take the Green New Deal from an umbrella concept to reality. If Congressional representatives were limited to one term in the House, perhaps they would draft specificities and smaller pieces of legislation rather than advertising an optical, far-reaching “socialist super-package.”
As a result of increasingly lax term limits, people such as Feinstein spend their entire adult lives building a political office career. Trump’s rather ironic trope about Biden’s physical and mental fitness to run the country is actually a legitimate concern for all of our politicians, although not for the reasons one might think. 
As America’s political leaders’ average ages and lifetime expectancies continue to rise, so does the urgency to address the climate crisis. With all due respect, Feinstein perfectly exemplifies an older generation who simply won’t bear the same brunt of the impact as the young activists she discouraged.
I’m in no way implying that a political leader’s age affects their ability to do their job just as effectively. As Feinstein said herself, she has multiple decades of experience in handling political issues. 
However, priorities change across generations. A politician who already has kids and grandchildren may not feel the same urgency to remediate pollution or the microplastic crisis as a college student who has yet to enter the real world. 
As far as the case for climate change goes, we need more diverse representation in our government to assess the situation’s nuances and craft adequate policy accordingly. Career politicians crowd the way for newcomers who reflect the diversity of constituencies around the country, whether it be age, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status or able.
In order to achieve the kind of drastic environmental policy we so desperately need, we must also reframe the way we perceive our political leaders. In no world should politicians have celebrity status cough cough. Because they’re leaders of society with very real responsibilities, they should be held accountable for their actions just like anyone else. 
We’re a long way from the system I’m suggesting here — stringent term limits, greater representation, a political environment that isn’t riddled with lobbyists, nepotism and the power of money — but the future of the environment begins with the law laid down by those in power. Conflicts of interest are inevitable, but the government must return to what it was inherently supposed to be — a group of representatives reflecting the interests and wishes of the people instead of pursuing unmatched power for the sake of a stable paycheck. 
Whether our political representatives have 30 years or minutes of experience, we must reconsider their participation in lawmaking at any level. Ironically, while Feinstein may have accumulated decades more political office experience than most, she has little environmental progress to show beside the California Desert Protection and Recreation Act. We need more voices who make big moves toward environmental protection and remediation without fear of public disapproval. 
The plea to address centuries of political corruption is nothing new, but from an environmental perspective we need a huge change. It’s time to dismantle the current political system — the environment deserves better, and so do constituents.

The land USC occupies belongs to the Tongva people, the Indigenous community of the Los Angeles Basin. For over 9,000 years, they ruled Tovaangar, which covered almost 4,000 square miles. Independent villages traditionally ruled the lands but were connected by language, culture and trade. Known as “people of the Earth,” the Tongva were deeply connected to their environment, believing that humans must participate in a mutually respectful relationship with plants and animals. When the Spanish first arrived in Southern California in 1769, there were nearly 100 Tongva villages and 5,000 people. The Tongva population today is estimated to be 3,000. These are some of the prominent Tongva sites from across the region.
Kuruvungna Sacred Springs:
Santa Monica’s earliest inhabitants lived in the village of Kuruvungna, meaning “a place where we are in the sun.” The springs served as a source of freshwater for the Tongva and were surrounded by tule-thatched houses called kiiys. Now developed as University High School, part of the L.A. Unified School District, the springs still exist today on a portion of the site amid the rich foliage of the sacred ground. 
Yaangna:
Yaangna was the largest known Tongva village near current downtown L.A. beneath the 101 Freeway. Settled along the L.A. River, the village was an important trading center for people in the region. A sacred sycamore tree stood at the center of the village, providing a place for shelter under its branches and conference among tribal elders. 
San Gabriel Mission:
Before the arrival of the Spanish, the San Gabriel Valley featured multiple interconnected native communities situated in a concentric circle. Recognizing the fertile land as ideal for producing crops, the Spanish built their first settlement in the Valley. The Mission later served as a site for the forced enslavement and assimilation of the Tongva people. 
Pimu: 
Catalina Island used to be home to roughly 2,500 members of the Tongva tribe. The tribe utilized flaura, fauna, fresh water and copious marine life on the island. They established small villages where Avalon, Two Harbors and Toyon Bay are now located. Families created effective food systems using the resources around them. Men hunted the wild game while women gathered seeds, berries and other items provided by the land. 
Puvungna: 
Puvungna was a village on the land where the campus of Cal State Long Beach resides. Southern Californian tribes such as the Tongva and Acjachemen considered the land sacred. Puvungna was known as the “place of emergence.” The site is considered more than a village because it was also a gathering place and an active intertribal ceremonial site. Five hundred acres and more than a dozen archaeological sites have been attributed to Puvungna village sites, but most have been decimated and built over by development.
