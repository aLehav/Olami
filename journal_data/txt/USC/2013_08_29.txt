The USC Initiative for Israeli Arts and Humanities hopes to continue drawing students’ attention to the cultural aspects of Israel in its second season, beginning this fall.
The program aims to broaden discussions on Israel and Judaism by introducing noted Israeli artists to campus.
According to Professor Ruth Weisberg of the Roski School of Fine Arts, Israel’s art scene is large compared to its physical size. Weisberg and other artists have ventured to Israel in the past, and she said that although many programs exist to study Israel through a geopolitical lens, there is little academic activity focused on its cultural side.
“Artists express themselves, but they also express with cultural underpinnings,” Weisberg said.
Israeli art encompasses everything from dance to painting to printmaking, but Weisberg noted recurring elements that make it distinctive, such as an “interest in the land, the history of the Middle East and Jewish history.”
Sarah Benor, interim director of the Louchheim School of Judaic Studies, who is based at Hebrew Union College but also works with USC, is enthusiastic about the new program.
“It’s a wonderful initiative. Ruth Weisberg is the perfect person to create this and bring it to USC,” Benor said.
According to Benor, the program is open to all students, regardless of race or ethnicity.
“[The program] is not just for those with Jewish heritage or for those who are Jewish in religion,” Benor said. “[Jewish studies] is a fascinating field with a rich history, specifically when seen through these programs [that] take another angle.”
The Jewish studies department has also been expanding its class offerings. This semester’s classes include “Jewish Magic in the Ancient World” and “Gender and Judaism.”
To accompany these new classes, the initiative puts on a variety of events throughout the year. It has already hosted the likes of Israeli author Mier Shalev and artist Mira Maylor. The initiative’s next events are a show highlighting the choreography of Barak Marshall and the dance troupe BODYTRAFFIC, and an exchange printmaking exhibition featuring Irena Gordon, a curator of the Jerusalem Printmaking Workshop, this September at the Pacific Design Center.
The program, which is sponsored through the Roski School of Fine Arts, is organized by a steering committee of various faculty members from Dornsife, the School of Cinematic Arts, the Fisher Museum, the Thornton School of Music and Hebrew Union College.
Weisberg said that she hopes the program will continue to receive attention from those interested in art in general, not just those interested in Judaic studies.
“I find that the students in the various art schools are interested both in their own medium, but also there’s also a wonderful interest that’s been nourished by Visions and Voices,” Weisberg said. “There’s more sophistication about arts in general across the different disciplines.”

“I’m a Scholar, Not a Criminal.” These six words, written by USC graduate student Makiah Green, went viral in the aftermath of the Los Angeles Police Department’s arrest of six black students at an off-campus party last May.
They were posted on Green’s blog, “Makiah-isms,” and fueled the USChangeMovement, an initiative against LAPD’s alleged racial profiling.
The charges against the six students were eventually dropped, but Green’s activism has only grown stronger. She has been working closely with the USC Dept. of Public Safety to implement new party procedures this semester for off-campus social events to avoid future misunderstandings.
“I felt extremely compelled to really push this thing forward and do everything that I could to make sure that developments were getting done,” Green said. “We must take advantage of this opportunity to create change.”
Green said she has been meeting with DPS Chief John Thomas and Capt. Steve Alegre to solidify new policies to improve communication between USC students and law enforcement.
Thomas said one of his goals this semester is to encourage students, DPS officers and community members to become engaged with each other in a progressive way.
“What I want is to create community — that’s common unity,” Thomas said. “I want everyone to engage with each other to the degree that people know who’s on their block and are looking out for each other.”
To improve this communication, Green and other students have dictated a new party protocol and notification policy for off-campus social events. This involves having a party liaison present, meaning two sober attendees will be responsible for interacting with DPS or LAPD.
Students will have access to an informal party registration form to notify DPS when they are hosting a large-scale party, or any gathering with amplified sound, in order to minimize any surprise if DPS receives a noise complaint. Students will fill out the time, location and how many people they are expecting, as well as designate party liaisons with their contact information.
Thomas said this would help prevent the type of event that occurred on May 4 since they could directly call a point of contact at the party, instead of responding immediately when they receive a complaint.
“This way everybody can win,” Thomas said. “The students can have their social events in the community, the community can expect that people are going to let them know they’re having a party, and DPS can work with them to help plan it and help keep them safe.”
Students have had mixed reactions to DPS’s new plan.
“I think this is a great step forward between DPS and the community, but I worry that communication will not be effective enough. This is a great starting point. Last May taught us that the relationship needs to improve,” Roonhee Ko, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, said.
Others worry less about the relationship between law enforcement and the university, and more about the practicality of such measures.
“I think that while students would be willing to register their parties online, they aren’t really going to be able to estimate the amount of people that will attend their party, so I don’t know how successful these new protocols really will be,” said Meghan Rajeev, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
Green said she has dedicated her summer to voicing her concern and helping to implement specific policies. She feels it is important that all students and community members feel safe and valued on and around the university campus.
“I think it’s hard to survive in a place where you do not feel welcomed or feel the university support you,” Green said. “I want to make sure that all the suffering that people have been through in the past or that’s been around this campus for years was not in vain.”
Green said she considers the incident last May a positive situation because it has set the university up for the possibility to create change. Other students, however, disagree.
“I think the measures themselves seem reasonable, but they shouldn’t have been brought about by that incident — that was racism, plain and simple,” said Molly Quinlan, a sophomore majoring in theater.
Green looked forward to developing an official student organization at USC to encourage students to speak up about related issues. Green said she hopes the organization will work to break down subconscious biases toward certain races, cultures and religions and develop a healthy relationship with law enforcement.
“There has been a turbulent history in this city,” Green said. “And this is a monumental moment that we have the opportunity to finally make progress because of how things unfolded.”

Please, not everyone at USC drinks or does drugs
Some attend “cake & ice cream” parties, euphemism for foodie events.
Drunk USC students are the single greatest menace in South Central, Los Angeles.
No, Sorry for Partying, drunk USC students are a threat to themselves, other students and the ascendency of USC as a top academic institution. Last fall Stanford, for example,  noted an increase in alcohol ER admission. Fraternities willingly agreed to be fully responsible to check that any student at their parties were legal drinking age, remained sober and if a student came “fully loaded”, they would be turned away.
The corollary for USC is plain. If someone hosts a party as Ms. Green proposes (non-Greek or Greek) not only is that person(s) responsible for notifying USC, but assuring all attendees are 21 and remain sober. A tiered penalty system for failure to meet responsibility would come into play.
USC needs to decide if it is going to be a fun, top academic school or a widely acknowledged top party school. Top performing students, “scholars”, are not going to be interested in a university where graduate student “scholars” lobby to party like academically non-motivated high school students.
Bringing the social milieu in line with the university’s mission to be a top academic university will contribute to the enjoyment and ease of all and prevent future, preventable risks. In such an environment students themselves would shoot down an idea or laugh at an idea to bring a seedy downtown rave promoter to the heart of campus.
USC has an opportunity for a fresh start to address the party school residual so mismatched with its stellar academic advances with a new dean and assistant dean of students.
Well put USC parent, and very articulate too!..Your discourse is more impressive than most SC students’, unfortunately.
“I’m a Scholar, Not a Criminal.”  
“a party liaison present, meaning two sober attendees will be responsible for interacting with DPS or LAPD.”
There is some incompatibility in these statements.
1. Though Ms Green, a graduate student, is very likely over 21, how many underage students drink at USC? This is especially of concern in light of the rape allegations reported elsewhere and the “party school” reputation that still follows USC.
2. If there needs to be two sober students as liaisons with DPS, Ms. Green’s comment implies other students will not be sober. The community seems to have had more than their fill of inebriated college students. Ms. Green seems to want to justify past and future behavior that is harmful to students and the university, as well as seemingly seducing USC into a continuing pattern of permissive, enabling behavior.
The new dean and assistant dean of students have much work to do. I do applaud Ms Green for continuing a dialogue which in part serves to highlight the work that needs to be done to create a social environment at USC compatible with the many dedicatred scholars, both undergraduate and graduate, who are attending USC in ever increasing numbers.
UCLA must be laughing at us – but i guess these are the issues that occur when you have a school like  USC that is nestled in a ghetto hood
Ummm, I don’t know about that. As an Asian-American SC alumnus, I had an ex g/f, many friends from high school, acquaintances, etc. who attended UCLA. And the impression I got, after attending some of their parties/get-togethers, was people over there party just as much as people here. Not everyone there is busting their tails by hitting the books; not everyone there is a bio-chem (pre-med) major who’s smart enough to achieve a 3.6+ GPA and 36+ on their MCATs (many of them drop out and switch to softology majors after a couple quarters); many go straight to worthless moot majors…because UCLA isn’t the academic powerhouse they try to paint themselves as….That’s schools like Stanford, Ivies, Caltech, and commensurate. 
btw, there was an incident at UCLA a couple years ago, in which an Asian male stabbed another male at some Greek party. SC may be in the ghetto, but UCLA’s got the same riff raff that slip through their cracks.

On the weekend of Sept. 20 to 22, students from the USC Rocket Lab hope to launch a rocket into outer space at an amateur rocketry convention called BALLS in Black Rock, Nev.
Rocket science · The USC Rocket Propulsion Lab, where “Traveler” is currently being built, is located in the Viterbi School of Engineering at the Robert Glenn Rapp Engineering Research Laboratory. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The rocket, named “Traveler,” was designed and built by the USC Rocket Propulsion Laboratory. The rocket lab is primarily student-run; students are in charge of designing and manufacturing all of the rocket components and make all final decisions.
“The lab infrastructure is kept up by undergraduates,” Propulsion and General Fabrication Lead Jacob Hunter said.
Traveler represents the culmination of a long-standing goal to reach space since the rocket lab’s formation in 2005. To do this, the rocket will have to reach the Kármán line, 100 km above Earth’s surface.
All of the rockets designed in the lab so far have been created to test certain aspects of the Traveler. In order to test Traveler’s motor, a device called Graveler, or “Ground-Traveler,” was used to perform a static fire of Traveler’s motor.
“[Rocket] SixyBack tested a new type of nose cone and new avionics and recovery system that we designed for Traveler,” Aerodynamics Lead Brandon Edelson said.
Traveler has been undergoing improvements for about two years, with the original avionics chip and nose cone being replaced by more advanced counterparts. Recent Viterbi graduate Aaron Mitchell began working on avionics in the rocket lab his sophomore year.
“Our first avionics success, Silver Spur 3, was implemented using a tiny little chip. All it knew was how to track acceleration until it reached the peak of the flight and deployed the parachute, so after that we wanted more complex avionics for Traveler,” Mitchell said.
Now the avionics system is about the size of a toaster and has GPS, as well as multiple transmitters that can transmit data during the flight. Dan Erwin, chairman of the Department of Astronautical Engineering, sees Traveler’s success as the first step to eventually being able to carry payloads into space.
“In learning about space, a lot of observations we want to make are carried by X-rays, but the atmosphere absorbs X-rays, so all those detections must be made in space,” Erwin said.
Not only has the rocket lab achieved a lot for the university, but many members of the rocket lab also find their lab experience highly valuable when applying for jobs after college. SpaceX is one such company where many former members of the USC RPL now hold positions. The rocket lab is also a selling point for many prospective students who want to pursue astronautical engineering.
“I heard about the rocket lab when I was looking at schools. I saw all these projects going on and I really wanted to be a part of that,” Monica Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, said.
Though the rocket lab holds obvious appeal for engineering majors, anyone is welcome to join the lab, regardless of skill or major.
“Initially I was interested in projects like Traveler. They always needed hands. Now I’m helping write computer code to create operations systems,” said Spencer Brown, a junior majoring in economics. Brown is also minoring in computer science and is now able to use his minor to help the lab accomplish its goals as they become more complex.
“The code I’m helping write will start to centralize different procedures for building the rocket,” Brown said.
Senior rocket lab members teach newcomers everything they need to know and students contribute in various ways, from helping design the website to fundraising for the lab.

The Trojan Marching Band performs during halftime of the USC versus Hawai’i football game. While night had already fallen in California, the band enjoyed a nice evening in Oahu, where the timezone is three hours behind. — Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Hours before kick off, the Daily Trojan inquired the USC community about general feelings towards this football season and their expectations of the team’s performance. Students also voiced their thoughts on Thursday night away football games, especially the Hawai’i season opener. The campus was alive and full of spirit through on-campus viewing parties, despite the game occurring on a weekday.

In June, the Development Portfolio Management Group (DPMG), an organization that aims to help governments, organizations, institutions and their funders monitor projects and rescue investments from potential failure, began working within USC Dornsife’s Center for Economic and Social Research (CESR), an interdisciplinary center that researches topics in the social sciences and economics.
According to Xavier Legrain, DPMG’s director, the breakdown of success is a step-by-step process.
“We break down what we mean by quality or success into a number of key elements,” Legrain said. “We put our minds on defining those, and then rating each one of those criteria allows us to pretty accurately project how things have gone or how things will be going.”
DPMG hopes to assist development funders.
“We hope to basically help the development community do a better job. Development is not an exact science, unfortunately,” Legrain said. “A lot of mistakes have been made and a lot of money is being wasted.”
The DPMG originated in the late ’90s at the World Bank, where it was called the Quality Assurance Group (QAG). It was created in response to a report showing that the success rate of the bank’s projects was alarmingly low.
“What was basically a self-assessment method monitoring how well the projects were doing was just wildly off the mark,” Senior Advisor to DPMG Sue Berryman said. “What we needed was an independent group to come in, look at the projects, at design, as they implement it.”
When Berryman and Legrain’s colleague Arie Kapteyn moved to USC Dornsife and created the CESR, the group’s roster of 600 experts made the move as well.
“[USC] seems really businesslike. In other words, it’s practical,” Berryman said. “It has a large array of faculty in various fields. We’re working on water, on environment, on forestry, on education, health, financial management, procurement, poverty reduction — all sorts of things. So we need a very broad array of knowledge and skills.”
The group hopes to become further integrated with the USC community. This includes creating a pool of candidates for positions as junior researchers and research assistants.
“When we usually need people, we need them very quickly. In order words, we don’t have three months to spare to find the right person,” Legrain said.
Berryman recognizes the importance of working with others outside the group’s roster.
“You put 600 people together, that’s real bench strength in economic development. So we don’t really look to USC for that, but you also need up-to-date theoretical knowledge, you need up-to-date methodological skills, and these are places where USC has got some real strength,” she said.
Both Legrain and Berryman wish to emphasize the breadth of fields with which the group works to the USC community.
“What USC provides in a faster way [is] knowledge and skill to complement ours,” Berryman said. “By putting together our people and USC people, we’ve got a real powerhouse.”

Movies are unique.
Despite an assault from all sides by television, a poor economy, declining ticket sales and an over-reliance on remakes, reboots and sequels, movies still retain a unique ability to create worlds and moments you cannot see anywhere else.
In the last calendar year, we have gotten the subtle mastery of Amour and Before Midnight, the amazing visuals of Pacific Rim and Oblivion, the intensely riveting Zero Dark Thirty and Argo and the adventurous fun of Django Unchained and The World’s End.

With the budgets and resources movies have at their disposal, they can still offer a level of magic that television can only hope for. A show can develop characters and plot arcs over several hours in a season, but the art of visually telling a story in two hours and transporting the audience somewhere (or somewhen) they could never go otherwise remains exclusively cinematic. This column will strive to illuminate these things only that film can offer. That being said, this first column focuses on a casualty of the realities of the film industry.
Movie studios are smart, and movie studios want to make money. They want to make that money as quickly and efficiently as possible, so they put a lot of time and effort into how they do things. This is why you see so many sequels and remakes these days, both much safer bets than your average original screenplay. This is why you see them milking vampire and werewolf trends to the last, teenager-flocking, angsty drop. This is also why, if you happen to check which movies are coming out this Labor Day weekend, you will see a collection of formulaic action movies, uninspired comedies and one boy-band driven 3-D-concert movie. Huh?
As much as I love Ethan Hawke (starring in Getaway), Eric Bana (Closed Circuit) and Dwayne Johnson (Empire State), I will absolutely not be seeing any of their movies this weekend — and provided I’m not on the couch in front of the TV at the right time and with the correct level of lethargy, I probably never will. The worst part is the studios know that I, and most other people, will not be watching, so why put out this sorry lineup? Have they decided that money is overrated? Of course not — it’s all strategy.
Movie release dates are carefully studied and sandwiched between the stragglers of the big summer blockbusters and the carefully crafted award-hopefuls there lies an awkward few weeks of transition for which the weeks immediately following Labor Day (along with those immediately following New Year’s, after the cutoff for awards season) are flag bearers. In recent years, Labor Day has gifted us gems such as All About Steve, Disaster Movie, Balls of Fury and The Wicker Man. It’s gotten to the point where it’s not, “Why are the movies so bad this week?” but rather, “Wow, these movies must be really bad to be released this week.” The majority of movies released around this time have been unceremoniously stuffed here because the studios figure you won’t want to watch them (and what better time to do this than when people are holding on to their last bits of summer?). According to Box Office Mojo, in nine of the last 10 years, the worst weekend of the year in terms of box office money has come on Labor Day weekend or the two weeks immediately following it.
So, is all hope lost for going to the movies this weekend? Of course not. The magnificent The World’s End (the last of Edgar Wright’s brilliant so-called Cornetto Trilogy following Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz) came out last weekend and almost killed me from not letting me breathe between fits of laughter. Beyond that, the shiny Elysium and prematurely Oscar-baiting The Butler are also lingering in major theaters, while Twenty Feet From Stardom, The Way Way Back and Ain’t Them Bodies Saints play in independent ones. There are certainly good things to watch in theaters this weekend (and you could certainly find worse ways to escape the heat). Not to mention the onrushing storm of awesome movies coming our way in a few weeks when the transitionary period is over (Rush [coming Sept. 20], Don John [Sept. 27] and especially Alfonso Cuaron’s Gravity [Oct. 4] are just some of the great films coming soon). So despair not, cinephiles, there are great things coming.
Maybe it is just as well that there is this gap between the blockbusters and the ballot-stuffers. Summer is dwindling and before we know it we won’t have beach, swimming or lying in the grass weather anymore. Yes, classes have started, and everyone’s schedule has gotten much busier all of a sudden, but summer technically extends until Sept. 22. (Notice the not-so-coincidental concurrence of the beginning of fall and the debut of better movies?)
The movie studios are essentially telling us that for a couple of weeks, they are taking a break from releasing worthwhile movies. But with summer activities still in play and something as cinematically beautiful as Breaking Bad coming out with an hour of pedal-to-the-metal final-season virtuosity the next five weekends (not to mention the new and extremely engrossing The Bridge every Wednesday), maybe we should just go ahead and oblige them.

When news hit that Black Hogg in Silver Lake was opening for lunch, the food community held its breath. Black Hogg introduced Los Angeles to popcorn bacon and the buttery lamb burger, but translating such decadent foods into a lunch-appropriate package would have required unfathomable, diet-destroying mental gymnastics. So earlier this month, owners Eric Park and Jonathan Kim opened a new sandwich concept menu for lunch and separately branded it as Sopressata.
Mean ‘wich · Part-owner and manager Jonathan Kim tends the bar at Soprassata, Black Hogg’s new lunch concept that opened earlier this month. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
Sandwich lunches might seem a little out of the wheelhouse for an executive chef whose pork belly tacos were once hailed by notoriously tough Los Angeles Times food critic S. Irene Virbila as “things of beauty.” But sandwiches actually hearken back to Park’s more humble past.
“I actually owned the Togo’s outside USC for nine and a half years, so [Sopressata] started pretty seamlessly. We got things going right away,” Park said.
That was before Park attended culinary school, and before his stint at New York’s hotspot gastropub The Spotted Pig. Park returned to Los Angeles to serve up near-recklessly inventive (and equally flavorful) dishes at Black Hogg last year, and decided to try his hand at lunch by going back to his roots.
Though some of Sopressata’s sandwiches, such as the Turkey and Avocado seem partially influenced by his involvement with Togo’s, the elements and execution are on a completely different plane. Park incorporates superior ingredients at every stage of the sandwich’s creation, starting with the bread.
“The most important part of a sandwich is the bread. The bread we’re using has a good flaky crust; you bite into it, and there’s a crispy crust but eventually, it’s soft and it gives,” Park said.
“Crispy crust” is a bit of an understatement — the lustrous, almond-brown crust feels rock-solid to the touch, but upon eating, one realizes it’s not quite the enamel-crushing affair that one would find at Bay Cities Deli. Past the initial crunch, the bread almost disappears, leaving nothing but the contents of the sandwich to enjoy.
The ingredients for the Italian Meats sandwich are exactingly prepared; red onions are slivered whisper-thin, with a smattering of aged balsamic that plays low acidic notes against the rich sopressata. Fresh arugula accentuates the peppery notes, and marinated artichokes perfume the palate with the intense scent of garlic. The provolone is also a far cry from the lifeless squares and triangles at other, unnamed sub shops.
“Our cheeses are imported from Italy, so our provolone actually tastes like a cheese. There’s some funkiness and nuttiness to it,” Park said. “The fontina’s a little milder but still has a sharpness for turkey, where you want a milder cheese.”
For all its purported simplicity, Park plays inside the formal constraints of a typical sandwich to draw out intense and complex flavors. For vegetarians, there’s the Avocado Cucumber Artichoke sandwich. And for those more inclined to leaner meats, there’s a non-traditional take on the tuna sandwich.
“Everyone does tuna with a mayonnaise and pickles with relish, so I tried a tuna with olive oil and vegetables, and it’s so refreshing,” Park said. “I think it’s a better way to present tuna, especially if you have high-quality tuna.”
High-quality tuna like what could be found at Soprassata-—Park sources his tuna from line-caught, dolphin-safe tuna from American Tuna. Park says American Tuna sets itself apart from the usual Starkist canned variety by having a superior texture, which is better suited for sandwiches.
The sandwiches themselves run from $7.50 to $8.00 each, with chips and drinks costing extra. Patrons can make use of Black Hogg’s dining area, but the vast majority of Sopressata’s clientele have somewhere to be, so they phone in orders and take it to go.
As for any further menu developments, Park prefers to keep the Black Hogg and Sopressata as separate concepts.
“We’re not going to do any overlap. We want Sopressata to take on a life of its own,” Park said. “If people came here at lunchtime and saw that it was still called Black Hogg, they would come expecting something else.”
There is a bit of overlap, however — Black Hogg’s full drink menu is available at Sopressata, so diners can polish off the meal with a pint of Avery Joe’s Premium America Pilsner or a bottle of Mad River Jamaican Red Ale.
Park might have two different concepts on his hands, but it’s evident that he has a knack for finding flavor wherever he goes — as long as he doesn’t step back into a Togo’s.

Breaking down this summer’s hits and misses, there were quite a few expensive failures in Hollywood (The Lone Ranger, White House Down and R.I.P.D.) and a number of indie successes (Mud, The Way, Way Back and Blue Jasmine).
Fall preview · Lupita Young (right) stars as Patsey and Sarah Paulson (left) stars as Mistress Epps in Fox Searchlight Pictures’ 12 Years a Slave. Film offerings will turn toward more intellectual fare this fall. – Courtesy of AceShowbiz.com
One such indie, Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine, is on its way to becoming the year’s top indie at the box office, according to The Wrap.
Blue Jasmine’s success is indicative of the financial (and critical) potential for these smaller-budget films from smaller studios.
But, of course, looking at how summer movies performed is not as black and white as saying indies performed well and blockbusters flopped.
World War Z, for example, cost around $220 million to make, according to Deadline Hollywood, and was therefore expected to be a flop. Can a movie that was that expensive to make earn everything back and then some? But to everyone’s surprise, the film ended up making more than $500 million worldwide, making it Brad Pitt’s highest-grossing film yet.
There’s a bit of a gray area here when it comes to big-budget blockbusters vs. small indie darlings. Still, with major fall films coming up — The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Captain Phillips, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, etc. — it will be interesting to see how major and minor films stack up against each other.
Looking at how films performed over summer and the months ahead, the question is: In this rivalry of sorts, what can we expect for the fall?
There will be bigger films, but there will also be a surplus of films with more modest budgets from smaller studios. Four such films — all of which will open in limited release — that look promising (either critically and/or as awards contenders) are as follows:
12 Years a Slave (Oct. 18; Fox Searchlight) 
Director Steve McQueen’s (Shame) 12 Years a Slave tells the tale of Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man who was abducted and sold into slavery in the  pre-Civil War United States. The film stars A-listers Michael Fassbender, Brad Pitt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Giamatti and Quvenzhané Wallis, who was nominated last year for best actress at the Academy Awards for Beasts of the Southern Wild — she was nine years old at the time.
12 Years a Slave follows The Butler and precedes Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, indicating a trend toward racially conscious films. The Butler has done well at the box office so far — Box Office Mojo reported that the film topped the charts again this past weekend (its second weekend), pushing it past the $50 million mark.
In the wake of the George Zimmerman trial and the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech, films such as McQueen’s are as pertinent and attention-grabbing as ever.  Issues of racial difference will always be timely, and McQueen’s film, despite being set in the 1860s, is sure to raise important questions about America’s progress as a tolerant nation.
Oldboy (Nov. 27; The Film Desk)
Chan-wook Park’s Oldboy — released in 2003 — wowed critics with its mind-blowing, original narrative, stunning cinematography and captivating performances. Ten years after its original release, Spike Lee (Malcolm X, Do the Right Thing) has created a remake starring Josh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen and Samuel L. Jackson.
American remakes of foreign films are nothing new to cinema. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo (Män som hatar kvinnor; Sweden), Scent of a Woman (Profumo di donna; Italy) and The Ring (Ringu; Japan) are a few of many examples of American remakes. With these re-interpretations, there’s always the question of whether or not the remake can take existing source material and make the new film feel fresh and original. In this case, can Lee match, if not surpass, Park’s original work?
Lee has credibility as a high-profile director and has been nominated for two Academy Awards. Questions of original vs. remake aside, curiosity is piqued and foreign film lovers will inevitably line up to see if Lee can do Oldboy justice.
Dallas Buyers Club (Dec. 6; Focus)
Matthew McConaughey (Mud), Jennifer Garner (Alias, Juno) and Jared Leto (Requiem for a Dream) star in Jean-Marc Vallée’s (The Young Victoria) fight for justice for the HIV community.
The film tells the story of Ron Woodroof, a Texas electrician, who is diagnosed with HIV in 1986 and decides to pursue alternative medical treatments after an uphill battle with the medical establishment and pharmaceutical companies. His fight ended up helping to provide access to supplies for HIV-positive patients. Of course, this is all done under the table, providing the film’s conflict.
From the looks of the trailer, McConaughey’s Woodroof, a cowboy slightly reminiscent of his Killer Joe’s country twang and southern charm (though much less menacing), is dynamic and round, engaging the audience.  Leto seems an able complement as Rayon, a transgender  person who helps Woodroof sell HIV drugs on the side.
Suffice to say, engaging characters and brilliant performances will likely ensue, especially since in recent years McConaughey has stepped away from poorly done romantic comedies in favor of films such as Killer Joe, Mud, The Wolf of Wall Street and now, Dallas Buyers Club. If his track record (and Club’s stellar cast and rich narrative) is any indication, audiences are in for a treat.
Inside Llewyn Davis (Dec. 6; CBS)
Written and directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, Inside Llewyn Davis stars Oscar Isaac (Drive), Carey Mulligan (An Education) and John Goodman (Argo). It tells the story of a young singer, exploring the Greenwich Village folk scene in 1961.
Known for their eccentric writing style, the Coen brothers’ Davis will likely be a screenwriting gem full of quirky moments that infamously make the pair so unique (see Fargo’s wood chipper). Their directorial style isn’t too shabby either — from the trailer alone, one can see that Davis has a slightly dark tone about it.
Plus, it’s directed by two of the most legendary directors working today. The Coens have created masterpieces such as True Grit, The Big Lebowski, No Country for Old Men and Fargo, demonstrating their ability to adapt to genre, time period and characters.
There’s reason behind their mass following,. So here’s hoping that Davis, like its predecessors, lives up to the hype.

Earlier this month, 21-year-old Jonathan Reyes was pronounced dead from a drug overdose at the HARD Summer dance music festival at L.A.’s State Historic Park. In light of his death, it is time to re-examine the safety of all electronic dance music festivals.
Electronic dance music, or EDM, is very much alive and growing in popularity. Famed artists such as Ellie Goulding and Steve Aoki have even managed to find massive commercial success in a genre that, prior to the past few years, remained largely underground.
Those familiar with EDM festivals recognize that the genre’s events and drug use often go hand in hand. More popular shows celebrating the genre include Electric Daisy Carnival and Ultra Music Festival in Miami, which boasts hundreds of thousands of attendees.
At another incident this month during the Boomtown Fair in Hampshire, England, 18-year-old Eleanor Rowe died. Despite the ongoing toxicology reports, two people suspected of supplying the young woman with drugs were arrested soon after her death.
The most commonly used drugs at these shows include LSD, MDMA and hallucinogenic mushrooms. But what young people often don’t realize is the long-term impact that a night of dancing to their favorite DJs can have. These drugs are typically not easily accessible to young people, so many turn to distributors at shows to supply their needs. When this occurs, however, fans simply don’t know what they are getting.
Festivals and raves are usually patrolled by heavy security, but there are still those willing to take a risk with the law in order to reap financial rewards. Electric Daisy Carnival’s 2012 event drew a grand total of 300,000 people, which could mean a potential paycheck for these distributors. Dealers at EDM shows are obviously difficult to spot and almost impossible to trace in deadly cases such as Rowe’s and Reyes’.
Artists acknowledge this drug use through their own songs. Bassnectar, for example, has songs titled “Blow” and “LSD.” Popular EDM artist Pretty Lights’ best selling iTunes song is entitled “You Get High.”
So what is the solution?
Though increased security enforcement might seem obvious, that is merely a small part of the issue. The most influential step would be for these artists to encourage the use of drug-free shows and set the standard themselves. The EDM scene is only growing, so parents’ attempts to simply shut it down to achieve a solution is simply irrational.
Another rational change would be to increase medical staff at events. In many cases, such as in Eleanor Rowe’s, the medical staff can’t find victims until it is already too late for medical attention. An increase in staff would allow these attendees to be treated more quickly, minimizing the possibility of such deadly consequences.
A final step in helping control the drug use at these shows would be to ensure venue capacity is enforced. This could have been potentially life-saving in the case of Sasha Rodriguez, a 15-year-old who overdosed at EDC at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 2010. Rodriguez’s family has since made moves to sue the promoter, Insomniac Events. The family argues promoter Todd DeStefano tried to “bump up the event attendance beyond what was reasonable, and that the carnival was poorly staffed with security and emergency medical personnel.” EDC has since been moved to Las Vegas.
All in all, it is time to fix the music festival scene so that fans can have a pleasant experience instead of a fatal one.

If drugs were legal, people wouldn’t need to rely on sketchy looking strangers at raves.
We could start by regulating the aggressive campaigns of the big pharmaceutical companies.  This article seems to be just another one of these campaigns.

On Aug. 19,  a federal judge ruled that inmates in the California state prisons system can be force-fed in order to end hunger strikes. As understandable as their struggle for better amenities might be, state legislators should not have to negotiate with convicted felons.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
This particular strike was started two months ago by inmates from rival gangs who seek better living conditions in Security Housing Units, which is the California prisons’ equivalent of solitary confinement. These units house some of the most violent inmates in the state, many of whom have committed additional crimes while inside prison walls.
Since then, about 70 inmates have refused all but the most important nutrients, water and vitamins, according to the Associated Press. This stage in the strike is critical, since many will undergo serious symptoms of malnutrition within the next few weeks should the strike continue. Any actions taken by Gov. Jerry Brown, state officials and the Department of Corrections during this time can have drastic repercussions. Currently, medical care for malnourished inmates who voluntarily deprive themselves takes precedent over medical care for inmates in the general population who might actually need it.
Recent reports from the prisons paint a picture of betrayal. Yet, rather than beginning to make concessions, lawmakers ought to take a closer inspection of the finances of the California prison system. An open letter to Brown signed on behalf of more than 100 medical professionals stated that some inmates involved in the strike have been denied necessary medications, simply due to their participation. Others are on strike because of what they see as unfairly extended solitary confinement, or a lack of access to phone calls, warm clothes or education programs.
At this point, Brown and the state unions should restructure the way services are provided to the prisoners. State officials can work together to compromise on some of the demands being made. The strikes are an attempt for the incarcerated criminals to gain power in the criminal justice system. Therefore, when state officials compromise, strikes are avoided, no unnecessary benefits are given and the cost per prisoner each year does not increase.
The state of California already spends approximately $47,000 per inmate each year. According to the Legislative Analyst’s Office, a nonpartisan government agency, more than two-thirds of this total consists of security and health care. The rest? That’s set aside for education, vocational training, and substance abuse programs. It would appear that these prisoners already have a wide variety of resources available to them.
Despite the current climate surrounding the prisoners’ strike, our country has made progress in improving their policies on prisoner rights.
Whether or not these gang members realize it, they are guaranteed a certain quality of life, within reasonable penal limits. By striking, they are asking for the comforts of living which many struggle to enjoy even without having committed a serious crime.

You are right; inmates should not dictate policy – the public should through the safety net of public safety and sound criminal justice practices. Your article is somewhat vague in your position that the CDCR is overly expensive because of inmates when the truth is there are many other tangible elements that make up that cost. For example, the staffing by unionized officers – the high medical bills imposed due to lack of care in the past and now under federal review – expensive housing assignments by classification of inmates at the most expensive housing assignments – the use of private beds – the limited reforms of prison management in the past and now under federal scrutiny costing millions of dollars more than before.. the list goes on but I can assure you many of these costs were self-inflicted by the CDCR because of poor prison management issues. The inmates are taking advantage of this ride because they can by rule of law and that’s how we end up where we are today.

If there was a Mount Rushmore for USC head coaches, one could imagine Howard Jones, John McKay and Pete Carroll occupying three of the four slots. But who would have thought that the coach that might be the hardest to recognize would also be the winningest of them all: Jovan Vavic.
A family tradition · USC coach Jovan Vavic and his two children, Nikola and Monica, have led an unprecedented run of success at Troy. – Daily Trojan file photo
 
Using the word “successful” to describe the past 19 years for Vavic while in charge of USC men’s and women’s water polo programs would be an understatement. With 12 national championships combined (eight men’s and four women’s) during his tenure at USC, Vavic has the most team titles of any USC head coach in school history, which perfectly complements the 12 National Coach of the Year awards he has won.
Over this time, Vavic has solidified himself as one of the top water polo coaches in the country, accumulating a 420-64 record with the men and a 440-132 record with the women. Also, with last year’s two national championship wins, he has led both teams to national titles in the same school year four times, (1998-99, 2003-04, 2009-10).
With the men proving victorious year in and year out, Vavic has continuously had to keep his players motivated and has done so using a simple yet effective approach.
“We just really focus on each day of training at a time and believe that we are going to win every game,” Vavic said. “My coaching staff and I approach every year differently, according to our different strengths on offense and defense. I also like to differentiate some of our training sessions so it doesn’t get repetitive, while not forgetting what allowed us to get to the top.”
Jovan, however, is not the only Vavic to leave his mark on the USC water polo program; it seems the sport runs in the family.
Vavic’s son Nikola enters his senior season at USC just 48 goals away from taking over as USC’s all-time leading scorer. That should be a manageable figure, considering he set a USC record with 83 goals last season en route to being named the National Player of the Year, MPSF Conference Player of the Year and a Peter J. Cutino Award finalist.
The father-son duo led the men to a perfect 29-0 season and their fifth consecutive national championship in 2012, concluded by a 11-10 victory over crosstown rival UCLA. The 2012 team boasted a program-high nine All-Americans in all and enters 2013 as prohibitive favorites to win it all once more.
The Vavic connection does not stop there. Jovan’s daughter Monica, who is a junior, also holds her own in the family as the star of the women’s team that captured a national championship in 2013 after defeating Stanford 10-9 in a sudden death overtime thriller.
Just like her brother, Monica was decorated with postseason awards — she was named the MPSF Player of the Year as well as a Cutino Award finalist. She led the Women of Troy in scoring last season with 77 goals, tallying the third-most goals in a single season in USC history.
In all, 2012-2013 was a magical year for the Vavic trio. Over the course of the year, the men’s and women’s teams combined to post a staggering 56-1 record. The family not only swept the MPSF awards (with both men’s and women’s player of the year awards and two coach of the year awards), but boasted two Cutino finalists and two All-Americans.
Nikola and Monica also participated on their respective U.S. National Teams, while Jovan served as the interim coach for the men’s team, where he led Team USA to a FINA World Championship qualification.
When asked about the impact Vavic hoped to make on his children as their coach, Vavic’s answer was consistent with any father’s hopes for his children.
“I hope they’ve learned the value of hard work, which is one thing that I really stress,” Vavic said. “I’ve just always told them that if they work hard, good things would happened to them.”
The family’s time together at USC is soon coming to a close, though. This will be the last year the trio will be a part of the same program, as Nikola is set to graduate in the spring.
For Jovan, who has guided his children toward becoming star collegiate water polo players, nostalgia is setting in before the season has even begun.
“The time goes by really quickly so I am going to try and start enjoying it more,” Vavic said.
The Vavic trio has plans for yet another successful season in their final year together, with the goal of winning one more national championship. With Nikola and Monica both being early Cutino candidates, they could become the first brother-sister duo to win the award.
None of this, however, would be possible without the coaching of their father Jovan, who continues to build on his legacy at USC — establishing a winning tradition that dwarfs all others.
