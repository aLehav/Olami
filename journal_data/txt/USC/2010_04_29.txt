The school year is winding down, but for the new Undergraduate Student Government administration, the work is just beginning.
Heading into the final stretch of the semester, USG has begun making its summer preparations. President Chris Cheng and Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen will work on individual and joint projects this summer, and the senators will all begin planning for the onslaught of work the fall will bring.

Cheng and Ogbevoen said most of the research for their projects is done during the summer. This summer they will be meeting with administrators to present their ideas, and to get feedback and suggestions from administrators. They already have appointments set up with Michael L. Jackson, the vice president for Student Affairs, and incoming President C. L. Max Nikias.
“By talking to administrators we want to get a holistic understanding of what’s going on, what we can do, what’s feasible,” Cheng said. “It’s execution time in the fall.”
Cheng and Ogbevoen recently met with Patrick Bailey, associate dean and executive director of Student Life and Involvement, to discuss setting up meetings with various other officials.
“We’re thrilled for the opportunity to get an early start on meeting administrators and setting up our summer projects and plans for the next school year,” Ogbevoen said.
Cheng and Ogbevoen also plan to meet with Information Technology Services to discuss expanding wireless on campus and to generate ideas about how to enhance learning space and allow students to have a more innovative learning experience.
Another item on Cheng and Ogbevoen’s summer agendas is visiting recreation centers at other universities, including Stanford, Northwestern and Duke. They are hoping to use these visits to gather ideas, which will help USG push for upgrades to the Lyon Center in the fall.
“We’d like to plant the seeds for a new rec center in the future,” Cheng said. “Nothing concrete, but at least do the primary research in order to start the groundwork for something great in the future.”
USG also hopes to spend the summer spreading awareness and recruiting new members.
Ogbevoen will stay at USC through July to welcome the incoming freshmen during orientation. He plans to work at the USG orientation booth and give tours.
“We’re trying to work with the communication team and spread the word about USG as an organization, trying to get freshmen excited and possibly joining in the fall,” Ogbevoen.
Cheng and Ogbevoen are not the only ones who have summer plans. Speaker Pro Tempore Mikey Geragos said he is directing the senators to find more statistics, conduct more research and start drafting their resolutions on their projects.
“Come fall, they can come to the Senate meetings prepared so we don’t waste any time,” Geragos said. “We can start passing these resolutions and advocating for new things that we want to see on campus, and other items that we want to see the university change or fix. It’s really important that we get all of this done this summer so we can just get right into it.”
The summer will also be the time when USG orders its promotional items, moves into its new office in the campus center and plans for fall retreats, which will provide USG members with workshops and advice on how to approach advocacy projects. USG plans to move into the new office around the end of May and the beginning of June and get organized before they leave for the summer.
The senators will assist Cheng and Ogbevoen in their move to the campus center and will work with the Allocations Committee to plan for a possible increase in the budget.
The main goal this summer, Ogbevoen said, is to be prepared to jump into work when the fall semester begins.
“We’re setting up the game plan so when we get back in the fall, we hit the ground running,” Ogbevoen said.

Commencement marks the end of college for spring 2010 graduates and a day to celebrate with family and friends, but some family members might not be able to sit with their extended family for the duration of the ceremony.
For disabled family members who attend the main ceremony at Alumni Park, a disabled seating section exists in front of the stage where the attendee can only be joined by one additional family member.
According to Jeff Olsen, director of academic events at the Office of Protocol and Events, this seat restriction, though not ideal, exists because of a limited amount of space.
“It’s just one of those practical realities of space relations. No matter what, we would have to set some sort of limit. There’s just no way we could allow an unlimited number of guests in any sort of space,” Olsen said.
There are no seat reservations for the main ceremony and all seating, including disability seating, is on a first come, first served basis. For individuals who are in need of wheelchairs, there will be about 100 free wheelchairs in front of the Alumni House on commencement day.
Olsen said that Disability Services and Programs works to accommodate all family members to give them the best service possible.
“We generally don’t have many problems or complaints about the disabled seating section,” Olsen said.
Although the section is available to any family member with disabilities, it is not mandatory.
“If you want to sit with family members, you certainly can. But if you want to sit up front in the special seating section, then you can as well,” Olsen said.
Not only does the main commencement ceremony allow a disabled family member to be accompanied by just one guest, but other schools also follow the same protocol for their satellite ceremonies.
“If one person comes with a grandma in a wheelchair and there are 10 family members with them and they take up 10 seats in the section, then there wouldn’t be many seats left,” said Marissa Gonzalez, assistant director of events for Annenberg.
According to Gonzalez, students are sent an e-mail in late January informing them about making reservations for the disabled seating section. A follow-up e-mail is then sent in late March, and a confirmation is sent to each person who requested a reservation in late April.
Gonzalez said that for the three years she has been working for Annenberg’s graduation, no person who has requested disability seating or arrived at the ceremony before 10:15 a.m. has been turned away.
“Generally people understand about the seating restrictions and because people are guaranteed seating if they make reservations, a lot of people are happy and thankful that they will have a place to sit that day,” Gonzalez said.
Gonzalez said if the disabled section does become full on commencement, wheelchairs can be placed in storage and staff will escort the family member to a seat. At the end of the ceremony, staff will then bring the wheelchair back to the family member.
The Marshall School of Business, however, does not face the same restrictions as the main ceremony or Annenberg’s satellite ceremonies because Marshall’s satellite ceremony benefits from its large venue, the Galen center.
“We try to keep the families together unless there is an unusually large number of people because we know that families prefer to sit together,” said Kim West, associate dean of undergraduate programs at Marshall. “As long as students let us know, we can decrease or expand the special seating area and plan accordingly.”
West said Marshall is lucky to have such a large venue to be able to accommodate as many families as possible.
“Other schools [at USC] must make decisions about seat restrictions because the space itself is dictating what they can and cannot do,” West said.
An option might be for schools to have their satellite ceremonies on different days so larger venues can be utilized to accommodate all disabled guests and their family members, but Olsen doesn’t find this to be a simple solution.
“One of the great things about commencement is that it is one big day for the entire Trojan Family to get together and celebrate,” Olsen said. “If you break that day up, besides because of scheduling difficulties and costs, you lose that togetherness feeling that you get when everyone’s on campus.”

A group of USC students will soon be on their way to Shanghai for the long-awaited Shanghai World Expo 2010.
Beginning May 1, the expo is a chance for nations to display their impressive resources. It will host pavilions from countries around the world who will use the opportunity to present their most influential businesses and non-governmental organizations.
To prepare for the expo, the U.S. State Department decided to recruit students to represent the country and chose to ask the USC U.S.-China Institute to run the student program.
“Our selection is an indication of the global orientation of our university and the impact that the U.S.-China institute has made in its short history,” said Clayton Dube, the associate director of USC’s U.S.-China Institute. “We were a natural choice to be involved in the project.”
Students interested in becoming an ambassador had six weeks to apply, a process that included sending transcripts, letters of recommendation and an essay, and required students to have a minimum two years of Chinese language training. A national committee of evaluators considered all 599 qualified applications before selecting 160 ambassadors to attend the expo, some of whom are USC students.
Ying Jia Huang, a senior majoring in history, international relations and East Asian languages and cultures, said being an ambassador will be beneficial to her future.
“I plan to work in China for a couple years in the future and pursue graduate studies in international development, so serving as [a] U.S. student ambassador would be an insightful experience for me personally,” Huang said.
Student ambassadors will receive funds for airfare, housing and daily expenses, such as food and transportation. At the expo, students will have the opportunity to do various jobs at the U.S. pavilion, including working with government, NGO and business delegates.
“These responsibilities are heavy because most of the people the ambassadors will work with are VIPs,” Dube said.
For Huang, the most exciting thing will be experiencing many different cultures at all of the pavilions, especially China.
“At the expo, I will have the opportunity in meeting people from all walks of life, to experience firsthand the various microcosms of China’s growth,” Huang said.
The 2010 expo, promoting the theme “Better Life, Better City,” will emphasize discussion of urban issues that affect cities all over the world, such as migration, education, the environment, job creation and transportation. With a total budget of $45 billion, Shanghai was able to prepare itself sufficiently for the gathering. The city has constructed subway lines, bridges and an entire district to make room for the expo location.
The USC Thornton School of Music’s orchestra was invited to perform at the Shanghai Expo, but ultimately declined the invitation.
“The performance venue they are providing is much better for popular music concerts than a symphonic concert and we thought it would not feature the Thornton School, nor USC, in a very good light if we were to perform,” said Dean Robert Cutietta.
The Trojan Marching Band will be traveling to Shanghai to perform as part of the American performance. Multimedia will also be an important part of the expo. Conferences will be connected via satellite that link American activities to China so that an event held in the United States can be projected into the expo. These discussions will focus on anything, like issues about video gaming technology.
The United States was almost left out of the expo because sufficient funds could not be raised. Upon becoming Secretary of State, Hilary Clinton decided this was crucial for the country’s image. After receiving donations from 34 corporate sponsors, the U.S. finally committed to the event last summer.
“It would have been unimaginable for the United States to be just about the only country on Earth not to be represented in a global event of this size,” said U.S. commissioner general Jose H. Villarreal in a recent LA Times article.
Dube said the expo also represents a huge opportunity for China.
“The Shanghai Expo is really one of China’s great opportunities to demonstrate the enormous changes that have occurred there in recent decades and to show China as a major global center,” Dube said.

Never before has a group of engineers been so excited about a doll.
When Mattel Inc. announced they were giving the world the chance to vote for the next Barbie doll in the “I Can Be” series, female engineers at USC rallied together to support Computer Engineer Barbie, hoping to dispel the stereotype that engineers are usually men.
And though News Anchor Barbie won the vote of young girls, computer engineering Barbie ultimately won the popular vote, which many USC engineers say reflects the changing role of women in engineering at USC and in the professional world.
The presence of women in engineering schools and engineering professions has changed over the years; a field that was once dominated by men is now showing an increasingly large female presence.
“When I was a student in engineering, there were very few women in the program, and now there are a ton,” said Andrea Armani, an assistant professor of chemical engineering. “The overall environment has changed for me as a woman in engineering. It is much more nurturing now.”
Armani said she thinks women bring a unique viewpoint to the field of engineering, offering ways of approaching problems and viewing results that men might not have seen.
“How women and men approach research problems is very different, so it’s very important to have different opinions. They interact equally, but the guys tend to read books and plan out, whereas the girls tend to jump in and try things,” Armani said.
Still, the prevalence of men in the field has created a number of stereotypes surrounding women pursuing engineering. Though such stereotypes are well known by students at USC, most are not deterred by them and have instead chosen to fight the stereotypes.
“There is definitely a bias toward men in the engineering field,” said Kristen Hines, a sophomore majoring in industrial and systems engineering. “But that makes it more exciting to compete against the bias. Generally a stereotype of a woman engineer is that she is of Indian or Asian decent. Since almost all engineering companies are male dominated, often when women enter the work force they are looked down upon as not as intelligent. Getting respect is sometimes more challenging.”
There are many organizations on campus that serve to support women in the sciences and in engineering, such as Women In Science and Engineering and Female Undergraduates Educating and Leading in Science. These groups offer support and mentorship to their members, as well as a forum to discuss the challenges of being a woman in engineering.
Hines, who is a member of the Society of Women Engineers, said these groups help female engineers persist despite the stereotypes.
“They offer a lot of additional support and really help with alumnae relations and networking with major Fortune 500 companies,” Hines said. “I got my first internship this summer with Abbott as a manufacturing intern with SWE’s help and practice.” 
With the new Computer Engineer Barbie now for sale, both professors and students are hopeful that she will have a positive influence on young girls by introducing them to the option of engineering as a career.
“Having a Barbie character will put into the minds of girls that engineers can be females,” said Burcin Becerik, an assistant professor in the department of civil and environmental engineering. “If kids grow up knowing there’s an engineering Barbie, they will be probably more influenced to look into the field.”
Becerik said she is pleased with the way Computer Engineer Barbie turned out.
“I like the fact that the Barbie has a really beautiful figure — everything is perfect. It represents a beautiful imaged women and now there will be a beautiful engineer,” she said.

Plaintiffs of a class action lawsuit are trying to track down students who lived in the Moon residential complex from 2004 to 2007, because they might be entitled to settlement money.
BASTA Inc. filed a lawsuit against Nupac Apartments in 2007, maintaining Nupac landlords at the Moon illegally subdivided apartments. Earlier this year, Nupac agreed to pay $550,000 in settlement money, which will be split among the tenants of the Moon. Former tenants have until May 15 to file a claim to receive their part of the settlement.
“Nupac recognized that the apartment at the Moon had been illegally subdivided,” said Daniel J. Bramzon, president of BASTA Inc. and the representative of the tenants in the case. “Rather than face further regulatory repercussions, and significant financial exposure for their wrongdoings, Nupac chose to settle.”
Tyson Mansfield, who lived at the Moon when the lawsuit was filed, said he thinks the Nupac settlement is a huge victory for all USC students who have had to deal with difficult landlords.
“Everyone knows that all the landlords break the laws every day,” Mansfield, who graduated from USC in 2007, said. “You just have to know your rights.”
Mansfield said he and the other tenants decided to contact lawyers about Nupac Apartments after another resident tried to get a security deposit back.
“Then the landlord was like ‘No,’” Mansfield said. “And we thought, ‘We should call a lawyer and get everyone involved.’”
Along with security deposit and subdivision issues, Mansfield said tenants felt landlords at the Moon complex failed to keep the building up to earthquake codes and didn’t address electricity problems.
A manager at Nupac Apartments, who declined to state his name, said the lawsuit was unfounded and he did not believe the landlords illegally subdivided the apartments.
“I think we should have gone to trial because there was no merit on the case,” he said. “They should have not received a single penny.”
Mansfield said individual residents can expect to receive up to $8,000 from the settlement. Previous tenants with questions should contact BASTA Inc. or the Los Angeles County Superior Court.
Tenants who lived at the Moon between June 15, 2004, and June 15, 2007, are eligible to file for a rent rebate from the settlement. They can receive up to a 30 percent rebate on the rent paid while living at the Moon.
$8,000 is nothing when you consider how much it costs to send someone to the Moon?   I never consider there would be apartments on the Moon.  Lawyers on the other hand, likely got there first and set up shop waiting for cases to develop.  Commute must be a real bitch!

Crime in the USC area has been on the decline, but the Department of Public Safety is still hoping to address several key issues and will be discussing possible changes over the summer.
DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas said some concerns for the coming year include an increasing number of homeless people around campus and a growing number of inmates who have been released early from jail moving into the area on probation status.
DPS will continue to work with the Department of Probation & Parole to monitor early released inmates in the community, Thomas said, and it hopes to address issues of aggressive panhandling and loitering.
DPS also plans to expand the use of bike patrols in the campus community, rather than increasing vehicle patrols.
Jillian Chou, a senior majoring in international relations, said she appreciates the extra CSC security officers that DPS has provided around campus.
“I like that they have security on every corner,” Chou said. “You feel very safe walking; it’s nice knowing they are watching you off campus too.”
Thomas said DPS also hopes to take steps to decrease property theft, including encouraging students to take better care of their property and to not leave their belongings unattended.
Mallory Jebbia, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry, said she understands why the thefts are frustrating for DPS.
“DPS can’t be there to watch our stuff,” Jebbia said. “Students need to be more aware and responsible of their belongings.”
The increased number of bicycles on campus is another concern for DPS because of thefts and because bikes can obstruct access to buildings.
Additionally, DPS hopes to see a decrease in the number of alcohol overdoses by students and a decrease in the number of physical altercations involving alcohol.
DPS has been able to continue the overall reduction of crime on campus through the first quarter of 2010, Thomas said.
This year, the USC campus community was designated as a safe community by the World Health Organization.
Thomas credited this success to the use of predictive policing as a crime reduction strategy and said he hopes to expand this practice.
“[We want to] expand our use of predictive policing and crime forecasting as strategies to combat crime and address quality of life issues,” Thomas wrote in an e-mail.
Still, some students like Jake Minkley, a junior majoring in business administration, do not feel campus safety has changed.
“I don’t feel like they have reduced crime,” Minkley said. “I go to the [University Village] and I just don’t feel like it’s gotten any better.”
But Molly Abrams, an undeclared sophomore, said DPS makes her feel safe.
“I never feel unsafe; they’re everywhere,” Abrams said.
Homeless people got to eat too!
YAY. DPS will discuss issues!  Shouldn’t they be doing this throughout the year?

Summer will be anything but a break for campus political groups that are gearing up for the June primaries and November general election.
“Smart political organizations in both parties use the summer as a time to get prepared and to get organized,” said Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. “It’s important to get ready.”
The primaries for both the gubernatorial and senatorial elections will be held June 8, and the general elections will be held Nov. 2. The primaries are more important to the Republicans — neither the senatorial nor the gubernatorial race is contested on the Democrats’ side — but both the USC College Democrats and the USC College Republicans have plans to remain active this summer.
Lauren Korbatov, public relations director for the USC College Republicans, said that, although the club will not have regular meetings during the summer, its members in the L.A. area remain very active and are updated by e-mail on local political events.
Alexa Ekman, president of the USC College Republicans, said the club doesn’t normally hold any events during the summer but will this year because of the upcoming elections.
“It’s important that when people go home for the summer they can still be involved,” Ekman said. “It’s still a really hectic and busy time for everyone in charge.”
Korbatov said the USC College Republicans hope to encourage students to volunteer for the general election races and put time into supporting gubernatorial and senatorial candidates.
“We’ll try to focus on and juggle both,” Korbatov said. “It’s totally up to people who they want to get behind as individuals and who they want to support. We support all of our members even if we’re not backing the same candidates.”
Ekman added that the USC College Republicans’ focus on gubernatorial and senatorial elections would be equal.
“We don’t want to alienate any members who work with our club by focusing on one person or election,” Ekman said. “We want to help our members because it’s especially crucial this year, especially for voter turnout.”
Though the USC College Democrats don’t need to deal with picking a candidate, they still have work to do.
Schnur said it’s likely that incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) will have a much more competitive race this year than she has had in the past, especially after Sen. Scott Brown’s (R-Mass.) election in the special election in Massachusetts.
“She’s certainly still the favorite, but this will be a much more challenging race for her,” he said.
Boxer will face the winner of the Republican primary, which is currently a tight race between State Assemblyman Chuck DeVore, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and former Congressman Tom Campbell.
In the governor’s race, Attorney General Jerry Brown will more than likely get the nod from the Democrats, and will likely run against either California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner or former eBay CEO Meg Whitman.
As the USC College Democrats register students to vote, they will explain both races to them as well as why they’re both very important, according to Bobby Almeida, president of USC College Democrats.
Though the USC College Democrats don’t meet during the summer as a club, its executive members will use the time to prepare for the fall, said Aja Heisler, the club’s director of external communications.
“We’re planning a couple of events for the summer, but mostly we spend it organizing things so we can return full force in the fall,” Almeida said.
Schnur said that since there are contested primaries between elections for the Republicans and not for Democrats, this time is more important for the GOP.
“There’s a lot more at stake for Republicans,” he said.
He noted that for the USC College Republicans, this is an especially critical time.
The way students voted in the last presidential election could also influence the way students vote this year, Schnur said, adding that studies indicate the first two votes a young person casts are the leading indicator of how that individual will vote in the future.
“Two years ago, Barack Obama drew a greater level of support from voters than any candidates in any party in a long, long time,” Schnur said. “Democrats’ [Jerry] Brown and Boxer want to cement that support. Republican candidates want to try to convince young voters to switch back. Both parties understand the stakes involved with young voters.”

As students prepare to leave campus, many organizations and offices are also preparing to move, leaving their current locations for nicer digs in the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
On the move · Members of the Undergraduate Student Government will begin moving into their new office, pictured above, this summer. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
The Alumni Center, Admission Center, Undergraduate Student Government, KSCR radio station, Program Board and a number of other Student Affairs’ organizations will be packing their boxes and finally making the move to the campus center this summer. These organizations were selected to move into the campus center by a university program planning team, according to Patrick Bailey, the associate dean and executive director of Student Life and Involvement.
The move-in process will officially begin June 1, Bailey said. For more than three years, a moving committee has been collaborating with organizations to facilitate an easy and successful move. Officials will also be offering assistance to help the organizations move boxes to their new offices.
“Representatives from each area have been working together to work out the details, from how the phones and computers are transferred to getting the new university mail codes, etc.,” Bailey wrote in an e-mail. “We also are working around university programs/events to ensure a smooth transition for everyone.”
Most organizations are confident the move will be completed in time for the beginning of next semester.
“I don’t foresee any complications because I think there will be enough people here over the summer to help with the move,” said Elizabeth Trower, senior director of communications for USG. “Things would have to go drastically wrong for us to not be settled before school starts.”
Ruthie Pyles, the manager of the Admission Center, also said she thinks the move will go well, but the Admission Center is planning to be flexible in case it doesn’t.
“I’m sure [the move] will go very smoothly, but with any sort of construction, there are always things that may arise, and we are planning to be as flexible as possible,” Pyles said. “I have every faith and confidence that all the main departments will be in and ready to go when students come back.”
Some groups are struggling with their preparations for the move, however.
To get ready for the move, Program Board has had to sort through its belongings and decide what is important and what’s not.
“From what I’ve heard, there’s not a lot of storage space in the campus center,” Richie Pizano, executive director of Program Board,  said. “The Program Board office is flooded [with things], so we’ve been very selective with what we pack up and what we store in different storage areas.”
Karl Nickenig, next year’s general manager of KSCR radio, said KSCR is in the process of deciding what should be moved to the new office in the campus center.
“I know the new space will have its own furniture, so our staff has to decide what we need and what we don’t in the coming weeks,” Nickenig said.
Even once these offices and groups are comfortably settled in the campus center, their current offices will not be entirely abandoned.
According to Bailey, there are multiple administrative groups that review available space on campus and then determine which organizations will best utilize that space.
“They look at short-term/long-term needs, student and academic needs, service and operational needs, etc.,” Bailey wrote. “At USC space is a very precious thing, that’s why we worked hard to develop/create space that can serve multiple functions in the campus center.”
So far, administrators have decided that the current USG office, located in the Student Union, will become the new Orientation Programs office. The future of the current Admission Center, located in Trojan Hall, has not yet been decided.
The Epstein Family Alumni Center in the campus center will house about 24 members of the Alumni Association, but the university’s oldest building, the Widney Alumni House will not be deserted.
“The Alumni House will remain a part of the alumni footprint of the university,” said Patrick Auerbach, executive director of alumni relations. “It will become a welcome center for alumni, whereas the office in the campus center will become a headquarters and place where our volunteer leadership will come to campus.”
Other organizations moving into the campus center include Academic Recognition Programs, the Volunteer Center, the Office of Campus Activities, the Graduate and Professional Student Senate, Leadership Programs, the SCheduling Office and Campus Center Administration.

USC Students plan to demonstrate in front of Tommy Trojan between noon and 2 p.m. Thursday, speaking out against a new Arizona law they say legalizes racial profiling.
The demonstration is a grassroots collaboration among students from various campus organizations, including Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano/a de Aztlan de USC, the Latino Student Assembly, Chicanos for Progressive Education, Hermanos Unidos and Hermanas Unidas.
Arizona’s law, SB 1070, makes it a state misdemeanor to be in the United States illegally, which previously was only a crime under federal statutes. The new state law requires local law enforcement officers to determine the immigration status of people reasonably suspected to be in the country illegally. Though the law bans using race or ethnicity as the only reason for suspicion, opponents say it considers a group of people, based in part on their ethnicity, guilty until they prove themselves innocent.
“We need to have some action out there to say students at USC are not OK with this,” said, Luis Garcia Rico, a junior majoring in political science and American studies.
Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said the law, which will not go into effect until late summer, will untie the hands of police officers in a state that has more illegal border crossings than any other. She said the quality of the state’s public services has decreased because of illegal immigration, and Congress has been slow in revamping immigration laws.
Attendees at Thursday’s demonstration will be encouraged to fill out cards pledging their opposition to the law that will be sent to Brewer. Organizers did not disclose further details of the demonstration because they wanted to provide some surprises, but Juan Espinoza, one of the organizers of the protest, said to expect student speakers and other students posing in handcuffs.
“We want to demonstrate in a way that is intellectually entwined and visually appealing so that it sends a message that what Arizona is doing is not right,” said Espinoza, a sophomore majoring in international relations and communication.
The demonstration will be one of the first efforts at USC to press for reform of federal illegal immigration policy. Rico said the demonstration is aimed at showing solidarity and providing education.
“It’ll be a peaceful and organized protest because we don’t want this to be the end of the activism around this issue,” Rico said. “There’ll be moments where we get loud and rowdy, and there’ll be moments where we are more reserved.”
Rico said he could not guess how many students would attend, but about 570 students are listed as confirmed guests on the event’s Facebook page as of Wednesday evening.
“I’ve taught myself not to get too excited, but I’m expecting a very good turnout,” he said.
Emily Brooke, a freshman majoring in sociology, said she hopes there will be a greater sense of awareness on campus about the Arizona statute after the event.
“I’m hoping it lets the greater USC community know about the law and how we can go about getting it repealed and achieving more comprehensive immigration laws on the federal level rather than going state by state,” she said.
Rico said educational efforts would continue in the fall, with an attempt to bring a human angle to the debate.
People across the country have begun to boycott businesses in Arizona and have stopped traveling to the state. A Phoenix resident is attempting to collect enough signatures to place the issue on the November ballot for state voters to decide, and civil rights attorneys already plan to challenge the law in court.
“I doubt this law will ever be enforced because milder laws have been declared unconstitutional before,” said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, an associate professor of Chicano studies at UCLA.
He said the boycotts from people in California and Mexico would have a massive impact on Arizona’s economy this summer. If the law is allowed to stand, Hinojosa-Ojeda said, it would be devastating for a state whose economy is so reliant on undocumented immigrants.
Espinoza said students must use their voice to protect these individuals.
“This is about stopping injustices against all the communities that are racially profiled against,” Espinoza said. “These people have no voice, so we as students will stand up for them.”
Kristin Inouye, a senior majoring in electrical engineering, said she would watch some of the demonstration.
“It’s definitely a really big deal, and it’s great to see people showing their support in California because even though it’s not Arizona, it still really means a lot,” she said.

It’s Thursday, and students have switched into weekend mode. They’re ready to let loose and forget about a week filled with a variety of classes, exams, work and myriad other activities.
But a fun night out for some students could mean a late night for community members, and now university leaders are working on a plan they hope will help establish better understanding among students and community members.
“When you’re having a party, you don’t think of ‘Frank’ across the street who has to get up for work,” said Shawn Simons, president of the North Area Neighborhood Development Council. “If there was more integration in the community to acknowledge each other, there would be more respect.”
The university and community groups have been actively trying to find a solution for the past few years, but many people say there is still a lot of work to be done.
In spring 2007, the USC Office of Civic and Community Relations formed a Student-Community Relations Task Group to open a dialogue between university officials, landlords and community members about noise and student behavior in the community.
The task force, which met monthly and lasted for about a year, came up with 20 recommendations for university action the group compiled into a report.
One of the recommendations was for the university and community members to offer incoming students tours of the neighborhood. Officials are currently working on implementing this idea for this summer’s orientation sessions.
“Every year when the students have the welcome back week, we [would] do the tour,” said Kristen Soares, senior associate vice president of government relations for the USC Office of Community for Government Relations.
Such a program could be useful in helping to educate incoming students and reminding them to be courteous of their neighbors.
“There is a new group to be educated every year,” Department of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle said. “It takes a while for them to understand the rules of conduct.”
Some students said they think parties have been going on for so long that students don’t realize they live in the neighborhood too.
“I’ve never heard of a party where someone was like, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t have this because of the people in the community,’” said Brian Nathan, a sophomore majoring in accounting.
Kaleena Patel, a sophomore majoring in biology, agreed.
“Parties have been going on for so many years on Thursday nights that I don’t think students really take their surrounding area into account,” Patel said.
But some students think such a program could be useful.
Luis Ramirez, a freshman majoring in fine arts, said,  “They would be more respectful, but I don’t think that if they were informed beforehand they would party less.”
The university is also working to hold landlords accountable, not just students.
Soares noted that many landlords in the North University Park Area do not live in the buildings, so often they are not there when community members or others call with noise complaints.
Maggi Fajnor, a USC graduate and member of the task force group, said the suggestions she’s made are for more property owners to be placed on location, stricter standards for the residences and an on-call number community members or even students can call.
Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president of USC real estate and asset management, said her office is starting to work on a website that will allow students to comment on the management of apartments in the area. For landlords to be featured on the website, she said they must have a 24-hour phone line and abide by university partying policies.
Although the website is focused on helping students and parents find trustworthy landlords in the area, she said community members will benefit too.
“It kind of forces [landlords] to not be absent if they are on that website,” Raspe said.
University officials and community members agree students and community members will have to work together and integrate to remedy loud noise in the North University Park Area.
“All we can do is really figure out how we can best be respectful of each other,” Simons said.
@Thite
I’d rather USC whiteflighted it out of here rather than argue about who was here first. Just imagine if SC’s campus traded spots with Pepperdine?
LMAO. They were here before you guys and they’ll be around after. Sorry but they belong here a heluva lot more than you guys do.
I agree with Thite. While I do see their point and feel a tad sorry for them they have to realize where they bought their place at and realize it’s right next to a college. No excuses.
Maybe these “community people” should have noticed the 235 acre campus just south of Jefferson before they moved in.    Last time I looked, USC was here long before they were.  I have to listen to the mariachi music and smell burnt corn tortillas daily.    Maybe they need a tour of my lifestyle?
I suggest that the tours be conducted by members of the community.

After a year of searching, the Thornton School of Music has finally found a suitable space for its practice rooms — the new University Gateway apartment complex.
Playing along · Jung Won Kong, a doctoral student studying piano performance, practices in a music practice room in the PIC building, which is set to be demolished at the end of the school year. - Roland Wiryawan | Daily Trojan 
Thornton’s practice rooms are currently housed in the Music Practice and Instructional Center, which the university plans to demolish. Administrators started looking for an alternative location at the beginning of the school year and announced in November that the practice rooms would move to the Von KleinSmid Center Library. But after students and faculty petitioned to save the library, administrators revoked the decision, leaving Thornton without practice space.
Almost six months later, Thornton finally has a plan, though it is still awaiting final approval, Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta said.
The former cinematic arts building will be gutted and renovated to become the jazz department, instructional rooms, student service offices and group rehearsal spaces, totaling 40 percent of Thornton’s space needs. The rest of Thornton — outreach offices, the early music program and all of the practices rooms — will move to Gateway.
“This took longer than any of us could have ever dreamt,” Cutietta said. “It’ll be a different school for everyone in the fall.”
Gateway, located at the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Figueroa Street, will provide more practice rooms than students currently have, but the location is not ideal, Cutietta said.
Still, Cutietta said Gateway will be a significant upgrade.
“I’m excited to be out of PIC,” he said. “It’s a lousy building.”
Although some students like the central location of PIC, many agree the music school needed an upgrade.
“I hope it’s an improvement,” said Jonathan Richards, a senior majoring in double bass performance. “We definitely need new facilities.”
Gateway will provide 24-hour access to practice rooms for music students with secured, key card access, a crucial part of the plan, Cutietta said. Practice rooms are for music students only, but currently doors in PIC are always open, which grants anyone — non-music majors and non-USC students — access to the facility.
But there is certainly a downside to the proposed plan.
“I do feel bad that students have to walk all the way over to Gateway,” Cutietta said.
Some students said they feel the new practice rooms in Gateway will not be worth the hassle it will take to transport their instruments and themselves off campus.
“How are we really going to get the most out of it, if it’s where it is?” said Colleen Gilligan, a freshman majoring in jazz studies who worries about carrying her large bass to and from Gateway.
Marcus Paul, a freshman majoring in jazz studies, said he much prefers PIC’s location — right next to the intramural field.
“If anything, I think [PIC] should be renovated and given back to us,” Paul said.
Cutietta noted that all instructional facilities will be close together under the new plan, like a small campus solely for the music school.
“We’re creating a whole performing arts neighborhood,” Cutietta said.
Some music school spaces — such as offices and recording studios — have already moved into former buildings of the USC School of Cinematic Arts.
“As they’re moving out, we’ve been taking over things,” Cutietta said.
Although the whole move will be a quick turnaround, Cutietta said, the ideal finish date in August has already been pushed back. The move will take place over the span of three days during a weekend in September, but students will never be without practice facilities.
“Anything we can find available for that weekend, we will open up,” said Cutietta, who said he would offer his personal office space for students to practice, if need be.
The doors in PIC are NOT always open (they require a key card after 8 PM). Also, I really resent the attitude expressed in this article that only official music majors have a right to use the practice rooms. A few weeks ago, the custodian in PIC tried to kick our a cappella group (which contains multiple music majors and minors) out of the large practice room on the grounds that it was for “legit music students only”…does being a “legit,” university-recognized student music group not count?

As President Steven B. Sample prepares to deliver his final speech as USC’s president, top administrators are anxious to see what incoming President C. L. Max Nikias will bring to the table.
In August, Sample will officially pass the torch to Nikias, who was unanimously chosen by the Board of Trustees to be the university’s next president.
Ready to go · University administrators have high hopes for incoming President C. L. Max Nikias, who takes over at the end of the summer. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
Sample is leaving behind an impressive legacy. During his 19-year tenure, the quality of education and of student life at USC improved by leaps and bounds. The school shot up in the national rankings, the endowment grew significantly and USC’s presence increased around the country and world.
“He’s the man who came in 19 years ago and really communicated to the Trojan family, really made the Trojan family believe that not only they were good but they could become excellent,” Nikias said. “He’s the one that has shown the Trojan family that there are so many possibilities, that we could excel.”
But top administrators say they are confident the university’s growth won’t end with Sample, and many, including Sample himself, say there is a lot of work to be done.
“I’m never satisfied, that’s not my nature, but we’ve made enormous strides,” Sample said during a November interview with the Daily Trojan. “We still have lots of room to get better.”
The university Nikias will take charge of in August is an entirely different school from the one Sample entered almost two decades ago. USC does not need a dramatic transformation — it has already become an elite university — but the school can still grow and many have high hopes for the future.
Sample said he thinks Nikias could make great strides in research rankings and in recruiting the best Ph.D. students. Michael Jackson, vice president for Student Affairs, hopes Nikias will continue the transformation into a true residential university; Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers wants to see USC’s interdisciplinary focus continue to grow; and Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis Yortsos thinks it’s important that USC continue trying to up the ante.
“We need to continue on the path toward converting our residences to residential colleges where we have faculty families and students,” Jackson said. “We also need to renew our opportunities for students to participate in recreational programs and to improve the Lyon Center.”
Jackson said he also sees opportunities for development in online education and noted that the endowment could still be larger.
Yortsos said Nikias should build on Sample’s success.
“Max’s challenge will be not only to solidify USC’s position where it is now but hit the next level because there’s always a next level,” he said.
USC can reach this next level, Yortsos said, by being part of the next big thing.
“For instance, take the next Google that will come, whatever that is,” Yortsos said. “It would be very important for the school that its name be associated with the next big thing.”
Of all these goals, Nikias will perhaps be best prepared to tackle USC’s transformation into a residential university, with the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center set to open in the fall.
“[The campus center] is a physical construction that makes a big statement of how far the university has come in residential life and having first-class physical infrastructure,” Nikias said. “The campus center coming up is going to allow us to make the campus more residential on weekends.  We’re making this more residential on weekends. When we talk about a residential university it isn’t just residential four or five days, it should be 24/7.”
The campus center is a huge step toward transforming the campus atmosphere, Jackson said, and it offers Nikias a great chance to continue developing campus life.
Nikias plans to start his tenure by launching a new fundraising campaign to help increase the school’s endowment, which is still relatively low given the number of students at the university. His initial focus also includes improving the quality of USC’s research, its Ph.D. students and the Health Sciences Campus.
Administrators said they are confident this summer’s transition will be smooth and say they are excited to see the university move forward under Nikias.
“We’re all going to be in exceptionally good hands moving forward,” Bickers said. “Their missions are very much in tune.”
“We’re excited,” Jackson said. “We’re sad to see President Sample go and clearly we celebrate his achievements and all that he’s done for us collectively and individually, [but] we’re excited to rally around Max Nikias.”
Nikias said he is humbled to follow in the footsteps of his mentor and is exited for the challenges that lie ahead.
“I feel very fortunate that I have worked so closely with [Sample], he’s been a great mentor to me and in many ways I learned from the master. And I feel that perhaps I’m one of the luckiest people in the area of higher education because not too many people would have had the opportunity that I did, not only to be part of the ride of the USC ascent but also to have the opportunity to work closely with President Sample,” Nikias said. “That is priceless.”
Kudos to President Sample for such an astonishing run.  I’m sure Nikias is going to continue the transformation.  As an alumus, I suggest setting new ambitious goals in the following areas: research dollars, endowment, prestige of PhD. programs, increased yield rate for freshman, and unprecedented growth of international presence.   We should strive to become the world’s first truly international research institution of higher learning.  How cool would that be?  It’s good to be a Trojan!
Make it happen, Nikias. We believe in you and USC.

Parts of campus were evacuated for more than an hour midafternoon Wednesday in response to a bomb threat at Leavey Library.
Although no explosive device was found and officials said the threat was a hoax, a Los Angeles Police Department media representative said the situation was still being investigated.
Evacuated · Officers from LAPD and USC’s Department of Public safety congregate on McCarthy Quad to discuss the situation. Authorities evacuated Leavey Library and closed parts of campus after a caller claimed there was a suspicious package in the library. - Justin Bettman | Daily Trojan 
USC’s Department of Public Safety was notified at 12:35 p.m. by LAPD that a call had been made to the LAPD 911 call center, DPS Capt. David Carlisle said.
“The caller claimed that there was a suspicious package in Leavey Library, insinuating that it may be some kind of explosive device,” Carlisle said.
DPS and LAPD officers then responded to the scene to evacuate the building and wait for the bomb squad to arrive.
Carlisle later confirmed that LAPD had traced the origin of the call, and the Los Angeles Times reported that the call was made from the psychiatric ward of the USC University Hospital.
Students who were in Leavey at the time said an announcement was made over the library intercom, but many said the announcement was hard to hear. Many said they only knew something was going on when DPS officers began to evacuate the library.
“The authorities came in and said it was an emergency and everyone needed to get out,” said Rucha Sharma, a graduate student studying computer science. “We didn’t know what was happening. We weren’t scared, but since it’s exam time, the library was full. People on the top floors were moving fast to get out — some people started running.”
Grant Murphy, a freshman majoring in business administration, was sitting outside Leavey when DPS and LAPD showed up.
“They started pulling people out of the building, but I guess they weren’t getting people out fast enough,” Murphy said. “The fire alarms went off and people came out faster.”
Many students said they had no idea what was happening at the time.
“The security guard came, but no one told me anything,” said Kelly Li, a freshman majoring in biological sciences who works at the circulation desk of Leavey. “Five minutes later, my boss told me to get out of the library, so I did.”
Once outside, DPS officers sectioned off the area immediately in front of the library and evacuated the north side of McCarthy Quad. Although the majority of campus remained open, some areas were closed, including 34th Street between Watt Way and Figueroa Street. These closures meant that some students had to find alternate routes to campus.
“It’s a little silly that not everyone on campus knows,” said Cassie Nickols, a graduate student studying piano performance who had difficulty getting on campus, at the time. “I don’t know how fast [Trojan Alert] is supposed to be. They seem to be keeping people off campus, but there are students still on campus.
Though some students were annoyed by the disruptions caused by the threat — especially because it is the final week of classes — most said they think the precaution was necessary.
“This is more important than examinations. If there is a bomb scare, that has a higher priority than preparing for an exam,” said Ankit Maheshwari, a graduate student studying computer science. “You can always study later.”
Campus activity returned to normal shortly after 2 p.m., when the police tape was taken down and students and staff were allowed to return to the restricted areas.
Although nothing was found in the library, Carlisle said DPS treats every threat as legitimate in order to ensure the safety of the university.
“We have to take these threats seriously,” Carlisle said. “We proceed as if there really is an explosive device or other suspicious package in the library that could cause significant injury and damage to property. So, as disruptive as it is, it is a necessary precaution we must take.”

Even though I am signed up to Trojan Alert and do normally recieve them (live overseas) in this case I did not!
Only found out what had happened through LA Times Alert!!!
@A Parent – You know that Trojans Alert exists and you would like to be alerted of emergency situations. Yet you haven’t “activated TrojanAlert [sic]”… Really?
As a staff member and grad student, I received text messages from Trojan Alert which was good enough for me.to stay clear of the area and explain the street closures and the television helicopters in the sky. I am not sure a wide broadcast as on the web or an alarm is helpful as it may alert the perpetrators to advance their plans. I also subscribe to a similar service for the University of the Pacific where my daughter attends and was notified of a similar situation,
Why wasn’t the USC website updated during this event?  After receiving a phone call from my child, I went directly to the website- nothing!  Although there is a “Safety/Emergency” tab, that page was not updated.  In fact, the page read: “No Current Emergency Situation.”  Really?  For parents who may not have activated TrojanAlert, the website is an important source of information.  Next time, please keep the parents informed.
