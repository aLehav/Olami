It’s Saturday evening and the Serrano family is running down the field, exchanging a soccer ball from one player to another.
The family cheers and claps as Ruth Serrano, a seventh-grader at 32nd School/USC MaST K-8 School, kicks the ball with force. The goalie dives, arms spread out, but misses the ball.

Ruth’s older brother, Fernando, gives her a double high-five. It’s now her turn to play goalie.
The Serrano family hails from the Pico-Union area but visits USC regularly to play soccer and spend time together under the lights of Cromwell Field. The field, they say, is a great asset to the community even though it is part of USC’s campus.
“It helps out a lot of the community because there are no actual parks around here where the community can actually go and have activity time without having any problems,” Fernando said.
The Serranos aren’t the only local residents who come to USC to use the track.
The track and field has its seasonal uses, offering practice space for the Trojan Marching Band in the fall and various club sports practices throughout the year. But there are also those who come out daily dressed in sweatsuits from head to toe to power walk and run. And then there are those who work on their soccer headbutts or spiral football throw. There are the sports teams, like the USC men’s lacrosse team and the L.A. United Track Club, a youth club that uses the space to practice. There’s even the small child who uses the sandpit as his personal sandbox.
Fernando said the space is well known around the local community; many of his friends utilize the space to play soccer on a weekly basis.
Ruth, an active football, basketball and soccer player, said her middle school also comes to the track once every other week to do a 30-minute run and occasionally a timed mile run.
The youngest of the Serranos, third-grader Daniel, said soccer is his favorite sport. Daniel runs alongside his father, receives, guards and kicks the ball. He said he learns more about the sport from his family every time the Serranos come out to play.
The track gives families like the Serranos the chance to connect with each other, but it can also give students a chance to connect with members of the local community.
Kevin Chou, a junior majoring in music who goes to the track at least three times a week, said he sometimes takes advantage of the different activities happening around him on the track.
“I talk to some of the people and if I see some people throwing the ball I ask them, ‘Hey are you guys going to start a game?’ Sometimes they say yes,” Chou said.
Chou said local community members have also asked him to start up a football game.
He noted, however, that it rarely happens that both groups actually come together and interact.
“It’s almost like we’re doing our own thing,” he said.
But Robert Medina, the enrollment and scholarship officer for USC Army ROTC who regularly comes out to the track and also has an office in the Physical Education Building that overlooks the bright green Astroturf and eight lanes of rubber, mentioned that the space is very unique within the local area.
“I quickly noticed that Cromwell Field was a very dynamic gathering place at night,” he wrote in an e-mail. “It’s a great service to the L.A. community.”
Those who use it are under careful watch of a Department of Public Safety Community Service officer.
The officer serves the Cromwell Field from 5 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
Despite the amount of activity, Carlisle said there are rarely any issues.
“If the lacrosse team has an official practice and another group wants to play soccer on the field at the same time, the [community service officer] has access to who is entitled to use the field at that time,” he wrote in an e-mail. “Generally speaking though, there are few problems at the Cromwell Field.”
Fernando also emphasized the safety of the area and said it’s a nice place for his younger brother and sister to stay active.
“It’s a safe environment, and you can actually have some fun,” he said.

Universities nationwide are grappling with how to balance the male to female ratio as the number of female applicants grows faster than that of males, but the trend does not seem to have reached USC and experts speculate there are a number of reasons why.
“What we’re seeing right now is a trend of higher numbers of females applying and enrolling, with over 60 percent enrolling in higher education. The percentage of men is much lower,” said Dr. Tatiana Melguizo, an assistant professor at the Rossier School of Education.
At USC, this year’s admitted class is 46 percent male and 54 percent female — far more balanced than the national average. Tim Brunold, director of undergraduate admission, said the balance of students admitted reflects a balanced applicant pool.
“Usually, the percentage points don’t vary much between applicants and admitted students,” he said.
Brunold said USC’s percentages have been fairly constant for the last couple of years.
He said he thinks the university might have escaped the national trend because of the strengths of the USC course offerings.
“We have such a range of programs, it’s very easy to see there are certain academic disciplines that lean toward one gender or another,” he said. “But here, with the size we are and the number of programs we offer, any imbalance that is affected by these factors is mitigated.”
Melguizo noted that a number of factors distinct to USC might be contributing to USC’s anomalous percentages.
“USC might be giving a premium to low income students of color,” Melguizo said, noting that the two groups that are the “most vulnerable” are black males and Latino males.
The strength of USC’s science and engineering programs might also play a role, Melguizo said. She noted that if this is the case, it might not be a positive thing.
“The other thing to consider is that we have strong science programs and a number of students who want to major in those are male,” she said. “Males are overrepresented and the females are underrepresented. This might mean we aren’t making the effort we need to be making to recruit females at the undergraduate level. This might not be such an encouraging story gender-wise,” she said.
Bilawal Sidhu, a freshman majoring in computer science and business administration, said there is a significantly lower percentage of female students in his computer science class.
“There are maybe six or seven women in a full lecture hall, which is like 50 students,” Sidhu said.
Brian Bechtel an undeclared freshman, has also observed that certain courses tend more toward one gender or another.
“My sociology class, I would say, looks like it’s maybe 50/50, but in my econ class it’s more guys,” he said.
Brunold emphasized that the admissions office does not currently factor gender into the decisions process.
“We know the gender of an applicant, but it does not factor into the decision. We certainly do pay attention — if we ever saw a trend toward a troubling imbalance, then we might reconsider how we look at gender,” he said. “But we have not yet been faced with that problem. We are looking for the students who will be most successful in their intended discipline.”

Experts spoke at a panel Tuesday night about what the health care reform and student aid bill will actually mean for students, addressing students’ concerns and trying to clear up misconceptions.
Explain away · Vivek Gupta (center) of USC’s Keck School of Medicine helps students understand the effects of the health care bill. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan 
The forum, hosted by the California Public Interest Research Group, featured panelists Michael Russo, CalPIRG health care advocate and staff attorney; Paresh Dave, a freshman majoring in print journalism; and Harut Hovsepyan and Vivek Gupta of the Keck School of Medicine. Dave is also a staff member at the Daily Trojan.
The panelists spent the hour-long event discussing what changes the reform bill will make and how students will be affected.
“We thought it was very important because there has been a lot of controversy regarding the bill, but one topic of conversation that has been lacking is what the bill is actually doing to help students,” said David Mittelstein, USC CalPIRG health care coordinator and panel moderator.
The panelists discussed ways that health care reform can positively affect students.
“Right now, even though you may not know it, when you hit age 19 or graduate college you can no longer be on your parents’ insurance policy,” Russo said. “But under the bill, insurance companies must let students stay on their parents’ plan [through] the age of 26, so that they don’t end up uninsured.”
Russo pointed out that with the new bill Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because of pre-existing conditions.
The bill will also take away many of the current restrictions on Medicaid and allow wider access to the program.
“They are expecting that in the future, one-third of young people who are uninsured will be able to get Medicaid,” Gupta said.
Students expressed concern about how these changes will affect health care providers.
“What does this mean for doctors? I am pre-med, and I’m wondering if doctors will make the same salaries as in the past,” said Danny Lee, a freshman majoring in biochemistry.
Panelists emphasized, however, that the changes should not drastically affect those employed in the health care field.
“In terms of the overall salary and economics of the medical profession, the bill doesn’t change anything drastically,” Russo said. “It changes how doctors are getting paid, but not necessarily the amounts.”
He said the new system will encourage more doctors to become primary care givers rather than specialists because America currently has an overabundance of specialized doctors and not enough standard physicians.
Students also seemed worried about the negative impact from reform protestors.
Alex Silkin, a freshman majoring in business administration, inquired as to whether the bill can be effective with so much opposition.
Gupta and Russo explained that although some opposition groups plan to take cases to the Supreme Court against the health care bill, they don’t think this is a major concern.
“I don’t think any of the cases would hold up in court,” Russo said. “But this opposition is disheartening and could be threatening to the bill’s public image.”
Panelists also discussed the myriad misconceptions about the bill.
“The opposition says that it’s a fiscally irresponsible bill, which will make costs go up,” Russo said. “But actually, it will cut the budget deficit significantly over the next few decades and also put some downward pressure on insurance premiums.”
Hovsepyan shared another common misunderstanding about the bill.
“Some people think this is a government overhaul of health care,” Hovsepyan said. “But it’s not. The government will regulate it, but the insurers will still be private companies.”
During the second half of the discussion, panelists explained the basics of the Student Financial Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (SAFRA). One of SAFRA’s main provisions is eliminating bank-funded student loans and allowing direct government lending.
Students seemed confused with this new system and whether or not it would change the loan application process, but panelists emphasized that students won’t notice much of a difference.
Students felt that hearing the panelists directly address these common misconceptions was very helpful.
“This discussion definitely clarified some things,” said Buck Mower, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “I think it’s important that we continue talking about health care reform.”
Yvette Ferrer, the CalPIRG USC chapter chair, agreed.
“It was exceptionally helpful to hear exactly what the bill entailed and also what it meant for medical students,” Ferrer said.
Mittelstein anticipated about 30 to 40 attendees, but attendance was significantly lower. Mittelstein noted, however, that this allowed for more audience participation.
“The people who were here were very interested, and they were able to ask a lot of questions,” Mittelstein said. “I think it went well.”

USC professor Estela Bensimon was recognized this weekend with the University of Wisconsin school system’s award given annually to women who make significant contributions to education. She is the first person from outside Wisconsin to receive the honor.
“I can’t explain how profound an affect she has had on all our campuses,” said Helen Klebesadel, director of the Women’s Studies Consortium within the University of Wisconsin system.
The 2010 Outstanding Women of Color in Education Award was given to Bensimon in recognition of the “equity scorecard” she created. The scorecard maps an individual school’s racial and ethnic data. The scorecard then looks at statistical gaps and provides strategies for a specific campus to increase minority graduation rates, according to Bensimon.
“We have created the tools to help colleges be much more intentional in planning where they need to be in the future,” Bensimon said.
Bensimon, who came to USC in 1995, served as the associate dean for USC’s Rossier School of Education from 1996-2000. When she stepped down in 2000, she created the Center for Urban Education with the goal of creating diversity in higher education.
“It’s not only important to bring minorities into college, but also graduate them in proportions equal to their representation in colleges or to the graduation rate of all other students,” Bensimon said.
Co-worker Sandra Luca, a research associate at USC’s Rossier School of Education, said Bensimon’s character, in addition to her work, makes her deserving of the award.
“She just has this unyielding commitment to making things better and to really focus on some of the racial inequities that are still very much present in this country,” Luca said.
When Bensimon spoke about her research at a conference a few years ago, she was approached by the vice president of the Wisconsin school system about using the scorecard in Wisconsin. Bensimon said she was skeptical of Wisconsin’s involvement initially.
“It would require them to invest substantial resources but they were very methodical about it,” she said. “It takes a certain amount of courage to look at your data because you have to desegregate everything by race and ethnicity but the university did, willingly.”
Bensimon and her team worked with all but two of the campuses in the 16-school University of Wisconsin system. Other schools in states like Nevada and Pennsylvania are also in talks to use Bensimon’s scorecard in the future.
Her work with the CUE Equity Model has been mentioned in the Harvard Education Review and other publications. The center has received funding from the National Science, Forbes and Lumina foundations, among other public and private organizations, like the University of Wisconsin.
Bensimon said she is grateful to USC for the opportunities it has afforded her.
“USC made it possible for me to be a little out of the box,” she said. “It’s a little risky, it’s doing research in a manner that’s different than social science. It’s controversial.”
Although Bensimon was the first out-of-state recipient, Klebesadel said the choice wasn’t hard.
“I work every day with the people who are using her research on our campuses,” she said. “They are using the most profound tool. There are a lot of good ideas, but there are not a lot of good ideas also grounded in evidence.”
Luca said Bensimon’s impact extends far beyond her research.
“This is just one piece of what Dr. Bensimon does; she’s a professor and researcher but also a mentor to a lot of people,” she said.

Ten practices into the 15-practice spring football schedule, coach Lane Kiffin decided that his players needed an opportunity to display their energy and enthusiasm after two days off. Therefore, the Trojans practiced the most exciting situation in football — the goal-line set.
Standout · Senior running back Allen Bradford was the star of Tuesday’s goal line drill, often pounding the ball into the end zone. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
With hip-hop music blasting, the offense was lined up two yards away from the goal line. When the offense scored, the unit mobbed the ball-carrier and taunted the defense. When the defense made a goal-line stand, the group retuned the favor.
“We tried to create an energetic atmosphere because that is what the goal line is,” Kiffin said. “We are going to go up to places that are loud, and we are going to have to focus. We created an environment that the players are most likely going to [face] in a game. That’s the only way I know to practice goal line.”
At one point, all of the players circled around Kiffin and took a knee, and practice appeared to be over. However, sophomore linebacker Devon Kennard did not want to end the practice with the defense losing the drill, so he stood up and yelled “Let’s do more,” and Kiffin complied.
“That shows a lot of leadership,” Kiffin said. “We look for guys that don’t accept losing and want to keep fighting.”
—
Redshirt freshman James Boyd, who was moved from defensive end to quarterback earlier in the spring, threw his first pass.
“I was excited just to get it out of the way, so I am prepared for the next one,” Boyd said.
Boyd, who had a knee sprain that sidelined him all of last season, began his career at USC as a tight end.
“It’s a hard transition to have to make to be a major college quarterback all of the sudden,” Kiffin said. “But, James had a great attitude about it, and we are excited to work with him at it.”
Boyd stayed late after practice to get more repetitions at quarterback.
“I haven’t been a quarterback for two years, so I am just trying to get my mechanics back down,” Boyd said. “I am going to work on my footwork, get my arm back in motion and my reads down. I am also going to get advice from Matt [Barkley] and Mitch [Mustain], and learn the playbook.”
Now that Barkley is entering his second season as USC’s starting quarterback, he is adding a new skill to his tool belt—holding the ball during placekicks.
“[Special teams coordinator John] Baxter said it is a good skill to have at the next level,” Barkley said. “I have never done it before. It is a lot easier than I thought, but I have no plans to do it in the fall. If they need me to do it, I will.”
—
According to multiple reports, former USC tight end Anthony McCoy tested positive for marijuana at the NFL scouting combine in February. Kiffin did not feel the need to use the incident as a reminder about the consequences of using illegal drugs.
“That has been addressed with our players,” Kiffin said. “We didn’t need that for a teaching moment. I like to think we are ahead of that.”
—
On the injury front, wide receivers Ronald Johnson (elbow) and Kyle Prater (sore back) missed a significant portion of practice, only participating in individual drills. Kiffin described their status as day-to-day. Prater suffered his injury when redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo knocked him back during Saturday’s scrimmage. In other injury news, junior defensive tackle Hebron Fangupo returned to the practice field Tuesday, and the 6-foot-2, 330-pound lineman made his presence known by being extra vocal during the goal-line drill.

Down 8-0 as they came to bat in the sixth, the Trojans looked lifeless.
USC had mustered just three hits off UC Santa Barbara starter Greg Davis and looked like it was heading toward its longest losing streak since 2006.
Big hitter · Sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa continued his torrid streak of hot hitting for the Trojans on Tuesday, going 3-for-5 with two RBI, including a two-RBI single, during USC’s four-run ninth inning. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan 
But as the Gauchos went to the bullpen, the Trojans’ bats found an untapped reserve of life. They scored nine runs over the final four innings and stunned UCSB, 9-8 at Dedeaux Field.
Senior outfielder Mike O’Neill scored on a wild pitch to win the game, capping a bizarre night.
Senior Adam Dedeaux made his first start for USC (16-20), and it was a forgettable one. He lasted just two and two-third innings, allowing five runs on seven hits.
Junior Ryan Cabral relieved him and allowed two runs in an inning and a third. Senior Kevin Couture followed and gave up one run in two innings.
Then USC’s bats went to work against the Gauchos’ bullpen, beginning with Nick Loredo.
Senior designated hitter Keith Castillo drove in sophomore first baseman Ricky Oropesa on a groundout in the sixth to start the scoring. Sophomore catcher Kevin Roundtree followed with a two-run single in the seventh to make it 8-3.
USC didn’t stop there.
O’Neill led off the bottom of the eighth with a walk and came around to score on sophomore infielder Ryan Bast’s single, his first career RBI at USC.
He advanced to third on a single by sophomore infielder Ashton Kent and scored when Kent was caught in a rundown between first and second. He was eventually tagged out, but only after Bast crossed the plate.
Beleaguered UCSB reliever David Meals came in to pitch the ninth and hold down an 8-5 lead, but never got out of the inning.
Freshman pinch-hitter Cade Kreuter walked to lead off the inning, Meals hit junior infielder Joe De Pinto and Roundtree walked to load the bases.
Oropesa, who went 3-for-5 in the game, drove in two runs with a single to right. On the play, Roundtree was thrown out trying for third, and the tying run remained on first with one out.
Meals, however, continued to struggle. He walked O’Neill, pushing Oropesa to second. Castillo followed with an RBI single, scoring Oropesa and tying the game at 8-8.
On the play, O’Neill went to third, setting up the walkoff wild pitch.
With the victory, USC stopped a six-game losing streak and prevented its longest slide since losing 10 in a row to end the 2006 season.
Now, the Trojans will look to capitalize on the momentum from Tuesday’s game as they continue Pac-10 play. USC faces a stiff three-game test at No. 18 Oregon this weekend.
Your last paragraph sums it all up entirely. Capitalize from momentum of yesterday’s game and facing #18 ranked Oregon in it’s second year of baseball after a long hiatus being a top twenty team while the Trojans are four under .500 for the season.

Last week the NCAA’s Playing Rules Oversight Panel announced that eye black messages and live-ball celebrations will be punishable offenses in 2011.
“The rules committee voted unanimously on this. Let’s keep the lid on sportsmanship and prevent that type of demeaning,” said Dave Parry, the NCAA national coordinator of college football officiating. “I recall a play a few years ago where a player turned around at the 10 and teased the opponent with the ball. In the past this would be a penalty assessed on the extra point or kickoffs. Now, it’s no touchdown.”
In the past, officials could dock 15-yards from the extra point or ensuing kickoff for a live-ball celebration. Now high-steps, end zone flips, twirling, skipping and cartwheels are as good as a tackle.
“Just run it into the end zone, how hard is that?” said Indiana coach Bill Lynch after a spring practice. “It is a team game and that’s what makes it such a great game.”
Eye black messages like those made famous by former Trojan tailback Reggie Bush, who represented San Diego with ‘619’ below each eye, or recent Florida quarterback Tim Tebow, who scrawled bible verses on his cheeks before several games last season, were also outlawed by the committee. By 2011, Heisman hopefuls will have to keep their quips to Twitter.
Regulating sportsmanship has been a topic of debate since the NCAA cracked down on “excessive celebration” penalties in the 1980’s. Some players are concerned about expressing their identity.  Many of their coaches wonder how officials can objectively enforce this kind of rule.
“We all think the kids will understand [the rule],” said Connecticut coach Randy Edsall, chair of the rules committee. “This will cure those situations, and coaches will emphasize those things a lot more. I think it all comes back to the coach. Do the things the rules tell you.”

When they say you shouldn’t medicate with food, what they really mean is that you shouldn’t medicate with a pint of Ben & Jerry’s Cherry Garcia.
In reality, your grocery store can be a go-to spot for many common ailments. People have battled hangovers since we discovered hops, and PMS is in no way a uniquely modern epidemic.
Of course, today’s medicine is a miracle, and these recommendations should not replace your prescriptions or doctor’s advice. But for a few common ailments, consider giving natural remedies a try. Here are a few conditions and some foods that can help.
Anxiety. Have three papers due and are still recovering from a No Doze overdose? Chill out with a steak — the B vitamins found in red meat help regulate the nervous system. The best mix of B vitamins are found in red meat, particularly liver, but other foods that include various B vitamins are seafood, sunflower seeds, black beans, corn, mushrooms and bell peppers. Tryptophan, found in spinach, beans and most famously turkey, as well as magnesium, present in dark chocolate, seeds, beans and most greens, both promote relaxation and better sleep.
Bloating. Tonight you have a hot date but your stomach’s looking eight months pregnant. Save your boyfriend a heart attack and drink some tea. Basil, peppermint, chamomile and ginger teas can all ease the gastrointestinal tumult associated with an upset stomach.
Hangover. If you can do more than groan from your fetal position on the bathroom floor, head to the kitchen. Start guzzling water to rehydrate, and, in between chugs, grab some toast and bananas — the starches will settle your stomach, the potassium will help with hydration and the magnesium will soothe your pounding headache. Add some peanut butter and honey for extra magnesium and better taste.
PMS. If you scoff, “Bah, all I need is chocolate,” when contending with your monthly symptoms, you’d be right. Dark chocolate, especially raw chocolate (cacao), is high in magnesium and manganese, two nutrients that reduce irritability. Other sources for these nutrients are sunflower and pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, pineapple, potatoes and spinach. Calcium and vitamin B-6 will also allay the PMS demons. Get your calcium from low-fat dairy and dark, leafy greens, and score B-6 with meat, oatmeal and fortified breakfast cereal. So yes, a bowl of Lucky Charms with peanut butter and chocolate chips can be medicinal — but best keep it on reserve for Dawn of the Dead-level cases.
Headache. When a tapping pencil sends waves of agony down your neck, it’s time to get your inner fatty on. Omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish such as salmon and sardines as well as flaxseeds and walnuts, are scientifically shown to reduce headaches. Also potent are calcium and magnesium, especially when taken together. For calcium, eat dairy products, blackstrap molasses, collard greens and kale. For magnesium, go for nuts (especially almonds), halibut, spinach, dark chocolate and potatoes.
Constipation. Don’t give yourself hemorrhoids — just upgrade your diet. Many fruits and leafy green vegetables will help get things moving because of a mix of antioxidants, fiber and juice. The best fruits for constipation are grapes, figs, pears, guavas, papayas and oranges. Three other keys to free-rolling glory are insoluble fiber found in oatmeal, whole grain bread and high fiber cereals such as Kashi GoLean; lubricating healthy fats such as olive oil and almond butter; and water, for hydrating your organs.
Diarrhea. At the more explosive end of the spectrum is the tail end of a night of drinking and Chano’s. In some ways, it’s best to let nature run its agonizing course, but a few foods can help. Starchy vegetables and legumes, especially carrots and lentils, replace lost nutrients and limit fluid loss. The tannin found in pomegranate, blueberries, blackberries and persimmons act as an astringent and will also help. If you aren’t lactose intolerant (a frequent cause of diarrhea), the probiotics in yogurt will strengthen your gut and replace beneficial flora. Translation: hit up Red Mango or Yogurtland.
Toothache. What if it’s Saturday and your mouth is throbbing? To make the wait for a Monday dentist appointment more bearable, chew on some cloves — they are natural pain relievers and have antiseptic properties. Another pain reliever is garlic, especially when sprinkled with salt. Also, for a preemptive strike, chewing on onions kills oral bacteria.
Common cold. You might have heard the old saying, “Feed a cold, starve a fever.” It’s time to get more precise. Indulge your Indian or Thai craving and order takeout. Turmeric, pepper, ginger, lemon and garlic are all great cold relievers. Turmeric is one of the most healing spices in the world — it’s an antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and detoxifier. Garlic is also antibacterial. Vitamin C-rich lemon can shorten the duration of a cold while ginger settles the stomach. In general, strong spices are great for opening up the sinuses. Just keep some tissues handy.
Sunburn. Blame it on falling asleep to good music. Either way, when your sexy summer tan becomes lobster-fied, it’s time to hit up the dairy aisle. To relieve pain, apply full-fat yogurt or a milk-soaked cloth to the skin for 20 minutes, then rinse. Starchy potatoes do the same thing. Prevent blisters by applying avocado, apple cider vinegar or lemon. For a simple cooling effect, apply chilled cucumbers, spa-style.
Loved your article! Very informative and witty! :)
Great article and you have a lot of good knowledge to share, but you can take healing  through diet much further.  Start by reading The China Study by T. Colin Campbell.  It covers decades of study proving that diet can be used to prevent, reduce and to even reverse the diseases that are plaguing our population: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and cancer.  Dr. Campbell provides peer reviewed data that a whole food plant based diet can do all that and more.    http://www.tcolincampbell.org

Faulkner is a band that is just as eccentric as its namesake.
“When I was in Egypt, I met this sage in the desert, and he had a horse named Faulkner,” said guitarist and lead singer Lucas Asher. “So I named the band after the horse.”

As an orphan, Asher has lived in diverse places that have expanded his musical and personal horizons, including New York, Northern California, London and Egypt. After making his way to Southern California, the band began to form under his guidance.
“Lucas was pretty much the one who found all of us,” said Brennan Barry, the band’s lead guitarist and a New York native.
Asher met Barry, drummer Donald Gray Jr. of southern California and bassist Dimitri Farougias, a USC alumnus originally from Greece, through the Los Angeles music scene. Although the foursome has only been playing together for a year, the band’s cohesiveness reflects the four men’s immediately apparent chemistry.
“We really clicked once we all met each other — musically and as friends,” Gray said.
Faulkner’s intense dedication to music has gotten the band off to a fine start in its career. The politically aware song “Unite For Workers Rights” resonates with listeners particularly in this troubled economy, and it earned the band the honor of being one of the first independent artists to be featured on KIIS 102.7 FM. Following the advantageous radio exposure, the band was approached by several record labels.
Before anything is set in stone, however, Faulkner has decided to focus on building up its fan base. The group’s first official EP will be released in July, and the band will be touring up and down the Pacific Coast to promote it.
In the meantime, Faulkner has been recording new material in the band’s own private music space, the Empyreal Studio. But making music is not the only thing the studio is used for.
“We plan on doing community events there, like open houses with cheap tickets and free parking,” Asher said. “We want to have a good time without breaking the bank for people.”
These events are slated to begin next month at the studio, which is located in Silver Lake, Calif. The unpredictable nature of Faulkner’s sound makes it impossible to predict what type of songs it will put together next.
“We don’t have a specific genre,” Farougias said. “We can’t really be classified as anything because we like so many different styles of music.”
Gray said that since the group has such a broad range of musical tastes, it can be a challenge to properly pay homage to each. The members of Faulkner are influenced by everyone from John Mayer and the White Stripes to Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan.
“At a show, we’ll play a reggae flavored tune, a straight up punk tune, a rock ballad,” Farougias said. “We’re not trying to cram all those influences into one song, we’d rather separate them and write really good individual songs in those styles.”
Faulkner has already released five music videos with the help of professional director Ronnie Silos. In what Asher describes as a meeting of fate, Silos heard the band’s music and wanted to work with them. He contributed about $100,000 worth of equipment to shoot the videos, all of which are set outdoors, which Asher says represents freedom at its finest.
Freedom is only one theme the band is adamant about expressing. While “Unite For Workers Rights” led listeners to assume that Faulkner is a protest band, the guys are quick to refute the label.
“It’s about the philosophy of observing and seeing what we observe in life,” Asher said. “What we want to do is capture the human experience and capture moments in life.”
Admirably, Faulkner shares administrative duties, such as booking and promotion, as well as creative responsibilities among its members. As self-managed musical artists, they call themselves a “working-class band” and strive to relate to everyday people.
Faulkner has been able to play gigs at virtually every venue in Los Angeles, which is a price the band is more than happy to pay.
“I think the L.A. music scene is the best music scene in the country, if not the world,” Barry said.
Faulkner has had some lucky breaks along the way, but the group realizes it still has a lot of work to do. However, its professionalism and general musical know-how makes the musicians’ future in the industry very promising.
“Everybody is confident with their skills and understands the music language,” Gray said. “Our drive and experience in the Los Angeles music scene for so many combined years is what sets us apart.”
Great article boys!
I saw these guys at the Viper room. Great band! They Rocked

When students of the Thornton Opera Program and the Thornton Chamber Orchestra jointly present their rendition of Richard Wagner’s comedic opera Das Liebesverbot tonight at Bing Theatre, it will represent a victory not only for the university’s music school but for the entire West Coast. Tonight’s Visions and Voices event will be the premiere production of the opera on the West Coast and only the second staging in North America.
Crackdown · In Wagner’s Das Liebesverbot, love, laughter and celebrations of all kinds are outlawed when a departing king appoints a new ruler. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan 
Wagner’s Das Liebesverbot — whose name translates to The Ban on Love — tells the story of a struggle between a prudish Lutheran from Germany and the passionate Catholics of Italy. The German composer uses his opera to comment on the advantages and disadvantages of yielding to the callings of an untamed heart rather then blindly following laws and the dictates of authorities.
Set in Sicily, the opera opens when a king leaves for Naples and appoints his trusted right-hand man, Friedrich, to take over during his absence. Friedrich uses his new power to create social reform by banishing carnivals, drinking, laughter and love — he even condemns a man named Claudio to death for impregnating his lover.
Claudio knows that his only chance of a pardon is to convince his clever sister Isabella, who lives in a convent, to plead his case in front of Friedrich. Isabella’s powers of persuasion work perhaps too well when Friedrich, overcome with passion, succumbs to lust and trades Claudio’s release for a night with Isabella.
To expose Friedrich’s hypocrisy, Isabella agrees to the exchange and plans to trap him by sending Mariana, his secret ex-wife and fellow sister at the convent, in her place. Isabella reunites Friedrich with his wife, softens his heart to love, saves her brother and restores love and beauty into the world.
The opera’s convoluted plot, inspired by Shakespeare’s early 17th century comedy Measure for Measure, is typical of Wagner’s style. The composer’s works are often lofty, melodramatic and lengthy, and in every sense Das Liebesverbot is no exception.
Despite Wagner’s characteristic grandiosity, however, the USC Thornton School of Music Opera Program does an excellent job of making the production relatable and entertaining.
With the help of immensely talented professionals — led by stage director Ken Cazan — working behind the scenes, the set transforms from a brothel, to a dungeon, to a courtroom and then magically blossoms into a monastery. Impeccably well-planned lighting facilitates the many transformations, ensuring that — although simplistic — the production is up to USC’s standard.
But as should be the case with opera, the voices stand above all else. Isabella, played by Alex Loutsion, a graduate student studying music performance, soars above the rest with a graceful, flawlessly powerful voice that fully embodies the balance between love and decadence.
The complexity of Loutsion’s singing sets a standard for the entire opera. She is able to sing with the passionate pleading of a nun and still hint at the purity that guides her. Her presence commands respect, and her talent warrants it.
Yet as much as Loutsion deserves the praise befitting a prima donna, there is simply too much talent on the stage for her to be singled out as the show’s only powerhouse. From the random character in the corner to the male lead, Friedrich — who was played by Kyung-Teak Lim, also a graduate student studying music performance — each performer exemplifies commitment and excellence to his singing and acting. These performers prove that opera, which has a history of neglecting the sensibilities of theatrical acting, can retain the emotion of theater while staying true to operatic art.
In the role of Police Chief Brighella, Federico Flores steals the stage with his performance in Act I Scene 3. Dorella, played by Sophie Wingland, a graduate student studying vocal performance, seduces Brighella, and with just the right amount of cheesiness, Brighella transforms from judge to helplessly lustful fool.
Even tavern junkie Pontio Pilato, played by Jeongmin Wee, a graduate student studying music performance, defies operatic conventions as he runs around the stage with his funky mannerisms and hilarious imitations.
But don’t let the acting fool you; as impressive as the production’s staging, acting, lighting, scenery and sheer entertainment value are, the quality of the opera begins and ends with the voice.
Opera is not Hollywood, and Ken Cazan, the resident staging director, makes sure to emphasize that by refusing to typecast. Claudio is played by Asian actor YuJoong Kim, for instance, while his sister Isabella is portrayed by an actress with Greek heritage.
The only important thing is that their voices match, and they certainly do. The kinship is clear in their harmonies, and there is tangible brotherly love in how Kim’s voice supports Loutsion’s.
It is this reliance on vocal excellence that testifies to the professionalism of the university’s opera program. The talented students’ ability to not only maintain a standard of opera but also build upon it with realistic acting and seamless staging makes tonight’s Vision and Voices event a must-see.

These are students known for their athletic talents. They get recognized with scholarships and accolades. You’ve even read about them in this space.
But it’s been a goal here at “Spittin’ Sports” to draw your attention to some of the lesser known but equally talented athletes on campus. Today, I would like to do that again by recognizing a group that gets no scholarships, MVP awards or national championships.
You, the student body.
I see you every day dodging bicycles, skateboards, tractors, bobcats, caterpillars, motorized scooters, buses and Department of Public Safety cars. Patches O’Houlihan would be proud.
It’s incredible. I’ve seen students walk out of Taper Hall at 11:50 a.m. onto Trousdale Parkway, look to the left at the herd of wildebeests on bikes and skateboards approaching and do a better buttonhook than Ronald Johnson. I’ve seen students execute spin moves on bikes that would make Joe McKnight blush.
It’s a fact — Trojans are inherently athletic. It’s in the Trojan Family’s blood. Freshmen just learning how to walk around campus possess the jab step right, go-left maneuver and have perfected the hesitation move to open up space down the lane.
But it’s not just the walkers who possess all the talent. The bikers and skateboarders deserve some kudos too. Before I came to USC, I wasn’t aware that every competitor in the Summer X Games attends this school.
How else do you explain how the 10,000 students trying to get to their 2 p.m. class arrive without injury (mostly)? Students on beach cruisers have the quickest reaction time this side of the star-nosed mole (fastest reaction time of any animal, Google it). Without even paying attention, the beach cruiser-ites can apply the brakes at a moment’s notice as a faster and more agile mountain biker cuts in front of them at the last possible second.
What’s more remarkable is that despite everything that is thrown into the bikers’ paths, they still manage to hold a conversation. The other day, my buddy Edd and I were separated by two bikers, a skateboarder and a USC Hospitality mobile, and our conversation remained unfazed.
The skateboarders are equally as quick and sporty. You think the sidewalks around campus and on University Avenue are smooth sailing? You must not be a skateboarder then. Every crack and uneven surface presents an obstacle for the riders of the four-wheeled device. Instantaneously, they must decide to channel their inner Bode Miller and go around it by imagining every walker turned into a slalom gate or jump over it à la Tony Hawk.
Many of these bikers and boarders have more cajones than Evel Knievel. Riding at high speeds and in crowded areas, they cruise along with no helmet and little regard for the unfortunate soul who happens to cross their path. The worst mistake USC ever made was putting the medical school across town.
Despite all these fast-twitch muscle fibers roaming Child’s Way, inevitably there are students more athletic (or stupid) than others. This results in some of the best crashes not caused by Tony Stewart. Sitting in front of the Catholic Center for an hour in the middle of a weekday is like lying on the sand in Tahiti staring at the stars. It’s almost guaranteed you’ll see what you’re looking for.
Even some of the highly rated recruits and avid readers of the “How To Get Around USC” playbook find themselves on the ground every now and then. But what keeps those students upright more than others are a few careful techniques that can only be picked up by years of training and experience.
Those practices involve drafting — the act of following another rider to decrease the effort exerted but more importantly using the person in front as a battering ram; field vision — the act of keeping your head on a swivel but never making eye contact with the student approaching you; and knowledge of the course — taking the back roads to get to your destination.
It has been rumored recently that DPS and the university are thinking about removing bikes from campus and forcing students to park them on the outskirts. I think this is the worst idea since O.J. Mayo. Doing so would prevent students from displaying their natural athletic gifts on a daily basis and would remove much of the fun that is involved in getting to and from class.
Given all this talent, there is still one enemy the student body just hasn’t figured out how to beat. It hits the students in the head, causes them to swerve into curbs, grabs their backpack as their skateboard keeps going and ends up broken at least once a week, probably because of the frustration of a student who just barged right through it.
Someday, students will learn to dodge the yellow gate.

This week is Earth Week — a 40-year-old nationwide celebration.
Is this news to you?
The Earth Week Committee of Philadelphia created the event to raise awareness throughout the United States and provide a “comprehensive picture of the environmental issue confronting mankind.”
You are not alone if you weren’t aware of it until now; at USC, the event seems to have been overlooked.
Though 40 years old, this year is only the second year USC has held an officially organized Earth Week. Unfortunately, it has not as success ful as passionate Trojan environmentalists have hoped.
Why not?
As with many ambitious non-profit efforts, shortage of funding was the main issue that faced those trying to plan a week of events. However, according to Sustainability Program Manager Matthew Oden, the lack of “resources and manpower” was also a huge problem in planning the week’s events.
Other schools boast extravagant schedules, including corporate sustainability panels and an “Earth Week Extravaganza” at UC Berkeley;  a carnival, group bike ride and gardening day at UCLA; and several other packed schedules at various schools like UC San Diego and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo
Why then, haven’t Trojans caught on?
We have plenty of potential manpower, and the proud Trojan spirit leads us to believe we do everything better than anyone else — so why are we slacking on the Earth stuff?
Whether we want to admit it or not, it is our responsibility as a school to put a greater emphasis on events such as these and not solely on a few student organizations.
Some might argue that it is not the ethical responsibility of a university to worry about things other than its academic agenda. However, universities have long been known for taking action when others would not.
In fact, the whole concept of Earth Week was created by a committee of college students mostly from the University of Pennsylvania, and a group of students from Columbia University made the event national. Earth Week is no foreign concept to the college setting.
I wonder why USC is lacking a overwhelming response to Earth Week. Maybe it was just a lack of publicity for the event and less than stellar recruiting for the organizations that helped put it on. Surely it cannot be that Trojans don’t care about the environment.
I have to admit — I’m somewhat of a hypocrite in writing this. I like to think of myself as an environmentalist to some degree. I shop with reusable bags when I remember, change my light bulbs at home to more energy efficient models and I don’t even eat meat.
Yet, I didn’t volunteer to help with Earth Week. If I had I heard more about it, or been recruited to help out, I like to think I would have done my part.
The funding might not come right away, but the manpower is already here. It’s time we take the initiative to provide for Mother Earth.
Mark your calendar for next year.

Well, USC is not an officially religious university. Why should we devote a day or week to worshipping Gaia and spreading the gospel of Global Warming? Are we going to do the same for all religions then?

A week ago, on April 14, students, teaching assistants and faculty gathered for a town hall meeting with the Center for Excellence in Teaching to discuss grade reformation and the establishment of a universal grading policy at USC. They reached no verdict on the best solution.
American institutions of higher learning attempt to emulate those of ancient Greece, whose famous thinkers transformed the world. Yet our grading policy and general educational structure fails to cultivate the desire for knowledge that the ancient Greek thinkers embraced.
To overcome this deficiency, USC should adopt a policy of apprenticeship in course progression as opposed to distant and imperfect grading scales that fail to measure students’ potential.
Ideally, every college student would dedicate their careers to learning while professors would devote their livelihood to seeking knowledge and passing it on to the next generation. In this situation, grades are unnecessary.
Grades were created because of a lack of dedication to learning; they provide an incentive system with schools and society. Higher grade point averages mean progression within the system and supposedly imply success.
The GPA system provides an indicator of success and plays a significant role in our school and career progress. Thus, grades often motivate students to study for testing purposes rather than learning purposes. It is the classic argument against standardized testing in education.
If we have grades, the criteria should be clearly articulated by the university, not relative to others, and be defined by the amount of knowledge the student acquires and pursues.
For example, an A might consist of a display of curiosity that seeks knowledge above and beyond the given material. A letter B grade might represent high comprehension of the material presented in coursework. Anything less would be beneath the classroom standard.
In this setting, a professor might give an exam with 70 percent of the questions directly from the coursework and 30 percent of new knowledge, relevant to the course yet not taught in class.  This would encourage students to engage and comprehend the course subject matter rather than simply regurgitating facts for testing purposes.
However, the ancient Greek thinkers did not have a grading system. Their knowledge-hungry culture was incentive enough.
In their system, students were passed from teacher to teacher as they mastered the material, similar to how someone moves from algebra to calculus. But the teacher and student had a sincere relationship, similar to that of a mentor-apprentice.

The teacher knew the strong comprehension capabilities of the students based upon their close interactions, not by the grades they received in class.
This concept is familiar to universities, yet poorly incentivized. USC professor of philosophy  Dallas Willard acknowledged this issue in Jim Nelson Black’s book Freefall of the American University when he said, “The reward for faculty members who do good work is more research and less teaching,” he said.
This system diminishes capacity for student-professor relationships and apprenticeships.
Professors know what is necessary for students to advance in the school system and be able to decide whether to pass the students forward, similar to the power of teachers in grade school. But since students are more mature, they have the opportunity to contribute to the course instruction as well, creating an engaging, two-way dialogue.
One imperfection of this system could arise when a professor and student relate poorly. Hopefully, a professor would be mature enough to still see and nourish potential in this student. But if this fails, a student can still approach the next professor to display his knowledge and readiness.
Implementation of this system could bar students from progressing and even graduating. Such a scenario might force students to change majors or transfer. However, barring slacking students from obtaining a degree would increase the value and credibility of a USC degree.
This “apprentice” system would also attract high-quality, knowledge-hungry students much more than a standard grading system. Professors would also be permitted to take students much deeper into the material.
Since graduate schools and employers often require a look into a student’s performance record, grades could be maintained in a system hidden to students similar to that of St. John’s College. The school employs a progression system that is highly relational with private oral exams and discussions between students and professors each semester. The college records grades for students, but does not report them to students unless they are requested. If USC adopts the apprentice organization, professor recommendations would assure the quality of students to graduate schools.
The CET should investigate this sort of apprentice system, creating tighter bonds between students and faculty and cultivating a knowledge-seeking student body. Professors can implement a new testing system that includes questions requiring self-learned information on the course topic to better distinguish between knowledge-seeking students and otherwise.
In adopting this structure, USC would establish a new method of learning among universities while becoming an elite learning institution that trains students to think and learn rather than to test and pass.

The No. 15 USC women’s tennis team thought it had finished its regular season.
Not so fast.
The Pac-10 announced today that the USC-Stanford dual meet which was suspended because of rain will be completed Wednesday, the day before the Pac-10 championships are set to begin in Ojai, Calif.
The match between the No. 11 Cardinal and Women of Troy wad tied at 3-3 when the rain made the courts unplayable. The two teams had  completed the singles portion of the dual meet when it was suspended, meaning that three doubles matches will decide the match.
The Pac-10 required the teams to finish the meet because although USC has been eliminated from Pac-10 title contention, No. 8 UCLA can still share the crown with the Cardinal if USC is able to beat Stanford. UCLA is currently 6-1 in conference and Stanford is 7-0.
If Stanford loses, then a dual meet between UCLA and California that was also postponed would be forced to occur, and a UCLA victory would give the Bruins and Cardinal the joint Pac-10 title.
The dual meet will be considered a Stanford home match although it will be played in Ojai, meaning that Stanford’s 161-match home winning streak will be put to the test hundreds of miles away from Palo Alto, Calif.
