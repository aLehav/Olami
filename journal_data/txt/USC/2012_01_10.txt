USC plans to build a new outpatient clinic on the Health Sciences Campus after a $15-million donation from the Kenneth T. and Eileen L. Norris Foundation, the university announced Tuesday.

The Norris Healthcare Consultation Center will house a variety of clinics focusing on cancer care, including those for radiation therapy, imaging and infusion therapy.
The proposed site of the building is a parking lot next to USC’s Healthcare Consultation Center I and Healthcare Consultation Center II.
The Health Sciences Campus’ space for patient care is slated to increase from more than 1 million square feet to more than 2 million square feet by 2035, according to a master plan approved in January 2011.
The Norris Foundation has donated to support USC cancer care before, naming the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and USC Norris Cancer Hospital. The Norris Foundation’s donation is the primary gift to the center, according to a press release, but funds to build it will also come from money raised by the Campaign for the University of Southern California, a $6billion fundraising initiative launched by President C. L. Max Nikias last year.
Harlyne Norris, trustee and past chairwoman of the foundation, said the gift was intended to augment current cancer care at Keck.
“Having had a long and successful relationship with both USC and the Keck School of Medicine, we’ve seen how cancer patients are treated much more on an outpatient basis than they used to be,” Norris said in a press release. “This new facility will transform the way people with cancer are treated today and in the future. We’re very privileged to be able to help keep USC on the cutting edge of cancer treatment.”

The university will increase the number of full-tuition scholarships it offers by more than 40 because of a $3.8-million gift from the Stamps Family Charitable Foundation, which has established scholarships at leading research institutions across the country.
Stamps Scholarships will be awarded to 10 freshmen at the beginning of the fall semester starting in 2012 and continuing through 2016. The Penelope W. and E. Roe Stamps IV Leadership Scholars will be nominated by a panel of USC faculty members for their leadership and innovation, according to Katharine Harrington, vice president of admissions and planning.
“It’s 10 new students who would otherwise not be receiving a full-tuition scholarship. That can make the difference to whether a student can come. Certainly what it does is it relieves most of the financial burdens of a world-class education,” Harrington said in a statement.
The Stamps Scholars will be awarded the same standing as the Trustee, Presidential and Mork Scholars and will receive a discretionary fund of $5,000 for study abroad, unpaid internship and summer research.
President C. L. Max Nikias said the Stamps Scholarships reflects the university’s diversity and strength of the student body.
“This is a tremendous vote of confidence in USC and its talented students, and the Stamps Family Charitable Foundation’s exceptional support will go a long way in helping the university bring the brightest and most deserving students to our campuses,” Nikias said in a statement.
The Stamps Charitable Foundation has established scholarships at 24 universities across the country.
“We are excited to work with the University of Southern California, given its preeminence in a wide variety of academic fields, proven ability to develop leaders, international reputation and influence.”
According to USC’s new strategic plan, released on Monday, the university is striving to increase the number of full-tuition scholarships it awards to students.
Gov Brown’s budget subsidizes the tuition of foreign students at University of California. Californians subsidize the tuition of foreign students at UC Berkeley (UCB) in the name of diversity while instate student tuition/fees are doubled. UCB Chancellor Robert J Birgeneau replaces Californians qualified for public UCB with a $50,600 payment from foreign students.
UCB is not increasing enrollment. Birgeneau accepts $50,600 foreign students and displaces qualified instate Californians (When depreciation of assets funded by Californians are in foreign and out of state tuition calculations, out of state and foreign tuition is more than $100,000 +  and does NOT subsidize instate tuition).
Like Coaches, Chancellors Who Do Not Measure Up Must Go: remove Birgeneau.
More recently, the campus police that report to Chancellor Birgeneau deployed violent baton jabs on students protesting Birgeneau’s tuition increases. The sky will not fall when Birgeneau and his $450,000 salary are ousted.

[Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that Manbir Singh was 63. He was 67. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
 
Manbir Singh, a professor of radiology and biomedical engineering and pioneer in biomedical imaging technology, died of unknown causes while visiting family in India during winter break. He was 67.
In memoriam · Manbir Singh will be remembered as an understanding, easygoing, and compassionate person. He was a pioneer in biomedical imaging. - Courtesy of the Viterbi School of Engineering
Singh, who received his Ph.D in physics from UCLA in 1971, joined the Trojan Family in 1977 as a professor in the Department of Radiology. In 1988, he received a double appointment in USC’s Biomedical Engineering Department.
“I see him as the professor,” said Dr. Patrick Colletti, a professor of radiology and Singh’s former student. “He had this way of presenting materials in an organized manner so you could remember them — even complicated things could be broken down.”
Sinchai Tsao, a graduate student studying biomedical engineering who worked with Singh, said Singh was easygoing and understanding.
“One of the cooler things about him is he just let us express what we thought, and he would never judge us on what our ideas were,” Tsao said. “He was always open to chatting about what we thought.”
Biomedical Engineering Department Chair Norberto Grzywacz said he quickly learned of Singh’s good heart when he came to USC in 2001.
“First thing I had to do was write a grant proposal, and I didn’t even have an office yet, and [Singh] gave me his,” Grzywacz said. “He was really friendly, really nice.”
At home, Heidi Singh, Singh’s wife of 41 years, said he was a wonderful, great soul.
“He was a very open person,” said Heidi Singh, who said she is a Buddhist and her husband was a Sikh. “He was really open of all religions and supportive of everyone.”
Singh pioneered biomedical imaging with the use of single photon emission computed tomography, which produces 3-D imagery of internal organs.
“He was an experimentalist,” said Richard Leahy, a professor of signal and image processing theory. “He worked hard and was dedicated to what he did, and I think his work was characterized by a kind of independence of thought.”
Singh founded and served as director of the Neuroimaging core and of the Department of Biomedical Engineering’s graduate program in Biomedical Imaging.
“He just did what he did because he loved it,” Heidi Singh said. “He loved making a difference.”
He is survived by Heidi and their son, Kabir Singh, 24.
A memorial service for Singh will tentatively be held on Feb. 2 at 6 p.m. in the Davidson Conference Center.

The Lyon Center locker rooms reopened this semester with new lockers that will replace lockers that have been in use for more than 20 years.
Let there be light · The main gym on the second floor of the Lyon Center was repainted and had its lights replaced with bulbs that are more energy efficient and are in accordance with current building codes. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
The renovations over winter break are the beginning of future improvements that will occur at the facility. Additional lockers were added to the second floor of the Lyon Center, said Justine Gilman, senior director of recreational facilities and fitness.
“The old lockers had a fair amount of rust and corrosion that formed over the years,” Gilman said. “It was really time to update aspects of the Lyon Center, and we were able to make some long-needed improvements over winter break.”
An altered system for assigning lockers has also been adopted this semester to make full use of the recent changes.
“For people that had yearlong lockers we reassigned them, and people who want to rent a locker we are assigning them half-length lockers,” Gilman said. “The day-use lockers are separate.”
Serenita Kumar, a graduate student studying clinical psychology, said she appreciates the updated lockers but is having difficulty using the one she has been assigned.
“The new system makes things easier because people can’t just pick and choose what they want, but unfortunately my locker is a little too high,” Kumar said. “They seem flexible about changing lockers though so I don’t think it will be a problem.”
Jimmy Mack, a senior majoring in biological sciences, said the newly installed lockers offer students better protection for their belongings.
“The lockers seem more secure because you can’t see into them and look at someone’s possessions,” Mack said.
Samantha Chaffin, a sophomore majoring in English and theatre, said the Lyon Center has other consistent problems that should be addressed and repaired.
“By the end of the semester, the machines always get run down and messed up,” Chaffin said. “It would be great to invest in new cardio machines because I think some are still broken from last semester.”
Lyon Center management is continually renewing equipment and responding to visitor concerns, Gilman said.
“We always have an ongoing equipment trade out that should be finished by the end of spring or early summer,” Gilman said. “We also believe that we have resolved the television issues. It was a software issue so hopefully they will all be working in a week or two.”
The main gym was also painted and furnished with new lights over the break.
“The lights that are installed follow some of the new codes so students can play in a safe environment,” said Arvin Varma, associate director of facilities and youth programs. “Each light is also expected to give us years and years of life, and it is supposed to take less electricity.”
The showers will be remodeled in summer 2012, which will continue the expected improvements to the Lyon Center.
“It’s a highly used facility so it takes a certain amount of wear and tear,” Gilam said. “We have to continue to upgrade and replace equipment because we want it to be a place where students can feel very comfortable.”

The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously approved a Senate resolution Tuesday night that proposes adding a two- to four-day October break to the academic calendar.
USG uses resolutions to formally communicate its position on an issue to the administration.
The break received overwhelming student support in an online survey conducted by USG earlier this year. Of the 905 respondents, 90 percent supported its addition.
Of the top 25 schools on US News & World Report’s Best Colleges of 2012, 13 have some form of a mid-semester fall break incorporated into their schedules, according to the resolution, which was authored by Residential Senator Aron Theising and former Residential Senator Susan Deng, who is currently studying abroad, and sponsored by Residential Senator Jordan Veira.
USG Vice President Logan Lachman said the break would provide a much-needed time for students to unwind in the middle of the semester.
“It would be a great way for students to rest since we do have such a rigorous academic calendar,” Lachman said.
Though USC has more instructional days than many similar private universities, Lachman said, an additional fall break would possibly be offset with an extension of the academic year.
The poll shows that students are generally split on extending the school year. Of the 905 survey respondents, 49 percent support starting the semester earlier, while about 40 percent support ending the semester later.
Adrien Ortega, an undeclared sophomore, said the benefits of a fall break outweigh the drawbacks.
“It doesn’t feel like the fall has enough time off,” Ortega said. “I would be willing to go for [an extension].”
Other students, however, said the proposed break would be too short to have a substantial effect on relieving stress in the middle of the semester.
“[A fall break] would not really make a big difference,” said Brianne Pallan, a sophomore with an undeclared major. “It’s not very long, so it wouldn’t really matter to me.”
Though some students would rather see USG advocate for a weeklong Thanksgiving break, USG President Monish Tyagi said a fall break would more effectively break up the fall semester. There are no instructional breaks between Labor Day and Thanksgiving break, a time span of nearly three months.
“The reason we were pushing for a break in October is it really does have benefits academically in the sense that you can pace your way through the fall semester … similar in placement to where spring break is,” Tyagi said.
As the population of out-of-state students continues to grow, Tyagi, who is from Atlanta, said the fall break would provide students with enough time to travel home.
“If you have a Thursday and Friday off, that’s enough time to make a quick trip home,” Tyagi said. “As USC becomes more diverse, in terms of the amount of out-of-state students we have, the break will be a benefit for those students as well.”
Scott Lejfer, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he would use the break to travel home to Boston.
“There are very few opportunities to go home,” Lejfer said. “All my friends on the East Coast have designated breaks to go home and I need that break to go home too.”
Based on USG’s experience with adding an extra day to Thanksgiving Break, Lachman said changing the academic calendar would require a considerable amount of time.
“The extension of Thanksgiving break was about three years in the making so these things do take time,” Lachman said.
Tyagi said USG’s next step in pushing for a fall break is to present the proposal to senior administrators.
“There are a lot of sides to be considered with this,” he said. “Students obviously have a huge stake in this, but also professors who have to adjust their schedule and the administration.”

Even though we are just a few weeks into the new year, it’s hard not to be intrigued by what lies ahead for the USC athletic program over the course of the next 300-plus days.
Served · Senior Steve Johnson looks to lead the Trojans to their fourth national title in a row. The Trojans will begin their season on Friday. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
2012 unequivocally has the potential to be the greatest chapter in the tradition-steeped annals of USC athletics.
There’s the men’s tennis team seeking a four-peat, the men’s volleyball team looking to exact some revenge at this year’s Final Four, the women’s basketball team seeking its first NCAA tournament appearance since losing to Duke in March 2006, the women’s water polo team trying to claim its second national championship in three years and the men’s water polo team attempting a five-peat. And who could forget a football team with unfinished business to attend to next fall?
With teams like these, champions are not hard to come by. And because of that, sometimes a few get overlooked.
Last May, while most students were jet-setting to their favorite destination or eagerly awaiting their first day at a new internship, Steve Johnson of the USC men’s tennis team was making history up in Palo Alto, Calif.
Though he was not in front of a packed house like the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, Johnson’s accomplishment of winning a singles and team NCAA title in the same year is definitely not a small feat.
In fact, since the NCAA championships went to a dual-match format, he’s the only Trojan to ever take home both crowns.
In a sports world that typically lavishes high-profile athletes in big revenue sports, it’s no wonder Johnson’s return to USC for his senior season never made its way on to SportsCenter — or any local sports telecast, for that matter.
In fact, when Johnson came back to USC to train just days after his victorious trip to the NCAA championships, there were no cameras, or news reporters following his every move.
It’s fitting for the five-time All-American that his return to USC didn’t warrant any “one more year” chants, because for those who have watched the Orange County native on the court, he isn’t the type of player that thrives on that type of attention. He’s the kind of guy who would rather be just another teammate instead of the face of the program. He’s the kind of guy who does his talking with a powerful serve or his trademark forehand, not with nationally televised interviews.
It’s no shock Johnson’s return didn’t send shock waves through the sports world. After all, big-time networks like ESPN, ABC and NBC have no horse in the race that is collegiate tennis.
But what’s the excuse for us as fellow peers not to follow Johnson’s final act?
For most tennis stars, the lure of the pro circuit makes college an obsolete career stepping stone. To be able to have the best player on the best team in the country right in our backyard is a rare treat to say the least.
Soon, Johnson will take his talents full-time to the pro tour. And though the 2011 NCAA men’s singles champion hasn’t made a huge splash just yet in WTA or USTA sponsored events (he lost in the first round of the 2011 US Open and 2011 Australian Open Wild-Card Playoffs), he is a big piece when it comes to the future American tennis puzzle.
Since Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras departed from the game in the early 2000s, the talent pool in the United States has thinned out on the men’s side. And with each passing phase, whether it be Andy Roddick, James Blake or Mardy Fish, fans are momentarily excited that on an international level, the United States has become first-rate in men’s tennis.
There’s no telling how far Johnson’s career will go, and he will be the first to tell you that his only goal at the moment is to improve to a level where he can consistently win at the professional ranks.
But, whether or not you care about the state of American tennis, don’t neglect an opportunity to watch Johnson play at Marks Tennis Stadium this spring simply because you might not know a double fault from an ace. After all, he’s a champion. He’s our champion.
 
“For the Love of the Game” runs every Wednesday. To  comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or email Dave at dulberg@usc.edu
Johnson is a great college player and has great serve/forehand. His backhand which he slices mostly will not hold up at the pro level. He has poor fundamentals with the 2 hander and will find it very difficult to crack the top 100.
You mean ATP instead of WTA?
NO mention of the women’s tennis team who needs a new coach finally after sixteen seasons of one final four only.
Track and Field on the women’s side could be a real threat this spring. Baseball is a ? mark, Swimming should do well in the ncaa on both sides. Stick with the spring sports which are now underway.

In a span of three days, two USC players have announced their intentions to leave the program despite a recent 10-win season.
Redshirt freshman wide receiver Kyle Prater confirmed Monday night he would transfer after arriving at USC in spring 2010 as an early enrollee. Prater’s announcement came soon after sophomore tailback Amir Carlisle obtained his release to transfer to Notre Dame.

“I will be transferring,” Prater said via Twitter. “I love my teammates, SC, my fans, athletic staff. Will always respect the coaches. God Bless.”
In two seasons with the Trojans, Prater was limited by nagging injuries, redshirting as a freshman in 2010 compiling just one reception for six yards last season.
The Illinois native, who was rated as the No. 3 overall prospect in the class of 2010 by Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com, will transfer to either Northwestern or Wisconsin, according to a report appearing in the Chicago Tribune on Tuesday. Because of NCAA rules, Prater will be forced to sit out the 2012 season should he transfer to a Football Bowl Subdivision school, but will be eligible to play in 2013 as a redshirt junior.
“He needs to be around his support group, and that’s his family,” Prater’s mother told the Tribune. “It will be either Wisconsin or Northwestern. I made sure he kept his academics up. He may have had other issues, but I made sure of that first and foremost. He will get his degree.”
Carlisle will transfer to Notre Dame, sitting out next season per NCAA rules, USC confirmed Monday.
The second-year tailback was similarly plagued by injuries in his first and only season with USC.
He appeared in five games, rushing for 118 yards on 19 carries and racking up seven receptions, including one for a touchdown in a 42-17 victory at Colorado on Nov. 4.
“This definitely was a family decision,” his father told the South Bend Tribune on Saturday. “It wasn’t just an Amir decision. We felt as though Notre Dame would be the best fit for him for the next four years.”
Last March, his father, Duane Carlisle, became the director of sports performance at Purdue, located in nearby West Lafayette, Ind.
The younger Carlisle considered Notre Dame during his recruiting process last January before eventually signing with USC.
Other players, such as senior defensive end Armond Armstead and redshirt junior wide receiver Brice Butler, are reportedly considering transferring as well. Since both players graduated in December, they will be able to transfer and to play immediately.
Armstead redshirted last season after not obtaining medical clearance to play after being hospitalized with an undisclosed medical condition last March.
Because of NCAA sanctions, USC can carry no more than 75 scholarship players next season.
Not really a loss of anything.
Not major contributors, and we can sure use the scholarships!!!

Following a heartbreaking end in the National Semifinals in 2011, men’s volleyball has reloaded and has the talent to contend for a National Title again.
“We’ve got the talent to be good at the end of the year,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “But no matter the circumstances, we have to stick to the same formula — improve every day and compete like hell.”
Spiked · Senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli looks to lead the relatively young team this season. Though the Trojans lost three All-Conference players, they are currently ranked sixth. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
With last year’s playoff loss to UC Santa Barbara, the No. 5 Trojans graduated four starting seniors from Ferguson’s first recruiting class. Starting setter Riley McKibbin and opposite Murphy Troy finished their careers as first-team All-Americans while starting outside hitter Tri Bourne and middle blocker Austin Zahn finished with all-conference honors.
Despite the loss of significant leadership, talent and firepower, the Trojans are focusing not on who they lost, but who’s replacing them.
The Trojans return starters at outside hitter, middle blocker and libero. Senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli and senior middle blocker Steven Shandrick, both returning starters, were voted team captains this year. The Trojans will also return sophomore libero Henry Cassiday, who started all of last season.
But the spots vacated at setter, opposite, outside hitter and middle blocker were up for grabs throughout the preseason. Since then, Ferguson has settled on a starting lineup featuring two reserves from last year’s team as well as two true freshmen.
Freshman Micah Christensen won the starting spot and tallied 35 assists leading to a team .667 hitting average in the season opener against Alberta. The 6-5 Christensen was the headliner of the 2011 recruiting class after starring in a variety of high school, club and international competitions as well as winning Hawaiian State Championships in basketball and volleyball.
“Micah’s used to being the focal point of the team. He’s an outstanding teammate and competitor,” Ferguson said. “He has a lot of poise and maturity for his age.”
Freshman Robert Feathers won the starting middle blocker spot alongside Shandrick.
“Feathers has been the youngest guy on the team because he’s always played up in divisions when he played club,” Ferguson said. “Plus, he’s almost all work ethic and character. If he can’t do something, he’ll kill himself trying.”
Redshirt junior Steven Mochalski is slated as the starting outside hitter alongside Ciarelli.
“Mochalski will crush any ball, can block and is an effective passer,” Ferguson said.
Redshirt sophomore opposite Tanner Jansen won the starting opposite spot after an intense competition with junior opposite Maddison McKibbin until McKibbin sprained his ankle during preseason training.
Redshirt junior Jeff Carlson was the backup setter last year and has since been moved to outside hitter. Carlson’s versatile blend of skills and athleticism make him a key reserve as a setter, hitter, defender and server.
“Carlson will start contributing very soon,” Ferguson said. “He can help us in a lot of different ways.”
Though the leaders and stars of yesterday have moved on, the 2012  men’s volleyball team is still as formidable as ever.

Winter vacation gave us a one-month hiatus from Los Angeles and, if the absence has not made my heart grow fonder, it has certainly made me hungrier. 
I’ve discovered a dependence on Yogurtland’s Original Tart with gummy bears as well as the free muffin samples at Seeds. I’ve missed the spiced almonds at Moreton Fig, which by the bowlful make a satisfying meal, and Bottega Louie’s breakfast pizza, which comes with a cracked egg on top — a Saturday brunch favorite.
You, too, might find yourself in similar food ruts, resorting to the same foods over and over again. And you might not realize how unsatisfactory those ruts can be.
My new year’s resolution will sound like everyone else’s: I want to eat better in 2012.
I want to eat better, although not necessarily healthier — a goal that differs from those who regrettably ate their weight in peppermint bark over the holidays.
And my resolution wasn’t always to eat better. The first thing I ate in 2012 was just a few strawberries.
At 12:02 a.m., I was well on my way to a nutritious year. But then a tray of stuffed mushrooms pocketed inside buttery phyllo dough caught my eye and — boom — my willpower got the best of me.
New Year’s resolutions are like Pillsbury cookies: They are as easy to break as they are to make. But Los Angeles, a place where noteworthy restaurants open weekly, is a city overrun with forward-thinking chefs. How difficult can exploring the city’s many restaurants, markets, trucks and stands be?
While reflecting on your favorite dining establishments, you’re likely to experience a train of thought similar to mine: Yes, there are restaurants in Venice other than Gjelina on Abbot Kinney. There are options on the Barney Greengrass menu other than potato pancakes and matzo brei. And there are pastry options at the Original Farmer’s Market every bit as satisfying as Bob’s burnt-apple fritters.
2012 is about discovering other places — and about eating better by eating with more curiosity.
I am not a foodie, and I’m guessing neither are a lot of Daily Trojan readers. The term itself seems to connote a sort of pretension, the adventure of finding the most unusual foods rather than an actual apprecia-tion for food itself. I tried being a foodie — it’s not for me. Better eating is not about eating for eating’s sake; it’s about expanding your palette and your food knowledge.
Los Angeles has an ever-developing food culture, and our curiosity should be developing with it. In November, food-truck king Roy Choi of Kogi truck fame opened his third restaurant, Sunny Spot. Patrons can dine on whole split lobster and homemade caramels there, a serious departure from the novelty of Choi’s other ventures, where he offers updated college dorm food and backyard picnic fare.
And Nancy Silverton, whose upscale Osteria Mozza is still one of the city’s hardest reservations, has recently opened, of all things, a burger joint. The restaurant, Short Order, opened in November and features a variety of intriguing hamburger combinations you’ve likely not tasted before.  The restaurant marks a new direction for Silverton, a long-renowned pastry chef, more recently a classic Italian connoisseur and now an expert in traditional American fare.
Los Angeles’ most notable food authorities are asking us to progress alongside them in all sorts of fascinating ways. Silverton and Choi have given this city new establishments that challenge the expectations they have set for themselves and the food their devotees are wanting to eat.
Their lead is a wonderful rally for other chefs to follow suit. But it’s an equally motivating message for those diners seeking new and satisfying food experiences.
And great food experiences need not be synonymous with stunning prices. The $80 tasting menu at Michael Voltaggio’s ink. beginning later this season should be every bit as much of an event as an all-you-can-eat “Beefsteak Sunday” at Bacaro, a $30 steal that includes free-flowing liquor. If you can, get in line for both. Los Angeles is a city well-known for its food, so we should take advantage of it.

A Noise Within is bringing back its popular production of Noises Off for a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it two weekend run at the company’s new theater in Pasadena. And this is a show worth driving to see.
Slapstick · Noises Off’s premise features a cast struggling to put on a sex farce, which leads to plenty of hilarious physical gags and mishaps. - Photo courtesy of A Noise Within
A Noise Within is a company of professional actors who rehearse and perform together repeatedly in a rotating repertoire of plays, and such an emphasis on company unity is particularly valuable in an ensemble piece like Noises Off. There is no stand-out performance here, and there need not be. Everyone is working to make everyone else look good and that selflessness (inherently rare to the sometimes ostentatious medium of theatre) leads to one well-oiled machine of an ensemble piece.
The play, a 1982 comedy by Michael Frayn, follows a frustrated director, his beleaguered cast and his exhausted crew as they struggle to put on a sex farce called Nothing On. Each of the three acts of Noises Off is comprised of a different performance of the laughably idiotic play-within-a-play: First, on the eve of opening night, a dress rehearsal rife with forgotten lines and botched cues; second, a matinée nearly ruined by the dysfunctional company’s backstage rivalries; and finally the climax, in which the production extravagantly collapses.
Noises Off is essentially the same show performed three times. As a result,it relies more on physical comedy than wordplay for its humor, unlike most plays. Actors in this show have to rely on each other rather than hide behind a clever script. Thanks to the careful comic choreography of directors Julia Rodriguez-Elliott and Geoff Elliott, and to their talented cast’s easy finesse, the play’s original hilarity gleams unaltered.
Take, for example, the show’s second act, in which the set is rotated 180 degrees so we can see the characters feuding backstage during a performance. It’s an easy scene to screw up. Although we can hear Nothing On in the background, almost all the main action is happening with zero dialogue. The act’s humor depends fully on well-timed physical gags.
The actors in this production rise to this challenge, scurrying, stumbling and tumbling with the graceful ease crucial for being convincingly clumsy. In other words, everything goes wrong in just the right way.
One minor gripe — the cast’s British accents are more than a little suspect. Geoff Elliott, for instance, who plays director Lloyd Dallas,  seems to have cribbed his Cockney directly from Michael Caine, who played Lloyd in the 1992 film adaptation. Whereas in some American productions of Noises Off the play’s characters are Americans who feign British accents for the stage, in A Noise Within’s rendition, they are English both on and off stage. Though certainly more faithful to Frayn, this directorial choice makes the off stage action feel a little phony. But that is a miniscule flaw relative to the overall top-notch quality of the acting here.
Noises Off is an important, funny and beautiful play because it illustrates the core silliness of life. If the set is a division between the real world (backstage) and the theatre (on-stage), then the set’s rotation signifies that the worlds are basically interchangeable.
As Noises Off progresses, the planes become less and less distinguishable until they finally coalesce into one absurd spectacle. Noises Off makes a simple statement about life as it celebrates the farcical reality of backstage drama, surely familiar to anyone who has worked in theater, and does so in a manner more absurd than any comedy we could possibly dream up.
The folks at A Noise Within have definitely done a wonderful job of conveying that absurdity. This is a great production of an equally great play, wholly recommendable to anyone in the Los Angeles area who loves a good show or needs a good laugh.
So happy to see a great review of a SUPERB THEATRE Troupe.  I have been a subscriber at “A NOISE WITHIN”
since 1995.  They do great classic drama and comedy.
Please come see this production. You will be laughing and and be loving this production.

Director Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s police procedural Once Upon a Time in Anatolia flaunts an epic treatment, evidenced by its lengthy 150-minute running time as well as its bold, assuming title. The film impresses, proving worthy of the Grand Prix award it received at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.
Foreign film · Writer and director Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s latest crime drama exploits a slow-burn pace and long pauses to heighten the foreboding and terribly dark aura created by the tense, on-edge, dramatic acting from Yilmaz Erdogan (right) who portrays Commissar Naci, a detective forced to investigate a mysterious missing body. - Photo courtesy of NBC Film
The slow-burn, methodical film centers on a search for a dead body, an investigation that consists of a prisoner (Firat Tanis) — the assumed killer of the missing person — a prosecutor (Taner Birsel), a commissar (Yılmaz Erdoğan) and a doctor (Muhammet Uzuner). Ceylan relies heavily on the patience of the audience, often lingering on images for an extended period of time as he unfolds Once Upon a Time in Anatolia’s narrative.
The film’s primary settings are split into two parts: the countryside, where the search takes place, and the city, where the main character, Doctor Cemal, returns after his duties are finished. In between, the film is separated by a beautiful intermission that takes place in the village home of a local farmer.
Ceylan is an acclaimed Turkish filmmaker, known for films that examine life and the human condition. In his sixth feature film, he truly brings together his artistic skills and talents, merging them into a cohesive whole.
The camera is never in a rush, and the search for the dead body  becomes desperate and helpless as Ceylan drags his characters from one desolate steppe to another, questioning our assumptions about the murderer and whether a murder place.
The film is less about what is said or what happens and more about what is suggested. The first two acts of the film take place in complete darkness, the blinding lights of car headlights serving as the only form of illumination. Ceylan also often diverts the gaze of the camera onto dark, orange skies as clouds begin to form as well as empty fields.
These subtle choices create a sense of haunting dread throughout the film that plays alongside an ominous atmosphere Ceylan brilliantly establishes early on. In one poignant scene, viewers move away from action onscreen and simply follow a rolling apple for an extended period of time until it settles at its resting place in a river. It’s quiet moments  like these where the audience is reminded of noteworthy filmmakers, such as Andrei Tarkovsky and Abbas Kiarostami.
Once Upon a Time in Anatolia is also surprisingly humorous. The film successfully brings together comedy and melodrama, particularly in scenes where the camera captures everyone crammed inside their small vehicles.
In one comical moment, Ceylan depicts all the members of the group hurrying into their cars when one suddenly stumbles behind with an armful of pumpkins, which he then helplessly tries to fit into the trunk of the car in a rush. In the otherwise dreadful world  Ceylan establishes, his injection of humor is welcoming because it fleshes out his characters — and the film’s world — through a more lighthearted lens.
And Ceylan’s slowing of time and working with the logistics of space proves his true talents as an artist of cinema. In this film, he emphasizes long pauses and allows for a meditative experience. Once Upon a Time in Anatolia becomes a close examination of character and humanity, especially when the themes come together with a grueling, all-too-realistic autopsy in the film’s conclusion.
And just like that, the audience is forced to speculate, left with more complex questions than it had when the film began.

Winter break has come and gone, leaving networks unable to rely on holiday favorites and repeats from the fall season. Since 2012 began, viewers have already been treated to a new Bachelor, the premiere of Lifetime’s Project Runway All Stars with brand-new judges and a new season of Pretty Little Liars where fans can finally find out who “A” really is.
The new year brings a wide range of television stars and shows together. Whether your favorite genre is animation- reality- or music-related, there is something for everyone. Here’s a guide to what you can expect in 2012.

Napoleon Dynamite, Jan. 15, FOX
Based on the hit movie Napoleon Dynamite, FOX is bringing back one of the most awkward teenagers in a brand-new television series. Napoleon continues to believe he is destined for greatness with his “sweet abilities.” His best friend Pedro has recently been elected class president while his Uncle Rico continues to live in his iconic orange custom van. The show looks nearly the same as the movie. In fact, the entire original cast has returned for the animated series.
The indie film opened back in 2004. Will fans still want to vote for Pedro and tune in eight years after the film’s success?
 
The Voice, Feb. 5, NBC
Last year’s surprise hit The Voice returns for a bigger season with even more talented singers and musicians. Premiering after this year’s Super Bowl, the singing competition will bring back Christina Aguilera, Cee-Lo Green, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton to mentor and to judge the contestants. Similar to last season, the blind auditions will return with the judges relying on the singers’ voice instead of their appearances. The next step in the process, the battle rounds, will cut the competition in half, leaving the best of the best fighting for the top prize. Stay tuned to find out if The Voice can keep its high ratings in the face of its competitor, American Idol, which also begins a new season in January.

NBC’s highly anticipated new series, Smash, might just be the next big hit for the network. The show brings viewers the blood, sweat, tears and drama –— all the makings of a Broadway musical. Will and Grace star Debra Messing returns to television as a songwriter while American Idol contestant Katharine McPhee competes to get the role of Marilyn Monroe for an upcoming production. With Steven Spielberg and producers from Broadway’s Chicago and Hairspray working behind the scenes, the show promises to be a realistic look at what makes a show a smash hit.
Real Housewives of Orange County, Feb. 7, Bravo
The original Real Housewives, who started the successful Bravo franchise, returns for a seventh season this February. Tamra Barney, Alexis Bellino, Vicki Gunvalson and Gretchen Rossi are back for more as they welcome newbie Heather Dubrow to the mix. Season six housewife Peggy Tanous chose not to return to focus on more positive adventures. Based on the previews for this season, viewers might finally see Rossi and Barney together as best friends forever. Bellino, however, will be making more enemies than friends.
Oprah’s Next Chapter, Jan. 15, OWN
It’s no secret the Oprah Winfrey Network struggled with ratings during its first year. Hoping to bring back both excitement and viewers, Winfrey has decided to return to the small screen with Oprah’s Next Chapter. The weekly series will take Winfrey outside her studio and into stars’ homes around the country. Since the show’s New Year’s Day premiere, Winfrey has traveled to Steven Tyler’s house in Sunapee, N.H., as well as Joel Osteen’s home in Houston, Texas.
In the upcoming weeks, viewers can expect Winfrey to visit Paula Deen’s ranch, walk on fire with Tony Robbins and meet with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.
Award Show Season, January and February
It’s that time of year when Ryan Seacrest prepares for his red carpet coverage, actors focus on their longer-than-necessary acceptance speeches and actresses hire the best stylists to ensure they won’t be on the worst dressed list.
January and February bring non-stop award shows, mostly recognizing the best films of the past year. Ricky Gervais will return as host for the Golden Globes Jan. 15 on NBC. The Shrine Auditorium will host the Screen Actors Guild Awards Jan. 29., Music fans can look forward to the 54th Grammy Awards Feb. 12. and finally, the most important show of the year, the Academy Awards, will air Feb. 26 with host Billy Crystal. Too bad most people are burnt out by the time the iconic Oscar trophies are finally handed out to the best in the business.

Death Valley National Park is a place so hot, gold prospectors named it after the thing they feared most.
What life could the unrelenting sun allow, let alone support? Now, more than a century later, we have a brilliant answer. California has set up an $800,000 solar panel array in the national park. It would reduce park costs by an estimated 70 percent.
So far, the state has been unable to agree with Southern California Edison, California’s chief electricity supply company, to introduce this and dozens of other similar solar power arrays into their grid.
USC has many environmentally conscious students. We should be able to help raise awareness of this issue.
SCE has the potential to perk up the state economy and further our goal of relying on renewable energy. What’s the problem, then?
The main stumbling block is federal law, which limits agencies from agreeing to contracts that leave them liable to future spending. Agreeing to such contracts would mean committing money that Congress hasn’t allocated.
However, there are ways around this restriction. Yosemite has been able to connect after agreeing with Pacific Gas and Electric Company. It estimates that it will save $50,000 on electricity bills.
The Governor’s Office sent its adviser on renewable energy to help hammer out the differences. Attorneys in the Interior Department’s solicitor’s office have been brought in to help resolve the issue. Yet so far, it hasn’t been enough.
The state of California is in a difficult position. But just like the nation, California has been striving to solidify its position as a jewel amid its peers.
This project takes us one large step toward this goal. Unfortunately, it seems that the same short-sightedness that brought about the state’s current difficulties are getting in the way of progress.
Californians have already done their part — we have provided the tax dollars to support these energy structures. We, as students, might not be able to directly resolve this issue. But the solidarity of our student associations can raise awareness, push for resolution and continue the state’s drive for improvement.

Picture an Internet without Lolcatz. Imagine a world without Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook or YouTube. Pretty scary, right? Well, it’s not a nightmare. It’s a situation that could occur if H.R. 3261, known as the Stop Online Piracy Act, is passed.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
SOPA is a House bill designed to enforce copyright law and to cut down piracy. Under SOPA, the Justice Department and copyright holders can take action to shut down any copyright infringement.
This doesn’t sound exceptionally bad, but the bill uses vague language to define copyright infringement.
If SOPA passes, a CNN piece containing a video clip from a recent movie could be in violation. A T-shirt on Etsy with the image of a copyrighted character? Also in violation. Social media is at risk. So that blog you have to write for your Writing 340 class, or any video you put on YouTube of a football game? Those might be dead in the water.
The truly scary part of SOPA is instead of just taking down the item in violation, it could potentially shut down the entire hosting site. In many cases, there would be no chance to challenge that shutdown immediately. By the time the domain owners get to court to challenge the matter, months could have passed.
It wouldn’t be as bad as the Internet shutdown seen in Egypt last year or the upcoming “halal Internet” being developed by Iran, but it would be close. SOPA puts the Internet in the hands of businesses, not people. It would no longer be a place of free speech and sharing.
So much for net neutrality.
On top of that, SOPA is actually going to compromise Internet security. The Internet is a global matter, and the Domain Name System that keeps track of all Internet IP addresses could be fragmented by US action and put cracks around the flow of websites, leaving them open to virus attacks.
And here’s another problem: SOPA won’t even stop piracy in the first place. People are going to find a way around it. Proxy servers proved effective in Egypt when all servers were cut, and those who are heavy pirates possess enough hacking skills to get around anyone looking for them.
Piracy is bad — there is no doubt about that. Everyone from monopolistic companies to independent struggling artists suffer when their content is pirated. But piracy is a service problem, and it needs to be dealt with on a service level. One must exercise precision to deal with specific, malicious pirates; SOPA goes to town on the Internet with a machete.
Congress is trying to regulate the Internet when it doesn’t understand how the Internet works. This isn’t to say all Congressmen are completely ignorant, but most members of Congress lack detailed knowledge of servers, DNS and net neutrality. What Congressmen do have is lobbyists telling them what seems bad on the Internet and pushing money into their pockets. This is why it has been so easy for SOPA to gain support in the House. No one is questioning its effectiveness and true meaning.
So what can we do to stop it? Speak out against it. Newspapers and television networks are barely covering SOPA, and Congress is flying by without input from anyone except lobbyists.
There are already petitions for President Barack Obama to veto the bill and the stronger they are, the more likely they are to succeed.
Call your representatives. It can actually work. Email them, call them, text them and crash their servers with an overwhelming message: Say no to SOPA.
SOPA isn’t some distant bill without student ramifications. It’s an attack on free speech and one of the biggest dangers facing the Internet. It targets the sites we use to connect and interact, and even the websites and platforms we use in class.
We’re the ones using the Internet, and the people who don’t are the ones who put together this bill. It’s time to stop SOPA from becoming law.
We need to speak out and hold Congress accountable. Let’s save the Internet. There’s more to it than just pictures of animals.

Great, thanks for the article. Didn’t so much agree with your “shutdown seen in Egypt last year or the upcoming “halal Internet” being developed by Iran,” as China is indeed one of the most egregious violators. Try to vary your attacks on other governments next time.
SOPA is more about commercial control of Internet content (meaning pay more) than it is about copyright infringement.  They don’t really want to prevent copyright infringement, they want us to pay more for content.  Cable TV providers are freaked out because of how quickly people are cancelling service to go all Internet (including myself).
Look at who supports this legislation.  The Antichrists of the Internet.
If it happens, we’re just going to navigate around it, just like always.

You’re right to be concerned. Although it’s difficult to argue with the concept of protecting the right of ownership of original materials, history is replete with examples of how the government can take a wholesome principle into unanticipated directions and wreak havoc. Every new policy creates new taxpayer burdens, also. And one final issue: Our copyright laws were developed long before the advent of modern global communications. It may well be time to re-think about the difficulties and complexities associated with the protection of written materials, and take the laws into more realistic directions. In addition to doing what’s right, we want to do what’s do-able, and there’s no point having laws that cannot be enforced alongside new, expensive government agencies that selectively attempt to enforce the laws when they can. Prohibition was a grand experiment in policy development and enforcement from which we should draw real lessons.

With the New Year finally here, we pause a moment to bid 2011 farewell. From music industry megaliths like Pitchfork and NME to rinky-dink bloggers beaming tomes of their beautiful enthusiasm out of Mom’s basement directly at no one in particular, seemingly everybody has been counting down the cream of last year’s musical crop. Now in no particular order we look briefly at the greatest of these lists—the best of ‘The Best Music of 2011’.
Kevin Bronson—“Buzz Bands LA’s favorite local albums of the year”
Veteran music journalist Kevin Bronson counts up the twenty best albums to have emerged last year from the music scene here in Los Angeles. You’ll find a couple LPs from heavyweight headliners (e.g., Foster the People, Cold War Kids) but also a treasure trove of music by lesser-known local bands.
Beyoncé—“Beyoncé’s favorite songs of 2011”
Beyoncé opts for minimalism, listing her ten favorite songs and the artists who made them and nothing else. The “Countdown” superstar doesn’t even count down. She earns a spot on this list for that exhilarating conciseness, and also for being the only person in the world who likes both Justin Bieber and James Blake.
Rob Sheffield—“The Top 25 Songs of 2011”
The Rolling Stone columnist offers up an overtly subjective retrospective. He selects songs based not on their quality but rather how much he enjoys them. (This might explain why, for example, Rebecca Black’s “Friday” makes the cut.) That professedly personal style makes for a perhaps more honest and certainly more entertaining ‘best of’ list.
Amoeba Music—“Amoeba’s YouTube Playlist of the Best Music of 2011”
Staff members at the California record store chain have released their favorite picks from last year in the form of a music video playlist. This format accommodates our short attention spans, sparing us from stupid boring words and letting us watch totally awesome videos instead. To boot, as one might expect from the employees at those eclectically-stocked superstores, this is an impressively varied selection of songs.
Pitchfork—“Pitchfork Readers Poll”
Perhaps merely by virtue of the site’s hugeness, reviews on Pitchfork attract a lot of dissent. And this readers’ poll empowers the dissidents. Particularly enjoyable are the ‘Most Underrated Album’ section, where scorned Childish Gambino fans strike back, and the ‘Most Overrated Album’ section, which rubbishes a laundry list of Pitchfork darlings.

One big emerging trend in video and film is an effect known as “tilt-shift.”
Tilt-shift is a style that makes real-life footage seem cartoon-like.  In the style, everything moves at hyper speed. People race around like toys at high speed and huge objects can seem miniature. Gigantic cruise ships suddenly race around the frame like toys, and huge construction machines seem comical.
The tilt-shift effect is created by an optical illusion. In a tilt-shift video, a significant part of the frame is out of focus. With only a small part of the frame in focus, the objects within the frame appear to be miniature. Our brains use depth of field (focus) to measure distance, and tilt-shift capitalizes off of this quality to create an illusion.
Most tilt-shift videos are shot at a downward angle, which further amplifies this effect.  Colors are often over-saturated to exaggerate natural colors, adding to the cartoonish feel.
If you’re interested in shooting in this style, hop on any video site — such as vimeo.com — and check out a few videos first.  Many of the best tilt-shift videos involve huge objects like boats or cars, but huge masses of people have also been very successful in some videos.
To shoot a tilt-shift video, all you’ll need is either a tilt-shift lens or post-production software that can create the effect. When shooting, keep in mind that the key to a tilt-shift video is movement within the frame.  Also, tilt-shift videos are sped up at least 10x, so long shots are key — 60 seconds of shooting is only 6 seconds in a tilt-shift video.

[Correction: A previous version of this article stated that the women’s basketball team will host UCLA on Jan. 14. UCLA is the host of that game.]
The Women of Troy claimed a conference road sweep this weekend in the Grand Canyon State, beating Arizona State 60-48 on Thursday before staving off Arizona’s late comeback bid in a 72-67 victory on Saturday.
Senior guard Ashley Corral went 7-of-8 from the free-throw line to lead the Women of Troy against the Sun Devils on Thursday. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan
“Last year we came down to Arizona and Arizona State and went 0-2, and that’s what kind of ruined our season,” junior forward Christina Marinacci said. “We came in with a chip on our shoulder. We wanted to play with more energy than [Arizona and Arizona State], even though we were on the road.”
After enduring several disappointing losses in their nonconference schedule, the Women of Troy (8-6, 3-1) have won four of their last five games and are starting to look like the team that was ranked No. 23 in the preseason AP poll.
Even though USC still feels the sting of close losses to No. 8 Texas A&M, No. 15 Georgia and unranked Arkansas State, they think the experience and motivation gained from those letdowns will help them in the long run.
“I attribute both of these road wins to the tough preseason schedule we had,” Marinacci said. “We were just over losing.”
The Wildcats (12-3, 1-2) staged a late comeback bid in the second half, cutting what was once a 16-point lead for USC to a 3-point advantage.
But senior guard Ashley Corral sank two clutch free throws with seven seconds left to preserve the victory, getting her ninth and 10th points of the day to fend off the pesky Wildcats.
Senior guard Briana Gilbreath was one of five Women of Troy to score in double figures on Saturday, leading USC with 17 points and nine rebounds.
The close win by the Women of Troy was preceded by a comeback victory of their own on Thursday night at Arizona State (10-4, 1-2).
The Sun Devils led by six points with 15 minutes to go, but led by a 21-point effort by Corral, USC stormed back to claim their largest victory in Tempe since 1999.
Corral went 7-of-8 from the free- throw line in the last four minutes to go along with four 3-pointers to clinch the win.
It was the first home loss of the season for Arizona State, as well as its first loss to an unranked team.
Ever since a shocking road loss to Arkansas State on Dec. 15, the Women of Troy seem to have righted their ship.
“We just got it together after that,” Corral said. “That was the downfall last season, we hit a streak [of losses] and never got everything going again. You have to come out of nonconference play with a chip on your shoulder.”
Since falling to Arkansas State, the Women of Troy have won four out of their past six games. Their only two losses since then were a one-point nailbiter to defending champion Texas A&M, and an eight-point defeat to No. 4 Stanford at home after leading for most of the game.
The four victories, meanwhile, have been won by an average of more than 10 points.
“All these conference games coming up are must-wins,” Marinacci said. “It doesn’t matter who we’re playing, if it’s a lower team in the Pac-12 or if it’s Stanford. We just have to take it game by game and not look ahead.”
The Women of Troy resume conference play on Saturday in Westwood against host UCLA (7-8, 2-2). Tip-off is at 2 p.m.
Once again you people do not know what end is up. The game with ucla is on their home floor wherever that
might be these days. The men host the ‘ruins on Sunday at 6pm in Galen Ctr..
