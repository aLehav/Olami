The USC men’s volleyball team finish up its brief stint playing at North Gym this weekend as it takes on No. 11 Pacific on Friday, and then host No. 3 Stanford Saturday night in a crucial conference matchup for both teams.
No looking back · Freshman middle blocker Chris Lischke has helped the Trojans win eleven straight matches since losing to UCLA in February. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (16-4, 12-4) rank second in the nation, behind conference rival UC Irvine. The Trojans beat the Tigers (7-11, 4-11) in Stockton earlier in the season, while the Cardinal (14-5, 11-4) were the top-ranked squad when the visiting Trojans topped them in the five-set thriller on Feb. 25.
That win was the fourth in a row, and the Trojans have not looked back since, currently on an 11-game tear.
Success is great, but the Trojans have been focusing all week on making sure neither rematch will be a letdown. Considering the Trojans sit second in the conference standings, every remaining game is crucial toward setting themselves up to make the four-team NCAA championships this April.
“Every game is our biggest game of the year,” senior co-captain and outside hitter Tony Ciarelli said.
In addition, the Stanford match will bring the usual excitement and fire that comes with a conference rivalry matchup.
“I always want to beat my friends,” Ciarelli said. “A couple of guys on their team I’ve played since I was a freshman.”
With only three more weeks of games, the Trojans continue to tinker with new lineups.
“We have two basic lineups … and we’re not sure which one to go with right now,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said.
This past week’s game served as an example of this, as redshirt sophomore libero J.B. Green started and played half the game against George Mason University, while freshman opposite hitter Cristian Rivera also earned his first start of the year.
“He has been on a steady incline all season,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson’s additional trust in the freshman should manifest itself in the pair of upcoming games.
In addition to focusing on their own play, the Trojans will take a different approach to their opponents this weekend.
“We’re going to focus on the skill sets of individual players on the other team rather than their play as a whole,” Ferguson said. Luckily, the Trojan squad wants nothing but the same result they’ve gotten since Feb. 10 —  a win.
Though the North Gym has been a great throwback to the storied history of the program, it seems like the players and staff are glad to be returning to the Galen Center for the final two home games of the year.
“[The North Gym’s] biggest difference is also its biggest advantage” said Ferguson. “It’s loud and there’s nowhere to go.”
To commemorate a return to North Gym, Friday’s match will be Beach Night, with free sunglasses and beach chairs given away, while Saturday’s match will be Retro ’80s night. Both games this weekend begin at 7 p.m.

After finishing nonconference play with a perfect record, the USC men’s tennis team will now begin Pac-12 play in the same city where it last faced defeat more than a year ago.
Bad memories · Sophomore Emilio Gomez and the Trojans have not lost a match since last February. Coincidentally, their last loss was in Seattle. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
The No. 1 Trojans (19-0) will kick off the conference season with a matchup against the No. 22 Huskies (12-3) in Seattle, Wash., Friday at 1:30 p.m., followed by a visit to Eugene, Ore., to face the Ducks (14-1) Saturday at 11 a.m.
USC features six ranked players in the singles category, the most of any school in the nation.
Leading the charge is No. 2 senior Steve Johnson, who holds a streak of 51 straight singles wins.
Several other Trojans hold their own respective streaks, such as No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen with 10 consecutive and freshman Roberto Quiroz with eight straight.
Sophomores Emilio Gomez and Ray Sarmiento and freshman Yannick Hanfmann, ranked No. 41, No. 24 and No. 30, respectively, have gone a combined 40-8 in dual match singles.
In doubles action, Johnson and Quiroz have strung together five straight wins, while No. 18 pair Nguyen and Sarmiento look to improve their 13-2 record in dual match doubles.
Gomez and Hanfmann, a pair that played together frequently in the fall preseason tournaments, have been reunited and have gone 4-1 in dual match doubles.
The Trojans have been successful on the road as of late, despite visits to hostile territory in UCLA and Stanford. After having the benefit of two straight matches at Marks Tennis Stadium, USC will now begin a four-game road trip to kick off Pac-12 play.
“It’s always special to play in the home matches in front of family and friends, but I’m looking forward to the road trips,” Sarmiento said.
The Trojans’ last loss came at Seattle, the site of the 2011 ITA National Team Indoor Championships, where they fell 3-4 to Stanford.
The Trojans will return to the Emerald City to face the Huskies, who are led by No. 14 Kyle McMorrow.
The team will then travel south to face the Ducks, who do not have any players ranked in singles or doubles.
USC coach Peter Smith, who has led the Trojans to three consecutive NCAA championships in his tenure, could be looking at his 200th victory with USC in the matchup against Oregon.
With a 39-match win streak dating to last February, the Trojans remain vigilant not to let the records and milestones distract them in their quest for a fourth straight NCAA title.
“We got to stick to our mentality, take it one match at a time and keep battling,” Nguyen said. “[We have to] take every team seriously, and everyone has to have a sense of urgency.”
Last year, the Trojans pieced together a perfect record in conference play en route to their third conference championship in four years.
The Trojans hope to maintain that same standard in the next month of Pac-12 action.
“I’m ready,” Sarmiento said. “I’m ready to take on the challenge and prove that we’re the top team in the country.”

The Holberg Prize Academic Committee applauded Castells for his scholarly work on power in a “network society.”
“Castells has taken thinking about ‘the political’ to an entirely new level through his prescient account of the emergence of and interaction between new forms of power in the age of the network society,” the prize committee said.
Elizabeth Garrett, USC provost and senior vice president for academic affairs, said in a press release that the award highlights the importance of new means for communication.
“In receiving the prestigious Holberg Prize for his multidisciplinary work illuminating the transformative power of new communication technologies with respect to political and economic institutions, University Professor Castells clearly demonstrates why he has long occupied a preeminent position among his field’s most distinguished scholars,” Garrett said in a statement.
Though Castells’ primary appointment is in the Annenberg School of Communication & Journalism, he also holds positions in the sociology department, the School of International Relations and Sol Price School of Public Policy.
USC Annenberg Dean Ernest J. Wilson III said in a press release that Castells is an exemplary scholar and applauded him for receiving the honor.
“Manuel Castells is the preeminent example of a scholar who provides a deep and comprehensive understanding of how new communication breakthroughs impact our increasingly networked society,” Wilson said.

The unemployment rate for recently graduated undergraduate engineering students dropped from 6.4 percentage points in 2009 to 2 percent in 2011.
The gradual rebounding of the economy is influential in the sudden increase of jobs available to engineers, said Carl Martellino, executive director of the USC Career Center.
“As the economy begins to improve and companies begin to seek positive outlooks for their goods and services in the future, they’re going to start hiring engineers to build those goods and products,” Martellino said.
Engineers not only play an important role in the economic recovery but also help build and maintain the world’s infrastructure and technology, Dean of Viterbi Yannis Yortsos said.
“The world cannot work without engineers because engineers are very important for everything that we do,” Yortsos said. “The reason the economy rebounds is because engineering, computer science, information technology, all these things are driving the economy of the world and nowadays we live in an era in which intellectual property is what is the most important thing.”
Martellino said the field of engineering is constantly evolving and expanding to fit the needs of the economy.
“Engineering is one of those fields where there is constantly new creation and innovation, and when an economy expands you will tend to see both,” Martellino said. “You’re going to see jobs that already existed growing and you’re going to see new areas of innovation taking place too.”
Though the demand for engineers has increased, Yortsos said this will not negatively affect the quality of engineers.
“What we try to do is create people that are as competitive as possible because, you know, you want to make sure that you ride this wave, but at the same time are able to be ahead of it and create this additional value that is useful for the rest of your life, and be able to always innovate,” Yortsos said.
As a member of the executive board of the Dean’s Counsel — a group composed of every engineering dean from across the nation — Yortsos is working with President Barack Obama to have more recently graduated engineers hired to solve grand challenges through engineering. These grand challenges are grouped into four categories:  security, health, vulnerability and the joy of living.
“The question is: What are the big challenges of the future and how can engineers help solve these challenges,” Yortsos said. “The school of engineering, here at Viterbi, is supporting these and moving in how to energize the world about solving these grand challenges.”
It is a good time for undergraduate engineering students to be entering the job market, Martellino said.
“From the job seeker’s stand point, that rate is tremendous. That means you’re going to get signing bonuses and that means salaries will start to heat up,” Martellino said. “From the stand point of the student going out into the work world, it really is difficult for it to get much better, 2 percent and 0 percent are pretty close.”
URGENT: Please change the title and the link name.  The article states that engineering employment rates are *soaring*, not *dropping*.
you should probably change the title of the article so that its actually ACCURATE. Completely different than rest of the story. You probably mean UNemployment

After 36 years of service to the university, Director of Student Publications Mona Cravens was given the President’s Award for Staff Achievement, which honors long-time staff members for “outstanding contributions” to the school, on Thursday. A committee of staff members and President C. L. Max Nikias select the award’s recipient.

Cravens has been a member of the Trojan Family since 1976. Her initial involvement, however, happened by chance while she was visiting the campus with her husband Terry, a professor of winds and percussion at the Thornton School of Music.
“Ironic that [as] it is, I picked up a copy of the Daily Trojan and saw an ad for an on-campus advertising job,” Cravens said. “I’ve been here ever since.”
Before becoming director of student publications in 1982, her positions within the university and student publications have spanned everything from advertising manager to production assistant.
The students themselves are the part of the job Cravens cherishes most.
“That is part of the excitement of my job, being near all of you, who are constantly gathering the air of what is happening on our campus,” Cravens said. “I’ve worked with hundreds of students, thousands really, and I am in real awe and admire so many of their goals.”
Students who have become close to Cravens over the years remember the experience just as fondly as she does.
“Mona takes the time to get to know those she works with and takes a genuine, heartfelt interest in their well-being — even after they’re done at USC,” Kate Mather, a former editor-in-chief of the Daily Trojan, said.
Just as her title has changed over the years, Cravens has seen dynamic changes in Los Angeles. She recalls that the 1992 Los Angeles Riots were especially impactful.
“I didn’t think anything of that magnitude could materialize that quickly. The city was literally on fire,” Cravens said. “Going out on the streets after curfew was like coming up from underground after a nuclear holocaust.”
Because the riots happened on the outskirts of campus, classes and finals were canceled. The city-wide curfew restricted the movement of students so much that many stayed in the Lyon Center.
Cravens even brought a few students to her home near Pasadena for several days while the city calmed down.
Perhaps her strongest memory of the riots, however, is the special edition of the Daily Trojan that the editorial board put out the Monday after the riots.
“We felt it was so important to put this paper out,” Cravens said. “There’s a real history of commitment to the Daily Trojan.”
Many faculty and staff members said Cravens’ kindness, encouragement and mentoring have left a strong impression on many.
“There were a number of students that said if it weren’t for her they wouldn’t have graduated from ’SC and if it weren’t for her, they wouldn’t have made it to where they are today,” Larry Lim, director of pre-college programs at the Viterbi School of Engineering and last year’s recipient of the award said. “And all of this, of course, is above and beyond her regular daily work duties.”
Patrick Bailey, senior associate dean of students, said Cravens’ warmth has benefited the entire university.
“There are just so many lives she has touched since she’s been here,” Bailey said. “The university is a much better place for having someone like Mona here.”
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson said her contributions can be seen in the field of journalism outside of the university as well.
“Generations of outstanding journalists have been tutored and mentored by Mona and have gone on to terrific careers in journalism and other fields,” Jackson said in an email. “She is a USC treasure and it is appropriate that she be honored in this manner. It has been an honor to work with her and be tutored by her during my past 17 years at the university.”
Mona, Congratulations on your well-deserved honor and I thank you for your consistent support!

Several words come to mind when looking back on top-ranked USC’s exit as a semifinalist from the NCAA men’s volleyball tournament last May:
Premature, unsatisfying, disappointing.
Ask anyone related to the team and they’d say even these words remain a severe understatement. Losing to a fourth-seeded, 14-loss UC Santa Barbara team was not the ending anyone expected for a squad with 23 wins, the most in the Trojans’ storied history.
Strong cast · The 2012 Trojans are led by senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli. Despite losing players to graduation, the team is ranked No. 2. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
To add to the burn, the upset marked the departure of some of the best players to grace USC’s volleyball hardwood in quite some time.
Of course, the first that comes to mind is opposite hitter Murphy Troy, a four-year starter with a laundry list of accolades: two-time first team All-American, 2011 National and Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Player of the Year, USC rally-scoring era record holder for kills (1,902), aces (143), matches with double figure kills (101) and matches with 20-plus kills (32).
But Troy’s supporting cast was much more than capable in its own right. Joining him at graduation was setter Riley McKibbin, a 2011 first team All-American setter who ranked second in the nation in assists last spring, outside hitter Tri Bourne, a 2011 All-American third teamer, and four-year starting middle blocker Austin Zahn.
To make another understatement, those are big shoes to fill.
With the Gaucho’s four-set victory, it seemed as if the Trojans had missed their golden opportunity to bring home the team’s fifth national championship. But as attention was turned toward players on their way out, sixth-year USC coach Bill Ferguson remained focused on what lay ahead.
“Despite what it might appear to be, we would like to think of it as more of a case of reloading than rebuilding this year,” Ferguson said before this season started. “We have every reason to believe we can be among the teams playing in the Galen Center in early May.”
Now, with only one month left in the season, Ferguson has managed to recapture much of the momentum lost from 2011. Under his guidance, the Trojans currently rank No. 2 in the nation with a 16-4 record and an 11-4 mark in MPSF play. The team has gotten to that point riding an 11-game winning streak, which is one win short of tying the USC record for most consecutive victories, set by -— you guessed it — the 2011 team.
With five conference matches left, including one against No. 1 UC Irvine on April 7, the Trojans still have a ways to go before they can begin to think about an NCAA tournament run.
But considering the recent dominance USC has exhibited, entering the tournament ranked nationally in the top three is not, by any means, a long shot.
Senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli, a four-year starter and National Player of the Year candidate, has had a firm hand in the Trojans’ recent success. Ciarelli is tied for third in the nation in kills per set (4) and sixth in aces per set (.44). His team-high 265 kills and 30 aces put him on pace for his best season yet.
At his side is co-captain Steven Shandrick, a senior middle blocker that has recorded 73 blocks and 127 kills this season, and junior opposite hitter Maddison McKibbin, who has helped the Trojans to a perfect record since his return from a nagging ankle injury.
But in addition to its exceptional play, USC has one more advantage that could prove to be the tipping point in its quest to notch another title, something the 2011 team was forced to go without — home court advantage.
For the first time ever, USC will host the NCAA tournament at the Galen Center, giving the Trojans some much-needed home crowd support.
Considering the last three tournaments were in University Park, Penn., Stanford, Calif., and Provo, Utah, a five-minute walk to their home court is certainly a welcome sight for the youthful Trojans, who only have two seniors on the squad this year.
Of course, the goal of a national championship remains several weeks and many hard-fought matches away from becoming a reality. But if the first three months of the season are any indication, the Trojans are ready for the challenge.
And that might be the biggest understatement of them all.

Student organizers held a forum regarding the Trayvon Martin case on Thursday in Taper Hall, with the goal of raising student and community awareness concerning the incident.
Silence · Students congregated in front of Tommy Trojan on Thursday night for a candlelight vigil in honor of Trayvon Martin, who was killed in Stanford, Fla., earlier this month by a community watch member. - Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
Students and faculty affiliated with the I Am Trayvon Martin panel also held demonstrations near Tommy Trojan on Thursday, where they held hands and chanted their support for Martin and his family.
The I Am Trayvon Martin forum featured several USC professors and experts who discussed the legality of the case as well as the influence that racism and social injustice still have on our society.
Sharoni Little, an associate professor of clinical management communication, said the case demonstrates defects within our society’s laws because of its injustice to the victim.
“My concern is how we have logical people [agreeing] with the argument that a young 17-year-old boy can be killed in cold blood, and someone can get away with it,” Little said.
Amon Emeka, an assistant professor of sociology, said the Trayvon Martin case is another example of the killing of an innocent black man.
“As tragic as this particular case is, this case is systematic and has happened many other times,” Emeka said. “This case is something more influencing and far-reaching than just this particular incident.”
One of the student organizers of the forum, Christina Wilkerson, a senior majoring in sociology, said she helped organize the demonstrations and forum because she was a victim of the West 37th Place shooting in September 2011.
“I was a student who was shot at West 37th Place, and so the fact that someone could shoot someone else and then say self-defense when they’re the one that’s armed resonated with me on a personal level,” Wilkerson said. “[Trayvon Martin] could be any one of us on any day.”

Wilkerson also said it’s important for students in the USC community to get involved with the Trayvon Martin case because their activism will help spread the cause to ending racial violence.
“Oftentimes, the opportunity for us to do something is not there, so it’s important for students to get involved so they can say they participated in this social justice movement and that they made their voice heard,” Wilkerson said. “This event tomorrow is just a small step in a bigger movement.”
Ashley London, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said the Martin case should be important to all people because it shows the injustice that still exists in our society.
“As students we think a lot of problems that exist in our society have been solved, but the Trayvon Martin case shows that racism and injustice are still prevalent in our world,” London said. “[Events] like these are really important, because this is going to be history, and it’s important to be a part of the rallying and to get people to be aware.”

There is social injustice everywhere in the world. The US should really clean up their own act before preaching to other countries human rights etc. How can you tell others what to do if you are unable to do it yourself.
Don’t people have something better to do with their time?
haha….
Jeez you sound like an old man reading the newspaper during Jim Crow era protests

Nearly a month into spring practice, only one thing has remained constant for the USC football team — a long list of injured players, especially senior quarterback Matt Barkley’s favorite targets.
Playmaker · Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, who caught 11 touchdowns in 2011, has been one of the few healthy players this spring. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
With junior Robert Woods and sophomore George Farmer already sitting out, sophomore Marqise Lee once again emerged as the top receiving threat for the banged up USC offense on Thursday. He dominated drills, bulldozing past fellow receivers attempting to bump him off the line of scrimmage. He did, however, appear to be favoring an ankle at various points during practice, but continued to participate and didn’t seem to have sustained anything serious.
“Marqise is doing great,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We’re so hurt, and we’ve moved him around so much that he’s been playing every position because of Robert and George not being there. But it’s good for him.”
The tight end position — already a spot of concern for the Trojans — took another hit. Redshirt freshman Junior Pomee left on a cart with an apparent foot injury. He will likely join redshirt sophomores Xavier Grimble and Randall Telfer on the sidelines, although the severity of his injury is unknown.
“We can’t seem to keep a tight end healthy,” Kiffin said. “I’m a little disappointed in the hamstrings taking so long with a bunch of guys we’d really like to be looking at.”
Other injured players for the Trojans on Thursday included redshirt freshman cornerback Ryan Henderson, senior center Khaled Holmes and senior safety Drew McAllister. USC’s roster is so depleted that Kiffin is considering turning Saturday’s scheduled scrimmage at the Coliseum into a regular practice.
“There are so many guys in question, we may just practice like we did last Saturday,” Kiffin said.
With the offense missing several key parts, the Trojans shined on the defensive side of the ball when the two faced off. Other than a long run by redshirt sophomore tailback D.J. Morgan on a designed draw, Monte Kiffin’s defensive unit allowed few positive plays. Barkley threw his seventh interception of spring practice, this time to junior safety Demetrius Wright. Despite Barkley’s surprisingly high interception rate, his coach remains unfazed and completely confident in what the senior quarterback has to offer moving forward.
“It is abnormal for him,” Kiffin said. “I think it’s part of him getting a little bit bored. You know, he scrambles out and gets frustrated because he doesn’t have his normal guys in there and throws the ball downfield. So we’ll get him back out of it. We don’t like it but it’s not the end of the world. As we get closer to game time, we’ll get him back.”

Making its first-ever trips to Colorado and Utah this past weekend, the USC women’s tennis team came out victorious after notching back-to-back 7-0 sweeps and now they head home for a four-game homestand in Pac-12 play.
USC (14-2, 3-0) is set to face off against two conference foes this weekend, starting with Oregon at 1:30 p.m. on Friday and the No. 22 Washington Huskies Saturday at noon.
Building off of momentum from easy wins last week, the Women of Troy will once again need the bottom of their lineup to step up and provide the type of support that has been commonplace over the past few weeks.
Against the Utes, USC used the 4-6 positions to secure its landslide victory as senior Alison Ramos started singles with a punctuating win in the sixth slot, followed by a win from freshman Gabriella DeSimone on court 5 and a comeback victory by Kaitlyn Christian 5-7, 6-0, 6-0.
Facing Colorado, the Women of Troy duplicated their strong performance from early in the weekend, storming past the Buffaloes, first dominating doubles and then sweeping singles. Once again, Ramos started off the show with a win on court 6 and the rest of the USC squad followed in unison with five consecutive victories to end the match.
The two victories last weekend allowed the Women of Troy to head back to Marks Stadium with a chance for coach Richard Gallien to secure his 300th career victory as USC’s head coach at the place where it all started.
On top of that milestone, USC now has four players who have topped the 20-win mark this season. Led by freshman Zoe Scandalis and her 27-7 record, the Women of Troy also boast fellow freshman Sabrina Santamaria at 24-5 along with Christian and junior Danielle Lao with 22 and 21 wins, respectively.
With this strong core, along with the aforementioned strong bottom of the lineup that USC has, the Women of Troy will look to continue their trend of sweeping inferior opponents as the Ducks roll to town Friday. Without a top-100 player, Oregon (9-5, 0-4) will try to break their winless record over USC, which currently stands at 0-18.
On Saturday, the Huskies (6-7, 0-4) are coming off of back-to-back losses to Arizona and Arizona State and will seek to rebound against a strong USC squad. With No. 20 senior Denise Dy leading the Huskies’ attack, Scandalis should be tested on court 1, which could amount to Washington’s only victory of the day.
As long as the Women of Troy continue to start off strong and boast a potent backend of their lineup, they will remain an extremely tough match for any competitor.

USC baseball has proven it can win tough games on the road so far in the 2012 season.
Consecutive wins over Stanford and UC Irvine, both in unfriendly territory, have established a precedent the Trojans hope to follow during their weekend road trip to Pullman, Wash., to take on the Washington State Cougars.
Although USC is enjoying one of its best seasons in years thus far, the team is 2-4 in Pac-12 play, a record that won’t bode well if the team hopes to play beyond May.
The Cougars, however, have lost five out of their last eight games despite hitting .294 as a team. The Wazzu offense, which features sluggers outfielder Derek Jones (five home runs to lead the team) and first baseman Taylor Ard (four homers and 16 runs driven in), will face USC’s trio of weekend starters.
Senior pitchers Andrew Triggs and Ben Mount, along with freshman Stephen Tarpley, have all posted impressive strikeout-to-walk ratio, and Tarpley still has not registered a loss despite some command problems to begin the season.
Based on how USC coach Frank Cruz has lined it up all year, the Trojans will most likely go with Triggs on Friday, Mount Saturday and Tarpley to finish out the series on Sunday.
USC’s offense, meanwhile, has exceeded expectations as well. Despite losing two of three to powerhouse Stanford, the Trojans outscored the Cardinal in the series 12 to 11, no easy feat considering the Stanford pitching staff consists of three of the top starters in the country.
Washington State represents a crucial series for the Trojans. The Cougars are 10th in the conference, while USC stands at ninth, and USC would like to begin to distance itself from the bottom dwellers of the Pac-12.
First pitch on Friday is scheduled for 5 p.m., while Saturday and Sunday’s games are slated to begin at 2 p.m. and 11 a.m., respectively.

Studios could not be any happier with the box office success of The Hunger Games in its opening weekend, but the film is also greatly aiding the music industry through the release of its official soundtrack.

The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond came out March 20 and features a powerhouse of artists rallying behind the film, such as Taylor Swift, Maroon 5 and Kid Cudi. And the stacked lineup worked in the album’s favor, as it sold 175,000 copies in its first week, according to Nielsen Soundscan.
What will be interesting to keep an eye on is not the quality of the songs within the collection, but just how well the soundtrack of the upcoming blockbuster The Avengers does in comparison, simply because each soundtrack is home to a very specific genre.
The songs on The Hunger Games soundtrack have a very folksy, somber vibe to match themes of vulnerability, fighting for one’s life and protecting family in a dystopian society.
As such, many of the artists take a step back from their usually anthemic constructions in favor of songs that are almost haunting, where the trembling of the vocals drives the tracks more than anything else.
The songs are meant to capture the psyche of the troubled heroine, Katniss Everdeen. And it is quite easy to imagine Everdeen singing these tracks throughout the course of the film.
This soundtrack, however, is boring to anyone not heavily engrossed in the book series and movie. To fully appreciate the songs, one must understand the emotional turmoil of the protagonist. Without that understanding, the songs blend together as one compilation of formulaic folk songs that fail to provide mainstream appeal.
When it comes to The Avengers, the soundtrack is all about rock ‘n’ roll, the music chock full of fist-pumping choruses and good old-fashioned guitar riffs. And for a movie about the world’s greatest superheroes uniting to take down the bad guys, there could not be a more apropos track listing to back up all of that action.
The track listing, which was revealed March 26, will feature new songs from bands such as Papa Roach, Rise Against, Buckcherry, Black Veil Brides and Soundgarden, whose song, “Live to Rise,” is the band’s first new release in 15 years.
And though only a snippet of Soundgarden’s track has been released, it is safe to say that the songs on this disc will have a much more mainstream appeal. Essentially, these offerings will most likely be able to stand on their own as solid singles, whereas the songs from The Hunger Games soundtrack are really meant to go together as a whole.
All of this hypothesizing is not to say that there is more artistic merit in one release as compared to the other, it is to point out that the way each album performs on the Billboard charts will illustrate their appeal.
Music listeners tend to respond to songs based on their stand-alone value. In other words, a solid single released before an album will generate a good amount of hype, but the album sales generally never reach the number of single sales.
When it comes to compilations, there need to be multiple singles to entice people to buy the whole album. Though The Hunger Games soundtrack might have done well in its first week’s sales, music lovers would expect sales for The Avengers soundtrack, set for release May 1, to be much higher because the songs on that disc should all be radio-friendly.
The folk elements of songs from The Hunger Games, on the other hand, prevent them from being mainstream enough to generate such an enormous outpouring of support because they belong in the context of the whole album, not as radio singles.
It is unlikely that either release will come close to the merits of cinema’s most successful soundtrack, Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture. This album remained atop the Billboard charts for 16 consecutive weeks, was certified platinum 11 times and will most likely see a leap in sales after the film gets re-released in 3-D April 4.
Now, more than 12 years after the Titanic soundtrack’s iconic release, the world has two new blockbuster films with star-studded soundtracks behind them. But all signs point to The Avengers coming out on top, at least in terms of the music.

It’s no surprise that people prefer watching films in the comfort of their own homes.
The convenience that comes with watching a film at home on high-definition screens, along with the staggering prices of theater tickets, means that, for many viewers, a night in is better than going to a movie theater.
The theater experience, however, will always be unparalleled. There’s simply nothing like seeing one of Hollywood’s great films on the big screen accompanied by strangers in the dark. A number of theaters around Los Angeles that strive to offer the best for its viewers, and some of these venues might even have you wanting to go out this weekend.
Lights, camera, action · Though spending can add up, nothing compares to watching a film on the big screen. Be sure to check out Grauman’s Chinese Theatre (above), The Landmark and many more for great viewing experiences. - Armen Karaoghlanian | Daily Trojan
University Village’s Flagship Theatres welcomes students from the USC neighborhood, particularly because of its low prices. The theater doesn’t promise a unique experience, but it’s a perfect venue for a quick viewing of popular films.
ArcLight Cinemas, on the other hand, has become a popular choice for filmgoers who want quality, and the Hollywood location’s Cinerama Dome has become an icon of the city — fitting, considering ArcLight’s tagline is “Where movie lovers belong.”
The theater is geared toward passionate filmgoers; even its showtimes are presented on a departure board similar to that of an airport, as if to suggest that watching a film there will transport viewers into another world. ArcLight’s cafe offers great food and drinks, and for certain films, alcoholic beverages are welcome inside.
ArcLight’s general admission tickets run $13.75 and also include reserved seating, but audiences can save an additional dollar with free membership. Their membership program is one of the best in town; points are accumulated with each purchase and can be redeemed for free tickets and snacks. ArcLight screens mainstream films, independent and foreign films and often classics as well.
The Landmark, located between West Hollywood and Santa Monica, is another great stop, offering a wide selection of films in a great part of town. Like ArcLight Cinemas, the theater offers reserved seating, and prices are also very reasonable: Tickets are $12.50 during peak hours and $9.50 during non-peak hours.
Grauman’s Chinese Theatre is one of Hollywood’s most famous theaters. The theater is located on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, where you can see the stars of famous actors as well as their handprints and footprints. The location lends itself to a great experience, especially because of its proximity to the Hollywood and Highland Center.
This experience, however, comes with a price tag. The Chinese Theatre’s tickets are as high as $19, but considering its prime location in an iconic part of Hollywood, it’s worth the splurge.
In front of the Chinese Theatre sits the El Capitan Theatre, a beautiful movie palace that specializes in Disney films. The theater screens new film releases but also shows memorable classics. Several perks are also offered, such as VIP admission, which includes reserved seats, popcorn and a drink, and from time to time, the El Capitan hosts special events in which audiences can have breakfast with a Disney character.
The Vista Theatre is one of Hollywood’s hidden treasures, and many people might be unaware of its relationship to cinema history. The theater stands on the former site of the Babylon set that was prominently featured in Intolerance, one of cinema’s greatest silent films and one whose architecture later inspired the Hollywood and Highland Center’s design.
The Vista is a single-screen theater located on Hollywood and Sunset boulevards, and is currently screening the box office hit The Hunger Games.
There are several art-house theaters in the area as well, for those interested in touching up on cinema of the past. The Egyptian Theatre often hosts particularly well-known and respected films, such as Gone with the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia and 2001: A Space Odyssey, while New Beverly Cinema often focuses on foreign films and cult favorites. New Beverly Cinema, which only accepts cash, charges $8. This fee gets you in for two films on its double bill feature.
Even with all these options, if location means a great deal in terms of how you enjoy films, the best out of the bunch is arguably ArcLight Cinemas. Hollywood attracts many on its glamour alone, and the theater’s reserved seating, famed caramel popcorn and wide selection of films — both independent and mainstream — leave audiences with little desire to go anywhere else.

When Julia Roberts got a phone call about the possibility of being cast in a new live-action movie based on the Snow White fable, she dismissed it right away.
It’s off to work we go · Though director Tarsem Singh’s new Mirror Mirror maintains the same basic plot as the original Snow White fairy tale, it features a new spin on some of its subplots, including that of the seven dwarfs. Unlike the Disney tale, where Snow White’s friends work as miners, Singh’s dwarfs take on a Robin Hood persona and teach Snow White to steal from the rich. - Photo courtesy of EPK.TV
“I had no interest in some fairy tale movie — I didn’t even consider it at the time,” Roberts said with a laugh.
In many ways, her response made perfect sense. For what reasons would Roberts, a seasoned, award-winning screen veteran, be interested in a project like this? Up until that point, fairy tales on the big screen had almost been the exclusive territory of Disney’s animation department. A project like this seemed strange to Roberts, and the only reason she ended up going in for an audition was because of the director attached to the project: Tarsem Singh.
Singh, director of The Immortals and The Fall, has been noted for crafting visually arresting films. Roberts was a big fan of his work — and Singh reciprocated that enthusiasm.
“The first part I had cast in my head was Julia Roberts as the evil queen — Snow [White] and the prince, they all came later, but I knew who I wanted was Julia right away,” Singh said.
With Singh’s insistence, and the realization that his vision was much different than what the actress had originally imagined, Roberts quickly signed on for the project. It’s a good thing she did, because she captures the heart and soul of the movie.
As the sassy, controlling and evil queen, Roberts is the center of attention whenever she is on screen, treating everyone around her with an unmistakable bite. It is not a role audiences are probably used to seeing Roberts in, as she’s generally cast in roles significantly more good-natured.
Roberts said that it wasn’t difficult to make the transition, as the part was so much fun for her to tackle. The only time she encountered any trouble was when she had to direct some especially mean lines at her co-star Lily Collins, who portrays Snow White.
“It was like yelling at Bambi,” Roberts said. “She was just there looking up at me looking adorable and I’m just saying all these things to her. I wanted to give her a big hug afterwards.”
Off the screen, the two stars had a good relationship, with Collins gushing about Roberts at every opportunity.
“I was so thrilled that I would actually be working with Julia Roberts,” Collins said. “When we got on the set, I saw how great she was in all of our scenes and how great of a mother she was and it really helped me feel comfortable.”
Roberts was right in her description of Collins as “adorable” — the young actress is a slam dunk in the lead role. Collins, with her innocent aura and immediate beauty, is exactly the kind of girl viewers would imagine portraying a princess who sings with birds and befriends outcast dwarves.
Mirror Mirror follows the story of Snow White that many people have come to know well. The evil queen, Snow White’s stepmother, is desperate to find a rich husband to help pay the debts accrued from her lavish lifestyle, which has left her kingdom in poverty. The queen starts pursuing Prince Charming — played by Armie Hammer of Social Network fame — using her charms, spells and persistence. The queen grows jealous of his attention toward Snow White, however, and orders her to be killed. Left alone in the woods, Snow White finds the seven dwarfs and befriends them.
In Mirror Mirror, however, the seven dwarfs are not miners, as in the 1937 Disney movie, but rather bandits who steal from the rich à la Robin Hood. They are quite successful at this task, using stilts, swords and traps, and end up teaching Snow White their ways. In the process, Mirror Mirror portrays a Snow White story that audiences have never seen before.
According to Singh, this change is not something to fear.
“The story of Snow White has been around for centuries. Yes, some things are changed from the Disney version, but a lot of things were changed for that one as well,” Singh said. “In the original story, the queen is Snow White’s mother — something that doesn’t sit as well when she starts to want her killed. Fairy tales are adapted to the times they are told in.”
Singh is correct in this assessment, as his visually arresting, comical and updated vision of Snow White is perfect for modern viewers.
It seems, then, that Roberts made the right choice by reconsidering the role.

The killing of Trayvon Martin last month temporarily united both political parties, as President Barack Obama and GOP presidential candidates lamented the teenager’s death.
The issue has become politicized, however, as the debate over whether Florida’s Stand Your Ground self-defense law was responsible for Martin’s death.
The law itself has been put on the defensive as George Zimmerman managed to avoid prosecution by claiming that he shot Martin in self-defense.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
Regardless of whether Zimmerman believed his actions were protected by the Stand Your Ground law, it is imperative that citizens have the right to protect themselves by use of force if they are attacked.
Following a 39-0 vote in the Florida Senate, then-Gov. Jeb Bush signed Stand Your Ground into law in 2005. The law grants citizens the right to use lethal force in self-defense if an attacker threatens them “unlawfully and forcefully.” Unless authorities can prove the person did not act in self-defense, that person is immune to criminal prosecution and civil suit under the law.
The high-profile and tragic nature of the Martin case has prompted the GOP presidential field to not only extend their condolences but to defend the vilified Florida law as compatible with a pro-gun rights agenda.
In an interview with Piers Morgan last week, Newt Gingrich stated that the law should not be applicable to the case. Gingrich opined that Zimmerman’s pursuit of Martin was not about “[standing] your own ground” but about “[chasing] the other person into their ground.”
Though Gingrich is right to assert that we do not know the full details of what happened, Martin’s unjust and untimely death should not be attributed to the law.
Putting aside the important question of whether Zimmerman acted in self-defense, the idea behind Florida’s law should be codified in every state as an affirmation of our constitutional right to bear arms.
Government has shown time and time again that it cannot be relied upon for everything. We must be especially cautious in guarding our lives instead of depending on the government to do it for us. The police are not infallible.
This is not to say that guns should be passed out on street corners. People should meet certain requirements before they can access firearms. But once they are legal gun owners, they should be able to use them to defend their lives.
There is no question that what happened to Martin is utterly horrible, but we cannot allow opportunistic political rhetoric to blame his death on anything other than the actions of a depraved man.

Politicians and ordinary citizens alike have weighed in on the recent death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. But rhetoric aside, the fact remains that an American teenager was murdered last month — and faulty arms legislature is letting his killer go free.
Christina Ellis | Daily Trojan
George Zimmerman evaded arrest because of a law passed by the Florida legislature in 2005. The Stand Your Ground law stipulates that a person attacked in any place “has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so.”
Though there is nothing inherently wrong with expanding the right to self-defense, this law introduces a dangerous technicality into the investigation of those who commit gun crimes.
How do you contest someone’s “reasonable belief” that his life was in danger? How do you evaluate a shooting based on the mental state of the person involved?
Ambiguities inevitably arise in the American justice system, but it is the responsibility of lawmakers to reduce their occurrence as much as possible.
Martin’s death represents a call to legislators at the state and federal level to re-examine our laws involving self-defense and gun control.
In a press conference last week, President Barack Obama stated, “It is absolutely imperative that we investigate every aspect of this, and that everybody pulls together — federal, state and local.” He called specifically not only for an examination of the incident but an examination of the relevant laws as well.
Compared with much of the world, the United States has a fairly liberal gun policy. Many commentators justify these policies on the grounds of the Second Amendment, which grants all citizens the right to bear arms.
But at what point does this right infringe upon the even more fundamental right to life?
A study conducted by the New England Journal of Medicine in 1993 shows that gun ownership acts as a risk factor for homicide in the home.
Countless news stories from the past several decades remind us of its more specific dangers: school shootings, fatal accidents involving young children and family member suicides.
And with many states allowing gun owners to carry their guns on their persons, a distinct class of trigger-happy vigilantes has emerged.
These laws lead to scenarios such as the Martin shooting, in which a gunshot somehow becomes the appropriate response to a minor altercation.
People have the right to defend themselves — but this right has a flip side.
One should be allowed to purchase a gun for protection, but strict and specific legislation is necessary to protect the unarmed among us.

To understand the Trayvon Martin vs. George Zimmerman case, you need to listen to the recorded phone call made by the neighbor to 911.
The fatal shot is heard during this call.
Merely listen to it.
Then draw your own conclusions.
No need for experts.  No need for pundits.  No need even for an open mind.
Just listen to the haunting call.
A transcript won’t do.  It must be heard.
Here it is:  http://soundclick.com/share.cfm?id=11548279
Francesca, if you are upset that law enforcement officials ruled that George Zimmerman complied with Florida law the night Trayvon Martin died, your beef is with the “legislation” (not the “legislature.” You should doublecheck your text before you post.) If Zimmerman is free due to the fact that he complied with the law, then he has not “evaded” arrest. You may mean that you think he “avoided” arrest, but that is not what you said.
Francesca, I applaud your statement that you support a right to life. I do, too. Life is precious. Every life is precious. Do you value the lives of unborn babies as much as you value Trayvon’s life? They are no different, by the way. If you want the Florida Stand Your Ground law done away with, will you also be advocating for an end to legalized abortion on demand? Unborn babies are human beings, too.
All the “rhetoric” you want to put aside seems to be about a label called “race.” People are spouting rhetoric that this is a “racial” crime and that Zimmerman is guilty of “racism.” If we really value life and consider every human life of equal value, then should we not decree an end to the use of the words, “race,” “racism,” and “racist?” I value every human being, and when people ask my race, I answer “human.” How do you answer that question?
Much of this article conflates the right to keep and bear arms with an imagined right to shoot people.  This is not the case.  Even though there is a right to keep (meaning “to own”) and bear (meaning “to carry”) firearms, all usage of firearms is subject to police investigation, and rightly so.
The author is attempting to indict the legitimacy of the 2nd Amendment by equating the effects of illegal activities with a newly emergent civil right.
“How do you contest someone’s “reasonable belief” that his life was in danger? How do you evaluate a shooting based on the mental state of the person involved?”
That is for a judge & jury to determine….  The law was designed so that if I have a legal right to be in a place and I am being attacked I have the right to defend myself and if by defending myself I have to shoot the other person in order for the attack to stop, so be it.

It’s nice to know that Fiona Apple is coming back.
When she first hit the scene with her debut album, the multi-platinum Tidal, she was 19-years-old, a frail-looking waif of a girl with enormous, haunting eyes and a powerful, throaty voice that surprised listeners and defied the tiny body from which it came. But Apple crooned and shouted and spat and lulled her way into the hearts of listeners and she became a household name.
And then things slowed down for a while. She didn’t go on an official hiatus, but the absence of albums and EPs for nearly a decade left some fans feeling high and dry. But now she is finally reemerging. Her first album in seven years, The Idler Wheel is wiser than the Driver of the Screw, and Whipping Cords will serve you more than Ropes will ever do, is scheduled to be released this June. If this is a mouthful for anyone, the album is also more simply known as The Idler Wheel. The extensive, poetic title is reminiscent of Apple’s second studio album, which has a title that would take up a third of this entire blog.
There is of course a lot of buzz over the return of Apple. Her last and third studio album, Extraordinary Machine, was marked by strife and disputations. There were rumors of disputes over commercial appeal of Extraordinary Machine, which was shelved for several years due to the producers’ inability to pinpoint a potential single. Followed by seven years of no new material, it looked like she might never return.
Her restart has been a bit bumpy, with “new” material floating around for a long time, but she has started performing her new songs at venues and also kicked off a small, spring tour on March 14, marking her first tour outside of Los Angeles in 5 years. Apple has come a long way in the last 15 years from Tidal, which was home to her phenomenal early hit “Criminal.” If she crafted songs like that at 19, imagine what she’ll have to offer on her mature and upcoming The Idler Wheel.
