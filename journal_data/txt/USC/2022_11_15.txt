The No. 3 Trojans fell to crosstown rival No. 2 UCLA 14-13 in a nail-biting conference final over the weekend, marking their third loss to the Bruins this season. The contest went into overtime after the Bruins snuck in a goal with three seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, and in the final moments of overtime play UCLA struck again to take the win. 
After dominating Stanford last weekend, USC entered Spieker Aquatics Center, feeling confident in enemy waters. Trojan fans packed the stands, breaking up the blue and yellow with cardinal and gold. But skillset and support weren’t what decided this game  — it was time. 
“It’s always a big game against UCLA… especially on their senior day you want to take it from them at their own house,” said freshman utility Andrej Grgurevic. “Before the game you’re really pumped up to play them – it’s a full crowd, the bands playing – you really want to get in and play and it’s just a different mindset.” 
Across all four quarters, USC and UCLA tied nine times – proving how even the competition was the entire game. The Trojans moved swiftly between catching up and pulling ahead for the entire game, and graduate student driver Massimo Di Martire was a key part of USC’s success. With four goals, DiMartire brought his season total up to 50 goals for his first season. The last time over 50 goals were scored in one season was with Jacob Mercep in 2019, where he scored 51. 
Alongside Di Martire in lead scoring was redshirt sophomore utility Joshua Waldoch, who ended the outing with four goals. Waldoch, alongside junior 2-meter Max Miller, helped the Trojans climb out of a two-goal deficit in the first quarter. Waldoch also bumped USC into a lead in the third quarter after a counter from junior driver Carson Kranz. 
USC entered the fourth quarter with a narrow lead, only up by one point. After the Bruins came back to tie it up, the Trojans took off. Three goals later, thanks to junior 2-meter Tony Nardelli, redshirt senior driver Ashworth Molthen, and redshirt senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt, USC had gained the largest lead in the game thus far. With less than a minute and a half remaining in the game, UCLA was down three goals and in need of a miracle to come back. 
Their miracle came in the form of a 7-on-6 offensive play, where the Bruins goalie subbed out for a field player and forced USC into a zone defense. UCLA repeated this method for three offensive possessions, forcing the game into overtime play. 
The rivals battled for five minutes and 57 seconds before a goal was scored by the Bruins to win the game. Grgurevic could only describe the final moments of the game as overwhelming with emotion. 
“To think you have already won the game with a minute to go and then be down, it’s indescribable,” he said. 
While the scoreboard reflected a loss for the Trojans, Head Coach Marko Pintaric believed that USC’s performance outshined the Bruins in the end. The Trojans defense, especially in the final moments of high-pressure games, has been their Achilles’ heel this season, according to Pintaric. 
“To allow three goals with 7-on-6 is unacceptable,” Pintaric said. “The game was excellent, I’m proud of the guys [and] the way they played, but we need to play better defense.” 
The Trojans will return home to Uytengsu Aquatics Center to host the MPSF Tournament next weekend, with games running Friday November 18 through Sunday November 20. USC’s first contest is against Austin College Friday at 2:45 p.m.

Chatter quickly filled the courtyard outside Town and Gown as industry professionals and students trickled into USC’s Construction Management Association of America annual symposium Monday night. With talks ranging from the meaning of the 21st-century construction industry to advice for upcoming graduating seniors, over 20 companies and a hundred students were in attendance. 
This year marked the 27th anniversary of the symposium, which provided students the opportunity to network and hear from industry professionals in the fields of construction, architecture, engineering and more. The theme for the night — Imaginative Innovation — centered around the presentation of Los Angeles’s upcoming Lucas Museum of Narrative Art, which is scheduled to open in 2025 and showcase the power of visual storytelling.
The symposium began with a dinner and cocktail hour, then moved into a panel and question-and-answer session with professionals involved in the museum project, including keynote speakers Angelo Garcia, president of Lucas Real Estate Holdings, and Principal at Stantec Michael Siegel, who each shared their respective roles and the development of the museum.
Yannis Yortsos, dean of the Viterbi School of Engineering, gave one of the opening remarks for the event, sharing his appreciation for the symposium and its continuing legacy.
“This event is unique among all our other disciplines,” Yortsos said in his opening speech. “It’s the only department/event that has this ability to pull together engineers in a way that they network with each other and celebrate achievement innovation.” 
The symposium was completely student-run and hosted by USC’s CMAA branch, an organization aimed at providing career preparation resources for students interested in pursuing careers in the construction management field. This year’s symposium was co-chaired by Nina Zanghi, a senior majoring in environmental engineering, and Katherine Moir, a senior majoring in civil engineering with an emphasis in building science, who were part of the executive board tasked with organizing and planning the event. 
For Zanghi, the goal of CMAA and the event is to create community and provide students with career-building opportunities. 
“Our whole job [as part of CMAA] is to focus on civil engineering students or other students interested in construction, building or project management,” Zanghi said. “We take them [in] and give them opportunities such as information sessions, talk[ing] one on one with recruiters … This event is all about networking and giving out scholarships to a lot of these kids.”  
The symposium, Viterbi’s largest event, marked the first time the Lucas Museum was presented to the public and included an in-depth discussion of how the project came to be, including its location across the street from USC. 
“We really loved the Lucas Museum and we’ve seen it go up. It’s been in construction for a very long time, and we were very excited about it. We were really hoping to get [the museum] and are happy we were able to convince them to present it here tonight,” Zanghi said. “[The museum] is so close to USC, and George Lucas is such a big part of [the University’s history]. We thought it would be really cool to bring it all together.”  
Zanghi’s biggest hope for the night is that it helped students learn a new perspective around the construction industry.
“Some people think construction is just boring and not anything exciting, but it is, and our goal is helping students understand that and make connections,” she said. “We want to help people build their own careers and hopefully continue with our club and become leaders in it later on.”
The event also brought together alumni and industry professionals from throughout the L.A. area, many choosing to participate due to their past experiences with the association. 
“Coming to the events when I was younger in college was really helpful to recognize names of contractors and to hear presentations about the field,” said Junco Nelson, one of the industry professionals attending the event. “I remember when I was a sophomore, [the symposium] was about the redevelopment of Exposition Park, and I learned a lot about the actual neighborhood of USC, which was really helpful.”
Getting the chance to talk to and learn more about the construction industry is exactly what has kept Jacqueline Chen, a senior majoring in civil engineering, coming back to the symposium over the last two years.
“I think my favorite part is just casually and informally talking with the industry representatives sitting around me, along with listening to the speakers of the event talking about a project that they themselves are involved in and passionate about,” Chen said. “Just them talking about what they’re involved in gives me insight on what the contract industry is like, and what I can do in the future.”
The night ended in joy for many CMAA members. The event annually distributes scholarships to distinguished students of the organization, with this year’s awards reaching over $25,000 worth. Among the winners was Elleanna Biller, a sophomore majoring in business administration, who won the USC CMAA Lower Classman Scholarship. 
Biller said she was truly grateful to be able to be a part of CMAA and receive the award. 
“I’m so excited. I first heard of CMAA earlier this semester when they came into my class for real estate development. I want to go into affordable housing and that construction is a big part of that,” Biller said. “I wrote about that in my application.” 
The event awarded six scholarships in total, including to Zanghi and CMAA’s president, Natalie Le, a senior majoring in civil engineering. 
“The larger payoff is nights like tonight … when I see students making connections, and old friends in the industry catching up all because of the hard work that our symposium co-chairs and the rest of our executive board put in all year,” Le said at the close of the event. “There’s no other event that feels as special as the symposium is, and I hope we can all come together to further explore and celebrate the industry that connects us all.”

There was a time when I wouldn’t post or show others a picture of myself without adding a filter of some sort. Sometimes those social media filters were cute and funny, like me as a digitally rendered strawberry or as a puppy. Mostly, though, those filters were intended to present an alternate, often extreme version of myself: someone with lighter skin, bigger eyes and less blemished skin. In my world where colorism and flawed beauty standards reigned supreme, I needed to make myself conform to those standards through the digital arts. 
I became addicted to such filters, to the point where seeing myself in the mirror without them became a shock. I’m not sure if my consistent use of filters contributed to my omnipresent insecurities or if my omnipresent insecurities were what led me to keep using filters, but  regardless of the root cause, my social media life was dependent upon these photo filters. 
Looking back, I don’t think I realized how unreal my filtered photos were. No one (except for anime characters) had eyes that big, and the use of all these different artistic effects meant that my face as a whole didn’t even look like my face anymore. Still, I was blissfully unaware and continued sharing these photos, convinced that people would see me the way I represented myself online rather than my actual face in real life. 
According to Tate Ryan-Mosely of the MIT Technology Review, many young girls feel the same pressure when it comes to filters. Such augmented reality filters, Ryan-Mosely writes, enable social media users to “sift through different identities” and represent themselves in ways that aren’t reflective of who they actually are. 
Genesis Rivas at InStyle echoes this argument about the misrepresentative implications of filters. She writes that such aesthetic-centered effects are based upon “highlighting Euro-centric beauty features, like lighter eyes,” and overall have incredibly detrimental impacts on mental health. 
Rivas also cites medical studies that show the correlation between digital filters and people getting plastic surgery to appear more like the filtered versions of themselves. Social media filters geared towards perpetuating unattainable beauty standards are also linked to an increase in cases of body dysmorphia, anxiety and isolation. 
Besides the societal beauty standards and inequities that such filters are often associated with, there’s also evidence to show that some filters are a product of racialized perceptions. Back in 2016, Snapchat came under fire for its filter that perpetuated racist stereotypes of Asians as excessively squinty-eyed. Many called the filter a form of “yellowface.” 
Even before that, Snapchat’s Bob Marley filter, which allowed users to insert their face into Bob Marley’s, incited widespread rage. It was labeled as racist and a means of “digital blackface.” 
Caitlin Dewey at the Washington Post argues that many digital filters do perpetuate negative racial attitudes in how these filters perceive and illustrate racial identities. There’s a particular pattern of blackface through platforms such as Face Swap, where users can swap their faces with Barack Obama’s, or Face Swap Booth, where users can visually take on the face of Nicki Minaj. 
I know that I’m meant to write about animation and the digital arts. Still, at this point, I wouldn’t even consider such filters “art.” If anything, these examples show how the positive ability to creatively render visuals in an artistic fashion — what I consider a brilliant form of what the “digital arts” should mean — have no longer become creative. Filters have been warped in a negative manner. Under that problematic definition of digital filters, people just try on the face of any real person they want. 
Although it’s clear that filters have become a complicated phenomenon, I want to stress that I still love using filters at most times. They’re a really powerful creative tool, especially for the artists and creators who dream them up. For others, filters allow a degree of creative agency, even if that agency is often overshadowed by the blurring between art and life. 
Filters have opened up a range of possibilities to become who — or what — I could literally only dream of becoming. I’m not opposed to becoming a strawberry or a puppy again; I still like seeing myself as a different, hilarious version of myself. I also have to admit that I’d probably still use filters to lessen a particularly large pimple on my face. 
I’m not so sure that I’d start using beauty filters to the extreme extent that I did before, though. I think it’s important to recognize that many filters do have implicit meanings beyond their surface-level visuals. More than just images, filters represent a form of reality that may occasionally feel inviting. That reality just isn’t ours.

Seamlessly jumping genres and switching gears, beabadoobee is a masterful young musician with a unique sound that takes the best offerings of past incarnations of indie rock and fuses it with the soulful, angelic indie and bedroom pop sounds of today.
Before the revelation that was last Saturday night at The Novo in downtown Los Angeles, I had only heard a single beabadoobee song in my life. It was, of course, Powfu’s wildly popular “Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head),” on which beabadoobee’s song “Coffee” was sampled. Powfu’s remix took TikTok and the world by storm in 2020, earning over one billion plays on Spotify.
With her instantly quotable lyrics, graceful playful melodies and refreshing new rock sound, beabadoobee, whose real name is Beatrice Laus, quickly rose to prominence in the indie streaming world. Today, Bea (as her fans lovingly refer to her as) already sells out venues across the nation — L.A. included. Next year, she will open for Taylor Swift’s “The Eras” Tour in massive stadiums in several cities across America. With this gig on the horizon, she will only be getting bigger from here.
However, before beabadoobee took the stage, audience members were treated to a performance by Lowertown, an electronic and lo-fi group based in Atlanta, Georgia that has been on the road with Bea for the past few weeks. Consisting of members Olive Osby and Avshalom Weinberg, their set consisted of hard, energetic tunes that had the whole crowd rocking their heads along. With the star presence and aura of any legendary classic rock group, Lowertown commanded the stage and embraced the senses with passion and power.
“The audiences are always really loving and really open to new things, which is great. It’s nice to get really close with a tight-knit group of people. But, we’re still very much finding ourselves as people,” Weinberg said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “This is the most intense form of being perceived. You’re sort of pushed into hyperdrive to find yourself and your self-image.”
While the band takes inspiration from iconic bands of the past such as Radiohead, Lowertown’s music and stage presence is undeniably their own.
“It’s really easy to get influenced by what’s blowing up right now,” Osby said. “But that stuff is always changing. What doesn’t change is stuff you authentically make. It ages better and feels better.”
After Lowertown’s electric performance, Bea put on an utterly enthralling show, one that perfectly balanced delicate intimate moments with bursts of communal joy. During songs like “Ripples,” concertgoers felt a taste of her earlier years — just a girl and her acoustic guitar, a single spotlight shining on a dark stage. For songs such as “Last Day On Earth” and “Cologne,” Bea and the whole band brought the house down and lit up the stage with a celebration of colors and explosion of sound. There was a wonderful glow and haze to it all. A feeling of love and comfort. A safe space was created.
The energy in the audience was spectacular. One look around would assure you that she truly meant the world to these fans. Screaming, jumping, dancing, crying. Beat after beat, song after song. The crowd was roaring when she first walked on, and those roars didn’t die down until the very end. The passion and love in the room was palpable. Bea was all in from the very start, having the time of her life with her wonderful musicians with plenty of winks, grins and riffs to go around.
This past Saturday night, L.A. witnessed a rockstar in the making, with a very thrilling and hopeful sound: something new, something awesome, something warm and exciting. Here was an artist that truly connected with her fans. And in a few short hours, beabadoobee had a brand new fan in me too. 
Here’s the tea: “Coffee” was not the work of a one-hit wonder. beabadoobee is a force to be reckoned with.

A lavender, pink and orange gradient check-in table at the forefront, surround sound of Billboard Top 100 hits, clothes made of Legos on display to the left paired with a bracelet-making station, photo opportunities with Freeform’s pop-ups, paired with beauty goodies in the bathrooms; a colorful and energetic exuberance welcomed changemakers from around the world passionate about invigorating the next generation.
The heart of Hollywood drew in heaps of young adults to Teen Vogue’s 2022 Summit & Block Party Saturday with inspiring keynote speakers like Lilly Singh, Keke Palmer and Saweetie alongside empowering inclusive panels discussing Gen-Z’s role in politics, fashion, beauty and self-care. The dynamic event included performances from “I Am” rapper Baby Tate and “Nonsense” singer Sabrina Carpenter.
The energy was electric as some of the greatest and youngest actors, political activists, designers and media creators congregated in the yard outside of Goya Studios. 
Olivia Julianna, an abortion rights activist and the director of politics and government affairs at Gen-Z for Change, joined Santiago Mayer, the executive director of Voters of Tomorrow, and Allegra Kirkland, politics director at Teen Vogue, in a conversation energizing the young audience to engage in politics — from a national scale down to the local level. With the event coming less than a week after the midterm elections, Mayer mentioned that young voters “canceled out every single vote that was cast by people over 65 years old.”
Julianna shared her experience rewriting the narrative for harmful sexist and fatphobic bullying rhetoric being a political weapon. After Florida Representitive Matt Gaetz fatshamed her, Julianna chose to use the publicity to raise over $2 million in abortion funds earlier this year.
“If I was looking at myself when I was 11 or 12, how can I tell that young girl, ‘I’m gonna cower away and cry because of what this jackass is saying about me?’” Julianna said. “So many parts of our identities are being attacked. I’m very upfront with the fact that I’m an openly queer, Latina, plus-sized woman. Living in the state of Texas, it’s not easy. Every facet of my identity is attacked regularly. So, by highlighting my identities instead of hiding them, that’s a form of resistance. Your joy is resistance. Keep that in mind.”
With her charismatic personality, USC alumna Saweetie took the stage as one of the event’s keynote speakers. Similarly to Julianna, she spoke on fighting against online harassment. For Saweetie, she takes the hate and social media lies and turns it into her art.
“I don’t defend myself through tweets. I’m gonna go to the studio and I’m gonna get that shit out. I feel like that’s what the music is for. Tell your truth in the music,” she said. “I’m not about to go back and forth with a lie on social media. I’m not about to argue with somebody on social media. I’m putting that energy into my music and not online to where I ain’t get no money from it.”
While she is working up to releasing her new album, “The Single Life,” Saweetie highlighted the importance of working hard but also taking time to enjoy the journey of reaching your ultimate goals. Over time, the rapper has learned to “appreciate the dark moments and appreciate the light moments.”
“Celebrate those little and those big moments, because you should always celebrate yourself,” she said.  “As long as you give your 100%, you should pat yourself on the back.”
Throughout the day, there was not a moment of downtime. If the panels weren’t speaking, L.A. based food trucks, Lime Truck, Vegan AF and LA Donut, provided attendees with delectable treats while they mingled with fellow guests, swapping stories about the day and making new friends. 
“Take advantage of being around people that like to do the same things you like to do,” said Camila Bustamante. “Build a community around it, make it fun.” 
Bustamante is a member of Teen Vogue’s Generation Next Class of 2022, an award given to emerging fashion designers. Five of the Generation Next designers were featured in a “playing with fashion” panel, moderated by Teen Vogue Editor-in-Chief Versha Sharma. Stella DeLaughter, another member of the class, said she hoped the talk pushes forward the future of fashion, which she imagines to be “more relatable.” 
“I think sometimes fashion can seem a bit pretentious and unreachable,” DeLaughter said. “It’s easier for people to be invited into fashion when they see themselves being represented.” 
The crowd for the Teen Vogue event was, unsurprisingly, mostly teens. In the large crowd of young adults were a group of friends wearing shirts that read CondéFuture. These New York teens are taking part in a two-year internship at Condé Nast, the publisher of Teen Vogue along with other magazines such as The New Yorker and Vanity Fair, and learn different media skills in hopes of a future career with the brand. 
Sanai Rashid, a CondéFuture member, spoke about the importance of creating spaces for young activists and creatives to connect. 
“The amount of different walks of lives that have come here today, from different states, different areas, whatever creative interests, it’s just really inspiring to see how many amazing changemakers there are in this society already,” Rashid said.

Running this column has been an immense honor and privilege. The opportunity to write in such a welcoming space for a wide and deeply impassioned readership is a rare one that I often doubt I will ever receive again. 
I remember, back in July or August, riding my high horse into the Daily Trojan opinion section’s Google Form application with the idea for this column in mind. I knew how frustrating it felt to identify with a country whose politics so drastically shaped my family, but was otherwise completely irrelevant here in the United States. I also knew there were many others like me who felt the same way. This column was a way to relieve myself of that frustration, and while I won’t pretend to have been some harbinger of representation for all the blank-hyphen-Americans and international folks of this great University, I do hope this column has brought some degree of comfort to you as well.
I would like to end this column — at least for the semester — with a couple FAQs and some final thoughts.
What’s even “outside Western interests” anyway?
It is true that the West has a stake in almost anywhere the sun rises in the morning and sets in the evening, in terms of resources and economic opportunities. What they couldn’t care less about are the people and the infrastructures that inhabit those places — that is, so long as said people don’t appoint governments the West dislikes (see: Syria, Costa Rica, Vietnam, Cuba, etc.). My intent with the column is to bring the focus back to the people, to whom I believe the power and attention do and should belong.
It is also a flaw of news outlets that they often rely on governments to be reliable representations of their people. Look no further than the concussion-inducing coverage of last Tuesday’s midterm elections: So much talk about this seat and that seat in the Senate and House, while voters are treated as mere numbers and statistics in a larger politicians’ game of chess. I couldn’t help but notice a severe disconnect between the passion and urgency of those pundits and the general apathy of every other sane American. Earlier, I wrote of elections as being this lunatic versus that lunatic, and this time was no different. The “second highest voter turnout among voters under 30 in at least the past three decades” means nothing, really: We have only seen the lunatics that will take office if we didn’t at least do something about it. 
How do you conduct research for columns when most news sources we consider to be reputable are mostly Western outlets? What even is a reputable news source?
This is something I continue to struggle with. Foreign affairs has a steep learning curve. The limited English-language outlets that do cover it either obsess over Russia and China, as does the aptly named Foreign Affairs magazine, or they devote a singular correspondent to an entire country’s politics, only for their articles to get buried in a wave of more relevant news. And on what grounds do I cross-examine the various reports and claims these outlets make, especially when I can’t read a native-language newspaper? 
I had a pitch about Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, having an efficient metro system where trains come every seven minutes at most, despite being nine months into its war with Russia. You may notice the hyperlink directs to a page on the Kyiv Metro’s official website, which is obviously in Ukrainian. 
I cannot read, write or speak Ukrainian in any sense. So while the subject piqued my interest, I knew that to find the 10 to 12 other sources in Ukrainian that I would need to write a full-fledged article would be a suicide mission. What’s worse is that no Ukrainian outlet would even report on this, since Ukrainians are perfectly accustomed to having a functional, efficient metro system. The only reason I’d even found out about the metro was thanks to a Hayden Clarkin from New York, who on Sept. 20 tweeted, “I want to stress that Kyiv’s off peak frequency while being invaded is better than nearly all of America’s transit systems during peak. I’m genuinely at a loss of words [sic].”
So my final answer: Reputability is subjective, and is something I hope to outsource in the future to people who can speak on the subject.
Final thoughts
The world seems to shrink smaller and smaller by the day, as we globalize and our bubbles mix and crash and pop like we’ve never seen before. But if there’s one thing you take from this, I hope it’s that the world is also, still, unfathomably large. Every community — be it town, tribe, city, state, nation or continent — has its own problems in addition to our collective ones. Those problems are often a result of the collective — the mistakes and horrors inflicted by other nations and entities on our own.
As we struggle to make a name and a living for ourselves, fresh out of college to wherever we may go, we also bear the responsibility of being a global citizen, and that means rectifying the mistakes of our past, and acknowledging that our every action reverberates in communities around the world. The future of our species depends on it.

It is human nature to bow down to a deity — a greater power, some sort of religious figure that is greater than us all, one to be revered. These figures have massive amounts of influence and model expectations for the people of their country or spirituality to follow. In modern times, particularly in secular countries, this quite often takes place in the form of royalty or celebrity. In England, there is the monarchy, figureheads that provide aspirations of regality and formality. Royal families exist across the European Union, not necessarily in the form of remnants of monolithic power but rather as a concentration of wealth and prosperity. In the United States, there is no monarchy. However, in terms of power and opulence, there is an undisputed royal family, and they are none other than the Kardashians. 
The Kardashians are everywhere, and their influence is completely omnipresent and undeniable. All five of the sisters fall within the top 25 most followed Instagram accounts. Kylie Jenner’s baby announcements broke records of most liked Instagram photos multiple times (albeit for the all-powerful World Record Egg). The premiere of “The Kardashians” was Hulu’s biggest series premiere in history. Yet, their influence and power strays from being purely in the digital sphere. The sisters each get invited to the Met Gala every year. A Kylie billboard, one that has content that changes with the month, sits atop Sunset Boulevard. Every single sister has a brand of content or product of some sort, and one of the most prevalent companies is Kim’s clothing brand, Skims. 
Skims was launched in 2019 with its emphasis lying in shapewear. The brand rose in popularity, and thus the variety of their clothing rose to match. The brand, with sizes that go up to 5X and bylines often reading “fits everybody,” heralds inclusivity as a marker of their brand. Most importantly, as the Kardashian frame became the ubiquitous body shape for girls and women everywhere to aspire to, Skims made that feasible — somewhat.  
I placed my first Skims order a few weeks ago. Any and everyone I knew who had ordered products from the website swore by Kim’s clothing products that were said to be designed to make you look and feel good, even in loungewear. I ordered a few of her products, one of which was a gray cotton tank top, which, as listed in its description, has an “Added bonus: it hits right at the natural waist for a no-fuss, no-tuck fit.” And indeed it did. I ogled myself in the mirror as what seemed like a simple gray tank top somehow managed to fit me nearly like shapewear, in a way that typically only form-fitting, spanx-like material accentuates my body. The company that seemed too good to be true truly was that fucking good. 
But then I began thinking more — thinking of the implications of purchasing and wanting to purchase such a clothing item. Why is it that when lounging in my house, typically when I only see people I trust, if even anyone at all, I feel a need to be presentable and attractive? Perhaps it’s unfortunately my internalized male gaze. Perhaps it’s remnants of raging body dysmorphia. Perhaps both, but more likely than not, it’s because of figures like the Kardashians and brands like Skims, which as a result create the want and need for perfect performance of beauty and desirability. The perfect performance that is only, of course, actually accessible to such a royal family.  
In the seventh episode of the second season of “The Kardashians,” Khloe quips, “Kim, you tailor your underwear.” Despite what Skims may lead one to believe and want the consumer to feel, it simply propagates a false narrative of what is to be expected of physical appearance. They advertise sleek, effortless beauty, when in reality, every aspect of the Kardashians’ outward appearance has been meticulously curated and calculated. Even in the house, one must have their undesirable features tucked in and form-fitted to perfection for reality TV cameras and Instagram stories. We are set to believe that what we see on screen is the truth, but in reality, their appearances could not be further from effortless. 
Clothing should make one feel good, comfortable in one’s skin. That Skims tank top certainly does make me feel sleek and comfortable. Yet, I wish this desire weren’t so strong and weren’t so complimented by the suave gray tank top designed by Kimberly to make me love myself, particularly when in a shapewear-esque top. Of course, the Kardashians are not free from the punishment of the male gaze and unrealistic body standards. However, it’s difficult to sympathize with women who perpetuate such standards, ones who openly talk about losing 16 pounds to fit in a dress, who publicly fat shame and who do little to address the negative impact of their sphere of influence.

In an installment of Tuesday’s Tea, a speaker series that educates students professionally, alumnus Nate Delgado spoke to USC Village residents about “Forget Algebra,” a resource he designed to expose and prepare students for the professional world. A Fall 2019 graduate who works in cybersecurity for Deloitte, Delgado advised attendees, ranging from freshmen to seniors, on how to elevate their resume game to enhance their careers. 
During his time at USC, Delgado majored in economics with a minor in applied computer security. Three years ago, Delgado said he discovered that broad interests such as these had accidentally characterized him as a professional and financial advisor among his friends and family.
“I wanted to share my passion for professional development and personal finance with the next generation,” he said.
Enter Forget Algebra, a website and program that aims to increase the confidence and competence of young adults entering the working world across the country.
“This kind of resource doesn’t exist in traditional education,” he said. “You can go your whole life — and that could be middle school, high school, college — and no one’s ever gonna sit you down and say, ‘Here’s how to make an effective resume.’”
Just a few years older than the majority of students he works with, Delgado cites the difference between Forget Algebra and other resume services in the delivery, not the details.
“What I’m bringing is the energy and the enthusiasm and making it real for the students I’m talking to,” he said.
Before the event, Delgado surveyed attendees on how confident they felt with their resumes and ability to seek advice on professional development, with 76% and 73%, respectively, saying that they didn’t feel confident. 
To Delgado, distinguishing a resume is a three-step process: One, identifying an area of struggle; two, developing a plan for improvement and three, executing the plan to diminish the burden of that weakness on one’s personal and professional life. 
“It shows anyone that you’re talking to that you are self-aware, a self-starter, and that you are welcoming growth and are able to grow, evolve and become a stronger candidate for the position, or as an employee in general,” he said.
Alex LaRosa, a freshman majoring in economics, attended the event and said Delgado’s ability to engage students throughout was a benefit.
“I left with a much more solid concept of what a resume should look like,” LaRosa said. “A lot of what I had walked in with, I now realize probably wouldn’t have gotten me the job opportunities I now have the ability to get.”
For LaRosa, while the content was helpful, he felt Delgado’s delivery had the most impact.
“The way he approached resumes from many different angles made me walk out with a much greater sense of not only how to make a resume, but how to make a splash in the business world,” he said.
Riya Gupta, a freshman majoring in business of cinematic arts, also said Delgado had an engaging strategy. Specifically referring to the “resume roast,” in which Delgado would review a student-submitted resume and offer constructive feedback in a comedic setting, Gupta said the interactive style left her wanting more. 
“It was interesting to see, because anyone could give facts about what makes a good resume, but having an example in real-time and giving feedback on that is especially helpful,” she said.
Looking forward, Gupta said she would attend similar workshops.
“You can always find a way to improve your resume,” she said. “Even for me, as someone who has had a resume for a couple of years, I learned some tips on how to improve it and put things into a better perspective.”
With plans in the works to bring Forget Algebra back to campus in the spring, Delgado is excited to expand Forget Algebra as a cross-country endeavor of people helping people.
“Ultimately, what Forget Algebra can really be effective in is using the in-person conversations as a starting point, and then looping students and young adults into the fold to forge some sort of Forget Algebra community,” he said. 
After all, Delgado said, Forget Algebra is designed as a starting base or a catalyst for professional adventure. 
“It’s so much more than just a website, a set of tools, or articles or blog posts,” he said. “It’s going into classrooms, on campuses or into people’s real lives and sharing these ideas in a way that is engaging, genuine, realistic, concrete and actionable: helping people realize that this stuff doesn’t have to be that complicated.”

The Chai Guys, a student-run podcast, have been producing the newest season of their show against the backdrop of an Iran currently enveloped by exploding civil protest and increasing unease over its fundamentalist regime. Amid this unrest, word of what is going on at home is creating far-reaching implications for the 700,000 Iranians living in Southern California.
“Tehrangeles”, a neighborhood in Westwood, houses much of Los Angeles’ Iranian American community and the biggest community of Iranians outside of the homeland. Among them, a young demographic of Persians is only just growing up to the realities of the ongoings in the Middle East, but is seemingly no less vocal about it compared to their elders. Late last month, over 5,000 protesters filled the area near L.A. City Hall in protest of the deaths of Mahsa Amini and approximately 250 others in subsequent demonstrations in Iran. Many of those protesters were university students.
Darian Ahmadizadeh, a sophomore majoring in data science, recognized this population of Gen-Z Iranian Americans as an engaged one, willing to hear more about the topics that drove discourse in the community, as well as others that their parents or grandparents might consider too risqué for conversation. It’s for this reason, but also for fun, that Ahmadizadeh said he approached fellow USC student and longtime friend Jackson van Horn, a sophomore majoring in film production, to produce a podcast with him. Thus, “Chai Guys” was born. 
The Chai Guys’ first season was released last June, with Ahmadizadeh as co-host and van Horn taking up the role of executive producer. From the first episode, the Chai Guys brands itself as a discussion of “taboo subjects that you’re not necessarily comfortable speaking to your parents about.”
The scope of the Chai Guys was not meant to be particularly expansive at first, Ahmadizadeh and van Horn said. In trying to convince van Horn to join the project, Ahmadizadeh told him to just do it for their friends -— that it would be “funny.”
“We didn’t think anything too serious of it. We reached out to a host, and then I have a couple of connections in the Iranian community so we reached out to a couple of future guests that we had for season one,” Ahmadizadeh said. “We kind of just did it. I think the hardest part was just starting.”
van Horn said he initially had “no idea” how to run a podcast. He found adapting from filmmaking to podcast production through audio mixing and other production techniques was his “biggest challenge” at the time.
“The easiest solution we found was obviously going to a studio where there’s a mixer there… and they mix it as we go so we don’t have to worry about it as much. After that point, everything is just like filmmaking,” van Horn said.
Nonetheless, the response to season one “exceeded expectations,” according to Ahmadizadeh. The Chai Guys introduced a plethora of guest speakers, from comedians to TikTok influencers, across seven episodes. The trailer, Ahmadizadeh said, resulted in “press reach[ing] out to us from all over the country, even back home in Iran.” They aim to build on this interest.
The Chai Guys hope that their guest list, new studio and revamped hosting team will earn the second season more success when it is released in December across platforms such as YouTube, Apple Podcasts and Spotify, with clips also to be uploaded to TikTok to generate further interest. They host a variety of guests, such as Nina and Nicolette Gray — a mother and daughter duo featured on “Dr. Phil” in August 2018 that garnered mainstream media attention — as well as Pej Vahdat, an actor who starred in the TV series “Dynasty,” and Ashley Zarah, an up-and-coming musician.
“I was really happy and really proud to see the younger generation kind of taking the reins of what our culture is going to look like in the future,” said Zarah on being a guest on the show. 
“I think what they’re doing is reminding people of the value of that inherent culture … something you can’t get rid of, but it’s something that controls your day to day,” Zarah said.  “So they’re really connecting everybody in a comedic way, in an artistic way. I saw a lot of the guests that they had there. They’re coming from all sorts of different backgrounds and really challenging the meaning of what it means to be an Iranian in America.”
In addition to these changes, the Chai Guys have altered the tone of some of their conversations in response to the recent events in Iran. It created a conundrum for the creators of the podcast of whether or not to continue. 
“We eventually decided to do it, and I’m really grateful for having a platform and having the freedom of speech to do it in L.A., because we couldn’t have done this in Iran, talking freely about these heavy subtopics,” Ahmadizadeh said.
Van Horn said that there is a focus on the current Iranian protests in all their conversations with guests.
“[The recent events in Iran are] the center focus of this second season, every single episode. Every single guest touched on it, how it’s impacted them and how within their own industry,” van Horn said. “They believe people can help.”

One year ago today, USC was on the precipice of its worst loss to UCLA, a 62-33 thrashing that sent the 2021 season to a new low. 
Now? A win Saturday puts the Trojans in their first Pac-12 championship game in a full season since 2017. 
Naturally, there would be a feeling of thankfulness for how much the program has changed in a year. But, it’s been a mixed bag as USC has struggled to put all sides of the ball together in a game.
Whenever the offense is rolling, the defense stumbles. Whenever the defense is dominating, the offense is obsolete. And the special teams have been hit or miss — either cold or as hot as the Torch above the Peristyle.
Head Coach Lincoln Riley is aware of this. He even acknowledged last week that those three sides just haven’t come together yet this season. The Trojans have still been able to win nine games, so watch out when they put it together.  
But, jeez, last year? Practically none of the sides were good enough ever. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum became the stomping ground for opposing teams. This year, not so much, with no road team winning a game at the Coliseum.
Simply put — are we taking this USC team for granted?
A team that’s lived in the AP Top-25 Poll, had its best start to a season since 2006 and recaptured a fan base that became increasingly disassociated with the program. Once mired by scandals and laughable play, the Trojans have been all about one thing — winning. 
Now, again I ask, are we taking the team for granted? Riley thinks so. 
“We put ourselves in a great position,” he said last week. “And I gotta be honest I think that’s getting lost a little bit around here. Don’t forget where this thing was last year and I think a lot of people have… let’s make sure we have some perspective around here.” 
With that perspective, it can bring complacency, something redshirt senior running back Travis Dye pointed out in October could be a problem for the team. USC fell into some form of complacency, playing consecutive incomplete games against struggling Arizona and Cal.
Speaking of Dye, however, it’s been four days since he injured his leg, putting him out for the rest of the season. Dye’s injury is a blow for many reasons. 
He was USC’s emotional leader, its best running back and a player with Pac-12 Championship-winning experience. Dye has the triple crown: talent, experience and competitive fire. 
Dye had a crucial impact on the culture shift of the USC program, something that was in dire need of change after last season. I’ve written about it in this space before, but in 12 months, it is truly night and day how much this program has transformed.
Whereas last year, meaningful games ended after October with bowl game hopes diminished, this year, the Trojans’ season is arguably just beginning.
The Bruins in Pasadena is the biggest matchup between the two rivals in years. Notre Dame returning to the Coliseum the week after to end the regular season is a perfect game to prepare USC for the postseason. And of course, the Pac-12 Championship Game and likely a New Years’ Six Bowl will follow.
Remember when the Trojans ended last season with a practically meaningless game against Cal on the day of conference championship games? Not this year. 
As Riley said, this program is in not just a great position, but in my eyes, a perfect one. It’s all in USC’s hands, a formula as simple as being “1-0” on the week. It’s the Trojans’ best chance at controlling its destiny, moving past the failures of the last five years and creating a new era of USC football.
Just remember where this all was a year ago — in the dumps.

The Trojans’ season ended with an upset on their home turf, losing to UC Irvine 2-0 in a gritty first round playoff match. 
The Anteaters went up 1-0 early in the first half, capitalizing on a loose ball from a long throw-in, then iced the match in the final minutes when USC pushed players forward to chase a goal.
USC entered the NCAA tournament as a 4-seed, while UCI was unseeded and qualified automatically as Big West Conference champions. The Anteaters found strong form towards the end of their season, conceding zero goals over three conference tournament matches. 
Much like they did in their Big West tournament final, UCI relied on attacking set pieces and physical defending to earn a win over the Trojans. 
USC showed promise in the opening few minutes, pressing intensely and moving the ball up the field with relative ease. After about eight minutes, UCI settled into the game and began to turn the tide against the Trojans. UCI consolidated possession and pushed up the right flank. When the ball did go to Irvine’s left, they used their prowess with the long throw to advance the ball quickly and peg the Trojans back. 
Eventually, USC collapsed under the pressure of UCI cannon of a long throw. The ball landed in a dangerous area in front of graduate goalkeeper Anna Smith, which USC failed to clear, and Irvine midfielder Destinee Manzo looped the ball to the back post from close range. Smith stumbled back to try and clear the ball off the line, but the ball trickled in.
USC upped the intensity in response, but found it difficult to create chances that resulted in many shots on goal. 
USC found some success down the left side with the interplay of sophomore forward Simone Jackson, junior midfielder Zoe Burns and graduate defender Brandi Peterson, who played at left back. Jackson threatened the UCI defense with her pace and tricky dribbling, allowing Peterson space behind her to cut inside and shoot with her right foot. Unfortunately for USC, Irvine limited Peterson’s two shots on goal to distance efforts from unlikely angles. 
With Irvine fending off the pressure, junior forward Angeles Escobar was subbed onto the field at left wing, allowing Jackson to move to the right. Despite the personnel change, USC didn’t find better shots, and the first half ended 1-0. 
Once the second half started, it became clear that Irvine wanted to shut the game down, sitting deep and defending tight to frustrate USC. Head Coach Jane Alukonis made some tactical shifts to help USC get and stay forward, pushing sophomore defender Brooklyn Courtnall, who typically plays centerback, into the midfield. Sophomore midfielder Aaliyah Farmer became the lone striker. Again, USC turned up the intensity, sending balls forward relentlessly and trying to use Farmer’s height or Jackson’s speed to unnerve Irvine’s defense. Yet, the Anteaters showed no obvious hole to exploit. 
In the 59th minute, Jackson received a pass in transition on the left flank and went on a slaloming run into Irvine’s box, but her shot was tame and Irvine’s keeper collected the ball. Senior defender Nicole Payne made a similar run from the right side about five minutes later, but her shot was saved low to the right.
With USC’s players pushing forward to chase a goal, the Anteaters flicked a ball forward into forward Alyssa Moore, who noticed that USC redshirt senior defender Kaylin Martin had stumbled and drove towards Smith’s goal. Martin, Peterson and Smith all rushed towards Moore to quell the threat, but Moore danced between them and passed the ball into the net with Smith well off her line. Irvine went up 2-0 in the 87th minute, ringing the Trojans’ death knell. 
The match ended with Irvine adding another giant killing to their gallery after beating UCLA in the first round of last year’s tournament when the Bruins were a 2-seed. 
After the match, Alukonis lamented USC’s slow start. 
“I thought we had a tough start,” Alukonis said. 
Pre-match, Alukonis had anticipated that Irvine would use their long throw to put USC on the back foot, saying it “was something we knew that they did and knew that they’ve had success with.”
“Just untidy at a moment, and I think that set us off… unfortunate result, but well played by Irvine and we wish them luck,” she said. 
As to the change that pushed Courtnall into midfield, Alukonis said they were “just trying to get more players who could be dangerous higher up on the field. She did well, it was just unfortunate [that] nothing came our way.”
Reflecting on the season as a whole, Alukonis acknowledged that the team dropped too many results against opponents they were excited to beat. 
“We strive for more consistency. It’s great to beat top teams, but to be repeatedly good, repeatedly successful and to be national champions [or] Pac-12 champions, you can’t let games slip away where we should, if we execute, be the better team,” she said. 
UC Irvine will play their second round match against Brown Friday. USC will regroup and begin anew next season.
