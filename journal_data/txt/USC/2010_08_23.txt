Summer is officially over for USC students and classes are underway, but the schedule remains the same for the football team, which has been practicing for almost three weeks in preparation for its season opener at Hawaii on Sept. 2.
Despite several injuries to key offensive players, coach Lane Kiffin was pleased with how the offense performed on the first day of the semester.

“Kyle Prater did more than he had to do and Butch Lewis stepped up for us [Monday],” Kiffin said. “Practice was a little strange because of class conflicts, but I thought our guys were tuned in and understood they have to turn it up another notch.”
The depth of the Trojans doesn’t hurt the team either. Kiffin and the coaching staff still have yet to determine who will be starting for the season opener.
“We have made some moves towards that with the way our reps are going in practice but we haven’t finalized anything yet,” Kiffin said.

Senior tailback Allen Bradford bruised his left knee during Friday’s practice and didn’t scrimmage Saturday, but was in full pads for practice Monday, ready to help contribute in any way possible.
“My knee feels better and I was out there running around,” Bradford said. “There’s a little soreness, but I’m just trying to play on it. I just got to get healthy, that’s the most important part. I got to take care of my body first and not worry about playing time.”
Senior offensive guard Butch Lewis also returned to practice after dealing with a groin injury last week, but despite key players missing time, Bradford is still optimistic the offense will be more than ready for the season opener.
“Our offense is really focused and everybody is anxious to play,” Bradford said. “Butch and I are important keys to the offense, but we got guys backing us up that are as good as us and can get the job done. We just got to go out there and work hard and we’ll be fine.”

Lane Kiffin stood there with his arms crossed, surrounded by the typical frenzy of reporters, his face serious, his answers succinct.
It was early August. The first official practice of training camp had just been completed. The new USC coach spoke in a business-like tone to a handful of reporters. A smile didn’t dare threaten to break across his face. His body language was a bit defensive and he never let his guard down.
This was my first eyewitness look at the new USC coach, my first impression of the post-Pete Carroll era from the head man himself. I had no idea what to expect from Kiffin, but I left thinking only one thing­ — for a guy who coached under Carroll for six years, Kiffin could not be more different.
At Pac-10 media day, Kiffin kept his sunglasses on at the podium, a move that some saw as arrogant and disrespectful. He speaks and looks like a guy with something to prove. He probably doesn’t want to be compared to Carroll, especially at this early and uncertain stage, but the comparison is unavoidable. You are always judged against your predecessor.
He knows that to have any chance of winning the hearts of USC fans, he has to win games.
“Winning and losing games are the things that matter,” Kiffin said after the first day of training camp.
Kiffin has a tendency to ruffle feathers (see the entire state of Tennessee) though some of that will be forgiven if he can win. But in light of the iron hammer the NCAA dropped on USC this offseason, this is a rare case where winning won’t be enough.
Kiffin has to win, but do it in a different way. What was acceptable in the past will no longer fly. Kiffin has to reinvent the culture at USC with a quality that was easily Carroll’s largest shortcoming: discipline.
Throughout the Carroll era, USC was always near the top of the list in the Pac-10 in penalty yards per game. In 2008, the Trojans drew 103 yellow flags for 948 yards. They improved only a bit last season, drawing 90 penalties for 798 yards.
Discipline off the field must improve as well. Kiffin has already had a chance to prove himself in this category. He suspended freshman tailback Dillon Baxter for the season opener at Hawaii next week for an undisclosed violation of team rules. An unnamed source told the Los Angeles Times that marijuana use was involved.
Then again, Kiffin allowed senior fullback Stanley Havili to return to practice only a day after it was revealed that he punched junior cornerback T.J. Bryant, an injury that forced Bryant to have surgery on his cheekbone.
All of these decisions will be inevitably second-guessed, but there is little doubt that the feel of the program has changed.
“It’s a total turnaround from the old program to coach Kiffin’s style,” senior center Kristofer O’Dowd said. “It started in February and it carried all the way over here to August.”
Fair or unfair, Kiffin’s decisions will be judged against the standards that Carroll set, especially in this upcoming season.
Although it is certain that Carroll’s reputation took a huge hit in Los Angeles when he took the job at the Seattle Seahawks, USC fans are going to find it hard to forget the eight consecutive winning seasons, the seven-straight Pac-10 titles and the two national championships.
Even more importantly, perhaps, is the cult of personality that Carroll fostered so well during his tenure at USC. He had a childlike enthusiasm for the game. He seemed to bounce around the practice field and from one subject to another in interviews. He had the perfect amount of rah-rah, fire-’em-up energy that so well suited the college game and the Trojans.
Enter Kiffin.
Kiffin’s personality simply cannot compare to Carroll’s. He’s not going to flash any boyish grins. He’s rarely going to joke around. He’s serious. He’s all business.
If you think about the position Kiffin is in, his standoffishness makes sense.
Kiffin acts like he has something to prove because he does. He went 5-15 at the helm of the Oakland Raiders and 7-6 as the head coach at the University of Tennessee. The message boards are full of detractors who say he hasn’t paid the necessary dues to warrant the head coaching job at USC.
Kiffin has a chance to silence the critics. The first step is obviously to win games.
But to truly win over USC fans, he has to do things differently than Carroll, and the most logical place to start is discipline.
Perhaps it’s no surprise that Kiffin is playing things so close to the chest, keeping his arms crossed and his sunglasses on. The glare from stepping out of Pete Carroll’s shadow is going to be a heck of a challenge to overcome.

If Friday afternoon was a test in first impressions, then the No. 19 USC women’s soccer team failed its exam.
With Pat Haden watching his first USC athletic contest as the school’s new athletic director, the Women of Troy (0-1) could not muster a strong showing, falling to the visiting University of San Diego (1-0) 1-0 in the team’s home opener at McAllister Field.

“We didn’t respond well,” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin. “We made a lot of mistakes over the simple things. We missed a lot of easy passes. We made the game more difficult than it needed to be.”
Many of those mistakes can be attributed to a lack of experience, as five freshmen started the home opener, including goalkeeper Shelby Church, who is replacing the departing All-American Kristin Olsen in the net.
But even more damaging to USC’s efforts to secure a season-opening win was its lackluster start.
In the early minutes, the Toreros controlled the ball and maintained possession, keeping the ball away from the Women of Troy’s young offensive playmakers. Even when USC did regain possession, it was largely an errant pass or some other miscue that gave the ball right back to the San Diego offense.
“We missed a lot of easy passes,” Khosroshahin said. “That’s the bottom line. If you miss those opportunities to connect with your teammates, it makes the game really difficult.”
San Diego didn’t fare much better, however, as it was unable to initially capitalize off early USC turnovers. On several occasions, the Toreros watched a crisp pass bounce off the foot of a player or sail past the goal.
In short, sloppy play on both sides kept the game scoreless at halftime.
“When you don’t connect your passes, you have to work twice as hard,” Khosroshahin said.
But eventually, one side would make the needed adjustments and regain its composure. Unfortunately for Haden and those USC fans in attendance, that team was San Diego.
In the 54th minute, following a turnover by freshman midfielder Elizabeth Eddy, San Diego’s forward Stephanie Ochs penetrated deep into USC territory and sent a cross from the left side of the field. San Diego forward Devany Savage knocked the ball past Church with a diving header that put the Toreros on the scoreboard and firmly in the driver’s seat.
“It caught the defense a little off guard, but you have to give them credit, it was a good header,” Church said. She conceded just one goal on the afternoon.
Tallying two saves and allowing just one goal, the freshman goalkeeper mostly kept the San Diego offense at bay, but in the end, it was USC’s inability to capitalize offensively that prevented it from earning the victory.
Later in the half, USC had multiple scoring opportunities, but oftentimes, a turnover or a widely missed shot prevented them from converting.
In the 66th minute, junior midfielder Carly Butcher passed the ball up the field to Eddy, but the freshman watched the ball sail to the right of the goal. Later in the match, freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano crossed the ball into the box, where senior midfielder Alyssa Dávila got a head on the ball, only to watch San Diego goalkeeper Courtney Parsons make another save.
“I think a lot of us went individually, so in the future, we need to do better at staying connected as a unit,” Dávila said. “We’ll need more communication, and when we’re attacking, we also need to be more alert.”
Nobody cited a lack of confidence moving forward, but nonetheless, the loss remains relatively painful for Khosroshahin’s roster.
“We’ll get better, but this one stings a little bit,” Khosroshahin said.
Luckily, the Women of Troy will be afforded that chance later this week, when they travel to Fort Worth, Texas, to face Texas Christian University. But for now, all that remains is time to reflect.

Much of the well-deserved hype about the Ronald Tutor Campus Center revolves around how the university has finally fulfilled its pledge to enhance residential student life by creating a central meeting space and an array of restaurants on campus.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
As a commuter, I’m just glad that I’ll finally have a comfy place to study or relax during those long periods of time between classes.
The stigma of the commuter school label leaves many students with the impression that there’s little to do on campus. The main hurdle USC faces in becoming a more residential campus will be offering enough conveniences to compete with the comforts of going home for the weekend or the excitement of a night on the town.
Other than the University Village, Exposition Park and the few restaurants on Figueroa, very little is within walking distance for students looking for an easy distraction. While Southern California abounds with attractions for seemingly every student — Disneyland, West Hollywood, etc. — the dismal state of public transportation and trafﬁc makes off-campus travel rather unbearable at times.
Although USC has a strong Greek culture with a bustling social calendar and an ongoing series of events from programs such as Visions and Voices, the university lacks in more general entertainment venues, such as the bowling alleys or movie theaters that  students of UC San Diego enjoys(though the School of Cinematic Arts does offer regular screenings and premieres).
As a university in the middle of Los Angeles, USC enjoys the big-name celebrities who visit for special lectures or premieres, and the university’s close proximity to L.A. Live allows students the convenience of free shuttles Downtown. USC already does an excellent job of exploiting the city’s resources to the fullest.
The university should focus slower, simpler pleasures in order to further break away from the commuter school tradition.
In the last few years, the abbreviated hours at The Lot and the limited space at Traditions have left the campus vacant after 6 p.m., even during the school week. Shuttles to L.A. Live have been helpful but have done little in terms of enduring a whole weekend on campus. Going to the same — often expensive — places becomes monotonous, regardless of free transportation.
The campus center is a strong step in the right direction, offering laid-back leisure like casual sit-down restaurants and an arcade that should incentivize students to stay on campus after the school day is done. The campus center will offer better meeting spaces to accommodate student organizations, study sessions, groups of friends or anybody just looking for a place to kill some time. But the transition from commuter to residential school will not end with the campus center, though it does bring the goal into a much closer grasp. The manner in which students utilize the center in the next few months will be crucial in assessing how much more needs to be done to make the campus feel more like a home to its residents.
Future endeavors must first consider the university’s location within Los Angeles, especially when it comes to housing. Efforts such as the new University Gateway apartments help improve student residential housing life by offering luxury entertainment, including a fully equipped fitness center and a Wii gaming room, that encourages students to hang around after hours. But with an astronomical price tag, Gateway only echoes the same budget versus entertainment debate that students face when they venture to L.A. Live, leaving this housing option closed to many students. Residents not only need the convenience and variety of places like Gateway but also economic options in order to be convinced to stay the weekend.
Students want a mix of venues that are cheap, creative and easy to access. Students and administrators looking to cement USC’s status as a residential school must keep in mind the competition of nearby, more accessible attractions, as well as the need to revamp the remaining areas of campus bereft of casual leisure. The Ronald Tutor Campus Center, the University Gateway apartments and the renovation of the University Village all offer new reasons for students to consider campus home, but the coup de gráce for becoming a resident university lies in capitalizing on those places that exude a casual, come-and-go-as-you-please feel. When USC finally does earn its stripes as a residential school, the entire university community — both residents and commuters — will enjoy the benefits.

As students return to campus, they once again begin the challenge of juggling classes, a new schedule and a healthy social life. Walking this academic tightrope might take a toll on one’s health and, as the semester rolls on and stress levels rise, develop into an occasional visit to the university park health center.
William Brown | Daily Trojan
Instead of serving as a reliable beacon of support and care, however, the University Park Health Center has earned a somewhat lackluster reputation among the university community. According to CollegeProwler.com, approximately 66 percent of surveyed USC students rated the health center as being of “mediocre” quality. Only 17 percent of students rated it high. Taking these concerns into consideration, the health center’s success depends on students voicing their opinions in order to improve the patient experience.
In fact, improving the patient experience involves, or actually requires, student input. With plans for a new health center to be built, along with a multitude of exciting changes throughout the university, this is the prime time to get involved in the future of USC’s health services.
“Generally, the feedback we get [about the health center] is not spectacular,” said Maya Babla, a senior majoring in communication and public diplomacy who co-founded Emergency Medical Services of USC. “Students complain of long wait times, the fact that you have to make an appointment and go in to get a referral for a specialist, and the hours.”
Also worrisome to students is the issue of confidentiality, mostly given the center’s limited lobby space and lack of privacy.
The center is open during a small four-hour window for urgent care on weekends during the academic year. For a university where the majority of students remain on-campus during the weekends, it seems strange to reduce medical services on these days. Weekdays, the center closes at 5 or 7 p.m., depending on the day, after which students need to contact an advice nurse or the Department of Public Safety. The health center is also closed entirely on weekends during the summer semester, a time during which a number of students live and study at USC.
However, Dr. Larry Neinstein, executive director of the health center, said that the hours are sufficient for students.
“We are one of the only health centers in the country that is open seven days a week, which is very appropriate for the kind of campus we have.”
That fact, in addition to the after-hours accommodation, Neinstein said, is unique for university health services. Having a 24-hour health center would not only be impractical, he said, it would drive up costs, such as the current $234 health center fee students pay each semester.
It’s important to note that the health center has been taking strides to improve patient satisfaction. Neinstein said the center’s website, which was last redesigned about five years ago, is due for a major overhaul in the coming year. Neinstein highly encourages students to get involved in the planning process, from changing the look and feel of the website to adding new content,
For the last year and a half, the health center has also provided the “My Student Health Record”  function on the center’s website, an online portal that allows students to schedule appointments and correspond with a regular clinician, complete forms prior to an appointment, and view their immunization records entirely online. This streamlines the paperwork and provides access to important information without having to visit the center. The health center’s website has additional resources to help students apply self-care for minor illness or injury. It includes a mental health support system and a vast educational reference database on health topics, among other resources.
Even with these features, USC can do more to improve the student-patient experience. Still, the students have to take advantage of the outlets available to them.
“One thing I’d love to see is greater feedback mechanisms in place at the health center,” Babla said. “If students have complaints after a poor visit, it’d be great if there were a system in place for them to voice their concerns.”
Currently, patients can contact the center with general comments via an online contact form or feedback forms at the center. The administration also conducts monthly analyses of the center’s specific departments to test for student-patient satisfaction. In addition, the USC Student Health Advisory Council, which is a part of the health center, facilitates feedback from the student community by holding open meetings every month.
Neinstein strongly encourages students to use the center’s online resources and provide feedback from both positive and negative visits, and said the new health center, which is “a wish and a priority of the new president, Max Nikias,” would be built behind the Lyon Center. The first phase is complete and now requires the approval of the Board of Trustees. It would not open its doors for two and a half years.
Expressing student opinion is crucial to the current center’s efficacy. With the health center making tangible improvements to its services, the benefit to students can be maximized if we do our share of pitching in. Although the center already provides a number of services and support mechanisms, there is ample room for improvement, much of which begins with sharing our concerns directly with the health center.

Department of Public Safety officers flooded campus today to ensure students followed all biking rules, despite DPS saying it would not be making any changes to USC’s bike safety provisions for the start of this year.
Between the hours of 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., there is a bike ban around the central parts of campus, such as on Trousdale Parkway between the Von KleinSmid Center and the Student Union. At the borders of these locations, DPS officers stood — both on foot and on segway — and demanded that all students walk their bikes, skateboards, scooters or motorized vehicles.
Although some students might have found the bike ban — which is not a new regulation on campus — disrupting to their rides to class, compared to the threat of a bike-free campus, which is one idea proposed by USC’s traffic safety task force to solve the increasingly chaotic bike traffic around campus, walking a bike might not sound that bad.

The band that sang so much about its neighborhood on its 2004 debut album, Funeral, will be performing in our neighborhood in just a few weeks. On Oct. 7 and 8, Win, Will, Régine and the rest of the Montreal-based rock band, Arcade Fire, will grace local fans with their presence at the Shrine Auditorium. The Los Angeles shows are the group’s last two of the year in the United States before it begins its international tour.
Arcade Fire has recently been enjoying a massively successful month of August. The band’s third studio album, The Suburbs, released on Aug. 3, opened to absurdly impressive critical and commercial acclaim and it quickly sailed to the tops of United States, United Kingdom, Irish and Canadian record sales in its opening week. Two days after its release, the legendary filmmaker Terry Gilliam, behind such classics as Monty Python and the Holy Grail and lead singer Win Butler’s favorite film, Brazil, directed the concert movie of the band’s Aug. 5 Madison Square Garden performance which was simultaneously broadcasted live on YouTube for fans around the world to watch in the comfort of their homes for free.
Tickets for the two Shrine shows went on sale this past Thursday and are available to purchase through the band’s website or at Ticketmaster. Gilliam’s energetic first foray into concert filmmaking is still available online for free.

And then there were 65.
No, that’s not the number of teams in the old NCAA tournament basketball field — that number will be 68 this season, by the way. It’s the number of scholarship players available to play on the USC football team’s roster.
The number dropped from 67 to 65 on Friday when freshmen Demetrius Wright and Jesse Scroggins were declared ineligible by the NCAA. Wright, a cornerback, and Scroggins, a quarterback, both hadn’t passed NCAA clearinghouse when their 14-day grace periods expired. Wright and Scroggins practiced with the team for the past two weeks while their paperwork was under review, but were sent home on Friday by coach Lane Kiffin until they were deemed eligible to play.
Kiffin said he is still hopeful that the matter “will be resolved very quickly and we will be able to get them back,” in a media appearance after Friday’s practice. This leaves the Trojans 20 players short of the maximum number of scholarship players allowed on a roster, however. This is because of injuries, players leaving early for the NFL, players transferring because of the sanctions and ineligibility.
Kiffin said he is concerned that this number still might dwindle.
“We’re not talking about guys who are redshirting and aren’t even available to play,” Kiffin told ESPN.com. “We’re redshirting another 10 guys or so. There’s 57. All of a sudden, you get those three or four season-ending injuries, unfortunately, you’re at 53. Well, there’s your NFL roster: 53.”

I feel so sorry for the poor cheating USC slobs.
CHEAT ON!!!

Though classes begin today, USC athletics has already been busy preparing for its upcoming seasons.
The No. 19 women’s soccer team kicked things off on Friday with its first game of the season at McAlister Field. USC started five freshman, including goalkeeper Shelby Church who takes over for departed standout Kristin Olsen. Church made some clutch saves and only conceded one goal in her debut. Unfortunately, the Women of Troy’s offense was unable to find the back of the net and USC took a 1-0 loss to University of San Diego.
The football team was also preparing for its upcoming season with the annual preseason scrimmage on Saturday. The 111-play scrimmage pitted the offense against the defense, with the offense scoring six touchdowns  only to have the defense counter with four interceptions. Quarterback Mitch Mustain was picked off twice and Matt Barkley once, but Barkley’s interception was returned 35 yards for a touchdown by cornerback Shareece Wright.
Last but not least, 2008 Olympic silver medalist Rebecca Soni won the 100m breaststroke at the Pan Pacific Championships, which started on Wednesday. Her time of 1:04.93 is the third-fastest time ever in the event.

For those faint of heart, watching Saw probably consists only of peaking through fingers and hearing blood-curdling screams come through the speakers.
But for the passionate group of horror-philic moviegoers who crave such features, Saw is a thrill ride. Again and again, fans have filled theaters across the nation and boosted movie ticket sales in a frenzy for a film that became notorious for mixing psychological suspense and unbridled gore. Its popularity quickly exploded, creating a phenomenon that gave birth to sequel upon sequel.
Drawing a large amount of attention from moviegoers also garnered the flick the Guinness World Record for being the “Most Successful Horror Movie Series” in 2010. Directed by James Wan and written by Leigh Whannell, the first Saw horror film introduced Jigsaw in 2004, the idea grew through six sequels, all screened around Halloween.
So how could the story possibly grow after so many plot twists and numerous sequels? 3-D of course. Saw 3-D, directed by Kevin Greutert and written by Marcus Dunstan and Patrick Melton, will hit movie screens Oct. 29. The newest creation will reveal whether fans will grow weary of the story or continue to catapult the movie’s success.
FYI Director Kevin Greutert is a USC grad.

Famed rock star Steve Miller will serve as an artist in residence at the USC Thornton School of Music, teaching master classes and seminars for undergraduates on topics such as guitar instruction and the music industry.
Miller, who was the front man and guitarist of the Steve Miller Band, has worked with Thornton before as a guest speaker and guest artist, according to the New York Times.
He had also served as a consultant during the creation of the school’s current popular music performance program, which now enrolls 55 students. He will serve as an expert on pop music during his time at USC.
“Every time he comes into contact with students, he just comes away energized and wants to work with them on more of a sustained basis,” Chris Sampson, associate dean of the Thornton School, said to the Times.
Though he has no set schedule for his appearances at USC, Miller has agreed to stay an extra day in Los Angeles every time he visits the city. This day will be set aside for sessions at Thornton.
Sampson said Miller will be on campus at least twice a semester.
“Clearly, Steve cares deeply about the next generation of musicians and wants to be a part of their growth. His willingness to share his incredible experience with our students will undoubtedly transform their experience,” Sampson told American Songwriter.
Other artists in residence at USC include Grammy Award-winning musician and music director Patrice Rushen and songwriter Lamont Dozier.
Thank you..really informative!!
