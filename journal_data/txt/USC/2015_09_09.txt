USC janitors took to Trousdale Parkway Wednesday in their second protest in less than a week.
Dressed in purple t-shirts and carrying signs that proclaimed “Justice for Janitors,” the large group made a circuit around campus, passing McCarthy Quad, Katherine B. Loker Stadium and Tommy Trojan before ending near the Finger Fountain. They conducted a similar protest last Friday.
The 200-250 janitors organized by the Service Employees International Union, United Service Workers West, are asking USC officials to support them in their bid for higher wages and better health care benefits from subcontractor Aramark. The previously protested on campus  in 2009 and in 2012.
“We have been basically negotiating a contract for the workers where we’re trying to make sure we maintain the standard and elevate in areas where we think it’s the most important, so specifically in wages,” said Edmundo Garcia, contract enforcement specialist at SEIU USWW.
The workers union contract expired at the end of June. Since, the janitors have been working without a contract, according to Luiz Fuentes, lead organizer with SIEU USWW.
“[Negotiations haven’t] gone as smoothly as we would like for it to go,” Fuentes said.
Though the janitors’ negotiations are strictly with Aramark, the group hopes that the University can assist them in negotiating a better contract.
“As the entity getting the services from Aramark, [the University has] a big stake in this,” Garcia said.
Flyers the group has been handing out include the numbers of both President C.L. Max Nikias and John Welsh, associate vice president of Facilities Management Services, and ask supporters to call the two.
USC, however, said it is not involved in the negotiations.
“We know the University is one of the most highly endowed universities,” Garcia said. “We feel like we want to make sure that our janitors are getting paid good wages so that they can continue to provide the benefits and decent living for their families.”
Currently, the janitors earn from $9.75 up to $17 an hour, depending on how long they’ve held their job and their skill set, Garcia said.
“These workers need to stay ahead of the minimum wage, especially on a campus that can afford it,” Luiz said. “They need to protect their healthcare, and we need to protect the conditions of the workers in this campus.”
Previously, USC directly employed the janitors.
“Many of them feel very tied to the USC community,” Garcia said. “They see themselves as USC workers.”
Salvador Hernandez, one of the janitors protesting, said he’s been working at USC for 25 years.
“We’re protesting because it’s one of our rights to raise issues and concerns and also voice our position,” Hernandez said through a translator. “We want the university president to know we want a good contract.”

It was quite a summer for last year’s USC varsity crew captain, senior Taylor Beach. Beach had the honor of being invited to train with members of the U.S. National Rowing team at Craftsbury Outdoor Center in Vermont, a training center that produces some of the United States’ most successful elite rowers.
Beach, who began his rowing career just three years ago as a walk-on at USC, competed in the U.S. Under-23 Rowing Trials in West Windsor, New Jersey in late June and placed third in the lightweight single scull event, just missing out on securing a spot on the U.S. team after winning his two preliminary races. Beach also made the finals of the lightweight single scull event at the U.S. Elite National Championship in Princeton, New Jersey, placing sixth while racing for USC.
At the same event, Beach and his four-man boat placed third while competing as a team in a race where nearly every other participant was a national team athlete or Olympian. In fact, Beach’s boat defeated the USA World University Games crew by three open lengths of water — the rowing equivalent of three touchdowns.
In late July, Beach went on to win the heavyweight double scull event with Cornell senior Ned Benning, which qualified the pair to race as members of the U.S. National Team at the U23 World Championships later in the summer.
There, Beach, along with Benning, placed 16th at the 2015 Under-23 World Rowing Championships in Plovdiv, Bulgaria in the men’s double scull event. While representing their country, Beach’s boat finished fourth in its final race.
“Having made my first national team is the first step on the way to future Olympic selection, but there’s a lot of work left to do,” Beach said.
Third-year USC men’s crew head coach Paul Wilkins, who’s worked with Beach extensively over the course of his rowing career, said that Beach gives his younger rowers something to look up to and aspire to be.
“He is a tribute to how far you can go with how hard you work,” Wilkins said. “His great desire to achieve and win at the highest level has gotten him to where he is today.”
A former member of the recreational club council executive board, Beach’s experience within USC’s club sports department also shows the depth and ability of low-budget programs to produce athletes who can compete at the highest levels of their sports, according to USC Men’s Crew board member Stan Mullin.
With more than 50 clubs, Recreational Sports represents a diverse collection of athletes. Some of these teams aim to compete locally, others regionally, some nationally and — in rare cases — some internationally. While these sports may not operate on large budgets, they’re showing that they can be extremely competitive and successful, and Beach is a prime example of that.
“It was exciting to represent my club team at the highest levels of competition in the world, and I hope it shows students everywhere in the University that walk-on athletes and those who are willing to work hard can achieve any level of success they want,” Beach said.
This year, Beach, who is majoring in business administration and english literature, is spending his time training at the men’s crew rowing center in San Pedro in preparation for the 2016 Under-23 World Championships.
After being founded as a varsity sport in 1948 and then reestablished as a club sport in 2001, the USC Men’s Crew program, which currently boasts over 40 members, traditionally competes nationally against other top collegiate programs.
Beach says that his success at the international level wouldn’t have been possible without the program’s support, and that it’s an honor to represent USC when competing among the world’s best.
“Twelve hundred USC Men’s Crew alumni and supporters have followed Taylor’s racing career, culminating in his success this summer,” Mullin said. “His integrity and leadership with the other oarsmen, coxswains and alumni are what truly make him a role model and spokesperson for the University.”
Beach will look to continue his training in hopes of one day competing at the 2020 and 2024 Summer Olympics and earning a medal for the United States.

Wednesday morning’s football practice was more focused and intense compared to the previous day’s practice despite the over 90 degree temperature before 10 a.m. Head coach Steve Sarkisian said he was happy with the team’s energy and focus throughout practice.
“The heat has been good for us,” Sarkisian said. “It’s a positive that we have to work through it.”
Sarkisian sees practices as a whole as what’s most important for the team. He said when the team plays hard consistently throughout practice, that’s what prepares them for the games.
“We have to be hard on one another because that’s going to make us better and help us perform better on Saturdays,” Sarkisian said.
Sarkisian spoke about how true freshman inside linebacker Osa Masina has been playing much more confidently over the past two to three weeks and is playing to his strengths. Masina grabbed another interception during the team portion of practice Wednesday.
Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox also praised Masina’s performance after practice. Masina delivered an immediate impact for the Trojans in his debut after returning a fumble recovery 46 yards for a touchdown.
Wilcox pointed out that the defense will continue to see a significant amount of substitutions. He’d like to continue to see a lot of balance in the number of snaps his plays see in each game. The team’s fluidity is dependent on themselves, not the opponent.
“It’s about getting fresh bodies in the game,” Wilcox said. “Getting the guys who can help us win the game.”
Though the defense played well and held Arkansas State to only a touchdown, Wilcox would like to the team fortify its coverage against dual threat quarterbacks.
“We had chances to make some negative plays that we did not make,” Wilcox said. “Those things need to improve.”
On offense, Sarkisian said he was was glad that the young offensive line was challenged against Arkansas State. He said that being challenged on the first series of the first game will be beneficial for the team later on in the season.
“In the grand scheme of things, we’re still a little young,” Sarkisian said. “But I still think we are going to be very good.”
Redshirt sophomore safety Chris Hawkins, who had an interception and a fumble recovery last game, thought that the defense’s performance as a unit was a good one with so many different players seeing playing time against Arkansas State.
“It’s valuable to mix guys up,” Hawkins said. “It gets a lot of guys experience.”
When it comes to Idaho, the team is not treating them any differently from a Pac-12 opponent.
“We have to look at them as if they’re the best,” Hawkins said. “So we can do our jobs.”
Sophomore wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, likewise, isn’t taking the team’s week two opponent lightly.
“Idaho is going to give it their all,”  because they’re playing against USC,” Smith-Schuster said.
Even though Smith-Schuster is only a sophomore, he’s already aiming to emerge as one of the team’s unsung leaders.
“You don’t need a ‘C’ on your chest to be a captain,” he said.
In practice, Smith-Schuster has been seen as the type of player who is always communicating with his teammates, on the field and on the sidelines.
Against Arkansas State, Smith-Schuster was double-teamed  frequently.  Instead of  becoming frustrated by double coverages,    Smith-Schuster decided that he was going to embrace it and uses it as motivation.
He is also happy about the advantage that the double-teams give to his teammates because it , in turn, makes it easier on them to get the ball and score.
“If I win on double-team, it looks good for NFL scouts,” Smith-Schuster said. “I love it.”
The No. 8 Trojans will return to Howard Jones Field for one final practice before taking on Idaho at the Coliseum on Saturday night.

Week one of college football certainly delivered. Apart from USC’s 55-6 trashing of Arkansas State, marquee matchups — Alabama vs. Wisconsin and Arizona State vs. Texas A&M — lived up to expectations.
We now know that Arizona State should never have been ranked No. 15 and Alabama’s defense looks scary good.
While these games certainly stick out to any normal fan, you’ll find some rather interesting storylines if you dig deeper.
No. 21 Stanford fell to unranked Northwestern and UCLA’s Josh Rosen had a near perfect debut, passing for 351 yards and three touchdowns while completing 28 of 35 passes.
In fact, Rosen’s first game, against unranked Virginia — a team that has not won a road game in three years — went so well that many experts now have UCLA as their pick to win the Pac-12 and make the College Football Playoff.
This sounds awfully familiar. Just last year, it seems this same exact situation happened.
On opening weekend last season, No. 21 Texas A&M traveled to Columbia to take on then-No. 9 South Carolina. Led by quarterback Kenny Hill, the Aggies crushed the Gamecocks 52-28.
Hill, who was making his first start for the Aggies after the departure of former Heisman winner Johnny Manziel, went 44-60 for 511 yards and three touchdowns.
Texas A&M was thrust into the top 10, jumping 12 spots to No. 9, and even receiving two first-place votes.
Hill immediately found himself in the national spotlight, leading the conversation for Heisman and giving himself the nickname Kenny “Trill.”
Fast forward a few months and the Aggies finish the season 8-5 (3-5) and find themselves outside the final top 25 poll.
Kenny “Trill” decides to transfer to TCU after losing the starting job to Kyle Allen in the aftermath of an embarrassing 59-0 loss at the hands of Alabama.
Last year’s Texas A&M team is just one example of how preseason rankings are misleading.
USC was ranked No. 1 in 2012, and we all know how that ended. It seems that Oklahoma is always ranked in the top 10 year after year despite their last National Championship being 15 years ago.
Even the Aggies find themselves in the same position as last season — defeating a top ranked team at a “neutral site” and vaulting into the national conversation.
Preseason hype will forever be a factor in all sports, professional and collegiate. However, there are steps that the NCAA could take to temper the hype a little.
Instead of releasing preseason polls, why not wait until the third or fourth week to release the initial poll?
Under this scenario, most teams would have the opportunity to play at least one quality opponent to show they deserve to be ranked in the top 25.
Take this week for example. No. 7 Oregon will travel to East Lansing to take on No. 5 Michigan State.
The loser of this game will almost certainly fall out of the top 10, so what is the point of having them ranked so high at the beginning of the season?
This week alone, three new teams jumped into the top 25 — Texas A&M, Mississippi State and Utah.
Next week you can expect even more teams to drop in and out of the top 25 as there are numerous high quality matchups.
Besides Oregon vs. Michigan State, some of the key games this week include No. 14 LSU vs. No. 25 Mississippi State, No. 20 Boise State vs. BYU and No. 19 Oklahoma vs. No. 23 Tennessee.
Basically, we could be looking at possibly 5-7 new teams in the top 25 after just two weeks.
While I know this is about as unrealistic as it gets, I can still dream for the day I can turn on SportsCenter and not see Kirk Herbstreit declaring the next national champions after one week, right?
But who knows?
Maybe Josh Rosen will be that good and UCLA will win the Pac-12. Maybe USC will surprise everyone and go undefeated.
Or maybe Rosen will be average and the Bruins will go 8-4. Maybe the Trojans will endure a mediocre season. Nobody knows until the games are played.
So what’s the point of all that preseason hype?

When asking about redshirt sophomore Chris Hawkins around practice, the thing people will hear about most from USC coaches is undoubtedly his football IQ.
“It’s just being in my playbook and studying the opponent,” Hawkins said after Wednesday’s practice.  “I study them nonstop. When I am not in class, I constantly have my iPad open, looking at the other teams’ tendencies on third down, second down and first down so I am able to really know what they’re trying to do.”
In his first game as a starting safety for the Trojan defense, Hawkins collected an interception and fumble recovery in Saturday night’s convincing win against Arkansas State. And while safety was among the potentially problematic positions for USC entering the 2015 season, Hawkins’ recent success in the backfield will surely add depth to coach Keith Heyward’s defensive back unit which also includes freshmen Ykili Ross and Marvell Tell III.
“We have a lot of talent back there with Kevon Seymour and the two returning starters,” Hawkins said. “It’s like I am the new guy. But I have to be the quarterback from the back end and that’s what I am really back there for, helping everybody get lined up and knowing exactly where they should be going.”
Last season, USC’s secondary ranked 118th in pass defense by allowing almost 275 passing yards per game. But, Saturday night, starting safeties Chris Hawkins and John Plattenburg played superbly, combining for 10 tackles, including one for a loss.
“His versatility really helps us,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said after the game. “He has a really high football IQ, and he can help a lot of the younger players in the back end.”
Last season, Hawkins saw his first action at USC and played in 11 games as a redshirt freshman, making 32 tackles and one interception. Though he began the season as a starting cornerback, his struggles with adjusting to college play, including penalties, caused him to be replaced by Adoree’ Jackson in the fifth game of the season.
Hawkins’s abilities at safety first caught USC coaches’ eyes during last season’s Holiday Bowl when he briefly lined up at the position because the Trojans were short on bodies. Since then, Hawkins has adapted well to his new position, capitalizing on his vast football intelligence even more.
“Coach asked me to play safety last spring,” Hawkins said. “I learned it fairly easily, I would say. I had some ups and downs here and there, but I’ve been able to really stick to the position to try to learn everything about it. I feel like I am doing very well so far.”
Hawkins has been impressive during the spring and into the fall at the safety position and appears  comfortable playing over the top of the defense.
“He’s a natural safety,” outside linebacker Su’a Cravens said. “He knows how to read plays. He’s really good at understanding route concepts and diagnosing routes.”
Coming to USC, Hawkins was one of the top corners in the 2013 class out of Rancho Cucamonga High School. His 2012 honors included Prep Star All-American Dream Team, ESPN 150, Rivals 100, Orange County Register Fab 15 first team, Tacoma News Tribune Western 100 and All-CIF Inland Division as a senior cornerback.
His USC coaches believe that Hawkins’s famed football IQ can provide a trusted defensive play caller in the backfield.
“Chris is a smart player who studies the game extremely hard,” defensive back coach Keith Heyward said after practice Wednesday. “That is what he does and that is what safeties need to do because they have to make the checks and the calls from the backend. He does a great job at that, and he takes it seriously. He has made the adjustment just fine.”
Hawkins will certainly look to build off of his most successful first game as a Trojan Saturday night against an Idaho team that struggled with the passing game last season. In 2014, Vandal quarterback Matt Linehan had the third most attempts among freshmen behind only Arizona’a Anu Solomon and Miami’s Brad Kaaya. He completed 58.3 percent of his passes and threw 18 interceptions.
When asked about his goals for this upcoming season, Hawkins said he is very focused on doing whatever it takes to help his team win games.
“Just to win the Pac-12 championship,” Hawkins said. “I have no individual goals besides that because those will come naturally if I am doing what I am supposed to be doing.”

A solid start to the 2015 season has propelled the USC women’s volleyball team to new heights in the national rankings. The undefeated Women of Troy (6-0) have jumped from No. 22 in the polls to start the season to         No. 6 overall, heading into the third week of regular season play.
Of the six matches already played, USC has defeated three top 15 opponents and earned five straight 3-0 sweeps.
“I have really enjoyed the way our kids have played, and I like that they’ve had fun competing,” head coach Mick Haley said.
This week, the Women of Troy will carry their undefeated record into the Galen Center when they host the USC Classic Sept. 10-12.
Four teams will visit Troy for the three-day tournament, with Utah State, Pepperdine, Idaho State and New Mexico all on the schedule to play USC.
USC will begin the tournament facing off against Utah State on Thursday morning.
The Women of Troy and the Aggies (2-5) will meet for the first time in nearly 14 years, with USC holding the edge in the overall series record, 7-1.
Thursday night, USC will face off against Pepperdine. The Waves (6-1) are coming off their first loss of the season last weekend at the Lipscomb Invitational and will be looking to get back on track against USC. The Women of Troy, however, have gotten the best of the Waves most recently, winning the last five consecutive meetings.
It will be another early morning match on Friday for USC when they host Idaho State at 10 a.m.
The Bengals (5-2) and the Women of Troy have only met twice, with USC winning both meetings.
The Women of Troy will then take on New Mexico on Friday night.
The Lobos (4-2) were picked to finish fifth  in the Mountain West Conference this season and are coming off a 2-1 record at the Lobo Classic in Albuquerque. USC leads the overall series, 5-1, and has won the last four matches against New Mexico.
The matches against Pepperdine and New Mexico will both be broadcast live on the   Pac-12 Networks.
As the team will look to build upon its hot start this weekend, Haley is already very impressed with his team’s play thus far.
“I can’t say enough about this team,” Haley said. “Samantha Bricio and Alicia Ogoms as seniors have been really good with their leadership, and to see sophomore Brittany Abercrombie be the kind of player we always thought she could be and more is great.”
The all-around play of senior captain Bricio in the early season has also earned her recognition throughout the conference. Bricio won her second straight Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week award this week after being named Most Valuable Player of the 2015 University of Northern Iowa Tournament in Cedar Falls, Iowa.
This was the seventh time in Bricio’s career that she has been chosen for MVP honors at a      pre-conference tournament.
During the tournament, Bricio became just the sixth USC player to collect 1,000 digs and 1,500 kills in her career.
Despite her personal accolades, the All-American outside hitter is quick to praise her team first and foremost.
“This team is amazing. We all have a connection, and it has been really fun to play with each other,” Bricio said. “All the work that we’ve been doing in the spring and during the fall is really paying off.”
Sophomore opposite hitter Abercombie agreed with Bricio about the team dynamic.
“I think our team unity and our fight has been there, so we’ve all just been feeding off of each other and playing really well,” Abercrombie said.
When previously asked about his team’s performance early on in the season, Haley said that these pre-conference tournaments could be very telling as the team moves forward.
“The first four weeks of the season are kind of ‘foolers’ because people don’t do a lot to prepare for you since they’re trying to prepare their own teams,” Haley said. “But by the time we get to the end of September, we’ll get to know a lot more about our team.”
Well the three top fifteen opponents have become one which is BYU. Kentucky is now 22nd with three loses while No. Carolina has dropped out of the top 25 completely being 27th. How can USC label this tournament a Classic with all the bottom feeder teams involved except for maybe Pepperdine U. who is decent. Matches at 10 AM are a real draw on a weekday.

Melbourne hosts a collection of diverse enclaves, and food is definitely a uniting factor in each one. With experimental flavors and unconventional concepts implemented into the cooking, food provides an experience beyond refueling. Eating becomes adventuring.
I was first made aware of the experiences I could have with food during my first brunch in Melbourne. I have always enjoyed brunch, but brunch in Melbourne is not just a meal — it’s a way of life. Restaurant and cafe hours reflect just how much emphasis is placed on the meal: the majority of cafes open at 7 a.m. and close by 4 p.m.
Each district of town, whether it be the Central Business District, Fitzroy, Carlton, Prahran or St. Kilda provides eateries with unique takes on the meal that reflect the environment. In Fitzroy, a haven for hipsters, one can find cafes boasting vegan and gluten-free options, along with fusion menus that require dictionaries. In the pedestrian streets of CBD, urbanites gather in long lines between work at brasseries with outdoor seating, provided weather permits.
Presentation is an important element in the Melbourne food scene. The architecture and distinct décor of eating areas reflect the emphasis placed on the environment surrounding the food. Even the food court in the mall has spectacular high ceilings with dangling lights and an industrial and modern atmosphere.
The same painstaking attention given to the physical appearance of the establishment is given to the food. I have seldom come across an unattractive plate — in fact, around 75 percent of the photos I have taken are of food. The combination of flavors in a plate — celeriac purée with field mushrooms, tomato and potato frittata with saffron aioli, sautéed kale with za’atar and fried eggs, to name a few — only enhance the overall experience.
The experimental nature of food can be most accurately described by the epic hot chocolates found throughout Melbourne. Nestle and Hershey’s are not even considered here, where even drinking hot chocolate, a sweet way to warm up without over-caffeinating, can be a process. Some methods of making the drink are as simple as pouring warm chocolate over a cloud of fairy floss, while others include changing the chocolate’s state of matter by melting it gradually into steamed milk.  Several places feature infused hot chocolates, including combinations with peanut butter, Nutella, salted caramel, chili and other flavors that complement chocolate in a satisfying and surprising manner.
Dessert in general encourages a new level of nuance in the culinary experiments. Almost every eatery boasts  a distinct sweet offering, whether that means incorporating marshmallow in four different forms, shoving plastic syringes of chocolate ganache into ice cream cones or stuffing croissants with lychee and raspberry conserve.
The dessert competition and continuing movement toward innovation effectually drove Australia into a Nutella shortage. The main culprit is not my personal consumption, but rather the raging popularity of Nutella filled doughnuts, which have even made appearances in convenience markets.
Food in Melbourne truly presents a reflection of the Melbourne way of life. Eating is an event, a means to take you on a cultural or gastronomic journey. Along with the emphasis on brunch culture, Melbourne provides a hub that celebrates internationalism. In the mall food court, the overwhelming options are tantalizing; journeys to Malaysia, India, China, Greece, Italy, Korea and more are all within reach. The food is mirrored in the people living in the city, as it’s common to hear different languages buzzing around at any point during the day. The city is covered with scattered corridors that serve as epicenters for different cultures. Even walking down central streets, it is hard to avoid restaurants that serve photogenic food.
The markets throughout the city feed into the food culture as well. Buying groceries from the market is a weekly staple in the Melbourne lifestyle. The market, though, provides more than just vendors in produce and the delicious smell of baked goods in the early morning. The market is the gathering spot for families on a Sunday, as children run around petting chickens for sale while parents enjoy their coffees. In the summer and winter, it features food vendors at night, serving a variety of delights, including soups in bread bowls,  while people twirl around in a silent disco. The market is a collection of Melbourne’s diversity — it’s where a one-man band stands across from a woman dressed like a lizard on stilts.
So, when people ask what food is distinctly characteristic of Melbourne, I would say it’s a cross section between all the foods of the world, especially that of South East Asia and Greece. The combination of eccentric and provincial takes on simple foods make it safe to say that eating has become an integral part in my stay here thus far.

For years, Nathaniel Rateliff has been one of the most underrated voices in the music industry. His unique blend of R&B and gospel has produced many soulful tracks. In 2013, Rateliff formed his own band, Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats. Since then the band has taken off, with their breakout single “S.O.B.” and an electrifying performance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Tonight, the band plays a sold out show at The Regent Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Before their event, Rateliff gave some insight into his creative drive in a phone interview with the Daily Trojan.
 
Daily Trojan: Music critics have noted that they are drawn to your voice, which is a unique marriage of many musical styles. What music influences does your voice stem from?
 
Nathaniel Rateliff: I kind of wanted to do something that was reminiscent of R&B and soul, like Sammy Davidson, Otis Redding, and then I also wanted to have the band mixed in there. So, a little bit of rhythm and blues and honky-tonk is in my music as well. I don’t know, I grew up singing along to all my favorite records, so, over the years, I also sang that way. In my past records, I kind of sang more singer-songwriter stuff, sometimes in a baritone voice. It’s kind of a mixture of things, and I just voice appropriately to match the song.
 
DT: You grew up in Missouri and then relocated to Colorado, where music styles like bluegrass and soul are popular. How did your upbringing further influence your voice?
 
NR: Yeah, you know, my dad was also really into music, so he had everything from Van Morrison to other music influences in the house. When I was younger, I wasn’t really interested in bluegrass and country because there were tons of rednecks where I grew up, and they were basically the enemy. But now that I’ve gotten older, it’s kind of funny because I identify with being a redneck more.
 
DT: Specifically for USC students, sometimes getting started is not a matter of talent but rather finding the right people. You have a seven-piece band, with a multitude of different types of instruments. With so many people, how did you get your band started?
NR: Well, [lead guitar player Joseph Pope III] and I, we’ve been playing together for 21 years. We grew up in the same town in Herman, Missouri. His older brother was one of my first roommates when I moved out when I was 15. [Drummer Patrick Meese] … has played with me for eight years. [Keyboardist Mark Shusterman] has been with us for three or four years. Andy Wild, who plays the saxophone, is a buddy of mine, and I’ve had him play on a couple records. Wesley Watkins, is another friend around town and a great trumpet player. And actually we have Adam Schackner, who has been in a bunch of bands, and he plays the baritone saxophone, so he can kind of play anything through his own jive. And then Luke Mossman has been with us since Denver and is just a really great guitarist. You can always count on him to fill in a spot. When you’re putting people together, you’re not always thinking about how well they play, but how easy it is to hang out with them because you’re basically living with them. A lot of it is just persistence. [Pope] and I continue to make records and put out music and endure the expense of our relationships and even financial stuff. You know, you just try to make ends meet when you’re home. We’ve slept on a lot of people’s floors. We’ve been touring for years, so it’s just never been that easy.
DT: What is the creative process like with your band?
NR: For this record, and for most records I’ve done, I kind of start off by writing and recording the song, and I’ll make a demo of it. I’ll play drums and bass and the guitar, pretty much anything that I’m capable of doing until I run into a particular technical on the keys I can’t play or horn or some organ part I can’t play. Usually, you just start working on a song at home and hash it out. Things will change a bit once the band is involved. I think for the next record we might be able to have somewhat of a different sound. A band, you know, kind of creates things as we go along. So I think that will kind of change with time. Mostly, these past couple of years has been me demoing stuff out-hashing it out on my own.
 
DT: Since your appearance on Jimmy Fallon, you’ve been touring the talk-show circuit on top of being on the road for your own shows. Now that you’ve gained more recognition, how has the transition to the spotlight been for you and your band?
 
NR: We’re still figuring it all out. We’ve been on tour and trying to set up this record since the spring. We’ve been to Europe three times already and Canada and New York, and now we’re on the road. As far as transitioning, like I said, we’ve been doing this for years, but it is a little different now that, since Jimmy Fallon and the records have done well. People do act a little differently around us, which is weird, but we just try to make it so that we’re approachable and humble about everything that’s happening. You work for a long time to have something good happen.
 
DT: “S.O.B.” features very defying, vivid lyrics. How did you arrive at the words for your song?
 
NR: At first, I had an idea for the song as a sing-along. There’s an older doo-wop song that had a similar melody to that, and I thought it would be cool to have a gospel-like sing-along to that. I just tossed around the idea and was joking around with the whole “son of a b*tch” thing. It kind of came together. I had an experience when I was away from home once that I quit drinking ,and I ended up having drink tremors. It was a pretty scary, horrible experience. So, I was trying to make light of that, that it’s toxic for everyone’s families. I just tried to make it a little light-hearted, but at the same time, I was also calling myself out. I’m just trying to be honest with myself.
 
DT: Do you have any advice for USC students aspiring to break it into the music scene?
 
NR: If you discover that you like playing music, and you want to do it, I would recommend that you don’t make it your career. But if you’re interested in that, I think the only advice is to find people that you love, who love playing music and want to do it with you and to stick it out. Do what makes you happy, and if you’re lucky, it’ll make other people happy too.

Let’s be frank: School ain’t a cake walk. As a premier, private research university, USC is academically rigorous and challenging. As students, we work and study hard in order to fully engage in our studies and learn. With multiple classes, papers, exams and numerous assignments, things can get hectic and stressful very quickly. Mix in family, friends and extracurricular activities, and keeping everything together becomes one tall order for young people. We often overlook how much of our academic performance is rooted in outside factors rather than our personal ability. The pressure of a high GPA and stellar grades often shames us into thinking we’re not good enough to succeed. That sort of philosophy could not be further from the truth. Succeeding academically is much more than personal ability, and there is one office on campus that works to directly combat that ideology. Regardless of its relative obscurity, the Office of Academic Review deserves more respect and students should take more advantage of its presence.
OAR aims to work with students who are struggling academically — namely those who are on academic probation. When working and communicating with OAR, it’s incontrovertible to say it is absolutely superb. In terms of professional performance, productivity and overall status, it is USC’s hidden gem.
Undergraduate Student Government and the Rini-Jordan administration have spearheaded mental health care initiatives this semester, underscoring the importance of offering care and support to students who may be overcome with stress, fatigue or mental health issues. In the spirit of these positive and progressive platforms, resources on campus should be utilized. OAR is one resource and avenue students can take to seek the help they need if they are struggling.
Led by a staff of well-trained, informed and competent counselors, OAR helps students perform better by consulting and guiding them through any academic or non-academic issues they may have. The staff understands what it is like to be a student and the stress that college often entails. In the huge pond that is the USC community, OAR is the source of guidance that USC touts during recruitments, tours and marketing campaigns.  They serve students with respect and dignity and transform a stressful scenario into simpler steps that are easier to digest and process.
Let’s say you missed a final or midterm and you have to drop a class. You’re panicking — how do you move ahead with your schedule? OAR can help you make contingency plans or re-work a planned schedule to accommodate for setbacks. They’re the type of people who offer genuine help and support and don’t expect anything in return.
OAR is virtually unknown to many students. Most people will only recognize the office if they or someone they know has been on probation, or if they happen to be lingering around Pardee and Marks Tower and stumble upon it near Figueroa Street. Little do students know, however, the office can help students schedule classes and calculate GPAs, as well as address a series of other student needs.
To students: If you’re stressed about classes or an exam, you have no reason not to stop by the office and utilize the services you’re already paying for. Whatever your problem may be, OAR is perhaps the best resource for students on campus. While department and major counselors often see floods of students, OAR is an alternative avenue to answer any questions students may have. More importantly, the staff is present when students need help the most.
Though other offices and organizations may receive more attention or praise, it’s time more students take advantage of the Office of Academic Review.

In a move that cemented Los Angeles’s run for the 2024 Olympics, the U.S. Olympic Committee endorsed the city as its candidate for the Games last week. The endorsement has revitalized the spirits of Angelenos and Trojans alike, reviving fond memories for USC alumni who were on campus when the University helped host the 1984 Games and raising hope for those who plan to be in Los Angeles in 2024. For the University, another chance to host the Games would both bolster the school’s international reputation and provide an unforgettable experience to students.
As many Angelenos and Southern California residents will attest, the 1984 Games left a memorable and lasting legacy on Los Angeles. L.A. arrived on the scene at a time when the International Olympic Committee and the Olympics were in egregiously poor shape. The United States had boycotted the previous 1980 Games in Moscow because of Cold War tensions and the political gamesmanship that marked that era. Few countries even wished to bid for the 1984 Games as previous hosts had spent millions of dollars to host, only to lose money. In 1984, the L.A. Games, led by business executive Peter Ueberroth, changed the narrative surrounding the Olympics and produced one of the most successful Olympic Games to date, garnering a cadre of sponsors, appealing across the globe with media and TV deals and boasting a $250 million surplus. Many venues supporting the Games, including USC, were left with a lasting impact. The campus was used to house athletes in the Athletes Village and the infrastructure built was later converted to dining halls and dormitories for future students. Café 84, for instance, was built for and is named after the 1984 Games.
With all the success that ’84 brought, Los Angeles and USC only stand to benefit from hosting the 2024 Olympic Games. By 2024, 40 years after 1984 and 28 years since the Olympics were in the United States, a whole generation of Americans will not have seen an Olympic Games on their own soil.
Aside from general favorable publicity, hosting the Games at USC reinforces the University’s role as an international institution. Just as it did in 1984, the 2024 Olympics could expose students even more to the global citizenship for which it stands. The University has for years forged a legacy of offering a global education — even in 1930, USC ranked third in the United States for international enrollment. Having lost the number one spot last November, the Games could continue the narrative that USC is a place for an education that truly transcends national borders.
Though arguably we aren’t wanting for it, the Games could revitalize  school and national pride. The years approaching 2024 will likely attract even more competitive applicants to the University and could be a chance to further advance USC’s national and international prestige.
The Games’ costs to the University, however, must be also be considered. And though USC will have already begun a $500-million overhaul of the Coliseum by the time more definitive decisions about the Games will be made, hosting the Olympics will most likely pose a real cost to the University in the form of renovations and updates. However, considering that much of the same infrastructure exists from the 1984 Games, structural updates will not be as extensive as they would be for other host cities — so the University’s hosting would be more cost-effective.
The 2024 Games represents a golden opportunity for USC, its students and all Angelenos to show the world the strength and vitality of Los Angeles. A sprawling anti-metropolis resistant to any traditional or orthodox convention of a city, Los Angeles is constantly reinventing and being reinvented. Los Angeles in 1984 is not the Los Angeles today and will not be the same Los Angeles in 2024. The Southland will not be without competition, however. Paris, France; Hamburg, Germany; Rome, Italy; and Budapest, Hungary, have all submitted bids to host.  Paris has hosted the Olympics once in 1924, Rome in 1960, while Hamburg and Budapest have never hosted an Olympics. Los Angeles has the experience to successfully put on an Olympic Games in a time where the IOC is still reeling from accusations of corruption and criticism of quid pro quo politics and tactics. While Rome and Paris may seem like ostensible, exotic choices, L.A. is truly a global city and there is no better fit and time for the city to host the XXXIII Olympiad.

This fall, when I took the offer to be design director of the Daily Trojan, I looked forward to two things. The first was the increased exposure of my designs to a larger audience than my usual Facebook circle. Second, I saw ever-growing potential in the paper and was excited to see how the many new ideas I had could transform it.
My excitement, however, fizzled when multiple people asked me, “What do you even do there?” These six words called into question how much of an impact I could make with a skill that seemed so “easy,” while simultaneously extinguishing the tiny fire of passion in my heart. I stumbled back a few steps, questioning for the first time what design really meant to this generation and, personally, to me.
In this digital age of information overload, text presented on its own — be it in magazines, online articles, or textbooks — can no longer hold a reader’s attention for long. Most of us no longer process information when it’s presented in text-dense form. We scan and skim for key phrases that we’re on the lookout for. Name the last time you read an article of 1,000 words, every single word from top to bottom and fully understood what it was about without having been interrupted by a distracting sidebar or another headline. What about the last time you clicked on a link because the picture attached was intriguing? Or the time you gave up reading a long essay because you scrolled all the way down and couldn’t find one single picture that made you stay. 
With this evolution in the way we read, it only seems natural that there should be an increase in appreciation for design.
Design is not easy. It has never been easy. It is a time-consuming process full of trials and errors with infinite room for improvement. I hear the statement, “That looks about right” pretty often, but it breaks my heart every the time. The end product might look easy and put together, but what isn’t seen are countless decisions regarding balance, contrast, color, composition, scale and organization.
Each decision is crucial because it dictates the next decision we make. If anything is missing at one point, we fall back a few steps. Each rule we follow dictates the next rule we make, and most, if not all, elements have to follow that rule. But, of course, there are times when you have to break your own set of rules and start over — especially when clients have so many requests.
“It looks so empty. Can you fill it up by stretching it?”
“It needs to be more lively and fun.”
“Can you fit more text onto this page?”
“Make it bigger.”
In these adjustment calls, one thing has been forgotten — great design provides comfort in a subtle manner. Designers filter information for the audience and connect the subject matter in the most direct manner,but seamlessly and naturally. So, no, we refuse to enlarge any elements because white space is crucial. It allows one to focus the most important message being delivered and yields room for the overall artwork to “breathe.” No, we refuse to fit more text into this page to reduce cost because it will become difficult to read when you have to squint your eyes in order to read the next line. And, no, we are not filling up the empty space by simply stretching our text.
We have already considered all aspects when thinking of how to make this product the best it can be. We think about how your eyes will move from one element to the next. We think about the associated emotions that will come along with the presented information. We think about how our work will affect you. We design for you.
With that goal in mind, my design team and I want to help define the Daily Trojan by offering you an enjoyable reading experience. We want to create designs that are simple, clean and straightforward. We make graphics that captures the essence of an article. We collaborate with multimedia to give you options. We want you to remember us and appreciate the thought that went into the simple beauty of a layout.
With that said, I want to thank my fellow editors for their continuous support and appreciation of my team. I also would like to thank you for stopping by and reading about design from an insider’s perspective. I hope sharing my thoughts will inspire you to see and appreciate design from another perspective. 
Samantha Lee is a junior majoring in architecture. She is also the design director of the Daily Trojan.

The line wrapping around TroGro at any given hour says it all. On campus, there is perhaps nothing more ordinary than a college kid clenching a cup of coffee.
According to the National Coffee Association, 54 percent of Americans over age 18 are daily drinkers, but surprisingly, as a study by Nehlig et al. states, caffeine is the most widely consumed central nervous system stimulant, or, in other words, a commonly used psychoactive drug.  Though caffeine is obviously not considered a controlled drug, similarities to illegal drugs in terms of withdrawal symptoms. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders listed caffeine withdrawal as a symptom of the now-recognized disorder of caffeine addiction. 
Americans love coffee because, to put it simply, caffeine wakes the brain up. Once ingested, caffeine gets to work quickly as well. For some, it only takes 45 minutes to feel a caffeine high, which, according to the Food and Drug Administration, raises blood pressure and increases heart rate.
The reason caffeine is near and dear to the hearts of college students is that
with a little twisting and tightening, it mimics adenosine, a neurotransmitter that usually slows down nerve cell activity. Because caffeine looks like adenosine to the adenosine receptors in the brain, it can bind to but is unable to activate the receptors, essentially blocking them and temporarily turning them off. Without adenosine to keep dopamine and glutamate in check, levels of these two excitatory neurotransmitters soar, making drinkers feel awake and attentive.
Caffeine withdrawal is especially painful, not necessarily because of this
biological mechanism, but because of dependence and tolerance — the fallout of addiction. If you have ever hung around anyone experiencing caffeine withdrawal, you would easily recognize the symptoms. From anywhere between seven days and two months, the DSM-5 lists headaches, lethargy and extreme irritability as a few of the symptoms. In the severest of cases, withdrawal can manifest itself as congestion, constipation and vomiting.
As a Coffee Bean regular, not even the notion of eight weeks of non-stop
migraines can keep me away from my hot cup of coffee in the morning — so here are a few tips to keep caffeine withdrawal at bay (if you ever do choose to take a much-needed break):
It is important to remember that caffeine is a drug, and when it comes to overcoming addiction, taking it day by day is the key. If you are drinking four cups of coffee a day try switching to decaf or drink less caffeinated teas instead.
As I am sure most regular coffee drinkers know, caffeine is a diuretic — it makes you dehydrated. Drinking water can also help with those coffee headaches.
Exercising, going outside and listening to music are just a few ways to boost your mood without relying on caffeine.
Whether you drink coffee to stay awake or for the taste, it is important to recognize the effect it has on your brain and your body. As with many things in life, moderation is the key!
