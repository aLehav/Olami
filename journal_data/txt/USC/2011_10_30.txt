To Vanessa: Are you so intelligent to be at Stanford? What a classless statement.
Loved seeing The Stanford Band and Tree on GameDay.
I love their free spirit and energy.  I know many students at USC wish that they had had the grades to get into a school like Stanford.
@ Vanessa:
3.9 GPA, and chose not to apply to Stanford.  Why?  Because when I visited and talked to students, this happened with nearly every single one.
1.) I ask what they like about Stanford.
2.) They give a 15 second response and then ask what other schools I am applying to.
3.) I mention USC on my list
4.) They go on a 5 minute rant about why I should never go to USC.  In other words, they spend more time why I shouldn’t go to SC than why I should go to Stanford.
Keep your application, Farm.

The USC School of Social Work Center for Innovation and Research on Veterans and Military Families in conjunction with the Institute for Creative Technologies is using state-of-the art technology to improve counseling for military service members and their families through the use of virtual patients.
The technology, which will serve as a key tool for classes  in the near future, will begin its third student testing trail this week.
The virtual patients are artificially intelligent, interactive agents that serve as a realistic clinical representation of a service member, veteran or military family member. The technology provides students with a chance to advance practical skills with realistic client interactions. The virtual patients can speak, express body language, show emotion and offer immediate feedback.
Jan Nissly, a research assistant professor, said the program focuses on training behavioral health providers on how to interview and assess military patients more accurately and effectively.
“A large number returning from having been deployed are not being able to access services [and] the system is overwhelmed,” Nissly said. “Civilian providers are found not up to speed on what it’s like to be a service member and so [returning service members] walk away. They try one time and if it doesn’t connect, there’s no second chance, that’s it.”
Nissly said the technology allows students to work with virtual clients, practicing their visiting skills to see what techniques receive positive reaction.
The new technology is unique to the USC School of Social Work, and no other program offers virtual human beings to train students in therapist-patient interactions.
Though this program is still in the early stages of development, volunteer social work students have participated anonymously in trials testing and critiquing the technology since April.
“We are optimistic that in 2012, we will have the virtual client being used in the classroom with USC School of Social Work’s students as a tool not only for the instructor, but individually as well, where students can go in and practice [with the virtual client] out of class,” Nissly said.
In the past, ICT partnered with the USC Keck School of Medicine to use the VPs in helping train physicians. Because of the need for more complex VPs to provide verbal feedback to help clinicians with interviewing skills, the USC School of Social Work has gathered a new team at ICT called the Natural Language and Dialogue Group to redesign the VP dialogue.

The Occupy USC General Assembly said it plans to focus on advocacy and  creating open forum, after the group held its second meeting Friday at Tommy Trojan.
Sit in · The Occupy USC General Assembly began to hammer out goals at its Friday meeting. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
Occupy USC, which began Oct. 25 as an offshoot of the national Occupy Wall Street movement, aims to increase its presence on campus.
“The main thing we wanted to work on as a movement was advocacy and getting people aware of what’s going on,” said Julia Wang, an occupy USC participant movement and sophomore majoring in neuroscience. “We are saying that people with the privilege should be more aware of what their position of power is.”
Occupy USC has no leaders to ensure everyone’s voice is heard, said Max Hoiland, a participant and senior majoring in film studies.
“It’s an attempt to create democracy in a real, genuine form,” Hoiland said. “The whole idea is that everyone does have the choice to participate — there’s no hierarchy.”
Elizabeth Gustafson, a USC alumna and participant, said she decided to join the movement because its broader cause could attract and bring together large groups of people.
“What I like about Occupy USC is that even though it’s focused on [specific issues], there’s a broader interest that appeals to a lot of people,” Gustafson said. “If any activism can take place, it’s at USC. It’s bringing all of the different causes together to build consciousness and awareness.”
The Occupy USC General Assembly action committee is currently focused on putting together a moment of silence for Wednesday in response to the police brutality that occurred at Occupy Oakland on Oct. 24.

USC on Friday became the first academic institution to house an operational quantum computer system.
The D-Wave One Adiabatic Quantum Computer, the first commercially available quantum computer, will be housed at the USC Viterbi Information Sciences Institute in Marina del Rey.

Viterbi School of Engineering Dean Yannis Yortsos said the research conducted on the machine will be historic.
“This is merely the first step in a much larger world,” Yortsos said.
Yortsos said the system will break new ground, much like the first commercially available computer in the United States, the Universal Automatic Computer (Univac).
“The D-Wave One Adiabatic Quantum Computer represents not merely the latest ancestor of Univac, but the next big leap — the advent of scalable quantum computing,” Yortsos said. “Truly, D-Wave Systems has created something revolutionary: a 128 qubit quantum chip that augurs the possibility of solving some of the world’s most complex optimization and machine learning problems.”
The $10-million computer was purchased by Lockheed Martin Corporation, a security and information technology company that is the largest provider of IT services, systems integration and training to the U.S. government. USC will work with Lockheed Martin to conduct research on the computer.
Lockheed Martin said in a press release that it hopes to harness the technology to solve relevant problems that are hard to address through established methods in a “cost-effective amount of time.”
Quantum computing has the potential to drastically increase the speed of computer functions. The D-Wave computer’s qubits are able to encode ones and zeros at the same time and place on the chip, whereas traditional computers can only hold one of the digits in a place at one time. Having two bits exist in the same place at the same time, a property called superposition, is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics.
The concept of superposition is often illustrated by a thought experiment Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger proposed in 1935. In the experiment, a cat would be placed in a box that is completely unobservable from the outside, where the cat would eventually be poisoned. Because Schrödinger’s cat is alive when placed in the box but will be dead at some point when it is in the box, an observer can only assume the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Superposition in the D-Wave computer is advanced through temperature manipulation.
The D-Wave system hardware is kept at 20 microKelvin, which is near absolute zero — the coldest possible temperature in the universe. This allows metals to become superconductors by removing their electrical resistance. The system is adiabatic, meaning there is no net heat loss or gain.
Yortsos said the computer will provide a new paradigm in the quest for faster and more secure computing, as the field is in its infancy.
“It wasn’t that long ago that quantum computing was the province of intellectual wonks and theorists,” Yortsos said.
Yortsos said the system would keep USC at the forefront of technological innovations.
“From its pioneering role in the protocols of the Internet, the Domain Naming System — .com, .net, .edu — grid computing, high-performance computing, e-science and artificial intelligence, ISI has been the agent of innovation for many of the greatest breakthroughs of the past four decades,” Yortsos said. “Next year, 2012, ISI will celebrate its 40th anniversary. I am very confident that … this agent has its best innovating still to come.”

The USC men’s golf team wraps up its fall season this week with a trip to Northern California to compete in the Gifford Collegiate Championship in San Martin, Calif.
In its last tournament, the Trojans led the pack in the first round of the U.S. Collegiate Championship and tied for third place at the end of the second round. Despite starting off strong, USC finished seventh overall.
Senior Steve Lim led USC tying for 13th overall at 1-under-par, notching four bogeys during his final round and 14 pars. Highly touted freshman Anthony Paolucci tied for 31st at 4-over-par.
“We were competing against four of the best teams in the country and we were right up there with them,” USC coach Chris Zambri said. “It felt great to be in contention up until that final round.”
Despite placing just seventh and 10th, Zambri said he is pleased with the Trojans’ play thus far. He believes in the talent of his squad, but also feels it needs to work on its efficiency to finish tournaments strong.
“We talked about what each guy needs to do and what each of the guys want to improve upon,” Zambri said. “We have bright kids on the team that are able to manage themselves and continue to improve each week.”
CordeValle Golf Club won’t be a foreign course to USC, as this will be the sixth consecutive year in a row the Trojans have played there. The the coaching staff believes the familiarity bodes well for the team.
“It is in Northern California and is a very good course,” Zambri said. “Five of our six guys have already played there so we have plenty of experience with it.”
The Gifford Collegiate Championship is hosted by UCLA. The Bruins are fresh off of a victory last week after placing first at the U.S. Collegiate Championship. Zambri realizes the championship is the perfect opportunity for his squad to face a tough UCLA squad.
“We are definitely cognizant of their program,” Zambri said. “We like to use it as motivation to help us continue to improve.”
Last year the Trojans tied for fourth at the Gifford Collegiate Championship. USC will compete against a field of 14 teams at CordeValle, including Stanford, Oklahoma, Washington, San Diego and 2010 NCAA champion Augusta State. It is the only NCAA golf event that uses a foursome format. The format pairs two players from one team with two players from another team.
The Trojans tee off Monday at CordeValle Golf Club. The event concludes Wednesday.

With the season winding down, the USC women’s soccer team has found a way to turn it up.
USC split its weekend matchups at Utah and Colorado, falling 3-0 to the Utes on Friday before rebounding for a 1-0 victory over the Buffaloes on Sunday afternoon. The win over Colorado marked the Women of Troy’s fourth win in five games and third shutout of the season.
“I’ve seen a lot more swagger from the girls the past couple weeks,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “It’s a noticeable difference both during the week’s practices and on game day. It’s what we were missing the first part of the year.”
USC played Colorado to a scoreless tie through 58 minutes before senior midfielder Brittany Kerridge found senior forward/defender Ashley Freyer for the game-winning goal, Freyer’s third netter on the season.
“I just kind of found the ball at my feet and one-timed it to Ashley,” Kerridge said. “It was a great shot.”
Freshman goalie Carley Pennington, filling in for regular starter sophomore Shelby Church, pitched a shutout for the Women of Troy, saving all three opportunities she had.
“Carley’s done a great job holding down the position and making some great saves for us,” Khosroshahin said. “You’ve got to give the back line credit as well. They’ve really stepped up their game. The whole group has looked a lot more determined.”
USC was up against more than just two conference opponents during the weekend. The raised elevation in the mountain region tested the team’s conditioning, but Khosroshahin said he couldn’t have been happier with how the Women of Troy handled the adversity.
“For the ladies to put out the effort they did [against Colorado] was remarkable,” he said. “Competing in raised elevation is probably one of the most difficult things to do and they did a very good job.”
Kerridge echoed similar sentiments.
“It was like being unable to catch your breath at all times,” the Kerridge said. “We had four days of practice in it and we hydrated really well, which helped a lot. I was really proud of the girls.”
USC wasn’t quite as sharp two days earlier against Pac-12 newcomer Utah. The Utes took the lead just two minutes into the game when freshman Katie Taylor scored on a deflected cross and the Women of Troy were never able to respond. The goal was the first of three in the first half for Utah, which was led by the two-goalie tandem of senior Hannah Turpen and sophomore Mulcock, who combined for six saves.
USC wraps up its season Friday against No. 2 UCLA in Westwood. The Women of Troy can finish just a game under .500 in conference play with a victory after an 0-5 start.

Facing some of the nation’s toughest squads in what proved to be a grueling test, the USC women’s cross-country team finished 12th at this weekend’s Pac-12 championships.
The 6-kilometer race circling Wigwam Golf Course in Litchfield, Ariz., pitted the Women of Troy against UCLA, Stanford, Oregon, California and the rest of the conference.
“The Pac-12 is the toughest cross country conference in the country,” USC coach Tom Walsh said. “We lacked the big race experience that you need to do well in a meet like this. But I am confident that we will learn from this experience and get better in the future.”
Junior Shelby Buckley finished first for the Women of Troy in 22:01 for 78th place overall. Freshman Erica Capellino and redshirt freshman Katie DeYoung followed, finishing in 22:41 and 22:43, taking home 92nd and 93rd, respectively.
Freshman Kira Soderstrom placed 97th with a time of 22:54 and fellow freshman Shannon Byrne finished in 23:18 at 105th place. Freshman Erin Robinson ran a 24:07 and finished in 109th. Sophomore Jaclyn Walles did not finish. the race.
The team’s overall average time was 22:44, 1:30 slower than that of Pac-12 champion Colorado.
“The Pac-12 race didn’t go as well as we wanted it to,” Walsh said. “It was a very difficult challenge for our five freshmen walk on athletes to mix it up with several NCAA and Footlocker All-Americans.”
The next step will be the regional championships in Palo Alto on Nov. 12 in the path to the NCAA national championships.
Walsh said last Thursday that he would evaluate the team after the Pac-12 championships.
Walsh has the option of sending a few individuals or a team of runners to regional championships, based on whom he believes has a better chance at qualifying for the national championships.
Though this season featured one of the youngest teams in USC’s competitive history, this year’s cross-country team has done promisingly well, according to Walsh.
With one or two more seasons of collegiate experience, the coaching staff feels this unit has much room to grow.
“I am happy with the progress that this team made throughout the season,” Walsh said. “Most of the girls on the team improved by 30-40 seconds from a year ago, and that is very impressive. I hope that the improvement continues as we move forward to track season in the spring, and into cross country next year.”
Colorado captured the first-place title, while Washington came in second and Stanford finished third.
You do mean to say that they finished in last right?

The streak — nearly two months  long — came to an end.
Heavy lifting · Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter led the Women of Troy with a team-15 kills in a win at No. 5 Stanford on Saturday. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
No. 5 Stanford snapped the No. 4 USC women’s volleyball team’s 12-game winning Friday in a three-game sweep (25-18, 25-14, 25-23) during the weekend.
Despite the loss, the Women of Troy (18-4, 13-2) bounced back quickly, sweeping No. 2 California on Saturday to remain in a tie for first-place with UCLA atop the Pac-12 standings.
Senior outside hitter Alex Jupiter was once again instrumental for USC, posting a game-high 15 kills against the Golden Bears (21-4, 11-4). But it was her season-high 18 digs that stood out. Leading an offense looking to rebound from the myriad of mistakes against the Cardinal (17-3, 11-3), Jupiter and company started the first set with a .484 hitting percentage and wound up finishing the match at .319.
“I was very excited about her defense and she had a stellar weekend all-around,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “She’s all over it on defense and is playing as well as anyone in the country right now.”
Making her first start of the season was highly-touted freshman Alexis Olgard, who didn’t disappoint with eight kills against one error on the day.
“Olgard seemed really comfortable on the court and she was great blocking at the net,” Haley said. “She gave us a bonus with 8 kills on offense and her being 6-foot-5 makes big difference for us.”
Sophomores Kate Fuller and Sara Shaw added 10 kills apiece on an offense run by senior setter Kendall Bateman, who finished the game with 40 assists and four blocks.
USC limited Cal outsde hitter Tarah Murrey to nine kills and four errors for a pedestrian .185 hitting percentage.
Against the Cardinal, though, USC was challenged, as it littered hitting errors throughout the match.
With the mistakes on offense, USC struggled to stop Stanford, as evidenced by the disparity between hitting percentages — .339 for Stanford and just .161 for USC.
The Cardinal was led by sophomore middle hitter Carly Wopat, who recorded 11 kills against zero errors in addition to a game-high eight blocks.
Outside hitter Rachel Williams also racked up a double-double, finishing up with 14 kills and 13 digs.
Stanford’s defense at the net proved the difference in the match as it outblocked the Women of Troy 13-4 with Wopat leading the way.
“Wopat was quick off the floor and Lauren [Williams] didn’t respond very well,” Haley said. “She and Kendall [Bateman] were having connection problems and they weren’t responding well to each other and we tried to force it, but we just couldn’t score.”
Even Jupiter’s heroics, which included 16 kills and 11 digs, couldn’t save the Women of Troy from losing their first match in 12 games. Jupiter passed Jasmina Marinkovic for second all-time on USC’s career kils list and became only the second player in USC history to top 1,700 kills in a career. She is 99 kills away from Jennifer Kessy’s school record of 1,799 kills, and with seven games left, she seems on track to break the record.
Sophomore hitter Sara Shaw contributed nine kills in the game against Stanford, albeit with six hitting errors. Jupiter with 11 digs for the second-most on the team. Senior middle blocker Lauren Williams had a poor showing Friday as she was not her usual dominant self, racking up six kills on 15 attempts.
Alexis Olgard is a Sophomore not a freshman. Anyone who followed the team last season would know she played a lot in her freshman year. This is plain bad reporting by you who did not take the time to double check the fact.

In early October, the USC men’s water polo team lost consecutive games in the SoCal tournament to Stanford and UCLA. But Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play, the No. 2 Trojans (15-2, 5-0) get an opportunity to avenge these two losses by playing those two teams again with conference seeding on the line.
Stingy defense · Senior goalie Joel Dennerley finished with 14 saves against Stanford, powering the Trojans to a 8-4 victory over the visiting Cardinal. The win improved USC’s overall mark in conference play to 5-0. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
In front of a raucous crowd at McDonald’s Swim Stadium on Parents Weekend, USC began its revenge tour well, thumping No. 3 Stanford 8-4. With the win, USC puts itself squarely in control of its own postseason standing, improving to 5-0 in MPSF play as the only unbeaten team in league play.
“We lost at Stanford last year in their house, and we really wanted to come back and get revenge,” redshirt sophomore driver Stephen Siri said. “They beat us in the SoCal tournament earlier this year, too, and we weren’t happy about the way we played.”
On Oct. 2 in the SoCal tournament semifinal round, USC’s offense, which only managed a season-low four goals, stalled against a physical Cardinal defense. This time, USC capitalized on its chances and exhibited strong shooting accuracy — something USC coach Jovan Vavic has stressed throughout this season.
“Offensively, we were more aggressive and were able to finish on some of our set plays,” senior goalie Joel Dennerley said. “Our six-on-five play was also much-improved.”
Up 3-1 in the second quarter, Dennerley, who notched 14 saves on the afternoon, headed a Stanford five-meter penalty shot off cage, transferring momentum to the Trojans after Stanford scored a goal to open the period.
With the two-goal lead intact, senior driver Peter Kurzeka looked to stake his team to more breathing room. Handling the ball at the point, Kurzeka pump-faked at least four times before delivering a laser into the bottom left corner of the net past Stanford goalie Brian Pingree. A six-on-five goal from redshirt freshman two-meter Jack Plaga with six seconds left in the quarter boosted the Trojans to a comfortable 5-1 advantage.
“We played excellent defense,” Dennerley said. “Overall, it was just a great team effort. Kurzeka really stood out on offense. We got a huge goal from Plaga. The two-meter men, [sophomore Jeremy] Davie and [redshirt junior Brian] Boswell, did a great job as well.”
Davie and Boswell, who combined for two goals, were strong in front of both cages all afternoon against a characteristically aggressive Stanford team. The two players battled for position on the offensive front for set pieces. Perhaps the goal of the afternoon occurred off a set play, when USC dumped the ball into Davie. In the midst of getting dunked under water and losing his swimming cap, Davie surfaced and spun around, whipping the ball into the Cardinal net, causing the crowd to erupt.
“The crowd was excellent,” Siri said. “I wish we could get that many people at every game. We love the Trojan Family, and it’s great to beat Stanford on Parents Weekend. It feels really good to get some revenge against them, but at the same time, we’re not satisfied, we’re going to keep working and grinding all the way to the NCAAs.”
Though USC has five games remaining, the Trojans’ greatest test will be against UCLA on Nov. 18, the final day of the regular season.
“We still have to face UCLA in the last game of the season,” Dennerley said. “They were our last loss, but we’re focusing on next week first. We’ll learn from this game, but also try to move forward.”

USC’s thrilling, triple-overtime showdown against Stanford ended with applause — not after a last-second game-winning field goal or a goal line stand from an oft-maligned defense.
It came after a fumble from Curtis McNeal, the junior tailback who rushed for a career-high 146 yards and two touchdowns on 20 carries Saturday.
Hordes of cardinal and gold clad fans in sections 12 and 13, which drape the southwest corner of the Coliseum, stood up following McNeal’s fumble that resulted in a 56-48 victory for Stanford, its 16th straight win. They didn’t file for the exits. They didn’t race to the parking lots. They didn’t try to beat traffic — something ingrained into the fabric of most Angelenos.
They stood up and cheered for a team that played hard, for four quarters and beyond, showing a form of resiliency that remains all the more difficult to gloss over in spite of the circumstances.
Fans stood — virtually motionless — to give a standing ovation to the players as they headed into the locker room, through the tunnel.
It was a loss, but it didn’t necessarily feel that way.
Saturday’s game against No. 4 Stanford was supposed to be akin to last season’s similarly hyped matchup with then-No. 1 Oregon. USC would hang around, sure, but come third quarter, the Cardinal, much like the Ducks, would pull away and would do so convincingly.
In reality, the Trojans led 20-10 in the third quarter against Stanford. Last year they led Oregon 32-29 in the third. Against Oregon, they never scored again. Against Stanford, they would score four more touchdowns.
“It’s almost hard to be a winner or a loser in that game,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said at the post-game press conference.
But there must be a winner.
Saturday’s defeat marks the second this season for the Trojans. They slip to 3-2 in the Pac-12 — tied with UCLA for second in the conference’s South division. They will now be forced to regroup before their season ends in less than a month.
It’s tempting to talk about moral victories in Saturday’s aftermath, but doing so feels insulting to the effort put forth by a number of Trojans.
“That’s not good enough for us,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said of moral victories. “All our guys are disappointed, because we know we had them.”
It’s been a messy year for USC football: sanctions, scholarship reductions, golf cart suspensions and failed appeals. You know the story.
But on Saturday, even in defeat, USC showed many fans what remains so special about college football.
No, nothing was pretty in the end. USC lost by eight points in overtime, even though it easily could have — maybe even should have — won. It committed two turnovers, a costly 15-yard personal foul penalty from junior safety T.J. McDonald on Stanford’s final drive of regulation, eventually leading to a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Stepfan Taylor.
Perhaps most glaringly, sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods never stepped out of bounds to give Kiffin enough time to call a timeout before the game was forced into overtime.
That’s what happens in a game that lasts long enough: Mistakes are made. This is college football. It is entertaining, it is exhilarating, but it has flaws.
There is bound to be a certain unpredictability in a sport played by 19 and 20-year-olds. Call it an imperfect masterpiece, if you will. USC played hard — not always smart — but that’s the way things go.
Its players represented the program more than adequately Saturday.
The Trojans went wire-to-wire with arguably the best team in the country. They shouldn’t keep their heads down. It’s tough, no doubt; the words “frustrating” or “disappointing” are probably insufficient descriptions — especially less than 48 hours removed from Saturday night’s heartbreaking loss.
But for the first time in what feels like a long time, most pollsters, most analysts and most fans are willing to concede USC is a good football team.
The reaction from the Trojan faithful was telling: This is something this program can build on. It isn’t the flashy signature win many insisted Kiffin needed. Nonetheless, it shows the program is alive and well.
No, it isn’t the annual national title contender most have grown accustomed to over the years.
But on probation, facing a wide variety of obstacles, USC has thrown aside the victim card, put its head down and trudged forward. It’s a top-25-quality team and it’s hard to refute that after what transpired against the Cardinal.
No one is supposed to celebrate losses; it’s frowned upon.
But after a rocky last 16 months, maybe tailored expectations are just fine. Maybe effort and character — what might often seem outdated in this current climate of college sports — are worth reveling in, at least for now.

USC coach Lane Kiffin said he was “extremely disappointed” with the way officials handled the timing dispute during the last play of regulation Saturday.
Upset · USC coach Lane Kiffin said he was told by an official he would be allowed to call a timeout with one second remaining in the fourth quarter. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
With nine seconds left and the game tied at 31 in the fourth quarter, USC had the ball on the Stanford 40-yard line.
USC ran one more play: a designed slip-screen for sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods, who was to take the ball quickly upfield to get a few more yards so the Trojans could call timeout to attempt a more manageable game-winning field goal.
Instead, Woods broke the play off toward the Stanford sideline, seemingly racing to get out of bounds despite the fact USC still had two timeouts remaining. He appeared to fall out of bounds with one second left, but the ruling on the field was that the clock ran down to zero and that the game would head to overtime.
“They said he was out of bounds [but] he wasn’t out of bounds,” Kiffin said. “So I told them, ‘When the replay comes back, you’re going to say his knee’s down.’”
Replays did show that Woods’ knee was down inbounds with one second left.
“I said [to the side judge], ‘You’re gonna review this,’” Kiffin said. “You’re gonna come back out and say y’all screwed up; he wasn’t out of bounds, his knee was down. Then you’re gonna say there’s one second on the clock. You gotta tell him [the referee] that we called a timeout here.”
According to Kiffin, the side judge told him that if the video review determined there was one second left on the clock, he would be granted a timeout.
The ball would have been placed on the Cardinal 33-yard line, leaving freshman kicker Andre Heidari with a 50-yard field goal attempt and a chance to win the game.
Heidari had hit from that same distance at the end of the second quarter.
“And they come back over and completely went against it,” Kiffin said. “So I’m extremely disappointed in that. That’s not an opinion, I’m not complaining about it. I’m just giving you the exact facts of the situation. Really disappointed in that.”
But referee Michael Batlan’s version of events differed from Kiffin’s.
“Through review, it was seen that the knee was down and time had expired and therefore we were headed to an overtime period,” Batlan said. “Any coach can ask for a timeout, but he doesn’t get one until an official grants or signifies it. I was not part of any conversation with regards to a requested timeout.”
Kiffin said he was told by an official that “if there was one second, [be] wouldn’t have had enough time to call a timeout,” a statement with which Kiffin strongly disagreed.
“I’ve been around football a long time,” he said. “You call timeouts with one second [left] all the time. It’s what you do, you call a timeout when the guy’s knee hits the ground and you get the play run.”
 
Quick hits
– Attendance was announced at 93,607, marking the first sellout at the Coliseum since  a 2009 game against Oregon State. Through five games this season, USC has averaged 73,056 fans per game.
– Saturday’s triple-overtime contest was also USC’s first overtime game since  Sept. 27, 2003, when it lost at California 34-31 in triple overtime. The Trojans are 3-6 all-time in overtime games.
Cheaters NEVER prosper.

A hushed silence fell over a sellout crowd of 93,607 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Saturday.
Last chance · Stanford recovers a fumble from junior tailback Curtis McNeal on the final play of Saturday night’s game. The Trojans had the ball at the Cardinal 4-yard line and trailed by eight points. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
For four quarters and almost three overtimes, No. 20 USC fought, scratched and clawed with No. 4 Stanford in a back-and-forth affair. In the third overtime, junior tailback Curtis McNeal took a handoff, on the verge of bringing USC (6-2, 3-2) within a two-point score of Stanford (8-0, 4-0). But the ball popped loose and slipped from his grasp. With it, the Trojans’ chances of upending the Cardinal slipped away, too, as Stanford escaped with a 56-48 victory.
“Both teams played extremely hard and played great football,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “It’s unfortunate that we were on the wrong end of it.”
Though Stanford managed to put up 56 points, the offensive outburst was not indicative of USC’s defensive play. Sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey picked off Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck and returned the interception for a touchdown late in the fourth quarter and the Trojans sacked Luck twice for a loss of 20 yards. Entering the game, Stanford’s offensive line had only allowed two sacks through seven games.
“I thought the defensive line did some good things, especially early on,” Kiffin said. “They really got after [Luck] versus a very good offensive line.”
And it was the defense that kept USC within striking distance of Stanford in the first half, limiting the Cardinal to just 10 points and 168 total yards for an offense that came in averaging just less than 49 points and more than 500 yards per contest. USC, however, was only able to manage two field goals in the first two quarters despite not much opposition from the Cardinal defense.
Because of the offense’s struggles in the first two quarters, the Trojans trailed 10-6 at halftime. But in the second half, the USC offense came alive. Junior quarterback Matt Barkley connected with sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods twice before the running game took over. On the third play of the drive, McNeal sprinted for a 61-yard touchdown run, giving USC a 13-10 lead. It was the first time Stanford had trailed all season.
A Stanford three-and-out gave way to USC’s offense, and it was McNeal who again gave the Trojans a lift. The Los Angeles native scampered 25 yards to the end zone for his second touchdown of the quarter, extending USC’s lead to 20-10. In the third quarter alone, McNeal finished with 11 rushes for 123 yards and two touchdowns. For the game, McNeal registered 20 carries for 139 yards and two scores.
“He played great for us all night long and came up with some huge plays,” Kiffin said. “He was banged up and it was great to see him play so well.”
Despite McNeal’s third quarter performance, Stanford hung around in part because of Luck’s play. The senior signal caller orchestrated drives of 75 yards and 86 yards to end the third quarter to give the Cardinal the 24-20 lead heading into the fourth. In the final quarter and three overtimes, Luck completed 12 of 17 passes for 94 yards and one touchdown to help Stanford avoid its first loss of the season.
“Luck is a great player, a great quarterback,” Robey said. “He played one of his best games. He came at us with all he could. Our defense did our job and did everything coach asked us to do. The chips just didn’t fall the way we wanted them to.”
Luck finished with 29-of-40 for 330 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Stanford’s vaunted running game, which had entered the contest averaging 5.1 yards per carry was limited to just 3.9 yards per carry. Running back Stepfan Taylor, who scored the game-winning touchdown, finished with 23 carries for 99 yards and two touchdowns.
On the other side, Barkley completed 28 of 45 passes for 284 yards, three touchdowns and one interception. Woods notched nine receptions for 89 yards and a score, while freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee finished with seven receptions for 94 yards and a touchdown, his fifth in six games. Freshman tight end Randall Telfer also notched five receptions for 45 yards and in the second overtime, broke a couple tackles and lunged past the goal line for his second score of the year.
Though the team took a top-five opponent down to the wire Saturday, the Trojans must regroup quickly as the face Colorado in Boulder, Colo., on Friday on a shorter week’s worth of practice.
“It hurts right now because we were so close,” Barkley said. “It was almost like it slipped away. Call it a moral victory or whatever you want to call it. It’s good that we took them to the wire, but it’s not good enough for us.”
Boston Cardinal: Go away and make nasty commments somewhere else. What a loser.
You guys are crazy. Unless TJ McDonald can change flight mid-air, there was no way to avoid the-above-the-shoulders hit. We hit hard in Trojans football. There was no intent in hitting him high. Even the announcers pointed that out. The receiver was leaning backward when hit. This rule needs a serious looking at.
The other glaring errors made by the lousy officials included the botched clock call at the end of regulation. Replay after replay showed 1 second remaining on the clock whether it was his knee down or he was out of bounds. The closest referee whistled the clock to stop. They were told that USC wanted a time out at the end of the play regardless of what Woods did. So USC should have been giving a field goal attempt. That is so common in football. The officials are told well ahead of the play that they want a time out when the play is dead.
Lastly was the holding penalty at the line of scrimmage against Stanford. Then they had 2nd and 7. They mis-marked the ball. How could you have a 10 yard penalty from the spot of the foul (near the line of scrimmage) and have 7 yards to go. It should have been 2nd and 15. Another glaring mistake by the officials.
Dude, I don’t think we are crazy. It was obvious he went for the head. Go back and look at the tape. It is also NOT the first time. Who are you kidding? We can’t help when the refs make lousy calls but we can control our own destiny by knowing the rules whether we agree with them or not and i do not agree with that rule. Let them play football and hit as hard as you want just do it right so it doesn’t cost you team a chance to win.
Looks like that $c dollar doesn’t stretch as much as it once did.  LOL.
Enjoy the rest of your probation.
problem is that TJ hit the rec with his shoulder pads, and had aimed low….the reviever fell back and down while TJ was in the air, he would have hit him in the mid section, but snce the reciever fell abck and down, it was a higher hit. should not have been called. Officiating was anti USC all night.
Wow SC we were very proud to be a Trojan on Saturday night.  You proved to everyone the media got it wrong!  Best game we have ever been to at SC.
Classic game and my hats off to the Trojans and the coaching staff…Only one problem. Why does T.J. McDonald, who I believe is a great player, have to always go for the “highlight hit” like Taylor Mays used to do. I really think that Mays career at USC was weakened and his stock in the NFL lessened because after that one year of “head hits” that made the highlight reels, he got it into his head that every tackle had to be the next highlight. Not only did this cost his team on many occasions but now T.J. seems to think that he has to follow in his footsteps.
When did we teach these guys to start tackling with their shoulder instead of wrapping their arms around the other guy to make sure you bring him down?
Sorry T.J. but I was not impressed by “the hit” and it probably cost your team “the game”!
That was an incredible game against Stanford.  All those banged-up young guys were nothing short of inspiring.  USC is once more on the verge of greatness.  Couple of things.  The line discipline was just about perfect but the coaches need to get a handle on those open-field breakdowns, like the taunting and the head-hunting by two players who really should know better by this time.  Those incidents cost us way too much.

Journalism can lead to many things. For some, it’s money. Some venture into the worlds of crime and government. Others tackle politics and entertainment (well, maybe that was already covered by crime and government). For Paul Kemp, journalism is the ticket to beaches, women, big business and copious amounts of alcohol.
Idealistic protagonist · Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp), a journalist at a failing newspaper in Puerto Rico, is tested by his corrupt surroundings. - Photo courtesy of FilmDistrict and GK Films
Set in 1960, The Rum Diary follows Kemp (Johnny Depp), a journalist who takes a job at a failing newspaper in Puerto Rico. Hounded by an extremely strong love of alcohol, Kemp finds himself drawn into the absurdities of expatriate life and the schemes of Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart), a businessman working on shady plans. To make matters worse, Sanderson’s girlfriend Chenault (Amber Heard) has an eye on Kemp.
The Rum Diary runs on the plot of Hunter S. Thompson’s novel, reflecting his early period as a journalist, before the fear and loathing set in. But don’t go in expecting a madcap bit of surrealism. This isn’t Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It’s a drunken exploration of the human condition, not a mescaline and LSD-fueled spin in the desert. It’s Thompson before he went completely Gonzo. Bruce Robinson, who adapted and directed the movie, expertly brings this world to life.
Robinson, the director of the classic tragic comedy Withnail & I, itself an alcohol-heavy character drama, imbues The Rum Diary with a seedy undertone. The film is a descent into human greed, under the veneer of glamor and tropical paradise, and every scene captures that duality, and Kemp’s growing unease at it all. The Americans, falling under the lead of Sanderson, aim to extort Puerto Rico for all the money they can squeeze out, all while living a swanky, 1960s lifestyle.
Depp is excellent as Kemp. Far less paranoid and neurotic than his Fear and Loathing portrayal of a Thompson stand-in, Depp brings an undertone of innocence and idealism to his character — ultimately challenged by the world around him — that is revealed in small touches throughout the film.
Whether dispensing wisdom through rum-induced voiceovers or trying to get his editor to accept more investigative work, Kemp is continuously engaging and philosophical, proving a steady keel for the film’s direction.
His coworkers at the newspaper more than make up for Depp’s relative sanity. Michael Rispoli plays Sala, a burnt-out, drunk photographer, equally jaded in his own den of iniquity. Richard Jenkins brings his usual charm and cynicism to the paper’s editor, struggling to appease the tourists and keep his drunken reporters in line.
But the real surprise among the supporting cast is Moburg (Giovanni Ribisi), a truly brain-fried reporter who spends his time listening to Hitler recordings and trying to create a 470-proof rum. As a comrade to Kemp, Ribisi’s journalist is unpredictable and never staid.
The Rum Diary, as with Thompson’s novel, critiques the situations it explores. Puerto Rico is a slum, with obese American tourists enjoying specialized areas while the businessmen profit. Sanderson and his cohorts are charming and enjoy their own paradise, but it’s clear they do not, and will never, fit in with the local population. Even Kemp’s lifestyle is subject to criticism, as he and Sala end up in worse situations as a result of their heavy drinking. The film lives off the duality of the island, and how it affects its residents.
Most surprising is how jaded the film is. Kemp and the audience enter the movie with an idealistic dream of the island and journalism, only to be undermined by human nature. Like his previous filmography, Robinson does an excellent job of balancing the story’s depressive elements with the funny, but the overall character arc for Kemp, despite its subdued nature, is still brutal.
The latest in adaptations of Thompson’s novels, the film is a strong, dour exploration into idealism and vice. Robinson and Depp bring out a sharp critique of greed and arrogance, all through the prism of sandy beaches and beautiful landscapes. It’s not a crazy movie — as the Thompson link would suggest — but it doesn’t need to be. The story and acting are compelling enough.
The Rum Diary is an alcohol-fueled tailspin toward a moment of cynical clarity. And it’s a brilliant ride. Thompson would be proud.

Is there a legume more controversial than the soybean? It’s been accused of being Monsanto’s evil, earth-killing, bio-tech child, an allergy trigger, an impediment to proper development in infants, a duplicitous pouch of carcinogens and an emasculating testosterone leech.
Japanese treat · For those squeamish about stinky, exotic dishes, Japanese natto provides a more subtle soybean experience. - Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
At the same time, soybeans are lauded as key to the longevity and slim characteristic of Asian cultures. Nutritionists claim soybeans are a perfect protein and calcium source, which at least partially explains why soybean products such as tofu and soymilk have infiltrated the United States’ markets with lofty nutritional claims of being healthier alternatives to meat and dairy.
These opposing allegations might draw never-ending debates, but, love them or hate them, soybeans are familiar commodities. Once considered a foreign ingredient of the exotic East, soy appears in just about any food now, from milk and cheese to bacon and Tofurky, even ice-cream and cupcakes. Most famously, soybeans are synonymous with tofu.
Maybe that’s why soy still connotes a substitute. It’s a tasteless, funky hippie fare, or the second-best option to the “real thing.”
Let’s get the truth out of the way first: Tofu is bland. It’s a pale, spongy chunk of gunk sitting in liquid in a plastic container. Tofu is a product of soybeans, and it’s usually eaten as a filler to meat, unlike the western tendency to eat it as a vegetarian substitute.
Elsewhere in the world, soybeans are enjoyed as intriguing fermented dishes, bursting with flavor and curious odors that haven’t taken global stage because they require a lot more bravado and a highly resistant nose.
The Korean stew cheonggukjang, the badass of miso soups, is one example.
Cheonggukjang is an earthy-red stew made from boiled soybeans left in warmth for days, interacting with air and bacteria until it gets digested into a pouch of nose-crushing stenches. The fermented soybean paste is simmered in broth, and chunks of tofu, onions and chili are added for extra heft.
As revolting as it sounds, this hearty Korean goulash is beloved by Koreans as a nutrient-rich “well-being” food. In Koreatown, lines are out the door even on a weekday afternoon at Olympic Cheonggukjang, one of Los Angeles’ most popular places for this stew. Walk barely past the door and you’ll realize you’ve walked into a stink dungeon, but you’ll also be greeted by enthusiastic customers digging into the thick flavorful sludge and an array of other stinky fermented side dishes like kimchi.
Originally, soybeans were consumed only after decomposition, as raw soybeans are toxic to humans. Fermentation helped to break down some of the indigestible sugars and acids.
Yes, fermentation stinks. But the process also builds up many flavors — complex dimensions of tastes and odors that smack full of umami, the inexplicable savory fifth taste sense that intimates comfort and satisfaction.
If you’re still squeamish about the pungent smell, start with the Japanese natto, whole soybeans fermented with specific bacteria until slimy and gooey. Natto is typically served for breakfast, either on top of steamed rice or as a side dish, with a dollop of soy sauce and mustard or stirred with raw egg and scallions.
Its nutty, salty flavor isn’t as intense as the Korean stew’s; it’s the viscous texture that gets you. As you pull apart a bean with your chopsticks, you’ll see a sticky, syrupy substance that’s pulled apart from the rest of the pile — that’s the fermentation.
Most home-style Japanese restaurants and Japanese markets in Los Angeles offer natto. Fukugawa in Gardena serves traditional Japanese breakfast sets that include natto, rice, grilled fish, tamagoyaki (rolled sweet omelet) and miso soup. Some places, such as Mid-city’s Sushi Roku and Sake House Miro, also sneak natto into an innocent sushi roll.
Sushi rolls aren’t the only fun way to eat soybeans though. Having tofu deep-fried is another option; just about anything in the world tastes fabulous when dunked in sizzling oil and fried to a crisp. “Chou doufu” (literally, “stinky tofu”) is a popular delicacy in Taiwan, where stalls line up in night markets and stink up the whole area with the tofu’s pungent smells.
Lee’s Garden in Alhambra is a good place to acquaint yourself with stinky tofu that is authentic but sensibly tamer than the street version. The stench, more like a whiff than a wallop, isn’t as powerful. If you can get past the smell, stinky tofu is actually quite pleasant with its crispy, golden exterior and spongy, custardy insides.  The taste is surprisingly mellow and reminiscent of tangy low-fat cream cheese.
If you’ve built up your tolerance and want something more potent, try the hotpot version of stinky tofu. 101 Hot Pot Café in San Gabriel Valley has a decent hot pot stinky tofu — as good as a hellish, fermented brew can get, anyway. There’s no guarantee you’ll enjoy it, but there’s no question the stink and taste will stay etched in your mind for a long time.

No reason for debating the health benefits of soy.  Stick with non-GMO products and you have thousands of years of use on your side.  If that is not enough, you can look into the scientific research surrounding soy and you will find proof that soy will not make men grow breasts or cause cancer.  However. if you are lazy in your research you will most likely find the pseudo research propagated by the Weston Price Foundation, a group funded by the dairy industry.  Hmmm, I wonder why their research says so is bad….follow the money and look for real science.  Do not just take the top hit.

If you enjoy speaking to complete strangers, dancing like a madman and wearing eccentric and enigmatic costumes, HARD Haunted Mansion at the Shrine Auditorium was the place for you. As one of the most anticipated and best-known electronic dance music events of Halloween weekend, HARD, an event where nearly anything went, took place Friday and Saturday.
Laura Cueva | Daily Trojan
Friday 
Friday night’s headliners attracted the crowd with the skills of some venerable electronic music artists.
Each act added its own flavor to the Shrine, but the best indicator of a good performance was the crowd’s energy.
When Laidback Luke took the HARD stage, he managed to amp up the audience, throwing out crowd favorites and receiving shouts and wild dancing in return.
His remixes of various popular songs, such as Avicii’s “Levels,” Michael Jackson’s classic “Thriller” and Alice Deejay’s “Better Off Alone,” showcased the best moments in the songs while throwing in some ground-shaking, body-quaking dubstep beats and tinny, fast-tempoed electronic sounds. Luke also showcased his own works with tracks such as “Turbulence,” which sound even better live.
The set lulled at times, but Luke understood his audience’s needs, focusing on beats long enough to get everyone grooving, but not so long that they got bored.
Fans were in for a treat once Fatboy Slim hit the stage. The electronic music veteran first sat cross-legged with a Guy Fawkes mask, mischievously rubbing his hands together, while mind-boggling images flickered behind him. Slim was in the Halloween spirit, with yellow face-paint in the style of the Joker and a stellar use of visual effects.
Throughout the set, Slim showed off his experience, especially when he blasted a remix of his 2001 track “Ya Mama” that was impressively complex and fast-paced. His remix of Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” didn’t have the best payoff, but his rendition of LMFAO’s “I’m in L.A. Bitch,” was exciting and aggressive, with a smattering of sounds that made good use of the repeated lines. The 75-minute set featured an excited Slim pushing the tempo and showing how he got his name in the electronic music world.
Rusko’s set was not able to top Slim’s act. Though some of the deep dubstep sounds did get the crowd riled up, most of the tracks had trouble holding a stable rhythm or beat. The tracks felt amateur in their setup, with too much happening at the same time. What’s more, the stage only featured lit-up letters that spelled out “Rusko,” failing to take advantage of the visual space to wow the crowd and add to the musical experience.
Saturday
The banana costumes, glitter, glow sticks, furry boots and the dancing nun with a “Jesus Raves” sign ramped up Saturday night, maintaining the mayhem and madness of the night before.
Smaller acts, such as Oliver, Jackmaster, Goose and The Magician, warmed up the two stages for larger acts, including Fake Blood, Paul Chambers, Skrillex, Major Lazer, Skream & Benga and Soulwax — the perfect setup for a wonderfully eclectic and energized evening of sound.
Especially noteworthy was Fake Blood, who played with the audience’s rhythmic and stylistic expectations as he created massive musical climaxes that integrated an assortment of samples from other works while transitioning with ease between each base-thumping beat.
Fake Blood’s remix of his own “I Think I Like It” energized the crowd both by its notoriety and the accompanying remixed video, creating a total sensory experience that would make the slim percentage of non-intoxicated audience members feel as if they were experiencing complete euphoria.
The infamous Skrillex kept the energy going as he opened with deep, slow yet dynamic beats in typical Skrillex fashion — dubstep at its finest. The mix-master included tracks from the likes of La Roux and even went for a throwback reference with the one and only Notorious B.I.G.
Periodically, Skrillex mixed in his infamous “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites,” which served as a crowd pleaser. While Skrillex’s set kept the crowd going, there was a certain air of predictability: Progressively build up the tension, drop it with huge booming beats and repeat. The ecstatic crowd was pleased nonetheless.
Major Lazer, in contrast, became the highlight with its dynamism and diverse style. The duo, Diplo and Switch, was pure energy and charisma with its enticing assortment of dubstep, reggae and energetic remixes of Swedish House Mafia’s “One Killabit Dubstep,” Benny Benassi’s “Satisfaction” and Ray Parker Jr.’s “Ghostbusters,” to name a few.
Though there were moments that lacked this specific zest, when Major Lazer was on, it was on fire. “Jump Up” had the entire crowd on its feet, leaping in mid-air and “Bruk Out” created chaos with its rapid rhythm and contagious vivacity.
Words can hardly describe the mayhem of HARD Haunted Mansion. Here’s looking to Halloween 2012.

USC will go head to head with UCLA in this semester’s edition of mtvU’s “Student Bodies.” The competition will be aired in a series of installments starting Oct. 31 on mtvU and mtvU.com. The winning team of the competition will earn an all-expenses-paid trip to mtvU’s Spring Break 2012, held in Las Vegas.
Two participants from each school will act as a team to increase their fitness levels in competitions over the course of six weeks. Celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson, creator of the “Core Secrets” home fitness workout, will oversee each participant and aid them in achieving their goals. Previous seasons of “Student Bodies” comprise three episodes, each around seven minutes in length, covering the competition.
The show brands itself as a new way to “take [your] fitness up a notch,” and casting calls asked for students who needed extra help in reaching their fitness goals, whether that was completing a “marathon, physical competition, or looking to win the intramural league championship.”
Previously, the show pitted two teams of two from the same school against one another to compete for a Spring Break trip, meaning this rivalry showing of USC against UCLA is new.
MTV advertises its casting calls on its website and on the mtvU channels. For more information tune in to mtvU tomorrow to watch the premiere of “Student Bodies: USC v. UCLA.”
Any way that you can engage young adults in fitness had to be saluted.  Well done MTV, UCS and UCLA, I hope the programme is a great success

Tim Gunn added unique charm to his style, with his sharp yet classic pinstriped suit with an unexpectedly violet tie and handkerchief, and his speech, through the use of colorful anecdotes, when he spoke in Bovard Auditorium on Friday night.

The Chief Creative Officer of Liz Claiborne Inc., perhaps best known for his role as a host and designer mentor on Project Runway, addressed a nearly packed room as though he were talking to friends, speaking openly and frankly.
Though Gunn was an engaging, entertaining and enthusiastic speaker, he shone most during the question and answer session that followed his speech. USC students, staff and parents, as well as other Angelenos, asked a variety of questions that ranged from being introspective and insightful to being individual and clearly tailored to the asker.
Each of Gunn’s responses was genuine and honest, as he often asked the inquirers questions about themselves, briefly conversing with them.
Once prompted, he also spoke candidly about behind-the-scenes drama on Project Runway’s eight season, when he made a comment about a decision to cut a designer coming from “those crack-smoking judges” to the Los Angeles Times.
Gunn said judge and co-host Heidi Klum approached him at the finale taping and told him she was upset by his comment. During deliberation, judge Michael Kors convinced fellow judge Nina Garcia and decided to award the final prize to Gretchen Jones, the winner, though Klum and Garcia had wanted to award the prize to Mondo Guerra, who won the most individual challenges that season.
Gunn said Klum sought him out during taping, when he was sitting behind cameras in the “literal and metaphorical dark” to tell him about the situation and ask him if she was no longer smoking crack.
“Yes, I told her, you’re no longer a crack-smoker,” Gunn said. “But you’ve passed the pipe to Michael and Nina.”
With that kind of wit and charm, he was able to make his speech engaging as well. Much of its subject matter was already made public in his new book, Gunn’s Golden Rules.

Gunn, who served as administration and faculty at the Parsons School of Design for 24 years, said he wrote the book as though he was talking to a student in his office. Though the information was repeated, Gunn’s delivery was not pedagogic.
He said he was “troubled” by the amount of entitled students and people he has increasingly encountered, but softened his strong message with well-timed delivery. When Gunn illustrated the situation with a story about a student who asked for a recommendation after acting egomaniacally, he recalled precise words.
“Jeff, I would recommend you to walk a dog around the block,” he said.
Gunn’s storytelling ability, not often seen on the small screen, stood out as he spoke. He discussed some of the “ridiculous behavior” he has seen from those in the fashion world, such as an encounter with Vogue Editor-at-Large Andre Leon Talley when Gunn was hosting a panel discussion at the New York Public Library.
“He was reclining on a sofa with a translucent barber bibs, with his arms out as though he had stigmata,” Gunn said. “He was being fed cubes of cheese and grapes.”
He also gave some fashion advice by highlighting the subject matter in a chapter of his book, Don’t Lose Your Sense of Smell. He said the title came from the monkey house at a zoo, which smells horrible to all upon entrance, but becomes bearable as time goes on.
Gunn said this applies to fashion sense perfectly.
“If your visceral response is such that you think ‘I can’t possibly wear this,’ listen to your gut,” he said. “Your gut won’t betray you.”
He also said, though he is a public figure with fashion expertise, he tries to reserve judgment when people ask him what he thinks of their look.
“The person out there dressed like a circus clown, might just be a circus clown,” he said.
He said his common response is to tell people, “If that’s the look you wanted, you sure have a good one.”
Gunn’s slightly sassy, humble and always charming on-screen persona proved to be genuine as he spoke with gusto and affection. Both his speech and responses fit the evening appropriately, like a well-tailored suit.

Intersection in need of increased safety measures
Will it take a critical injury, or worse — a death — before the City of Los Angeles recognizes the atrocious state of the junction where Portland Street meets Adams Boulevard? This intersection, just one block north of The Row, has some of the worst pedestrian crossing signage in the USC area, filling local residents with fear as cars consistently fail to stop for pedestrians patiently waiting to cross the road.
Drivers, however, are not entirely to blame for failing to yield to pedestrians. The flashing warning lights there are located out of driver’s eye lines, hang high above the street and are hidden by voluminous trees. Drivers often fail to see these lights, impairing their ability to see pedestrians. As a result, pedestrians tend to walk onto the road, using hand signals to indicate their need to cross the busy street. Pedestrians shouldn’t have to risk their safety like this just to cross a road.
With the rising number of students living in University Park, it is imperative that the city act now to increase pedestrian visibility at this dangerous intersection. The lights above the street must be lowered to the driver’s eye level so they can more clearly see warning signs that indicate pedestrians wish to cross the street. In addition to this minor adjustment, in-roadway flashing lights must be installed into the asphalt along the crossing so that drivers have yet another, and more direct, warning signal to yield to pedestrians.
Los Angeles must invest money now to fulfill this simple request. According to the Los Angeles Department of Transportation’s annual report for the 2010 to 2011 fiscal year, LADOT plans to put $15 million from Measure R revenue into pedestrian safety programs in the next five years, not to mention the additional $287.2 million promised for traffic funding over the next 30 years through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Long Range Transportation Plan. In addition to these funds, LADOT has access to the State of California’s $25 billion portion of grant money provided through the Economic Recovery and Restoration Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2009. Money is clearly not a problem for LADOT and any cost is inconsequential in comparison to the tragedy that would arise if anyone were to be injured or killed at this dangerous intersection.
Luckily, there have not yet been any reports of injuries or deaths at this junction. Still, the city must recognize the danger that awaits pedestrians at this intersection and act now to lower the current warning lights to the driver’s eye level and to install in-roadway lights along the crosswalk. Reforming this intersection now will encourage drivers to slow down and allow pedestrians to cross the street in a safe and confident manner.

Actually, an ‘SC student has already been killed at that crosswalk… and the only upgrades the crosswalk received were the out-of-sight flashing lights you mention:

Last week, I got an email from James Kvaal, President Barack Obama’s campaign policy director.
“President Obama just took two serious steps to make life a lot easier for folks with student loans,” the email said. “These changes will make a real difference in helping millions of Americans get by month to month.”
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
But is the change as drastic as Kvaal and the rest of the Obama administration make it out to be?
Obama rolled out “Pay As You Earn,” the administration’s new student loan relief program, last week. The program aims to relieve student debt by lowering the maximum required payment on student loans from 15 to 10 percent of discretionary income and by forgiving debt after 20 years instead of the previous 25.
At first glance, the plan seems like a great solution to many of the nation’s educational problems.
More than 1 million students could take advantage of the lower monthly payments, and more than 6 million could take advantage of the loan consolidations.
Kvaal said it would fast-track student debt relief by moving the previous target date for relief of 2014 to next year.
Critics say Obama is making a mistake by surpassing Congress to accomplish this. Others laud him for making a smart political move. Students who desperately need debt relief are lost in the politics.
Kvaal and Obama are careful not to say that the plan neglects students struggling to pay off private debt. And these are some of the students who need the most help.
Private loans are much more difficult to pay off than federal loans. They have fewer protections, more variable interest rates and often cost more to the borrower. Not to mention, bankruptcy reform passed in 2004 doesn’t allow students with private student debt to declare bankruptcy.
More than $100 billion in federal education loans and $10 billion in private student loans are originated each year according to FinAid.org. Though federal education loans represent a  larger portion of the debt, those students in the private sector must be protected too. They are trying to earn an education as well and if overarching debt reform is to be effective, all students must benefit.
They’re all stuck with this debt. Pay As You Earn neglects students with this problem, which points to the program as more of a political move than a push for genuine educational debt reform.
It’s a good thing Obama is responding to such a critical issue. But, Pay As You Earn has overlooked some students and stimulated political policy debate rather than a discussion on higher education.
The program is a step in the right direction. The politically dominated discussion distracts and prevents Pay As You Earn from functioning as a true solution to such a critical issue, with many analyzing it as a political move in anticipation of next year’s election.
Students are first and foremost students, not voters. Obama should revise Pay As You Earn with this in mind to include all students weighed down with debt.

Why does the author seem to think that students deserve the right to be “protected” from loans?  A loan is when you borrow money, and then have to PAY IT BACK.
Obama to make student loans 'pay as you earn'…

In the last week, South Korean smartphone subscriptions have surpassed 20 million.
As smartphones become an integral part of more and more peoples lives, the competition within the smartphone market has become increasingly intense, as competitors such as Samsung and Apple fight for dominance.
This figure, however, does not necessarily reflect if Samsung actually surpassed Apple in smartphones sale. While Samsung shipped more phones to warehouses during this period, it is not clear that more Samsung phones were actually sold.
Apple does report sales numbers regarding its iPhones, while Samsung will not openly disclose sales figures. Therefore, it is difficult to make any statement with certainty regarding which company holds a stronger position in the smartphone market.
Though Samsung and Apple are competitors, Apple continues to use many Samsung components in its iPhone and iPad products. In 2010, Apple spent nearly $5.7 billion on Samsung parts. Apple is currently trying to move away from using Samsung components, but the company still continues to much Samsung-manufactured hardware.
Samsung produces significantly more smartphones than Apple – selling phones that run Google’s Android operating system as well as phones that run Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system. Apple, in contrast, only offers a few varieties of its iPhone.
Samsung and Apple have been engaging in a number of conflicts regarding patents in the past months. These patent wars have been fought on a global scale – in Europe, Asia, Australia, and the U.S., with each company accusing the other of using its patented mobile phone technologies. In Korea, Samsung has expressed efforts to The Korea Times about its plans to block the iPhone 5 from Korean markets.

The set-up: After losing to Stanford last year on the road in Palo Alto, the Trojans aimed to knock off the No. 4 ranked Cardinal on their home turf. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum served as the host site of ESPN’s College Game Day and added to the anticipation of the matchup between the two ranked teams. After knocking off Notre Dame a week ago, some believed USC had the confidence to upset one of the best teams in the country.
The story: The Trojans did not go down without an intense fight. After three overtime periods, the Stanford Cardinal defeated the USC Trojans 56-48 in the first overtime game between the two schools.
Stanford struck first with a touchdown on its opening drive. Heisman frontrunner quarterback Andrew Luck threw a 10-yard pass to Tyler Gaffney. After stalling on its first drive and recording a stop, USC answered back with a 22-yard field goal by kicker Andre Heidari before the conclusion of the first quarter to make the score 7-3.
In the second quarter, the USC defense performed extremely well, and Stanford only managed a 33-yard field goal by kicker Eric Whitaker. Before the conclusion of the first half, Andre Heidari made a career-long 50-yard field goal, helping the Trojans to only trail 10-6 heading into halftime.
At the beginning of the third quarter the Trojans scored their first touchdown of the game. A 61-yard run by USC tailback Curtis McNeal gave the Trojans the lead for the first time in the game. McNeal once again fueled the lead for the Trojans by breaking off a 25-yard touchdown run.
Trailing 20-10 midway through the third quarter, the Cardinal leaned on Andrew Luck to lead them down the field. The drive resulted in a five-yard touchdown pass to Ryan Hewitt. Before the conclusion of the third quarter, Luck jumped in to the end zone for a two-yard touchdown run giving Stanford a 24-20 lead.
USC regained the lead once more following a 28-yard touchdown pass from Matt Barkley to Marqise Lee on a slant route. The Cardinal responded yet again on a 29-yard field goal by Eric Whitaker with five minutes left in regulation. USC was forced to punt on the ensuing possession, and Stanford took over in their own territory with a chance to take the lead.
However, Nickell Robey jumped a route and took the interception 33 yards to give the Trojans a 34-27 lead with over 3 minutes to play. However, Luck once again led the Cardinal down the field resulting in a two-yard touchdown run by running back Stepfan Taylor. USC tried to set up a field goal in the final seconds, but Robert Woods failed to fall to the ground before time expired. Tied at 34, Stanford and USC headed to overtime.
The back and forth scoring continued in overtime. Stanford was the first to strike with a one-yard run by tailback Jeremy Stewart. USC tied up the game again following a 15-yard pass from Matt Barkley to wide receiver Robert Woods. Tied at 48, the game was extended into a second overtime.
Receiving the ball first, the Trojans scored after a 12-yard pass from Barkley to Randall Telfer. The game was tied once again after an 11-yard touchdown pass from Andrew Luck to Levine Toilolo. The Trojans and Cardinal were going into a third overtime after a tie remained at 48.
Stanford scored after a five-yard touchdown run by Stepfan Taylor and converted their attempt for two points on a Luck pass to Coby Fleener. Knocking on the door at the four yard line, the Trojans hoped to punch it in. However, Curtis McNeal fumbled the ball in to the end zone and Stanford recovered to seal the victory and keep their hopes of a national championship alive.
Up next: USC will travel to Boulder, Colo., to face Pac-12 south opponent Colorado on Friday, November 4 at 6:00 pm PDT. The Buffalos are 1-8 overall and 0-5 in conference play.

Scientists from USC, in collaboration with researchers from Sweden’s Uppsala University, have decoded the Copiale Cipher, the university announced Oct. 25. The document is an 18th Century German manuscript comprising 75,000 characters in 105 pages. It details rituals performed by one of the many secret societies that flourished in the country in the 1700s.
Research Professor Kevin Knight of the Information Sciences Institute, a member of the team, said in a statement released to the Associated Press, “This opens up a window for people who study the history of ideas and the history of secret societies. Historians believe that secret societies have had a role in revolutions, but all that is yet to be worked out, and a big part of the reason is because so many documents are enciphered.”
The research team covered a total of 80 languages in its attempts to decipher the code, having started with the idea that the code lay in the Roman letters between the symbols. However, the members were finally able to find out that the abstract symbols were actually the key to the code. The research team combined high speed computation with their cerebral powers to successfully break the code.
Dr. Knight told the Los Angeles Times, “I defeated their security! For me, the fun is in cracking the code. It has passed through a lot of hands, but you persevered and could read what other people couldn’t.”

A Nebraska mother and her three roommates accused of keeping children in a dog cage attended a hearing Oct. 27.
Police discovered four children in a wire kennel at their trailer. Police Lieutenant Rich Hoaglund said in a statement that the metal kennel was secured by a wire tie with a mattress and animal feces inside.
According to CNN, the suspects were identified by police as Bryson L. Eyten, 25; Samantha J. Eyten, 24; Ashly A. Clark, 22; and Lacy J. Beyer, 20. They are charged with felony child abuse, first degree false imprisonment and misdemeanor child abuse. The suspects were arrested Mnday after police received an anonymous request to check on the welfare of the children in North Platte, Nebraska.
Clark, the children’s mother, told officials that she kept the boys in the kennel at night to prevent them from climbing out of the trailer’s window. The Eytens and their 8-year-old and 8-month-old children also lived with Clark, but these children were not kept in kennels. However due to the filthy conditions of the trailer, all four children were placed with state authorities.
Authorities said the suspects were arraigned Tuesday afternoon and jailed on a $50,000 bond each. Their next court appearance is scheduled for Nov. 10.

On most nights, sophomore guard Maurice Jones’ age would have prevented him from entering the Conga Room at L.A. Live.
Yet on Friday afternoon, Jones, the youngest player and only sophomore chosen to represent his team at the annual Pac-12 Conference Men’s Basketball Media Day, found himself sitting on the stage at the popular nightclub alongside USC coach Kevin O’Neill.
“[Jones] has to lead,” O’Neill said. “That is a hard thing to do for a guy that is just starting his sophomore year.”
As one of only two returning players that scored a point for the Trojans last season, Jones will be counted on for more than just leadership.
Last season, Jones mostly played shooting guard. When senior guard Jio Fontan suffered an ACL tear during an exhibition game this summer in Brazil that could sideline him the entire season, however, O’Neill announced that Jones would play point guard. Nevertheless, O’Neill stressed that Jones will be counted on to score, in addition to distributing the ball.
“[Jones] has to be in attack mode all the time,” O’Neill said. “He has got to be prepared to play 40 minutes a game.”
Jones said that he has twisted his ankle three times in the last three weeks. Besides Jones, the Trojans only have three available guards on scholarship, and none have competed at the Division 1 level.
“If we do not have [Jones], it will be difficult for us to be competitive in major college games,” O’Neill said. “Do not come to the games, it would be ugly.”
Jones has not let his ankle injury slow him down.
“I do not take it lightly,” Jones said. “I still have to give one-hundred percent while I am out there.”
The Trojans were picked to finish seventh in the Pac-12 Men’s Basketball Media Poll.
“We are a work in progress right now,” O’Neill said. “Sometimes we look good and some days we stink.”
