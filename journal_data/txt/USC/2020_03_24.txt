It was about 15 years ago, to the month, that my house burned down. It was Palm Sunday and I was immunocompromised. It was the tail-end of the SARS epidemic. My entire family was at church. I was the only one home.
While I sit here and write this, confined to the top floor of my apartment building, I can’t help but think about the panic I felt that day. I can’t help but think about how trapped I felt, and how, to some extent, I am trapped now.
Then I relax my shoulders a little bit. I have to remind myself that I am not six years old anymore and that I am out of harm’s way. It used to take a lot to get me down off of that ladder — the one where I let my post-traumatic stress overtake me mentally, emotionally and even, the hardest to control, physically. Although now that I’ve gone to therapy and more time has passed since that day, I have gained more perspective; I know I am safe.
In a time when we are experiencing a pandemic — a deadly strain of coronavirus has overtaken the world — we must practice empathy more than ever before. We must ease our own personal anxieties the best way we know how, while also trying to understand the impact this virus has on our neighbors. We must realize that many who are truly struggling stay silent, but we still must not be ignorant to their pain. Context and perspective go a long way during a time like this.
With that said, there’s a reason why literally everyone in the world feels so anxious — just look to my story. Everyone has their own chronicle of havoc, whether it be that of a Baby Boomer’s generational trauma from World War II, a Gen Xer’s battle with conspiracy theories, a millennial’s plight from the housing crisis of 2008 or general stories that hit closer to home, like mine. Only a select few are coming out of this pandemic completely composed and there is a sense of solidarity in that.
Anxiety and fear are contagious, and there is little to do as humans to escape those feelings. This is a period in time where we lack control, and that fact alone is scary. Yet, we must remember that this time is transient. It’s not going to last forever and a sense of normalcy will return. There is an end in sight, just as there was with every other catastrophe. As a world, as human beings, we will learn from this.
For the time being, most of us are isolated to our homes, and for some of us this is an easy request. For others, it may mean re-entering a toxic household or a blunt to finances. Recognizing this disparity is key but does not dismiss any other suffering — this should only elicit more compassion and care. All of us are down but we still have the ability to lift each other up, even from afar.
Because of this, there’s no easy solution to stress and anxiety caused by social distancing. I could easily recommend taking up a new hobby, cooking more, working out, checking up on friends and family, practicing acts of self-care and self-reflection, but while these are productive and healthy tasks, they are Band-Aid solutions to a much more daunting issue. Education concerning the importance of social distancing is imperative in order to ease the stir-crazy effects staying inside can induce. We are all part of a larger effort to protect the public health and there is some unity in our solitude to find in that. 
When my family was suffering, my community in a tiny New York town swiftly gathered around us to lessen our burden. My neighbors housed us for nearly a month, family friends brought us clothes and general living supplies, and most importantly, provided us with emotional support. My community lifted my family in ways that astound and humble me to this day. In the past few weeks, I’ve been looking to model their behavior as someone who has been fortunate enough to have a safe place to seclude in.
The best way to combat this virus is to listen to public health officials working around the clock to find the best solution to COVID-19 and ease its devastation. As a community, the best way we can combat this virus is doing our civic duty by staying inside and by lending a hand in anyway we know how. It can be as simple as joining a Facebook group that aims to help those severely disadvantaged during this crisis or be as complex as spearheading policy change. There is no limit to what can be accomplished during this time.
Resorting to bigotry, racism or egotism out of a fear of the unknown is injurious to our journey back to good public health — no person is immune to this virus. This is an unprecedented time when questions are boundless and answers are limited, when milestones that cannot be replicated are being taken away from us, when people are dying rapidly from a malignant virus. We must stick together as human beings now more than ever. Remember, there is an intangible amount of comfort in solidarity.

Since classes have moved online for the rest of the semester, there is an unprecedented temptation for students to press “snooze” on their alarms while simultaneously pressing “record” on their lectures. Now, students can wake up a minute before their lecture without being late to class, all while listening to their professors from the comfort of their own bed. 
Although these options may allow students to sleep slightly longer, waking up right before lecture or staying in bed all day sleeping are not conducive to one’s ability to learn or maintain their mental health. Instead, students should try to maintain a schedule throughout the day for both health and academic performance.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends maintaining regular routines despite school closures. Falling back on routines from school brings a sense of much-needed normalcy during a time of uncertainty and disruption. Students should still partake in their morning routine of waking up, getting dressed and having breakfast before logging onto their class. Getting out of bed wakes students up and puts them in an academic mindset before beginning class.  
On campus, students may bike from one class to another, skate across campus to buy food or walk to their favorite place to study. Movement in some form is an integral part of a college student’s day. Although this kind of movement cannot be replicated perfectly at home, it is still important for students to continue to move in some capacity, multiple times per day. Motion can translate to an at-home workout or a quick walk outside during the gaps between classes.
To replicate the movement from one class to the next, students can move to new places in their houses for each class. This breaks up long, monotonous sessions in front of the computer and can help students break up the day based on their classes
Living in close quarters on campus made it easy to see and connect with friends on a daily basis. For many, seeing friends and talking over dinner was a highlight of their daily routines. Social distancing and the varied location of students across the globe certainly make daily interaction more difficult, but not impossible. 
During this past semester, if two students consistently met up to eat lunch together, they should simply use video chat with one another in place of their regularly scheduled lunches. Staying connected with others despite changing circumstances is extremely important for mental health.  
In the evening, connect with friends from a club that would normally hold a meeting at that time. Conduct study sessions with classmates and continue to have movie nights with friends over Zoom. Just because face-to-face meetings are no longer possible does not mean the interactions between students have to stop. It only means students may need to work harder to find ways to consistently connect, to avoid falling into feelings of isolation and depression.
Granted, not all students have access to the same resources. Some may find it more difficult than others to maintain school routines from home. However, students should prioritize incorporating movement and social interaction into their daily schedule to the best of their ability, whenever possible.
Before the outbreak of the coronavirus, students did not give all the different aspects of their routines a second thought. However, now students are more aware than ever before of what they no longer have. Attempting to identify the parts of a routine makes it easier to copy it, which in the long run will be beneficial for both mental health and academic performance.  
Without a doubt, sitting home alone listening to classes on Zoom does not come close to replacing life on campus. But, the first step to bringing back a sense of normalcy for students, and thereby getting through this unprecedented time, is for students to maintain a similar schedule to school while completing online classes to the best of their abilities.

OK, so everything is just flat out weird right now. We’re all stuck at home, (or at least we should be) with a huge amount of free time suddenly on our hands. Odds are, you’re probably looking for some new stuff to watch. And lucky for you, the Daily Trojan has got you covered with some essential Los Angeles-based media. 
Whether you’ve left the city to wait out the coronavirus in your hometown, or you’re still hanging out by campus just stuck inside your apartment, you’re probably craving some semblance of normalcy. You may be wishing that you could be adventuring through L.A. again. Or (especially if you’ve left) at least just be back among the vibrant city’s vibes. 
The cool thing about going to USC is we live in the birthplace of American entertainment. Naturally, a lot of content produced in Hollywood will take place in L.A., but some of these films and TV shows will be centered around the city as more than just a neutral backdrop — L.A. is almost presented as its own character. So if you’re missing your second home or even your home home, check these classics out!
“Chinatown” — Hulu 
OK, Roman Polanski is not a person we should be celebrating, let’s get that out of the way. That being said, he has given us an acclaimed body of work, one that includes the 1974 widely-regarded masterpiece, “Chinatown.” Set in 1937, “Chinatown” is a nostalgic neo-noir mystery thriller starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Jake Gittes (Nicholson) is a private investigator hired by a woman named Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway) to follow her husband. But he soon learns that this is more than just a case of a broken marriage and an unfaithful husband. The movie is simultaneously a whirlwind of drama, an edge-of-your-seat mystery and a riveting psychological thriller. “Chinatown” is a dark portrait of the early days of L.A. and reminiscent of the dominant styles of filmmaking of the era.
“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” — YouTube (rent for $5.99) 
You’ve definitely heard of this one. “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” was nominated for 10 Academy Awards this year and took home Best Production Design and Best Supporting Actor for Brad Pitt’s suave performance as stuntman Cliff Booth. Quentin Tarantino’s latest film follows several storylines in 1969 Los Angeles, and finishes off in climactic final act. If you can sit through the two-and-a-half hour run time, it’s well worth it. 
The movie paints a campy portrait of the ’60s through the lives of a colorful film star Rick Dalton (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and his stunt double Cliff Booth (played by Brad Pitt). You are transported to an entirely different time as scenes emphasize a vintage L.A. and the revelatory aesthetics of counterculture. The movie didn’t win Best Production Design for no reason. “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” is a must-watch for anyone who likes a bit of late 20th century nostalgia and is a bit of a Hollywood buff. 
“La La Land” — Amazon Prime (rent for $2.99) 
This one’s in the present day! And it’s an absolute delight of a picture. Damian Chazelle’s Oscar-winning film “La La Land” is a dreamy story of modern day Los Angeles and two young artists who stumble into each other’s lives and fall madly in love. The color palette is riddled with pastel pinks, blues, yellows and purples and the soundtrack is a whimsical mix of piano ballads and uptempo jazz numbers. Chazelle takes us all over the city, from the lengths of the Santa Monica Pier to the heights of the Griffith Observatory. And hardcore Angelenos will recognize some of the more obscure locations like Angels Flight Railway and the Lighthouse Cafe.
It’s a movie for those who like a challenging romance and formalist cinema. Fantasy-sequences are smoothly rolled into a realistic portrait of being a fresh-faced struggling hopeful in the City of Stars, the city where dreams come true. It’s a movie that’s obsessed with the movies. And Hollywood loves nothing more than itself, so you can trust in its escapism.
“Blade Runner” — Netflix
Finally! A movie that doesn’t refer to L.A. in the title! “Blade Runner” is set in 2019, but the film came out in 1982. Why it thinks we could have been that technologically advanced by now beats me, but it’s an electrifying thriller that takes place in a futuristic dystopian version of Los Angeles where synthetic humans are bioengineered for the sole purpose of labor. 
The story is that of a gritty former cop who is tasked with hunting down a group of fugitive replicants. “Blade Runner” has some of the most magnificent cinematography of ’80s sci-fi thrillers, depicting imaginative and incredibly thorough worldbuilding. It’s not one that will comfort you if you miss L.A. per se, rather it’ll get you re-imagining it.
“BoJack Horseman” — Netflix
Netflix’s critically acclaimed original series “BoJack Horseman” is a modern classic and has cemented itself as a cornerstone in adult animated television through its mature themes and the nuances of its intricately clever world. If you have a high tolerance for anti-heroes, a perfect way to spend the quarantine might be getting invested in BoJack Horseman, a washed up celebrity struggling with, well, being an all around terrible guy, or rather, horse. 
The show takes place in a world where humans and animals coexist. BoJack, in six seasons, goes through an incredibly raw and human character arc. The show’s message stays consistent: Growth is nonlinear. The series plays up the drama and grit of everything he does and goes through, and it gets away with it by being a “fun cartoon” at first glance. “BoJack Horseman’s” parody of L.A. is especially colorful and unique and plays into many stereotypical Hollywood character archetypes and plotlines.
“Barry” — HBO
To cap off our list is a second eponymous anti-hero-centered TV show. This one’s a little more violent and a little less colorful, but just as fun. HBO’s “Barry” has only had two seasons but has already received immense recognition and acclaim with 30 Emmy nominations, including two Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series wins for Bill Hader. Hader plays a hitman from Ohio who, for his most recent assignment, is hired to take someone out in L.A. But he ends up staying when he accidentally stumbles into an acting class and discovers a new love and talent he never knew he had. 
With an absurd plot that makes way for some truly hilarious scenes and characters, “Barry” is a show that definitely leaves a mark on the viewer. A huge part of this is because Barry  draws deep sympathy from the audience while revealing very little about himself or his past. The show is not so much about Los Angeles as it is about its magical ability to inspire artistic passion in almost anyone.

If the past two weeks haven’t been a series of unfortunate events, then I really don’t know what is.
As evident by the emails rolling in from the Office of the Provost, USC Housing, professors and club presidents, the second semester of my first year here at USC has taken a 180 degree turn. From moving out most of my belongings from my dorm room to canceling my flight to New York (goodbye Spring Break 2020), my anxiety has slowly begun to swallow me whole. What seemed distant and unconcerning to me and my fellow Trojans became a prevailing obstacle to the whole country. Named a pandemic by the World Health Organization, the coronavirus has become an international crisis affecting millions. 
Since my last article for this column was published, not once did I imagine that I would write this latest piece at the desk in my childhood home drinking a homemade iced matcha latte. But after Billie Eilish announced she’s postponing her tour and the NBA suspended its 2020 season, here we are right? All that’s happened these past few weeks just goes to show how fast circumstances can change. And despite how scary that might be, it’s OK. We will tackle whatever comes our way, just like the Baudelaire children did in “A Series of Unfortunate Events.” 
Lemony Snicket’s 13 novels follow the tragic tales of the three orphaned Baudelaire children Violet, Klaus and Sunny. Though they aren’t challenged by the onset of a deadly virus, they instead must grapple with their parents’ sudden death. After their parents die in a fire that destroys the family’s home, the siblings discover a letter addressed to them by their mother and father among the debris. 
“At times the world may seem an unfriendly and sinister place, but believe that there is much more good in it than bad,” Violet narrates. “All you have to do is look hard enough. And what might seem to be a series of unfortunate events may in fact be the first steps of a journey.” 
Her parents’ emphasis on seeing the best in the worst speaks greatly on the current global situation. As governments, doctors and organizations fight against the coronavirus, we must not forget that through this adversity we will emerge whole and tenacious. Similar to the way the outbreak of the virus has altered people’s lives in the span of days, the death of the Baudelaire children’s parents changed their lives forever. At the ages of just 14, 12 and possibly 1 (although undetermined), Violet, Klaus and Sunny are forced to navigate the ups and downs of the real world. The uncertainty of a promising future adds to their strenuous battle as they get passed around from relative to relative in each sequential book. 
Before delving into their story, I want to iterate that in no way do I intend to belittle the current situation and the threat the coronavirus poses to society. I extend my personal sorrows and love to those suffering in any way because of it. With China in the process of healing, Italy deep in the trenches attempting to decrease the death toll and the United States in the midst of policy uncertainty, countries around the world are uniting in the hope of alleviating the global health crisis.  
Yet with this tragedy, I urge you all to keep your spirits up. From having to escape the cruelty of Count Olaf, to witnessing their Aunt Josephine fall out of a large window and to encountering another tragic fire, the three Baudelaire children face the unimaginable at the turn of every page in the series. Having their fair share of near-death experiences, these children are the very definition of perseverance. In stark contrast, we have it much easier. All we need to do is practice social distancing and stay at home during this quarantine. 
This is not the end of the world. 
If the Baudelaire children could push through and survive the worst of circumstances, I believe that we are all capable of navigating through these trying times. So trust me when I say that we are all going to get through this rough, trying experience. We will take it one day at a time. 
In the meantime, take advantage of the isolation and give yourself the much needed time for introspection. The extra time that we seem to have on our hands is a blessing in disguise. It gives us the opportunity to grow in our relationships with not only others, but ourselves. It reminds us that after every difficulty, there will be peace and comfort. It teaches us to be patient. 
Fortunately, I promise you that together, we will endure this series of unfortunate events.

Social distancing need not be a weeks-long (if not months-long) sentence confining members of the USC community to the couch. Sitting indoors all day may make it easy to scroll through social media and binge-watch old TV shows, but spring is a season of growth and new beginnings; this is something that we should not give up to the coronavirus without a fight. Here are six things you can do to stay healthy and live your best lives during the statewide quarantine, all of which can be done from the comfort of home. 
Indoor workouts 
Now is the time to make some fitness goals … and then break them like it’s nobody’s business. Because California’s quarantine is currently set to end in balmy April, it might be tempting to set sights on a killer workout routine that promises visible results. Alas, aiming to finish grueling workouts seldom work out as planned. If you’re interested in moving your body and centering your mind, try “Yoga with Adriene” on Youtube. This channel offers a 30-day yoga practice featuring light grounding meditation as well as more challenging core exercises. 
If you’re looking for a good old-fashioned cardio workout, head over to “Body Project” on Youtube. This channel features combined HIIT, cardio, yoga, resistance training and pilates workouts with an energetic instructor encouraging users at home. USC Student Affairs also features many beginner workouts on its Fitness page, with live “USC Trojan Fitness” workouts on Youtube  scheduled throughout the week. Don’t have a mat? Use a towel! 
E-library books, audiobooks and USC Libraries resources
There are many free library apps, most notably Libby,  Hoopla and USC Libraries’ resources — all of which offer different reading experiences. The Libby app allows users to enter their local library card information and get access to local and worldwide collections. Libby functions much like a real library does and users must often join waitlists before they can read popular novels. Hoopla works in a similar way, but it cuts the waitlist and instead allows users to borrow ten items per month. 
While most students use the USC Libraries catalog for research, few are aware that they have access to Kanopy, a streaming service focused primarily on collecting historical films and documentaries. Whatever your favorite genre, these online resources make it possible to enjoy a daring journey or partake in momentous historical events while sipping a steaming cup of tea.
Get creative with stews, soups and sweets
Now is the perfect time to break away from overdone and convenient dishes and to flex new recipes in the kitchen. For easy dinner recipes, check out Brit + Co for “30 Easy Crock-Pot Dinners You Can Prep in 20 Minutes or Less.” And for the vegan Trojans out there, try “One-Pot Vegan-Lentil Soup” from The Minimalist Baker, which makes four servings of savory potatoes, greens, lentils, carrots and celery fit for long nights at home.
If you’d rather skip to dessert, try a variation of easy-to-make Five Layer Bars. Crush two cups of graham crackers and a stick of melted butter in a pan to make a crust, then pour sweetened condensed milk, white and dark chocolate chips, coconut flakes and any additional toppings of your choice. Bake for 15-20 minutes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit until the toppings melt and the condensed milk bubbles golden brown. Cut into squares and chill for a decadent treat. The beauty of this classic recipe is that you can add nuts, dried fruit or flavored chocolate chips to make the recipe your own.
Wellness
USC has many online resources for students looking for a supportive community, and the University has expanded its online group resources during this time of remote learning. Mindful USC is now offering online, weekly mindfulness workshops. On the Mindful USC app, users are asked about their current emotions and then suggested guided meditations to help ground their thoughts. While meditation is a private practice, this series of workshops helps members share their inner journeys with like-minded individuals. Mindful USC is unique in that it offers students this collaborative space to work through beginning and intermediate mediations, making the learning process flexible and enjoyable.
USC also offers students free access to Be Unlimited, a wellness training website that helps users build psychological fitness. Emotional intelligence, just like any muscle, needs a killer workout.
Visit a zoo or museum
Yes, you can visit museums while maintaining social distancing! Over 15 museums, including the Broad Museum in Los Angeles and the British Museum in London feature online collections. The London Museum’s “Museum of the World” module takes viewers through time as they click on select pieces to learn more about different cultures and their artistic past. History buffs can also create a free account on Khan Academy, which features hundreds of videos about art pieces from various time periods and creative eras. 
And for animal lovers, head over to the San Diego Zoo webpage for habitat live cams — the Koala-cam is located in the perfect spot to watch these furry friends snuggle without a care in the world.
Volunteer
There are tons of opportunities for students to share their skills online. United Nations Volunteers and Smithsonian “volunpeers” can help translate and transcribe everything from instructional training guides to outdated Chinese currency. Good Samaritans can also help improve website function by troubleshooting and creating content for United Nations promotional videos and research campaigns about monthly rainfall data. Be My Eyes is a micro-volunteering app that helps connect vision impared users with volunteers who help them complete everyday tasks. 
Crafty individuals can get busy at home learning how to knit clothing for Warm Up America, weave survival bracelets for Operation Gratitude or even make scratching boards for your local animal shelter using recycled cardboard. Whatever your capacity to help, there is something all individuals can do to make the world better without leaving the house.
With so many activities to fill the time in between Zoom meetings, you may decide working from home has more to offer than what first meets the eye. Members of the USC community can use this opportunity to explore ways to improve the world around them. Perhaps one of these will stick and become a hobby.

Keck Hospital and Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center have implemented a no-visitor policy to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, Keck Medicine of USC announced Wednesday. The policy is among the measures the medical center is taking to mitigate the pandemic’s damage after a Keck Medical Center employee tested positive for the virus Monday.
Exceptions to the no-visitor policy will be made for patients in critical or terminal condition, a Keck a Wednesday press release stated. Elective surgeries may be delayed during the pandemic, although decisions to postpone procedures will be made on an individual basis.
Beginning last week, all Keck patients are being screened for the coronavirus and recommended for appropriate treatment when necessary. All caregivers at Keck Medicine have been authorized to conduct telemedicine appointments to reduce the number of people in the medical facilities.
“All of our procedures are developed for the maximum safety and care of our patients,” Keck Medicine Chief Medical Officer Dr. Stephanie Hall said in the press release. “The ability of our providers to provide virtual visits is an especially important development as we fight this outbreak.”
The medical centers will also reduce the number of entrances and screen for fever at each entry point. Visitors and patients with respiratory symptoms, including sore throat, cough or runny nose, will receive a mask and a clinical evaluation.
Keck medical students will no longer work directly with patients and have stopped clinical rotations indefinitely. Staff at Keck Medicine are banned from domestic and international work-related travel, and individuals who leave the country will be tested for the coronavirus upon their return.
“As COVID-19 spreads, we will continue to take all necessary precautions to protect our patients, staff and community and to effectively manage this virus,” Keck Medical Center CEO and Keck Medicine Chief Operations Officer Rodney Hanners said in the press release.
Los Angeles County confirmed 128 new cases of the coronavirus Monday, bringing the county total to 536 cases and seven deaths. California has more than 2,000 cases to date, the fourth most of any U.S. state.

When professors of architecture Alvin Huang and Doris Sung accepted their full-time faculty positions, they never imagined that they would be leading the entire architecture graduate and undergraduate student body respectively. Now, with more than two decades of combined teaching experience under their belt, they will join the senior faculty of the USC School of Architecture as directors of undergraduate and graduate programming, respectively. 
Sung and Huang will assume their new positions in May and will oversee the academic aspects of existing and developing programs in the school, including curriculum design and extracurriculars. 
The application process was conducted by School of Architecture Dean Milton Curry and a panel of faculty members who assessed candidates on their goals for the school and past educational experiences with students. 
“They’re outstanding faculty who are proven strong teachers, advocates for students and researchers that are well known and influential throughout the architectural field,” Curry said. “They’re really thought leaders in thinking about how to further integrate technology into thinking about how we train architects for the future.”
Huang, a class of 1998 graduate, joined the School of Architecture faculty in 2011 as a founder of design firm Synthesis Design + Architecture and winner of the Presidential Emerging Practice of the Year by the American Institute of Architects. His work has been published and exhibited by the American Institute of Architects and he was selected as one of Time’s 2013 Best Inventors. 
Sung joined the architecture faculty in 2006 and has taught courses such as “Materials and Methods of Building Construction” and “Taming Smart Materials,” classes that focused on educating students on materials commonly used by architects. In the past, she held a teaching position at the University of Colorado and founded the firm dO|Su Studio of Architecture in 1999. 
“Being an educator for 28 years … and a part of different programs across the U.S. I think I have pretty good insight [on teaching architecture],” Sung said. “Also, because my kids are also college age, I have also insight on how millennials and Gen Z think.”
Huang pursued architecture because he believed the subject had greater academic depth than other liberal arts programs. 
“I would consider [architecture] one of the last remaining true liberal arts,” Huang said. “You learn about culture, you learn about philosophy, about society, about history, technology. You learn how … [to] convince people about your ideas, and that kind of stuff is applicable in every field.”
Sung said continuing the architecture school’s accreditation process will prove arduous with trying to balance the curriculum required by the National Architectural Accrediting Board with supplementary opportunities, such as electives and architecture design competitions for students. 
“I also think that just philosophically, undergraduate and then graduate education should be more broadening then specialized,” Sung said. “Whether or not they even go into that field, they can actually look more deeply into areas of their interest and even outside of them.”
Huang said the graduate program initiative would include expanding the range of electives to include topics such as architecture in Los Angeles. 
“One of the things we are probably leading on would be the fact that we are in Los Angeles, one of the design meccas of the world. We’ve got more landmark projects by Pritzker-winning architects than any other city in the world.” Huang said. “So there’s a significant kind of architectural pedigree that the city has that we’d like to leverage as something that architecture [students] would also be interested in.”
Carlos Auces, a graduate student in the architecture program, is currently being mentored by Huang for his thesis project and believes that Huang would be a perfect fit for the job because of his approach to dealing with students. 
”One of the things that I do appreciate about [Huang] is that he … tries to understand where you’re coming from and tries to correct you upon your thought process, not upon his thought process,” Auces said. 
For the undergraduate program, Sung plans to implement classes about sustainability in architecture and the use of smart materials that respond to technology. She also plans to increase the number of design projects available to present students with an opportunity to build structures on campus.  
“We have to really rethink how millennials and Gen Z students operate and think so that we can prepare them the best for the field,” Sung said. “Instead of overvaluing the path to licensure, it’s a matter of really thinking carefully where and how we prepare our students to actually do all kinds of things.”
For Huang, the main goal for the graduate program is to create citizen architects — students with the expertise and capability to execute complex design projects and engage diverse groups of people on societal issues. 
“We are going to be looking at all of our design studios to think about social and cultural problems that affect contemporary society — things like identity politics, gentrification, resource scarcity, changes in culture,” Huang said. “On the flip side … training architects to think about the built environments and the practice of architecture as an opportunity to think about alternatives for the future.”
Huang also aims to increase student diversity by reaching out to marginalized communities and international students and encourage them to apply to the school. 
“This country is historically dominated by white men and we’re now at a shift in our society where the value of diversity is being celebrated,” Huang said. “The value of representation is something that I think can’t be understated as someone who grew up as a child of immigrants.” 
With only a few months before the two settle into their new jobs, both Sung and Huang said they are excited about the upcoming opportunities and their ideas for the field of architecture. 
“It truly is a new chapter for not only the School of Architecture, but for USC, so to be part of that is so hopeful and so future-oriented,” Sung said.

A parent in the college admissions scandal was released from prison two weeks before the end of his sentence due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus after an inmate in California State Prison, Los Angeles County became the first California prisoner to test positive for the virus Sunday.
Napa Valley winemaker Agustin Huneeus Jr. was sentenced to five months in prison, two years of supervised release, 500 hours of community service and fined $100,000 last October for pledging to pay $300,000 to rig his daughter’s SAT and falsely designate her as a water polo recruit on her USC application.
Huneeus submitted a request in court to shorten his sentence and was granted early release last week. Federal judge Indira Talwani, the judge who oversaw the hearing requesting Huneeus’ release, cited his “extraordinary and compelling” circumstances, which included a publicly undisclosed health condition. 
Los Angeles business executive Devin Sloane, who was sentenced to four months in prison in September for arranging for his son’s 2018 admission to USC as a water polo recruit, also requested an early dismissal but was denied by the same judge who granted Huneeus his release. According to Talwani, Sloane did not seek alternative methods of gaining release before appealing to the court. 
Huneeus paid scheme organizer William “Rick” Singer $50,000 in April 2018 to arrange for his daughter to get extended time on the SAT and for her answers to be corrected at the testing center. He paid senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel $50,000 in fall 2018 for creating an athletic recruitment profile for his daughter that listed fabricated water polo awards and used a photo of a different water polo player. 
Heinel presented Huneeus’ daughter to an admissions subcommittee for approval, and she was granted conditional acceptance to the University in November 2018 to matriculate in Fall 2019. Huneeus pledged to pay Singer an additional $200,000 but was charged in the case before the transaction could be finalized. 
Huneeus and Sloane are among 20 parents who have pleaded guilty in the college admissions case. Fifteen parents, including 11 with ties to USC, pleaded not guilty and will stand trial beginning in October.

On March 15, the NFL Players Association voted to approve a new collective bargaining agreement proposed by NFL owners that will remain in effect for the next 10 years. Despite public objections to the initial terms that the Players Association secured in its negotiations with the NFL by a handful of high-profile players, enough rank-and-file NFLPA members supported the agreement to ensure its passage.
However, though the CBA will financially benefit players league-wide, it lacks the structural reforms needed to make the professional football business model sustainable for the long-term.
It is not difficult to discern why the majority of voting NFLPA members favored the labor agreement’s passage: The players voted in their short-term financial interest. The new agreement will bump the players’ share of the NFL’s revenue pie from 47% to 48% and will gradually increase the current minimum player salary of $510,000 to $1.065 million by 2030, including an immediate $100,000 raise for the 2020 season. It also contains player-friendly provisions narrowing the scope of the NFL’s drug-testing regime – eliminating suspensions for players who test positive for marijuana – and increasing retirees’ pensions.
But by putting the players – especially the roughly 60% of players who make the current minimum salary – in a position where they would not have benefited financially by opposing the CBA, the NFL got away with neglecting its obligation to ensure its players’ long-term safety and well-being.
Extensive research in the past two decades has shed light on the adverse long-term health effects of playing in the NFL, especially relating to the high incidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in former NFL players. The new labor agreement is poised to exacerbate the stress imposed on players’ bodies and minds and gives NFL owners the opportunity to add a 17th regular-season game starting in 2021 — which they will welcome given the prospect of increased revenue. It also bumps the number of teams that make the playoffs from 12 to 14 each year, thus providing for two additional playoff games during Wild Card Weekend.
Adding an additional game for every team might seem insignificant, but it is bound to have detrimental effects on players whose bodies and brains are already pushed to the brink of permanent deterioration under the current schedule format.
In an article for Bleacher Report, former NFL player Ryan Riddle described the physical toll incurred by players during each NFL season.
“With every fall, every tackle, every forearm to the rib cage and helmet flying at you like a torpedo, the damage and physical stress you accumulate over time wear away at the body’s ability to combat such an onslaught of external forces,” Riddle said.
The physical impact of additional games will matter, even if it is only one to two more games for every team each season. Every added week of playing means more hits, leading to more brain trauma and more injuries as well as untold long-term pain.
The average NFL career is 2.5 years long, a statistic that demonstrates the value of one game on NFL players’ physical welfare. This figure is attributed in large part to the physical toll incurred by playing professional football. But even if NFL owners are more concerned about their own profit than players’ health, there is still reason to temper the league’s adverse physical impact on players rather than exacerbate it.
Owners don’t seem to care much about the growing perception of their league as exploitative and dangerous, but they should.
The new CBA is set to last 10 seasons, with no opt-out provisions for either side. That means the CBA’s provisions exacerbating the game’s physical toll on players – which have already been widely criticized for doing so – are locked into place for the next 10 years.
Illustrating the extent to which public opinion can evolve in 10 years is the issue of CTE. As of 2010, evolving academic research had identified the link between CTE and playing in the NFL. This, along with depictions of CTE in popular culture such as the 2015 film “Concussion” and the speculated role of CTE in tragedies like Junior Seau’s 2012 suicide and Aaron Hernandez’s 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd and his eventual death by suicide, the brain health of football players has become a hot-button issue in 2020. The NFL has adopted rules minimizing the number of helmet-to-helmet hits — which have been identified as the primary cause of brain trauma — but the new CBA seems to suggest that the NFL is backsliding on this issue.
Based on the trajectory at which CTE became a widely known, controversial issue, one can only guess the magnitude of controversy that the NFL will be subject to by the time its new CBA expires in 2030. Rather than making the difficult decisions necessary to protect players, NFL owners have decided to seek short-term profit at the expense of their players’ permanent health and the sport’s long-term success.
