USC might have full control of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum before the end of the fall semester, according to a report by ESPN Los Angeles.

USC will meet with the Coliseum Commission, the stadium’s governing board, Sept. 7. After this meeting, according to ESPN Los Angeles, the commission is expected to negotiate a master lease with the university, which would transfer control of the Coliseum from the commission, which includes nine representatives from the state, county and city, to the university.
The university lobbied for control of the Coliseum in 2007, but ultimately agreed to a 25-year lease that stipulates the university will give 8 percent of ticket sales and $1.8 million to the commission annually, provided the commission supports upgrades to the stadium.
Under the agreement, the commission has until Sept. 30 to present USC with a plan for implementing renovations to the stadium. If the commission does not have a plan by that point, the university can declare a default. At that point, the university could choose to undertake the upgrades itself and bill the commission, according to councilman and commission member Bernard Parks. If that happens, said Parks, there is the possibility the commission could not afford it.
USC has acknowledged it would like to take control of the stadium.
“USC is working to make sure that all parties are meeting their obligations related to the Coliseum under our contract,” Thomas Sayles, senior vice president for university relations, said in a statement. “Our goal is to ensure that the facility continues to be a long-term asset for the community and for the university. To that end, we have believed for some time that having a master lease would be in the best long-term interests of the community and the university.”
Parks, who represents the district that includes USC, is the only member of the commission who has opposed giving USC control of the stadium. Parks said he believes the commission should try to work with multiple tenants to grow its revenue and emphasize the point that it can financially support renovations.
Specifically, Parks hopes the Coliseum will be the temporary home of the NFL team that might come to Los Angeles. According to the Los Angeles Times, however, AEG, the company looking to build a stadium Downtown, has said it will only consider using the Coliseum if it can negotiate with USC, not the commission. Additionally, USC’s lease gives it a say in the decision about whether or not to give an NFL team space in the Coliseum.
Parks said he does not know that the Sept. 7 meeting will specifically include a vote on whether or not to pursue a master lease; he is still focusing on the Sept. 30 deadline. ESPN LA reports, however, that some expect the university and the commission to have an agreement on the master lease by Dec. 7.

USC is launching its first science filmmaking competition today to promote student collaboration across disciplines and to communicate complex science concepts through different means.
Clifford Johnson, a professor of physics and astronomy, began developing a plan to hold the competition in 2008 after receiving a National Science Foundation grant. He wants students to develop creative methods for explaining complicated science topics through interdisciplinary collaboration.
“The idea was to involve students in making films and training the future scientists, writers, journalists, filmmakers and people from other fields to appreciate how better to communicate science ideas,” he said.
The project also aims to give students the opportunity to learn from each other through the process.
“Through this competition, people can understand each other’s craft better,” Johnson said.
Johnson said there are significant problems with how science is communicated and perceived, and creating films with students from different disciplines can help bridge that gap.
“The point is getting people from different departments — whether you’re a film major, science major, English major or business major — to work with each other when they otherwise wouldn’t have,” Johnson said. “It’s all about cross-collaboration, creating more openness in the future and better communication.”
Johnson, who has co-written a play about scientists, co-produced educational videos and is currently working on a physics-related graphic novel, said conveying information through different media is an important skill.
“The key thing is that the film communicates a science idea, principle or concept, and it can be done in any way that’s a good film,” Johnson said. “It could be a music video, or a standard documentary, a drama, or even an animation.”
Film entries will be posted to the competition’s YouTube page and a jury of USC faculty and outside experts will select winners.
Teams must include at least one student from a science department, the Viterbi School of Engineering or the Keck School of Medicine, and at least one from the USC School of Cinematic Arts or Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
Students majoring in science-related fields said they appreciate the chance to share their knowledge. Tammy Bui, a senior majoring in biology, said she thought the program would be very successful.
“Many [science students] love nothing more than sharing what we care about to the surrounding community,” Bui said. “This opportunity will not only allow us to do what we are passionate about but it will, more importantly, allow us to bring awareness to others.”
Some film students, including Brian Lam, a senior majoring in film production, believe there is  little incentive for film students to participate in the competition because of the specialization of the content.
“I personally wouldn’t be interested in a competition like that, because people usually don’t produce films specifically for one festival,” Lam said. “It’s a better investment of time and resources to make a film that can be submitted to multiple festivals or competitions.”
Susan Lee, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention studies, said she would feel challenged to find people outside her major.
“It makes it much more difficult to find team members outside of one’s immediate major,” Lee said. “However, this could very well be a challenge that encourages some to enter, as they look for opportunities to network with new people.”
Prizes for the best three films, including a $2,500 first-place prize, will be funded through the Anton Burg Foundation, named in honor of the founder of the USC chemistry department.
“The prize is not as important as exploring and making a film that you would never have made before, and hopefully there will be a lot of films that people will enjoy,” Johnson said. “Reach out, and go outside of your comfort zone. The kinds of friendships you make doing these kinds of collaborative projects last a long time throughout your career.”
The deadline for competition registration is Oct. 8 and the final submission deadline is Jan. 11.
I appreciate this. I’m a creative person and my current job has me working mostly with scientists and researchers dealing with highly technical concepts. I don’t understand 95% of what they’re talking about and find that, unfortunately, many in these fields don’t do the best job at explaining what they do to generate the interest of the layperson. Some have a knack for “dumbing it down”. Most don’t.
Science and Art combining what a great idea.
[…] Monday I did an interview with a student reporter for the Daily Trojan and that appeared this morning. (Have a read.) I’m a bit embarrassed that they missed out mentioning my colleague and […]

With 28th Street silent Monday because of the ongoing social ban put in place by the university, “Black Monday”, the Monday after the end of rush, lived on in facilities just slightly off The Row.
People at the 901 Bar & Grill on Figueroa and West 29th streets and the new West 27th Place housing complex on Figueroa and West 27th streets noticed an increase in partying at their respective facilities Monday night.
“Sales were twice as much as last year on the Monday after rush,” said Danny Costanzo, manager of the 901 Bar & Grill.
Costanzo said the social ban has likely had an effect on those numbers, but he is unsure if the social ban will fare well for his business in the long run.
“I think we still have to let it play out and see,” Costanzo said. “But I’d say for the short term [business] is good.”
West 27th Place has also noticed a lot of activity in the building after 10 p.m, the building’s official quiet hours.
“Last night there was more partying and it was louder than even the weekend,” said Tabitha Stephens, property manager of West 27th Place. “We have upped our courtesy patrol and we have met with the campus police and LAPD.”
Stephens said she has already sent out letters to the residents reminding them the building is a community and not a dorm or a fraternity house. Other than a mechanical elevator incident last week, no enforcement personnel have had to intervene so far.
Sarah Joseph, a junior majoring in neuroscience and resident of West 27th Place, said the building has been housing parties that would have normally taken place on The Row.
“This place probably has more parties because it is further from campus and it is a new facility, but at the same time it is close to The Row,” Joseph said. “I hope the parties stop after they let up on the restrictions.  There was a lot of crazy stuff last night.”
The Dept. of Public Safety has also noticed a student migration to alternative partying facilities and are aware of what that means in terms of safety and enforcement.
“With current restrictions on social events on 28th Street, it is clear that West 27th Place has become one of the most popular locations,” DPS Capt. David Carlisle said. “We are concerned about safety issues as it becomes more popular. DPS has reached out to management of West 27th Place because we would like to work with them to make it safer.”
So glad I didn’t move into West 27th! hah
DPS needs full access to West 27th to keep everyone safe.

Stadiums don’t get much more historic than the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Host of two Olympic Games, two Super Bowls and the 1959 World Series, the Coliseum could make a strong claim to the title of America’s most storied sporting backdrop.
It’s also true, however, that stadiums don’t get much more rundown than the Coliseum.
It lacks many of the amenities that other top college football programs enjoy, namely luxury suites, adequate restrooms and comfortable seating.
The stadium hosted its first football game in 1923 and it looks every bit of its 88 years of age.
The Coliseum used to be a feared fortress for Trojan football, providing one of the sport’s biggest home field advantages.
In its current state of disrepair, it’s a blight on the university.
Let me be clear: I’m not advocating a move away from the Coliseum.
Tradition is rightfully king in college football and USC should do everything in its power to keep playing at the Coliseum for as long as possible.
The problem, however, is the university’s say in stadium improvements is limited by its current lease agreement.
The Coliseum is jointly owned by the state of California, the county of Los Angeles and the city of Los Angeles.
Representatives from each group form the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, which runs the stadium’s day-to-day operations, and its track record isn’t pretty.
A February investigation by the Los Angeles Times revealed the commission’s former events manager Todd DeStefano had funneled at least $1.7 million in Coliseum event deals to firms he owned.
The investigation also revealed Patrick Lynch, the commission’s former general manager, bought several cars for personal use with the Coliseum’s money.
In the midst of the scandal, finance director Ronald Lederkramer received a $25,000 raise that was later rescinded when the city controller questioned the pay increase.
Finally, this summer brought news that the Coliseum Commission’s cash reserves had fallen from $12 million to $1.6 million in three years’ time, leaving the group unable to pay for $60 million in stadium improvements promised to USC in the two parties’ lease agreement.
The hard truth is that the government can no longer afford to run the Coliseum.
Ignoring the lack of quality concessions and the crumbling seats, the Coliseum Commission instead chose to install a 6,000-square-foot video board this summer, saving roughly $9 million in the process.
So, while you might be stuck eating a lukewarm hot dog on a splintering wooden bench, you can now pass the time between quarters counting the number of dirty blond hairs sprouting out the top of the visor on Lane Kiffin’s massively magnified head.
If you didn’t know any better, the $6-million video board might actually sound like a pretty sizable investment. That’s at least until you hear that the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif. is in the middle of a $152-million renovation that will add luxury suites and update antiquated restrooms and concession stands, among other improvements.
The NFL’s proposed move to Los Angeles has ratcheted up interest in the deal between USC and the Coliseum.
If a professional team were to relocate to Los Angeles, a new Downtown stadium wouldn’t be ready to host NFL games for at least a couple of seasons.
The Coliseum and the Rose Bowl would be the top candidates to temporarily house the team, and the city of Los Angeles wouldn’t want to miss out on potential ticket and parking revenue a NFL franchise could bring were it to play in Exposition Park.
Los Angeles city council officials have made it clear that maintaining public control over the stadium is the ideal situation.
There comes a point, however, when a USC takeover of the Coliseum makes financial sense for both parties.
The commission’s financial troubles and a potential NFL move to Los Angeles has given USC a golden opportunity to take over control of the Coliseum.
The university can veto any decision to allow an NFL team to play in the Trojans’ home stadium, which means even if the city can lure a professional team to the Coliseum for two seasons, USC still has the final say.
USC can also take over the master lease of the stadium if the commission is unable to pay for the agreed-upon improvements to the Coliseum.
With total control, the university could make the Coliseum profitable in the long term and implement the changes the aging stadium desperately needs.
Instead of a dreary monument to a glorious past, the Coliseum could once again be a modern, fitting home to one of the nation’s best football programs.

Good stuff man. Love the ideas. The article is a great easy read. Although i do like the big screen. Keep it up JK
Wooden seats: have you been to the Coliseum?
Luxury Suites: really? One of things that makes SC football so great is that everyone sits outdoors–no secluded detached luxury patrons eschewing the game for the comforts behind the glass.
Uncomfortable seats: let me know when you find one in a sports venue.
Yes, it needs structural and some repairs–but it’s nothing as bad as the rose bowl with its wooden benches and lack of egress. Let’s fix it, but let’s not make silly changes.
All in all, I love watching games at the Coliseum, I think most people do and the players love playing there.
Sometimes.

Former USC teammates and champions Robert Farah and Steve Johnson were reunited for a brief moment as the 2009 and 2010 Pac-10 Doubles Team of the Year both qualified to play in the U.S. Open main draw.

Farah punched his ticket by way of defeating three opponents — Germany’s Dominik Meffert and Andre Begemann and Brazil’s Julio Silva.
On Tuesday, the native Colombian faced France’s Nicolas Mahut, jumping out to an early two-set lead.
Mahut mounted a comeback, however, and managed to take away the next three sets as Farah fell in five sets 6-3, 7-6 (4), 2-6, 4-6, 6-0.
Before returning to the United States to compete in the qualifying rounds for the U.S. Open, Farah played professionally in Colombia, winning four singles titles and two doubles titles. His most recent accomplishment was winning the 2010 Seguros Bolivar Open in Bogotá.
At USC, Farah led the Trojans to the first of their three consecutive NCAA championships and also won the 2008 NCAA doubles championship.
Johnson, who earned a wild-card spot by virtue of winning the 2011 NCAA singles championship, will face USA’s Alex Bogomolov Jr. today at 11 a.m.
The three-time NCAA champion will return for his senior season at USC this year as the Trojans attempt to win their fourth consecutive title.
Along with Johnson, USC also returns senior Daniel Nguyen and sophomores Ray Sarmiento, Emilio Gomez, Michael Grant and Corey Smith from its 2011 national championship team.
The Trojans upended then-undefeated No. 1 Virginia by a score of 4-3 in the NCAA title match in late May.
If Johnson advances, he will likely face No. 6 seed Robin Soderling, who has advanced to the quarterfinals the last two years in  the U.S. Open.

For No. 25 USC, it’s just three days away.
With an up-and-down off-season behind them, the Trojans can finally turn their attention to their season opener Saturday against Minnesota.
Though some questions regarding the team still linger, junior safety and recently appointed captain T.J. McDonald was excited with how the defense has come together during spring and fall camp.

“We’re just a year better than we were last year,” McDonald said. “We were a young defense last year with a new coaching staff. Now we know what their expectations are and they know what kind of players they have and what to expect from us.”
While the progress made by the defense is assuring, USC coach Lane Kiffin was quick to point out that the Trojans’ defense, which ranked 84th in the country in total defense last year, has not proved anything yet.
“Until you play, it doesn’t really change very much,” Kiffin said. “Even though we feel better and look better, and we’re bigger, stronger and faster, until we prove it, it doesn’t matter.”
Junior quarterback Matt Barkley was pleased with the way the offense was clicking during practice and felt confident that it was game-ready.
“I think we are [ready for the season],” Barkley said. “I think there are always a few things you need to tweak before game day, but overall I think we’re ready.”

A year ago, junior running back Curtis McNeal, had to watch as his team prepared to begin the season at Hawai’i without him. During fall camp last year, McNeal was ruled academically ineligible and did not play a single snap for the Trojans.
What a difference a year makes.
Just a couple weeks after Kiffin declared McNeal had been ruled eligible and could play this year, McNeal saw his name listed at the top of the running back depth chart (along with sophomore Dillon Baxter, redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan and freshman Amir Carlisle).
Though the backfield might seem crowded to some, McNeal is just happy to be out there.
“I’m just amazed right now because I’m really playing football this year,” McNeal said. “We’re just four days away and I’m ready to go.”
With no definite starter listed and last year’s leading rusher senior Marc Tyler suspended indefinitely for comments made to TMZ, the competition for starting running back has yet to be decided by the coaching staff.

Tackling was an area of concern for the Trojans last season. Coaches cited a lack of depth as the main reason for not tackling during practice. This year, however, USC has more bodies, more depth and tackling has been stressed more heavily.
Whether the defense has improved its tackling will be made evident early Saturday, as Minnesota’s mobile quarterback MarQueis Gray, who is listed at 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds, will test the Trojans’ defense.
“He’s a huge quarterback, so when we tackle him, we have to make sure we don’t get beat taking chances,” McDonald said.  “We just have to wrap him up and take him to the ground.”
Gray, who only attempted eight passes last year, rushed for 110 yards on 23 carries in the Gophers’ last three games of the season.

Carlisle left practice Tuesday with an undisclosed injury and is listed as day-to-day.
Senior linebacker Chris Galippo practiced at full speed after returning from a shoulder injury that had plagued him most of camp. Kiffin was still skeptical as to whether or not Gallipo is ready for game speed.
“I’m still nervous about it,” Kiffin said. “This is a lot different than a real game. We’ll throw him out there and hopefully he’ll do well.”
Senior defensive tackle Armond Armstead remained out with an undisclosed medical condition.  Kiffin noted that team doctors have yet to clear him for football activities.

Celebrating the end of a month of fasting, Muslims around the world are recognizing the religious holiday Eid ul-Fitr on the first day of the Islamic month of Shawwal.
After abstaining from food and drink from sunrise to sunset for 30 days in the preceding month of Ramadan, today more than 1.4 billion Muslims are commemorating their religious heritage.
Though there is often dispute regarding the precise date of the celebrations, a bittersweet sentiment of relief and nostalgia permeates the atmosphere in countries with large Muslim populations.
The two different methods to announce the date of the celebrations — moonsighting and  calendar calculations — leads to some mosques leading the celebratory prayers Wednesday rather than Tuesday.
Muslims start off the festive day by visiting the mosque as a family to listen to a sermon, and then pray to God asking for forgiveness and acceptance for their efforts in the tribulations the previous month might have brought.
Wearing new clothes and in high spirits, Muslims take this day as an opportunity to reconnect with friends seen perhaps only on this day each year.
Cultural methods of celebration are varied, but traditionally the day is spent with family and friends, filled with sweets and gifts for children as mutual kindness and high spirits abound.
In Arab countries, cultural foods like kaahk (a type of oriental cookie in powdered sugar) are prepared and shared among the community. Elaborate decorations are used to welcome the special day.
Countries with a large population of Muslims make Eid a national holiday, and like Christmas in America, most stores and businesses are shut down to enjoy the three-day celebration.
Regardless internal differences the rest of the year, on Eid the Muslim community can come together to recognize the beauty of unity at the end of a month’s long test of willpower.

There is nothing like a night of dancing to throw off the stress from a hectic school week. But if you’re not yet 21, the club scene might seem less-than-exciting. Rest assured there are a variety of 18-plus night clubs that are more fun than high school dances and can scratch that dancing itch you’ve been carrying around.
Rage Nightclub 
The music: The tunes at Rage, West Hollywood’s gay club, will vary from night to night. Friday night is Asian night, so a visit will yield you a good dose of top-40 names and a sprinkling of tunes from Asian pop stars. Travel to the second floor for less of a crowd and some hip-hop jams.
The scene: The dance floor, albeit small, comes with two large TVs, a stage and fancy lights. Arrive early, as it gets crowded and steamy. The crowd seems to be mostly in groups, so bring along a few friends.
Rage Nightclub is located at 8911 Santa Monica Blvd.
Boardner’s by La Belle  
The music: Boardner’s nights are as diverse as its crowd. Friday nights are now Tabu nights with everything from top-40 to Latin music. Bar Sinister Saturday nights offers a completely different experience, with gothic, industrial and alternative tunes. Not all nights are 18-plus, but the venue is still very friendly toward those younger than 21.
The scene: Boardner’s has two floors decorated in a vintage style, complete with small chandeliers, comfortable couches inside and out and even gleaming black ashtrays. Though the pedestals say professional dancers only, that doesn’t stop a few brave souls from rocking out on top of them. Plan on seeing a diverse crowd no matter the night. Most club-goers are friendly and willing to just sit and chat when the dance floor gets too hot.
Boardner’s is located at 1652 North Cherokee Ave.
Club DV8/Level 3
The music: Each DJ changes the flavor of the night, but since this is a club advertised by KIIS FM on a regular basis, the emphasis is mostly on loud, naughty music. Expect heavy amounts of raunchy hip-hop, à la early 50 Cent, with some top-40 sprinkled in.
The scene: The interior of DV8 is posh with two dance floor areas and white curtained rooms. Security is tight, so be ready to be branded with Xs on both hands if you’re not 21 and supervised by flashlight-armed security weaving through the dance floor. Subtle invitations to dance do not exist in this club, so be prepared for the unexpected. There is also a stripper pole-clad stage, and, as the night progresses, a group of go-go dancers keeps the vibe going.
Club DV8/Level 3 is located at 6801 Hollywood Blvd.
The Echoplex 
The music: Though better known for being a concert venue for up-and-coming bands, this venue also has club nights. You can groove to a variety of tunes, including specialty nights like The Smiths night — a night exclusively dedicated to The Smiths’ music. The age limit and cover fee varies, so check online ahead of time.
The scene: Expect an eclectic mix of styles, ages and music tastes. The dance floor is not too large and the crowd seems to travel mostly in groups, but the stand-only tables are a good place to chat with someone new and sip a drink.
If you’re not 21, a shockingly sweet Shirley Temple will run you only $3.
The Echoplex is located at 1822 Sunset Blvd.
Florentine Gardens 
The music: This is definitely one of those clubs where it’s hard to hear yourself think, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The music includes everything from old and new hip-hop to top-40 tunes.
The scene: Prepare to wait in line and be thoroughly patted down by security before going inside. The dance floor is surprisingly large with various lights and more than a few boxes to stand and flaunt your moves on. Those of you under 21 will not be allowed inside the bar, but there is a separate room where you can buy soda, water and even take advantage of a buffet that includes dishes like spaghetti and pasta salad. The room also includes ’50s-diner-like tables where you can cool off.
Florentine Gardens is located at 5951 Hollywood Blvd.

There will soon be no need for trips to the local GameStop. All of the big-name retailers’ video games are going to be coming straight to your living room with the advent of game streaming.
GameStop recently announced plans to begin streaming console and PC games nationwide to PlayStation 3s, Xbox 360s and PCs sometime next year.
The company has already begun beta testing the service after acquiring Spawn Labs, a company specializing in game streaming technology, last March. A closed beta testing session is scheduled to start in the next couple months.
In short, GameStop is basically pulling a Netflix by trying to capitalize on instant streaming.
But what does the future hold for this new technology?
So far, GameStop has announced few details, but the idea sounds solid. We live in an era in which entertainment is instantly accessible with the click of a mouse. If we can stream movies and TV shows, then why can’t we stream video games?
GameStop’s business move is more than practical: it’s respectable. Considering the immensity of the market, instant streaming is the next logical step. Contrary to stereotypes portraying gamers as primarily reclusive young males, a 2006 study conducted by Associated Press-AOL Games concluded approximately 40 percent of Americans play video games.
With such a large number of potential gamers, GameStop’s plans for instant streaming hold a lot of potential for future success. People won’t have to buy games at full price or wait for GameFly discs to arrive by mail anymore. The technology will give consumers the ability to casually browse and test games without having to commit to buying them.
Given the current status of our economy, people aren’t so quick to run out and buy a single game with a $50 price tag. Thus, a leisurely streaming service offering full access to numerous games is an ideal way to keep gamers interested.
GameStop’s plans signal that the video game industry is changing to become more of a “can-do-everything” service. Remember the days when consoles were built for the sole purpose of playing compatible video game cartridges? Now PlayStation 3s double as high-definition Blu-ray players and Xbox 360s carry internal Wi-Fi and 250GB hard drives. It’s as though console is the new word for computer.
With such possibilities, it’s no wonder GameStop wants to expand the game industry. If anything, GameStop’s move is an incredibly intuitive one that is responding to the public’s increasing desire for convenient, multifunctional technology. People should have the option to stream games directly to their consoles just like they can stream movies and TV shows to their laptops.
Of course, with any new technological development, there are bound to be initial problems with the service once it is released.
For one, GameStop will be competing with Gaikai and OnLive, two companies that offer streaming services exclusively for PC games. But GameStop’s addition of console games puts the other two companies at a significant disadvantage, and it is difficult to tell whether or not the competition will be brutal.
Some people are also hesitant to laud GameStop’s plans so soon. Internet posts are already speculating problems to accompany the future service, namely how much bandwidth it will require, how high the prices will be and whether multiplayer will be a viable option.
If GameStop has learned anything from its Netflix doppelgänger, it should be that price hikes are out of the question. Streaming must remain at a reasonable price if GameStop hopes to create a stable, dedicated coalition of subscribers.
Though several of these concerns are indeed plausible, it is too early to tell whether GameStop will invest enough time and energy into its service before launching it. Once the closed beta testing session begins by the end of this year, hopefully it will become clearer as to what type of service this will really be and whether or not GameStop is truly serious about making this technology a reliable and efficient one.
The idea of instant streaming has the potential to be revolutionary for the game industry, but it cannot succeed without price checks, quality streaming and, above all, a more-than-satisfactory game collection.

School’s been back in session for merely a week and a half, but sooner or later students will be back to the routine of heading to the library, writing research papers or reading pages for chemistry. Thankfully, not all students need to be tortured by the sickening salmon walls of Leavey Library. Los Angeles offers a splendid variety of intimate cafes perfect for studying and snacking.
Study time · Coffee shops like Bricks & Scones are great escapes from campus that are intriguing as tourist and homework spots. - Mollie McKenzie | Daily Trojan
Madeleine Coffee and Pastry 
Madeleine Coffee and Pastry opened only late last semester but is already transforming from a hidden secret to USC’s cafe around the corner. The prices are beyond reasonable, and the samples and Wi-Fi are free.
Besides the regular assortment of teas and coffees, Madeleine demonstrates a strong inventive spirit in signature drinks like the sinfully delectable Chewbacca, separating it from chains like Starbucks and Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf.
Though the cafe is on the small side and has little sitting room as of right now, it plans to set up more seating soon, according to Rosie Leonie, a barista at Madeleine’s.
Also coming up is the first “Open Mic Night,” featuring Leonie and Geoffry J.
Friendly and personable service also offers students a pleasant and intimate studying experience. But the main attraction is neither the prices nor the service, but the proximity.
Located on the corner of Figueroa and 30th Streets it’s just a short five minute walk from school.
Bricks and Scones 
Bricks and Scones is not USC’s closest cafe, but it is surely worth the 10-15 minute drive. Situated just after the corner of Beverly Street and Larchmont Boulevard, parking is limited, but street parking is usually easy to find.
Partnering with Lupicia Fresh Tea and Intelligentsia, their drinks are first rate.  You can’t go wrong with their afternoon tea and scones deal, which includes a pot of tea and two of their freshly baked scones.  Their blueberry scones and champagne rose tea completes the deal.  Students also receive a 10 percent discount when they show their school ID.
Studying at Bricks and Scones can take on a variety of forms depending on one’s dedication. The patio serves as a prime study location. Shaded by ivy, trees and umbrellas during the day and lit by twinkling white lights and heaters at night, the brick patio might be a place to get lost in beauty rather than a textbook or paper.
There’s also indoor seating, comprised of an assortment of inviting couches and leather chairs on which one finds as wide an assortment of students, teachers and intellectuals.
Additionally, a quieter option for the serious student in the midst of midterms or finals is just up the staircase in a room called The Study.
Students can expect to focus without any distractions in a room that has one rule — no talking.  Each customer receives its own private workspace, including his own desk and lamp.
Whatever option you choose, free Wi-Fi is always available.
Café Mak 
Café Mak — mak meaning “king” or “throne” in Korean — is another cafe perfect for sitting down and getting some serious studying done.  Situated in Koreatown right off Wilshire Boulevard, this unique gem offers free Wi-Fi and a staggering amount of sitting space.  A sea of mismatched cushioned chairs around tile tables that starts in the brick courtyard and continues deep into the actual building.
The relaxing and comfortable décor isn’t the only reason it’s the perfect place for a study session.
The drinks are slightly pricey, a simple tea or coffee runs more than $5, but that can keep you more focused on your studies and less focused on socializing.
Intelligentsia
A cafe to avoid is the famed chain of the truly hipster connoisseur, Intelligentsia, which is expensive but carries supremely tasty espressos.  Unfortunately, it does not meet the criteria for a study cafe because the closest coffeebar is more than 15 minutes away in Silver Lake; it doesn’t have adequate seating but instead metal chairs and tables and it’s located on the noisy and traffic-heavy Sunset Boulevard.
 
Though September is only just beginning, it’s never too early to find a good study spot. Keep these cafes in mind when it’s time to crack down and really focus on what we’re all here for: academics.
Bricks and Scones is DELICIOUS!! I love this place!!! It is usually busy (at least the times I have gone), but it is so worth the drive and the wait…the food and delicious and the tea/coffee selection is wonderful. Plus the atmosphere is really laid back and there are so great study areas. Highly recommended!

This September, Arise Magazine — an arts-and-culture publication specializing in the African fashion scene — will hold its third annual “Made in Africa” show, a collective showcase of high-end clothing by some of Africa’s most popular designers.
During its showcase at the exclusive Mercedes Benz Fashion Week in New York, the show promises cultural extravaganzas and a performance by Leona Lewis to cap the evening.
Another African Fashion Week held in New York over the summer is still garnering media attention as well. In July, a new generation of African designers took the New York fashion scene by storm in an event called Africa Fashion Week New York.
Organized by Adiat Disu of Adiree Fashion Agency, AFWNY allowed nearly 30 designers of African descent, including Project Runway’s Korto Momolu, to exhibit their creations in front of the global fashion media. From couture ball gowns and eclectic cocktail dresses to snazzy accessories and printed casual-wear, the pieces shown presented the fashion world with a celebration of African heritage unlike any other.
“The moment you think you’ve defined what Africa fashion is, expect for it to be redefined,” said Disu in an interview with CNN’s Isha Sesay.  She also spoke of her hopes for the future of African fashion: “I want boutiques and buyers to take us seriously, as designers from Africa looking to be showcased in stores.”

While others sell their soul, Brett Detar is offering his up to the world free of charge.
His solo debut Bird in the Tangle is a truly authentic American roots record, complete with slow burn, five-string banjo and stories told in twang-y country drawl. The album is candid, affecting, the perfect soundtrack for the lost and lonely — and it is available to download for free on his website.
Design by Deborah Ho | Daily Trojan
“I figured [making the album free] was the best way to get people to take a chance on somebody that they don’t know,” Detar said. “My number one goal is for people to hear the record because I believe in it.”
Bird in the Tangle is quite a departure from his former projects, which includes a 10-year run as the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Juliana Theory.
The group, made up of Detar and three childhood friends, initially formed as a joke but quickly turned into a full-time job. After five albums and nonstop touring, however, Detar lost interest in rock music and was eager for a change.
“I feel like we did everything we could in that style of music and I felt like I wasn’t fresh in it anymore,” Detar said. “My heart wasn’t in it.”
The Juliana Theory broke up amiably in 2006 after a few poor business decisions slowed the band down. Afterward, Detar quickly began to question his future as a musician. Disoriented and unsure, he moved from his hometown of Greensburg, Penn., to Los Angeles and opened up a vintage clothing store.
“I didn’t believe in myself as a songwriter, singer or musician at all,” Detar said. “I convinced myself that I should quit music.”
Despite his uncertainty, he began to write songs casually, using a portable voice recorder. Detar had not considered the idea of making a solo album, and the rough recordings piled up without him paying much attention.
“One day I just started listening to them, and I realized that there was stuff on there I thought had potential,” Detar said. “I felt like music was calling me back.”
It is clear Detar has hit his stride in the simple instrumentation and raw emotion of Americana. But his passion for the genre was no recent discovery though. Even before The Juliana Theory called it quits, Detar found himself exclusively listening to country pioneers like Loretta Lynn, Ernest Tubb and his biggest influence, Johnny Cash.
“This wasn’t me trying to force that kind of record. I sing more in my natural voice now than I ever did in the past,” Detar said. “I spent so much time with folk, bluegrass and country music that it had become a part of my musical vocabulary.”
Bird in the Tangle documents one of the most difficult points in Detar’s life. Each poignant track beautifully illustrates his loneliness and insecurity. Detar is especially proud of “The City Dies Tonight,” a harrowing duet with his wife, and “A Miner’s Prayer,” an epic period piece.
Though some of this content is new territory for him, he does not approach songwriting any differently.
“I just try to write songs from the perspective of the human condition,” Detar said. “I think about what people feel in their hearts and I try to make songs that will hopefully move somebody.”
To support the album, Detar is about to embark on an 18-city tour with Nick 13, lead singer of the psychobilly group Tiger Army. Afterward, he plans to continue on the road by himself.
“I wasn’t sure that I wanted to tour full-time,” Detar said. “But I came to the point where I thought, ‘I’ve been on the road most of my adult life. This is what I do.’”
With many songs already written, Detar is convinced he will eventually record another solo album.
“It seems like a natural extension,” Detar said. “In a lot of ways, this has been easier than anything I’ve done in the past because I can write completely by myself, whenever inspiration strikes.”
With the release of his new album, Detar’s many years of self-doubt are completely behind him, and his newfound confidence shines through. Detar is happier than ever with the path he is on, a path he believes he was destined to take.
“I could never deny my first love,” Detar said. “Sometimes you just have to accept your fate.”

When I started at USC last year, I was a little overwhelmed. USC offers such a variety of new choices and responsibilities that I felt anxious nearly all the time.
Esther Cheong | Daily Trojan
With my home just a 40-minute drive down the 110 Freeway, I started driving home almost every weekend.
The familiarity of home and its proximity to campus proved irresistible when compared to the new pressures of college life.
At first, I provided excuses for my absences — I needed to get something I had forgotten at home, I wanted to see some friends before they left for college — but as the semester wore on it became habit.
Never did I stop to question the reason for my weekly migration, nor did I realize what I was missing out on. If I ever did doubt myself, I could look around and see countless fellow Angelenos doing the same exact thing. If anything, going home for free laundry, free food or a simple escape was convenient.
It was that same convenience, however, that made this pattern of behavior harmful.
College is supposed to prepare us for the rest of our lives in terms of our careers and social skills. Depending on a safety net only a short drive away sabotages that development.
The independence fostered by one’s college experience is vital. You can’t expect to be a high-functioning member of society if you have to run back home every other week to do laundry.
The convenience of saving some quarters should be weighed against the necessity of learning to do it yourself — one shrunken, discolored T-shirt at a time.
The collection of skills needed for everyday living must be refined through blundering on our own, like a baby learning to walk. Going home, although it might feel comfortable, only makes mastering these things more difficult.
A temporary reprieve from everything is understandable, but, again, it is a solution that only creates more problems. Never again will we only be surrounded by people with whom we share mutual growing experiences.
For the rest of our lives we will encounter people from every walk of life, and the sooner we can learn to deal with this reality, the better. Going to class with all these people will surely aid students in this regard, but interacting with other students during the only time they don’t have to be worrying about classes and responsibilities is more beneficial.
The security of home life must be foregone for the more complex life on campus. This does not mean, however, parents should be discarded upon arrival to college, forgotten as some sort of relic of our past lives.
Family is a very important part of everyone’s life and should not be lost in the interest of our personal progress.
Even though we set out to become our own people with our own lives, we must make sure that our family is there to enrich it.
Despite the allure of convenience and familiarity, those of us going to school near our homes must avoid falling into the trap of robbing ourselves of the full learning experience in front of us.

Though state-of-the-art technology, world-class faculty and challenging course loads help build USC’s elite reputation, it is the room for student exploration that makes USC a top university for academic and professional undergraduate development.
In almost all major tracks, the university allows students to gather the skills they need to succeed in the industry of their choice, to have time to take electives and to become involved in extracurricular activities that might not tie in directly with their majors or career plans.
For broadcast journalism majors, however, this freedom to explore new bounds is stifled by an inflexible curriculum that locks students into the television news industry via stringent learning lab restrictions.
A learning lab is a requirement set forth by the university to give students an opportunity to “reinforce your classroom learning by giving you experience in a live news environment,” according to an Annenberg TV News document.
Print journalism and public relations students have the freedom to work for print agencies like the Daily Trojan, go online with Neon Tommy, talk on the radio with Annenberg Radio News or KXSC, or secure an outside internship to fulfill their learning lab requirement.
Broadcast journalism students do not have this liberty. The learning lab flier for ATVN claims: “There are no exceptions,” meaning broadcast journalism students must use ATVN to fulfill the learning lab requirement instead of other broadcast outlets.
During broadcast students’ freshman and sophomore years, ATVN gives them the freedom to experiment with graphics, work in the studio, become a web supervisor, write stories or pursue on-camera reporting.
This freedom dissolves junior year, as ATVN requires all broadcast students to become on-camera multimedia journalists despite the fact that many students have spent semesters growing into other positions.
This inconsistency compromises broadcast journalism students’ ability to explore all media outlets and, although Annenberg provides all broadcast journalism students with a valuable education, students pursuing careers in televised broadcasting are favored over others.
Annenberg should limit the control ATVN holds over broadcast students by allowing them to work at other media outlets to fulfill their learning lab requirements such as Trojan Vision, or by adding more courses to meet the requirement.
Television production is emphasized almost to the point of redundancy by requiring all broadcast journalism majors to carve large blocks of time out of their schedules and work for ATVN on a weekly basis.
By requiring students to work exclusively for ATVN instead of allowing them to fulfill their learning labs at any of the other organizations mentioned above, Annenberg implies that ATVN is the only academically legitimate news organization on campus and if students work elsewhere during the school year they are compromising their learning experiences.
ATVN is an accomplished station that launches quality news telecasts each day. Many of its staff members have secured prestigious positions in the television industry after graduation.
Requiring students to work at ATVN for one or two semesters could benefit broadcast journalists by exposing them to a vital component of the broadcasting industry.
Students, however, should be able to choose how they contribute to ATVN so that they can deepen their experience in the field of their choice. With the ability to choose focuses from writing to newscast production, students will maximize their experience at ATVN, rather than dabbling in areas they are less interested in.
Despite ATVN’s admirable reputation, broadcast journalism majors should have more freedom to experience broadcast media and all of its aspects.

While the search for the missing Muammar Qaddafi continues in vain, 32 members of his family were able to escape National Transitionary Council capture and cross into neighboring Algeria.
Among the party was Qaddafi’s second wife Safia, his daughter Aisha and two of his sons, Hannibal and Mohammed. Aisha gave birth to a daughter shortly after arriving. They made their escape in a convoy of armored Mercedes limousines, leaving from the town of Bani Walid, a stronghold where a significant number of regime members are currently located.
They escaped using a road not yet under NTC control and crossed over through an isolated border post in the Algerian town of Tinkarine, having traversed the length of the country north to south. They were accepted by the Algerian government after about 12 hours of deliberation.
This diplomatic approval of their actions by the Algerian government has been labeled an “enemy act” by the NTC’s interior minister. The Algerian government says it is acting on humanitarian grounds, but the NTC fears this could lead to Algeria becoming the location for the regrouping of the old Libyan regime, as well as a launching point for a counter-revolution.
Although the Algerian government promises this will not be the case, and that it will hand over Qaddafi himself to the International Crimes Court if he attempts to cross, pressure has been mounting for the return of at least Hannibal and Mohammed for their involvement in embezzling immense amounts of money from Libyan government departments.
The facility of the escape by this group of highly wanted individuals — in such a conspicuous mode of transportation as a six black limousines in the middle of the desert — shows the NTC might not have as strong a hold on the country as it would have the rest of the world to believe.
The control of the coast and the capital of Tripoli is evidence of their prowess, but these developments show the regime has not given up the fight for control just yet.

What do the Red Hot Chili Peppers, David Guetta, and Lil Wayne all have in common? They all dropped brand new albums this week. On sale now are I’m With You by the Chili Peppers, Nothing But the Beat by Guetta, and Tha Carter IV from Lil Wayne.
The Chili Peppers are back with their first album in five years. I’m With You is led by the single “The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie.” Already gaining massive airplay on alternative rock radio, “Maggie” rocks a heavy cowbell and classic Anthony Kiedis vocals over ’80s-inspired guitar riffs and steady kick-drums. Other standout album cuts include the static opener “Monarchy of Roses” and “Brendan’s Death Song,” which features highlights the Chili Pepper’s emotional side with a slower beat and earnest lyricism.
David Guetta has been getting flak from fans of his pre-One Love work. And this album will keep him in the doghouse. If anyone thought One Love was a sellout to mainstream pop listeners, wait till they hear this album. Featuring big name acts like Timbaland, Jennifer Hudson and Nicki Minaj, its hard to argue that this record is not trying to cater to Top 40 radio.
There is hope though. The beats on Nothing But the Beat are catchy and slick. Songs like “Titanium” featuring Australian pop artist Sia and “Lunar” with Afrojack are quality tunes that take Guetta’s mainstream dance sound to a respectable artistic level. The Jennifer Hudson track is a definite standout, if for no other reason than her flawless vocals and Guetta’s hypnotic production.
Lil Wayne has finally released Tha Carter IV after months of anticipation and setbacks. After a solid VMA performance to promote his new album, iTunes immediately released the album for digital resale. Standout tracks include “How to Love,” “6 Foot 7 Foot” featuring Cory Gunz, and “Its Good” featuring Drake and Judakiss.
The Bruno Mars collaboration is sure to take over pop radio and help propel the album to extraordinary first week sales. IV is already slated to gross more than $700,000 by week’s end. This Lil Wayne album lives up to the hype and expectations set after Tha Carter III. Though stand-alone singles like “Lollipop,” “Got Money” and “A Milli” are not present on this disc, the work as a whole is cohesive and sometimes thought provoking.
These three major releases should definitely be given a chance. I’m With You rehabilitates the Chili Peppers who have been absent of the late. Nothing But the Beat might not have the insightful lyricism of Weezy or the classic instrumental stylings of the Peppers, but it has some high profile names and catchy tunes. Lil Wayne’s Tha Carter IV is a tight listen, but begs the question of why Wayne thought he needed Bruno Mars to get on the radio.

Taylor Swift. Whether you hate her or love her, there is no denying the girl knows how to perform. The 20-year-old country-pop superstar kicked off the California portion of her “Speak Now” tour this past week with four consecutive sold-out shows at the Staples Center in LA Live.
The show, more of a performance than a concert, featured a full cast of actors/dancers/musicians, an elaborate fairy-tale set, glittering special effects, awe-inspiring surprise guests, and 10, yes 10, costume changes.
Swift inaugurated the show with a dazzling (literally, there were sparkles everywhere) performance of “Sparks Fly” from her new album, which immediately propelled the teenybopper crowd out of their seats and into a dance and sing along lasting the entire duration of the concert.
She followed with a selection of songs, all punctuated with moments of her innate quirkiness, from her latest album “Speak Now,” dotted with a few older favorites including “Our Song,” “You Belong with Me,” an encore rendition of “Love Story” and an acoustic version of “Fearless,” the title track from her previous album.
Swift was joined onstage by a full ensemble of exceptionally talented actors/dancers/musicians who acted out the “stories” in her tale-telling tunes. During “Speak Now,” the song about a girl (Madame Swift herself, in this scenario) who “rudely barges in” on the wedding of another woman to Swift’s own true love, the cast re-enacted a full wedding onstage. Of course, Swift, always the starry-eyed underdog in her songs, successfully convinced her Prince Charming to “not say a single vow” and run away with her. Shocking, really.
Despite the cliché inherent in the elaborate performances of her songs, they were fun to watch. The show was truly a glittering spectacle, and the energy and raw talent of each member of her cast, the star herself included, was captivating.
It just wouldn’t be a Taylor Swift concert without a few surprise twists along the way. During a transition between songs, a confused-looking Ellen DeGeneres suddenly popped up onstage and joined Swift onstage for one of her songs, playing the triangle and shaking maracas in true Ellen style.
Toward the end of the show, Swift delighted the crowd by bringing out Nicki Minaj, clad in an alarming amount of neon spandex, and performed an unlikely duet of Minaj’s hit song “Super Bass.” Swift’s previous guests for the week include Justin Beiber, Hot Chelle Rae and Jason Mraz.
For the young, die-hard Taylor Swift enthusiasts who constituted the majority of the audience, the concert was a dream come true. But even for those dragged along, there is something about seeing the young starlet perform live that makes her hard to hate.
Maybe it’s the disbelieving, doe-eyed expression on her face after every single song as she stares out into the screaming crowd. Maybe it’s the way she segues into songs with comments like “I love you LA. You guys are so nice, and I love nice people. You know what I don’t like? When people are Mean” (Cue the song: “Mean.”) Perhaps it’s her characteristic red lips, lucky number “13” drawn on her hand or iconic hair-flips that would rival those any sorority girl.
Whatever it is, Taylor Swift is a born performer, and her “Speak Now” show was nothing less than magical.

As the summer of sequels, blockbusters and billion-dollar franchises comes to a close, studios now look ahead to the fall festival circuit, a leading indicator of their films’ awards and commercial potential. Two of these festivals — Venice and Toronto — take place within the next few weeks and feature everything from period films to arthouse thrillers to passion projects from world-renowned directors.
Here is a rundown of the Venice and Toronto film festivals and the notable films they feature.
 
Venice Film Festival (August 30 – September 10)
A Dangerous Method
Canadian auteur David Cronenberg’s latest film details the complicated relationship between Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen) and Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) on the road to their respective breakthroughs in psychoanalysis. Also co-starring Keira Knightley as a disturbed patient, this film plays right into Cronenberg’s wheelhouse of dark, psychologically complex dramas. If critics respond favorably to it, look for this film to make a massive awards play in all the major categories.
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy
From Tomas Alfredson, the director of acclaimed Swedish thriller Let the Right One In, comes this adaptation of John Le Carre’s Cold War-era espionage novel that stars Gary Oldman as British spy George Smiley. When it is discovered that a Soviet mole resides within the British MI6, Smiley comes out of semi-retirement to uncover the spy. This film is already getting great buzz from people who have seen advanced screenings, which bodes well for its future awards chances.
The Ides of March
George Clooney directs, writes and stars in this adaptation of the stage play Farragut North that follows an idealistic campaign staffer (Ryan Gosling) who learns a hard lesson in political corruption when working for a budding presidential candidate (George Clooney). Clooney has proven himself as a triple threat when it comes to filmmaking (see: Good Night and Good Luck), and this political thriller could have major awards implications depending on audience and critical reaction.
Carnage
Exiled director Roman Polanski adapts the Broadway hit God of Carnage to the screen, detailing the conflict between two sets of parents after their sons get into a fight at school. The film boasts an impressive cast (Kate Winslet, Christoph Waltz, Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly) and shows a darkly comedic side of Polanski we have not seen before. Look for a major awards push for Polanski’s directing and writing, as well as the four performances if the film is well received.
 
Toronto International Film Festival (September 8 — 18) 
The Artist
One of the most interesting award-worthy films this year is newbie director Michael Hazanavicius’s chronicle of the rise and fall of a silent film star (Jean Dujardin). A silent, black-and-white film, it can be best described as A Star is Born meets Singin’ in the Rain. It was a major critical and audience hit when it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, so the buzz for this film will only grow stronger after it bows in Toronto.
Coriolanus
British thespian Ralph Fiennes makes his directorial debut in this reinterpretation of the Shakespeare classic. The film follows an exiled former war hero (Fiennes) who teams up with a sworn enemy (Gerard Butler) in order to take back the city that was one under his rule. Fiennes’s film is generating good word of mouth buzz, especially for his, Butler and Vanessa Redgrave’s performances.
The Descendants
George Clooney double-dips the festival circuit this year in his second starring role in Alexander Payne’s film about a Hawaiian landowner (Clooney) who tries to reconnect with his two daughters after his wife goes into a coma. Payne, best known for directing Sideways and About Schmidt, is a master at seamlessly meshing comedy with drama, and Clooney seems to be channeling his Oscar-nominated Up in the Air performance in this film, so keep an eye on this one as it also appears to be a major contender come awards voting time. 
Moneyball
Fresh off his Oscar win for his Social Network screenplay, Aaron Sorkin adapts the bestselling book that follows Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) as he teams up with a young mathematician (Jonah Hill) to create a successful baseball team with almost no money by utilizing an unconventional computer-generated analysis system when scouting players. Directed by Capote helmer Bennett Miller, this film benefits largely from Sorkin’s talent as a writer and is generating some early buzz among industry insiders.
