USC recorded its third consecutive win last night, beating the Pepperdine Waves, 5-2, on a windy night at Dedeaux Field.
Sophomore pitcher Bernardo Flores (3-0) earned his third win of the season after going five innings, allowing one run on two hits. Freshman Mason Perryman and sophomore Jeff Paschke came in from the pen and prevented the Waves from doing damage before junior Marc Hubberman closed the game with a one, two, three top of the ninth.
The Trojans continued their hot streak on offense with a two-run homerun by sophomore Jeremy Martinez in the bottom of the fifth as well as impressive outings from Dante Flores, who went 3-4, Blake Lacey, 3-4, David Oppenheim, 2-3 and Garrett Stubbs, who brought in two runs.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs echoes the success of last night’s win.
“I thought that [Bernardo] did a good job setting the tone and I thought we came up and swung the bats like we did last week,” Hubbs said. “I think we’re pretty relentless at the plate. I thought we had that same relentless offense today. Seeing Jeremy out there today was huge. I thought he had a great game.”
The Trojans got on board during the bottom of the second inning beginning with back-to-back singles by Dante Flores and Lacey followed by a walk for Oppenheim, loading the bases with no outs.  Waves’ starter Chandler Blanchard then walked red shirted sophomore Reggie Southall, bringing home Flores for the game’s first run.
Pepperdine answered back in the top of the fourth after a lead off walk and stolen base allowed Pepperdine’s speedy Hutton Moyer to score from a single down middle field. Flores then gave up an additional walk followed by a wild pitch to put men on second and third with two outs.
Flores regained composure, however, and managed to escape the inning after a pop up to second ended the top of the fourth. He then retired the next three batters during the top of the fifth to end his night, totaling four strikeouts and two walks.
USC then came away with the game during the fifth inning, putting three runs on the board and giving the Trojans a 5-2 lead. Senior Garret Stubbs started things off with a single before Martinez came up and smacked a two run homer out to left field, his first home run of the season, giving USC a 4-2 lead.
A string of singles by Dante Flores, Lacey and Oppenheim loaded the bases with one out, causing the Waves to bring in a new reliever. Freshman Joe Corrigan hit a sacrifice fly, bringing home Dante Flores for the fifth run. A wild pitch advanced the remaining runners to second and third before a strike out ended the fifth, marking the second time the Trojans ended an inning with the bases loaded.
Pepperdine threatened a comeback with the solo home run by Waves’ first baseman Brad Anderson as well as the subsequent walk, but Perryman handled the following to batters, squashing Pepperdine’s potential to put a crooked number on the board.
USC put up their final run in the eighth inning beginning with a lead off walk to Southall followed by a sacrifice bunt by AJ Ramirez and then a dropped third strike, advancing Stubbs to first. Though Southall was picked off trying to steal third, a single by Martinez eventually drove home Stubbs, earning the team their final run.
Looking ahead this week as USC travels to Seattle to take on Washington State, Hubbs believes the confidence earned from a solid, mid-week win will carry on to this weekend.
“I think any time you can take a Tuesday game is huge,” Hubbs said. “Those are really important games to take once you get towards the end of the year. When we play well, we’re in a position to win no matter who or where or when we play.”

Two months ago, Redshirt sophomore Connor Spears never would have imagined he would be thrust into his current situation. Coming into spring practice, the Trojans were set to have three tight-ends on the roster in returners Bryce Dixon and Jalen Cope-Fitzpatrick and redshirt Spears, with incoming freshman Tyler Petite. While the roster was thin, many felt that the Trojans would make it work with a three-headed attack in Dixon, Fitzpatrick and Petite.
Fast forward two months and Spears has found himself with the opportunity to grab the starting spot. The possible dismissal of Dixon and with Fitzpatrick ineligible, Spears is the only healthy tight-end on the roster. Not even USC predicted Spears would become a key part of their team. On their website, USC describes Spears “as a walk-on sophomore who will serve as a reserve tight-end in 2015.”
“It was a little crazy, coming in this spring; it was the biggest shock,” Spears said. “The situation just fell into my hands and I’m trying to make the most of it.”
After playing one year at Columbia University, Spears transferred to USC last spring as a preferred walk-on. Due to NCAA regulations, Spears was deemed ineligible and subsequently sat out the past season. This extra time allowed Spears to become acclimated to the USC program and work on some of his biggest issues: strength and blocking.
Standing at 6-foot-6, Spears is a towering force but he wasn’t always that way. In the three years since graduating high school Spears has added 50 pounds to his frame in hopes of easing the transition from Ivy league play to the Pac-12.
“It helped exponentially, being able to be on the scout team offense last year, where I was able to block guys like Leonard Williams and JR Tavai,” Spears said. “That level of competition helped me so much.”
Although he wasn’t expected to be a main part of this Trojan team, head coach Steve Sarkisian has taken notice of Spear’s hard work. The redshirt sophomore has made strides throughout this spring season and put in a really solid showing at practice on Tuesday.
“He’s got an unbelievable work ethic. He’s taken a bunch of reps and keeps fighting through it,” Sarkisian said. “He’s showing physicality, which was a concern coming in. But I just like his demeanor. Connor has had a good spring so far.”
With all the distractions surrounding him, Spears has done a great job of staying focused on improving his game.
News broke on Monday afternoon that former Oklahoma tight-end Taylor McNamara would be transferring to USC to add some depth. For now, however, Spears is focused on making the best of the opportunity in front of him.
“It’s pretty surreal. I’m not trying to think too much about it.” Spears said. “I’m trying to be like everyone else and just play football. Just block guys and catch passes.”

There’s always a minor sense of relief when the USC basketball team does not make the March Madness tournament. Obviously, I want to see USC in the tournament as much as any fan.
But when the Trojans aren’t in the mix, I feel a little more freedom while filling out my bracket. The times ‘SC has made the tournament, I always feel a little uncomfortable if I don’t pick USC as winner of a particular game. Picking USC almost feels like bad luck, but not picking them is definitely even worse.
So when they’re not even on the paper, I don’t have to deal with the existential fan crisis and can be a little less biased while trying to rationally predict the outcome of the tournament.
I’ve been entering the March Madness bracket competition on ESPN.com the last couple of years. It’s free to enter, and if I just so happen to be the one out of the million entrants to fill out the most accurate bracket, I would win $20,000. There’s no reason not to try.
My theory for the bracket is that if I am going to have any chance at winning that prize, something completely absurd has to happen and I have to randomly guess it. There’s no way I would win the pool if I picked, say, Kentucky to win it all and magically picked every other upset to happen perfectly. Way too many other people would have picked the top guys to finish in the Final Four, so I purposely go for a very unusual Final Four every time.
I also wholeheartedly believe that a mid-major is eventually going to win the tournament. Sure, the tournament recently has been dominated by powerhouses like Duke, UConn and Kentucky. But teams like Wichita State, Butler and Virginia Commonwealth have had a lot of success recently as well, and I think it’s only a matter of time before one of those little guys brings home the title.
The last two seasons, I picked Creighton, the tiny little Jesuit school out of Omaha, Nebraska, to win it all. The Bluejays were led by Doug McDermott, the national player of the year in 2014, so I thought they would be the best choice amongst the      mid-majors to pull it off. My grandpa also played basketball at Creighton way back in the day, so there was a little bit of personal bias behind those two picks.
The Bluejays unfortunately did not make the tournament this year; McDermott graduated and got drafted by the Chicago Bulls, and his alma mater went 14-19 without him. With both of my primary potential rooting interests out, I had to jump on a new bandwagon this month. So I opened up ESPN.com, went to the bracket page and thought to myself,  “Who is going to come out of nowhere to win it all?”
Northern Iowa.
I hadn’t really been paying much attention to the NCAA basketball regular season, so I was surprised to see this school I had never heard of as a No. 5 seed. It was love at first sight. I was ready to bet all of my marbles on these Wildcats. They would make it out of the relatively weak East regional, upset No. 1 seed Duke in the Final Four then finish off that Cinderella story with a 57-47 win against almighty, unbeaten Kentucky.
While filling out the rest of my bracket, I accidentally confused Northern Iowa with North Dakota State, a 15-seed out of the South regional, so I decided that they, too, would make the Sweet 16, but I had them losing to Duke before the Elite Eight.
Sure enough, North Dakota State got handily beat in the first round by Gonzaga, and while Northern Iowa looked very solid in its first round win against Wyoming, they were defeated by Louisville in the round of 32.
Bracket busted. Now that I’ve given up any real hope of winning the ESPN pool, I can watch the rest of the tournament without a real rooting interest and just pull for underdogs in all situations.
March is definitely still the most wonderful time of the year for sports fans, and this year’s addition of the March Madness tournament has been no exception so far after only one weekend.
But I’m still anxious to see the men’s team make a deep tournament run before I graduate. It’s both frustrating and disappointing to look at the Trojans’ season and see an eerily similar record to the year before. After going 2-16 in Pac-12 play last year with an 11-21 overall record, they went 3-15 in conference and 12-20 overall this season. One game at a time, though, right?
Nonetheless, coach Andy Enfield still has my vote of confidence, for now. It starts with recruiting, which he’s done well with so far, and that will eventually materialize into more victories. I’m not expecting as meteoric of a rise as the baseball team, but Enfield deserves the same patience and window of opportunity as Dan Hubbs, who appears to have turned the baseball program around for the long term after missing the playoffs his first couple of seasons.
I’m going to enjoy the rest of this year’s tournament, of course. My only rooting interest at the moment is that Gonzaga finally upends UCLA’s they-probably-shouldn’t-even-be-there-over-Murray-State run and avenges any of Adam Morrison’s old demons from the Bruins’ crazy comeback win over the Bulldogs in 2006 Sweet Sixteen.
But I’m already looking forward to next year’s. I sure hope the Trojans make it and I think they can.
I know it’s not the safe bet, but if they do make the tournament, you can bet I’m picking the Trojans to win it all in my bracket.

The women’s sand volleyball team is off to a hot start, maintaining a perfect 7-0 record and climbing the rankings to the top spot in the nation. After a weekend of play in Hawai’i against various teams, the Women of Troy bested No. 3 Pepperdine at home on Tuesday.
USC kicked off the season earlier this month with home wins against Texas Christian, Florida State and Loyola Marymount. Following the homestead sweep the team headed to Hawai’i over spring break and emerged unscathed.
The Women of Troy began the Hawai’i trip with a 5-0 win over the University of Hawai’i. The following day they beat Nebraska and California in a pair of 5-0 wins to stay undefeated.
The Queen of the Beach Challenge began the following day at the Queen’s Beach Sandbox on Friday. The first day of the Challenge was pool play, and four USC pairs advanced to the gold bracket. The pairs of Kelly Claes and Sara Hughes, Eve Ettinger and Meg Norton, Sophie Bukovec, Alexa Strange, Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler each went 2-0 in pool play to earn spots in the gold bracket.
Claes and Hughes won Pool B with a 21-10, 21-12 win over the mixed duo of Cal and Hawai’i. Claes and Hughes also defeated a Nebraska pair in straight sets, 21-5, 21-10. In Pool C, Ettinger and Norton claimed a pair of wins. The first came against Hawai’i, 21-17, 21-13. They then beat Nebraska, 21-9, 21-13.
In Pool F, Bukovec and Strange saw back-to-back straight-set wins with a 21-10, 21-8 victory over Cal, and a 21-15, 21-18 win against Hawai’i. Martin and Wheeler earned two wins in Pool G where they defeated Hawai’i, 21-14, 21-11, and then went on to a 21-11, 21-11 win against Nebraska.
The following day in bracket play, USC’s sophomore duo of Claes and Hughes won the Queen of the Beach crown. Claes also won the tournament’s Best Offense award. That marked  straight match wins for the pair, who has lost just one set during that run.
The pair faced a Hawai’i duo in the quarterfinals and produced a 21-18, 21-19 win to move into the semifinals where they had to go head-to-head with teammates Bukovec and Strange. Claes and Hughes prevailed with a 21-16, 21-14 win and eventually took out the Rainbow Wahine’s pair in the final, 21-19, 21-13.
Bukovec and Strange also won their pool and were pitted against the Women of Troy duo of sophomores Martin and Wheeler in the gold quarters. Bukovec and Strange won that matchup, 21-13, 21-18, before they fell to Claes and Hughes in the semifinals. The Women of Troy had a fourth pair in the gold quarterfinals. Seniors Ettinger and Norton lost in the quarters, 21-16, 21-19.
The Women of Troy returned home as the number one team in the nation, and put their perfect record on the line against No. 3 Pepperdine on Tuesday. USC won three of five three-set matches against the Waves.
The Women of Troy scored the first two points with wins at court four and five, respectively. Martin and Wheeler struck first with a 21-19, 21-16 win over Sophie Asprey and Taylor Racich at court four.
The USC duo of senior Bria Russ and freshman Jenna Belton fought back from a loss in the first set to tie the score with a 21-16 win in the second over a Pepperdine pairing. Belton and Russ came through with a 15-12 win in the third to give USC a 2-0 lead.
The Waves fought back and evened the score at 2 apiece, and the win was decided in the final match. Ettinger and Norton fell, 21-17, to the Waves in the first set, but won the second, 21-14. The duo continued to dominate into the third and completed their three-set win, 15-9, to seal the 3-2 dual victory for the USC.
At 7-0, the Women of Troy are off to the best start in program history. USC looks to maintain its perfect record on March 26 when it hosts Bakersfield (6-2) at 3 p.m. and Saint Mary’s College (3-4) at 4:30 p.m. Both matches will be broadcast live on the   Pac-12 Networks.
First USC was a Water Polo school, now it is Sand Volleyball leader. How many schools throughout the country have a women team? Great that the ladies are super at their sport, maybe they could help the Women Volleyball team get back to being a
contender.

SC Students for Israel and 12 other student organizations hosted a fundraising gala at Founders Park to benefit Seeds of Peace, a nonprofit and apolitical organization that promotes conflict resolution and mediation efforts. On Tuesday evening, individual student groups offered different activities to gain attraction among visitors.
Activities included a performance from Asli Baat, a South Asian a cappella group, making peace flags with the International Student Association, turban-tying with the Sikh Student Association and a camp song activity by Camp Kesem. The event also brought an Indian food truck whose proceeds went towards the fundraiser.
Seeds of Peace is a New York-based organization which recruits young individuals from conflict areas in the Middle East and South Asia to spend a summer in Maine participating in mediation workshops.
Maya Fried, co-president emeritus of SCSI and a senior double majoring in philosophy, politics, and law and creative writing, explained that SCSI chose Seeds of Peace as their beneficiary because the organization’s goals were inspiring.
“As an American nonprofit that brings Israeli, Palestinian, Indian, Pakistani and American refugee youth to a summer camp in Maine, Seeds of Peace is truly striving to be an all-encompassing organization when it comes to peace education and mediation,” Fried said.
Fried explained that Seeds for Peace camp allows youths to come together and view each other as equals.
“For many of these teenagers, Seeds of Peace camp is the first time they will come face to face with the ‘other’…The intent is to cultivate peace-minded individuals that can return to their homes and take on roles that will promote peace and equality,” Fried said.
All of the money raised at the gala will be donated to Seeds of Peace to help fund the organization’s summer camps. Fried also emphasized the apolitical nature of the fundraiser.
“This isn’t about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or the Indian-Pakistani conflict in isolation — it’s about all of the people in regions struggling for a semblance of quiet and safety, and it’s about the power that the youth in those places have for their futures,” she said.
Fried foresees a fundraiser of this nature becoming an annual event at USC, and she hopes more students groups get involved since some did decline.
“It is regrettable that neither the Palestinian nor the Pakistani group are cosponsoring the gala, an event we initially created in hopes of emulating how the organization itself bridges gaps between those communities in conflict. Unfortunately those groups at USC chose not to participate, but the success we’ve had joining with other organizations and hopefully will have at the event itself gives me hope that next year we can all come together for such a cause and truly put politics and otherwise aside for the premise of peace.”
Similarly, Shreya Sharma, a first-year computer science graduate student from India and the director of relations for the Association of Indian Students, reiterated how the event takes no political angle, something unexpected.
“It is really important for us to give out the right message. If the right message is not getting through, then this whole thing about us trying to achieve peace can actually do the opposite,” Sharma said.
Sharma noted that peace is especially attainable at USC because of its diverse demography.
“The sole message we want to leave to people is that we are all students studying at USC, which is the one of the most internationally diverse university in the world. Even if our countries are at war, we can make peace here,” Sharma said. “If we can set up an example of peace, we’re definitely aiding in the worldwide peace effort.”
The Unruh Institute of Politics also cosponsored the event. Dan Schnur, executive director of the institute, said that he hoped that the event would increase awareness and promote an open discussion among the student body.
“We want to help expose their work to a broader campus audience,” Schnur said. “Events like [the Seeds of Peace Gala] are perfect opportunities for students to realize that their differences are greatly outweighed by their common interests and goals.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that an a cappella group called Asli Beat performed at the event. The group is actually called Asli Baat. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and leaders in business, education, technology and philanthropy gathered at Town and Gown Tuesday morning for the National After-School Summit to discuss the importance of after-school programs which are in danger of funding cuts.
Congress is debating on cutting more than $1 billion dollars in federal funding for after-school programs.
The summit was sponsored by the USC Schwarzenegger Institute, Price School of Public Policy and  Afterschool All-Stars and Afterschool Alliance, a group of after school advocacy programs.
Schwarzenegger organized a similar event in 2003 when after-school funding was at risk.
Schwarzenegger said the Summit was created to keep after school programs alive and kids safe.
“We are here today to tell Washington as one voice, ‘Don’t terminate after-school programs,’” Schwarzenegger said. “After-school programs protect our single greatest resource, our kids. I have been passionate about after-school programs for the last 25 years and I think the reason is because I have seen first hand how kids go home from the schools after three o’clock and drift around on the streets and get into trouble.”
Schwarzenegger said that after-school programs provide many benefits, such as statistically higher graduation rates, a lesser chance of students committing crimes and more assistance with homework and fitness through sports and mentorship.
“It’s not just adult supervision, they are getting enriched in the arts, fitness through sports, homework assistance, tutoring and most importantly there are mentors there that really care for them,” Schwarzenegger said.
Christopher Steinhauser, superintendent of Long Beach Unified School District, said that after-school programs have helped schools within his district by improving attendance and decreasing overall suspension rates.
“The attendance is up, suspensions are down, crime in our city has hit a 41-year low and the most important thing: our kids are going to college,” Steinhauser said. “My kids are on the way to college and succeeding. More importantly than that, our young peoples parents are more involved than ever.”
Bonnie Reiss, global director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute, described the event as a “rally,” stressing it was a useful platform to showcase the importance of after school programs.
“Today is an opportunity to put a big spotlight on the value of after-school programs,” Reiss said. “It’s a simple truth, they work. After-school programs is the single best and most cost effective investment. They can be made in helping our kids succeed in school and life.”
Reiss explained that the programs were created to serve kids with backgrounds from low income, working families who are typically underrepresented minorities.
“We are here to be the champions of the 10 million kids in these programs and the 20 million others that don’t yet have a program,” Reiss said. “We are their voice and today is about sending that message.”
Dr. Rod Paige, U.S. Secretary of Education from 2001-2005, said after-school can be an unsafe time for students who don’t have proper support.
“Think about it carefully,” Paige said. “Think about what goes on between three and six in the afternoon for tons and tons of kids. One of the best ways we can spend our time is making sure kids come ‘home’ after school and they have some meaningful activity and some shelter.”
Schwarzenegger said after-school programs should not suffer because of America’s debt.
“When Congress talk about money and how they have to cut after school programs to make ends meet, I mean think about how ludicrous that sounds,” Schwarzenegger said.  “Do you think that it was after-school programs that dropped this country blind that we now have [tens of trillions of dollars in] debt? We have now $18 billion [in] debt in the past 6 years. They think after-school programs did that? Are they crazy? It’s mismanagement.”
Frank Fowler, Syracuse Police Department chief of police, said that a greater investment in after school programs could ultimately prove to be beneficial to the nation in the long run.
“We can no longer take for granted . . . that all of our young people have the same resources,” Fowler said. “Whatever we put inside of them is exactly what we are going to get out of them later on. We can no longer take this for granted. We have to invest in our young people . . .  and because it’s an investment, guess what? We’ll reap the benefits later. ”

Undergraduate Student Government President Andrew Menard delivered the State of USC Address to the USG Senate at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Tuesday night. The 20-minute speech recapped the accomplishments of USG’s different assemblies, but also touched on the various challenges USG faced throughout the year.
Menard described one challenge as the student body feeling a lack of transparency with the senior administration. He specifically noted an instance when President Nikias assembled his provost search committee without student involvement.
“One of the biggest universal concerns from the student body was the sentiment that the student voice has been lost,” Menard said. “From the start, I and the rest of my colleagues sought to establish a clear partnership between student government and administration.”
Menard also highlighted how issues of programming still persist. He explained that student organizations often feel the cumbersome effects of high costs on security and production.
“The Greek community feels unfairly restricted with the timing of when their events must end, and the limit of only four houses hosting events on Thursday and weekend nights, a decision by the way that was made without student input,” Menard said.
He continued to list many of USG’s achievements in advocacy, such as the changes made to the academic calendar, which extended the deadline to drop a class without a W from week three to week seven.
Other achievements included the renovation of Leavey Library, the clarification of the amnesty policy, the establishment of a free shuttle service during spring break, the development of an African American students’ house, the creation of a long-term mentorship program with local schools and the “Revamp Lyon” campaign that seeks to improve USC’s recreational facilities.
Menard then described various events held by Program Board during the 2014-15 year that drew large audiences and were popular among students.
“From comic sensation Stan Lee to the venerated civil rights activist Angela Davis, [Program Board] is helping to bring five Bovard events this year alone,” Menard said. “The [USC Concerts Committee’s] Welcome Back concert featured Norwegian phenoms Nico & Vinz in addition to electronic artist Robert DeLong, while Conquest was capped by collaborative sets from electronic-rock artist Phantogram and Grammy-award-winning rap legend Big Boi of OutKast.”
Menard explained how another set of campaigns organized by Program Board focused on sexual assault issues.
“Sexual assault and violence prevention have become an increasingly important issue on college campuses around the country, requiring a multifaceted approach,” Menard said. “USG joined President Obama’s national ‘It’s On Us’ campaign to raise awareness, education and prevention strategies around this issue. The Trojans Respect Consent campaign launched last October during the ‘National Week of Action’ and reflects an effort to present a consolidated approach to the issue.”
With regards to funding, Menard recapped the $1.50 per student increase in the student programming fee and the success of the funding boards. Menard explained that prior to the current administration, the Student Programming Fee remained at a fixed rate for six years, which he claimed placed a extensive strain on large events.
“The five funding boards … have provided over $315,000 in funding to students this year,” Menard said. “Not only do we continue to financially support iconic USC programming such as Dance Marathon and many culture shows, USG has also helped fund over 25 new student organizations and events.”
Menard concluded his address with USG’s future projects, highlighting the creation of a two-day fall break in October and the redesign of the fountain run. He addressed the highly debated fountain run event held for seniors during their spring semester before graduation.
“This has been a senior tradition for the past ten years that many Trojans have looked forward to,” Menard said. “However, due to increased 14 medical calls, laceration, outside and unwelcome visitors, sexual assault instances and extreme damages to campus and in particular to the fountain in the center of alumni park, totaling over $30,000 in damage, the University’s senior administration has made it clear that they will not allow a fountain run to occur this year,” Menard said.
Menard ended on the issue by explaining that the abolishment of the senior fountain run would result in adding an alternate interactive event for graduating seniors in order to continue to provide an interactive event for seniors graduating.
“If there can be no fountain run, then the best choice we have is to create an event that can rival the fountain run from an entertainment perspective, but mitigate the dangerous risks that thousands of students partying in fountains creates,” Menard said.
Editor’s note: This article previously stated that Menard discussed Program Board events from the 2015-16 school year. It was in fact events from the 2014-15 school year. The Daily Trojan regrets this error. 
Seems good, but I don’t understand the following “accomplishment:”  “…the development of an African American students’ house.” Please explain to me why that is not unfair racial segregation. Would a white students’ house be OK? No. This is an ugly step backward in social progress at USC.

It’s the third day of classes after spring break, and students might start to feel nostalgic for a time not so long ago when their meals consisted of light beer, corn chips, guacamole and salsa. They might drag their heels and begrudge that the California sunshine is not promising much more than additional midterms and five weeks until finals. If this is the case, then nothing will be more refreshing than recipes that could transport diners all the way back to their spring break locales.

As school resumes and spring break becomes a thing of the past, the very last of the spring breakers’ Facebook updates and Instagram posts trickle in—the posed beach photos, selfies by the beach and glossy updates from exotic vacation destinations. Admittedly, I have been increasingly guilty of updating my own social media accounts more when I go on vacation to share my wonderful experiences abroad. But especially during vacations, the “look what I’m up to” social media updates foster both insecurity and narcissism that plague our generation.
A York University study evaluated the post regularity and content of 18 to 25-year-old Facebook users against the Narcissism Personality Inventory, concluding a correlation between higher Facebook usage and narcissistic or insecure personalities. Part of the narcissism is intuitive: constantly streaming every aspect of our lives to everyone we’ve ever known is a pretty obvious sign of self-obsession.
But how do we know that social media has created narcissism, and not just self-empowerment? Certainly, the rise of the selfie has, especially for women, allowed a redefinition of beauty standards based on what actual people look like, revolutionizing the portrayal of women in the media. The fine line between what Nicki Minaj refers to as the self-love-driven “feelin’ myself” and true narcissism, however, lies in the intentions behind the behavior. For example, social media posts that increasingly glorify their accomplishments and experiences may be compensating for an underlying sense of insecurity. And the role that social media increasingly plays as an instrument for social comparison exacerbates this sense of insecurity.
Though, at some level, the desire to be liked is human, social media intensifies this desire by providing a new, constant mechanism for self-evaluation based solely on social comparison. Quantifying someone’s likeability — the number of Facebook likes on a profile picture, followers on Instagram, and retweets — all serve as the new form of social signals that validate self-worth based on outside sources. Social psychologist Leon Festinger calls the concept the social comparison theory, the idea that we determine our values and desires based on those of our peers. In a way, social media brings the immaturity behind the concept of high school popularity back to social relationships.
Social media as a form of social comparison also makes insecurity more vulnerable because of constant barrage of exciting updates. The recently emerged phenomenon of “fomo,” or “fear of missing out,” encapsulates the concept: both the consistency of social media updates and the urge to check social media guarantees an almost constant “fomo” of more exciting experiences that uniquely plagues our Internet-addicted generation.
We must, then, grapple with social media’s unique insecurities and narcissistic qualities that will surely shape our personalities and relationships. It is not realistic to simply unplug; for many, refraining from social media is simply not possible when a large part of personal and professional relationships are shared online.
But perhaps, if we gain a more cohesive understanding about the implications of social media, we can work to create more meaningful social media updates and, as conventional wisdom holds, we can refrain from comparing our lives to someone’s highlight reel — literally.

Sorry, Meghan Trainor, but it’s really not “all about that bass” — in fact, the problem many people have with the singer is not her curvy figure but the content of her music. The latest controversy surrounding Trainor centers on the new music video for “Dear Future Husband,” a track off her debut album, Title. The 1950s-inspired melody is admittedly catchy, but the mid-20th century influence goes beyond aesthetics. The song has come under fire over the past week for its reaffirmation of heteronormative gender roles and for its picture of marriage as a transaction.
Sexism in pop music is far from a new issue, but in the wake of the past year’s explosion of celebrity feminism, Trainor stands as a blatant opponent to gender equality in the media. After all, it was common in 2014 for reporters to ask celebrities whether or not they consider themselves feminists that Time included the word “feminist” on its list of words to be banned for the following year. And let’s not forget that the magazine received so much backlash for this inclusion that the editor wound up removing “feminist” from the list.
With gender equality in the limelight, the existence of a music video for “Dear Future Husband” seems unfathomable. Indeed, it’s hard to imagine that Meghan Trainor, who appears in the video as a demanding, hyper-sexualized housewife, exists in the same realm as Emma Watson or Beyoncé. Even the one seemingly feminist line in the entire song — “You got that 9 to 5/ But, baby, so do I/ So don’t be thinking I’ll be home and baking apple pies/ I never learned to cook/ But I can write a hook” — winds up eclipsed by contradictory lyrics and that particular video clip. XOJane points out that during this “fleeting lyrical moment of women’s lib,” we see Trainor “scrubbing a kitchen floor with no indication of irony.” The rest of the song and video is blatantly sexist, painting women as hysterics who are too demanding to enjoy sex but willing to barter their bodies for presents, compliments and their husbands’ total deference. Men are the brutish breadwinners, desperate to please their wives in exchange for carnal pleasure. In this way, Trainor’s grossly stereotyped vision of America echoes common misconceptions of feminism — the demanding woman withholding sex and subjecting the inferior male to her wrath.
Unfortunately, this nightmare vision of female empowerment is nothing unusual from Trainor.  On the surface, “Dear Future Husband” and “All About That Bass” seem to be catchy girl-power anthems, but Trainor is notorious for grossly misunderstanding female empowerment and body love. “All About That Bass” features a line calling out “skinny b-tches,” followed by the weak apology, “No, I’m just playing, I know you think you’re fat.” Somehow, elevating your own body image by putting down other women and making light of eating disorders doesn’t seem that acceptable to me. Plus, both “Dear Future Husband” and “All About That Bass” suggest that a woman’s value lies in her appeal to the opposite sex — not in her own self-acceptance. Bearing this in mind, it comes as no surprise that Trainor has explicitly rejected the label “feminist” in a 2014 interview featured in Billboard.
Maybe it seems silly to assign so much value to one pop singer’s career, but Trainor isn’t just your average celebrity. Her reputation for promoting body-positivity and her lyrical embrace of her own figure have pinned her as a role model for American youth. Mic writer Kate Beaudoin points out that Trainor’s latest hit “may be ‘just a pop song,’ but thousands of little girls will be singing ‘Dear Future Husband’ on the playground soon enough.” After all, the scariest part of “Dear Future Husband” lies in its power to undo feminist efforts by snaking its way into young, impressionable minds. Beaudoin goes on to state, “This song teaches kids that men are born to be husbands and women are born to be wives,” and that’s no way to accomplish gender equality.
Thankfully, there is hope. The sheer number of Twitter criticisms and articles published in response to this particular video is proof that culture has dramatically evolved from the 1950s. Sexism doesn’t sit with American society quite like it did in the past, and Trainor isn’t the only media figure with something to say about female empowerment. As long as there are those unafraid to protest, feminism is here to stay.

Before I packed my bags and set off on my semester-long Parisian adventure, I did what almost every student who is about to go abroad does: I read a Buzzfeed article about studying abroad.
In my case, the post was titled, “43 Reasons Studying Abroad In Paris Destroys You For Life.” Contrary to how the headline sounds, the post aimed to highlight all of the amazing things about studying abroad in Paris, from its incredible cuisine to its picturesque city streets, and how such things make it almost impossible to ever live life the same way again. In short, it set some pretty high expectations for the city of lights, and it was only until after I arrived in Paris in late January that I was able to realize how on-point the post really was. With Paris’s rich history and unmatched beauty (rain or shine — though mostly rain), it didn’t take long to fall in love with the city.
But in all the ways the post is right about life in Paris, there were some things about the Parisian experience that it fails to capture.
1. You’re not a perpetual tourist.
Don’t let your friends’ Instagram and Snapchat posts fool you — study abroad isn’t all fun and games. Behind all the captured moments of touristy excursions, delicious meals and well-timed selfies, there is some serious cultural immersion taking place. For some students, this means adapting to living alone in a new city. For others, this means adjusting to life as the newest member of your host family. Whether it’s figuring out how to best maneuver around your new city or simply becoming a regular at your local patisserie, achieving a daily routine is the ultimate mark of an immersed study abroad student.
2. Despite all the fun and traveling, it’s still study abroad.
Studying in a foreign country definitely takes on a different form than what one might be used to. Just as one still has to attend class (the only difference, of course, being that sometimes your classes are held in museums — c’est la vie), you still have to account for midterms, projects and final papers.
What’s more, the learning doesn’t stop once you leave the classroom. In fact, I’ve found that some of my most challenging lessons of study abroad have appeared in places where I’d least expect them to, such as on the streets of Paris. Every metro ride becomes a lesson in French social norms (Lesson one: You should be quiet on the metro), every purchase is a lesson on handling European currency, and every dinner with my French family is a pop quiz on the news of the day. It’s a perpetual learning process.
3. Study abroad is more than just transferring one’s studies to a foreign country — it’s a cultural sabbatical.
Regardless of where you choose to study abroad, you’re ultimately going to find yourself facing a culture completely foreign to your own. Though some things like language barriers and different eating habits are easier to anticipate, other more subtle cultural differences — such as how to tip at a restaurant or even something as simple as finding cafes that offer coffee to-go — can be a bit more challenging. But rather than framing the culture shock as a hurdle to overcome, one can just as easily view it as a unique opportunity to experience a lifestyle completely different from his or her own. And if you’re a fan of two-hour lunch breaks like the Parisians are, that sort of thing might not be so bad.
4. You’re going to constantly be outside of your comfort zone, and you should embrace it.
Half the fun of studying abroad is learning how to become comfortable with the previously uncomfortable. Whether it’s finally figuring out how to get around town without asking for directions, or even something as simple as speaking in your host country’s native language without having them respond to you in English (a huge feat if you’re dealing with a language barrier), there’s nothing more gratifying than feeling more at home in your study abroad city.
5. You only study abroad once.
To paraphrase the ever-popular “you only live once” cliche, your study abroad experience is truly a once-in-a-lifetime deal. And though you can always visit your city again, the fact of the matter is that your experience living and studying in your host city is unlike anything you’ll likely ever experience again. So in the spirit of Paris’ famed singer Edith Piaf, ne regrette rien.

USC alumna Summer Moore wrote, produced and stars in 2015 found-footage horror flick The Warning, a tale of an ambitious young woman who becomes trapped in the dangerous world of the occult.
The plot follows Taylor Skye (Moore), a journalist seeking to get ahead in the competitive business of the TV world. While investigating a local myth surrounding the occult and several missing people, she finds herself becoming the victim at the hands of satanic individuals. Despite the thrilling plot line, the heroine proved close to home for this USC alumna.
For Moore, Skye’s character seemed to be an easy adaptation.
“She’s a strong-willed and opinionated woman — very much like me,” she said.
Moore describes how this found — footage film proved to be very different from other types of filming styles she has worked with before. For actors, found footage presents an elevated challenge since scenes have to be shot from beginning to end with no mistakes, says Moore. In traditional filming, you have more liberty to edit around “mess ups,” but this style doesn’t allow for extensive editing within the scenes without breaking the illusion of the found footage. This means that the actors have to be focused and on their game through every shot.
Not only was the filming different, but the story is based on actual events that happened in “the occult capital of the western world,” according to Moore.
“This was probably my favorite part of the film, that we were working around some very real situations, things that actually happened to people,” she said.
Moore also loved shooting on location in Colorado, where she grew up and a place close to her heart.
Moore not only starred in the film, she also wrote and produced the entire feature on her own, but she said that creating the film was no easy feat.
“I now know never to produce a full feature by myself again,” she said.
She also learned about the importance of budget in filming. The Warning was a micro-budget film that Moore said taught her a lot about being resourceful while under budget constraints. With no funds to pay others to do many of the jobs, Moore took on the responsibility of not only the huge workload of actress, producer and writer, but also sound design, location scouting and casting. This knowledge of finances and production, Moore said, will make her future work in a studio or projects with many people, an easier process, though she admitted she is used to doing everything by herself.
Despite her long career in the entertainment industry, Moore wasn’t always prepared for the challenges.
“Many people don’t understand all the work that goes into being a producer. I didn’t even know what I was getting myself into,” Moore said.
Despite the obvious challenges of such an ambitious endeavor, Moore said she appreciated working on the project. Moore said her knowledge of the difficulty of the entertainment industry has inspired her to help students and unknown talent reach their career goals.
In addition to producing and directing The Warning, she also has extensive experience within the entertainment industry. She has written and produced several other projects such as short films such as the Karma of Happiness and Peace and Quiet. On top of these credits, she is in the process of writing and publishing a book.
As an USC alumna, Moore attributes some of her success to USC and the connections the school provided for her. She said she has landed jobs on commercials simply because she was a USC alumna. Being part of the Trojan family also helped her early on when she took classes through the theater program.
“I remember taking a dialect class and an Auditioning for the Camera class, which was really helpful since auditioning for theater and film is a very different process,” she said.
In May, the USC Alumni Association will host a screening of her film — an event that Moore notes as continued support from the Trojan family.
“USC is an awesome school and I am so proud that I am still a part of it,” she said.

Last week, Starbucks introduced its Race Together campaign, a year-long initiative also led  by USA Today that will promote discussion and action around race in Starbucks stores, open houses and local communities. The campaign began with a highly publicized and controversial portion, in which Starbucks baristas were given the option to write the words “race together” on their customers’ cups to stimulate dialogue about race if the customers wanted. Though that segment ended on March 22, it raises many questions about Starbucks’ plans for the rest of its Race Together campaign, and whether they will have any meaningful impact on race relations in America.
So far, Starbucks has publicly announced that it will host open dialogues between police and community leaders across the country, run several open forums for employees, commit to hiring 10,000 opportunity youth over the next three years and co-produce three more special newspaper sections with USA Today. Of those, the special newspaper supplement sounds like it has the most potential to make an actual impact, as it can introduce a new perspective to a large readership. Starbucks has already co-produced one USA Today supplement that was distributed for free at its stores this weekend. The supplement included a diversity index, which shows the increasing probability that the next person one met would be of a different race; as well as race-related conversation starters and questions, such as “How have your racial views evolved from those of your parents?
That being said, newspaper supplements can only accomplish so much, and it is programs such as those allowing baristas to write “race together” on customers’ cups that truly stir up the public — without that phase of the program, the Race Together campaign wouldn’t have gotten the attention it did, and the many online discussions about how race relations should be addressed certainly wouldn’t have happened.
Opponents of the barista participation point out that a Starbucks shop is the wrong environment to discuss an issue as complex as race. Danielle Henderson of Fusion TV said, “It’s the height of liberal American idealism and a staggering act of hubris to think we can solve our systemic addiction to racism over a Frappucino.” Former NBA star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar likewise noted that Starbucks CEO and Chairman Howard Schultz “picked the wrong venue with the wrong audience using the wrong spokespersons,” though he praised Schultz for having the courage to attack an issue as complex as race in his company.
Whether or not the campaign affected the dialogue on racism isn’t the central issue. What matters is that the event brought national attention to Starbucks’ campaign and allowed Starbucks to plan further events that address the issue of race relations in America. Schultz acknowledged this when he said, “Writing on the cup is a de minimis piece of this issue. And it’s not something that’s going to last long. It was a catalyst to start this.”
Starbucks’ Race Together campaign has gotten off to an interesting start, one that has been as polarizing as it has been publicized. Hopefully, Starbucks has other plans to directly address race in a more effective way and to take advantage of the widespread attention now surrounding Race Together and its cause. In starting this campaign, Starbucks has prepared the public for future social issues campaigns from Starbucks and set an example that other socially responsible companies should definitely follow.

Over the past weekend, Insomniac’s brilliant mastermind Pasquale Rotella hosted Beyond Wonderland at the San Manuel Amphitheater in San Bernardino, bringing in more than 60 DJs and 70,000 attendees. The festival was held on March 20 and 21, coinciding perfectly with spring break season. It thoroughly utilized the renowned outdoor music venue through placement of four different stages to cater to all types of music lovers.
On top of an impressive selection of some of the most accomplished acts in music, Insomniac truly delivered on the festival experience with their selection of activities. One-of-a-kind art installations, such as giant mushroom and other Alice in Wonderland artifacts, were placed all around the venue. Enigmatic characters dressed to emulate the Alice in Wonderland vibes walked all around the venue for photo-ops with enthusiastic fans. Numerous food trucks awaited hungry festival-goers as the night went on well past midnight. In addition, Beyond Wonderland offered a dedicated campsite complete with arts and crafts, yoga, fishing and even a silent disco.
Here’s a look at several artists from the first and second days of the festival:
Day 1:
Andrew Rayel: This artist was definitely the highlight of the night as the night raged on at the Mad Hatter stage. The images on the screen were captivating as the lights and LEDs moved in rhythm with the music. Ravel knew how to cater to the crowd, and commanded attention as all focus was on him. He played crowd favorites such as Zedd’s “Clarity” and Calvin Harris’ “Under Control.” Within his one and a half hour set, he led the crowd to a new level of friendliness, surrounding each other with energy free of bias, prejudice, and hatred.
GTA: This group ended the first day of nonstop EDM music. As this American duo performed songs ranging from a remix of “One Two Step” to various trap songs, laser beam lights flickered through falling white confetti. The artists strategically utilized their time to build up the audience in order to achieve an unconventionally slow, down-tempo drop that mesmerized the audience and kept them on their feet jumping from beginning to end.
Day 2:
Party Favor: L.A. native Dylan Ragland, more commonly known as Party Favor, took the main stage in broad daylight with a devoted audience jumping through the heat as he played some crowd favorites such as “I Don’t F-ck With You” and “This is How We Do It.” The crowd went wild singing along to these songs, especially when he proclaimed that “west coast is the best coast”. And when he played “All I Do Is Win,” heads nodded to the hard beat.
Hardwell: The audience filled the large arena when Hardwell took the stage, playing songs that everyone could sing along to, including Alesso’s “Heroes,” David Guetta’s mashup of “Dangerous,” and Calvin Harris’ “Blame.” His set was definitely a crowd-pleaser. As he played “Cinema” and “Arcadia,” fans screamed at the top of their vocal cords. This Dutch DJ never fails to exhilarate the crowd with his electro house music.
Insomniac’s next festival in the area will be EDC Las Vegas, held at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway from June 19 to 21.

Hardwell and GTA were awful. People were pouring out of that stage. This editorial needs to hire people who actually attend festivals more than once a year. It doesn’t take any talent to write about the mainstream artists who half-ass their sets. Writing about artists such as Sub Focus, Lookas, Andy C, and Slander actually indicates that you don’t jump on the bandwagon of big namers and shows that you have actual festival experience. Anyone who has been to more than 3 festivals knows the difference between a good set and a truly special set.

When you’re traveling overseas, you need to be able to understand conversion rates.
As a study abroad student entering her third month overseas, I’ve found this fact to be undeniably true.
In the United States, the dollar reigns supreme. Before coming to London, I never thought about exchanging my money because our country is so vast. In Europe, however, where dozens of countries with different currencies bump up against one another, it’s important to make sure you know which currency a country takes and how that compares to the U.S. dollar.
This past week I was in four different cities, several of them with varying currencies. In London, you pay in pounds. In Dublin and Athens, you pay in euros. Then there’s Turkey — and I’m not exactly sure what currency they use because I didn’t buy anything during my layover in the Istanbul airport. But it’s different than the dollar.
One of the biggest barriers students say they have when studying abroad is funding their semester. London, which is a popular destination for many students (because we can still speak English), is notoriously expensive. One pound equals $1.50. Therefore, a quick dinner for takeaway that costs ₤8 adds up to almost $12. And before you know it, all those U.S. dollars you’ve been saving up to pay for study abroad have dwindled away.
Despite its cost, a mainstay benefit of studying abroad in London is that it’s so close to countries that use a currency with a closer conversion rate to the dollar. The euro, which is the official currency of 19 countries in the Eurozone, is a lifesaver when studying abroad. One euro amounts to $1.08. A few weeks ago, the euro and U.S. dollar almost reached parity after the exchange rate fell sharply. During my trips to Ireland and Athens this past week, I used the euro to pay for my housing, meals and souvenirs.
Because the euro and dollar are so close, I was able to fully grasp how much I was paying for my items and budget more effectively. The different currency rates definitely encouraged me to travel outside of the U.K. more, and I’m considering it as an open invitation to broaden my worldview, which is essentially the point of study abroad programs.
So as I continue my journey abroad (and if you are considering undertaking your own), I will be sure to not only use my conversion app on my iPhone and make sure my bank account stays balanced, but also to never let currency prevent me from traveling across as many countries as I can while collecting souvenirs and memories along the way.
