RJ Mitte, one of the stars of the AMC show Breaking Bad, spoke to students and faculty on Monday evening in the Salvatori Computer Science Center. The discussion, Breaking Barriers with RJ Mitte, focused on Mitte’s disability and how he uses his career to advocate for equality.
The event was sponsored by the Political Student Assembly.
Mitte played the character Walter “Flynn” White Jr., who suffers from cerebral palsy in the hit TV show Breaking Bad. In the show, Mitte is the son of a cancer-diagnosed chemistry teacher who produces and sells methamphetamine to help his family financially before he dies.
When Mitte was 3 years old, he was diagnosed with mild cerebral palsy. Mitte moved to Los Angeles in 2006 because his sister was recruited for a role in a film project. Mitte jokingly said that he started to take acting lessons because if you’re in L.A. and you’re not in school, in a gang or acting, you probably won’t meet friends.  About six months later, he auditioned for Breaking Bad and got the part.
Mitte said his cerebral palsy doesn’t hold him back.
“I really don’t see [cerebral palsy] as a [hindrance],” Mitte said. “I see it as a strength. I see it as knowledge. There [are] so many things that come into effect when you’re in this industry and the more you have the better, I find. Yes, it can look hindering, but to me, it’s not.”
Mitte said individuals need to stop letting fear stop them from doing things.
“The main thing I’ve been really trying to get across when I do these speeches is not allowing yourself to be manipulated by fear,” Mitte said.  “At the end of the day, we are able to do anything we want. We have the power. We have the knowledge. We have the ability as human beings to be very resilient and not give up.”
Mitte said people should always take the opportunity to create social change.
“When you have an opportunity to change something that’s bigger than yourself and you have people that will listen and seem to like what you have to say and seem to understand … I think it’s important to do it,” Mitte said.
According to Mitte, individuals need to change the way they perceive others.
“One of the most important things that we have to do is change the mindset of how we perceive people, not just with disability — but people in general — because you have a lot of people that perceive the wrong thing and that’s not what you need,” Mitte said. “They see the crutches; they see the chair; they don’t look at who that person is. That’s not what I see when I see someone; I see them and then I see an extension.”
Breaking Bad helped Mitte become more involved with helping others and changing mindsets.
“[Breaking Bad] gave me a career and my career changed my life,” Mitte said. “I’m lucky that I’m able to do what I do. There are so many people in my position that don’t get these opportunities. No matter what, I would always be working with organizations and nonprofits, but this has allowed me to amplify that and to unfold and bring awareness to certain things that really need to be brought attention to.”
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Breaking Bad was a show on HBO. It was actually a show on AMC. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

A team of MBA students from the Marshall School of Business won top honors this weekend at the Stanford Graduate School of Business’ annual Challenge for Charity competition.
Marshall’s delegation of 220 students raised over $235,000 and completed 5,300 volunteer hours. This year’s competition marks the sixth year in a row that the Marshall team has won the competition.
Started 30 years ago at Stanford University, C4C is a nonprofit organization with active chapters at eight top business schools on the west coast, including USC, Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley and the University of Washington. C4C works to develop leadership in the business field but also commitment to the community and social responsibility. At USC, C4C is the largest student-run organization in Marshall, and this year, the chapter held more than 90 events during the academic year.
The competition’s top award, the Golden Briefcase, is awarded to the school that achieves the highest score in total hours volunteered (40 percent of score), money raised (40 percent of score), and performance in sporting events at the C4C weekend (20 percent of score). The Marshall team received first place in both sports and fundraising and second place in volunteering events.
All C4C chapters collaborate to raise funds for the Special Olympics, the primary beneficiary of C4C since its creation. Additionally, each chapter selects two additional partner charities from their surrounding communities. This year, the Marshall C4C team supported Junior Achievement of Southern California and A Better LA, a nonprofit started by Pete Carroll.
Aaron May, a student in Marhsall’s full-time MBA program, serves as co-president alongside fellow MBA students Gregory Woodburn, Lisa Horii, Robert Needham, Jordan Selva and Keahn Gary and led a board of 75 members.
“What I really love about C4C is how it shows that the students in this program really care about each other and the community that we’re a part of … It complements our curriculum and our careers,” May said. “It gives us the ability to look outside our walls and realize that there’s a lot more out there than financial statements and marketing. There are plenty of ways that we can give back to our community using the skills that we have acquired in Marshall.”
After he graduates in a few weeks, May plans to continue working on a company he created with classmate Mike Koranda a year ago. The company, Pacific Issue, creates custom-tailored shirts for men and received $25,000 through a crowdfunding campaign.
“It’s great to see that my classmates care about giving back to the community in these ways. It’s amazing for me to be a part of it and lead the charge,” Gary said . “It’s incredible when you think of how much money we raised, especially if you compare it to the amount we raised last year when we set a record at $202,000. It’s crazy. It’s amazing what our two MBA programs — full-time and part-time — can do when we get behind a common purpose and a mission.”
Woodburn came to Marshall with a background in the nonprofit sector. He was attracted to C4C as an opportunity to further explore his passion and skills in philanthropy. Woodburn will be working for the Clinton Foundation next year.
“The intersection of business and philanthropy really resonated with me when I first learned about the program after being admitted to USC Marshall for business school … We have a lot of people moving to Southern California from across the country or the other side of the world. C4C has been a great way for them to learn that giving back is a huge value here at USC, especially at Marshall,” said Woodburn. “Our three pillars are Career, Curriculum and Community, and we think those are really the attributes that build the whole experience here … We get to take the lessons we’re learning in the classroom about organizational culture or operations and build those skills in the community realm also. I got to work with great people doing the work that I love.”
Over the last six years, Marshall MBAs have raised over $1 million for charity through the C4C program.
Correction: A previous version of this story stated that the team won first place in volunteering and fundraising and fourth place in sports. The team actually won first place in fundraising and sports and second place in volunteering. The Daily Trojan regrets the error. 
We stood first in sports and fundraising. Not in hours . Univ of Washington was first in that category.

On Monday, Nicole Byer, breakout star of MTV’s Girl Code, visited USC for a night of comedy and discourse. The event called, Pursuit of Sexiness, featured a 30-minute stand-up performance, 30-minute interview and a 30-minute Q&A session. Byer discussed topics ranging from personal character to womanhood.
The event held in Seeley G. Mudd, was hosted by Speakers Committee and was free to all USC students and faculty members.
Byer had audiences laughing with her unfiltered, quote-worthy opinions and commentary that have made her stand out on Girl Code. The show is driven by female comics who dole out tips and start dialogues on the trials and tribulations of millennial womanhood.
“I was coming back from an improv tour and I made really good friends with the flight attendant on JetBlue, and he just took my purse and threw vodka in it and I was like, ‘Gotta get it started’, so I kind of went to the audition really drunk and I guess they were like, ‘She’s a mess let’s take it,’” Byer said of auditioning for the show.
Though Byer is best known for appearances on Girl Code, the actress and writer has been featured on 30 Rock, Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and Chelsea Lately. Byer, a native of New York City, relocated to Los Angeles to fulfill her career as a comedian.  She currently performs sketch comedy and improvisation with the Upright Citizens Brigade. She has also been in several different web series, including The Pursuit of Sexiness, which she co-created with SNL’s Sasheer Zamata.
“Because I was good at nothing else,” Byer laughed about how she got her career in acting and comedy started. “My mother was like ‘you talk a whole bunch, go audition for the play,’ and then I did it and then people started laughing and I was like, ‘this is for me.’”
From roasting Halle Berry for her role as Storm in the X-Men franchise to finding homeless people in L.A. “very attractive” nothing was off-limits for the comedian, even offering relationship advice to crowd members.
When asked how to let a guy know your interested in him without coming off as too “thirsty,” Byer shot back. “Is she just trying to ‘get the D’, or like a relationship? If she wants a relationship, you just drop subtle hints and if he doesn’t bite it means he doesn’t want it.”
Byer became more serious when asked if she found making fun of herself with fat jokes to be intentionally body positive and inspirational to women, during audience Q&A.
“I like the body I have right now, maybe sure, one day I’ll want to change it, but for now I love who I am, so I think it’s good for women of all body types to hear people say, ‘I’m okay. I love me. This is good for now, maybe in the future I’ll change, maybe not – maybe I’ll eat all the cookies every god damn day,” Byer said.

Coachella is a tall order for the average college student. It often requires spending hundreds of dollars on the ticket alone. Unfortunately, the expenses do not end there. They also include food, the cost of accommodations and any miscellaneous fun an attendee might want to join in on. Even with its exorbitant price tag, however, Coachella continues to attract the masses with its star headliners, crazy parties and California-cool reputation.
Here’s a rundown of the Weekend Two highlights:
The best headliner without a doubt, was AC/DC. On Friday, they performed with the kind of precision, musical integrity and sense of humor that is rare to find among studio-focused musicians nowadays.
AC/DC shared Friday with another big name, Nero, whose light show alone could have had its own set. Smaller must-sees included the fun and soulful pop artists Kiesza and Lykke Li, as well as the innovative funky beats coming from DJ Todd Terje and the Olsens.
Saturday belonged less to the headliners and more to the smaller acts. Even though it was blisteringly hot, festival attendees made it a mission to attend acts like hip-hop duo Run The Jewels, who pulled Travis Barker onstage to drum for them, and Deorro, the ever humble house DJ who tore down the Sahara tent Saturday evening.
“I had the opportunity this year to give a positive message,” Deorro said. “So I wanted to use this opportunity to speak to a bigger crowd and show them the positive things I live for, like family and music, that brought me to where I am today on this stage. They know that I’m here for them and then we were ready to party.”
Sunday featured an eclectic lineup that kept festival goers on their feet for most of the day, running back and forth across the Empire Polo Club grounds to catch all of the different acts. Even with a broken foot, Florence and the Machine put on a spellbinding performance and brought tears to some festival-goers’ eyes. In addition, Kaskade, Marina and the Diamonds, Duke Dumont and Stromae all gave incredible performances. Stromae’s Euro beats were keeping the crowd in a frenzy even before he brought Kanye West on stage to perform “Alors on Danse,” a guest appearance that propelled Stromae’s set into the history books.
Another highlight was the Do LaB, an EDM tent on the opposite side of the fields from the main stage that kept DJs playing in a steady rotation for more than 12 hours each day.
Though Coachella is the quintessential California music festival, it is certainly not the only one this summer.
If a festival grounded in EDM, yoga, art and sustainability sounds intriguing head to Bradley, California for Do LaB’s Lightning in a Bottle Arts & Music Festival this May. The idea for Lightning in the Bottle grew organically and collaboratively from some of Do LaB’s founding members.
“Some of our friends were musicians, artists, some liked to do lighting,” said Do LaB publicist Russell Ward. “It just grew from us wanting to create something that let us do all of that.”
Lightning in a Bottle’s star-studded line up includes ODESZA and Flume, as well as EDM powerhouse RL Grime. Tickets for this unique festival start at $260.
If trippy vibes and clean camping out in the desert do not sound appealing, BottleRock in Napa Valley is also a great spring festival option. Headliners include Imagine Dragons, No Doubt, Snoop Dogg, Robert Plant and Passion Pit. A little bit more like Coachella in flavor, BottleRock tickets go for $275, $100 less than face value Coachella tickets.
Another fun festival up north is Northern Nights in Piercy, California. Headliners include Autograf, Awesome Tapes From Africa and Basecamp. Northern Nights is for you if the idea of sharing space with hundreds of thousands of other people causes you anxiety. A smaller festival, Northern Nights features a beach stage that allows guests to float in a river while listening to their favorite artists and one of the most majestic campgrounds on the festival circuit.
And the options don’t end there. From jazz to country to dance to rock, from coast to coast there is a festival for every type of music fan. All it takes to find the perfect one is a little bit of research and maybe more than a little bit of money.

After capturing Pac-12 team championship with an undefeated season, No. 2 Women of Troy will travel to Ojai, California to compete in the individual Pac-12 tournament, which will take place from April 21 through April 25. This tournament’s format differs slightly as USC will be competing individually to win the Pac-12 singles and Pac-12 doubles titles.
“You’re not playing for your team anymore,” sophomore Zoë Katz said. “You’re still wearing your uniform though, and excited next to your teammates.”
The team is not concerned about the sudden change in dynamic. Competing individually is something all of the girls have done, and most of them are used to playing against girls that they know or are friends with.
“We kind of know how to switch on and off that competitive and friend relationship,” Katz said.
Though the players will be competing individually, they still want to represent their school and their team as well as they can.
“Everybody wants to do well there,” freshman Gabby Smith said. “I think everybody is thinking about the team in the back of their mind and everyone just wants to play good tennis.”
The Pac-12 is an extremely competitive conference and as such, the Women of Troy will face significant opposition throughout the duration of the tournament.
The highest-ranked doubles team for USC is the tandem of senior Zoë Scandalis and junior Giuliana Olmos who are ranked No. 17 overall. The two have combined for a 14-6 record.
On the singles side of play, two players have cracked the top 25. Olmos is the top Trojan with a national ranking of No. 13. Just behind her is Santamaria. The former No. 1 player has been steadily climbing the rankings following a season-ending injury last year. She is currently ranked No. 19 in the country.
The tournament will be a test for USC in order to see where they stack up against some of the top players in the country. Though it’s certainly an opportunity to gain success, the individual tournament comes second to the team’s goals for the season, which in this case is an NCAA championship.
“The whole weekend is going to be really good competition,” Katz said. “It’s going to help all of us going into NCAAs which is exactly what we need.”
The team is still raking in the excitement from its win over rival UCLA.  The win ended an undefeated Pac-12 season and a regular season in which the Women of Troy were only beaten twice.
Freshman Madison Westby was named Pac-12 Player of the Week for her deciding role in the match against UCLA. This is the second time Westby has received the honor this season.
No. 78 Westby capped an unbelievable come-from-behind win for USC over No. 28 Kyle McPhillips of UCLA with a final score of 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-4. The win was also the sixth consecutive for Westby who has an impressive 22-7 record overall this season.

Last week, I sat with folded hands before my father and sister, surrounded by the warm aroma of an udon shop. My father’s noodles lie in a dish before him, smooth and garnished with Japanese plum.
He looked at me and said, “You’ve changed.”
A comment like that was to be expected after half a year of studying abroad in Japan. Though the singularity of the country and the homogeneity of its citizens can be overemphasized, it’s true that the societal norms here were enough to change me. Now, I bow reflexively and hold the elevator door open for my elders. I am shy calling someone by their first name and uncomfortable using an over-familiar form of speech. I try to soften my loud, deep voice and straightforward words.
The Japanese culture is one of respect and restraint. To that end, there are two basic forms of grammar patterns — polite and casual — both of which can be divided into yet more variations, each connoting a different level of respect and intimacy. It’s unheard of to use a casual form of speech to one’s superiors at work. Juniors at school are expected to speak politely to their seniors.
Just two days ago, I was taking a night stroll around the temple district of Asakusa as part of a club event. The night was warm and quiet. The still water of the fountains and the petals of the cherry blossoms were lit up by street lamps. I was walking alongside a freshman who, assuming I was the same age, spoke casually with me.
Half an hour later, an acquaintance smiled and said, “Jasmine’s a third-year, you know.”
In a heartbeat, the freshman changed his speech style and apologized. He insisted on attaching “sempai” to my name, an honorific reserved for one’s seniors at school and in the workplace. Despite my protests that I care little for such things, I was moved that he treated me as he would treat another Japanese person.
That isn’t to say, though, that I’m used to the custom. Using different forms of speech is a constant reminder of the distance between me and whomever I’m speaking with. Sometimes, I feel like I’m on an escalator watching people pass me by, headed to some remote platform either below or above me. Many of my friends here tell me, “You’re basically Japanese now,” but I am far from completely assimilated, and the path I took to get to where I am now was not a smooth one.
Over winter vacation, I went on a ski trip with an international exchange circle. As night came and the snow glowed blue, the members sat themselves on the inn’s fragrant straw matting and made preparations for a party. After the opening toast, everyone was busy pouring drinks for everyone else.
I and another study-abroad friend sat alone at a corner table. Unsure of how to act and afraid of being intrusive, neither of us moved. I took a gulp of beer and coughed. The bitterness brushed at my lips and slid heavily down my throat.
A while later, a third-year noticed us and came over. Slapping me on the back, she asked, “You o.k.?”
I nodded, but she continued, “No, you must be under a lot of stress. You’re in a new environment, surrounded by people you don’t know. You’re trying to fit in and get depressed when you don’t. But don’t ever blame yourself if you feel lonely. It isn’t your fault at all. You shouldn’t have to be the only one trying.”
Thanks to the combined influence of alcohol and the unexpected timing and accuracy of her insight, I burst out into tears. I think any long-term study abroad student will agree, but in the shadow of all the fun experiences lurk stressful ones. For me, trying to embrace the Japanese culture has at times made me feel not only lonely among the people here, but among my own family as well.
Taking my father and sister around Tokyo, I realized I have come to live in a different world from them. I now speak a language they don’t understand and have internalized customs they find unfamiliar. They will most likely never come to fully realize what I felt the first time I was called “sempai,” or why I cried at that party. When my father said, “You’ve changed,” there was pride, but also sadness in his voice. Studying abroad has broadened my world view, but at the same time has pushed me into a sphere far away from the small, warm place where I was raised.
I think it’s safe to say studying abroad helps you grow up, whether you like it or not.

On Saturday, I went to the men’s volleyball game against California Baptist University. It was Senior Night for the Trojans, and I decided to go because I figured it would be the last time I’d get to see one of the greatest setters in the game play in cardinal and gold. The way the team and the fans celebrated Micah was one of the most palpable emotions I’ve ever experienced.
Senior Night made me think about some of the other incredible seniors who will be graduating in 2015. In addition to Micah Christenson, USC will say goodbye to Elizabeth Eddy, Monica Vavic and Garrett Stubbs. That’s not to say the entire class of 2015 won’t be sorely missed, but these four athletes are the ones that have stood out to me in my semester as a sports editor.
Christenson led the Trojans as a co-captain for three seasons. In addition to his success at the collegiate level, Christenson has made a name for himself as one of the best setters in the world. Last summer, Christenson was the starting setter for the U.S. Men’s National Team that won an FIVB World League gold medal. He was the only collegian on that team. In 2013, he also served for the national team at the NORCECA Continental Championships and was named as the tournament’s Best Server and Best Setter. Next summer, he will rejoin the men’s national team in Rio for the 2016 Summer Olympics.
Christenson will graduate with a degree in human biology. His leadership and skill will be big shoes to fill for the men’s volleyball team next season.
Eddy is one of the most talented Women of Troy to play for USC. She excelled in not only one, but two sports during her time at USC. Eddy’s natural athletic ability has brought her success in soccer as well as lacrosse. Her athleticism allowed room for versatility on the soccer pitch, as Eddy has played nearly every position for the Women of Troy, aside from keeper.
Though she was recruited for soccer, Eddy’s love for sports compelled her to take up lacrosse, and she joined the newly formed women’s lacrosse team. Though new to the sport, Eddy earned MPSF honors for her defensive performance.
She will leave USC with a degree in business administration. In January 2014, she was drafted by Sky Blue FC in the 2014 National Women’s Soccer League draft.
Vavic of the women’s water polo team has had an outstanding collegiate career, topped off by a senior season during which she became USC’s all-time leading scorer with 257 career goals. She is the daughter of Jovan Vavic, the head coach of the men’s and women’s water polo teams. Aside from her sheer talent, she is a team leader whom the Women of Troy will miss. Vavic will graduate with a degree in communication.
The baseball team is having one of the best seasons in recent years and is poised to go deep into the playoffs. This year, catcher Garrett Stubbs has emerged as a team leader.
Stubbs is batting .354 on the season, with the third highest average on the team. When he isn’t hitting, Stubbs is making heads-up plays behind the plate and leading his pitchers and the rest of the team.
Last season, the Baseball Draft Report ranked Stubbs as No. 40 on its 2014 MLB Draft College Catcher to Watch list. The baseball team still has a fair number of games to play this season, but behind the leadership of Stubbs, I am confident that the team will go far.
Though graduation is less than a month away, these seniors will be a part of the Trojan family forever. Once a Trojan, always a Trojan.

Why did you wait for the last home game of the regular season to attend? There were three other seniors with two of them
starters ( Feathers & Rivera ) for most of the season also playing their last game except for the tournament this Saturday. Baseball is a different entity with good juniors being selected in the MLB draft that will also depart the college scene. Great that Stubbs
stayed for four years along with Dante Flores, and A.J. Ramirez. It has been more than recent years for the team even  making the playoffs back in 2005.

True freshman Adoree’ Jackson has gone from small town hero to big city boy as he looks to prepare for not only the NFL Draft, but also the 2016 Olympics.  Jackson does it all with a goofy smile on his face and embracing the nickname “Sweet Pea,” which his mother gave him years ago.
The football standout started his athletic career for USC on the gridiron as a cornerback, wide receiver and kick returner. This in itself is enough to solidify Jackson as a player to watch through his athletic career at USC, but Jackson is not done there.  He also stars on the track and field team as a member of relay teams and as a long jumper.
Jackson’s athletic prowess as a jumper is nothing new.  In 2014, as a high school senior, Jackson jumped the second longest distance of all high schoolers in the country at 7.75 meters, a distance good enough for 22nd at the London Olympics.  Jackson’s goal for this season is to regain his track legs and work himself back to that level of competition.
As a two-sport athlete, Jackson knows his track days have an expiration date, but that does not stop him from reaching for stunning goals.  Jackson cites his ultimate track goal as jumping in the Olympics.
“Just take a shot at that dream,” said Jackson regarding his attitude toward his goal. “Being able to run track at the Olympics in Rio next year…”
Jackson knows that the road to the Olympics will be hard because he is not able to devote all of his time to training for that sport.
Jackson deals with the outside pressure by focusing on what he knows he can do and maintaining a steady work ethic to better himself.
“If you see me on the football field and then I don’t do so good, you say, ‘Why is he running track,’” said Jackson.  “You’ve got to make sure you are always on your game so people don’t say, ‘He shouldn’t be doing two sports.’”
The unrealistic expectations are generated as a result of Jackson’s dynamic performance so early in his career.
“Sometimes people think you aren’t human,” Jackson said.  “So when you make a mistake people just forget the fact that you are human and you make mistakes.”
Jackson gives high praise for the football team heading into the 2015 season, stating that the team is significantly further along this season than they were at this point last year.  One of the reasons for this improvement is another year under the direction of head coach Steve Sarkisian.
“We just want to take it        day-by-day,” Jackson said about the team’s attitude regarding the upcoming season.  “We saw what happened at Boston College,” referring to the team’s dismemberment by an unranked Eagles team despite the Trojans being ranked No. 9 nationally.  Jackson smiled about the game in hindsight, knowing it was a learning experience for both him and the team.
Jackson is working for a future in football, something that will be facilitated by his choice to play college ball for USC.
“USC is the best choice I’ve made so far,” Jackson said.  “Other than my decision to move to California.”
Jackson grew up in Belleville, Illinois, a small town where he participated in football and track growing up in addition to his favorite sport: basketball.
Jackson hopes to return home one day, perhaps even by pursuing his NFL dream of playing for the St. Louis Rams.
“I want to be the hometown hero,” said Jackson.  “I want people to say, ‘That’s the same guy we grew up with.’”
Jackson’s personality is reflected in the way he interacts with his fans. He often posts on Instagram and Twitter, thanking fans and reaching out to them.  This was evident most recently following the spring football game where Jackson could not stay to sign autographs for everyone, so he posted his Snapchat username to stay in touch with his fans.
“I just wanted to sign everybody’s autograph,” Jackson said.  “See what’s going on with them.”
Jackson exudes humility and friendliness that complement a smile that lights up the room.
“I just try to be the person that I came here as,” Jackson explains when asked why he works so hard to maintain such a high level of transparency and accessibility.
This refreshing and surprisingly mature sense of self bodes well for Sweet Pea as he carries on to St. Louis, Rio de Janeiro and beyond.
Jackson could be the next Jon Arnett – all world in football and in the long jump.

In early 2010, Sen. Marco Rubio was polling at 3 percent in the U.S. Senate race against then Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. By April 2010, Crist dropped out to run as an independent because Rubio was overwhelming his chances with the Republican Party. On Nov. 1, the Wall Street Journal published an article called, “Who’s Afraid of Marco Rubio?” The answer to that question was the Democrats. The Democrats were so scared, in fact, that Bill Clinton threw his support behind Crist.
On Nov. 2, Rubio won the election by a landslide, earning around the same amount of votes as both Crist and the Democrat candidate combined.
Rubio didn’t sweep this election because he changed his message or because he pulled some strings. He won the election because his story, charisma and ideals are irresistible. It is for these same reasons that he is at least one of the top five Republican candidates for 2016, if not the best.
Rubio is the son of Cuban refugees. His father was a bartender. Now 43 years old and a married father of four, the Florida Senator said in his announcement speech, “My father stood behind a small portable bar in the back of a room for all those years, so that tonight I could stand behind this podium in front of this room.”
He attended Santa Fe Community College before getting his undergraduate degree from the University of Florida and his law degree from the University of Miami. From there, he went from West Miami city commissioner, Florida state legislator, majority whip, majority leader and Speaker of the House to U.S. Senator.
Rubio’s humble story is the story of the American dream, impossible to disrespect. When people tout him as the “Republican President Barack Obama,” Rubio deflects with decisiveness, simultaneously acknowledging Obama’s high qualities of character and deploring Obama’s presidency. He is known for being one of the most genuine politicians in D.C. Competitor, old friend and former Florida governor Jeb Bush once said, “He’s the only guy I know on the scene today who makes grown men cry.”
His campaign slogan, “A New American Century, sums up his goals quite nicely: to transition America into the globalized economy and revitalize the American dream. Rubio campaigns on tough foreign policy, education reform that refocuses higher education on employment and tax cuts that strengthen the family and encourage economic growth.
There are those who believe Rubio is too young, and that perhaps he’d be better off waiting another term before running. Those people, however, are forgetting how our current president’s resume looked in 2008. Rubio’s people will quickly note that while Obama didn’t seem to accomplish anything as an Illinois senator, Rubio was the shining star of the Florida legislature and, unlike Obama, will have served a full term in the U.S. Senate if elected.
He is not shying away from his youth, either. His entire campaign is that America cannot be led by leaders of the past and that this “election is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be.”
True, Rubio will have to fight Bush for Florida funding. He will also have to fight criticism of his failed initial attempt at immigration reform. But he is irrefutably a valid candidate. If history is any indication, Republican and Democrat candidates alike would be foolish to dismiss him.

This guy is not at all ready for prime time. To anyone over 40 he looks and sounds like a kid. No new ideas whatsoever and no real conviction. Maybe in 4 or 8 years but I doubt he will win a single primary.

correctly.
Also trying to figure out why voters would think that he can, too.

Sen. Marco Rubio is the latest in the Republican Party to declare intent to run for president in 2016, joining Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, among others. During his announcement on April 13, Rubio claimed he was the best option to lead the United States into “another American century.” Though Rubio promises to better American lives, his platforms suggest he will stagnate American prosperity.
Rubio has already begun to express his position on a number of issues to differentiate himself from other candidates. On Sunday, while on CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Rubio said that he didn’t believe being gay was a choice. Despite this assertion that deviates from the common right-wing mentality, Rubio qualified himself by saying he still believed the definition of marriage is strictly confined to a union between a man and a woman. Rubio then falsely explained that being against same-sex marriage does not mean that he is anti-gay. But by denying the right of millions of people to get married, Rubio is, in fact, turning his back on the LGBT community in the United States. Holding clashing views in this matter highlights Rubio’s incompetency to fight for human rights, which had been furthered so much by President Barack Obama’s administration. Rubio would only obliterate these achievements as president.
Rubio is also a proponent of using military force and scare tactics to fight American enemies such as Iran, Russia and North Korea. On “Face the Nation,” Rubio said that the United States should take any measures necessary to halt Iran’s emergence as a nuclear power, including going to war. Rubio further stated, “[Iran is] an oil-rich country. The only reason why they want enrichment, and reprocessing capability is they want to one day be able to be a nuclear threshold, or nuclear possessed.” As president, if Rubio were to make Iran, or any country for that matter, an antagonist of the United States, he would ruin any chance of civil discourse between the two nations. That’s why war would be inevitable — Rubio would instigate unnecessary conflict.
Finally, it’s impossible to talk about Marco Rubio without acknowledging his participation in the 2013 bipartisan immigration bill, which sailed through the Senate but died in the House. The bill introduced a 1,200-page approach on how to achieve citizenship status for illegal immigrants and was supported by policymakers of both parties,- Rubio being one of the drafters. But when the House of Representatives, dominated by Republicans, criticized Rubio for his participation, Rubio walked away from the bill altogether. Now, Rubio has a new plan: first, lock down our borders and then refine the immigration system. It’s obvious here that Rubio is acting on the basis of what appeases his own party and not by what he believes. By folding on his own stance, Rubio doesn’t represent the change our generation needs to move forward.
Marco Rubio might be charming. He might have the credentials and titles lined up and down the block. He might have the sensationalized backstory to touch the hearts of millions. But one thing’s for sure — Rubio’s confused, feeble stance on many issues proves that Hillary Clinton’s got nothing to fear.

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism officially announced Monday Debra L. Lee, chairman and CEO of BET Networks, as the commencement speaker for the School of Communication and Jorge Ramos, anchor for Univision and Fusion, as the commencement speaker for the School of Journalism.
The ceremonies will take place on May 15.
Previous commencement speakers for Annenberg include KPCC President and CEO Bill Davis, Grammy-award winning music producer T Bone Burnett and former First Lady of California Maria Shriver.
Lee, hailed for her successes throughout the span of her 25-year career with Black Entertainment Networks, is the highest-ranked African-American woman at Viacom Inc., and is also an inductee in the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame.
During her time as COO and CEO for BET, Lee increased the production budget by more than 25 percent and redesigned the company’s mission statement to include more familial support and vision setting for families, according to a statement from BET. She has also increased viewership and revenue after overseeing major initiatives and additions to the network, such as the creation of shows including Let’s Stay Together, The Game, Black Girls Rock!, The Mo’Nique Show and Sunday Best. In 2005, Lee also added CENTRIC, a 24-hour entertainment network to garner the attention of more viewers.
Lee, a graduate of Brown University, also earned a master’s degree in public policy from Harvard University and a law degree at Harvard Law School. Lee holds an honorary doctorate of humane letters and currently serves as a member of the Board of Trustees for Brown University.
In 1981, she began her legal career as a law clerk for Barrington Parker for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. She was later appointed to the position of vice president of BET’s legal affairs department and general counsel in 1986. A decade later, Lee became the president and COO of BET Holdings, Inc. Lee currently sits on the board of directors for several multmillion-dollar companies, such as Revlon and Marriott.
Ramos, a recipient of eight Emmy Awards, is known for his work reporting for Noticiero and has received the Maria Moors Cabot Award for excellence in Journalism. He received his master’s degree in international studies at the University of Miami.
A native to Mexico City, Ramos graduated from the Universidad Iberoamericana where he earned his bachelor of arts degree in communications. In 1983, Ramos began his career in journalism when he took his first job as a reporter for KMEX-TV, a subsidiary of Univision Los Angeles. Ramos also has experience working for Telemundo, Fox Sports and ESPN Deportes.
The School of Communication ceremony will be held in McCarthy Quad, and the School of Journalism ceremony will be held at the John C. Argue Plaza.
Why can’t Annenberg get Malcolm Gladwell to be its commencement speaker? I think he’s more appropriate.
