The Trojans earned a 71-65 victory against Arizona State in the first-round of the Pac-12 tournament Wednesday. The loss ended the No. 9 seed Sun Devils postseason and with USC to go on to face No. 1 seed Stanford in Thursday’s quarterfinal round. 
The last time the Trojans and Sun Devils faced each other, sophomore guard Endyia Rogers tied her career high of 30 points, leading ASU to play tight defense against Rogers Wednesday. But it was not enough — Rogers finished with 15 points and 11 assists. 
Graduate forward Jordan Sanders and freshman forward Jordyn Jenkins both put forth strong performances. Jenkins led all scorers with a career-high of 16 points and 6 rebounds. 
“Today, we were all on the same page with what we wanted to do and what we wanted to accomplish,” Sanders said.“This is honestly the best team I have ever played on; just to get this team win the first game of the tournament feels really good.” 
ASU began the game slow which helped USC find their rhythm incredibly quickly. The first quarter began with a 9-0 USC run. USC shot 70% from the field by the end of the half. 
In contrast, ASU committed a total of 10 turnovers by the half. The Sun Devils struggled to adjust to USC’s zone defense and the Trojans were up 39-22 at halftime. 
The fourth quarter was a back and forth scoring affair, but USC maintained their lead. ASU appeared to wake up during the last three minutes of the game, but it was too little too late for the Sun Devils.
Sophomore center Angel Jackson led along in cheering with her teammates and carried each other with much energy. 
“We just have such great energy; it comes from the bench,” Jenkins said. “When we know that the bench is supporting us, I feel like we can do anything.” 
USC head coach Mark Trakh underscored the role chemistry played in the Trojans’ first win of the tournament. 
“The chemistry was really good tonight,” Trakh said. “Chemistry is going to be an important factor moving forward … This game was a great step in that direction.” 
USC communicated well throughout the game, evident when Arizona State would struggle to keep up with the Trojans’ fast-paced shooting. USC’s post footwork was also solid as sophomore forward Alissa Pili started off the scoring for the third quarter. 
Coach Trakh had high praise for Rogers, who finished with 11 assists.
“She handled a lot of pressure [and] played at a really good tempo, made shots early, and I think she really found her teammates,” he said. “I liked her overall point guard play … I liked that she got her teammates involved and we need that.” 
USC will play No. 1 seed Stanford in the quarterfinal Thursday. Tip-off is at 2 p.m.

Last fall, the Daily Trojan conducted a staff report to understand the strengths and shortcomings of the staff’s makeup. With that report, we recognized how our fall staff’s makeup had a crucial impact on stories and how they were covered. 
For the Spring 2021 recruitment process, the fall staff report was used as a catalyst for more intentional recruitment for spring staffers. Understanding that the fall staff was missing Native American, Indigenous and Alaska Native voices as well as non-cisgendered voices, the Daily Trojan reached out to various student organizations like the Muslim Student Union, La CASA, Queer People of Color and the Black Student Assembly to encourage their members to apply to join the spring staff. 
This spring, the Daily Trojan aimed to decrease the gaps seen in the Fall 2020 Diversity Staff Report because representation is a vital component of accurate, mindful and respectful reporting. USC is a campus of many different stories, backgrounds and experiences; thus, the Daily Trojan looks to ensure that our staff is representative of our community. 
After gathering data for two months from an internal survey that included questions related to class standing, student status and gender identity, along with others, we noticed some positive changes in the staff’s makeup. For example, there was a 6% increase in Latinx staffers. However, there is still much room for improvement. The Daily Trojan continues to fall short in some areas, including a drop in Black staffers and a lack of Native and Indigenous reporters.  
Methodology
Similar to the fall, the report covers class standing, race/ethnicity, gender identity, sexuality, student status and record of disability.  Student status was then divided into different subpoints for those who identify as one or more of the following: international, low income, first-generation, spring admit, receiving need-based financial aid and transfer status. 
The Daily Trojan recorded 210 staff responses to the survey, and the sections that had a 100% response rate were: video, online, social, diversity and inclusion staff and the Spring 2021 masthead. 
Analysis
The data from class standings remained relatively consistent with the fall report. 
Regarding race and ethnicity, the overall staff representation of East and South Asian communities remained relatively the same. East Asian staffers comprised 22.17% of the staff, and South Asian staffers comprised 14.74%. Similarly, the number of Middle Eastern and North African staffers remained at 3.48% of the total staff. There was an increase in Latinx representation from 9% to amost 15.65%. However, there was also a drop in Black representation from 6% in the fall to 4.35% in the spring. 
This increase in Latinx staffers is not sufficient, and the drop in Black representation is detrimental, considering Los Angeles and the surrounding USC community are predominantly Black and Latinx. 
The editorial staff is 23.53% East Asian, 23.53% white and 23.53% Latinx. The editorial staff does not include anyone who is transgender or men who identify as gay and no longer has Black representation. The lack of Black staffers on the editorial staff is unacceptable, and the Daily Trojan must keep this in mind when reporting on and for the Black community at USC.
The Daily Trojan is still composed of predominantly cisgendered women; however, there was a decrease in the number of cisgendered men staffers from 27% to nearly 23%. 
This spring, representation of non-binary and gender non-conforming people increased, 1.06% and 1.53%, respectively. 
Another turnaround was the number of women on the sports staff. Last semester, the staff was 73% men whereas now it has decreased to 58.33%, with women comprising 30% of the staff. Increasing women’s perspective on the sports staff will continue to be a goal for the Daily Trojan moving forward. In contrast, the news and arts and entertainment staff are still predominantly women. 
The Daily Trojan is still a predominantly straight staff, although the percentage of straight staffers did decrease from 73% to 67.33%. There was an increase in individuals who identify as bisexual, queer and questioning, representing 13.86%, 1.98% and 4.46% of our staff, respectively. This increase is not sufficient, however, considering Generation Z has the highest numbers of LGBT+ identifying populations.
The question of student status revealed that 22.68% of staffers noted they receive need-based financial aid and 11.15% indicated they are low-income students. Thirteen percent of the staff is first-generation, 12.27% are transfer students and 7.81% are spring admit students. These numbers are similar to those in the fall with some minor differences. 
Finally, the majority of the Daily Trojan staff are predominantly non-disabled people, with only 10.88% of staffers reporting that they have or have a record of disability.
Moving Forward
Understanding our staff’s makeup will help our coverage be more conscientious when reporting on and for certain communities such as the LGBTQ+ community, Latinx community and so many others that are an integral part of USC. The report will also be a tool we use in the Fall 2021 recruitment process to close the gap of missing community voices even further. 
The lack of Black voices in the editorial staff is the most concerning issue brought to light by this report. The Daily Trojan must consider this for the rest of the semester and work to do better in the fall. Although there were some positive improvements in the number of Latinx reporters, women in sports and sexuality, these increases were small. However,  other percentages, such as the number of Native and Indigenous staffers, remained stagnant. 
Moving forward, we must do a better job of making the Daily Trojan more accessible to these communities as well as people with disabilities. Every voice, background and experience is crucial to accurate reporting.

Correction: A previous version of this article misstated that the editorial staff does not include anyone who identifies as gay, when, instead the editorial staff does not include men who identify as gay. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Election results for the Undergraduate Student Government 2021-22 academic year were verified at the Senate meeting Tuesday. 
“After going through the receipts, complaints … everything was cleared and good to go, so today, our director of campus activities, Gabriel Vanzuela, certified the elections,” said Student Programs Advisor Luis Canton. 
The Senate also discussed a mental health initiative proposed by Senator Ruben Romeo earlier this month. According to Romeo, To Be Honest Mental Health, a third party vendor that would provide services to students with mental health needs, can be implemented and used by recognized student organizations to help students. Romeo also discussed the creation of an accessibility fund to help finance a pilot program from the vendor. 
“If an RSO comes to us with interest, we will talk about how to get ten people committed to four sessions, how to get the funds for this kind of a mental health initiative and how to put less stress on the financial aspect of getting this third party vendor,” said Romeo. “We just want to put on alternative mental health resources since counseling, and mental health can’t be offered to USC students beyond California with their license.”
According to Romeo, USG’s legislative branch holds a budget of $1,000 to fund four to five sessions provided by TBH Mental Health for ten students. These sessions would connect students with particular experiences or identities to life mentors, life coaches or clinicians in a safe environment depending on the students’ needs. 
Romeo also provided updates on USG’s involvement in supporting the community of students affected by the Myanmar political coup. Since USG released a statement in mid-February, Romeo created a taskforce and began drafting a resolution in support of “tangible asks,” such as financial monthly-payment / tuition costs-forgiveness, shelter for students who cannot return home and a pass / no pass option beyond-24-units for Burmese citizens. 
“The problem is USC administration has not been as vocal about [the Myanmar situation] as USG has been, and tangible ‘asks’ are more important for the community right now,” Romeo said. “We’re going to name explicitly those ‘asks’ that the numerous students asked for, or previous students asked for, and those ‘asks’ overlap with accessibility, wellness, affordability and academic affairs.”
Senator Julian Lin presented his projects, which included updating an existing resolution on CalFresh, a food stamp program for community members of a low income bracket in California. The current resolution was passed in October 2019, and called for prepared food vendors and markets on all USC campuses to become authorized CalFresh vendors. 
Lin also spoke about his work on two other resolutions, one relating to making OT 100 “THRIVE: Foundations of Well-Being” a required course for all USC students and another on the approval of a Palestinian flag to hang at the Center for International and Public Affairs. 
According to Lin, these resolutions will be formally presented at next week’s meeting.

Dr. Julie Tilson, professor of clinical physical therapy at the USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy, received an award for leadership in education late February from the American Physical Therapy Association Academy of Education — one of the highest honors in the field.
Tilson earned the award with her scholarship and administrative contributions in a long journey of physical therapy education. Besides being the director and one of the innovators of the hybrid Doctor of Physical Therapy program, Tilson’s work is recognized nationally and helps patients with physical challenges such as paralysis or vestibular disorders. 
“I was very honored,” Tilson said. “There are not many national teaching awards … so, to be nominated, to be seen by my peers as being worthy of such an honor was very rewarding and humbling.” 
Associate Dean and Chair of USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy Dr. James Gordon initially nominated Tilson for the APTAE award. Tilson’s peers soon joined the process of gathering letters of recommendation and a 54-page packet of her work history.
“[The APTAE award] recognizes not just somebody who’s a good teacher, which [Tilson] is, but somebody who has really shown leadership and leadership at the national level as well,” Gordon said. “She’s an extraordinary teacher who’s demonstrated that she can be an exemplary teacher, and she’s a model for everybody else in our program.” 
APTAE, which is one of the oldest physical therapy associations in the United States, aims to uplift physical therapy practice, education and evidence-based research to mend the health and quality of life of people in society, according to its website. Award eligibility is highly competitive and requires the recipient to prove outstanding leadership skills with many reference letters and documented long-term activity in the field of physical therapy.
Tilson’s work includes 32 peer-reviewed publications since 2007, along with 11 non peer-reviewed publications. She also co-wrote the definitive textbook, “Evidence Based Physical Therapy,” alongside retired USC adjunct professor Linda Fetters.
Tilson, who was academically successful from a very young age, said she knew she wanted to follow a path in healthcare from early on. At the age of 12, Tilson read a book about a child with cerebral palsy who was told she would never walk. In the novel, a physical therapist helped the child walk again, which inspired Tilson’s career, she said. 
Today, Tilson’s scholarship and teaching focuses on evidence-based practices where she helps clinicians use research and clinical trials to improve patient care. One example that Tilson gave was from her study about how physical therapists should provide care to people with certain types of inner ear disorders. 
“I became very passionate early in my career that this was something that really mattered, that made a difference in patients’ lives,” Tilson said. “It makes a difference in how providers feel about the care that they’re providing. It feels great when you know there’s good solid evidence behind what you’re doing.”
At the DPT program, Tilson’s work focuses on administrative leadership. The USC Division of Biokinesiology and Physical Therapy began structuring a hybrid physical therapy program in 2017, and Tilson played a massive role in its creation, Gordon said.
Tilson put together and organized asynchronous and synchronous activities for the three-year-program. Students learn from recorded videos of different therapy techniques, from live Zoom sessions to in-person immersions, where students practice their skills in 8-9 day labs, Gordon said. 
“You want to keep your focus on trying to make things better for the people you’re leading,” Tilson said. “It’s not about your ego. It’s not about that some people aren’t going to like things, because there’s always going to be people that don’t like things, but it’s about doing your darndest to make things better for the group as a whole.”
Gordon said that while the biggest challenge was to translate a hands-on discipline such as physical therapy to a hybrid program in 2017, Tilson created it from scratch, defied all odds and saw it through. The DPT program will graduate its first class this fall. 
Melodie Daniels is one of the students who plans to graduate with a doctorate in physical therapy this year and serves as the DPT program’s first president. Daniels described Dr. Tilson as wise, quirky and unique with a fun personality. She said that instead of giving general advice, Tilson looks at the student’s track record and provides specific recommendations for their academic growth.
“Tilson is an incredible educator,” Daniels said. “She’s really good about looking at a specific student, or just anyone who’s on some type of educational journey, and figuring out what they need to be better.” 
Tilson has not only made a difference in the lives of her students, but in the lives of previous patients as well, as evidenced by her office décor.
On the back wall in Tilson’s office hangs a framed Hawaiian yarn lei. Nearly 17 years ago, one of Dr. Tilson’s patients suffered from paralysis of her arm and hand following a stroke. After many physical therapy setbacks and successes, the 80-year-old woman finally achieved her goal of knitting a Hawaiian yarn lei, which she gifted to Tilson. 
In the future Dr. Tilson plans to continue to find mechanisms and avenues to improve physical therapy and education, and said she could have never done it without the help and support of her family and colleagues. She said her goal is for students to graduate DPT with confidence in their capabilities to provide care to patients.
“I want [students] to see that I’ve been accountable to what their needs are as learners, and that I have created an environment to optimize their success,” Dr. Tilson said. “I am trying to create a faculty, staff and institutional culture that meets every student where they are and does everything they can to help them be not just a physical therapist, but the best darn physical therapist they can possibly be.”

As a thoroughbred Canadian moving to California to study at USC, my idea of what Los Angeles would be like was almost exclusively cultivated by the mainstream media. In my first week in the City of Angels, I hit In-N-Out, Santa Monica Pier, the Hollywood sign and took a drive down Pacific Coast Highway through Malibu — classic staples, right? 
As I familiarized myself with the city and evolved from tourist to resident, I quickly realized that the landmarks I’d been raving over were basic tourist traps, dismissed by most L.A. natives as grossly misrepresentative of the city’s soul and spirit. I grew to share this conviction, learning that the stereotype of fame, fortune and glamor was but a minute fragment of a sprawling metropolis that had far more to offer than traditional depictions of the city allowed for. 
A melting pot, a kaleidoscope of cultures, a region rife with incongruous power structures that take the form of a chaotic and colorful landscape — that is L.A. Hollywood? Not so much.
This semester, as a senior at USC, I’m taking a comparative literature course called “Myths, Heroes, & Legends of the Modern City.” In it, we tackle the question of what are the prevailing mythologies of L.A. and how do they interact with its lived realities? The arguments made by my classmates and professor alike are telling of the city’s sociopolitical climate and worth sharing here: namely, that the overwhelming pressure of the Hollywood industrial complex and the entertainment industry relegates authentic Angeleno culture to the margins of invisibility.
Indeed, many people — especially those who are not from L.A. — conceive of the city as blockbuster films such as “La La Land” and “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” frame it: limited to West Hollywood and the Hills and the celebrities and uber-wealthy that inhabit them. The documentary “Los Angeles Plays Itself,” through a holistic overview of representations of L.A. in film and on television, points to the restrictive idea of the city that is perpetuated and recycled by Hollywood, which is an unsuited match for the L.A. that lives and breathes as I write this column.
Certainly, it’s far easier for the industry to zero in on the decidedly fake utopia that is Hollywood than to engage with its idiosyncratic, diverse and, at times, ugly truths. But that does a disservice, not only to the parts of L.A. that have been forgotten by the glitz and glamor, but also to anyone hoping to engage with representations of L.A. that are authentic, raw and real.
What is L.A., if not its sprawling Latinx, African American and immigrant communities, the dark and speckled colonial history that led to the class disparity we see around us today and the obliviousness of those who enabled it? What is L.A., if not the processes of gentrification that shifted entire South Central communities from their homes to build USC’s sparkling campus or that brushed Chavez Ravine residents aside to build Dodger Stadium in the ’50s? What is L.A., if not the homeless capital of the country and the city where Skid Row sits adjacent to glossy downtown skyscrapers?
Because L.A. is such a sprawling metropolis, it is such that tourist incentives and media representations are particularly mismatched with the city’s true identity. In fact, I wanted to test this theory and did a quick google search of “best things to do in Los Angeles.” What I got were lists with the likes of The Grove, Sunset Boulevard, Rodeo Drive, the Hollywood Bowl and Universal Studios — none of which, I’m sure we all agree, even crack the top-100 list of things to do in this city. 
What was left off these lists? Authentic Mexican street food, the open-air market at Santee Alley and dense cultural hubs like Koreatown (which probably won’t be around much longer thanks to — you guessed it — gentrification, so get on it, folks), to name just a few of the landmarks that breathe life into this city and that are too often dismissed or villainized by the mainstream media. Ironic, isn’t it, that the very things that make L.A. the vibrant landscape it is are consistently subject to exploitation and erasure?
It’s almost like colonization has a lasting impact that cuts across all areas of life, media representation included … oh, wait. 
In my class, we read this amazing book by Luis Rodriguez entitled “The Republic of East L.A.” made up of twelve short stories, written in the true lingo of the streets, that paint a profoundly nuanced and honest portrait of East L.A. and its inhabitants. When I was doing research for this column, I looked up reviews of the book and was surprised at the extent of criticism I found. Critics called Rodriguez’ stories “misfires orbiting a worthwhile themes,” arguing that they are “unfinished,” “incomplete” and “forced.”
Funny enough (and I’m thankful to the course for giving me this perspective), I think these criticisms are largely rooted in a Western gaze that engenders harmful misunderstandings of the lived experiences of the communities Rodriguez writes about. Oh, you’re mad there was no happy ending in the story about the undocumented family who was deported or the mill employee working paycheck-to-paycheck, trapped by the clutches of capitalism and a slave to labor by necessity? Wake up and smell the coffee, Karen.
Rodriguez’ stories are at once jarring and beautiful, rife with poverty and injustice but also laughter and the hope for a better life. It is a shame that we are seldom encouraged to engage with these sources, a shame that we are force-fed a one-dimensional conception of L.A. that has corrosive implications for the marginalized communities it casts aside. 
My comparative literature class brought to my attention the skewed perspective I packed in my suitcase with me on my journey from Montreal to L.A. I’m thankful for this push, but I can confidently say that many privileged white people coming to L.A. either won’t get that opportunity, or won’t take it even if they do. At a moment when media representation is a hot-button topic, it is useful to consider how a colonial mindset plays into mainstream portrayals of the City of Angels.
Before I sign off, here are some recommendations of texts, shows and movies that I think everyone should experience (thanks, Prof. Ortiz): watch Sean Baker’s “Tangerine,” Issa Rae’s “Insecure,” the documentary “Chavez Ravine: A Los Angeles Story” and read Rodriguez’ “The Republic of East L.A.” and Italo Calvino’s “Invisible Cities.” 
As processes of gentrification pick up their pace and systems of exploitation tighten their hold, we must fight back and immortalize sources that tell of an L.A. that can actually hold a candle to its colorful, chaotic identity.

Battling a field filled by predominantly white actors, USC alumnus Edwin Porres Jr. hopes to draw attention to stereotypes and the lack of diversity in Hollywood with his microbudget comedy film, “Hóllyweird.”
The film focuses on a man named Steve, a Latinx actor who struggles with the competition of Hollywood. When newcomer Alejandro “steals” the part of Steve’s dreams by pretending to be of Latinx heritage like Steve, Steve learns to embrace his Latinidad by confronting Latinx stereotypes and the lack of diversity in Hollywood.
“For me, this film was an opportunity to inform people of this problem and do it in a fun and entertaining way,” Porres said. “I relate to [Steve] because I started out as an actor, and I also face the whole concept of ‘being Latino enough.’ So that’s why I wanted to bring it out, to have the conversation in people’s minds.” 
Research by the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative revealed that 61.9% of Latinx characters portrayed in film are involved in illegal activities, such as organized crime and drug-related activities. Growing up and seeing the way Latinx peoples are underrepresented and grossly stereotyped in film and TV, Porres said he hopes to change the narrative through his work. Porres also referenced how the percentage of parts played by Latinx in film is significantly less than the portion of the population they compose. 
“If we’re portrayed like cardboard characters, if we’re dehumanized on screen,” Porres said. “This can lead to things like racism or discrimination, and even aggression towards minorities.” 
Porres began tinkering with a script back in 2015, amid the #OscarsSoWhite movement, which called attention to the lack of diversity in the Academy Awards. The movement has since expanded as a call for greater inclusion of marginalized groups in all aspects of the film industry. By summer 2016, Porres had finished the script and begun the pre-production process, cast auditions and picked filming locations with his wife, Jaime Porres.
The movie was a long process to produce, Porres said, particularly while working on a microbudget and balancing other careers. Porres was also an overnight counselor and medical historian, while his wife was balancing a fourth grade teaching job.
“At our level, I think at any level, it’s so difficult with limited resources to complete a movie,” Porres said. “The movie is going to take up your time, take up your money, take up your life. So,  choose a movie that you really believe in. For me, I believe in having Latino inclusivity and bringing up the issue of lack of Latino diversity … And for me, what kept me going was the comedy.” 
Jaime, who helped with the writing, production and post-production of “Hóllyweird,” said the message of the film was central to her own life growing up.
“I grew up here in [Los Angeles] and I grew up with a lot of diverse friends and I always thought it was strange that movies and TV didn’t reflect that,” Jaime said. “Everybody was white in the shows I would watch and the movies and so I kind of wanted to help address that.” 
The process was long for Jaime and Edwin, particularly because they were both raising their children and working other jobs. In addition, Edwin said it was a side project for many people helping on the film, so it took several years to complete. 
Eduardo Barraza, USC alumnus and cinematographer of “Hóllyweird,” worked closely with Porres as the cinematographer, especially during the production process. Barraza also said he has experienced firsthand the film industry’s lack of roles for people of Latin American descent during his time as a cinematographer.
Barraza was intrigued by the subject matter, particular how it touches on the stereotyping and lack of opportunities for minorities in Hollywood. “I was sort of interested in the idea of how people get pigeonholed into certain roles and certain stereotypes,” Barraza said.  
As the cinematographer, Barraza brought the script that Edwin and Jaime created to life. His role involved using visual concepts and themes that emphasize the story itself and help the audience connect with the characters and message. 
“I think if people liked the film, things are accomplished,” Barraza said. “If people can connect in any way to the story and to the characters, then that in itself makes the film successful.” 
The movie, finished right before the pandemic, has been released on a multitude of streaming platforms, including iTunes, Amazon, Google Play, VUDU and Roku. Now, Porres has been busy with social media promotion and the closed captioning necessary for it to be released to the Latin American market just last month.
Porres and his wife have also created their own production company which they started in 2016, One Life Pictures. The goal is to continue producing new films like “Hóllyweird” to draw attention to the lack of diversity and create new roles for Latinx people in the film industry, Porres said.
“I want to keep making Latino-centered movies and sharing different perspectives of the Latino culture,” Porres said. “We’re working on a script right now to be shot in Guatemala … This is really what I want to do, and I hope we get on even more platforms.”
Porres said he also hopes to increase viewership of “‘Hóllyweird” to continue drawing awareness and educating the public about the lack of diversity in the film industry. 
“For me, I want to bring light about the lack of Latino inclusivity and [allow the audience to] walk away from the movie entertained and be conscious of [the issue],” Porres said.

Let’s adventure to one of the most daring facets of pop culture, which this column has yet to traverse. It’s the realm of an era-defining legend, LGBTQ+ icon and groundbreaking musician whose works rival those of Beethoven, the Beatles and Michael Jackson.
That’s right: I’m talking about Britney Spears.   
Rising to stardom at the age of 16 with the release of “…Baby One More Time,” Spears consequently became one of the best-selling music artists of all time. However, with fame comes scrutiny by the media.
In 2007, she experienced a highly publicized and vilified mental health breakdown following sexist paparazzi criticisms of her “sloppy” partying behavior, multiple check-ins to psychiatric institutions and a resultant conservatorship put in place by her father in 2008.  
As the subject of tabloids and editorials for the years to come, Spears’ breakdown stunned the country; how could the dainty Princess of Pop suffer such an immensely drastic fallout after reaching the pinnacle of her career? 
Especially among child stars, society exploits mental health abnormalities by chewing them up and spitting them out for desperate consumption. Through a feminist analysis, we can examine the double-standards upheld by a toxic intersectionality of ableism and sexism. This intersection ultimately highlights how we still approach mental illness; we consistently want to destigmatize it, but once the illness becomes debilitating and beyond the scope of normal, we treat it as taboo instead of humanizing it. 
Hulu’s documentary “Framing Britney Spears,” a behind-the-scenes rundown of Spears’ mental health breakdown and the conservatorship that sparked the “Free Britney movement” on social media, explores Spears’ motives to remove her father from the conservatorship, saying that she is “afraid of him” and would “not perform as long as her father is in charge of her career.” 
A conservatorship is a court ordainment that places an individual or organization in charge of someone else’s assets. This is usually due to an individual’s inability to properly maintain their finances because of a disability, such as dementia or mental illness. Because of this abusive conservatorship, Spears has not been able to make her own decisions about her career, estate or other finances without the jurisdiction of her father since 2008. 
Not uncommon by any means, Spears’ legal case speaks to how difficult it is to release oneself from a conservatorship once implemented. These legal cases are particularly complicated because of the strenuous process for the conservatee to prove that they are able to manage their own life again. Since Spears’ efforts to terminate the conservatorship, her father’s lawyer has made public statements about how fans of Spears “have it so wrong” and how he “saved Britney’s life.” 
From here, we can expand the conversation to the rights of the disabled community and their humanity. Spears has proven through the past decade that she is competent enough to control her own career and life. Why is the legal system and society failing her by defining her life through a human and valid response to the endless misogyny and exploitation she endures? 
Her humanity can be seen in the careers of other childhood stars who Hollywood similarly built up to destroy — for example, Miley Cyrus and Lindsay Lohan and their “radical shifts” from childhood sweetheart to “off the rails” Disney disasters. In a recent op-ed published by the New York Times, Mara Wilson, star of “Matilda,” opened up about Hollywood’s mistreatment of girls and drew comparisons between the media’s sexualization and harassment of herself and Britney Spears. 
Sexualization of childhood stars such as Mara Wilson and Spears parallels harassment by the media. Once these stars become women, paparazzi nitpick and scrutinize every aspect of their life in a twisted double-standard. Justin Timberlake, Spears’ ex-boyfriend, recently apologized for confiding to media outlets that they had slept together and accusing her of cheating on him. Naturally, these comments had not affected Timberlake but only magnified the media’s obsession with Spears. 
The behavior of the media and their obsession with stars going ‘off the rails’ demonstrates how these stigmas plague our society. They manifest in the form of microaggressions particularly targeting women; for instance, the “crazy woman trope,” where women are repeatedly stereotyped as insane in film. This pervades into a culture where we have normalized saying “I’m insane” or “I’m toxic and manipulative” as quirky and glorified attributes. Despite the offense in these comments, we still affirm each other that mental health should be an open dialect. 
But as soon as mental illness becomes “uncomfortable” by society’s standards, we back away from our vows to combat the stigma. As soon as major depression is no longer just “being sad” but a debilitation so severe that one cannot even hold a job, we throw our compassion out the window and isolate the person with the disability. As soon as “bipolar” is more than just mood swings and a convenient label to attach to oneself when they are experiencing the usual highs and lows of life, we take a step back, initiate 5150 and allow a corrupt justice system to handle and objectify those who are most vulnerable to its injustice. 
The Free Britney movement should ultimately serve as a wake-up call to the systemic ableism that affects the millions of Americans impacted by a debilitating mental illness annually. It is not supposed to be a glamorous topic for people’s enjoyment and appropriation. After all, freeing Britney will not free everyone else afflicted with mental illness in abusive conservatorships.

USC football’s schedule for the 2021 season was announced Tuesday, featuring a 12-game campaign that has the Trojans set to play nine conference games and three non-conference games. The Trojans are coming off one of their more promising seasons in recent memory, just one win away from being Pac-12 champions and having an outside shot at a College Football Playoff spot. Looking forward, here are some of the most important matchups USC will face in its quest for its first conference championship since the 2017-2018 season.
Oct. 2, Week 5 at Colorado 
USC and Colorado didn’t end up facing each other during the 2020 season because of coronavirus complications, but the matchup was set to be very influential in determining the Pac-12 South champion. The Buffaloes definitely have the offensive firepower to put up a fight against any opponent next season. Their running game was strong in 2020, with sophomore running back Jarek Broussard rushing for about 162 yards per game. The Trojans only had one game last season where they allowed under 100 rushing yards, so they’ll need to make improvements in the run game before this matchup.
Since Colorado is a Pac-12 South team, a win over the Buffaloes would be an extra boost toward USC’s conference championship game aspirations. 
Oct. 23, Week 7 at Notre Dame 
This rivalry game didn’t take place last season because of the Pac-12’s abbreviated, conference-only schedule. Since 2000, USC has enjoyed an edge in this matchup, but Notre Dame has won the last three times the teams have met. The Fighting Irish are fresh off of yet another College Football Playoff appearance, although it was an unremarkable blowout at the hands of eventual champion Alabama. The Irish will also be without stars on both sides of the ball thanks to the NFL Draft, such as quarterback Ian Book and linebacker Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, a unanimous All-American.
A trip to South Bend will certainly be a challenge, as Notre Dame posted a perfect home record last season with a marquee win in overtime against then No. 1 Clemson.  
Nov. 6, Week 9 at Arizona State
The last iteration of this matchup was a nail-biter, as USC completed a fourth-quarter comeback in the first week of the 2020 season to win 28-27 over the Sun Devils. The Trojans scored two touchdowns inside the game’s last three minutes and sophomore quarterback Kedon Slovis completed 40 passes for a total of 381 yards. ASU’s sophomore quarterback Jayden Daniels will be a returning threat both as a passer and a scrambler. 
Herm Edwards’ team will look to improve on last season’s 2-2 record (three of ASU’s games were cancelled due to coronavirus complications). Edwards and company did close out the season with two wins, one of which was a 70-7 thrashing of Arizona. The Sun Devils and the Trojans matched up well last time out, so expect 2021’s iteration to feature some fireworks as well.
Nov. 20, Week 11 vs UCLA
The importance of this game needs no explanation, especially after last season’s 43-38 Trojan win, capped off by a USC game-winning drive with less than a minute left. 
UCLA is coming off of a disappointing 3-4 season with losses to Colorado, Oregon and Stanford. Returning quarterback junior Dorian Thompson-Robinson will be the focal point of the offense, and his main weapon will be redshirt sophomore Greg Dulcich, who was second in the country for tight ends last season with 73.9 receiving yards per game. He had 167 yards and a touchdown in the game against USC. 
Not only are bragging rights on the line, but a trip to the Pac-12 Championship game is likely to hang in the balance. If UCLA outperforms its record from last season, the Bruins might be playing for their first appearance in the Pac-12 championship game since 2012. Even if it’s another disappointing season for the Bruins, they’ll have every reason to ruin their crosstown rival’s season. 
Nov. 27, Week 12 vs BYU
BYU will come to the Coliseum in an interesting matchup to end the season for the Trojans. The Cougars went 11-1 last year with their only loss being to Coastal Carolina. They will be without star quarterback Zach Wilson, who is a projected first-round pick in the upcoming NFL draft.
Wilson threw for nearly 3,700 yards and 33 touchdowns last year, and BYU might have a tough time replacing that kind of production. Nevertheless, the Cougars will be a formidable opponent for USC, as evidenced by their 30-27 win over the Trojans in 2019. This season’s matchup will serve as a final test for USC before bowl season.

The NBA will be hosting its annual All-Star Game in Atlanta this weekend. It was initially going to be held in Indianapolis, but since they are hosting the NCAA men’s basketball tournament, the NBA has changed its plans.
In last year’s game, the NBA changed the scoring format so teams would have to reach a certain score to win rather than the game ending based on time. Consequently, we witnessed one of the best All-Star games ever with an iconic finish between Team LeBron and Team Giannis in which the players actually tried to win, unlike most All-Star games which typically lack a lot of energy. In a normal season, we would expect players to want to return, but many of this year’s All-Stars are hesitant to join. 
LeBron James said he has “zero energy, zero excitement” for this season’s All-Star game. James said he already had to face a shortened offseason since the Lakers went to the Finals last season, and he wants a break. 
“They [the NBA] throw an All-Star Game on us like this and just breaks that all the way up,” James said. “So, um, pretty much kind of a slap in the face.”
Honestly, after I heard LeBron say that, I thought Adam Silver and the league would cancel the game since LeBron is the face of the league and the unofficial spokesperson for the players. But surprisingly, the game looks like it will go on. 
Obviously, we know the pandemic is what’s primarily causing players’ reluctance to go to the All-Star game and players likely want some time to relax. As James mentioned, this is a shorter season, and just as USC students needed a break from our own condensed semester, players need a break from their condensed season to maintain their health, both mentally and physically. 
Another issue with holding the All-Star game this year is that it can potentially contribute to the spread of coronavirus. We have seen many games get postponed and athletes not being cleared to play due to positive COVID tests, so it is a bad decision for the NBA to bring all its star athletes into the same area for the weekend. 
To add further context to the dangers the game poses, after the All-Star game is over, players like James and Brooklyn’s big three — Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and James Harden — are going back to their original teams in the country’s most highly populated cities after just spending the weekend with other players from all over the country.
Moreover, the NBA’s precautions for the All-Star game don’t seem very strong, which is only increasing apprehension towards the game. For example, COVID-19 vaccinated individuals do not have to go through daily PCR testing. Many coaches and personnel are on the older end, so they most likely got their vaccines, but just because you are vaccinated doesn’t mean you cannot transmit the virus to others. Also, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines do not have 100% efficacy against the virus, so there are still risks by not testing everyone. 
Finally, players that are not taking part in the All-Star game festivities are still allowed to travel across the country, although they cannot stay in public areas such as hotels. Even though players that travel will be tested once they return to their team, the league and teams do not have full certainty that the players will adhere to strict protocols while traveling, and knowing the virus’s incubation period, players can potentially spread the virus further.
Holding the All-Star Game doesn’t seem like the best idea given the current circumstances. Even though cases are dropping and the national vaccine rollout continues, the coronavirus stilll poses a threat to countless Americans, and the All-Star game doesn’t really hold any value this year aside from functioning as a fun, but nonetheless meaningless, exhibition game.
