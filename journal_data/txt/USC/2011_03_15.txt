After a  magnitude 8.9 earthquake and tsunami struck Northern Japan, a UCLA  student posted a video on YouTube complaining about Japanese students who,  attempting to reach loved ones back home in Japan, were disturbing  her studies.
The  video has faced a myriad of criticism, prompting UCLA Chancellor  Gene Block  to release a video message openly criticizing Wallace’s  YouTube post.
The original video, titled “Asians in the Library,” was posted by Alexandra Wallace, a junior majoring in political science at UCLA.
Wallace said Asian students talking on their phones lack manners and she blamed them for distracting her from her work.
“In  America we do not talk on our cell phones in the library…when  I’m about to, like, reach an epiphany, over here from somewhere, ‘Oh, ching chong ling long ting tong? Oh,’ ” Wallace said in the video.
Block said in his video response that Wallace’s YouTube post has “caused a lot of pain.”
“This  has been a sad day for UCLA and a disappointing day for me personally,”  Block said. “The UCLA described in the video is not the University that  I know.”
Since releasing the YouTube video, Wallace has apologized.
“Clearly  the original video posted by me was inappropriate,” Wallace said. “I  cannot explain what possessed me to approach the subject as I did, and  if I could undo it, I would.”
The death toll for the tsunami and earthquake in Japan, which occurred on March 11 , is currently 6,000, but continues to rise.

Another reporting fail from DT – business as usual.
The author COMPLETELY missed the point of the video – it was not at all targeted at Japanese students. It was targeted as “Asians” (doesn’t matter what race to Alexandra Wallace, because they are all the “same”) – and in that huge umbrella, she managed to insult all Asian races. The fact that she mentioned the tsunami was merely a part of this ignorance. Anyone who knows Japanese culture would know that talking in quiet areas such as the train and library on their cell phone is basically a sin.
Did the author even watch this video?

That is all.
I got rejected from UCLA and she’s there?? (I’m not a USC student)
Ok, this was STEREOTYPICAL, but not RACIST. I disagree with what she said, but the asian fraternities at my undergrad had MUCH worse stuff to say about white people. 
The tsunami reference? not ok. All the rest is in poor taste, but she shouldn’t get in trouble for speaking her mind. I’m pretty sure it was her chest making the comments tho, not her mind.
I am disappointed that this article only focused on the comments she made about students who were trying to contact their relatives in the Tsunami. That is only part of this student’s comments. This rant is racist and a clear example of how much more work we need to do to educate ourselves about the people in our community. And, USC, this is not a UCLA incident. I’ve heard comments like this and worse on our own campus community!
On all points, agreed!

On the surface a play-in game in the city of Dayton, Ohio doesn’t look like college basketball paradise. For the USC men’s basketball team, however, after a year of ups and downs, it might as well be.
Wednesday night, the Trojans take on Virginia Commonwealth of the Colonial Athletic Association in the inaugural “First Four” Round of the NCAA tournament. Although you can’t find the play-in game on your March Madness bracket, it’s a step USC (19-14, 10-8) is not taking lightly, considering a month ago there was no mention they’d even be playing basketball in the third week of March.
“We have a tremendous amount of respect for every team we play and VCU being in the tournament as an at-large deserves our respect,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “They’re going to play up and down, they’re going to shoot threes, they’re going to play incredibly aggressive, they’re deep, they play hard. We know we are going to have to play a great game to win against anybody.”
VCU (23-11, 12-6) is making its third NCAA tournament appearance in the last five years. The Rams inclusion in this field of 68 teams marked a record for the CAA, which received three tournament bids for the first time in the history of the conference.
While the Rams at large-bid was received with tremendous criticism by the national media, second-year coach Shaka Smart led his team to notable wins against other tournament-bound teams this season like UCLA, George Mason, Wofford and Old Dominion.
Led by the shooting prowess of junior guard Bradford Burgess (14 points per game, 48.8 field goal percentage and 40.1 three-point percentage) and the veteran leadership of senior forward Jamie Skeen (15.3 points, 7.5 rebounds and 1.2 block per game) and senior guard Brandon Rozzell (11.3 points per game, 1.4 steals per game and 38.6 three-point percentage), VCU comes in to the University of Dayton Arena confident it can play its way into the second round.
Although the Rams head into the tournament having lost five of their last eight games, the team admits their confidence hasn’t been dented by the recent backlash caused by their at-large bid.
“If you’ve watched us all year, we have guys who get motivated by the criticism,” VCU coach Shaka Smart told ESPN’s Rece Davis. “We’re excited. If people doubt us, we will use that as motivation.”
While all sights seem set on tonight’s play-in game against the Rams, the Trojans believe their season is not meant to end in Dayton.
“We are not just happy to be here,” senior guard Donte Smith told the media after Tuesday’s practice. “We feel like we can make some noise in this tournament.”
And speaking of noise, O’Neill will be back on the bench to coach the team against VCU, after serving a one-game suspension over the weekend for his involvement in an altercation on Thursday night.
Wednesday’s tip-off is slated for 6 p.m. and can be found on truTV with Gus Johnson on the call.
The winner will represent the Southeast Region as the No. 11 seed and will head to Chicago to take on the No. 6-seeded Georgetown Hoyas on Friday night.
SC fans/alums/students:  Please ignore computerpals.  I saw this link on espn.com and wanted to know more about your team.  We’ll (VCU) have our hands full w/ your center so we have no room for trash talk.  I was impressed with the article, seemed balanced to me.
Hahaha you seriously posted a comment on our school newspapers website? wow get  a life
Oh YEAH, just keep thinking VCU isn’t much to deal with, we will SEE! GO RAMS. (from Virginia-Not someone posing– e.g. a UCLA bruin etc.)

The full length trailer for Super 8 seems more concerned with character and story rather than predictable plot points filled with special effects. The film is directed by J.J. Abrams, but the trailer reminds us more of the films of Steven Spielberg.
Super 8 is produced by Steven Spielberg, who had a hand in the development of its story. The film isn’t interested in famous faces or conventional clichés, but rather a group of characters and their fascination with something out of this world. The Steven Spielberg touch is evident even in the trailer, which pays homage to now-classics like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial.
The story takes place in Ohio in 1979 and follows a group of children making their own film on a Super 8 camera. The children witness a catastrophe from which “something decidedly inhuman” emerges.
J.J. Abrams is the creative mind behind television shows and films such as Lost and Cloverfield. Super 8 is scheduled for release on June 10, 2011.

Northern California rock group Papa Roach is currently touring Canada but in late April they will be bringing their electrifying live show across the United States starting in Mesa, Ariz. and ending in Pryor, Okla. on May 29.
The tour is aptly titled the “Raid the Nation” tour and will feature support from Las Vegas rockers Escape the Fate, Canadian rock group Finger Eleven and Michigan-based group Pop Evil.
Among the stops on the tour are the House of Blues in Hollywood, Calif., the House of Blues in Anaheim, Calif., Las Vegas, Nev., Seattle, Wash., and Philadelphia, Penn. All in all, the tour will feature 23 shows.
Fans can expect Papa Roach to emphasize their newest material, playing a healthy amount of songs from their September 2010 release, Time for Annihilation, and their 2009 release Metamorphosis. Old school fans of the band who have been following them since their inception in 1993 have nothing to fear, though, because Papa Roach almost always closes its shows in a raucous fashion as it blazes through older hits like “Broken Home,” “Between Angels and Insects” and “Last Resort.”
After the tour, Papa Roach expects to begin the writing process for a new record, hoping to enter the studio around September of this year. Fans can expect the new album in 2012.
