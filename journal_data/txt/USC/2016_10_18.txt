Gender gap · Jennifer McCleary-Sills of the International Center for Research on Women explained the factors that lead to gendered violence.
Dr. Jennifer McCleary-Sills, director of the Global Program on Violence, Rights and Inclusion at the International Center for Research on Women spoke about the impact of violence against women and the need to work toward gender equality at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Tuesday. 
The talk, “The Costs of Exclusion: How Gender Inequality Stymies Global Development” was the first one of the 2016-2017 USC Global Health Lecture Series and was co-hosted by the USC Institute for Global Health and GlobeMed at USC.
During the United Nations Decade of Women from 1976-1985, the international agenda focused on women and spoke about the commitments that the UN member states would make to improving women’s status around the world. According to McCleary-Sills, this period saw an increasing recognition of women’s rights and an increased focus on gender inequalities, particularly on violence against women. Also, the ICRW was founded during this period, in 1976.
“Here, in the United States, it was one of the most thriving periods for the feminist movement,” McCleary-Sills said. “1979 was also a watershed year for global development since the member states of the United Nations committed to eliminating all sorts of discrimination against women including workplace discrimination, health disparities and violence.”
Since then, education has been one of the areas where a good amount of progress has been made. According to McCleary-Sills, girls have been disadvantaged in primary education over boys. However, when it comes to tertiary education, there is a very small gap between the enrolled girls and boys.
“The gap is reducing with time and is much better than what it was 30 years ago,” McCleary-Sills said.
McCleary-Sills currently works as a researcher of the deprivation of rights and gendered dimensions of violence at ICRW. Before joining the ICRW, she was a senior gender-based violence and development specialist at the World Bank Group, where she co-authored the flagship publication “Voice & Agency: Empowering Women and Girls for Shared Prosperity.” 
During the talk, she also presented samples of her recent work in the Violence Against Women and Girls Resource Guide. She has 15 years of experience as an international development professional and has researched in places like Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and the Pacific Islands.
McCleary-Sills also spoke about the progress made in the area of health. She said that in spite of prevalent issues like maternal mortality, pregnancy complications and violence against women, the life expectancy of women has improved since 1960. Her research showed the rate of fertility decline from an average of 5 births per woman to 2.5 births per woman.
“The fertility decline is a good thing because the number of children is linked to your health outcomes,” McCleary-Sills said. “As a woman, the number of children I bear is directly proportional to the risks that I bear.”
McCleary-Sills’ research showed the strain of population growth and its effect on a country’s economy and its ability to provide adequate resources for its citizens. She mentioned that income is one of the biggest inequalities that women face. Aspects such as formal employment that requires women to leave their families as opposed to doing work at home or in the community are still not globally accepted.
“Even though women’s labor force participation has increased, the gap in wages in enormous,” McCleary-Sills said. “Unfortunately, there is still a lot of segregation.”
McCleary-Sills’ study shows that globally, one in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a partner. This amounts to 700 million women across the globe.
“I hope you find that number as jarring as I do,” McCleary-Sills said.
When adding women who have experienced non-partner sexual violence, that number goes up to 818 million. McCleary-Sills’ study shows that 21 percent of women from North America face physical or sexual violence, whereas in South Asia, 43 percent of women face such violence, which is the highest globally. McCleary-Sills said the study also shows that poorer women have a higher risk of being prone to such violence, such as from lack of education or being married to men with low education.
In addition to physical and sexual violence, McCleary-Sills also studied other violence against women such as emotional violence, economic disadvantages, sex trafficking and child marriage. 
She discussed the problem of child marriage across the countries and her studies show that this violence against women is prevalent even today. In the United States, child marriage is legal in some states.
“[Child marriage] is very much a problem in the United States and [those of] us at ICRW are working with a few partners in order to eradicate this problem,” McCleary-Sills said.
McCleary-Sills discussed the health impacts a woman faces due to violence. According to her research, violence in a relationship has a 68 percent increased risk of an unintended pregnancy. Other health impacts include low birth weight, preterm birth, abortion and miscarriage.
Moreover, McCleary-Sills mentioned the discrimination that the LGBT community faces and that she does not treat discrimination as a lower form of violence. This discrimination can also impact a country’s growth. Her research of 2012 shows that India’s 0.1 percent to 0.7 percent of GDP can be lost due to discrimination against LGBT community.
“This is a small percentage, but India is a booming economy, and this percentage amounts [from] $712 million to $23 billion,” McCleary-Sills said.
In 2015, the member states of the United Nations adopted the sustainable development goals that need to be achieved by 2030. These goals work towards eradicating poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring prosperity for all. McCleary-Sills does most of her work towards achieving the gender equality goal.
“If we don’t fix the gender inequality between men and women, there is no way we are going to achieve the sustainable development goals,” McCleary-Sills said.

Martina Erdstein | Daily TrojanSmoke break · Sen. Daniel Newman, pictured here at a meeting in August, discussed his resolution to ban smoking on campus Tuesday.
At this week’s USG Senate meeting, several senators gave updates on the projects they are working on in order to help underserved USC populations and the student body at large.
Senator Tingyee Chang called for a more well-developed transfer student program to better integrate them into the USC climate. To do this, Chang has planned for a focus group, followed by a survey, a town hall meeting and a feasibility meeting to determine the possibility of implementing any of the solutions the group comes up with.
Chang also wants to create a survey to provide a more accessible way to find information about student housing, especially off-campus housing. In light of the hurdles that students have faced recently with unreliable off-campus housing management, Chang’s proposal seeks to create a housing database in order to keep management firms more accountable, while also enticing them with the promise of exposure among USC students. 
Creating a more welcoming environment for students with disabilities was Chang’s main focus in her third project. She feels that the academic support for students with disabilities is functioning well, but that there is more to be done in other areas.
“The burden should be on the majority of our able-bodied students to invite disabled students to participate in our student organizations,” Chang said. “The onus shouldn’t be on the disabled students to request all these accommodations when it’s something that all of us should be thinking about.”
Chang hopes that discussion with students with disabilities will produce ways for them to be supported in the campus culture. Campus organizations could create resource guides for student organizations, providing information on accessibility, or student caseworkers to help disabled students navigate not only academics, but also social aspects of student life to make students with disabilities feel more welcome. Ultimately, Chang would love to see a Disabled Students Union.
“There will always be things that the students themselves need to accomplish, but we should try as hard as we can to break down these barriers and show disabled students that we really care,” Chang said.
 Senator Tyler Matheson main project continues to be improving mental health resources on campus. 
The USCard resolution that was proposed at the last meeting was passed at this meeting, with an amendment that would keep “essential information” on the back of the card while replacing inessential information with emergency phone numbers. 
 Matheson also brought up partnering with the counseling center to determine ways to combat the underuse of its services. Although currently in the stage of collecting data, Matheson shared that in 2014, there were 33 hospitalizations for students who were in danger of doing harm to themselves or others. In contrast, 100 such hospitalizations have occurred so far this year. Matheson is also looking into a collaboration between The Haven and the Keck School of Medicine. The Haven is a counseling-style intensive recovery unit near campus, utilized by those coming out of hospitalization and by many younger people as a support network. 
“The problem is that it is difficult to get someone to go to therapy when it’s far away,” Matheson said. 
Matheson is looking into the rights of students under HIPAA, and whether the fact that a student has been hospitalized for mental health issues can be disclosed.
At this point in the school year, $62,000 of the available $350,000 have been allocated to student programs. This is less than 25 percent of the expected total, past midway through the semester. According to the funding branch director, this is most likely due to fewer applications for funding. This could possibly be because of insufficient advertising for funding, or the problems with the funding website as a result of having only one director of technology. 
Senator Sabrina Enriquez brought up the possibility of paying assistant directors again. Previously, assistant directors were given a stipend for their contributions to USG, but this was removed in a bylaw amendment. Although the idea would reward those who have contributed many hours to the organization, the stipend money would have to be taken from other areas of the budget.
Senator Daniel Newman brought up the resolution that he has been working on to make the USC campus smoke- and tobacco-free, saying that he had garnered over 90 percent faculty approval for it at a recent Academic Senate meeting. The official voting on the proposal will occur tomorrow.

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanDigital revolution · Rashad Robinson, executive director of the national social justice organization Color of Change, spoke at a seminar Tuesday.
Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, the nation’s largest online civil rights organization, conducted a seminar on the uses of social media and other digital information tools in the design of mobilization and influence strategies in Annenberg Auditorium on Tuesday evening. 
Color of Change was established by James Rucker and Van Jones in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, a period that Robinson said epitomized the black struggle.
“No one was nervous about disappointing black people at this time,” he said.
So, the organization built a new, effective strategy for changing the rules society lives by and ending the injustices black people face. The organization seeks to “strengthen the political voice of Black America, using the power of technology,” according to its website. 
Throughout his career, Robinson has helped mobilize communities across the country to undertake successful campaigns to foster more inclusive cultural and political institutions. At Tuesday’s event, Robinson spoke about the ways that Color of Change has used its online platform to address issues ranging from the shooting of Philando Castile to the suppression of the black vote. 
“We are applying organizing skills to the technology today to translate presence to power,” Robinson said. “To ensure we are not just sharing articles but mobilizing to conduct actual change.”
The organization does so by utilizing Facebook, Twitter, emails and peer-to-peer texting to mobilize campaigns and voting initiatives. Robinson detailed the fine line between social media as a tool and as an impediment. 
“Forty-five percent of Color of Change’s new members come through Facebook shares, but it’s important to note the various ways social media platforms can also work against us,” Robinson said. “Social media is often glorified, but we must realize it is also corporatized like other media platforms, which can be deeply problematic.” 
Tuesday’s event also addressed how Color of Change interacts with public figures, such as football player Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand for the national anthem at a game in order to show support for victims of police brutality. Brian Walker, culture and entertainment advocacy director at Color of Change, further introduced the work the organization does with celebrities to foster change. 
“We work with other entertainers, celebrities and artists that want to speak out about social issues by mobilizing their platform,” Walker said. “Ultimately, we build an overall discussion about the right athletes, and celebrities at large have to express their freedom of speech.”
Robinson said that ultimately, organizations like Color of Change can use social media to make individual actions part of a larger conversation about social justice in America.
“We do so in a way that does not just respond to issues, but transmits to some larger  change,” Robinson said.

The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission will receive $180,000 in payment after two concert promoters who had been accused of bribery entered separate plea deals, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
Pasquale Rotella and Reza Gerami had been implicated in a bribery case involving the Coliseum’s former assistant general manager, Todd DeStefano, in 2012. In August of this year, the charge was dropped after prosecutors acknowledged that they had mishandled evidence in the case, and Rotella instead pled no contest to a misdemeanor charge of conflict of interest, according to the Los Angeles Times.
DeStefano was sentenced to six months in jail in September for his role in a corruption scandal that implicated entertainment companies who organized raves at the publicly owned venue, and was ordered to pay $500,000 directly to the Coliseum.
Insomniac Events’ Rotella and Go Ventures’ Gerami agreed to pay $150,000 and $30,000 to the Los Angeles County Treasurer and Tax Collector, respectively. The Board of Supervisors unanimously voted that this money would be used to pay the Coliseum Commission for its losses in the bribery case.
The president of the Commission, Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, emphasized the need for Rotella and Gerami to pay.
“Fairness and equality mandate that all of the restitution paid by the criminal defendants in this case be returned to the Commission, which is the clear victim of the alleged crimes,” Ridley-Thomas said in a statement. “The shame brought to the Coliseum Commission by the rampant criminal acts of former employees and vendors cannot be overstated. The Coliseum Commission is determined to bring all unlawful actors to justice and make them pay every stolen dollar back to the public.”
Rotella and Gerami have also been placed on probation. According to the Los Angeles Times, the Los Angeles County prosecutors had contended that rave companies put public health and safety at risk, and exploiting millions of taxpayer dollars.
Correction: A previous version of this article contained errors. The story incorrectly stated that the The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ordered Rotella and Gerami to pay the Coliseum Commission $180,000 in restitution for their role in bribing the Coliseum’s former general manager. Rotella and Gerami agreed to pay $180,000 to the county as part of a plea deal on a separate charge of misdemeanor conflict of interest, and felony bribery charges against them were dropped in August. The Board of Supervisors then voted that these funds would go the Coliseum Commission. The Daily Trojan regrets the errors.

Photo from USC Thornton School of MusicFrom the top · Over the past 25 years, the New Music for Orchestra event has premiered more than 125 compositions, often leading to professional commissions and international recognition. The performance was conducted by Donald Corckett, chair of the Composition program.
The USC Thornton Symphony performed new compositions written by student composers in their  “New Music For Orchestra” concert Friday evening in Bovard Auditorium. The new compositions included “Relapse” by Peter S. Shin, “Chasm” by Ryan McWilliams, “Amargosa” by Bryan Kurt Kostors, “The Good-Old Days” by Georgi Dimitrov and “Unearth, Release” by Julia Adolphe. The concert provided insight into the musical possibilities of contemporary classical music, even if contemporary trends are an acquired taste.
The pieces for the evening were characterized by their experimental styling. What has come to be a contemporary trend in composition, deconstructivist and dissonant leanings, while not a crowd favorite, can be valued for its academic and critical merit.
Heavy dissonance and a lack of uniformity characterized Shin’s “Relapse.” A highly figurative theme and musical language made up McWilliams’ “Chasm.” Mellan’s “…on transcendance…”  seemed to lack  specific direction.
There seemed to be two forces working against the student composers: the first being their age and level of composition maturity, the second being general contemporary trends throughout the high-art world throughout various mediums, including classical music. However, credit is deserved where credit is due. The three pieces seemed to showcase maturity and progression in the compositional style. “Amargosa,” according to the concert notes, was written to reflect on the Amargosa desert region  — a California desert at the Nevada state line named for its amargosa or  “bitter water.” Kostors’ composition took on a defined, cerebral style. The piece acted as a strong soundscape that embodied the unique culture and geography of the California desert in a musically mature way. 
Dimitrov’s “The Good-Old Days” also deserves a mention for its musical clarity. The melody and musical progression was commendable, albeit slightly simplistic. Dimitrov’s slight cues to historical styling also added an interesting element of post-modernist musical language. 
Fronted by viola soloist Cynthia Phelps, in “Unearth-Release,” the spirit of experimentation resulted in a successful piece. Phelps and the orchestra brought together opposite musical forces creating controlled tension. The first movement was characterized by a definitive fractured musical symmetry emphasized by the viola, harp and piano. Transitioning into a faster and brighter second movement, the piece was accentuated by frenzied passages. The third movement highlighted the piece’s overall structure, never creating a definitive statement but providing an all encompassing soundscape as a big-picture, musical idea. 
Thornton’s spirit of experimentation and effort in breaking new boundaries is something to be celebrated among student composers. No matter how contemporary music is conceived, the pieces that were performed on Friday are perfect examples of the progress that  composers have made.

Situated on East 3rd Street in the Arts District is Salt & Straw, an ice cream shop ready to take downtown Los Angeles by storm. The Portland-based ice cream shop has expanded its California locations, with this new shop offering those living in Downtown a shorter drive from other parts of Los Angeles to experience the shop’s uniquely delicious ice cream flavors.
The smell of waffle cones wafting through the air precedes the shop itself. Upon entering, the atmosphere is initially set with incandescent light bulbs floating above and striped wood adorning the walls. A hand-crafted shelf holds the shop’s “Meet our Muses,” where local businesses showcase their favorite items of the moment, such as organic chocolates or homemade spices. The opposite wall holds another shelf that contains different Salt & Straw merchandise that customers can leisurely look at as they make their way to the counter.
Breyona White | Daily TrojanSweet cream · Portland-based ice cream shop Salt & Straw currently has four locations in L.A., with its newest location in the Arts District.
The menu hanging above the counter showcases 12 classic flavors written in chalk, eliminating the overwhelming feeling common in ice cream shops. One of the most beautiful aspects of Salt and Straw is the ability for customers to sample as many flavors as possible without causing problems to workers and other customers. Without a sense of rush and a smile, the employees hand out small, metal spoons for each customer to sample the complex flavors offered in the shop. Stepping out of one’s comfort zone is a must, as the employees encourage patrons to try flavors typically thought of as incompatible. Among the flavors sampled, six immediately stood out from the rest: silencio black tea and coconut stracciatella, black olive brittle and goat cheese, avocado and strawberry sherbert, freckled woodblock chocolate, honey lavender and sea salt with caramel ribbons.
Each ice-cream flavor was crafted to showcase the complex components within each, rather than override them with sugar. The black olive brittle and goat cheese was extraordinarily smooth, while the silencio black tea and coconut stracciatella encompassed a true herbal essence of tea. Both the sea salt with caramel ribbons and avocado and strawberry sherbet successfully married sweet and saltiness for a delightfully balanced treat. As an avid chocolate connoisseur, the freckled woodblock chocolate was a homerun from the shop, with the chocolate bursting with pure cocoa bean flavor. The star of the show, however, goes to honey lavender, with each bite blooming with lavender herb flavor and finishing with the delightfully light sweetness of honey. Along with these classic flavors, the shop offers seasonal series throughout the year.
For those who are wary about these more adventurous flavors, the shop offers more common flavors such as single origin Amadeus vanilla and salted, malted chocolate chip cookie dough. Each hefty ice cream scoop can be placed in either a cup or a waffle cone, which is freshly made throughout the day. Customers can enjoy their dessert on a bench along the wall or while walking around Downtown. If in a rush, the shop offers a pint fridge for easy to-go ice cream that can be purchased at the counter.
The new Salt & Straw location is a must try for those in Los Angeles and the perfect complement to a weekend out and about or a sweet end to the night. This new location is destined to continue the success already established by the company and is an appropriate addition to the charming Arts District.

Photo from InsecureAwkward · Issa Rae (above) plays a fictional version of herself in the new HBO series Insecure. The show has received acclaim from critics.
As the year comes to an end, streaming platforms and networks are rolling out new shows every week as competition becomes increasingly more intense and the market becomes even more crowded (Spotify is set to launch its own content this next year, just to give you an example). 
Two major streaming titans, Netflix and Amazon, have both premiered multiple shows in the last several months (the latter of which has had a fairly quiet rollout of Woody Allen’s not-so-great A Crisis in Six Scenes). Although HBO began on television, it’s move to streaming platforms HBO Go and HBO Now has opened up a new way to enjoy the network’s content— and so when presented with the opportunity to premiere their newest half-hour comedy Insecure to audience members, HBO decided to debut it online almost a month prior to its original air date, a move presumably made to drum up interest and viewership the more the pilot lives online. 
Insecure stars Issa Rae as Issa Dee, a late 20s black woman living in Los Angeles, and is based on the web series Rae created in 2011 called The Mis-Adventures of Awkward Black Girl. In the opening scene, Issa tells a group of young elementary school kids: “black women aren’t bitter, they’re just tired of being expected to settle for less.” The kids don’t really understand her, but the audience sure does: more than a comedy, this show will carry weight. Although the title might suggest otherwise, Insecure’s creator Issa Rae has shown in just two episodes that her voice is sure-footed and confident, and exactly what audiences need.
In the show, Issa works at a non-profit called We Got Y’All, aimed at helping young inner city youth. But as Issa puts it, even though her boss founded the nonprofit to help people “in the ‘hood…,” “she didn’t hire anybody actually from the hood.” And so much to Issa’s chagrin, she becomes the “token” black woman in the office space. However, Issa doesn’t want to play that role, so when her very white co-workers ask her to explain the term “on fleek,” Issa looks at them blankly and says “I don’t know what that means.” A second later in narration, she tells the audience, “I know what that sh-t means. But being aggressively passive is what I do best.” 
Back at home, Issa’s deadbeat boyfriend of four years Lawrence (Jay Ellis) can’t get his “business proposal off the ground” and Issa fantasizes about breaking up with him. Meanwhile, Issa’s best friend Molly (Yvonne Orji) can’t find a steady man to date. Issa lovingly describes Molly as “the Will Smith of corporate. White people love Molly. Black people love Molly.” The two are tied at the hip; Issa the yin to Molly’s yang. In the pilot episode, the two meet at Merkato (an Ethiopian restaurant on Fairfax Avenue) afterwork to complain about guys and their love life. Later in the episode, when Molly needs a pick me up, Issa forces her to dress up and go out. A particularly funny— and insightful— moment occurs when they arrive at the club and Molly complains: “Issa, why are we in 1997 Inglewood?”
Of course, there are familiar tropes in Insecure. When Issa tells her boyfriend “We’re not about to be the black couple fighting in Rite Aid right now” and turns away from him, she skulks back a second later, asking if she can use his Rite Aid card “for the discount.” Lawrence shakes his head in disbelief, then leaves the store as Issa hangs her head in almost mock shame. 
This type of unabashedly dependent moment in the wake of a flurry of independent action is not foreign to the genre of independent unruly women. We’ve seen a similar moment no doubt in Girls, or The Mindy Project or Broad City. I can almost see a similar scene in Girls as Lena Dunham’s Hannah stomps off camera— be it away from her parents or her boyfriend or her friend— only to return a second later begging for something from them. And while a moment like this might feel tired, Insecure’s voice found in Issa Rae makes it entirely fresh.
Insecure also paints such a specific portrait of Los Angeles. Green palm trees and open skies are nothing new to the city’s visual history, but the often ignored parts of Los Angeles are the parts that shines in Insecure. Mostly, it just makes the show feel more real and genuine.
In the second episode, a former flame tells Issa: “Every black girl that went to college likes Drake.” At first, she’s affronted, then admits “He just really gets us.” Maybe not every girl that goes to college will be like Insecure, but there’s bound to be a group who feels that Issa just really gets them. And that’s what making and telling stories should be about.

Photo courtesy of G2 GalleryArtistic value · Monika Basse graduated in 2016 with a Master of Arts in curatorial practice and the public sphere. She has worked at multiple institutions, such as the Lois Lambert Gallery at Bergamot Station.
Several months after graduating from USC, Monika Basse found herself in a strange situation. 
The G2 Gallery, a photography gallery in Venice Beach, recently hired the USC alumna as its curator. 
Though most curators step into their roles after several years of post-grad work experience and generally hold a Ph.D in art, Basse was hired directly out of Roski’s M.A. program in art and curatorial practices in the public sphere. She brings an impressive resume to the job, having worked at Christie’s auction house and LACMA.
Basse is committed to upholding the gallery’s mission of promoting conservation through nature and wildlife photography. 
“My aim is to curate stimulating exhibits that engage the community in a dialogue about preserving earth’s varying environments while also reminding visitors of their love of nature,” Basse said.
G2’s mission is to promote conservation through nature and wildlife photography. It donates its proceeds to environmental causes including Audubon California and Greenpeace. Their gift shop sells sustainably-made products and handicrafts from local creators. 
Though Basse has only been at G2 for five months, she has already undertaken one ambitious project, an installation called “100 Years of National Parks: The West” that is currently on display. Robert Glenn Ketchum provided additional curatorial support in the installation’s early stages.
The exhibit is the fourth in series commemorating the centennial of the National Parks Service. Previous installments of the series used only one to two rooms of G2’s space, but Basse has decided to honor the diversity and number of national parks in the American West by using all of the gallery’s four rooms. 
Many of the 64 paintings in “The West” were printed especially for the exhibit, which features a total of 35 artists. At the gallery’s opening on Oct. 4, the artists met each other for the first time, and Basse said that she felt proud of the group’s diversity. 
“Some of them have 30 odd years of experience, and some are just starting out,” Basse said. “It was a great kind of intermingling.” 
Next on Basse’s agenda are exhibits focusing on the national parks of Hawaii and Alaska. Though her predecessor planned to include those states in the current installation, Basse felt that the uniqueness of America’s youngest states warranted separate treatment. For now, visitors can see the 11 states of the continental West represented in the present display, which runs until Dec. 24. 
Basse said that stepping into the curator role so early in her career has been an exhilarating experience, and she’s enjoying learning the ropes. G2 originally reached out to Roski seeking to hire a PhD fellow, but they were instead directed to Basse, who was floored by the offer.
“Nobody really assumes that they can just do the job that they went to grad school for immediately out of grad school,” she said.“[But then] nobody really grows up dreaming to be a curator.” 
Basse’s says that she “very organically” came to realize that art curation was her calling and advised current students to follow their passion, even if it doesn’t have yet a clear career path. 
“If you have a passion, you should let that passion grow organically, even if it doesn’t quite make sense. Even if you’re like, ‘That’s not a job,’ it will slowly sort itself out,” Basse said. “That’s the beauty of living in 2016.”

Julia Erickson | Daily TrojanAwards on lock · Senior midfielder and defender Savannah Levin was named the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week Tuesday.
Returning home after a 2-0 win at Arizona State, the No. 5 women’s soccer team welcomes Washington State to McAlister Field on Thursday. The Women of Troy had their program-record 10-game winning streak halted against Cal two matches ago, but they rebounded with a clean shutout of Arizona State over the weekend. Now, they hope to work on a new streak, starting with two in a row against the Cougars.
Last time out, USC got back in the win column thanks to goals from redshirt senior forward Katie Johnson and senior midfielder and defender Savannah Levin, along with another shutout from redshirt senior goalkeeper Sammy Jo Prudhomme. The Women of Troy’s success so far this season has been built on a high-octane, but unselfish offense — and a stone wall between the sticks.
Johnson’s seven goals are tied with senior midfielder Morgan Andrews for the most on the team, and four other players have chipped in with multiple scores this fall, including six from redshirt junior forward Alex Anthony. A whopping nine Women of Troy have also recorded more than one assist, and Prudhomme has conceded just seven goals in 14 games. Prudhomme now has nine clean sheets on the year and has let in two goals on just one occasion: the team’s season opener at Santa Clara. Simply put, the Women of Troy score often and are rarely scored against — an effective, if not revolutionary, strategy.
USC is currently the fifth-ranked team in the nation, but head coach Keidane McAlpine’s group is looking up at four schools in the Pac-12 standings. With five games left to play in the regular season (all in-conference matchups), the Women of Troy are within spitting distance of the conference summit, as Colorado, Cal, Stanford and Utah are all within a game of USC. A matchup against Washington State (1-5 in Pac-12 play) might be just what the Women of Troy need to make up that short gap. Utah and Colorado take on both Northern California teams in this week’s slate of games, making it a prime opportunity for USC to catapult itself into the Pac-12 lead.
The Cougars won’t be easy prey, however. Although USC edged Washington State 1-0 in both of the teams’ previous two meetings, the Cougars claimed a 2-0 victory the last time they visited Los Angeles. They grabbed their first conference win of the season a week ago against Arizona State but lost to Utah in their most recent game. Washington State is yet to win on the road this year, and the Women of Troy will look pile on and hand the Cougars their sixth loss in seven matches.
The Women of Troy will kick off at 2 p.m. on Thursday before returning to McAlister Field on Sunday to host Washington.

Photo from TwitterDebate time · Wisconsin’s star basketball player, senior Nigel Hayes, was featured on ESPN’s College GameDay with a controversial sign. The sign was meant to continue the conversation about college athletes being paid.
One of the greatest traditions in all of college football is the College GameDay poster. ESPN’s classic traveling Saturday preview show at whatever campus is deemed host to the biggest game that week always inspires fans to get creative in their attempts to land on TV. Whether it’s the Ole Miss fan proclaiming “Nick Saban Skips Leg Day” or the Michigan State fan noting “Even Gandhi Hated Ohio State,” some of the most creative signs always go viral.
The best sign from this weekend’s show before the Ohio State vs. Wisconsin game in Madison wasn’t from a rowdy fan, though. Instead it came from Nigel Hayes, the star player on Wisconsin’s men’s basketball team. In bright red, all-caps, Hayes’ sign read “Broke College Athlete Anything Helps.” At the bottom, he included the name of a Venmo account, in hopes of soliciting donations. 
Of course, Hayes meant for the sign to be ironic, and he later said that he would be donating any money sent to the listed electronic banking account to a local Boys and Girls Club, not keeping any of it. He’s not actually broke. He was simply taking the opportunity to voice his opinion on the issue of athlete compensation in college sports. It’s an issue that’s more complicated than it might seem on the surface, but nonetheless deserves a much better answer than what currently stands under the status quo. 
Hayes makes an interesting spokesperson for the issue. While he is maybe not the most in need of any immediate compensation for the value he adds to his athletic department, he is one of the most deserving based on the actual value he brings. 
Hayes, a senior, considered entering the NBA draft last year and was projected to fall somewhere in the second round. He likely wouldn’t have jumped right into a multi-million dollar contract and signing bonus with an NBA team, but very easily could have been making an actual salary playing basketball either in the NBA’s developmental league or in a European professional league. He instead turned it down, opting for another year of exposure and development with a top college program — plus the ability to finish his degree, something he expressed as a key factor — before attempting to take his talents to the NBA. 
In other words, Hayes clearly finds a lot of value in the scholarship awarded to him by Wisconsin. But given his status as one of the best players in the country, he almost certainly brings way more value to the table within the Wisconsin athletic department. 
According to a University of South Florida study, the marginal annual revenue brought to a school by the average five-star basketball recruit is $625,000. For a four-star recruit, it’s $178,000. And that’s only factoring how the improved competitiveness of the given team allows the school to sell more tickets and attract more viewers on TV. It doesn’t even project the long-term increase in financial donations to a university from having a proud and competitive athletic program. 
These numbers are so high because of the new TV contracts conferences are signing. The Big Ten conference as a whole sold its broadcast rights of football and basketball games for $440 million a year as of next year, meaning Wisconsin will get about $44 million a year directly from those broadcasts. 
The tuition that Wisconsin, a public university, covers for Hayes, an out-of-state student, is worth about $47,000 a year. 
The disparity between what football and basketball players generate and what they receive in return are staggering. It certainly begs the question of why the NCAA requires these players to maintain an amateur status, only to be compensated by their scholarship and benefits rather than any sort of wage or salary. 
The answer has to do with where all that money goes. A lot of it goes to athletic directors, head coaches, new facilities and other staff members of the football and basketball programs. But contrary to popular belief, it doesn’t all go there.
In fact, a huge percentage of it goes toward funding the non-revenue generating sports. This includes essentially every men’s sport besides football and basketball and every single women’s sport. 
In a lot of cases, the expenditures of non-revenue sports leave certain athletic programs with a deficit over a given year. For example, eight of the 10 public Pac-12 schools had program deficits in 2014, despite generating millions in revenue from their football programs. Even Florida State, the defending national champions in football in 2014, spent more money on athletics than it generated in revenue that year. 
Another interesting note is that for some of the biggest and most successful sports programs that do come out in the black during a given year, some of the revenue actually goes back into the overall university budget. Wisconsin, for example, will spend more than $100 million on its athletic program in a given year, but it generated enough revenue to give $11.5 million in revenue back to the school after covering all its expenses last year. Yes, Badgers head coach Paul Chryst already makes a seven-figure salary, but the revenue he and his program generate doesn’t go straight into his and his staff’s holiday bonuses. 
So the real question is not whether universities have the money to pay athletes. They do. It’s whether paying athletes is really in the best interest of all student athletes and the school as a whole. 
If every scholarship athlete in a Power Five conference participated in something like a work study program, they would start earning an hourly wage for any work they put in for their team. It would be a very significant additional expenditure for the department as a whole. It makes sense for football and basketball, but it makes much less sense for the non-revenue generating sports. The result would likely be fewer scholarship opportunities and even a reduction in the number of programs that schools can offer. 
A complete free market disruption of college athletics, where Heisman-winning quarterbacks are signed to actual contracts worth as much as their head coaches, would also probably result in fewer schools offering full scholarships to backup lineman or journeyman special team players. Either way, someone besides university administrators and Nick Saban would see reductions in the benefits they receive from participating. 
There will likely be a big shift in the direction of athletes’ compensation in the near future, as the tides are certainly turning. But it’s ultimately an issue too complicated to resolve in a newspaper column, and especially on a College GameDay poster.

Benjamin Dunn | Daily TrojanStep it up · Sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett is expected to take the role of junior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. who tore his ACL.
The Trojans took practice at a relaxed pace on Tuesday, taking full advantage of their bye week to rest up a set of battered players still recovering from injuries. 
On the offensive side, senior running back Justin Davis is sitting out with an ankle injury and junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster is nursing a back injury. Redshirt senior offensive tackle Jordan Simmons is also suffering from knee tendonitis, and senior defensive back Leon McQuay III is struggling with injuries to his hip and groin.
All four of these players will be back, but need this week to recuperate. The same is not true, however, for redshirt junior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr., who roped in 24 receptions for 226 yards and one touchdown this season. Mitchell is out for the season with a torn ACL, leaving sophomore wide receiver Deontay Burnett to step up into his starting position. 
“I told him that I’m gonna play for him,” Burnett said. “I told him every time I’m on the field, it’s gonna be for him. He just told me to be who I am.”
With several seasoned players sitting out on Tuesday, head coach Clay Helton mixed in a younger squad of athletes for a practice that barely lasted over an hour. Helton praised many of the younger offensive players, including freshman quarterback Matt Fink and freshman wide receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe, for their performance.
“I look at those two groups there at the end in that last period, and you say, ‘Gosh dang, there’s the future of your football team,’” Helton said of the players who got extra opportunities Tuesday. “There’s some talented young kids here, and this is quality reps for them to try to grow.”
Helton also offered up praise for senior leaders who have stepped into the spotlight this year. With Davis remaining on the sidelines, sophomore Ronald Jones II is getting more touches on the ball — and it’s paying off for the young running back. Jones started against Arizona and rushed 77 yards, scoring one touchdown. 
Teammates also recognized the continued success that Sam Darnold has had for the program, notching a 3-1 record as a quarterback. Jones described Darnold’s play in the pocket as “electrifying” and offered steep praise for the quarterback’s ability to scramble.
“That one play he had against Colorado, when the ball fumbled and he threw it back, it kind of reminded me of Johnny Manziel,” Jones said.
The team will need to stay in form throughout the next week, as they ready to face Cal for a Thursday game at home after a bye week break.

Lisa Kam | Daily Trojan
Millennial bashing brings a certain sort of violent pleasure to all those over 50. Words like “entitled,” “babies” and “softies” are tossed over the generational divide like in the days of trench warfare. Unsurprisingly, most millennials feel this judgement is unfair and rather ironic, for they see themselves unlearning and fixing the social problems that older generations perpetuated. 
One such problem that they feel the need to rectify is for the exclusion of minorities. Safe spaces have popped up all over college campuses for minorities to find refuge in a break from prejudice. There are debates scattering the Internet over whether or not these spaces are a good idea or a liberal assault on freedom. However, one such safe space has taken the concept to a whole new level by catering to the one group that no one ever thought would need one: heterosexual males. It’s a clever take on a liberal-protected practice, but ultimately falters when it comes to making impactful change. 
University of Redlands’ student organization, DUDES — standing for Dudes Understanding Diversity and Ending Stereotypes — sounds more like an SNL sketch than an unusual take on the concept of the safe space. The idea that everyone is oppressed and needs a safe place to talk about issues is justifiably part the reason many older people are trashing college campus environments as of late, culminating in the University of Chicago’s ban on safe spaces. The heterosexual males at University of Redlands having the audacity to create a safe space to discuss their issues is a blow to hardcore liberals who are steadfastly convinced that these men sit around all day in a palace of pure gold, accepting Wall Street job offers and waiting to date-rape women. The truth is that most people, regardless of minority or privilege status, have issues and questions that would best be discussed with others in the same position. The guys in DUDES tackle big issues such as pornography and “authentic masculinity” in order to create a college campus that is inclusive for everyone. There is little reason to believe that DUDES is not having a positive impact on those who attend to “unlearn” traditional masculinity.
However, it is hard to believe that these boys have nothing better to do than sit around and talk in a circle every week about the way others perceive them. Surely, the attendees for DUDES are doing a lot of talking and discussing, which is the golden mark of real learning according to most liberal universities. In fact, the most important part about a college degree is not the knowledge acquired but the ad infinitum, circular discussions where no one is wrong, but respectfully disagreed with. Saying that someone is wrong would be too exclusive, and then a safe space would have to be made for them too. 
Though a bit over-the-top, the concept of safe spaces makes sense when college students operate in an learning environment where stereotypes have become the main enemy, not hunger, homelessness or the refugee crisis.
 But stereotypes leave no one labeless — even straight white guys.
Stereotype has become one of the worst words in the English language. Unless what is being discussed is the periodic table, everyone better keep their observations to themselves. Of course, it is useless to attack the entire concept of stereotypes and the nuanced arguments for and against them in our society, but for all intents and purposes, in general, stereotypes are considered to be bad. The most liberal, proactive college students want to combat stereotypes and make it their mission to do so. Nevertheless, few dare to add the question at the end of their discussions with free pizza: so what? So what that maybe, 10 people engage in a discussion that might be eye opening but most likely forgotten within a couple hours? Of course discussions where students unlearn ideas are thrilling. Men being told they do not have to be macho or look at pornography must feel like a weight they can’t even lift in the first place has been removed from their shoulders. But does there really need to be a whole club devoted to this sort of stuff? 
A great many students erroneously think that a discussion will fix everything. In the case of DUDES, these young men are simply changing the way they perceive themselves and the standards to which they are held. In reality, they are hardly changing anybody’s opinion on straight males. When it comes down to it, the majority of hiring managers in the workfield will not think twice about the fact they face certain negative biases about masculinity because someone is a hetereosexual male. To some degree, safe spaces have a purpose of not only providing refuge but awareness to the majority communities. Minorities face biases, especially in workplaces, and being part of a cohesive group can help raise awareness. When a majority, like straight males, come together to talk about their specific challenges, they are drawing attention to themselves in a harsher light. They are the last group to come together to raise awareness for their plight. Nevertheless, their problems are real problems. Pornography is a real problem. The expectation of testosterone-fueled masculinity is a harsh reality for many young men who do not feel like they live up to that expectation. But it is surprising that an entire club is devoted to these questions. Perhaps these men are doing what they have always done, just under the unusual label of “safe space” which has caused alarm among confused liberals. The point of a safe space is when these negative biases affect day to day life and opportunities — a category under which DUDES do not fall.
Ultimately, these young men can spend their free time however they wish. If organizing discussions that should be already happening naturally amongst friends is what needs to be done, then so be it. However, creating a “victim-status” from being a straight guy is only confirming what the older generation thinks of millennials. There is real action to be taken on college campuses that includes much more effort than sitting in a circle. 
I agree DUDES is a ridiculous, notion – but then again – ALL safe spaces are.
Bwaahahaha!!  DUDES… This is hilarious.  I feel like I am in the middle of the movie, The Big Lebowski.  Life imitates art far more than art imitates life.
Manufacturing an issue is one thing, but inventing descriptors is another – to wit – “violent pleasure”.  Did you invent that in a safe space?
No one deserves to be insulted, verbally abused, slighted, etc. Certainly, nasty personal comments about race, religion, appearance, gender identity, etc. are disgusting and low. This is obviously undesirable at USC. Sadly, this happens in the outside world and always will.
A “safe space” at USC is counterproductive. It is merely a way of forming weaklings unable to withstand others’ verbal aggression. Still, if USC, God forbid, decides to implement this kind of inane action, may it help its graduates to find employment where all is sweetness, kindness, sisterhood and brotherhood. If USC cannot place its graduates in such paradises, it is failing to help them prepare for the careers they hope to achieve . . . in our world, one lacking safe spaces to coddle and protect them.

This week on Mom’s Pick, I’m exploring the eighth wonder of the world: Parliament’s funky album from 1976, Mothership Connection. Surprisingly, I don’t even think this album belonged to my mom; If anything, it’s probably my dad’s. Nonetheless, it’s still in the family, just the wrong parent.
To be perfectly honest, I really can’t imagine either of my parents listening to this album without being stoned. The space-centric album is definitely… out of this world. I actually had the privilege to see George Clinton, Parliament and Funkadelic frontman perform last month alongside relics such as Miguel Atwood Ferguson, BadBadNotGood and Nai Palm. Listening to this album after seeing him perform clicked and he’s still got the funk as a 75-year-old man.
The album featured members of James Brown’s backing band, Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley for the first time. Mothership Connection is regarded to as one of Parliament’s best work, the first to actually go platinum in sales.

Though only seven tracks long, the funk is overwhelmingly overt. The album begins like you’re entering a new dimension, broadcasting live from outer space. “P-Funk (Wants To Get Funked Up)” invites listeners to “to get funked up,” through back-beat drums and strong horns. The bass line especially lures you in, hypnotizing you into a trance of funk. Being the first track, P-Funk succeeds in setting a consistent and central tone throughout the entirety of the album.
Notable tracks include “Unfunky UFO” and obviously “Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker).” “Give Up The Funk,” I feel, was the very first funky song I heard. It was a real introduction to funk with a catchy hook, catchy horns, and catchy instrumentation all together. 
The album is solid for the most part, but I was a little taken aback by the track, “Handcuffs.” Funky to say the least, it was also surprisingly objectifying towards women. A question occurred to me: Does this one song take away from the rest of the album? Yes and no. The album is undoubtedly a true masterpiece of funk, but I can’t look at it and not think about the very unnecessary and suggestive lyrics in “Handcuffs,” such as the line, “I think you won’t mind if I’d be possessive [of you], now would you?” It’s interesting to see how relevant this track is today in terms of feminism and women’s rights, especially with the current Trump fiasco.
That being said, remove “Handcuffs” from Mothership Connection, and it’s a smooth-sailing listen all the way through. To conclude, stay funky, don’t objectify women, and PLEASE don’t vote Trump.

Q: Do you have any advice for networking with internship coworkers and professors in a meaningful way? Thanks! — Shy and struggling 
“Trojan family, trojan family, trojan family!!” If you didn’t hear this phrase more than 34647132 times during orientation, perhaps you were at a different school’s. USC has one of the strongest alumni networks I’ve ever witnessed and networking is a quintessential component. 
Networking is the most useful skill to take away from your college career. You will meet people here at USC from all walks of life and they will be able to guide you in so many different ways. Networking isn’t solely about networking with established professionals. Networking amongst your cohort of peers is just as important. Some will become actors, others will become CEOs, etc. 
The best advice I can give? Be open, be honest, and put in the effort. Build relationships that matter. 
If you find a professor’s work to be interesting and you want to keep that relationship– talk to them about it! It won’t hurt if you say something like, “I really enjoy your work in XYZ field.” The art of good networking is making it seem natural. Get to know your professor’s hobbies, listen to your peers’ complaints, etc. When people find that you’re a good listener, they’ll naturally gravitate towards you. Then, when you want assistance with your career development– they’ll want to help! 
Also, this is a personal pet peeve but asking cliche questions like “Do you like the traveling involved with consulting,” will only render generic answers. Ask the bold questions. Ask questions that you find attributable to your life and the person you wish to network with. They’ll appreciate it! 
Lastly, remember the rule of threes. Always follow up within three days of talking to someone (preferably in the first 24 hours). If you want to keep in touch, make sure you check in every three months (if they’re not someone you see regularly). Keep that in mind as you foster the relationships you want to grow. Threes are awesome!
