With the Trump administration set to slash the Environmental Protection Agency’s budget by 31 percent, many recent environmental protections may be in jeopardy. This development has worried politicians such as Sen. Barbara Boxer, who spoke at Bovard Auditorium on Thursday as the keynote speaker for the Environmental Student Assembly’s Earth Month. 
In January, Boxer retired from the U.S. Senate, where she served from 1993 to 2017. She was previously the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives and served as chair of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 1993.
Boxer began her speech by discussing the relationship between science and politics in the modern world.
“It’s an odd world, filled with alternative facts, which I call authentic lies,” Boxer said to a laughing crowd. “We’re living through a time when science is so threatened that scientists have to march to show the American people that scientists are tellers of truth.”
Boxer also spoke about the injustice of climate change.
“We’re all taught to care about and stick up for the powerless,” Boxer said. “One of the reasons I was so attracted to the environmental issue is because it most often becomes an environmental justice issue.”
Joshua Blockstein, the co-director of ESA, spoke about California’s environmental policy in an introduction for Boxer.
“We need to look no further than our own state for evidence that we can take the initiative to revolutionize environmental policy,” Blockstein said. “California has taken the necessary steps to tackle climate change and protect our natural environment.”
Jacob Lind, a freshman studying English, decided to come to the event to hear about Boxer’s political opinions in the Trump era.
“She’s a political veteran, so it’s interesting to hear her take on the current turmoil,” Lind said. “She’s now a private citizen like the rest of us, but she has a kind of insight into the situation of Donald Trump being president.”
Boxer’s presentation was followed by a panel featuring Bonnie Reiss, global director of the USC Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy; Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation; and Mary Nichols, chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board.
Congrui Lin, a senior studying human biology, is an intern for  Sen. Dianne Feinstein, and came to the event to learn more about California’s environmental policy.
“I think that the cap-and-trade plan has been very successful, and so we should keep aggressively pursuing that and transitioning towards a cleaner economy,” Lin said in reference to California’s policy limiting greenhouse gas emissions. 
Rebecca Weber, co-director of ESA, felt that Sen. Boxer was a perfect choice for a speaker for Earth Month.
“Our mission is to engage, inform and empower the student body about sustainability initiatives on campus, but it’s not just about campus anymore, especially with the new administration,” Weber said. “It’s good to make sure that students are informed about what’s going on.”
To close her speech, Boxer called for students to take action on environmental issues.
“We have the responsibility to stand up, to speak out, to be tough and to fight back,” Boxer said.
Let’s hope the Football team’s playbook is not like the ‘Daily Trojan’ because if it is every play will be Student Body Left.
i wonder how much money Boer stand to make on this thing she calls climate change because i for one don’t believe in this  and the reason is the world is always changing . on its own

The Department of Public Safety removed at least 80 bicycles from campus on Thursday at the request of USC Facilities Management in preparation for the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books. 
Signs were posted on the affected bike racks about a week ago, warning students against parking their bicycles there after noon on Thursday.
Alexina Boudreaux, a sophomore majoring in computer science, was present while DPS impounded some of the bicycles. 
“Between Annenberg and GFS all the bike racks had signs on them that said bikes weren’t allowed after 12 p.m. on April 13th,” Boudreaux wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “I think around 1 p.m. DPS brought a big truck over and cut the locks on all the bikes on those bike racks and started putting the bikes in the back of the truck.”
According to DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle, the bicycles will be stored at a multi-level parking structure owned by USC on the other side of Interstate 110. Students whose bikes were impounded can contact DPS to retrieve them at no cost. 
Students must either have their bicycles registered or be able to identify them in order for DPS to return them. If a student’s bicycle is not registered, it must be identified by a “distinctive mark” and the make, model and color. For DPS to find a student’s bicycle that is not registered, it would be helpful for them to know the bicycle’s serial number, Carlisle said. 
The bicycle racks were removed along Trousdale Parkway and Childs Way to make space for upwards of 100,000 people and 400 booths that are expected on campus for the Festival of Books. 
The festival, which is the largest of its kind in the country, will be held at USC from April 22-23 this year.

From President to professor · Actress Kate Burton plays Vice President Sally Langston on ABC’s hit drama show Scandal. Photo from USC News
Kate Burton, a three-time Emmy and Tony Award nominee, will join the faculty of the USC School of Dramatic Arts as a professor starting this fall.
Burton earned a bachelor’s degree in Russian studies and European history from Brown University in 1979 and a master’s degree from Yale School of Drama in 1982. She is known for her work on both the stage and the screen. 
Burton made her Broadway debut in 1982 in a production of Noël Coward’s Present Laughter. In 2002, she received Tony Award nominations in two separate categories: Best Actress in a Play, for her role in Henrik Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, and Best Featured Actress in a Play for her portrayals of Pinhead and Mrs. Kendal in Bernard Pomerance’s The Elephant Man. She is one of five actors to be nominated for Tony awards in two different categories in the same year. In 2006, she received another Tony nomination for Best Leading Actress in a Play for her role in W. Somerset Maugham’s The Constant Wife. 
In the late 1980s and 1990s, Burton made several television appearances on shows such as Spenser: For Hire, All My Children and Brooklyn Bridge. More recently, she has made guest appearances on Law & Order, The Practice, The West Wing, Medium, Rescue Me and Grimm. 
In 1996, Burton was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for her appearance on ABC Afterschool Special. Burton is most well-known for her performance as Ellis Grey on the ABC medical drama Grey’s Anatomy, for which she received two nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in both 2006 and 2007. In 2014, Burton was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her role as Vice President Sally Langston on the ABC show Scandal. 
Burton has directed the plays Three Sisters, The Cherry Orchard and The Seagull for the Master’s of Fine Arts Acting Repertory at USC. She also taught at Fordham University and Brown University in the bachelor’s of fine arts and MFA programs, respectively. She has also directed two evenings of Shakespeare and Tchaikovsky. She is currently starring in the Broadway revival of Present Laughter with Kevin Kline. 
Under the leadership of School of Dramatic Arts Dean David Bridel, the school seeks to expand its professional influence and outreach and adopt a contemporary approach to performance training. As a faculty member at SDA, Burton will teach and direct undergraduate and graduate students. 
“[The] breadth and depth of her professional experience will be of great benefit to our students as we prepare them to enter today’s professional landscape,” Bridel told USC News. 
Burton is excited to start a new chapter in her career and to share her experiences and connections with the USC community. 
“I am greatly honored to be joining the faculty at USC and working with the wonderful Dean Bridel as he moves the School of Dramatic Arts toward new horizons,” Burton told USC News. “I have had some magnificent experiences working with the USC faculty and students over the last years and feel blessed to be asked to join them in a more profound way.”

On Thursday, the football team practiced at Howard Jones Field for the final time this spring. The Trojans will conclude spring ball workouts this Saturday with the team’s spring game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Thursday’s practice saw USC place a heavy emphasis on situational play between the first-string offensive and defensive units. The Trojans especially worked 11-on-11 drills in the red zone and near the goal line.
Defense finishes strong
The team concluded Thursday with a 2-point conversion drill pitting the offense against the defense. With the ball placed at the 2-yard line, the Trojan defense was successful in preventing the offense from scoring on three consecutive plays to conclude practice.
The defense forced redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold into throwing three incompletions — including an interception — during the 2-point conversion situation.
“We’ve got a lot of guys on the defense who bring amazing energy. That energy gives each of us a lot of confidence when we take the field,” said redshirt junior Ajene Harris, who intercepted a Darnold pass on the final play of Thursday’s practice. “It’s been all about communication [for the defense]. It’s our second year in the same system, so we are all beginning to be more confident about the play calls and schemes that we are running.”
The spring has seen strong performances from the Trojan defense. As a unit, it has received praise from the coaching staff.
The experience of this defense, you’ve got eight starters returning on that side and you have guys who have played a lot of football over their lives,” head coach Clay Helton said. “I thought today that they did a great job of situational mastery. [The defense] has played consistently this spring, all the way from practice one through now.”
Injuries alter spring game 
A significant number of players are currently battling lingering injuries that will prevent them from participating in Saturday’s spring game. Injured players include redshirt senior defensive end Kenny Bigelow, junior cornerback Isaiah Langley, junior linebacker Porter Gustin, redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe and junior tight end Tyler Petite, junior wide receiver Deontay Burnett, sophomore wide receiver Keyshawn “Pie” Young and freshman offensive lineman Andrew Vorhees. Helton noted that none of these players are dealing with season-ending injuries.
In response to the number of injuries, Helton announced that USC’s spring game will mainly focus on pitting the offense and defense against one another in game-specific scenarios. Some of the situations will include: a 7-on-7 session, working the offense near its own goal line, open-field live-tackling, red zone work and a two-minute drill. While there will be various situations played out on Saturday, the game will not include a scoring system, according to Helton.
Stressing a strong start
While it may be mid-April, getting off to a strong start in the regular season is already on the minds of the USC coaching staff. With summer workouts and fall camp still remaining this offseason, Helton is hopeful that a solid preseason program will propel his team to the strong regular season start it lacked in 2016.
“[Last season], everybody talked about us being one of the better teams in the nation — maybe even being a playoff-type team,” Helton said. “But the fact of the matter is that we lost three ball games early on. One of the things that we have to do to be able to have a really special year is to be able to start fast right from the get-go because every game counts.”

When the Golden State Warriors went ahead 3-1 in the NBA Finals last season, my editor at a local sports site I write for asked if anyone wanted credentials to the parade when they clinched the championship.
We were all certain that the Warriors would finish off the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 at home. In fact, I remember confidently tweeting something to the effect of: “The Warriors are in good shape. No team has ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals.”
So I jumped on the opportunity, requested time off of my internship and got excited for the chance to cover my hometown team’s championship parade for the second straight year.
I proceeded to spend the next week in panic mode, followed by going through the five stages of grief after the Warriors lost three straight games, blew a 3-1 lead (cringes) and became a walking social media joke.
 It seemed impossible — a team that had broken the regular season record with 73 wins and was dominant by historic proportions needed to win just one of three games against an objectively inferior team to bring home the title. Somehow, they choked it away in the grandest style.
Never have I hated sports more than the moment after the final buzzer sounded in that final game, when LeBron James and the Cavaliers stormed onto the Warriors’ home court in celebration, breaking hearts across the Bay Area and sending shockwaves through the entire sports world.
I remember watching the trophy presentation in my living room, then just sitting in shock for the next hour. The adrenaline rush that accompanied the thrill of the game quickly turned into depression. I felt robbed and devastated. 
As I watched the broadcast show highlights of the game with anchors talking about the Cavaliers’ historic comeback, I tried to convince myself that this was a movie (I’m still trying, to this day). My friends and I exchanged four-letter-word text messages because there was nothing else to say, really.
To follow a team almost religiously, to invest the time to watch their games and support that team for three-fourths of a year — only to have them lose by 4 points in Game 7 of the Finals is not a feeling I would want even for my worst enemy.
It’s also what got me thinking: Why do I care about sports so much? Why is it that I care so much about a stupid little game when non-sports fans go to sleep at night not able to name a single NBA team? Why do I keep watching sports, knowing that I’m basically signing up for a lifetime of heartbreaking moments and depressing losses that will ruin many of my days?
There are a lot of possible answers, but my big one is this: I keep coming back to sports because I love its spontaneity. I love how, at any given moment, anything can happen. Nobody can spoil it, and nobody can expect it. Everything’s live, happening in real time, and you’re almost forced into watching because you don’t want to miss a special moment.
When the Mississippi State women’s basketball team broke UConn’s NCAA-record 111-game win streak a few weeks ago, nobody planned it. When the miniscule Iceland soccer team made it to the quarterfinals of Euro 2016 by beating England, nobody could have conceived of that possibility. 
And even when baseball slugger Barry Bonds was chasing the home run record a decade ago, no one knew when or where he would hit that historic homer — you still had to watch the games, to pay attention, to invest in them.
Sports aren’t movies, nor are they books. Sports play out in real life, and they force you to be in the moment and vulnerable because you have no clue what’s going to happen next — one moment your team could be cruising to its second straight title, and the next, they’re blowing a 3-1 lead. 
Movies and books end the same way every time, no matter how many times you watch or read it. But in sports, you can take the same two teams and have them play 10 games, and every game would play out differently and end differently.
I watch sports because I want to see something special, because I could be watching the next perfect game in baseball or about to see a vicious slam dunk in basketball, a spectacular goal in hockey or soccer or an incredible punt return in football. 
Something else I’ve learned over the years of watching sports is that what goes around, comes around. For every heartbreak you experience as a sports fan, hope arises somewhere else that keeps your emotions in a manageable place. 
On Wednesday, I watched my hometown hockey team — the San Jose Sharks — steal a playoff game on the road, coming back from a 2-0 deficit and winning the game in sudden-death overtime. A script might’ve had the Sharks losing, and, based on where the game was at early on, that would have been an accurate prediction.
But sports don’t stick to scripts. They don’t play out the same way like every Adam Sandler movie or Nickelback song. Sports are like jazz: Every game, every quarter, every period marches to the beat of its own drum, luring in fans like myself who can’t get enough of the whimsical rhythm. 
The spontaneity of sports is what makes them enjoyable, intriguing and thrilling, and I’m more than willing to sacrifice occasional heartbreaking moments for the gratification of sweating out an exciting overtime playoff win. 
I’m still mad I didn’t get to cover that parade, though.

After last year’s hiatus, the men’s volleyball team clinched the No. 8 seed in this year’s MPSF Tournament. The Trojans, who lost seven out of nine matches to start the season, bounced back to not only double their 2016 total victories with a final 14-13 record, but to also finish tied for sixth in the MPSF. 
“We’re as ready as we get,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said. “We’re ramping up. We just won eight of the last nine. We went to Cal Baptist, which is an adverse situation, and we came away with the ‘W’ that we were looking for.”
Despite their string of victories leading into the tournament, the Trojans will be facing the No. 1 seed Long Beach State, who went 24-3 this season, in the first round of the tournament. While a seemingly difficult task, USC served them one of their three losses at the beginning of the season. Senior outside hitter Lucas Yoder, who is currently leading the nation in kills, senior middle blocker Andy Benesh, who is fifth in hitting percentage, and junior setter Gert Lisha, who is second in assists,  will be key in defeating Long Beach State again.
“We’ve got a lot of pieces right now playing at a high level,” Nygaard said. “We’ve got some guys playing some good volleyball. So now, it is a question of going in against the No. 1 team, which, philosophically speaking, is one of those things like, ‘Well, how do you think you’re going to do against them?’ Well, I think we have a better chance by playing them than we do sitting in the stands watching it.”
As it always is with the tournament, the Trojans now have two games versus Long Beach State to look back on and to use as preparation for this game. Since the first meeting, the team has progressed, yet was plagued with injury when the next meeting came around with Yoder not playing and sophomore outside hitter Gianluca Grasso just coming off an ankle sprain.
Nygaard believes that the first matchup was a showcase for his team when every player is healthy and contributing to the best of their abilities. The second game created difficulties for the team due to injuries, but he still saw potential in the way that his players battled against their opponents. This time, with all players healthy, Nygaard expects his players to be ready to bring the heat.
“You couple those together with the progression of where we are,” Nygaard said. “We have had a healthy starting lineup for at least the past three or four matches. I would look forward to competing at a high level.”
While making the tournament is always a goal, the team is also seeing it as proof of what the future holds for them. After a tough season last year, the Trojans have turned the program around in a short period of time, leaving their fans with hope for both this tournament and for the seasons to come.
Nygaard admitted that while the team isn’t the No. 1 seed, they are on the right path.
“The guys are starting to understand it,” Nygaard said. “They are embodying what we are trying to do. Are we done? By no stretch of the imagination because we are just above .500, so there is tons of room for growth. There is nothing but positive signs towards where we’re trying to get to.” 
Glad they made the playoffs. The eight wins to close the season were against Lewis, George Mason, Concordia, Sacred Hears
( took them 5 sets ), Harvard, UCSB, and Cal Baptist twice. All were at home except last match. The one loss vs. the ‘ruins was a disgrace being swept at home easily. Lose both Yoder and Benesh for next season so new recruits have to be top drawer. Next season should be the make or break for Coach Nygaard if program really on the upswing.

On Thursday, the Aeneid Theatre Company performed a rehearsal for Rabbit Hole, a Pulitzer prize-winning play written by David Lindsay-Abaire. The story follows a family in the
heart-wrenching aftermath of a tremendous tragedy and engages the audience with not only its emotional content but also its unfiltered tale of grief, loss and healing.
The ATC is a student theater company dedicated to producing non-musical plays on campus. Each year, the group typically produces three non-musical plays spanning classical, contemporary and alternative theater genres. This past year, ATC has presented two widely successful productions, EQUUS and The Miser. Rabbit Hole is no exception to the company’s dedication to success — it is a phenomenal production to conclude the troupe’s artistic season.
Rabbit Hole originally premiered on Broadway in 2006 and  was consequently nominated for several Tony Awards, including Best Play. Since the Tonys brought the play nationwide recognition, it has been produced around the country, from Los Angeles to Philadelphia.
ATC’s production stars a small cast of Samantha Kofford, Ben Hirschhorn, Reese Brucker, Kimia Yazdi and Juan Duenas. The play was directed by Rachel Russell, a junior majoring in theater with an emphasis in acting. Russell expressed that while acting has always been her passion, she has a unique love for directing. Her artistic direction was stunning — she managed to capture the emotions of the piece in an array of creative aspects.
“I really wanted to draw people into this space,” Russell said. “That was one of the most important things for me: I wanted people to walk in and feel like they were in another world.”
For instance, one of the most striking details of Rabbit Hole is its inventive set design. Before the show, a series of videos showcasing an individual family are projected onto a large screen above the stage as the audience files in, taking their seats. The videos are complemented by somber, instrumental music, which effectively and compellingly sets the tone for the production.
These projections are strategically embedded throughout the show to enforce the dramatic elements of the play. In one scene, a character is watching home videos on the television, which are projected for the audience to watch simultaneously on the large screen. This artistic choice is a powerful narrative tool that magnifies the emotion of the scene. By engaging the audience in the plot itself, Russell allows the viewers to grieve alongside the characters — a technique that heightened the play’s overall captivation.
“The tapes are a critical part of the story,” Russell said, referencing the on-screen projections. “I thought that was a unique, beautiful, sensitive way to bring people into the space.”
Rabbit Hole was a extremely cohesive play for viewers.
Scene-to-scene transitions were seamless: Instrumental music filled the silence while characters moved into their next positions. The transitional music kept the audience invested throughout the entire piece, as it reinforced the drama and tension held within the play.
Despite its structural breaks,  Rabbit Hole poignantly portrays some of the most difficult emotions of the human experience, especially the sadness, anger and guilt parents face when losing a child. It captures these emotions beautifully and leaves the audience members with much to contemplate after the show’s final scene.
“While it is a difficult piece to watch, I hope that we dealt with the issues at hand with sensitivity,” Russell said. “That was really the goal.”
The play will run at the Cammilleri Hall at the Brain & Creativity Institute on Friday at 7:30 p.m. and 11 p.m., Saturday at 2:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets can be reserved on the ATC website. A $5 donation is suggested at the door.

I hold grudges. I also think there are two kinds of people who can’t hold grudges: The first are lovely girls whose exes break their hearts and reach out to get back together with them two months later. This type often says, “I don’t hold grudges.” The second category includes respectable, mature people who have a keen grasp of Christian charity. Whether or not this forgiving nature stems from a particular theology, these people have the ability to brush off particular events and move on.
Not me. Part of my learning curve has been to identify those who have hurt me and not let them be part of my life. For some, this means to forgive and forget. But I acknowledge that some things you just can’t move past.
When I got sick with cancer, I immediately knew who my real friends were. I can still remember who came out of the woodwork to send me a message that I didn’t expect. An acting teacher and a camp counselor both sent me multiple-paragraph Facebook messages and even followed up. A high school jock sent me a silk scarf in the mail and a handwritten note saying he simply felt he should do whatever he could to make me smile. A close friend who had stopped talking to me apologized. A USC friend sent me a weighted blanket.
My ex-boyfriend Hal said nothing. Hal and I had been incredibly close friends for over a year before anything happened between us. He had a crush on me for six months junior year, and I didn’t like him back. Then, I had a crush on him for six months, and he started dating someone else. Soon after they broke up, Hal held my hand during a movie on my high school campus. We kissed the next week. We broke up a year later to go to college.
Over winter break our freshman year, we had an incredibly awkward reunion. But when I got sick a year later, I expected my first love to go beyond liking my bald profile picture on Facebook. 
I expected one of my closest friends from high school to send me at least one word of support. Instead, two months after treatment, he
apologized. 
In the apology, he said “I” or “me” 23 times. He said “you” only half of that. Beyond the statistics of his message, I could feel him placating his own guilt. My senior year of high school, we wrote our future selves notes to open at our five-year reunion. I remember writing how in love with Hal I was, and telling future me to go hug him and say “hi” at the reunion. I plan on doing that if we’re both there, but I also sadly now have the answer high school me was never looking for. I wrote to myself that I couldn’t imagine he’d do anything that would keep him from being something special to me. But he ignored me when I was sick. I will never forget that. And I am unashamed that I demand more than he gave in order to fully forgive. 
So one of my grudges is against Hal. It doesn’t hurt me at all anymore. But I will not let it go until he volunteers me the energy I deserved for the six months I was so sick that I couldn’t read a book, walk up a flight of stairs or ride public transit. Must I let go of the hurt of his inaction in order to be considered a good person? 
Hal didn’t even know if I was going to recover. 
My second most persistent grudge is against Kat. She was great to me during treatment — she sang me a song and flew out to walk for a fundraiser with me. When I think about all that, forgiveness seeps in. But three months after treatment, when I returned to Los Angeles, my life
recently saved by chemotherapy, she said something truly insensitive. She made a remark against medicine advancement. To me, the pain of losing a friend was gentler than the pain of knowing a friend would so
deeply misunderstand the most pivotal moment of my life.
When I was sick, I desperately needed love — but I also needed medicine. I hope that one day curing cancer won’t mean the constant injection of terrible chemicals. But it does for now. And I believe that chemotherapy’s downsides are worth it for the lives it saves. I am unapologetic for not being able to be around people who believe otherwise.
I hold a couple of other grudges. They all lie in a moments when I realized something deep about the essence of my relationship with someone. The persistent resentment only pangs me once in a while now. I believe that it’s OK for someone to leave your life. I feel stronger for letting go, even if I don’t forget.

The Ricardo Montalban Theatre is a brightly lit, monolithic brick structure on Vine Street. The Hollywood Walk of Fame and the throngs of tourists it brings to the city’s streets serves as the hallmark of the L.A. entertainment
experience.
 The Rooftop Cinema Club has returned to the rooftop of the iconic Montalban Theatre for a third season of movie screenings — from cult classics to Academy Award-winning  favorites. Almost all tickets for movie screenings were sold out even before the screenings began in early April:  L.A. audiences are eager to experience a movie while surrounded by downtown Hollywood’s bright neon signage, looming billboards and sky-high buildings. 
The Rooftop Cinema Club hosts weekend and weekday screenings throughout April and May, but guests must have reserved tickets and be over 18 years old to attend.
 The view from the Montalban’s rooftop is breathtaking, although the flights of stairs up to the top — the only way up — leave guests breathless. Guests enter through a dimly lit, obscure gate on the right side of the Montalban, ascending to the roof through an outdoor staircase.
 A painted Audrey Hepburn portrait greets enthused moviegoers on their climb. The actress’ portrait adds to the glamorous bright lights surrounding the Montalban, and the Broadway Hollywood condos’ electric blue sign shines as the backdrop of the outdoor cinema theatre.
 Once at the top, guests check in at a small booth to receive wireless headphones and a soft navy blanket — complimentary additions to the movie-watching experience. Unlike modern movie theaters with plush leather seats, the Rooftop Cinema Club’s seats resemble comfortable lawn chairs.
 The seats line up in long rows, and since the chairs elongate to have the viewer naturally lean back, having a clear view of the screen is not a problem. Guests are able to choose their seats on a first-come, first-serve basis once they check in.
 Couples also have the option of buying a loveseat ticket, a two-person lounger with bottomless popcorn and two drinks, for a higher price. For those who don’t want to splurge or are simply looking to have a rooftop movie experience with friends, the navy blanket and snug lawn chairs already come with the basic ticket.
 Since movies are shown outdoors to the background noise of busy L.A. streets, headphones provide crisp, adjustable audio for the audience to enjoy. Nevertheless, there are still two small speakers in the back of the cinema space that play external audio, although muffled by wind. The only drawback of the wireless headphones is that it is difficult for guests to communicate during the movie, unless they entirely removed the audio gadget.
 The Rooftop Cinema Club’s last screening of the season will be held on May 31, but due to its overwhelming popularity, it’s almost guaranteed that the outdoor movie theater will be back for another season in Los Angeles.

Every college hopeful dreads the day they must make their way to a local high school, weave through a sea of nervous fellow students and take the test that will determine, in part, their future prospects. Standardized tests, particularly the SAT and ACT, reduce the skills learned from hundreds of hours spent in the classroom to a single test, taken one morning.
But what if this agony were optional rather than mandatory? More than 900 colleges and universities in the United States are test-optional, meaning students can choose whether or not to submit SAT or ACT scores when applying. This growing trend recognizes that standardized tests are not only an outdated way of measuring preparedness, but also an unethical one. USC must follow this momentum and also  go test- optional.
Higher education’s fixation on standardized testing has given rise to a billion-dollar industry responsible for disconcerting disparities between affluent high school students and their lower-income peers. Higher-income students can hire tutors and attend SAT or ACT “boot camps,” which can cost upwards of several thousand dollars. 
While wealthy students learn how to crack the code of the SAT or ACT, lower-income students may struggle to pool the resources necessary to understand the expectations of the test and the basics of taking it, let alone specific strategies to improve their chances of success. 
All students take the same test, so standardized testing supposedly creates a level playing field for students seeking admission to college. However, evidence suggests that standardized testing has become a faulty measure of preparedness that favors students from affluent backgrounds. 
In response, many colleges across the nation have begun to adopt test-optional policies. They’ve also found that these policies have increased diversity without sacrificing student quality. In 2014, William Hiss, the former dean of admissions at Bates College, published the results of a 30-year study examining 123,000 students from 33 public and private test-optional colleges. Hiss found that there were no significant differences in graduation rate or cumulative GPA between those who did and those who did not submit test scores on their applications. Moreover, those who did not submit test scores were more likely to be first-generation college students, Pell Grant recipients, women and students with learning differences — all historically disadvantaged groups who could benefit the most from college admissions.
USC has demonstrated its commitment to creating a diverse and equitable learning environment. At the University, we pride ourselves on granting opportunities to students of all backgrounds. We have one of the largest financial aid programs in the country, providing two-thirds of all USC undergraduate students some form of need-based aid. At the Foshay Learning Center, we provided academic support to first-generation students — 30 of whom committed to the University last year. In addition, one in seven of our Class of 2021 admits is a first-generation college student.
While the University has taken major strides to empower disadvantaged groups, making standardized testing optional would also reflect the University’s ethos on admissions. USC prides itself on its holistic evaluation of applications for admission, emphasizing that academic performance, while important, should only be one factor in determining a student’s acceptance. The University wants to find students who are well-rounded, not necessarily students who can get  a perfect score on a standardized test that, quite frankly, is not an accurate measure of college success. 
Most of the schools that have gone test-optional are small liberal arts colleges. By adopting this policy, USC has the opportunity to uphold its mission and pioneer these ideals among large, highly selective research universities. 
On balance, considering standardized testing’s role in perpetuating inequality and its inability to indicate a student’s preparedness for college, the right decision is apparent: USC should go test-optional.

It’s always a little alarming when the mouthpiece of a nationalist party flirts with Holocaust denial by claiming that Adolf Hitler did not use chemical weapons to kill people. Luckily for Americans of relative intelligence, Press Secretary Sean Spicer’s major faux pas was met almost immediately with a swarm of uproar, outrage and demands for retraction, answered by a recantation and apology. Ironically, the latest Spicer scandal also came during the same week as French presidential candidate Marine Le Pen’s controversial denial of the French government’s complicity and cooperation in rounding up Jewish citizens during World War II — an unfortunate and studied reality of the Vichy regime. To the educated observer, it would appear that the recent nationalist trends across the Western world might be bringing with them an erasure and ignorance of the very history that makes their resurgence so disturbing. 
Of course, every regime thinks of itself as comprising or protecting the “good guys”; every nation participating in World War I thought so, in the throes of their own nationalist and militaristic rhetoric. So too does President Donald Trump, who has so conveniently abandoned his “America First” ideology — for now — to follow the longstanding Republican tradition of ham-handed meddling in the Middle East. The concern is not whether Spicer, Trump or Le Pen really write off the Holocaust, or see themselves in the context of ethno-nationalistic superiority — it is whether they are thinking of these traditions of the Western world, and lessons learned from these tragedies, at all. Imagining a Europe of Le Pens and a United States under Trump makes it easy to see how the very same nationalism that bred the Holocaust is also giving hope to refueled neo-Nazi groups across the United States, encouraging hate crimes against immigrants and spurring anti-Muslim violence both here and in France. 
The problem with nationalists is that they are focused on the creation of an in-group, which necessitates the delineation of the out-group. They are not concerned with measured action because they demand rash, reactionary change; they do not value the virtues of reason and tolerance because they use violence to exhibit strength.  “Make America Great Again” has nothing to do with economic prosperity or world order. It is meant to harken back to a time of easily understood and clearly defined social hierarchies, and suggests that the in-group will once again be comprised of straight, white men. As a result, Trumplings tell non-white Americans to “go back where they came from”; their lack of whiteness makes them, by definition, a member of the out-group — and therefore not American. I doubt it needs to be spelled out, but Hitler also blamed German economic woes on Jews — and Roma, and homosexuals, and the other groups he wanted to exterminate. And exterminate them he did. Trump blames Mexican immigrants; Le Pen blames Muslim refugees. Trump has previously floated the idea of Muslim registries (or did we forget?); Le Pen wants to close French borders to the Middle East altogether. 
Both sides of the aisle in American politics have appropriated, misattributed, misused and bastardized the meaning of the terms “fascist” and “fascism.” Adhering to the true definition, the Trump administration is by no means a fascist regime. Neither, it could be observed, would Le Pen’s France be. But Trump is positioned remarkably well to imitate or, at worst, resurrect that authoritarian tradition. He is, of course, a demagogue with a loyal following he manipulates and maintains through modern forms of mass media; he delineates an ethnic in-group and out-group, inciting violence against the latter; his government is largely controlled — or at the very least, pushed around — by the far right, from the Freedom Caucus to Chief Strategist Steve Bannon; and he touts a return to traditionalist values as a reaction against what he argues is an economic downturn and the loss of national pride. 
It’s certainly not a surprise that Spicer has once again done what he does best: engineer national embarrassments and new lows for the administration. But it is alarming that two nationalist parties in the same week both seemed to suggest that it is becoming appropriate to rewrite the history of nationalism itself. Don’t let slips of the tongue lead to wholesale erasure. Nationalists are nationalists. Be warned.

It must be so wonderful to live in the blissful ignorance of Democrat and liberal politics. Liberal politics is unprincipled politics, because after all, policies of “whatever works for you” are by definition, unprincipled. There is no defending ignorant comments made by the likes of Spicer or Trump, but was the author of this piece of work equally disturbed when President Obama celebrated gay marriage as though he had been behind that fight all along? Or when Al Gore made his “U.S. Apology” tour across Europe, or the movement to rid the south of Confederate monuments as if they weren’t an important part of our Nation’s soul-searching, or any number of blatant attempts to suggest our nation wasn’t founded specifically on Judeo-Christian principles by mostly White Europeans? If none of those bother her, then I wonder if she’s troubled by the Democrat policy of “looking the other way” when it comes to illegal immigrants… a policy that disproportionately favours Latinos and Hispanics. Or perhaps she was troubled when California’s governor signed the law allowing driver’s licenses for illegals, saying that they can now “get to their jobs”. I wonder if she’s bothered by tax payer money in Los Angeles and some other cities going toward legal support for those who are (ironically) in the country illegally. Perhaps she was bothered by the increase in black unrest and civility under the Obama administration. Maybe, as an intelligent student at a quality university, she’s bothered by the wholesale trashing of science which tells us clearly that gender is binary, and can not be changed simply because some in society think you should be able to if you want to (again: “Whatever works for you”).
Sadly I suspect the author here is selectively bothered.

Thank God this is just an opinion. Your philosophy of life and politics has been tainted by the leftist dogma of progressive liberalism. You are so off-base when it comes to President Trump’s MAGA slogan, that it’s a shame your education has failed you. It is about global leadership of the free world.  It is about not allowing ourselves to be bullied by the UN, China, the Ruskies, ISIS. Its about economic freedom and prosperity for all Americans.  Your specific political associates and those whom you listen to have failed you, as they will portray President Trump is any negative light no matter what this administration does to give you more opportunities to succeed in life, career, hopes and dreams.  MAGA is about reversing all of the poor economic regulations, executive orders and of course that awful piece of legislation known as Obamacare.  All of the negativity that was spread throughout this country and the world during the ugliest 8 years of presidential history will be repal3d, replaced removed, ended.
I wake up every day thanking God that Hillary Clinton is not our president.
Happy Easter!

Jenny Chung | Daily Trojan
I would have never imagined being the news editor for the Daily Trojan my freshman year — but here I am, spending over 25 hours per week on the fourth floor of the Student Union building.
I love it here, probably because my co-editors actually laugh at my cheesy and dumb jokes. As one of the very few Latino freshmen studying journalism at USC, I sometimes find it intimidating to work with other students who are older and more experienced at news. Once I came to the DT, I never felt that way. I always felt welcome. I walk into the newsroom at 5 p.m. to the faces of the managing editors, who more than my editors have become a family for me. 
It is not uncommon for me to walk into the the newsroom, ready to vent at something to happened to me that day or about my discontent at some writers who forgot to turn in their interview recordings (yeah, we do that). Sonali, Danni, Diana and Eric have always been there with open ears and the best advice.
Working as news editor hasn’t been easy for me. Because I am a first-generation student, balancing schoolwork with DT work and getting used to being away from my parents has definitely taken a toll on me, but I am so willing to do it. I’m committed to providing the most up-to-date news and coverage to the student body.
Working with writers has given me the opportunity to interact with students that I normally would not talk to — often, it might be limited to shooting them an email last minute to go cover an event or to check out a protest (shout out to my writers who are always willing to do last-minute articles), and other times, it’s bonding over that one pointless class we’re taking and wish we could skip.
I hope to continue working in this office at the best publication on campus (I’m allowed to editorialize, right?). Knowing that we’re delivering confirmed, crucial news with the DT has taught me the ethics behind the profession I hope to continue with for my entire life.

When I made the decision to study abroad, I was in — even knowing that none of my family or friends would be in the same country, or in my case the same hemisphere. I knew that even though I was bound to make some awesome new friends, it wouldn’t be the same as hanging out with all my lifelong friends back home. With all that said, I had no idea that I would become my best friend while abroad.
Studying abroad is a great exercise in learning to do things for yourself and learning to make choices each day to do what makes you the most happy. Your best friend from home that also loves to get brunch on the weekends isn’t here but is that going to stop you from going to brunch? Well the first few weeks it might, but not now. All your friends are in class but you want to go to the beach, is that a problem? Nope. Back at home I wasn’t someone who I would have classified as an independent adventurer. I loved to do things, but I generally had someone with me. Here, things are totally different, and it has been one of the most valuable things about this experience.
I never knew how important it was to do things just because you want to do them, until I started doing it. That doesn’t mean not going with the flow and tagging along to something that wasn’t your first choice, but I’ve had a lot more free time here than I usually do at home, and I’ve been able to fill that with the things that I want or need to do.
Even mundane tasks such as going to the ATM or the grocery store that were initially intimidating in a foreign country have become a sort of reprieve for me. I greatly enjoy going for walks through the city and down to the waterfront to relax and clear my mind. While you’re studying abroad there is so much mental and emotional stress and stimuli that if you don’t take a break to let it all soak in, you are going to be very overwhelmed very quickly.
I’ve found that the best way for me to let my experiences marinate in my mind is to be alone. I love going window shopping and checking out the unique stores in downtown that are so unlike anything I’ve ever seen in Los Angeles. I love to sit by the water and watch the glamorous yachts come in and out of the port wondering who owns them and what they do for a living.

Spending more time alone also makes me appreciate the great relationships that I have with my friends and family, both here and back in the States. I wasn’t previously someone who minded grabbing lunch at Campus Center alone or waiting for my friends to get out of class by working on homework by myself for an hour, but now I’ve embraced how much more freedom I have by being able to do what I want, when I want.
At the end of the day, I feel so much better about myself on the inside knowing that I didn’t postpone or change my plans just to satisfy other people. Don’t get me wrong — I’m still a social person. I haven’t undergone a personality change and become a hermit, but I’ve realized the value in being able to spend a day alone. It’s liberating to be satisfying yourself just by doing something you want to do, whether that means reading in the park, grabbing lunch or running the errands I’d been putting off all weekend. I’ve been doing what I want to do, for the most important person in my life — me.

I headed out one night after a dinner in Persian restaurant Javan. It was late so I decided to call an Uber. The driver was a smiling elderly man. I shared a ride with a young woman who, like me, had just wrapped up a great evening.
When I stepped into the Uber, I immediately found myself in the middle of an interesting conversation. The young woman told the man how much trouble she had had, trying to find good veal. She wanted to make kofta, or Turkish meatballs. The Uber driver told her that he was Lebanese, and veal was one of his “staples”, so he knew where the good stuff was. He told her all his favorite stores and butchers in Los Angeles.
Ten minutes later, the young woman left the ride beaming. The driver turned around to face meand asked me how I was doing.
“I am good,” I said, ready for some conversation. “Where are you from in Lebanon, if you don’t mind me asking?”
He did not mind. He told me his story and asked me for mine. I told him that I was from Indonesia, that I came to the United States two years ago to pursue higher education.
“Indonesia!” he exclaimed. “I’ve never had Indonesian food before! Tell me, what is the best Indonesian restaurant in L.A.?”
Of course, L.A. being L.A., there is more than one great Indonesian restaurant. I regaled him stories of spicy leaf-wrapped rice, thick beef black soup, salad doused in peanut sauce. He sighed and shook his head. Confused, I asked him if I had said anything wrong.
Nothing was wrong, he said. He was just amazed at all the things he had discovered in L.A., all the food he had tasted. It was like finding the world in one city.
I thought about what he said — the world in one city. While the things I encountered here are not exact replicas of other countries around the world, I can’t deny that the influence of — well — everywhere in the world has left its mark on L.A.
There is that small enclave of Ethiopia in Fairfax. There is that mosque, built by a Libyan mother so her son who was going to school nearby had a place to pray. There is that Swedish candy shop, which sold the sourest sour skulls. There is Chinatown, Little Tokyo, Little Armenia, Olvera Street…you name it.
Walking around L.A. is an adventure in itself. You may find yourself taking a look at a different part of the world from one neighborhood to the next.

In light of months of construction delays and given the substandard state of existing facilities at the Element housing complex near USC, a group of students have taken legal action against Stuho, the Element’s parent leasing company. 
Element, located at the corner of Adams Boulevard and Hoover Street, was scheduled for completion in August 2016 and boasted new construction, furnished rooms and accessibility and proximity to campus. The complex targeted USC student tenants, with the catchphrase on their website: “If you are a USC student or someone who is just seeking a great place to live near USC, you have come to the right place!” 
Due to ongoing construction, students were relocated to the Da Vinci Apartments 4.5 miles from campus, and moved into the unfinished complex late November 2016. Once moved in, students faced ongoing construction on the pool, gym and main ground shops.
Alec Phillips, a senior majoring in environmental studies, one of his roommates, Connor McGlynn, a senior majoring in broadcast journalism,and Kieran Stolorz, a senior majoring in computer engineering and computer science are the main plaintiffs who have spearheaded legal action by officially serving Stuho a judicial summons in late November. There are five students currently involved in the lawsuit, with more planning to sign as the process proceeds. 
McGlynn says that he and his roommates initially tried reconciling the situation with Stuho to no avail.
“We had tried talking to Stuho and tried figuring out different solutions with them and had gone back and forth with their management team,” McGlynn said. “We found them unresponsive or not helpful with the solution. We felt like we were taken being taken advantage of. We felt [a lawsuit] was the best way to proceed.”
According to Phillips, tenants were given 20 percent discounts in the first few months of the lease 10 percent discounts once more of the facilities were completed. They are expected to pay full rent in the remaining months. But students believe they deserve greater compensation. 
Eventually, the five students hope to be reimbursed for their rent.
“We paid for something in a legally bound contract, and we weren’t given it,” McGlynn said. “So we don’t think it’s right and that [the leasing company] should profit from it.”
Case attorney Sean Chandra, who provides counsel to an organization that defends housing tenants, hopes to see Stuho compensate all residents, not just the students named in the suit, for the rent they have paid. 
“Not only did they continue to collect rent, but well before students were going to move in, when they were signing leases, [Stuho] promised students they could move in by the fall term last year even though they knew that the project would not be ready,” Chandra said. 
According to Chandra, Stuho benefitted from their false advertising.
“We don’t think that Stuho should be able to benefit from their lies,” Chandra said. “They lied that [Element] would be ready and if they hadn’t lied, they wouldn’t have as many tenants right now; if they had told people [Element] would be ready by November or December, nobody would have signed a year lease.” 
Currently, Chandra and his team are in the process of exchanging documents with representatives from Stuho to determine the facts of the case and compile evidence. A jury trial date has been set for September 26 in the event that the case is not settled. 
“We have a very compelling argument,” Chandra said. “If I were Stuho, I would be very eager to settle this case.”
This lawsuit follows issues such as leaking, flooding, cockroach infestations and experiencing loud noises from ongoing construction after move-in. 
“When we first moved in, there was still not a gym, pool or the restaurant they had promised,” Phillips said. “The apartment itself was extremely small and unfit for six people — there was not even a dining room table.”
McGlynn added that although the pool and gym are now finished, they do not live up to Element’s advertisements.
“We’re still pretty let down,” McGlynn said. “The pool is a 3 foot deep ‘wading area’ and the gym has about three treadmills in it. They sold it as a full-sized pool and full-sized gym.”
Element Property Management declined to comment on the lawsuit, as they stated that it is their policy not to discuss pending litigation.
“We feel it is important to respect the integrity of the legal process,” a spokeperson for Element Property Management wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “Our goal is for our residents to enjoy staying at Element and we will continue to focus on providing quality customer service.”
What is the quality customer service he/she is talking about?
I had to sue the company for the same reason back in 2008! They only act if they are sued and will settle with you before it goes to trial. You signed a contract and they breached it by not delivering the goods.

Formula racing immediately invokes the sentiments of speed and thrill. But before racecars can hit the track, they must be designed, constructed and tested.
Over 50 USC students work on this process every single day. These students are part of USC Racing, the university’s student-run chapter of Formula Society of Automotive Engineers.
USC Racing builds race cars from scratch every year and competes internationally against other universities. Trojans — ranging from freshmen to graduate students, and from engineering majors to business students — work on every aspect of the car. 
Anchal Jain, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, joined USC Racing at the beginning of his freshman year. Now the head of engineering and team captain, Jain was awarded the Gary Norris Promise Award for his dedication, leadership skills and creativity at USC Racing. 
“We try to have a culture that is based on keeping people excited about what we are doing and helping new members learn more,” Jain said. “Even though the project is really complicated, we don’t expect new members to have any prior experience, and the leads are responsible for teaching them.”
Within a year or two of joining the team, new students gain out-of-the-classroom skills that round them out to be capable engineers. Jain enjoys seeing the concepts from Computer-Aided Design computer models come to life. 
Another team captain is Abdullah Bundogji, a senior studying mechanical engineering. Bundogji began as a member of the powertrain sub-team, but is now the head of business. The powertrain sub-team is responsible for the design and development of all the engine subsystems and supporting systems.
“There was a need for funding on the team, so I picked up the role of contacting sponsors,” Bundogji said. “I listed all the companies down and I just picked up the phone and started calling them.”
During the fall of 2015, Bundogji and his team received a sponsorship of $10,000 from MK manufacturing, which funded machinery and material for their cars. 
 “I was already in the technical part of the team, but speaking with businesses is really fun because I get to network with people from different companies and different industries,” Bundogji said. “Our sponsors include big companies from the automotive and aerospace industry.”
Shantanu Mohta, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, joined USC Racing in his sophomore year. Mohta is the powertrain lead.
The progress of USC Racing was almost stopped in December 2016, when a fire broke out and the club almost lost their workspace in the back of parking structure A. The hurdle caused them to lose a few months of their development time.
“Getting over that has been a rough patch; we had to scrap some of our advanced designs and go to simpler ones just because of the time frame,” Mohta said. “Instead of having a two-three-month testing cycle, we are now reduced to two-three weeks.”
USC Racing’s chassis team has two leads, Luke Sanasarian and Kevin Jacques, who are both juniors majoring in mechanical engineering. The chassis team works on designing the suspension, brakes, steering and frame of the car.
”It’s a really rewarding experience to go out on the test day or go to the competition and see how well our car is running and how fast it goes,” Sanasarian said. “There are 80 other teams and everybody’s car is unique with different strengths and weaknesses.”
This year, while Sanasarian worked on the suspension and steering of the car, Jacques focused on optimizing the car’s frame. 
Jaques said that USC Racing has helped him get job interviews.
“One of my favorite parts about USC Racing is the opportunities it has opened up for me as far as my career is concerned,” Jacques said. “The last two jobs I have had are partially due to USC Racing.”
Another sub-team is the aerodynamics team, which is led by Bharath Ravishankar, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. Ravishankar’s primary responsibility is to lead and design the bodywork of the car.
“For a lot of us, this is the main thing we do outside of classes,” Ravishankar said. “Either you are in class, studying or you are at the shop working on something.” 
Yet, despite the time commitment, Ravishankar finds profound value in his work and in spending time with his friends.
“My favorite part is that I get to work with friends on something really cool for a lot of time,” Ravishankar said.
Mengqi Zhao, a graduate student studying materials engineering, is the composites manufacturing lead at USC Racing. 
“For everyone on the team, the main reason to join the team is we all love racecars,” Zhao wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “When I first joined the team, I didn’t have much experience working on the car. But all the team members taught me a lot.”
Yann Daniel Staelens, a senior lecturer in aerospace and mechanical engineering, has been the faculty adviser at USC Racing for four years now and teaches a 1-unit FSAE technical elective for mechanical engineers. Staelens gives the USC Racing team technical advice on designs and helps them with administrative and management issues.
“With student groups, it can sometimes have rough edges that we need to round off — and that’s what I am there for,” Staelens said. “To make sure that they stay consistent as a team and make sure to respect the deadlines as much as they can so that we can have a car to go to competition each year by June.” 
USC Racing is currently in the testing phase of its racecar for the upcoming competition, Formula SAE Lincoln that will be held from June 21 to 24. They finished 27th out of 80 last year and hope to be in the top 15 this year.

Katlyn Lee | Daily Trojan
Junior guard Elijah Stewart declared for the NBA Draft without an agent on Tuesday. The move was first reported by DraftExpress and confirmed by USC.
Joining sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright and redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron, Stewart is the third USC player to declare without an agent after the Trojans’ surprise run to the Round of 32 in this year’s NCAA Tournament. Like his teammates, Stewart can withdraw from the draft before May 24.
Stewart is not projected to be selected according to most experts’ mock drafts, making a return to USC likely. However, he turned heads during March Madness, pouring in 22 points against SMU and draining the game-winning shot. Six of Stewart’s baskets came from behind the arc, proving his duality across the court as a threat from outside and driving to the basket.
Stewart also added 12 points and four 3-pointers against Baylor, and he was the Trojans’ leading 3-point scorer throughout the 2016-17 campaign, sinking 78 threes. The total led the team by more than 30, with Boatwright and junior guard Jordan McLaughlin in second with 47 3-pointers each. Stewart was also one of the most efficient Trojan shooters from beyond the arc, trailing only McLaughlin in 3-point percentage.
The junior averaged 12.3 points and 3.9 rebounds per game last season while acting as a veteran presence on a team with just five upperclassmen. Stewart’s 175 career 3-pointers is sixth all-time in program history, just one bucket short of tying Harold Miner for fifth. A repeat of last season would catapult him to the top of the list; Lodrick Stewart is currently the all-time leader with 232 made threes from 2004 to 2007, a number that Stewart could catch up to if he continues to heat up from behind the arc.
With a new contract extension and a strong incoming recruiting class, head coach Andy Enfield would surely like to retain Stewart and build on the promising 2016-17 season. Although three Trojans have declared for the draft so far, none of these players have taken on an agent, meaning that they are still flexible in their decision making. Additionally, none of these three players are predicted to go even in the final round in expert mock drafts. 
This could change, however, with their performance at the NBA Combine, which will take place in Chicago from May 9 to 14. The combine gives athletes a chance to showcase their abilities in a series of drills, interviews and tests. The results of those five days will be one of the key deciding factors for Stewart and the rest of the players who have declared. 
From there, each of the Trojans will have to make a decision to stay or go by the deadline in May. If they decide to stay, they will return to summer ball with the Trojans and look to help Enfield return his team to the NCAA tourney for the third time in a row. If not, Stewart and his teammates will head to the NBA Draft, which will take place on June 22.
