On Monday night, film lovers, critics and creators alike came together at Seven Bar in downtown Los Angeles to celebrate the inaugural Los Angeles Chinese Film Festival. An exciting opportunity for independent filmmakers, this festival aims to integrate Chinese culture into the Los Angeles arts scene. 
The film festival has been in the works for approximately one year, and is set to culminate in the final event that will take place from Nov. 17 to 19. According to the LACFF website, the goal of the festival is “to uncover excellent Chinese language and Chinese culture focused films to foster cultural exchange through screenings and other activities.” In service of this mission, the programming committee has elicited original submissions from all over the world, especially from newcomers and independent filmmakers.
The film festival has several categories for submissions, including narrative, documentary, features/shorts and animation. For a film to be eligible for submission, the main language must be Chinese, a person of Chinese descent must be involved in production and the content must focus on Chinese society, culture or people. 
“We didn’t want to do something commercially driven or sponsored by the government,” co-founder Claire Yu said. “We didn’t want to make this event into any kind of political agenda. We wanted to showcase the best films. We want to provide a platform for all the filmmakers around the world.” 
Stella Xu, a graduate student studying communication management at USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, is a member of LACFF’s marketing team who recognizes the importance of the festival in fostering cross-cultural understanding.
“I really have met a lot of exciting people who are very talented and very passionate about creating independent Chinese films,” Xu said. “Many Chinese film festivals are censored or controlled by the companies, so they get money from them. It is not very [fair] to independent films, and they are overlooked. But there are some very talented producers and directors, and they don’t have many platforms. We also want to bridge the gap between American and Chinese culture.” 
The film festival has already received 416 submissions hailing from countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Italy and China. Some have been featured in the Cannes Film Festival, the Moscow International Film Festival and others. The panel of judges includes people from the film industry and various academic backgrounds, including USC professor of political science Stanley Rosen. It also includes producer Jonathan Sanger, UCLA professor of Asian languages and cultures Michael Berry and Hong Kong-based director and screenwriter Kenneth Ip. 
In addition to the screenings of the competition films, the festival will hold two additional film showcases: the screenings of the animation and experimental films — which will explore a different genre and highlight the innovation of these cutting edge filmmakers — and a short film documentary recommended by the D.C. Independent Film Festival. 
The festival will open with Paths of the Soul, a film that “captures the essence of LACFF,” according to programming director Baifan Xie.
“Los Angeles has one of the biggest Chinese populations in the United States and it is also the heart of the film and television entertainment industry,” LACFF founder Lewis Liu said. “But we felt that there was not enough connection between the two. We thought [we should] give Chinese filmmakers another stage and platform, where their films can be seen by filmmakers in Hollywood and get more exposure, which will help diversity in the industry.” 
Ultimately, the organizing committee hopes that the festival will come to serve as a “cradle for independent Chinese cinema,” according to LACFF’s website. Reservations for the festival, which will run from Nov. 17 to 19, must be made online. Screenings are priced according to film type, ranging from $15 to $30.

Before he was simply King Khan, I knew Arish Ahmad Khan as one half of The King Khan & BBQ Show. I fell in love with the duo’s sophomore album What’s For Dinner last semester when the track “Why Don’t You Lie” popped up on my Spotify Discover Weekly playlist. The duo’s sound was familiar yet distinct, as they blended doo-wop with punk sensibilities to create a simultaneously humorous and authentic album. Therefore, I was pleased to see a solo album by Khan appear on the new music section of Pitchfork last week. 
Released on Oct. 13, Murderburgers remains true to Khan’s commitment to classic garage rock (and food-themed titles), but it’s also a fresh and fabulous take on a retro formula. The cover art, too, maintains the same brilliant cartoonish absurdity of The King Khan & BBQ Show’s albums. It depicts Khan’s head and signature afro with wild eyes floating in between two neon signs (which seem to be a nod at beloved fast-food temple In-N-Out Burger) reading “King Khan’s Murderburgers.” 
The first three tracks on the album are all fairly comparable and follow the same thematic vein. “Discreate Disguise,” “It’s Just Begun,” and “Run Doggy Run,” are all deliciously mellow, nostalgic tracks that could work as the soundtrack of bluesy, neo-cowboy film. In “It’s Just Begun” especially, Khan’s vocals channel a Bob Dylan-esque whiny rasp with a country twang that would seem silly if it weren’t so well-executed. Indeed, these first three songs are a shrewd balance of parody and tribute to rock and roll acts of the 1960s that were so heavily influenced by country and blues. 
This is evident in the first few lines of “Run Doggy Run” as Khan croons, “You make love / You take love / You shake love / Till those tears roll out of your eyes,” — archetypally hippie lyrics. With the rhythm of the guitar licks and resonator in this track, you can almost envision Khan sauntering up on the back of a horse in the Wild West. There are even moments in this track where Khan adopts a vocal effect similar to the almost deadpan quality of Lou Reed’s voice. But the song is far from stagnant and Khan breaks it down in the end with a ripping guitar solo as he softly screams à la Paul McCartney in the background, “Run along lil’ doggy.”

This transitions elegantly into the next songs, “It’s A Lie” and “Born in 77,” which feature fewer country references and are instead more decidedly classic rock-oriented, in a way offering listeners a lesson in music history. “Born in 77,” in particular, with wild piano riffs and guitar chord progressions, is a fairly faithful rip of “Gimme Shelter” by the Rolling Stones, making it perhaps less compelling than some of the other tracks. 
The flow from track to track is not always smooth and predictable, however, as the tempo of the album undulates, constantly keeping listeners on their toes. For instance, Khan moves from the low-key, groovy, song “Too Hard Too Fast,” with vocal harmonies and organ reminiscent of ’60s rock ’n’ roll groups like The Doors, to fast and heavy tracks like “Teeth Are Shite,” which resembles the angsty, screamy pop punk of the ’90s. However, the record’s bipolar nature works by displaying Khan’s versatility as he masters an impressive breadth of genres, moods and sounds. 
Even more striking is Khan’s ability to assemble all of these tracks to create an album that is cohesive and logical. While his songs may vary in cadence, Khan’s general attitude of playfulness is omnipresent and overarching. Despite a few missteps, as his tributes can occasionally bleed into robbery, Khan is mostly able to preserve his own voice, while still exploring various aspects and time periods of rock ’n’ roll. Murderburgers is an extraordinarily apt title for the LP, as “murder” evokes both the motifs of drama and machismo prevalent in country and early rock music, and “burgers” are a quintessential American food. These two concepts drive at the heart of the work, which aims to be a goofy twist on classic American roots music.

Violinist Etienne Gara, pianist Patrice Rushen, percussionist Ian Wurfl and bassist Edwin Livingston perform. Photo by Kaitlyn Chu | Daily Trojan
An examination of the mind’s capacity for creativity and the world of music converged at Tuesday’s “Sketches of Miles: The Workshop” performance at the USC Brain and Creativity Institute. Hosted by the Thornton School of Music, the event was commissioned by the Institute and featured works from Bach to Miles Davis in an exploration of how two seemingly disparate genres of classical and jazz can come together to create something new and captivating. After the performance, the musicians — comprising violinist Etienne Gara, pianist Patrice Rushen, percussionist Ian Wurfl and bass player Edwin Livingston — had a conversation with the Thornton dean Robert Cutietta and the BCI director Antonio Damasio. 
Classical pieces were combined with Miles Davis songs, or took inspiration from Davis’ style and process. There was also improvisation used at certain points. The ensemble performed three pieces before the panel discussion, then also surprised the audience after the discussion with a tribute to one of Davis’ arrangers that combined Debussy’s “The Girl with the Flaxen Hair” and George Gershwin’s “Summertime.”
Davis is a representative of the institute itself, as one of his paintings that he produced near the end of his life hangs in the lobby of the institute. Damasio explained how he wanted Gara to put together a program that brought together the classical and jazz styles, while still keeping Davis in mind. 
The moderators were particularly interested in the the challenges of mixing the two different styles of music. Gara emphasized that while the styles may be different and musicians may react to music differently, all genres share a common theme of humanity. 
“There’s no questions about what are the difficulties,” Gara said. “The only answer is how will I answer what you’re trying to tell me, and how will I pass the message that I want you so badly to understand.” 
Imagery was also particularly important to their creative processes. Wurfl discussed all the preparation that went into the arranging of the pieces, before the musicians could even begin to think about how they played with one another. 
“We printed out the score, and Etienne would describe every section of the song,” Wurfl said. “Like, ‘Here I want this to be like the sun is rising in the jungle in the morning’. Or ‘This piece is like Christmas time in Moscow but it’s like Tim Burton.’ So, that is how we started putting the music on the page, with images.”
As the panelists opened the discussion, a few audiences members chimed in during the discussion to reflect on their listening experiences. One described the difference of the two concerts that were going on simultaneously — the visual and auditory — and that she experienced the music much differently when she closed her eyes. Another felt that music was telling a story, as there were lilting elements in the compositions. 
Thomas Mellan, a first-year graduate student majoring in pipe organ and composition, was impressed by the performers’ ability to combine the two genres, as he’d never heard something like it before. 
“The assimilation is interesting,” Mellan said. “Here, their originality comes from combination.”
When asked what he hoped people would take away from this performance, Gara provided some advice for people with creative aspirations. 
“There is no bad kind of failure, as long as you’re not deadly hurt,” Gara said. “There’s always something to learn from it. You should not know what is ahead. If it’s scary, you’re heading the right way.”
Overall, the workshop performance, “Sketches of Miles” served to reveal the power of togetherness, regardless of genre or musical background, in overcoming challenges and creating beauty. As Rushen put it, “The arts and creativity are what makes us human.”

Redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Christian Rector departed practice on Wednesday with a hand injury. Photo by Matt Karatsu | Daily Trojan
The football team took to the practice field on Wednesday for the second time since a disappointing 49-14 loss to Notre Dame last week. The Trojans can still win the Pac-12 South, but will have to perform better going forward, starting with this week’s road matchup with Arizona State.
Preparing for the Sun Devils
Helton said that Wednesday’s practice focused on the team’s third-down game plan, specifically keying in on Arizona State wide receiver N’Keal Harry, who leads the team with 51 receptions for 627 yards and three touchdowns this season.
The focus extended to the other side of the ball, too. 
“Coach Bennett on third down is doing a really nice job everywhere, from cover-zero pressures to drop-eight,” Helton said of ASU’s defensive coordinator Phil Bennett. “He’s mixed it up really well, especially over the last two weeks, and they’ve created a lot of havoc.” 
The Sun Devils have come into their own over the last two weeks. After allowing an average of 36.4 points through their first five games, they have given up just 17 points total against No. 12 Washington and Utah. Arizona State held the Utes to 110 rushing yards and forced Utah quarterback Tyler Huntley to throw four interceptions last week. The Sun Devils look to repeat the feat against a Trojan offense that has struggled with turnovers all season.
On offense, Arizona State is led by the running back tandem of Kalen Ballage and Demario Richard, who have combined for 687 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns this season, including 168 yards and a score last week.
“Both backs run hard, [and] they’re both big,” junior linebacker Cam Smith said. “Their running game works well for them.”
Injuries
Redshirt sophomore defensive lineman Christian Rector left Wednesday’s practice with a hand injury. Head coach Clay Helton wouldn’t say if it was serious, but did admit he was concerned.
“Whenever you have to leave the field it’s not good,” Helton said. 
If Rector is unavailable on Saturday, sophomore linebackers Jordan Iosefa, Connor Murphy and Oluwole Betiku Jr. could take turns in his spot.
Helton also said he hopes to have redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. back tomorrow.
“He felt a lot better today,” Helton said of Mitchell, who has been dealing with a shoulder injury. “We’ll see where it’s at tomorrow. I am planning on him making the trip.” 
Helton also said the team was preparing sophomore Michael Pittman Jr. to fill in for Mitchell if needed.
Freshman long snapper Damon Johnson is out of concussion protocol and has returned to practice. Helton said Johnson was fully cleared for this week’s game. In addition, junior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga did not practice Wednesday as he dealt with an illness.
Finally, freshman tight end Josh Falo was held out with a foot injury. He will be evaluated over the coming days. After logging limited practice time yesterday, junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin was not wearing pads on Wednesday.
“Being able to put full weight on [his injured toe] and run is the first step,” Helton said. “Hopefully we’ll get some change of direction over the coming days and see where he’s at by the end of the week.”

Senior driver Matteo Morelli and the Trojans are entering the stretch run of the season as the top-ranked team in the nation. Photo by Tucker Judkins | Daily Trojan
After securing a commanding 13-8 win over UC Irvine on Saturday, the men’s water polo team will travel to Irvine, Calif., to take on Concordia on Friday before facing San Jose State at home Saturday for senior day. 
The Trojans, ranked No. 1 in the nation with a 19-1 record, plan to use Friday and Saturday’s matchups as practice heading into their final regular-season stretch against No. 3 Cal, No. 5 Pacific and No. 2 UCLA. 
Neither of USC’s opponents this weekend is particularly formidable: Concordia sits at 9-8 on the season, and San Jose State already lost to the Trojans 18-9 at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center last month. But as USC looks to use this weekend as a springboard into the stretch run, the team is determined to retain full focus. 
“Obviously, we’re a better team than [Concordia and San Jose State], but usually when you play those kind of games, the focus is not really up high,” senior driver Matteo Morelli said. “So we’ve got to focus on jumping into the water as if we’re playing the NCAA final, as if we’re playing Cal, UCLA or Stanford.”
But the Trojans aren’t facing those elite sides just yet. Concordia is coming off a 10-7 win over Air Force last Sunday, but the Eagles suffered a 20-2 drubbing at the hands of UC Davis the week before. San Jose State, on the other hand, has won four matches on the trot and sports a 13-8 overall record — but the Spartans are also winless on the road this season (0-5).
Morelli said the Trojans have been focusing on playing the cleanest game possible. Neither Concordia nor San Jose State is ranked, giving USC an opportunity to perfect its game.
“We’re going to get a lot of fast break opportunities,” Morelli said. “We’ve got to focus on not missing a high percentage of shots [or] opportunities and try to not give up any goals.”
Senior utility James Walters, a captain, said that rather than focus on specific improvements, the team has been working on improving its overall game in practices. 
“We’re watching video, we’re working on it and we’re seeing little things we can fix here and there,” Walters said. “At the end of the day, we’re just going to work hard in order to get to those games where we can prove ourselves.”
While Walters said the upcoming games against Cal, Pacific and UCLA take priority, the team is also looking forward to Saturday’s senior day festivities before the game against San Jose State, which will honor the team’s 13 seniors.
“Growing up here the past couple of years, we’ve gotten to see all the seniors [go through senior day] — it’s always a happy time for them with their parents,” Walters said. “So I’m looking forward to it. I think it should be fun.”
USC’s tilt at Concordia begins at 1:30 p.m. on Friday, and the Trojans will return to the Uytengsu Aquatics Center to take on San Jose State at 1 p.m. on Saturday.

Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier and the Women of Troy will travel north to face Washington and Washington State. Photo by George Lydakis | Daily Trojan
The No. 19 USC women’s volleyball team (15-6, 7-3 Pac-12) will travel to the Pacific Northwest to kick off the back half of its Pac-12 schedule. Head coach Mick Haley’s squad will face No. 14 Washington (16-5, 6-4 Pac-12) and Washington State (13-9, 2-8 Pac-12) this weekend. 
It’s the third consecutive week the Women of Troy have held the No. 19 spot in the AVCA poll.
“When you play on the road in the [Pac-12], it’s very difficult to get wins,” Haley said. “So we need to steal some wins on somebody else’s court.”
The Pac-12 is one of the toughest conferences in the nation for women’s volleyball, with half of its teams currently ranked in the top 25. The Women of Troy own a 6-3 record on the road, two of the losses coming from conference games. USC is 6-1 at home on the season. 
On the team’s road matches this past weekend, USC was swept by Colorado but came back with a five-set decision against Utah despite missing offensive powerhouse sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier.
In Lanier’s absence, senior opposite hitters Brittany Abercrombie and Niki Withers spearheaded the Trojan offense. Together, they combined for a total of 56 kills through the weekend, each putting up 28 kills. Junior outside hitter Alyse Ford also chipped in nine kills in the win against the Utes.
Last time the Huskies and Trojans met, USC pulled off an upset with a straight sweep (25-20, 25-21, 28-26) over then-sixth ranked Washington at the Galen Center. On the road, the Women of Troy have not fared as well against the Huskies. They are 1-9 in their last 10 visits to Seattle; however, USC holds the advantage over Washington State in Pullman, boasting a 7-3 record in the same span. 
To prepare for the difficulty of road matches, Haley is focused on getting his team comfortable and focused. Stealing road wins for the Women of Troy will be vital if they want to remain within the top three of the conference. Right now, they find themselves a spot above the Huskies, so a win against them on Friday would be key.
To beat Washington, the Women of Troy will have to limit senior outside hitter Carly DeHoog. She is Washington’s offensive go-to with 227 kills on the season, averaging 2.95 kills a set. Last time she faced USC, she put up 15 kills. The key to the Trojans’ victory was holding everyone else in the Huskies’ offense to seven or fewer kills. 
With a day break after their match in Seattle, the Women of Troy will square off against the Cougars. USC will face another high-powered pin attacker in Taylor Mims. The junior outside hitter has 321 kills on the season, averaging 3.87 kills per set. To say Washington State leans on her would be an understatement. Mims has 158 more kills this season than McKenna Woodford, another junior outside hitter. To put her numbers in perspective, Lanier has 290 kills on the season, just 34 more kills than Abercrombie. 
But before setting a gameplan for the Washington schools, Haley said the Women of Troy have been focused on themselves and working with new players in their lineup.
“We’re really spending a lot of time on ourselves, quite honestly — we’ve got to basically be comfortable with being uncomfortable,” Haley said. “We’ve got some new people that we’ve got to get in a comfortable situation. We’re just trying to get a little bit better in every position.”
A nice article, and good to see Jodee writing again. Haven’t seen much from her lately.

Julia Poe | Daily Trojan
I’ll be honest, it’s hard for me to be quiet anymore when I watch, read about or think about the USC football team.
Most of the time, even the mere mention of the team elicits a curse or a groan from my direction. I’ve reached that point of any overhyped, underperformed season where I’m beyond disappointed — just exhausted by the grueling nature of the week-to-week drama and the effort it takes to cheer even half-heartedly for a team when you know its season is already over.
It’s hard to be too angry at any of the individual players who have struggled this season. There’s been plenty of injuries to go around, and between the beat-up starting lineup and the youth of the players remaining, it’s always difficult to be too hard on young players who just can’t seem to figure it out.
But in the past few weeks, I’ve felt a building resentment toward one part of this Trojan unit: the coaching staff. Head coach Clay Helton remains the indomitably good-natured nice guy of USC, but his responses after stumbling performances and crushing losses have become increasingly weak and vague as the weeks persist.
This problem is even worse, however, in the assistant coaches. Offensive coordinator Tee Martin has been almost infamous in his inability to acknowledge key weaknesses in his offense and insisting that his team is improving from week to week.
But offensive line coach Neil Callaway officially took the cake this week when Los Angeles Times reporter Zach Helfand interviewed him after practice. Crippled by injuries, the offensive line took a brutal beatdown in South Bend last weekend, getting pancaked on almost every play by a smothering Notre Dame defensive line.
Despite this, Callaway acted as if the line performed well. Helfand recorded the following series of defensive non-answers:
Two reporters approached Callaway after Tuesday’s practice to inquire why USC’s offensive line didn’t produce consistently against Notre Dame.
“Who said we didn’t?” Callaway said.
There were linemen who got beaten up front.
“And that’s your opinion, right?” Callaway said.
It’s on the game tape.
“You answered the question,” Callaway said. “You answer it. You answer it then.”
So do you think the line has been playing well?
“I didn’t say that,” Callaway said.
Helton said they lost the physical battle. Why do you think that hasn’t been the case?
“All right, let’s call this thing off,” he said, patting the reporters on the shoulders and walking off the field.
“All right. We’ll see y’all.”
Don’t even try to argue with me — this is unacceptable. If coaches should do anything, they should take responsibility for their team. They mold these young men’s talents and shape them through practices and offensive schemes and in-game advice. Coaches are the ones in charge, from the start of spring ball to the end of the postseason. And it’s time for USC’s coaches to take accountability for their jobs.
What’s worse is that the players — most of whom are under 21 years old — are the ones setting an example for their coaches. After Saturday’s blowout loss to Notre Dame, the players ambled slowly and dejectedly out of the locker room, picking up bags of Chik-fil-A and shuffling past a barricade to greet scattered family before heading to the bus. 
Most had to be steered toward the small crowd of reporters anxiously waiting for answers about the primetime meltdown that took place on the field only minutes before. Even redshirt senior safety and team captain Chris Hawkins, who typically greets the media with ease and honesty, hung his head and avoided eyes as he attempted to slip past.
But not redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold. When he saw the press pool, he immediately walked over, brushed his hair back and nodded to signal that he was ready. There was an awkward pause, and then we all dove in: What happened with the fumble, with the interception, with the deep pitch to redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell that just didn’t connect? Was it the offensive line? The receivers? The atmosphere?
Most of Darnold’s answers, like any interview with an athlete, were laden with cliches and vagueties. But the one thing that Darnold didn’t do was make excuses.
He blamed himself for the opening fumble, regardless of the fact that redshirt senior center Nico Falah zipped the snap at his facemask rather than his hands. He pointed to parts of his play that could be improved, gave credit to Notre Dame’s swarming defense and refused to allow himself to brush off the loss. 
It was easy to get annoyed by Darnold’s responses, because most of what he was saying was a general reiteration of, “We have to be better,” packaged with a different variety of sports-isms. As reporters, we wanted answers, something concrete to write about. But Darnold still did more than his coaches. He took the blame. He didn’t back down from his mistakes. And he promised that he would at least try to do better.
Martin and Callaway and the rest of the coaching staff should take a page out of Darnold’s book. Being a leader is about taking the blame and being honest. If the USC coaching staff isn’t prepared to admit when it makes mistakes or faces hardship, then it isn’t ready to win championships — or ball games for that matter.
We know it’s been a rough season. So do they. So instead of making excuses or ignoring the issues, make a change. It’s time to cut the crap. That’s the only way this team is going to start to get better.

Hey Hecuba,
When is it appropriate to ghost somebody? Ghosting, in case you don’t know what it is, is the act of suddenly disappearing from somebody’s life, usually in romantic contexts. 
Thanks,
Disappearing in Doheny
Hi Disappearing,
While ghosting is never the most mature way to handle a situation, it’s understandable that this method is growing in popularity. Most things in life require action to achieve the desired result; ghosting simply requires inaction to achieve it. 
I’ve been happily married for more than a few centuries now, but I can empathize with those who have been ghosted. When my husband was away at war, every day that he was gone was agonizing because I never knew if he’d return or if he’d been killed in battle. I was in a limbo, similar to people who are ghosted. They don’t know whether you’re not interested at all or just really busy and planning to get back to them later, all because you’re avoiding having an awkward or uncomfortable conversation. 
There are repercussions to ghosting, too. The other person will likely take much longer to move on because they don’t have any finality to the situation and may even feel worse about your relationship than if you had just ended things in a more transparent way. Want to ask out a friend of theirs in the future? Don’t count on things working out; they’ve probably heard about your propensity to ghost already.
That said, here are a few instances that I think it would be appropriate or reasonable to ghost: 
And that’s all. It’s a short list! 
In summary, most people deserve a text at the very least. The amount of time you’ve been seeing them is generally proportional to the length of explanation you owe them. Plus, you’ll be stronger for it, and if they ever become your boss unexpectedly, it won’t be super uncomfortable.
Have a spoopy Halloween and ghost carefully,
Hecuba

(From left to right): USG Senators Noah Silver, Preston Fregia and Katie Bolton proposed removing USC’s diesel buses in an effort to reach zero emissions. Photo by Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Undergraduate Student Government senators Noah Silver, Preston Fregia and Katie Bolton proposed the Zero Emissions Bus Fleet Resolution Tuesday night to shift USC bus leases away from diesel-fueled buses. 
“Los Angeles is one of worst cities in the United States in terms of air quality, and we want to play a part in improving this situation,” Silver said.
The senators’ motion to remove diesel buses comes almost seven years after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or Metro, retired its final diesel-powered buses from service.
Silver said he believes that USC must take action to advance alongside this trend. According to National Geographic, Los Angeles ranks as the worst city in terms of ozone pollution in the last 13 years.
USC Transportation had originally proposed implementing electric buses for USC’s 2020 sustainability plan, but the proposal was rejected due to cost concerns, according to Silver. 
“The University is concerned with the cost, but this resolution is progress and progress is always expensive,” Silver said.
Bolton spoke about the long-term benefits of the proposal, saying that it will be cost-effective after sufficient time.
“It is worthwhile because it pays dividends forever,” Bolton said. “Cleaner air, reduced carbon footprint and decreased fuel costs justify it as a long-term investment.” 
According to Silver, USC would potentially be able to transition from diesel-fueled buses to zero-emissions buses without extreme costs because the buses are leased, and instead of purchasing new buses, the University could end the lease with the current bus provider. 
Bolton explained that the proposal includes a clause that grants  USG authority to monitor the progress of its implementation in future years.
“It would be easy for the administration to set this aside in future years and forget about it when current USG members graduate,” Bolton said. “We added a clause that says that the University will report back yearly on the progress of its implementation.”
The resolution will be voted on at next Tuesday’s USG meeting.
“If USC wants to be seen as a leader in sustainability, this is an important step in right direction,” Silver said.

The USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and HBO have partnered to create a yearlong speaker series titled the Diverse Voices Forums, which will begin on Wednesday. 
According to USC Annenberg Dean Willow Bay in a press release, the partnership developed from a question and answer session Bay moderated with HBO’s CEO Richard Plepler this spring.
The series was created to discuss diversity in future entertainment in the classroom and in interactive community forums with various professionals providing new perspectives. 
Its events will be open to all USC students, and it aims to connect Annenberg students and faculty with HBO professionals. Producer David Simon, who worked on HBO shows “The Wire” and “The Deuce,” will be in conversation with Taj Frazier, director of the Institute of Diversity and Empowerment at Annenberg on Wednesday. Simon will also attend Frazier’s undergraduate course “Race and Ethnicity in Entertainment and the Arts” to engage in classroom discussion.
Annenberg will also host other HBO professionals to discuss issues such as race, gender, sexual orientation, age and ability as portrayed in its shows throughout the 2017-18 academic year. These industry professionals have worked on shows like Insecure, Ballers, Silicon Valley and Westworld.
“We are thrilled to form and strengthen partnerships with industry leaders such as HBO to position USC Annenberg along communication’s new frontier,” Bay said in the press release. “Our faculty are thought leaders on topics of race, gender and representation in media and will dive deep to look at HBO’s role in amplifying voices of difference.”

Astronaut and photographer Terry Virts visited a School of Cinematic Arts class focused on IMAX movie production Tuesday night to speak about his involvement in “A Beautiful Planet.” Photo by Yang Li | Daily Trojan
Cinematic Arts students filled up the seats in the Michelle and Kevin Douglas IMAX Theatre on Tuesday to listen to astronaut and photographer Terry Virts speak of his experiences as a cameraman for the IMAX film, A Beautiful Planet. 
Virts spoke to a class focused on IMAX production about how shots of the movie were taken at the Cupola, a seven-windowed observation room located on the side of the space station, so astronauts could get a panoramic view of Earth from 250 miles away.  
“Working with IMAX was probably my favorite because we were able to share the story of space flight to many people,” Virts said. 
Virts took over 300,000 still photographs throughout this mission and had many of his captures turned into timelapses for the final production of the film.  
After the film was released, A Beautiful Planet won Heartland Film’s 2016 Truly Moving Picture Award and was nominated for Motion Picture Sound Editors 2017 Golden Reel Award. 
Along with the images of the planet, the movie featured astronauts Virts, Anton Shkaplerov, Kjell Lindgren, Scott Kelly and Samantha Cristoforetti and the aspects of their daily lives in space, from showering to celebrating the holidays. 
“I have a deep interest in space travel and exploration, as well as in photography,” said Neil Banerjee, a senior majoring in cinematic arts and computational neuroscience. “Astronauts in general, both American and otherwise, are carrying out amazing and dangerous expeditions on behalf of humankind, so any chance to meet one in person is an easy ‘yes’ from me.” 
With clips of scenes and stills playing in the background, Virts spoke about the film processes utilized, the difficulties he faced in the foreign environment and his favorite scenes that he shot. 
“I never really thought about this, but sound is so important for a movie,” Virts said. “Have you ever watched a movie without sound or with sound only? Sound is what makes the movie. So I went around space with a camera and filmed the sound of the environment. I filmed the noises of the fan, the metals from the exercise machines, the crackly ghost sound of the radio … I wanted the audience to hear the unique sound of space.”
Some of the challenges the team faced while shooting included amplifying the natural sound and having the perfect lighting for certain scenes. According to Virts, he had to use a metal tether that was attached to his space suit to transmit sound due to the lack of air in space,. He also explained how in space, lighting was always extreme because the shots were always too bright or too dark. Therefore, he ended up fixing this problem by utilizing the screen lighting from laptops. 
He also discussed how, although he took many candid shots to show the reality of space, Virts tried to stage some scenes to emphasize the 3-D effects of the film. For example, Virts filmed himself washing his hair so the audience could see the floating water droplets coming toward them in 3-D.
Virts said that many of the shots and scenes were done with Ghost cameras, Panasonic 3-D cameras, Nikon D4s, Canon XF305s and Red Dragon video recording cameras. Along with the pictures of the devices, Canon provided replicas of the same cameras that were used on the ISS. These replicas were presented to the students, while Virts pointed out some of the features that he used while shooting, such as the shutter speed and aperture.
“Listening to Terry opened up the possibility of exploring filmmaking in different and more extreme environments,” USC alumnus Fei Yu said. “Just having the knowledge of the techniques used in these new places like space will help my career path. The nature of his situation has really inspired me to look beyond the norm of filmmaking.”

American culture’s contemporary emphasis on diversity is well-placed, and the institutionalization of diversity through various programs at universities made sense when they were put in place. But things change, and it’s hard to envisage what comes next.
It goes unspoken that diversity is an integral component of the human experience. And yet, militant activism pushing for more diverse numbers at institutions has been on the rise.
Anyone who takes perhaps a 10-mile journey anywhere in the world will see the internal diversity of any society unfold before their eyes — diversity of living situations and built environments, of political economies, of social classes, of religious and cultural customs and often of ethnicities. A quick drive from the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and Figueroa Street up to, say, downtown Los Angeles’ Union Station, is our local (and a particularly vivid) example of this modern fact.
So if humanity is diverse by nature, then surely the cultural, ritualized celebration of diversity by modern Western society is a good thing. And so must be modern Western society’s institutionalization and advancement of diversity through loose quotas, identity group representation and media, and the reshaping of narratives to reflect human diversity. Right?
On the outset, yes. If a society’s culture and institutions are not reflective of and responsive to the basic facts and truths of the human experience, as experienced by its members, they’ll be an odd fit. Diversity of identities tends to be one of those truths, wherever you go. Given that pretty much every society (but postwar coastal America, especially) is somewhat culturally and intellectually diverse, and that many are somewhat religiously and ethnically diverse, it makes sense that in many societies — especially ours — people have dignity and representation afforded to different groups, with “unitary” institutions mostly being based on whatever compromises and common interests those groups could come to when such institutions were created.
There’s a consequence to this, one that is neither good nor bad intrinsically. The institutionalization of particular values and compromises and matrices of dignity reflect the times in which they were created, and the identities of the particular groups involved as those identities were conceived at the time.
But some apparent facts complicate this. Identities of various kinds of groups evolve over time, with technological, demographic, cultural and economic trends constantly shifting: Individuals are never simply part of one group, but are always members of at least two or three if not a half-dozen or more, and can even transition between groups over time.
The fact that people can alternate and slide between different groups, and that groups themselves are constantly changing, renders a problem for the institutionalization of values. How can institutions and cultural values particular to certain historical moments or experiences be relevant further down the road, when situations have changed and individuals have diverged? The left-leaning refrain about the American Founding being irrelevant for having been conducted by “dead white men” is at least partly valid; Thomas Jefferson himself suggested that “every constitution … and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years.”
To bring it all back to the modern American university campus, that citadel of the cosmopolitan civilization encompassing the coastal urban metropoles of the globe, consider for a moment that our current university system’s institutions and customs are all merely a few decades old. American culture’s contemporary emphasis on diversity is well-placed, and the institutionalization of diversity through various programs at universities made sense when they were put in place. But things change, and it’s hard to envisage what comes next.
It goes unspoken that diversity is an integral component of the human experience. And yet, militant activism pushing for more diverse numbers at institutions has been on the rise.
Anyone who takes perhaps a 10-mile journey anywhere in the world will see the internal diversity of any society unfold before their eyes — diversity of living situations and built environments, of political economies, of social classes, of religious and cultural customs and often of ethnicities.

And so must be modern Western society’s institutionalization and advancement of diversity through loose quotas, identity group representation and media, and the reshaping of narratives to reflect human diversity. Right?
On the outset, yes. If a society’s culture and institutions are not reflective of and responsive to the basic facts and truths of the human experience, as experienced by its members, they’ll be an odd fit. Diversity of identities tends to be one of those truths, wherever you go. Given that pretty much every society (but postwar coastal America, especially) is somewhat culturally and intellectually diverse, and that many are somewhat religiously and ethnically diverse, it makes sense that in many societies — especially ours — people have dignity and representation afforded to different groups, with “unitary” institutions mostly being based on whatever compromises and common interests those groups could come to when such institutions were created.
There’s a consequence to this, one that is neither good nor bad intrinsically. The institutionalization of particular values and compromises and matrices of dignity reflect the times in which they were created, and the identities of the particular groups involved as those identities were conceived at the time.
But some apparent facts complicate this. Identities of various kinds of groups evolve over time, with technological, demographic, cultural and economic trends constantly shifting: Individuals are never simply part of one group, but are always members of at least two or three if not a half-dozen or more, and can even transition between groups over time.
The fact that people can alternate and slide between different groups, and that groups themselves are constantly changing, renders a problem for the institutionalization of values. How can institutions and cultural values particular to certain historical moments or experiences be relevant further down the road, when situations have changed and individuals have diverged? The left-leaning refrain about the American Founding being irrelevant for having been conducted by “dead white men” is at least partly valid; Thomas Jefferson himself suggested that “every constitution … and every law, naturally expires at the end of 19 years.”
To bring it all back to the modern American university campus, that citadel of the cosmopolitan civilization encompassing the coastal urban metropoles of the globe, consider for a moment that our current university system’s institutions and customs are all merely a few decades old. Broad-based access to higher education via the GI Bill, Pell Grants and student loans came at the tail end of the New Deal. Specific recruitment of ethnically diverse student populations is a legacy of the Civil Rights Movement and the intellectual movements of the 1960s and ’70s. Modern universities’ enshrinement of cultural diversity in particular, and their less explicit enshrinement of socioeconomic diversity through commitment to financial aid and opportunity, is in some ways a legacy of the mid-20th century when these institutions were recrafted to better serve and reflect a mass middle-class democracy of increasingly diverse sub currents.
But it’s been a bit longer than 19 years since 1944 or 1965. Domestically, inequality has grown since the 1980s. Cultural and ethnic trends — like the increasing share of the American collegiate population claiming ancestry from two or more races, or the rise of secular values — are complicating the older version of the diversity narrative.
At a cultural level, it seems like the universities are adapting, but at an institutional level, it remains a question whether hard policy questions of quotas, identity group representation, official narratives and similar adaptations will follow smoothly, or with fits and starts.
In any case, the continued diversity of the human experience — in all its forms — is fascinating to observe and experience.

Get rid of Title IX parasites! They are feminazi vermin.
It’s time for the pendulum to swing in the opposite direction – America needs unity, clarity and direction far more than diversity, chaos and cacophony.

Ritualized, formalized diversity is necessary. Elite universities are no longer for the privileged, or so the trend might suggest. The Washington Post reported Monday that Princeton University has tripled its Pell share receiving populace to 22 percent. Broadly, almost everyone agrees that diversity is beneficial for higher education. Yet, some believe that the means to accomplish this has resulted in a formalistic institutionalization of diversity which has done students a disservice. However, it’s precisely this ritualization that makes steps toward diversity meaningful. 
It’s true that when we institutionalize diversity, we simplify what diversity means. We ask students to put themselves in socioeconomic and ethnocultural boxes; if they come from disadvantaged backgrounds, we force them to commodify their experiences. And yes, there’s something gross about the admissions committee at an elite educational institution, with its billion-dollar endowment, that looks upon personal statements from students who faced serious challenges with a morbid fascination. For underrepresented students, whose life experiences consist of far more than the challenges they faced as a result of their blackness, brownness or low-income backgrounds, the practice can feel particularly reductionist.
Rose Courteau, a mentor for Minds Matter, a nonprofit college preparation provider, touches on this sentiment in her essay for The Atlantic entitled, “The Problem With How Higher Education Treats Diversity.” 
“I don’t want my students to reduce their own lives to stories of hardship — or, at least, I don’t want them to feel that they need to in order to earn a berth at the college they choose,” Coureau wrote. “Still, the pressure for students — particularly underrepresented nonwhite and low-income applicants — to package themselves like this is acute at a time when ‘diversity’ remains the only rationale for affirmative action that the Supreme Court has consistently upheld.”
Contreau alludes to an important point. The commodification of diversity isn’t a result of educational institutions’ desire for diversity. It’s because educational institutions have decided that they want diversity because they think it improves the educational experience for everyone.
“All of our lives are enriched not by surrounding ourselves with like-minded people, so much as they are by including those who are different,” Provost Michael Quick said to USC News in May 2016. “That diversity of experience creates a rich contrast in perspectives that gives us all a chance to challenge our status quo.”

Quick isn’t wrong, but he’s ignoring another, crucial purpose of diversity in higher education: It uplifts historically marginalized communities. It is a specific economic equalizer and enabler of social mobility. If we could accept that diversity in higher education would be important even if it did not enrich the educational atmosphere, maybe we wouldn’t have to pressure students into exploiting their backgrounds.
Yet, the solution is not to de-ritualize diversity, or to reduce our institutional attention toward it. It’s because the historical barriers that black, brown and low-income students face are both systemic and structural. Black and brown students face the school-to-prison pipeline — policies implemented by educational institutions in communities of color that funnel students into the criminal justice system — built by decades of prejudiced policy. The war on drugs results in the threat of unnecessary incarceration for low-level drug offenses. At the most basic level, young people of color from communities in which violence is common — somewhere they might have been pushed to due to racist redlining policies — might fear for their safety. And yet, the decades of police brutality and racial profiling entrenched in stop-and-frisk might give them reason to pause to seek government protection.
The barriers that low-income students and students of color face before they even get to higher education are endless, and inextricably entangled with historical and structural disadvantage that has been codified in law and policy.
Thus, the reason that the lack of diversity in higher education requires a systemic solution is because it is a systemic problem.
The institutionalization of diversity isn’t the problem here, but it is gnarly and complicated. The best course of action isn’t to abandon it completely; it’s to continue to listen to the affected communities, engage in thoughtful reflection and accept that the steps we take forward could have adverse consequences. Then, it’s to make our system better.

This Thursday through Sunday, the USC School of Dramatic Arts is shaking up campus with its rendition of Trojan Barbie. 
A contemporary take on Euripides’ The Trojan Women, Trojan Barbie centers on the perils a heroine faces, with the past and present colliding during her tour of modern-day Troy. Directed by Juilliard alumnus Ken Sawyer, the play based on Christine Evans’ book places the audience in a thought-provoking position to experience recent events associated with war and its aftermath.
The play follows Lotte, an English doll restorer, who is taken during her vacation and detained in a mental asylum comparable to that of the ancient camps that housed the Trojan Women. The combination of both contemporary and ancient elements creates an environment where topics such as the cessation of military hostilities, the effects of institutionalization on women and the mass deaths of men in combat became relevant to modern society and the consequences of war throughout history. As for today, when detainment and treatment of people during war periods, specifically females, is rarely spoken about, Trojan Barbie serves as a gateway for the discussion of the complex repercussions faced post-conflict.
“[The play] comments on our patriarchal society from the perspective of women patients in a mental asylum, juxtaposing their situation with that of the Trojan refugee women of the Trojan War of Greek mythology,” said Harley Douvier, a senior majoring in theatre, who plays the roles of Clive, Officer in the Blue and Menelaus in Trojan Barbie.
The production captures the audience in a time period that is both overstated and hidden at the same time. The unreliability of what time period all of the characters are in pushes the viewers to question the importance of time itself. All of the themes within the play are enduring, regardless of when they occurred. This inconsistency can be placed on the characters as well, leaving it up to the discretion of the viewer as to whether the story is focused on the struggles of Lotte or of Hecuba, the wife of King Priam during the Trojan War. 
“This play is an interaction between the psychological, the physiological and the psychedelic worlds,” Douvier said. “The play is constantly shifting between dreamstate and reality, allotting our audience just the right amount of visual spectacle to let their imaginations take off.”
This production consists of 17 students playing one role each, with the exception of Douvier, who will be playing three characters. As with many other plays showcased by the School of Dramatic Arts, SDA students actively contribute to the behind-the-scenes makings of their numerous student-run productions. The intricacies and complexities of Trojan Barbie place the audience in a blurry time period and allow for SDA students to experience the process of creating this state.
“I hope the audience draws parallels between the issues in the play and those that we are facing with our society and current political state, gaining an empathetic view of the repercussions of war, racism, xenophobia and gender inequality,” Douvier said. “Come with an open mind, ready to explore an emotionally engaging step away from reality.”

“Sport has a way to change people,” panelist Renata Simril said.
“The Nation Skate: Diplomacy, Diversity, and Global Engagement through Skateboarding,” a panel event hosted by USC Visions and Voices, was held on Monday evening at Wallis Annenberg Hall. It hosted notable speakers involved in skate culture and sports diplomacy to encourage conversations about how to change the world through skateboarding. 
The evening began with Willow Bay, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, introducing the panel moderators: Neftalie Williams, an adjunct professor at Annenberg who lectures on the intersection of skateboarding, business, media and culture in the United States; and K.C. Cole, a journalism professor at Annenberg who specializes in science and society. Williams and Cole then kicked off the first part of the event, “Creating a Global Community: Business, the Academy, and Philanthropy in Action Sports,” by introducing the four starting panelists: Johnny Schillereff, Trina Bolton, Renata Simril and Garth Ross.
The discussion focused on the development of skate culture, and each panelist focused on how these elements play out in society. Schillereff, the founder of skate brand Element, commented on the equalizing power of skateboarding. 
“Skateboarding was born from the streets, and there’s no denying that,” Schillereff said.
Bolton, a program officer in the U.S. State Department’s Sports Diplomacy Division, works with U.S. embassies to increase dialogue and cultural connectivity among people around the world through sports, where skateboarding has started to take a prominent place with its introduction into the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
“Skateboarding is particularly powerful,” Bolton said. “It is this new entry point for us. It promotes the concept of entrepreneurism.”
Simril, president and CEO of LA84, a foundation supporting youth sports organizations in southern California, grew up skateboarding and added to Bolton’s comment about the transformative power of skateboarding.
“The unstructured nature of skateboarding frightens the establishment,” Simril said.
When discussing the evolution of the status of skateboarding in society, Ross, vice president of community engagement at The Kennedy Center and contributor to the project “Finding a Line: Skateboarding, Music, and Media,” said that authenticity is the best way to have skateboarding remain on an upward trend in society. 
Schillereff similarly commented on his anticipation about the positivity surrounding skate culture, but he noted that it will be a while before such recognition comes full circle. 
“As skaters we’re excited about the change that’s happening,” Schillereff said. “We’re waiting for the world to catch up with us.”
Following the audience’s applause and a brief intermission, the second part of the event, “Public Diplomacy and Globalization through Skateboarding, Media, Science, and the Arts,” began. Three new panelists were introduced: professional skateboarders Rodney Mullen, Vanessa Torres and Chris “Dune” Pastras.
Shifting the discussion toward identity and global citizenship in skateboarding, Williams began by addressing each panelist’s attitudes toward skateboarding and the community. 
“Skating became a voice for me. It gave me an understanding of movement,” Mullen said.
Named one of the most influential skateboarders of all time, Mullen has won 35 world titles and is the co-founder of the original World Industries, Almost Skateboards and Dwindle Distribution. In addition, most of the tricks done in the more modern era (the street ollie, kickflip and 360-flip) evolved from his technique. 
“[With skateboarding] there’s a sense of, ‘I was a part of something bigger that happened,’” Mullen said.
Pastras is a broadcast host and skateboarding legend who co-founded World Industries and Stereo Skateboards. As one of the first major black skateboarding figures, Pastras contributed to diversity in the skateboarding world with his initiative to put a black character on boards where only white characters existed previously. 
Now, Pastras illustrates how Cuba is a prime example of skateboarding and diplomacy, as the collectivist culture that skateboarding encourages has made a connection for Cuban youth trapped in an era where trade embargos shut Cubans off from most of the world.
Torres, the first female skateboarder to win a gold medal at the 2003 X Games, has also made strides with skateboarding and diversity in the United States, but she said that these achievements came from her identifying as a skateboarder first. 
“I never felt that my sexuality was a big focal point in my career,” Torres said. “I was appreciated for my gift and talent and contribution to women’s skateboarding. I just happened to be gay.” 
From diplomacy to identity, skate culture’s growing prominence has taken the world by storm in ways that are continually unveiled. Even with its integration into everyday culture and its new spot in the 2020 Summer Olympics, what keeps skate culture pushing forward is its ability to maintain its roots despite societal advancements. 
“Skateboarding, before it’s a sport, is an art,” Schillereff said. “If they don’t build parks, we don’t care and will tear up the streets anyways.”

Catherine Yang | Daily Trojan
Last November, on the Promenade des Berges overlooking the Seine, I realized I was afraid of what it meant to be a woman. I was 18, three months into college, alone in Paris and forced to confront the implications of the femininity I’d barely grown into for the first time. 
Bearing my wooliest scarf and a tote brimming with books and pens, I had planned to spend a quiet afternoon next to the river, alone with Patti Smith’s memoir and my own thoughts. Minutes later, a man at least 20 years my senior seemingly materialized before me and tried to strike up a conversation. 
I gave curt but friendly responses in the best broken French I could muster and kept a stagnant smile on my face in the hopes that the awkward encounter would end and I could return to my reading. He asked if he could take a photo of me because I looked so beautiful. Politely, I declined. Undeterred, he persisted. Increasingly discomforted, I defected again. He made a sudden move, as if to forcefully remove my phone from my lap and as I recoiled instinctively, he played it off as placing his arm across the bench behind me. I stammered that I had to leave and as I left in a haste, he told me that I had made him sad. 
As I boarded the métro home, I felt a surge of vulnerability. Evidently, I couldn’t even go to a park alone without being targeted just for being there. What intimidated me most wasn’t that he’d tried to touch me without permission but that he felt so entitled to my body he tried to guilt me for my response. 
And this wasn’t an isolated incident. There were the people who got handsy in Parisian clubs without me even making eye contact with them. There were the countless acts of street harassment, from the jovial to the menacing. There was the guy who used the mosh pit at The Growlers’ concert to press into me while I couldn’t fight back, which I decided against writing about in detail because it was more graphic than I feel comfortable sharing. 
For a long time, I felt like I couldn’t talk about these instances because they seemed banal in contrast to the tales of full-fledged assault and rape circulating in the news. I joined the ranks of women and men who defined sexual harassment as something meant to remain unspoken, private and unacknowledged. Although they shouldn’t have, these moments happened and I felt lucky that I remained unharmed. But, in a colloquial sense, “harassment” encompasses a wide range of misbehavior that is of an entirely different category than “assault.” To declare kinship with those who had sustained more serious acts of violence seemed inappropriate to me. 
But last week, in light of the #MeToo social media movement, a capacious umbrella of solidarity opened up — and included me. The outpouring of tens of thousands of responses has become a powerful testament to the sheer scope of the problem, far more moving and widespread than mere statistics could ever be. 
Although women’s voices have been speaking the loudest, we must be cautious about branding this as a social issue that pits the genders against each other. This is primarily an issue of aggressors versus victims, regardless of gender. The internet has created a safe space for men and women alike to speak out in a way that engenders self-empowerment but refrains from purporting blame — it is a show of hands rather than a pointing of fingers. 
There are still tremendous strides to be made in the fight for individuals to feel safe in their own bodies. Next week, we may very well fade back into the passivity characteristic of most forms of social media activism and lay dormant until the next high-profile sexual harassment scandal. But during its 15 minutes of fame, the #MeToo movement accomplished exactly what it intended: It exposed the magnitude of the problem. It was neither a call to action nor a retaliation against perpetrators. It merely forced all social media users to confront the appalling reality that tens of thousands of men and women have been regularly encountering their own Harvey Weinsteins but, for whatever reason, did nothing and believed that nobody cared. But uncovering the colossal scale of the problem is revolutionary in its own right. If it can teach just one young girl in Paris that her experiences are normal rather than shameful, that’s not nothing. I, for one, no longer feel alone.

Redshirt quarterback Sam Darnold scrambles to turn the corner to avoid a tackle against Notre Dame in South Bend, Ind. Photo by Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
On Tuesday, No. 21 USC returned to the practice field after falling to 6-2 on the season. The Trojans looked to clean up offensive issues after a 49-14 blowout loss to Notre Dame. 
USC seeks to limit offensive mistakes 
On Saturday, USC’s offense mustered just 76 rushing yards, while giving up two turnovers and five sacks. Redshirt junior left tackle Toa Lobendahn chalked the issues up to the offensive line losing individual battles at the line of scrimmage. 
“It’d be like four guys doing one thing right and one guy messes up,” Lobendahn said. “I don’t think we had missed assignments, [we were] just being beat physically, whether it was someone’s head placement not being right or the d-line just getting off the block.” 
After a tough outing for the offense on both the line and at the skill positions, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold saw improvement in the unit’s flow on Tuesday. 
“We’re not where we need to be, but we’re making strides,” Darnold said. “Some young guys are continuing to play well and it’s good to see that. But at the same time, we need to fix some things and we did that today in practice.” 
Pittman Sr.’s Tweets
On Monday, sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr.’s father, a former Super Bowl champion running back, put out a series of tweets lamenting USC’s use of his son and questioning the coaching staff. At one point, Pittman Sr. tweeted that he was “beyond disappointed,” saying, “I trusted them with my kid and they have let me down.”
After receiving limited action his freshman year, Pittman Jr. entered this season with a lingering ankle injury that prevented him from seeing action until Week 5 against Washington State. He has three catches for 41 yards so far. 
“He’s been playing,” said offensive coordinator Tee Martin in response to the Twitter rant. “Sometimes at wideout the ball doesn’t find you all the time but it’s not by design or we’re sitting here wanting to take one of our best players out of the game.”
Martin added that he, Pittman Jr. and head coach Clay Helton sat down and had a “very positive meeting” where they assessed his progress. When asked about his father’s comments, the receiver said that he had not seen his dad’s tweets but planned on speaking to him about them soon. 
Injury Report 
Helton said that junior cornerback Iman Marshall will remain day-to-day with an MCL sprain. He also noted that both junior outside linebacker Porter Gustin and freshman running back Stephen Carr returned to practice in some capacity, each participating in light, non-contact drills. 
Part of the problem from the ND game is the ND defense knew our offensive playbook, jumped the snap and played with more heart. Why?  Here’s my conspiracy theory…..
Some facts:
1. Wazzu beat USC after 2 weeks of prep
2.  ND beat USC after 2 weeks of prep
3.  If ND doesn’t win this game they are out of the 4-team 2017 CFB playoff games.  This game and all that follow, but this one especially would’ve taken them out of contention.
4.  ND doesn’t play in a conference, thus they do not have an opportunity to play in a conference championship game, hence item #3.
5.  USC does play in a conference and has a chance to win the South Division and play in the Pac-12 Championship Game on Friday, December 31, 2017.
6.  Many of USC’s starters are hurt and Coach Helton and even Pete Carroll have made it very clear that the goal is to win the South Division and even the Pac-12 Conference game.
What is the biggest factor that USC must consider in order to achieve item #5?
It is the ability to manage the health of the starters and the ability for as many of the starters to contribute and play the last 4 games of the Pac-12 South and the Pac-12 Championship Game.
At the moment, ASU and Zona are on fire and are contenders to take USC out of the South title. The Vegas odds have USC at -3 in Tempe.  We should win, but trust in Tee Martin’s play calling is subject to criticism at this time.  His post game interview was embarrassing, as he looked like a deer in the headlights.
So, here’s the theory:
Even though the ND game is the most well-known rivalry game in our two school’s history, Helton could not afford to lose any of the starters that have been out and play them for the ND game. He’d rather keep them out of that game and give them another week of rehab, as losing that game does not interfere with the stated goal of winning the Pac-12 South and going to the Pac-12 Champ Game. 
I believe Helton did play the game to win, no doubt about it, but by playing as many inexperienced kids as they did, and the coaching decisions made or not made, by not paying attention to the details, doomed this team to a loss. The loss is an acceptable loss to Helton for the time being because it’s an out-of-conference loss, as he is rolling the dice on winning out and winning the Pac-12 CG.  Going 10-2 at the end of the year is acceptable to him.  It is not acceptable to any of us, knowing how much talent we have.  
Now, spotting ND 21 points in the first half does not bode well for a comeback victory.  As much as we would’ve loved to have watched Sam Darnold pull another one out, he’s not there right now. Too many mistakes by everyone on offense, defense, special teams, coaching and especially the mental and emotional aspect.  Players were not coached effectively and came out flat. Heck, even the ND defense knew our plays better than our starting freshman linemen.
Sam’s comments a few weeks back about the play calling was a tell-tale sign about what’s going on inside the locker room.  Yes, he was forced to apologize, but the fact that he said it, and I believe Sam would not start up stuff to be reported on by the press like Josh Rosen did a few months ago.  
Also, the Season of Sam podcast that Sam is prepping for and recording every week takes time from his school work and football responsibilities, so I don’t know why Helton, Swann and even Nikias would allow it. Honestly, it’s not that good and Sam should go back to being a student athlete. He already has a very pressure packed high profile responsibility for the team’s success laid squarely on his shoulders.
If our team goes less than 10-2 this season and does not win the Pac-12 South, I don’t think Helton will be fired, as USC must keep him for 3 years. What high-end coach would take the USC job if he saw a pattern where the HC gets fired after 2 years.  USC AD Pat Haden has already set the standard for hiring coaches that should not have been there, and the he fired them in a manner that did not show me any style or class. 
With that said, Coach Helton will have to bring in a new set of assistant coaches just like Brian Kelly did last year after going 4-8.  He fired the coaches and hired new guys, and look what they’ve accomplished. For the most part, the same guys that USC beat last year, beat USC this year by a greater margin.  OK take the 21 points away and who knows who would’ve won.  But facts are facts. 
Next year, the ND seniors that proliferate their O & D lines and secondary will be gone.  Our guys will be juniors and seniors, more experienced and we will take ND to the woodshed again.  Keep the faith, baby!
Faith, family and football is a fine mantra for the team, but there needs to be an emphasis on overpowering the opponent’s linemen, both offensive and defensive lines.  Perhaps the mantra should be Faith, Family, Football, and Take No Prisoners.  THank you Lord.   It’s not there.
Again, IMHO.
Fight On.
Beat the Sun Devils.
Put out the fire.

The No. 5 women’s soccer team (13-1-1) returns home from a successful Washington weekend road trip ready to play host to a challenging No. 16 Cal (13-2-1) team on Thursday. 
Cal will represent the toughest test for the Trojans this season as the conclusion of the Pac-12 season arrives. The Golden Bears played Oregon on Sunday at home, downing the Ducks 3-0. Oregon was able to keep the score respectable for the entire first half, entering halftime tied 0-0. However, as the game went on, the Ducks defense started to fall apart. Three goals in 10 minutes from the Cal offense resigned Oregon to its fate, as Cal outshot the Ducks 14-8 (8-3 on target) this game.
Cal is led in scoring by sophomore midfielder Abi Kim and junior forward Miranda Nild, who have 7 and 6 goals, respectively, this season. These two represent the key pieces of the Cal attack and will need to be marked at all times by the USC defense.
The Golden Bears are a very dangerous team not only in attack — as demonstrated by the exploits by Kim and Nild — but also in defense, only conceding 6 goals all season. In comparison, the Trojans have conceded 9 goals this season. Cal has also been high-scoring this season, netting 1.56 goals per game compared to its opponent’s 0.38 goals per game. 
The Trojans will have to find a way to break down the Golden Bears’ defense, which is led by seniors Indigo Gibson and Haley Lukas, who have started 16 and 15 of Cal’s games this season, respectively. The Trojans will continue to rely on senior forward Alex Anthony, who scored yet again this past weekend, netting twice against Washington, bringing her goal tally up to 7 this season. 
She is helped by junior forward Leah Pruitt, who also scored this past weekend, putting her name on the scoresheet in Sunday’s game against Washington State. Both will hope to continue their scoring form tomorrow as the Cal defense will not be easy to score against. Chances will be few and far between, so the Trojans’ offense will have to be on high alert and not waste any chances. 
This game will pit free-scoring offenses against stringent defenses, not prone to many mistakes and allowing easy goal-scoring opportunities. This game — placing USC (second in the Pac-12 standings) against Cal (tied for third in the Pac-12 standings) — will be an a great barometer for the Trojans, as they will be able to see how they compare with a Pac-12 and national powerhouse. The Trojans’ offense and defense will both have to show up ready to play and battle, knowing that this Cal team represents their greatest test yet. 
The offense will have to take its opportunities when given, making each chance count, while the defense will have to remain strong, not allowing the Golden Bears to attack any open spaces in the defense. 
If the Trojans can accomplish these tasks, a place in the top five of the national rankings is certainly achievable and will provide a confidence booster for the following two games against No. 1 Stanford and No. 6 UCLA.

Senior safety Chris Hawkins tackles Notre Dame quarterback Brandon Wimbush. Photo by Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
Shotgun snap. Notre Dame quarterback Brandon Wimbush hands the ball off to running back Josh Adams, who hesitates behind the line of scrimmage for half a second, accelerates between the tackles and takes the ball 84 yards for the score. With the touchdown, Notre Dame brought its lead back up to four touchdowns and hammered the final nail in the coffin late in the third quarter against an uninspired USC team trying to mount a late comeback in South Bend on Saturday. 
While it was their longest play of the night, it was not a surprise for the Fighting Irish, who averaged a robust eight yards per carry against the Trojans. 
“Credit Notre Dame,” head coach Clay Helton said after the defeat. “They won the battle in the trenches tonight.” 
That comes across as a bit of an understatement, as Notre Dame rushed for more yards against USC than it had since 1950 and outgained the Trojans on the ground by over 300 yards. The Irish didn’t just win the battle in the trenches — they dominated it. This wasn’t a massive surprise given that Notre Dame has one of the most experienced offensive lines in the country, and USC was dealing with several key injuries, including the loss of starting defensive lineman Josh Fatu, whose presence was sorely missed. But redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold and the team refused to make excuses after the loss.
“They were better than us tonight,” junior linebacker Cam Smith said. 
For a team that entered the season with playoff aspirations, this loss hurt. 
“It was embarrassing,” senior team captain Chris Hawkins said after the game. “I’m embarrassed.” 
This loss cannot be blamed entirely on the defense however, as USC faltered in all three phases of the game. USC rushed the ball 12 times in the opening half for a total of negative four yards. The Trojans didn’t score a point in the first half and entered the locker room trailing by 28. USC also fumbled a punt, missed a field goal and threw an interception in a sloppily played half of football. 
“We helped them by mistakes,” Helton said after the game. 
USC’s offense could not overcome the plethora of negative plays in the run game, and Darnold was running for his life for most of the game due to poor protection. USC looked overmatched and outclassed on the field Saturday, and the 35-point loss was indicative of that. 
The fight in the trenches was not the only battle USC lost this weekend, as Notre Dame won the turnover battle as well. The Irish took the ball from USC three times without committing a turnover of their own. Carelessness with the ball and offensive miscues  plagued the Trojans all season, and they are now tied for the second most turnovers in the FBS, giving away possession 19 times in eight games.
However, USC’s season is not lost.
“There’s still a lot to play for in this season,” Helton said. “There’s not only the Pac-12 South Championship but a Pac-12 Championship.” 
Fortunately for USC, this was not a conference game and thus will not affect the Trojans’ standing in the conference, where they still control their destiny. This is a luxury the team was not afforded last year after its 1-3 start, a point Helton wants to emphasize.
The team is focusing on its next test against Arizona State this Saturday. 
“We’re going to bounce back,” said Darnold, who has been responsible for 15 turnovers this season after entering as the Heisman frontrunner.
It seems unlikely this late in the season that USC can recapture the magic that led the Trojans to win their final nine games last year and finish in the top three in the final AP poll. However, unlikely doesn’t mean much to Darnold, who is typically unflappable in pressure situations. 
“Sam gives us the best opportunity to win a Pac-12 championship,” Helton said. “He’s hurting in there right now because his team didn’t win.”

Trevor Denton | Daily Trojan
When USC played Utah two weeks ago, I was out of town for a wedding. 
During the reception, my dad and I were able to sneak up to our hotel room and watch college football, right when the Cupid Shuffle was just beginning to pick up (impeccable timing if I might add). My dad, a lifelong Georgia fan and grad, watched the Bulldogs play Missouri on his phone, and I watched the Utah game on the TV screen (bigger game, bigger screen — our family has some strict rules when it comes to sports). 
Once Georgia gained a comfortable lead, my dad’s attention swayed more and more towards the TV. It was the first time this season that we were able to take in a USC game together at the same time in the same place. What was my dad’s biggest takeaway after watching the Trojans fight and claw for a comeback victory over the Utes? 
“Darnold just isn’t ready yet,” he stated matter of factly, not even needing to say what the quarterback was not ready for. 
After hearing similar comments dating back to the Western Michigan game, for the first time I agreed. Darnold is just not ready for the NFL. 
Outside of my dad’s opinion on Darnold, many are echoing similar sentiments that the redshirt sophomore quarterback should stay in school for another year. Reports have surfaced this week indicating that he’s leaning toward another year on campus. Whether or not that is true, it seems reasonable to assume that there’s a chance he’s staying at USC after this season. It’s certainly not a foregone conclusion like it was after the Rose Bowl when he was the talk of the NFL Combine one year before even being eligible for the draft. His status is certainly unclear enough to where that guy who wore a Jets Darnold jersey at the Cal game is questioning his purchase at least a little bit (for two reasons — the 3-4 Jets are also much better than expected). 
Just because I don’t think Darnold is ready for the NFL does not mean I see him as a bad player. In fact, at times he borders on incredible. He makes inhuman throws on the run, he evades tacklers and he has a tendency to thrive in big moments and situations (like the Rose Bowl and Texas game). 
But now that he’s played a more full sampling of college games, it’s clear: Darnold just doesn’t know how to take care of the football. Through eight games, he’s thrown 10 interceptions and lost seven fumbles, giving USC the second most turnovers in FBS. I have reached the point where I can’t defend his 2017 campaign anymore. 
When Darnold fumbled on the offense’s first snap against Notre Dame on Saturday, it set the tone for the team’s utter dismantling, but it also summarized his season so far. He has constantly put himself and his team in situations that even he can’t escape from. 
Despite his knack for turning the ball over, many draft experts are still placing the redshirt sophomore high on their boards. In Mel Kiper Jr.’s latest “Big Board” update, he kept Darnold as his number one overall prospect, citing his “big frame,” and “quick decisions.” Todd McShay recently commented that he was “not concerned about Darnold’s picks,” and that he “[loves] his ability to manipulate the pocket and keep his eyes downfield.” 
Darnold could very well end up being a top choice in this year’s draft regardless of how many interceptions he throws or fumbles he loses. After all, Deshaun Watson threw 17 interceptions during his junior year and still ended up being the No. 12 overall pick and is already a leading candidate for Rookie of the Year (and through six NFL games, he’s only thrown five interceptions). Perhaps a pro coaching staff will fix some of his mechanics and repair his decision making process. Regardless, Darnold should absolutely stay on campus for one more year. The NFL isn’t going anywhere and neither should Darnold. 
Coaches are thrilled when they land five star prospects out of high school. Imagine the USC staff’s jubilation if Darnold, a Rose Bowl MVP and Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year returns. Not only would he instantly make the Trojans national title contenders again, but he would be able to hone his craft in a comfortable environment without the insane pressures of the NFL. This season may be a lost cause, but if Darnold comes back next year, he will have one more chance to solidify a legacy as one of the greatest quarterbacks in USC history. 
Darnold may not be ready for the NFL, but that’s OK. One more year on campus will only improve his confidence and maturity once he reaches the pros. The league will still be waiting.
