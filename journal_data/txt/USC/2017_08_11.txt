With heavy hitters like  the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and The Getty Center right in USC’s backyard, Los Angeles is undoubtedly a world-class destination for the fine arts. But really, you can only look at so many pleasant post-impressionist paintings before you start to crave something a little quirkier, and a little more offbeat. Here are some peculiar museums to check out on the days that you decide to take the road less traveled. 
MUSEUM OF NEON ART
The current Museum of Neon Art opened in Glendale, in 2016.
Los Angeles is immediately evocative of garish fluorescence, and nowhere is this flashiness more displayed than at the Museum of Neon Art. Exhibiting exclusively electric media, the nonexistent overhead lighting intensifies the brightly lit installations, which emit an otherworldly glow. In addition, novices and experts alike have the chance to take classes taught by established artists familiar with the neon medium, often toting home their own neon sculptures and signs after the sessions. The museum also offers night tours, where participants can board a bus that transports them through the glittering urban jungle of Los Angeles, past the old-fashioned movie marquees of Downtown, the luminous pagodas of  Chinatown, and, of course, the timeless radiance of Hollywood. 
MUSEUM OF JURASSIC TECHNOLOGY
Truth is often stranger than fiction, but it’s up to the visitor to distinguish between the two at the Museum of Jurassic Technology, also appropriately monikered the Strangest Museum in America. This modern-day cabinet of curiosities displays artifacts such as the Deprong Mori bat, allegedly able to fly through solid objects due to the ultraviolet rays it transmits, and a horn mounted to the wall that purportedly grew out of the back of a woman’s head, but doesn’t specify which are bona fide and which are mala fide. Founder David Hildebrand Wilson has said that the museum is a “love letter” to the concept of museums, and the objets d’art they are meant to present. Some people walk out with an epiphany; others simply wonder what the hell they just saw, but all agree that it is a worthy experience. 
MUSEUM OF DEATH
There’s nothing subtle about this museum. Upon entering, visitors are greeted with a giant skull painting, as well as a grim reminder: Death is everywhere. The winding, maze-like interior shepherds people from a room plastered with the personal correspondence and doodles of notorious serial killers, to a miniature mortuary where a clinical step-by-step video plays instructions on how to embalm a corpse, to a full-scale reproduction of the Heaven’s Gate cult members dead in their beds. Plus, the building, which used to be a recording studio, is completely sound-proofed, with the oppressive silence sure to make the hairs on the back of your neck prickle. Warning: featuring extremely graphic photos depicting the remains of murder victims in every gory, glorious detail, this museum is not for the squeamish, fainthearted or emesis-prone. 
MUSEUM OF BROKEN RELATIONSHIPS
Just down the street from the Museum of Death is another equally cheerless institution: the Museum of Broken Relationships. Two Croatian artists, Olinka Vištica and Dražen Grubiši, began adopting keepsakes left over from friends’ breakups, a collection that eventually grew so large that in 2016, a second branch opened up in the heart of Hollywood (the first museum is located in Zagreb, Croatia). Visitors wander through an eclectic selection of objects such as cheerleading outfits, pickle jars, and lipsticked mirrors, each accompanied by a brief explanation of the item’s sentimental value. Strangely, this museum is a popular date destination, so come here if you want to discuss with your significant other which relic representative of your relationship you’d donate in the highly unlikely, entirely hypothetical situation that you separate.

The Warrior-Scholar Project returns for its third year at USC to provide a week-long academic training and guidance for veterans of the United States Armed Forces. 
Dubbed a “boot camp” by the Los Angeles Times, the program is intense, filled with rigorous lectures and discussions. When asked what sets the Warrior-Scholar Project apart from other veterans’ programs, Amy Page, the program’s curriculum manager at USC, had a straightforward response.
“We actually do what we say we’re going to do,” Page said. 
The Warrior-Scholar Project aims to facilitate a smooth transition from military life to collegiate life for veterans, integrating them into a regular school environment. 
The USC chapter currently has 20 students,  ranging in age from early 20s to late 50s. Regardless of age, the program aims to help participants become more well-informed and confident intellectuals in the field of academics.
Although the Warrior-Scholar Project is only one week long, its veterans become immersed in their fields of study. According to Page, their academic lectures are open-ended, encouraging discussion among the students. 
The lecture topics are centered on democracy and its manifestations in the United States in recent years. While discussing various political, economic and social issues, the students spoke about their observations and perspectives of society.
“In the military, we’re molded to act one way,” said Jonathan Anda, a five-year veteran participant of the program. “Now, though, we need to know how to put things in perspective.” 
Before the program, Anda said he had a mindset geared only toward following orders, working to maximize conciseness and efficiency. Now, he feels more creative and open-minded. 
Almost every individual involved in facilitating or managing the Warrior-Scholar Project has either served in the military or is a family member of someone who has. Because of this, the students feel that the instructors are especially helpful. 
“The best way to describe this program is that it’s truly for the veterans by the veterans,” said Angel Arambula, a four-year veteran participant. 
Alumni of the program also drop by the week-long session and help to instill confidence in the current generation of students. 
Matt Maclaine is a five-year veteran and an alumni ambassador to the Warrior-Scholar Project. He attended the program as a student in 2013 at Yale’s campus and is currently an aerospace engineering student at UC Irvine. Now, he returns as a mentor for his fellow servicemen and women.
Maclaine emphasized that the program benefited him greatly. 
“Skills like analytical writing have really set us up for success,” Maclaine said. “All veterans need to hear about this program.”
