It’s not easy to bring together two religions — especially Judaism and Islam. At USC, however, all it takes is a little communication and some good (kosher) food.
Starting this Wednesday, an interfaith initiative co-sponsored by Chabad USC and the Muslim Student Union is bringing two kosher food trucks to campus multiple times a week.
Students in search of more kosher or halal food options at USC can now look forward to food trucks Shawarma Mia and the Kosher Palate setting up shop in the University Church parking lot every Tuesday and Wednesday from 11 a.m to 2 p.m, offering up classic Middle Eastern dishes such as shawarma and malawach.
Rabbi Dov Wagner of Chabad initially came up with the idea of providing more kosher choices for students at USC, which, until this point, had very limited kosher meal options. This was a natural extension of the new Chabad meal plan, which provides kosher food to students on weeknights at the Chabad House on Severance Street.
He reached out to USC’s Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, who helped facilitate the process of bringing the trucks to campus and connecting the rabbi with the Muslim Students Union.
Soni, in conjunction with sophomore Daniel Silvermintz, president of the Chabad Student Board, reached out to the MSU.
“Soni contacted me about advertising the food trucks in our newsletter, and then Daniel was kind enough to reach out to discuss further potential opportunities for the MSU and Chabad to work together,” said junior Engie Salama, president of the MSU.
In Judaism, food has to meet certain requirements of Jewish law to be considered kosher, or “proper” in Hebrew. Similarly, in Islam, food has to meet certain Islamic dietary guidelines to be considered halal, or “permissible” in Arabic. Both religions’ dietary restrictions are similar in certain ways — for example, both restrict the consumption of pork.
“We wanted to work with the Muslim Student Union because of our common dietary restrictions,” Silvermintz says.
Salama responded enthusiastically.
“Not only do I believe that having such options would broaden the food selections of a large part of our Muslim and Jewish community, I think it also helps in bridging friendly relations between the two religions over something everyone can enjoy: delicious food!” Salama said.
Silvermintz said that this interfaith initiative is occurring now because of the overwhelming need on campus for such options.
“It is happening now because we have been working very hard these past few semesters to provide more kosher options,” he said. “We have been making great strides to provide more kosher options, and it is now easier than ever to keep kosher on campus.”
Salama also added that, since it is the beginning of the year, it is the perfect time to start the precedent of the two organizations working together with the hope that this initiative will open up more avenues  to work together to help students adjust to USC, especially international students or those who follow strict dietary rules in each respective religion.
According to both Silvermintz and Salama, relations today between Chabad and the MSU are very good.
“We have been working well together in promoting these trucks, and it is making life easier for both Jewish and Muslim students on campus,” Silvermintz said. “When Engie and I met, we discussed how we can relate about many of the obstacles to observing religion on campus and how it is in both of our best interests to ensure the successful execution of initiatives such as this.”
Salama was also optimistic about the opportunity to create a mutually beneficial relationship.
“I would like to say that we’re turning a new page for the mutual benefit of both organizations. I look forward to working with Daniel so that our respective groups can learn to understand one another and focus on the ideals that bring us together — the similarities in our religions, the strict dietary observances and ultimately, building peace in an environment that can only be found at a place like USC.”
Silvermintz hopes it will be a successful venture, adding that the food trucks will only come as long as they have enough customers. In addition to the added choices of delicious kosher food on campus, these trucks will allow Chabad and the Muslim Student Union to work together successfully — a cooperative venture that is all too rare today.
“Diet is a concern both of our constituents consider on a daily basis, and any efforts that would improve the options available to our students are worthwhile undertakings,” Salama said.

What I find perplexing about these events is there sharp contrast with what happens in Islamic countries.  In Islamic countries the opposite happens.
In the last week alone Muslim interfaith experiences with non-Muslims have principally involved the murder and maiming of hundreds of non-Muslims and/or Muslims of different sects.  
One could almost get the impression these feel-good events are intended to fool us into thinking Islam is a tolerant, compassionate and peaceful religion when in fact it is anything but.  Read the Quran, Hadiths and Sunna to discover how intolerant, lacking in compassion and warlike Islam really is.  Or simply observe their actions because they speak louder than their words.
Or you could realize that every religion has its extremists, that Jews, Muslims, Christians, Druze, etc can get along, all the Mosaic faiths have hadith/halachot/canon law that can be twisted in the service of extremism and thank G-d we live in the USA.
You can’t spell Challah without Allah, bra!

English indie rock band The xx amazed the City of Angels with its Coexist tour on Sunday. Thousands of excited fans crowded into the Hollywood Bowl to experience the staggering grace that the duo brought to their performance.

It might be a little absurd to call The xx one of the defining bands of our age, but, then again, Radiohead and Nirvana also had to start somewhere. The past decade has been a re-examination for the music industry — shifting away from the robotic performances, almost too-perfect staging and excess stress to haphazard and stray vocals and unwavering emotional honesty.
For The xx, this revolution in music has merely emphasized the band’s personality in its performances, appearing smooth and stylish to the touch.
Instead of refining its style to match that of other past and current indie bands, The xx has brought a lightness to the indie genre. The band shares its lyrics on social media with its fans, but still manages to retain a wondrous mystique that could baffle any Vampire Weekend or Two Door Cinema Club fan.
And even though honesty might be one of The xx’s most enticing qualities, the listener also can’t overlook its artistry. The band’s passion for music was on display Sunday, not only in its vocals, but also in the band’s ability to sing for a crowd of thousands in an outdoor venue. The performance served to reinforce that The xx is clearly a band of never-aging high school guitarists and fervent vocalists.
The songs themselves are miniature examples of The xx’s carefully crafted musical style. The band paired its best hits, “Sunset” and “Angel,” with hypnotic sounds from an electronic piano. Bass guitarist Oliver Sim played with confidence, and both Romy Madley Croft and Sim often sang into the same microphone, feeding off the group dynamic.
Jamie Smith, a.k.a. Jamie xx, ran the beats with a striking intensity. Jamie xx not only stunned the crowd with her vocals, but with a genuine and endearing vulnerability. She and her bandmates would often tell the crowd how thankful they were to be playing at the Hollywood Bowl. The band’s most popular hits such as “VCR” and “Fiction” kept their show alive, reviving the energy of the performance as the diverse crowd bobbed their heads and swayed to the sounds of the choruses.
As far as special effects, The xx took a page out of today’s electronic music scene and incorporated a laser show into their performance. It wasn’t the kind of laser show that one would expect at a typical rave. It was a mellow, relaxed show to sit back and enjoy.
Clad in black, the band demonstrated its loyalty to the indie rock genre by keeping their outfits simple yet sophisticated, with touches of European fashion in their black leather jackets and urban tanks and tees.
Special mention must go to Jamie xx, whose vigor for presentation could not be trivialized, and who crafted the band’s songs to match the open-air venue of the Hollywood Bowl. The stadium meshed perfectly with the band’s desire to showcase talent. Miraculously effortless, elaborately restrained and sleekly idiosyncratic — The xx could not have picked a more appropriate venue for its performance.
The band’s newest album, Coexist, features a mix of relaxed vibes and cool tones that you would imagine listening to in a high-end bar or upscale lounge in New York City. For this very reason, many fans were concerned about how such calm vocals would sound in a stadium known for its resonance and astonishing energy level. A venue with the pedigree of the Hollywood Bowl is meant for the Maroon 5s and Lady Gagas of the world. Regardless, The xx once again left the crowd shocked by its stunning talent and ability to rise above what is expected.
After The xx completes a six-date tour of North America that started on Sept. 20, the band will head to South America for dates in Bogota, Colombia and Santiago, Chile.

Google has a lot to be proud of.
Having just celebrated its 15th birthday along with the release of its newest search algorithm, Hummingbird, Google continuously tops the rankings for lists such as most innovative, most desired workplace and more. As one of the biggest tech companies in Silicon Valley, Google has accumulated the time and money to devote to other projects and acquisitions including Waze, Android, YouTube and 126 others.
Though Google isn’t perfect — especially regarding the negative press it has received for its privacy concerns — let’s be honest. If you’re running a startup right now, I’m sure you wouldn’t mind if it turned into the next Google.
Despite the jackpots it has hit with its acquisitions, however, not all of them have turned out so well. In fact, in an interview with TechCrunch in 2012, David Lawee, Google’s vice president of corporate development, revealed that one-third of Google’s acquisitions fail.
Then again, what exactly defines failure?
Because there’s one acquisition that Google made back in 2011 for a modest $125 million that still makes me scratch my head.
That acquisition? Zagat.
Looking back, perhaps it wasn’t such a strange move. In fact, in 2009, Google attempted to woo Yelp over to its side with $500 million, but failed to do so. At the time, the dawn of the review era was becoming more widespread, particularly with sites such as Foursquare and aforementioned Yelp. People are more likely to trust reviews now since advertisements have turned us into crabby and skeptical consumers.
Menus and recommendations for restaurants are also just two of the many, many search terms that people otherwise Google. But think about all of the people in the world looking up menus and restaurants. It’s certainly a lot of web traffic, and you can’t blame Google for wanting to get in on it.
Even so, the acquisition seemed rushed, as if Google bought Zagat without fully knowing what to do with the company afterward. In a Business Insider article published in late June, the internal issues at Zagat, due to the change in leadership, were hashed out. Because Google, specifically then-VP Marissa Mayer, wanted to push Zagat in an editorial direction, many employees were under contract and were not promised permanent jobs which, predictably, made people very angry.
The editorial push hasn’t been so successful anyway.
Zagat has always been known as the Consumer Reports for restaurants, particularly for its eponymous reviews. But once Zagat started to push content, site visitors became disinterested — or so it’s implied. In July, Google relaunched its website and mobile apps so that no payments or registration are required — an uncharacteristic move toward anonymity on Google’s part.
Despite this failure, Google is still trying to find a home for Zagat.
Google+ has shown some potential for Zagat. With more than 3 million people following Zagat, there’s room for interactivity through means such as Google Hangouts with food experts and chefs.
To bolster the review aspect of Google, the company launched Google City Experts in August, which selects a number of Google+ users and guarantees them Google swag and entrance into special events. In other words, an eerily similar version of Yelp’s Elite Squad.
And when looking for a restaurant’s website, don’t be surprised to see that one of the first results will most likely be paired with a rating based on Google’s reviews.
Even Sergey Brin’s young brother, Sam Brin, is trying his luck in the restaurant industry with his startup, Butter Systems, one of many digital menu ordering platforms out there.
Zagat isn’t a lost cause, but there still doesn’t seem to be much of a direction for the reviews site. Yelp and Foursquare dominate the restaurant review space, and though the thought of being a part of Google as a City Expert sounds cool, it isn’t very easy. First, you have to use Google+.
That eliminates a lot of us.
Second, you have to write at least five reviews a month. Sounds pretty doable, but if you forget to do a fifth review in any given month, you lose your fancy title.
I understand that review quotas guarantee consistency. Yelp, for example, is a little more whimsical when it comes to doling out its Elite statuses. I’m not saying Google should color outside the lines, per se. With its doodles, boundaries are being pushed, but slowly.
There needs to be a plan for Zagat, and I think Google+ might just be one way to make the most of the acquisition. If Zagat started offering private cooking classes or personal meet-and-greets through Hangouts, then more people, particularly those with a love for food, might start flocking over to both Google+ and Zagat. It might not hurt to try and revamp the Zagat review system to make it even more reliable and trustworthy than the systems that its competitors use.
Revenue aside — since 97 percent of Google’s profits come from advertising — if Zagat doesn’t have a strong enough user base three to five years from now, I think it would be in Google’s best interest to abandon the acquisition altogether, especially if it starts to cost more to maintain.
But it could only be a matter of time. As a self-proclaimed Yelper, a part of me wants to try out Google City Experts, since it could turn out to be a completely different experience. And if Zagat can get its creative juices flowing, perhaps we’ll see a new take on the intersection of food and tech soon.

In the states, the name “Doni Burger” might be met with a shrug of the shoulders or a quizzical, “What is that?”
But in Korea, Doni Burger enjoys a reputation as one of the country’s best burger joints.
To put it a different way: Doni Burger is to Koreans as In-N-Out is to Californians.
Founded, owned and run by popular South Korean comedian and entertainer Jung Hyung Don (who goes by the nickname “Doni”), the fast food chain is known abroad for erring on the more expensive side but offering high quality, fresh ingredients, handmade patties and fresh baked buns.
So how does the chain hold up at its first-ever Los Angeles location, which opened two weeks ago in the heart of Koreatown?
Doni Burger sits on the edge of the third floor of Madang Plaza, a modern mini mall built in 2010 and lined with knick knack megastores and Korean versions of Starbucks and Sephora. The vibe is relaxed and friendly, with young people sitting and chatting around the courtyard and small children running up the escalator.
And then there’s Doni Burger. With modern wood-paneled seating, floor-to-ceiling mirrors and flat-screen TVs to display menu options, the setting is much more upscale than your typical burger joint.
Notably, there are no to-go boxes or bags in sight. Doni clearly wants patrons to sit down and enjoy their feasts, which is probably why prices are a bit steeper than some of the joint’s fast food rivals, with a “combo meal” (burger, drink and fries) coming in at just under $10.
Production is streamlined. Employees work in assembly line-like fashion, from the men behind the giant glass windows forming patties to the cashier sliding over your meal instantly after processing the order.
But it’s upon unwrapping the premade burger from its yellow paper packaging that it all starts to fizzle.
Take the “Doniburger,” for example. Topped with lettuce, tomato, mushrooms, American cheese and slathered with steak sauce and pickle relish, this meat-lover’s combination of regular hamburger patty and “Bulgogi” — thin, grilled, marinated slices of beef — is the restaurant’s trademark dish.
It’s your basic burger, but with a bun that’s soft but not toasted, and lettuce that’s not limp but not crunchy, either. All of the ingredients — while concocting an interesting flavor — sort of mix together and ooze out of the burger, especially with the bulgogi, which is stringy and looks none too appetizing.
The rest of the menu is more of the same: heavy on the meat, especially in items such as the Bulgogi burger, which does away with the formality of a regular patty, instead piling on more of the Korean barbecue favorite.
Though Doni does provide a few options for non-meat eaters, such as the assorted nut salad or coleslaw, he fairly assumes that no one would come to his restaurant if they didn’t crave the cow.
The “Pork Katsu Burger” is one of the few items that stands out from the rest, with “katsu” referring to a panko-breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet. The breading is generous and the meat feels warm, crunchy and salty on the tongue, especially with complements of onion and their special mix of sauces.
One might argue, however, that anything tastes good when it’s deep fried. And it’s tough to disagree with that argument.
But as all fast food junkies know, there is only one question left that may just change the game: What about the fries?
The French fries at Doni Burger are lukewarm — probably from sitting on the counter all day waiting for someone to order them — doughy and all one texture, not crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. They aren’t particularly skinny or thick, just sort of the nondescript fries that you eat but don’t really taste.
As for other add-ons such as drinks, Doni provides a basic soda selection (except for, shockingly, water?), and the traditional “cup bingsoo,” a milky, icy blend with red bean that comes in one sweet flavor and might repel customers who aren’t accustomed to the strange contradiction of ingredients. The cup is a play on a traditional Korean dessert of red bean shaved ice made for those on the go.
All in all, Doni Burger is a notch up from the average fast food chain. In the process of fusing Korean and American cuisine, its makers combine savory meats and sauces, and definitely don’t skimp on either of those elements.
At the same time, it doesn’t seem fair to place them in the same bracket as traditional “fast food.” Sure, it’s fast, but the prices aren’t cheap, and it’s not too convenient to take something to go. There’s no drive-thru — it’s just a sit-down restaurant — and when placed in that category of dining, Doni Burger has much stiffer competition, and a long way to go until it meets California standards.

Not many comedians can say that they have multiple websites devoted to bashing them (just Google “Bill Maher Sucks”). Then again, not many comedians have managed to match Bill Maher’s level of spewing socially conscious jokes that speak the truth — no matter how brutally honest it might be.
Keeping it real · Despite having some controversial views, political comedian and talk show host Bill Maher has enjoyed sustained success. – Courtesy of billmaher.com
Maher is known as a staunch liberal; since his days as a stand-up comedian on the New York City club circuit in the late ’70s, Maher has been identifiable by his dry, sarcastic delivery — not to mention a few expletives thrown in here and there. And though many celebrities tend to keep their political beliefs to themselves, Maher has made a career out of sharing his thoughts with the masses. For every loud conservative Glenn Beck yell, Bill Maher is waiting to make a quick-witted liberal jab.
Hyperbolically speaking, college is a time for young students to mold their ideals, ideals that will most likely stay the same for the rest of their lives. For Maher, it was no different.
“[Cornell University] was a great place to learn; and I had some amazing professors, and I do remember having intellectual epiphanies that I wouldn’t have ever had if I didn’t go to Cornell,” Maher said. “[But] socially, it was terrible. It wasn’t a fun place to be: it was cold, there weren’t many girls and I was still kind of finding my way as an awkward adolescent.”
Those intellectual epiphanies would help Maher navigate the tricky road of political commentary later in life. After the New York-born, Jersey-raised funnyman graduated from college, he found himself on the New York City comedy club circuit before branching out into television and film appearances. Soon, however, Maher found his niche with his show Politically Incorrect and currently on Real Time with Bill Maher.
Like his Comedy Central counterparts, Real Time features discussions on pop culture, politics, religion and more. But unlike Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, Maher’s Real Time does not try to stay relatively out of the proverbial partisan loop (not to say that Maher never goes after one of his own liberal kind). Instead of “playing nice” and picking on obvious flubs by political figures, Maher goes in for the kill and attacks anyone — anyone — who warrants a public spanking. And being bipartisan? Forget about it. Maher’s criticism of modern conservatives reaches down to the core.
“I’ve always believed that political beliefs are an outgrowth of moral beliefs and you cannot separate them,” Maher said. “Your politics are your morality.”
Maher usually starts Real Time off with a monologue, followed by an interview and then a panel consisting of everyone from Chris Rock to The Soup’s Joel McHale to Arianna Huffington of the Huffington Post to Lieutenant Governor of California Gavin Newsom. Topics range as well, with discussions on everything from gun control to government spending. One of Maher’s favorite discussions, however, includes the debate on the legalization of marijuana. A longtime advocate of its legalization, Maher is happy that the United States seems to be moving in what he sees as the right direction.
“Colorado and Washington have already legalized it and [President Barack] Obama who was a huge a–hole on this issue in the first administration has lightened up lately,” Maher said. “… Obviously we thought this would happen earlier because all of us remember sitting in the dorm room in the late ’70s and saying, ‘Hey, when we get to be 50 and we’re running the show, of course [marijuana] is gonna be legal.’”
Maher’s barbs against Obama haven’t been isolated occurrences. Though he once supported the Democratic president ardently, Maher has lately been speaking out about how Obama has forgotten about seemingly radical social issues in favor of staying ahead in polls and not rocking the boat too much.
“[Obama] is the Jackie Robinson of American politics,” Maher said. “Being the first black president, he had to be almost perfect.”
Even though Maher wishes that Obama would discontinue the use of many of former President George W. Bush’s antiterror tactics, he recognizes that the current leader had quite a lot to deal with in office.
“[Bush] left a flaming pile of dog sh-t on the White House lawn,” Maher said. “Passing health care, something that every other Big Boy country has, he finally got that through.”
At first, Maher’s witty and brutally honest jargon might feel out of place in the relatively sunny atmosphere of Los Angeles. But according to him, Maher loves the city too much to follow the trend of “b-itching about it.”
Just as brutally honest in real life as he is on television, Maher had no problem saying that “the Yankees are a horrible team who spend more than anyone else and they can go f-ck themselves” (granted, he’s now a minority owner of the Mets) and he thinks that “it’s the nature of youth to be more self-involved and narcissistic.”
But honesty is always Maher’s best policy: it’s how he has separated himself from other, more tame political comedians, and how he has maintained a career that spans decades.
It’s that kind of honesty and sense of humor that allows a young college interviewer to ask a question involving the immature game of “Screw, Marry, Kill” involving conservatives Ann Coulter, Michele Bachmann and Sarah Palin.
“This is tough,” Maher said. “I’d f-ck Sarah Palin, I would marry Ann Coulter as long as we never talk politics [and] I’d kill Michele Bachmann.”
His reasoning?
“Ann Coulter has been a good friend for 20 years, she’s a legitimate friend, and of course, who wouldn’t want to kill Michele Bachmann?” Maher said.
Unguarded, unmuzzled and fiercely intelligent: Maher is certainly here to stay.
 
Bill Maher will speak at the Bovard Auditorium tonight at 8 p.m.

You attribute qualities of truth and honesty to your hero, Maher.  Just because you agree with his politics doesn’t make them true and honest.  Just sayin’.
Ann Coulter is the worst kind of human being. Such hate in her heart. How Bill Maher could be friends with her
is disgusting to me. Hope his comments about her are made only to appease the ultra conservatives who he
wants to add to his audience for ratings.

On Monday afternoon, the Dornsife Center for International Studies hosted Professor Deborah Braütigam of Johns Hopkins University to lead a seminar on the role that China played in acquiring land in Africa.
Scramble for Africa · Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies Professor Deborah Braütigam speaks to students in a presentation titled “‘Feeding Frenzy’: China, Africa and the ‘Great Land Grab.’” – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Braütigam, who currently teaches international development and comparative politics at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins, discussed how, despite conventional wisdom, which holds that the Chinese government and companies have played a large role in African land acquisition, research actually suggests the opposite.
One of the main points that  Braütigam made was that even though there is Chinese interest in acquiring land in Africa, it is often challenging for the Chinese to capitalize upon that interest.
“There is interest, but it’s not as intense as is supposed. It’s not as though the Chinese really want to secure Africa for their food supply,”  Braütigam said. “There are a lot of difficulties in implementing that interest, which is what many investors have found. That doesn’t come into the media, nobody’s reported that or it hasn’t been reported in a very big way.”
In describing how and why Chinese agricultural interests might have manifested in Africa,  Braütigam referenced a familiar American biotechnology company, Monsanto, and the role it play in African agriculture.
“Monsanto in Africa has captured a lot of the hybrid maize market, and Monsanto seeds are sold all over southern Africa,” Braütigam said. “The Chinese would like to do this with rice because they’ve developed hybrid rice. And so they would like to be the Monsanto of rice. Global brands are part of the interest in Africa as a market and a place that’s a global testing ground.”
Attendees of the seminar included undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty members from various schools outside of Dornsife departments and members of the public. Many were fascinated by  Braütigam’s presentation and asked detailed questions in the Q&A session following the talk.
Roshni Ashok, a junior majoring in international relations and economics, was interested in how the land grabbing relates to globalization.
“The most important thing that I took away [from the talk] is how it’s private versus public investment in Africa,” Ashok said. “When people say that investments are being made by a certain state, they could actually mean by a private investor. It’s really entrepreneurial energy and how globalization has kind of thinly veiled states’ actions in terms of what people do.”
Braütigam was invited to USC by Professor Carol Wise. Before joining the School of International Relations at USC in 2002, Wise was a colleague of  Braütigam’s at Johns Hopkins. Wise heard that  Braütigam was speaking at the RAND Corporation, a global policy think tank in Santa Monica, Calif., and invited her to share the same presentation with USC students.
“I think that in terms of our students, there are so many images of China and its activities in the world,” Wise said. “I think it’s really important for them to be exposed to all points of view with regard to A) the rise of China and its influence in the developing countries, and B) its influence in very specific countries in different issue areas.”
Wise believes that it’s important for Americans to learn about China because it is such a fast-growing nation.
“We’re supposedly looking at the next hegemonic state,” Wise said. “China is going to really outpace the U.S. in the size of its economy very soon, and I think we just need to know so much more about it.”

USC’s admission rate for this year’s freshman class was the lowest in its 133-year history at 19.8 percent, according to recently released statistics.
The freshman class is also the most ethnically, geographically and socioeconomically diverse. More than 22 percent of the student body is part of a minority, including 19 percent Asian students, 14 percent Latino students, 6 percent black students and 2 percent Native American and Pacific Islander students.
According to a press release, USC enrolls more underrepresented minority students than most other research universities in the country. Thirteen percent of matriculating students are the first in their families to attend college.
The university received more than 47,300 applications for 2,922 places in the freshman class and had a 33 percent yield rate. The average standardized test scores for the class of 2017 are in the 95th percentile and the average SAT score rose about eight to 10 points, according to Director of Admission Kirk Brennan. The average unweighted GPA of the class was 3.73. Most incoming freshmen were in the top 10 percent of their high school class.
“Our entering freshmen have set new standards of quality and diversity for USC. Each year, we seek to enroll students who bring diverse perspectives and myriad strengths to our student body. We have attracted 2,922 talented young adults who are sure to someday have a profound impact on the world,” Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said in a press release.
About 47 percent of the class is from California, and 33 percent is from Southern California. Approximately 15 percent of the freshman class is made up of international students from 48 different countries, an increase from the previous year.
The new Marshall World Bachelor of Business program, where students spend at least two years abroad, attracted many international students, particularly Italians.
Listed from most to least, Illinois, Texas, New York, Washington and Massachusetts were the states with the largest number of incoming freshmen, aside from California. The countries that contributed the most international students are China, India, Canada, South Korea, Italy and Taiwan.
USC also enrolls more than 4,200 low-income undergraduate students.

SCOMEDY, USC’s comedy group, is bringing Erik Griffin, best known for his role as Montez on the TV show Workaholics, to Tommy’s Place on Tuesday to headline the group’s October show.

USC alumni Jack Michelman and Jim Bonutto founded SCOMEDY in 2011 through their joint production group JIMJAK Entertainment, and will host Tuesday’s show.
“L.A. is one of the most rich and dense areas in the country for comedians, and I would love to keep bringing that to USC,” Michelman said.
Last semester, Michelman and Bonutto successfully produced a show and panel at USC for Comedy Central, which they called the Workaholics Week. The panel was held in Bovard Auditorium and nearly filled the room.
“The panel discussion was really entertaining, and it was cool to get a more personal feeling for the characters I’m familiar with from a TV show,” said Chris Norwood, a junior majoring in geological sciences.
Stand-up comedian Demetri Martin from Comedy Central even made an appearance and delivered never-before performed jokes to the USC audience.
“I thought he was really funny, but I think he thought he wasn’t sure it wasn’t funny. He was self-deprecating,” said Matt Eighmy, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies.
Last year, Michelman and Bonutto brought Bobby Lee of MadTV, Adam Devine, Erik Griffin, Demetri Martin, TJ Miller, Bryan Callen from The Hangover, Dov Davidoff, Iliza Shlesinger, Ben Gleib, Dan Levy, Bret Ernst, Adam Ray from The Heat, Owen Benjamin, Brad Williams and Andrew Santino of Arrested Development fame to perform at USC.
“These were the biggest names in comedy coming to our shows,” Michelman said. “It shocks me to this day on who we got to come — to a free show, mind you.”
Michelman has followed Devine‘s career since he first started performing at comedy clubs. Years later, he found himself working with Devine and inviting him to USC to perform.
Sophomore political science major Alec White attended one of Devine’s shows last semester.
“His jokes were well-suited for a college-aged crowd,” White said. “There were also a couple pop culture references that really worked.”
Part of SCOMEDY’s aim is to develop talent at USC. The openers for performances are composed of USC students who are aspiring comedians and perform their own original jokes.
“They did a great job bringing in two [opening] comedians. The opening act was basically as good as the main comedian,” White said.
Will Getz, a senior double majoring in chemistry and East Asian languages and cultures, was also impressed by the student comedians.
“[The comedy] has a higher degree of reliability because the comedians come from ’SC. [Most student comedians] are of the same general age [as professionals],” Getz said.
Michelman has found different methods to attract an audience to SCOMEDY events, which are all funded by Bonutto and USC Spectrum. One of the ways he advertises the events are through original fliers he hangs around campus.
Admission to the event is free and open to all USC students. SCOMEDY is held the first Tuesday of every month and features professional Los Angeles comedians, as well as some USC student comedians.
The fliers have the logo of SCOMEDY on it with a one-line tease, such as, “It’s almost better than sex,” or, “Harder, better, faster, funnier.”
Michelman also intends to give out free tickets to “The BIG Show LA” at Hollywood Improv.
Though SCOMEDY hosted a lot of big names in the past year, Michelman said he and Bonutto are only just getting started. The pair plans to talk to Comedy Central and bring speakers from the company back for an annual panel of comedians. Another priority of the organization is to start building a USC comedy team.
“I think that SCOMEDY events that provide a healthy way for people to relax and laugh a little are really helpful during what may otherwise be a stressful semester of school work,” Norwood said.
Michelman said he is very passionate about comedy, which fueled his desire to continue working at USC through SCOMEDY after he graduated.
“It is totally a Trojan experience,” he said. “It is one of the most memorable things I’ll have for college -— and I still get to do it.”

In a recently released USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences/Los Angeles Times poll, seven out of 10 voters said they wanted another opportunity to vote on California’s high-speed rail project.
From SoCal to NorCal · The high-speed rail project would connect Southern California with Northern California, linking the two areas through the Central Valley. A one-way trip would cost about $120. – Uracha Chaiyapinunt | Daily Trojan
If the rail is built, the train will be 520 miles long, linking the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles through the Central Valley. Traveling on the train between these cities would cost about $120 one way and would take approximately two hours and 40 minutes.
“Even though it would theoretically take longer than a plane, I usually choose trains over planes because they’re more relaxing and simpler, and you don’t have to get to the station as early as you would if you were taking a plane,” said Anna Skelsey, a freshman majoring in theater.
California has dedicated $9 billion to the $68 billion project  to build the high-speed rail and, according to the poll, 51 percent of voters agreed that the money should be used elsewhere, though 45 percent believed it was well spent. Fifty-two percent believed that the government should stop the bullet train project completely.
Some voters did feel, however, that the high-speed rail could be beneficial to transportation. Sixty-one percent said that a high-speed rail would decrease the amount of traffic on highways and at airports. Sixty-five percent also thought that this project would create new jobs, in contrast to only 32 percent who disagreed.
Voters also answered a question on Tesla founder Elon Musk’s “Hyperloop” plan. According to Musk, the Hyperloop would consist of pressurized capsules being driven though a tube by electric motors.
About 75 percent of voters claimed to know “little or nothing” about the Hyperloop, compared to 26 percent who claimed to know “a lot or some” about it.
Fifty-five percent of voters said they would take the Hyperloop over any other mode of transportation, though 13 percent said they would rather take a high-speed train. In contrast to the high-speed rail, Musk claims that the Hyperloop would cost $20 for a one-way, 30-minute trip between San Francisco and Los Angeles.
“I like being able to see nature and various other sites when I’m in a train,” said Pedraam Mirzanian, an undecided freshman. “You don’t get that if you’re in a plane or if you’re going really fast in a Hyperloop.”
The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times Poll was conducted between Sept. 18 and 24. It polled 1,500 registered California voters.

The guy promoting the hyperloop concept owns a car company.  I think he would rather you buy one of his cars than a high speed rail train ticket.
The Hyperloop is an exciting idea but doesn’t fix any of the current transportation issues facing the world today. Our BiModal Glideway would provide the same high speed travel while offering the freedom of a door to door commute, without the need to change trains, busses or leaving your car in an overcrowded, limited security parking station where it can be struck, broken into and possibly stolen.

Both the USC men’s and women’s tennis teams got off to a hot start this weekend and will look to continue their winning ways this week at the ITA All-American Championships.
Stellar · Junior Jonny Wang (above) and sophomore Max de Vroome won their first-round doubles match at the ITA All-American Championships. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
The women’s team sent a few players to the Cal Nike Invitational in Berkeley, Calif., while some stayed in Los Angeles to play in the prequalifying rounds of the ITA/Riviera All-American Championships.
Freshman Zoë Katz and senior transfer Brynn Boren were both victorious in their debuts for USC, each reaching the quarterfinals at the Cal Nike Invitational.
Junior Gabriella DeSimone fell in the first round, while sophomore Ellie Yates fell in the Round of 16.
Katz and Yates teamed up in doubles, as did Boren and DeSimone, and both teams advanced to the quarterfinals of the tournament.
Back in Westwood, junior Giuliana Olmos and senior Kaitlyn Christian advanced to the second round of prequalifying singles for the ITA/Riviera All-American Championships, which start this week.
The main draw is set to begin Thursday in Pacific Palisades, Calif. Junior Sabrina Santamaria, the top-ranked women’s singles player in the nation, enters as the favorite to win the tournament. Last year, Santamaria entered the tournament as the No. 5 seed and fell in the second round to now-teammate Boren, who then played for Tennessee.
Boren and junior Zoë Scandalis are listed as alternates at the ITA/Riviera All-American Championships. Both will compete in qualifying rounds if not selected from the alternates list for the main draw. DeSimone will also play in the qualifiers.
In women’s doubles, Christian and Santamaria, last year’s NCAA women’s doubles champions, will play to win in the main draw.
On the men’s side, the team also played well in the opening round of the ITA All-American Championships in Tulsa, Okla.
Four Trojans fought their way through their first qualifying matches on Monday. Senior Michael Grant was the first to punch his ticket to the next qualifying round. His success was mirrored by junior Jonny Wang and sophomore Max de Vroome, both of whom also won their first-round qualifying matches.
Out of 128 qualifiers, eight players will make it into the main draw, which begins Thursday.
Three Trojans are already set to play in the main draw: senior Ray Sarmiento and juniors Roberto Quiroz and Yannick Hanfmann. Sarmiento, who was forced to pull out of last year’s ITA All-American quarterfinals with a calf injury, enters the season at a career-high No. 8 in the country.
Wang and de Vroome will compete together in the doubles qualifiers, while Hanfmann and Johnson are listed as alternates for the main draw.
The talented men’s and women’s teams aim for success in their first big tournaments of the year, which will surely set the tone for the rest of their respective seasons.

It ended with a whimper, not a bang.
The Lane Kiffin era at USC finally, mercifully, came to an end in the wee hours of Sunday morning, providing a jolting wake-up call for most Trojan fans who stayed up late the night before watching their team get blitzed by Arizona State in a 62-41 defeat.
The resolution to the most talked about coaching hot seat of the year was two hours old before most people even knew about it.
When all is said and done, Kiffin’s record at USC will forever stand at 28-15, with seven losses in his past 11 games and zero bowl game victories. But the numbers don’t come anywhere close to telling the entire story.
Kiffin inherited a program in shambles. USC fans don’t like to think of their team this way, but that’s exactly what it was in the process of becoming when Kiffin took over. The bowl ban cost the team a chance at the Rose Bowl in 2011, sure, but the loss of 30 scholarships was by far the most crippling aspect of the sanctions levied by the NCAA in 2010.
Take the ASU game, for example. When two wide receivers went down with injuries, Kiffin was forced to play walk-on redshirt freshman Robby Kolanz in the second half of a meaningful Pac-12 game. This is just one instance of a dire situation, but it illustrates how much the scholarship losses put this roster behind the eight ball.
Given the adverse conditions Kiffin was forced to deal with, 28-15 actually does not sound that bad. Consider that from 2002-04, while facing a two-year bowl ban and loss of 21 scholarships over three seasons, Alabama went 20-18, with the lack of depth on its roster being a key factor in its struggles. When the NCAA hits you with some of the harshest penalties in college football history, it doesn’t want you to succeed.
But that wasn’t the only hindrance Kiffin had to overcome upon his arrival in Los Angeles. Rightly or wrongly, deserved or undeserved, Kiffin came to Troy with a bad reputation. To be blunt, it was easy for people to dislike him. He shot his mouth off at Tennessee, didn’t schmooze the L.A. media and was perceived as someone who “failed up” throughout his career, consistently receiving marquee coaching jobs without ever having succeeded at his last stop.
It was always an uphill battle for Kiffin to win the hearts of the locals. The 2011 season, in which the Trojans went 10-2 and finished ranked No. 6 in the AP Poll, helped win some support, but the reviews were anything but unanimous. Then the 2012 season happened, which can only be described as an unmitigated disaster, and the approval ratings, again, tanked. His short leash grew even shorter in 2013, eventually resulting in the plug being pulled just five games into this season.
During his time here, the criticism came in all shapes and sizes. A lot of it was definitely warranted. The ball deflating, jersey switching, coaches’ poll voting and media ditching were all self-inflicted wounds that could have been avoided. Kiffin’s playcalling was also constantly criticized — though I’m not sure if the disapproval of fans that know next to nothing about football can be taken too seriously.
Other barbs thrown Kiffin’s way, though, don’t hold water. Many pointed to his stoicism and lack of enthusiasm on the sidelines as evidence that he didn’t connect with his players or was unable to provide inspiration to them. Kiffin has pointed out before that he keeps his  fist-pumping to a minimum so that he remains focused on the next play, and he stands far from the line of scrimmage, and away from people on the sidelines, to get a better angle at the field, not because he can’t connect with the players.
Athletic Director Pat Haden and USC players who have spoken to the media in the wake of Kiffin’s dismissal have nothing but good things to say about their former coach. A skeptic might chalk this up to political correctness, but I will just take them for their word and believe that Kiffin had his players’ respect and loyalty.
As for his sideline demeanor, I guess judgment on that is based on results. If USC won, then Kiffin was praised for his      laser-like focus. Against Oregon in Autzen Stadium in 2011, with the crowd going crazy and the Ducks mounting a comeback, he was a calming presence amid the chaos that helped the team hold on for the upset victory.
But in a loss, critics called him boring: He lacks enthusiasm, he can’t inspire his players, and his dispassionate ways have a negative impact on the team. When things got out of hand in the third quarter against ASU, he looked confused and couldn’t take control of the situation, killing any chance the Trojans had of winning.
Thus is the nature of coaching at USC. Expectations are high, sometimes unreasonably so, and Kiffin knew that when he took the job. It’s the reason he made a reported $4 million annually — to win, no matter the circumstances.
It’s a harsh reality, but it’s the reality nonetheless. Fans might not have liked what the program did under Kiffin’s lead, but really, he was destined to fail all along. Given the burden he had to bear, he deserves some praise for how much he succeeded. If he had been given a better chance to begin with, who knows how far the Trojans could have gone with Lane Kiffin as their leading man.

I think you both are missing several points!  Consistency and growth?  This is the game of football.  It can be different week in and week out year after year.  You have different players all the time depending on injuries, freshman quarterbacks, new defensive coach, etc.  The week before they played well.  The week after?  Horrible.  Maybe the other team was better than the one the week before? Don’t say Kiffin isn’t showing signs of improvement….say his team does not seem to be performing well.  I don’t think coaches expect so many said penalties or for their running back to be out so long but hey, that’s the game of football  If it were just up to the coaches, film and X’s and O’s, more teams would be winning but there are young mean in there who make mistakes and try to learn from them.  I don’t think Lane called the play where the freshman quarterback was going to throw to the other team.  There are many, many coaches who didn’t do well right off the bat and they had much less to deal with than Coach Kiffin.  And I’m sorry, I must have missed the article that said before the game, Lane was out there deflating balls.  Yeah right!  Don’t believe everything you read – try to have some facts to back things up.  The years of a USC or Nebraska or Alabama having one coach for a long era is over.  No university is patient enough to work through injuries, sanctions, new coaching staff/plays, etc.  You win or you’re gone.  That’s why I don’t feel sorry for Tennessee.  You don’t think if Coach Kiffin lost his first year or two there he would be gone?  Of course he would.  There is no loyalty at universities anymore.  IT’s not even the athletic director handling things….now a President goes on Football Road trips?  Does he have a university to run?  That tells you what entity is much more powerful!!!!
I live in Atlanta, Ga.
It truly amazes me that the scoundrel Coach Pete Carroll is never talked about. (Talk about a “free-pass”)
Carroll got USC in trouble with the NCAA and then moves on to Seattle.
Coach Lane Kiffin stinks but Coach Pete Carroll deserves to be whipped on the USC campus.
Unless I have missed some comments…this dirtbag ran out on the Trojans !
My only complaint is that Pat Haden should also have been fired.  Haden, for all of his reported success, has so far failed at USC by not firing Kiffin on day one of his AD job.  Haden simply lacks the fortitude or courage to act swiftly; he was much too dilatory and passive in his handling of the fiasco that defined Lane Kiffin.  Kiffin was way over his head to begin with, and dragging USC through the NCAA appeal process (a colossal mistake, IMO), demonstrates just how incompetent the very top USC leaders are (including Nikias, Todd Dickey and others who were also part of the NCAA “lack of institutional control” cast of characters).  Until USC truly cleans house, the problems with NCAA violations — which happen every other decade or so — will recur.
Nick,
I usually agree with your opinions, but no disrespect, you are a little bit off on this one. 
I agree that kiffins personality can be spun as a positive or a negative depending on whether or not SC is winning, but you said it yourself – he was paid $4 million to win, regardless  of the circumstances, and he didn’t. 
Throw in all of the other issues (deflating footballs, jersey numbers, embarrassingly not showing up to the sun bowl dinner, etc…) and there is a clear disconnect / lack of leadership that just adds to the not being able to win. 
Kiffin era was a complete fail, and he deserves to be shown the door
Tommy T, I think you are a little off on this one.  Not everything that happens at USC is Lane Kiffin’s fault.  Most of what you read in the paper is a writer’s opinion and usually not based on any sort of fact.  Fans at USC are letting the media fuel the fire which happens here in Nebraska as well.  There were reasons for the Sun Bowl dinner if you would have read facts from a reputable source, no one knows about the deflating footballs (and who cares) but I think Coach Kiffin is a little busy to be worry about deflated footballs before a game.   He wanted a challenge (Knew some sanctions were coming to USC), he loved USC and honestly with the sanctions, not a lot of coaches knocking down their door.  Why?  Because while they want a challenge probably not one that large.  He does have plenty of years of experience coaching as well as leadership skills which the Captains mentioned in Pat Hayden’s press conference.  Unfortunately, kids that are between the ages of 18-21 make mistakes and at times, they don’t play well and every once in awhile, they will lose!  Sometimes, they lose to better teams – doesn’t mean the coach needs to be fired.  Sometimes your quarterback will throw 4 interceptions, sometimes your great running back is hurt, sometimes their line is better than your line.  Sometimes, for whatever reason, your kicker misses a chip shot field goal.  That is the game of football….many games of football every weekend and you see bad teams beat good teams all the time.  You see underdogs win.  What is sad to see is that USC has poor fans and a poor student section and if they are losing, they are NOT going to be behind their players or coach.  I can guarantee you all the players and all the coaches work extremely hard every week and their goal is to win.  Sometimes they do and sometimes they don’t.  Coaching is a brutal profession and we find a great coach once for 10-2 because we wanted to be number one and we wanted to play for the National Championship every year so we fired our coach we loved and he left.  It’s been a mess ever since.  Bottom line is Lane Kiffin worked his butt off to help USC for years and it is a sad day in this world when you treat your Coach who is getting home at 3:00 in the morning the way Pat Hayden treated him.  If I were the players at USC, it shows me that there isn’t much loyalty or respect starting at the very top!!  That’s where there is a clear disconnect.  I don’t see USC going much of anywhere with Pat Hayden treating people that way.
Now we can only hope to lure Pat Fitzgerald from Northwestern or Herm Edwards from ESPN studios.
Fight On!
Agree ^. 
The players, Haden, etc…. Are all at fault here. 
But the guy lost 7/11 games – what “success” do you mean?
We get it, nick, it’s not all kiffins fault. 
But you talk if praising Kiffin for his success? That is overkill. 
Prove your point and be done – don’t push it
Nick,
Seriously? If I didn’t know better I would say you are Kiffen’s son! Some of your comments are crazy! Your shot at fans “who know next to nothing about football”…really? Kiffen’s play calling was some of the worst I have ever seen! When my 9 year old son calls the play before the ball is even snapped I would say there is a problem. His lack of enthusiasm I can partially agree with you, but at the end of the day he was the Head Coach of The University of Southern California!! You also need to remember that the 2011 season he had Carol’s players, this season even with lack of scholarships, he had a top recruiting class and you saw the results! So your comment about “destined to fail” again is off base.  Kiffen is a horrible head coach and this was the best thing for the program.
Sean,
Wow, your 9-year old son calls the play before the ball is even snapped? That is simply amazing. What a prodigy you have on your hands! You must be so proud. As far as the writer’s statement in which you took offense—“…not sure if the disapproval of fans that know next to nothing about football can be taken too seriously”—tell me this:  What were the two most common formations used by ASU’s offense? Also, what kind of defense did USC line up in to combat ASU’s favorite tendencies? What was Taylor Kelly reading when the Trojans dropped into two deep coverage? Can you answer any of those questions? Do you even understand them? I didn’t think so. In that case, Sean, the writer is referring to you when he comments on the fans that “know next to nothing about football.” Hey, but at least you can rejoice in the fact that your genius 9-year old son can call the plays before the ball is even snapped.
Well-written and accurate.  Lane Kiffin well-knew what he was stepping into when he took the job, and the sanctions cat was well out of the bag.  I mean, if I could spot it, then anyone could.  So Garrett had Kiffin in his sights because they got along well and Kiffin’s SC record, where he could hide from the public, was solid.  He hired the man as what, a willing target with guts?  There were times when SC looked incredible under Kiffin and he let the guys play ball.  It was in the losses that he seemed most immobilized.  It was that frozen statue in the hoodie at El Paso that lost me.
I think your article misses one relevant point in all this; and, that is consistency and growth. I agree with AD Pat Haden in his assertion that Kiffin was not showing any signs of improvement. I think Kiffin reached his plateau. The only things I can’t get out of my head are the deflated balls and switched jerseys. I think that when you use techniques as these it either speaks to one’s lack of professional ability or you don’t have faith in your team. I think that is something worth delving into.

Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu has continued an impressive start to her USC career this week, as she received her second Pac-12 Freshman of the Week award.
Up to the challenge · Freshman outside hitter Ebony Nwanebu has 122 kills on the season, ranking second on the team in that category. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
Her outstanding play in USC’s 3-1 victory against crosstown rival UCLA on Wednesday kicked off a great week. Posting 17 kills in 31 attempts, Nwanebu displayed her powerful and accurate hitting ability. The freshman standout’s versatility was also on display, as she added two blocks and one dig, leading the team in scoring with 18 points.
Nwanebu built on the performance against the Bruins with a solid effort in a road win against the Utah Utes. She contributed nine kills in a decisive 3-0 victory for the Trojans, bringing her week total to 26 kills with an astounding hitting percentage of .417 from the right side. On the season, Nwanebu has averaged 2.98 kills per set, good for second-best on the team.
The most recent honor adds to the trophy case for this year’s freshman class, with Nwanebu receiving the award in the first week of the season and fellow outside hitter Elise Ruddins winning it the week prior.
The two have combined to almost match the output of sophomore outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who was selected as the Freshman of the Week five times last year.
Overall, the USC women’s volleyball team has won the award eight times in the three years that the conference has selected individual awards. To earn playing time as a freshman at a perennial powerhouse such as USC is impressive alone, but to dominate against a rival and play tough on the road forecasts a bright future for the young outside hitter.
Nwanebu and the rest of the second-ranked Women of Troy (12-1, 2-0 Pac-12) are back at the Galen Center this weekend to take on Stanford on Friday at  8 p.m. and California on Sunday at 1 p.m.

The USC women’s soccer team looked to begin Pac-12 play on a high note, competing in a hard-fought contest against Arizona State. Unfortunately, a goal in the final minute of regulation gave the Sun Devils a 1-0 win over the Women of Troy on Sunday.
Stumbling · Freshman forward/midfielder Kayla Mills (18) and the rest of the USC attack was unable to break through for a goal against ASU. Mills has a team-leading 11 points on the season for the Women of Troy. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
USC (5-4-1, 0-1-0 Pac-12) and ASU (6-3-1, 1-0 Pac-12) engaged in a rough, defensive match, with both teams pushing for the early advantage. ASU came the closest to scoring in the first half in the 19th minute, attempting two shots in a span of 10 seconds, but both of them hit the post.
The first half favored the Sun Devils, who outshot USC 12-4 (5-3 on goal). The teams combined for 15 shots in the first 32 minutes before a 13-minute lull in the action kept both teams from getting a shot, until ASU’s Blair Alderson got a shot on goal against junior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley to close the half.
The second half featured more of the same, with USC pushing the pace and trying to generate more scoring opportunities. The strategy worked, with USC out-shooting ASU 9-4 in the second half.
Neither team, however, appeared to be able to put a shot on goal, making it look like the game was headed to overtime. A header from sophomore defender Marlee Carrillo in the 87th minute appeared to be USC’s best chance, but the deflection off of the goalie was off the mark and went wide left.
Just when it looked like the game would be headed into overtime, ASU’s Devin Marshall managed to get the ball on a fastbreak, putting it past Stanley with 19 seconds left to give the Sun Devils the win.
“Unfortunately, instead of playing at our standard, we played at ASU’s standard,” sophomore midfielder Jamie Fink said. “We did some good things in the final third, but we need to improve on just playing our game and sticking to our game plan rather than stooping down to our opponents.”
Opening up conference play with a loss is not an ideal way to begin the Pac-12 season, but Fink asserted that she and her teammates would be able to learn from their mistakes in the ASU match and rebound quickly in the coming weeks.
“This game was taken as a lesson,” Fink said. “We are picking our heads up, learning from our mistakes and moving forward as we play Washington and Washington State this weekend. The team is remaining positive, and we are ready to attack our games this weekend.”
Stanley finished with five saves on six shots for the Women of Troy. Junior midfielder Alex Quincey led the scoring attack for USC with three shots, while Carrillo, senior midfielder Jordan Marada and Fink each had two shots total and one shot on goal.
Marshall provided ASU’s only goal, giving her six on the season. ASU forward Cali Farquharson led the team with four shots, while Chandler Morris earned three saves.
The contest maintained a high intensity throughout, with a combined 31 fouls between the two teams (USC 17, ASU 14). The Sun Devils also earned two yellow cards: Jasmine Roth in the 74th minute and Marshall in the 90th minute, just before her game-winning goal.
Each of USC’s four losses have been one-goal defeats. The Women of Troy’s goal differential on the season is plus-10, which ranks No. 8 in the Pac-12.
The biggest reason USC has struggled of late is because of its defense. The team’s 11 goals allowed is second-worst of all conference teams, though its 21 goals scored is tied for No. 3 in the Pac-12.
USC hopes to get back on track at McAlister Field next weekend, as they prepare to take on Washington on Friday at 2 p.m. and Washington State on Sunday 6 at 3 p.m. They will then travel north the following weekend to face California on Oct. 11 at 3 p.m. and No. 2 Stanford on Oct. 13 at 5 p.m.
With 11 conference games remaining on the schedule, USC is still very much in the hunt for the Pac-12 crown. But improvement needs to be made in all aspects of the team’s play in order for the Women of Troy to reach their goal ultimate goal of a conference championship, something the players are well aware of.
“One of the main positives that we took out of Sunday’s loss was that this game was early in our conference play, so we can refer to it for learning purposes,” sophomore defender Erin Owen said. “This game will also act as our motivation for the remainder of the season. This week we are focusing on putting in second and third efforts when we have just won the ball so we can eliminate any counterattacks from the other team.”

As temperatures cool down, and the first of fall breezes make their way across campus, some freshmen have more reason than most to be excited about the change in weather. It stands in stark contrast to the temperatures of the first month of school, when the thermometer rarely dipped below 90 degrees. This wouldn’t necessarily be a problem but for one thing: For every freshman who chooses dorm-style living, there is no air conditioning in the rooms of Birnkrant, New and North Residential Colleges, Pardee and Marks Towers. USC housing must address this issue immediately to alleviate stress and increase student comfort.
Victoria Cuthbertson | Daily Trojan
 
When students are trying to acclimate to a new environment, comfort is a crucial factor for their happiness. Undecided freshman Siena Silver, who lives in Birnkrant, said there have been nights where she has been kept awake by the sweltering temperatures.
“The heat keeps us up late at night because we’re not comfortable enough to fall asleep,” Silver said. “People actually slept in the lobby downstairs for several nights on end because it was too hot to be in the rooms.”
A university that allows its students to sleep on the floors of a lobby does not make the best impression upon its student body — especially when room and board comes at such a high cost. Furthermore, without that comfort level, students lose sleep, which in turn affects their academics and productivity during the day. The issue of sleep is an issue of academic success, which is crucial when beginning a new school. Our university cannot expect students to realize their full potential when they are not well-rested.
Freshman Jessica Fischer, a communications major who lives in Pardee Tower, said that she felt the lack of air conditioning in her dorm room hurt her academic performance.
“I don’t like to complain, but the level of discomfort is just not fair,” Fischer said. “It has severely affected my sleep cycle and made me less productive during the day, hurting my academic success.”
If USC truly values students’ academic experiences, then this is an issue that cannot be ignored. The temperatures, which rarely fell below 85 degrees at night for the first few weeks of the fall semester, have a negative effect on freshmen living in dorms.
“Without air conditioning, I could never sleep, and it really did hamper my performance as a student,” freshman Birnkrant resident Jeff Levine said. “I wish I could study in my room and be more productive, but with the heat I just can’t.”
The lack of air conditioning basically sends a message to all incoming freshmen: They must choose between comfort or dorm-style living. Though air conditioned suite-style living is a great option for many, all students should be given the fair choice of living in the traditional college hall. No air conditioning means that many students immediately discount that option, losing out on an experience that could vastly enrich their time at USC.
Emily Huang, a resident advisor for Birnkrant, echoed these sentiments.
“One of the worst parts of being an RA in the first few weeks was seeing the new residents have to sleep downstairs in the lobby because they couldn’t sleep, and couldn’t do their work,” Huang said. “That was definitely detrimental to their studying and academic life so early into the semester.”
Huang said there is something very special about living in a dorm setting freshman year, and that shouldn’t be overlooked.
“It does seem to give students a sense of inequality, because there are other buildings for freshmen that do have air conditioning,” Huang said. “I feel like suites tend to not foster the sense of community that dorms can, so students miss out on that experience. There’s air conditioning on the first floor, so why can’t they have it on the rest? The school has money, they just need to direct it toward student living.”
One solution to this is if the housing system won’t let students have air conditioning, then they should be allowed to install  smaller, portable systems themselves.
“There are other residence halls on campus that do have it, and I can’t seem to comprehend why we can’t have it as well,” said freshman international relations major Ora Rosenbaum, who lives in Marks Tower. “If USC won’t do that for us, at least let us install our own units if we want them.”
It is imperative that USC resolve this issue. With so many freshmen subject to the 85-degree weather and no air conditioning, which affects habits ranging from sleep to stress to academics, it simply cannot be ignored. It is USC’s responsibility to its students to resolve this issue for the happiness and success of them all.

Heat doesn’t build character. It builds laziness and inability to focus.
This is becoming an all too frequent problem for colleges. It’s such a shame because students spend so much money on their education and to live on campus and then they are too hot to focus on their studies or even sleep in their dorms. Colleges should all have good air conditioning on campus and they should schedule routine air conditioning maintenance to ensure that the temperature on campus is made as comfortable as possible.
If you want housing with AC – why didn’t you go get one? There are plenty of off campus housing that has what you want – you just have to pay for it. 
Welcome to Obama-Nation. Self entitled whiners with a bunch of demands with very little appreciation of what they have and no concept of earning to purchase what more they wish to have. 
If you weenies are having a hard time sleeping with air – that just means you have been coddled WAY to long in Mommy’s house.
This article makes it seem like students have been suffering forever. As someone who lived in New North my freshman year, it was not an unbearable heat. The university allows and encourages box fans for students, which greatly increase comfort. There were very few times when my dorm rooms as unbearably hot: during the heat wave in 2011 (when even people in a/c buildings were uncomfortable), and when my fan broke in early spring. Grow up, quit complaining, and buy a fan.
This sweltering heat and lack of a/c in the dorms is hardest on the LGBT community
Don’t forget about Trojan Hall- for me it was the mustiest, most heat-absorbent building I’d ever stayed in.
To the SC Mom, maybe take into consideration that rather than giving all students what they really need like a/c, funds are being diverted toward keeping your son and his “brothers” drunk and partying 3 nights a week. How wholesome.
We have A/C at Pike.

Heat builds character.  Lots of you young people lack character.

Last week, the Los Angeles Unified School District launched its $1 billion tablet initiative in an effort to give an iPad to every student in the district, according to the Los Angeles Times. But no more than a week later, last Tuesday, almost 200 of the district’s high school students who received iPads — namely students at Roosevelt High School — had found a way to hack through software website blocks.
This early setback is a sign that the entire idea of the iPad as a facilitative educational device is a big financial waste. Not only is this an issue because the iPad is widely viewed as an entertainment gadget, but also because this technology cannot compare to traditional teaching methods.
According to the Times, the iPad rollout has three phases. It’s only in its first phase, which is a goal to distribute more than 600,000 devices. But after students hacked the system to freely surf the web, LAUSD halted home use of the iPads. Though district officials are taking strides to correct the problems, none of the methods constitute long-term solutions. For one, recalling the device sounds good, but there are also problems regarding responsibility left unanswered.
What happens if the iPads are damaged or stolen? Who repairs or replaces them? How much will it cost and who will pay? Moreover, the district doesn’t seem to be acting on solid statistical data that demonstrates a real correlation between iPad use and test scores or educational progress. Instead of distributing all 600,000 devices in the next few years, the district should have done a trial run with just a few classrooms.
Furthermore, advances in technology do not always need to be incorporated into curriculum, as they do not necessarily help improve teaching methods. In fact, they could become more distracting to the kids.
According to NPR, the Roosevelt students explained that the trick is to delete personal profile information to open up freedom to surf, send tweets, socialize on Facebook and stream music on Pandora.
Renee Hobbs of the Media Education Lab at the University of Rhode Island told the Times, “They were bound to fail … Children are growing up today [with] the iPad used as a device for entertainment. So when the iPad comes into the classroom, then there’s a shift in everybody’s thinking.”
The students’ attitudes toward the iPad are at the root of the chaos. Sure, iPads have the ability to run simulations and models, accommodate students with vision impairment, provide educational materials for English learners, create new ways for teachers to monitor progress more efficiently and a litany of other advantages. But they also have Candy Crush and Temple Run, access to YouTube videos and Facebook, which aren’t necessarily great educational tools.
In the digital age, it is undeniable that tech competency is important, but too much reliance on technology, such as the iPad, could lead to children devaluing the presence of paper and pencil. New technology is updated and outdated in a flash, but a book doesn’t change overnight — there’s a reason why we’ve been using it for thousands of years. Nothing is wrong with the old textbook, pencil and paper.
There are also many more tech options to choose from if the district really wants to upgrade — alternatives such as SmartBoards and podcasts that will not rely on a device with so many entertainment apps. The focus of a $30 million deal with Apple should be educational guidance and supervision from college students nearby, volunteer mentors who will foster a love of learning on a personal level with every student. Now that’s a worthy cause to replace the personal relationship with a device marketed primarily as an entertainment tool.

On the other hand, some schools have achieved a successful transition into a more engaging educational environment. Some students are finding greater depth in subject material and expanding their knowledge beyond what has been presented. Some teachers have been able to fine-tune coursework to make the material more relevent and include current resources and events. An iPad can be a toy or a tool. That fact does not eliminate its potential in the classroom or the workplace. The same can be said for a sheet of paper. The district has some work to do before teachers and students can get past the iPad as a distraction. Don’t abandon the effort. The status quo is not working. The status quo keeps many LA students at a disadvantage when entering the workforce or attempting to continue on to higher education. Technology is a powerful tool, in the right hands, virtually required for success at USC. Our discussion should be focused on the best way to rapidly implement technology, not to complain as glitches are revealed.
I think this one is a case of the students teaching the teachers
Valerie, 
I think you are missing an important aspect of the story. The rulers have plans, and the ruled have their own plans. School board members have their vision of granting $$$ to their favored vendors (like Apple) and plan for the expenditure to further the education of students. The students have their own plans and they are ultimately responsible for their own education. It only took one student to defeat the lock and the entire student body may benefit from that determination.
School boards can change the tools, but the students themselves will only learn what they wish to learn. Power belongs to individuals. We are agents to ourselves. We are free to choose.

Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a man of many roles. Whether as a cold edged cop in The Dark Knight Rises, a cancer survivor in 50/50, or a deeply analytical extractor in Inception, Gordon-Levitt injects a deep sense of depth into his characters that is unprecedented. With the release of his latest film, Don Jon, Gordon-Levitt marks the latest milestone in his career, having written and directed the film in addition to playing the title character. Gordon-Levitt’s all-star cast delivers a spectacular performance that is sure to leave audiences questioning one of society’s most prevalent, but under-discussed topics.
Jon Martello (Gordon-Levitt) is a good old Jersey boy who loves his family, his church, and … his porn. Although he is a smooth-talking ladies’ man, his love for women takes a backseat to his insatiable desire for the world of fake sex on screen.
 
Joseph Gordon-Levitt (left) and Scarlett Johansson (right) star in Levitt’s debut written and directed feature film Don Jon, a story of a wholesome Jersey boy who juggles unrealistic expectations from his addiction to porn and maintaining a relationship with his true love | Courtesy of fix-z.com.
That all changes when Jon meets the unluckily named Barbara Sugarman (Scarlett Johansson). When Barbara catches Jon enjoying his favorite hobby, he realizes that his lifestyle is, for all intents and purposes, unsustainable. As he falls deeper into love but refuses to fall out of his porn habits, his addiction threatens to bring down his relationship with Barbara, a down-to-earth girl who likes romantic chick flicks and dreams of finding a Prince Charming.
With the exception of a barrage of porn compilations interspersed with Jon’s actual encounters with women, the movie appears to develop into a romantic comedy consistent with the tropes audiences have come to know and love from Hollywood. Gordon-Levitt intends to shatter that notion even faster than his on-screen personality can shatter his love for his right hand. Enter Esther (Julianne Moore), an eccentric student in Jon’s night class. True to form, Esther also catches Jon watching porn during class. Unlike Barbara, Esther is fascinated. Needless to say, this lays an awkward foundation for what develops into a hilarious contrast between the two women’s feelings toward pornography. This dynamic propels the movie toward a conclusion that is emotionally moving, but anticlimactic.
One of the goals in making the film, Gordon-Levitt said, was to highlight the place of pornography in society and to criticize its undeniable presence as a booming industry in America.
“I wanted to compare pornography to the rest of our media, even perfectly mainstream stuff,” he said. “That’s what I wanted to talk about, and sorta make fun of.”
It is an undoubtedly bold strategy. It is easy to imagine furious pre-production meetings between cast and crew spent discussing how best to thrust (no pun intended) the presence of pornography in the audience’s face in a way that criticizes it rather than idolizes it. This goal of the film is a success — partly due to the creepy narration from Jon that overlays most of his porn-watching scenes, and partly due to the emotions evoked by Johansson’s masterful performance as Jon’s respectable girlfriend.
Gordon-Levitt’s style as a director also makes the film’s critique of pornography effective. Through creative screenplay that builds patterns and repetitive scenes into Jon’s life, the audience is able to grasp the addicting and negative impact that Jon’s habit has on his relationships. Like a ritual, the camera captures the most mundane aspects of Jon’s week in addition to his porn addiction to create a contrast. The plot also constructs itself around this repetition — meaning that the framework for each scene is the same, with only the dialogue (and fortunately the actor’s clothes) changed.
The most telling sign of Gordon-Levitt’s proficiency as a director is his ability to engage in a subtle criticism that is foregrounded by an absurdly hilarious sequence of events. In other words, Gordon Levitt is careful not to take things too seriously in a film that could easily be appropriated as another old-fashioned and conservative tirade against porn. The film’s greatest strength is the overkill presentation of the pornography, combined with Gordon-Levitt’s creepy fascinations and narratives. Is it awkward to watch? Yes. Does Gordon-Levitt care? No.
The talent of the cast more than compensates for the at times awkward cinematography. Gordon-Levitt, Johansson and Moore are able to turn the ordinarily stock characters of a romance film into much more complex and intriguing figures. The performance of Moore is particularly remarkable for her evolution from a quirky woman in Jon’s night school class to a grieving, wise figure that ultimately gives the film its most important sense of meaning. Moore’s portrayal of Esther overcomes the film’s various hiccups, but most importantly, it makes the film worth watching.
