Sadie Edwards was unstoppable today, making lay-ups, forcing turnovers, and hitting 3-pointers as the Women of Troy cruised to a 70-59 victory over host Utah on the road Friday night.
The sophomore guard led all scorers with a season-high 24 points to go along with four steals and a pair of blocks.
“I was just aggressive from the start. I didn’t settle for jump-shots,” Edwards said. “I tried to get a lot of things going to the rim and put pressure on the defense.”
Teammate Kristen Simon also had a great game, finishing with 12 points and 10 rebounds, including a key lay-up with 1:43 remaining to seal the victory for USC (16-5, 4-5). Star transfer Temi Fagbenle finished with eight points and 12 rebounds.
Both teams started off the game struggling to make baskets, however, both teams eventually hit their stride in a close first quarter in which no team held a lead larger than three. USC was able to extend the lead to six in the second quarter on a jumper by Edwards but Utah (12-8, 4-5) immediately countered with an 8-0 run to take a 31-29 lead.
It seemed like the Utes would end the half with a slim lead but Sadie Edwards used a step-back to shake her defender and hit a three to beat the buzzer, giving USC a 39-37 lead going into the half.
After trading baskets to start the second half, the Trojans were able to pull away in the second half with a 10-0 run to take a 56-43 lead. It seemed like the Women of Troy would cruise to a victory from there, but Utah went on an 8-0 run following a tough jumper by Edwards to cut the USC lead to just 61-57 with six minutes remaining in the game. Redshirt junior Alexis Lloyd was able to stop the bleeding with an and-1 layup and Trojans never looked back.
USC was the far more aggressive team on both ends of the floor Friday and the box score reflected this as the Women of Troy finished with more rebounds, steals, blocks, and free-throw attempts.
“We put a lot of pressure on their guards and their bigs by attacking the rim, offensive rebounding, and taking advantage of every opportunity we had to get the ball and just getting easier looks,” Edwards said.
Utah’s Malia Nawahine led the Utes with 14 points and fellow teammate Paige Crozon finished with 12 points and six rebounds. Star player Emily Potter, had 10 points but fouled out with seven minutes remaining in the game.
USC was again missing Jordan Adams and Brianna Barrett for the fifth consecutive game due to ineligibility. With the win, the Trojans move up into a tie for sixth in the Pac-12. The Pac-12 is arguably the toughest conference in the nation right now, currently ranking first in RPI.
USC hits the road again Sunday to play against Colorado, which is coming off an 82-64 loss to UCLA. Colorado has yet to win a game in conference play.

I haven’t done the math, but I’m almost positive that I’ve spent more time in the Daily Trojan newsroom than in my own apartment this week. 
I’m the editorial director of the Daily Trojan, which means that I manage the Opinion section — I assign pitches, write a column, edit stories, assign artwork and make the layout that readers see daily when they open the Opinion section of the newspaper. During my first semester in this position, I can’t count the number of times I promised to discontinue working for the newspaper and return home at a reasonable hour. And yet — somehow — I’m still here. 
As my involvement with the paper  — as well as that of many of my fellow editors, writers and photographers — has increased, the question I receive again and again, when I have to cancel social plans or reschedule study sessions, is: why? Why would a full-time student not majoring in journalism dedicate her time to a school newspaper?
Just in the last couple weeks, the DT Opinion staff has explored hard-hitting issues like whether to rename VKC, the implications of USC’s apology for their sexual assault prevention course and the effectiveness of the Engemann Health Center for mental health on campus. Last semester, the rise in campus activism last semester, gave us even more opportunities to continue crucial discussions — be it debating the hire of former football coach Steve Sarkisian or advocacy for a vice president of diversity, equity and inclusion following student diversity protests. 
It’s these campus conversations that keeps editors like me up in the newsroom, writing stories and directing pitches. This section has given me the invaluable opportunity to act as an advocate for students and explore important social issues on campus. For someone like me who loves making sense of conflict — even revels in it — I couldn’t imagine a job I would enjoy more.
On some level, my tendency to surround my life with opinions is an extension of the annoying millennial desire to make social imprints on the world around me. And it’s a manifestation of the ambition shared by Trojans across campus and of being a college student eager to prove that she deserves a seat at the adult table.
The wonderful thing about working for the Daily Trojan, too, is an undeniable sense of being part of something bigger, and though the sentiment is admittedly cliché, the experience is decidedly not. I have had the greatest privilege of working alongside some of the most intellectual student leaders on campus. We are united not just in our long hours poring over excessively large Macs and napping on red couches, but also in our unwavering commitment to informing the tens of thousands undergraduates at the University of Southern California. And I am constantly in awe of the questions asked, stories written and experiences shared by my fellow journalists every single day. 
It’s become increasingly difficult to divorce my undergraduate experience here from my time at the Daily Trojan. And even though I tried my best to resist it, the family on the fourth floor of the Student Union building has me hooked. Not to mention, of course, the chance to occupy some role in dialogues whose repercussions stretch much farther than the gates of USC.
The first time I went home after coming to college, my parents remarked, “You’re so opinionated now.” Well, I hate to break the news, but it looks like I’m staying that way.
Sonali Seth is a sophomore majoring in political science and policy, planning, development. She is also the editorial director of the Daily Trojan.

Cody Uyeda | Daily Trojan
January at USC brings many things: colder weather, a new semester and a fresh new crop of students — in this case, the spring admit portion of the class of 2019. To some, being a spring admit is a blessing in disguise, while to others, it’s the make or break point in deciding whether or not to attend USC. As a former spring admit, I’ll be the first to admit that it was the latter for me. However, looking back on my time here since moving in that January morning nearly four years ago, I’ve come to realize that being a spring admit ultimately proved to be the catalyst I never knew I needed in helping me achieve the college experience I’d always wanted. As such, I’d like to share just a few of the biggest lessons and tips I’ve learned through being a spring admit that have shaped my college experience for the better.
As spring admits we all take different routes before arriving in the spring. Some choose to knock out General Education classes at community colleges, while others choose to study new hobbies or travel the world. It may not seem like it, but each of those experiences provides a world of invaluable insight that most fall admits never have. In my gap semester, I chose to take GE classes at a local community college. As someone who wanted more than anything to go to a four-year university straight out of high school, it felt humiliating to be at community college. I felt like I couldn’t call myself a true USC student, though my admissions letter insisted otherwise. However, when I finally arrived in the spring, I realized that the experiences I had while waiting to come to USC were actually a blessing in disguise. The extra work not only cleared up my academic schedule but also provided me extra units to transfer in to get an earlier registration date, thus giving me the freedom few other freshmen possess of having some choice in what classes I wanted to take. More importantly, the practice of researching and trying different classes in the relative safety of a community college setting helped me come to USC with a clearer idea of what topics I excelled at, what classes I didn’t like and what the rigor of college coursework would be, making my transition to USC almost seamless from an academic perspective. Though my experience was just one of many possible routes, the beauty in it is that — as spring admits — the experiences we have while waiting prepares us for college in ways that most fall admits never are. So, take advantage of what you’ve accomplished while waiting in the fall, and let those newfound experiences push you forward through your time at USC.
As only a spring admit can relate to, I know exactly how hard it is to come in halfway through the year and feel like you just don’t belong, even though the red and gold admissions packet says you deserve to be here just as much as the fall admits do. It’s difficult, and it can be easy to withdraw and let that mindset get the better of you. That’s not the way to go though. As spring admits, that first semester spent waiting gives us a very real reminder that college is a lot shorter than it seems, and time is precious. With that in mind, I was determined to do anything and everything I possibly could once I arrived. There was no time to be complacent because, having already watched one semester pass me by, I wanted to ensure my remaining ones would be worth every minute of the one I had to sit out. So each semester, without fail, I’d walk through the involvement fair looking to try new things, and at one point, was in the habit of joining at least one new club a semester. Though this isn’t necessarily a model I’d advocate everyone to do, the underlying lesson I want to share is to let the “spring admit” label not become a hindrance, but a motivator that drives you to never stop exploring and really venture out of your comfort zone. College truly is short, so make each semester count.
When you first arrive, it’s inevitable that you will feel alone. Walking to and from class those first few weeks as a freshman, I felt as though people could see right through me — that the fact that I was a spring admit made me look somehow different from others. However, the truth is, no one can tell. No one. I felt like I stood out because I still hadn’t accepted being a spring admit. I still felt that I was inferior to fall admits, and it wasn’t until I accepted being a spring admit that I truly felt at home. This acceptance didn’t come easily though. What really helped me is that once I started talking to other students and getting involved on campus, I realized that there were so many more spring admits on campus than I thought. Suddenly, I didn’t feel like I was alone anymore. I found that in just about every organization at USC, there were other spring admits, often occupying leadership positions that encouraged me to reach higher and try harder. Thus, being a spring admit became not a badge of shame, but a point of connection to others in this uniquely driven group of students, all brought together by the semester that was printed on our admissions letters. It took me so long to learn, but once you truly embrace being a spring admit, the negativity so often associated with it truly does fade away, and it becomes something you can ultimately take pride in.
In the end, there will always be different takes on what it means to be a spring admit. Some say to forget it as soon as possible and assimilate quickly into the student body. Others carry it semester to semester as a form of resentment and/or feeling of being somehow less. To me though, being a spring admit is neither good nor bad. It is, in a sense, a blank canvas: one with the potential to become whatever you wish it to be. Undeniably, being a spring admit does have its disadvantages, but it also offers certain benefits that fall admits never get. Often, we get caught up in the perception of spring versus fall admission, and forget that we all made it into USC through the same levels of hard work and perseverance, which by that fact alone places us all on equal ground again. The real challenge is not when you arrive, but what you do once you arrive, no matter what semester that might be.

Like most overwhelmed, exhausted college students, I am hooked on coffee. I have come to love coffee’s unique aroma and crisp, bold flavor. Honestly speaking, at this point, coffee is basically the sole reason I pull myself out of bed for 8 a.m. classes. I start my days with a grande dark roast from Starbucks or — when I’m feeling frugal — a 16 oz travel mug filled to the brim with dining hall coffee. 
The only downsides are caffeine headaches and jitters. Everyone, from my mom to the internet, warns me that coffee isn’t healthy. I’ve read countless articles about the harmful effects of too much caffeine. Well, there’s no way I can outright quit drinking coffee, but there are alternative beverages coffee-lovers should drink every once in awhile to slowly become less obsessed. 
1. Matcha green tea latte
This drink is smooth, creamy and actually good for you. Matcha is made by blending the entire tea leaf into power, so it has 10 times more nutrients than regular green tea. You can order one from Starbucks or Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, or make your own using the simple recipe below.

Ingredients:
Recipe: Bring unsweetened almond milk to a simmer over medium-high heat. In a heatproof cup, whisk together matcha powder, boiling water and almond milk. Sweeten with sugar or agave syrup to taste.
2. Chai Tea Latte
Another coffee substitute is a chai tea latte. This drink does have some caffeine, but a person would have to drink 3 cups to match the caffeine level of coffee. Chai tea is rich in antioxidants and flavored with delicious spices. Again, you can order this latte from most coffee shops or brave the kitchen and make one yourself.

Ingredients:
Recipe: Pour boiling water over a tea bag and let steep for 4-6 minutes. Stir in honey and sugar to dissolve. Next, stir in milk.
3. Smoothies 
Not a tea person? You may want to try a nutrient-rich breakfast smoothie. Smoothies are extremely filling. Also, they help you reach the recommended amount of daily fruit.

Ingredients: 
Recipe: Put all ingredients in a blender. Blend on high for 2 minutes. Scrape sides and blend for 30 more seconds.
