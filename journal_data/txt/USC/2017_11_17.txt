On USC’s campus, 3,000 of the University’s nearly 19,000 undergraduates possess at least one characteristic that sets them apart from the rest of the University: They are the first in their families to attend a four-year college.
First-generation students, as they are called, have grown as a population at USC over the past few years, with 17 percent of this year’s incoming freshmen falling under this designation — a 5 percent increase from 2010, according to USC statistics. The numbers are even greater in graduate school, where 7,100 first-generation students make up 28 percent of total enrollment. And though it may sound like just another label, falling under the University’s ever-expanding drive to increase diversity on campus, the difficulties that many first-generation students have gone through to get where they are should not be diminished. 
In the Daily Trojan’s Fall 2017 supplement, “Power and Privilege,” the story “Bridging the First-Generation Gap” examined some of these difficulties and told the stories of several first-generation students at USC. Though the struggles are diverse and unique to each individual, they reflect a larger set of issues that overlap with those of many other students like them.
Their parents, never having attended a university, are unable to help them with the application process, let alone in navigating college life as a whole. They often come from low-income families, and struggle to put together the funds necessary to pay for their education. And there are subtle, yet pervasive deterrents that stand as roadblocks on their way to achieving success — families that don’t necessarily place a high value on higher education push students to enter the workforce. 
Despite all of these barriers, first-generation students at USC have made USC into one of the most prestigious universities in the country. But once they are here, the problems don’t stop — and in many cases, they can actually escalate. First-generation students, particularly those coming from schools in low-income neighborhoods that didn’t place a high emphasis on college-level coursework, may be unprepared to deal with the stress of college academics, requiring counseling or guidance to be as successful as their peers. They may have to work a full- or part-time job to pay for tuition, rent or other necessities, pulling their focus away from their studies. They may even be going hungry in an effort to save money for their tuition. 
USC has addressed all of these issues in one way or another in disparate parts of campus, from the Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity, which offers academic planning services, to the Virtual Food Pantry program, which provides gift cards to grocery stores for students in need to purchase meals. But the issue is that these resources are not centralized, and many times, first-generation students simply don’t know where to look for guidance on the unique confluence of issues they face. 
That’s where a first-generation student resource center can help. Like other cultural centers on campus, such as the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs or the Asian Pacific American Student Services, a first-generation resource center would provide a central gathering place for students to gather information, ask any questions they may have and feel like they are part of a community on campus. Currently, student-run organizations like the First Generation Student Union are filling this resource gap, but so much they can.
USC should follow other institutions, like the University of California system or Brown University, by setting up a resource center where first-generation students can get financial help, food aid, academic tutoring, free printing, professional advice and numerous other services that so many of them require each day. 
The University has made great strides in opening up the campus to students from low-income, non-traditional, underrepresented and first-generation backgrounds over the past few years. Programs such as the Neighborhood Academic Initiative, which provides local middle and high schoolers with academic enrichment and full scholarships to attend the University if they are accepted, demonstrate USC’s commitment to recruiting a more diverse student body, particularly from the local community. 
However, the help these students receive cannot stop once they step through USC’s gates. Getting in is only the first step of what is usually a long process of navigating the college system, struggling to pay for costs beyond tuition and working against the odds to stay in school, graduate and even attend graduate school. If a student has to drop out or take a semester off because they cannot afford to attend USC or are overwhelmed by a workload they have never before experienced, then so much of the work the University put into getting them to come here will be discredited.
By extending its commitment to supporting diversity beyond the initial recruitment phase, USC will ensure that these students can be successful, and bring what they’ve learned back to their communities. For a school that many deride as the “University of Spoiled Children,” doing so would go a long way toward proving that USC is more than just an ivory tower, but is an accessible institution for all members of the Trojan Family.

Gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey were solid wins for the Democrats. While it certainly would have been difficult for former Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno to claim the seat given her veteran status of the extremely unpopular Christie Administration, winner Phil Murphy himself is a former CEO of Goldman Sachs. Similarly, Virginia’s Governor-elect Ralph Northam ran on fairly centrist Democratic principles, with a noticeable absence of anti-Trump rhetoric (not to say Northam ever supported, or came close to supporting, President Donald Trump or his policies). 
This is to say that two very moderate Democrats locked up important seats, and did so in the era of Trump without platforms relying on anti-Trump sentiments. Two reasons why this should resonate with Democrats, and reflect on midterms to come: First, it might be reasonable to conclude that, like Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential bid revealed, running primarily on opposition will not be sufficient — Democrats want a new message; second, that if Democrats want to look for wins and rebuild, they’ll need to start more locally — perhaps turning the tide toward an awareness of smaller elections that has been necessary for years. 
In an era when the Whigs were fracturing along intraparty divides, the original Republicans came to power and gained prominence in Congress by focusing on mid-level elections; winning local and gubernatorial, working up to congressional, and eventually claiming the presidency. There has always been a value to local elections, and the power local offices hold over the everyday lives of constituencies are often gravely overlooked. 
As the Democratic Party attempts to search out new leaders and fresh, compelling platforms (even amid hurdles like Donna Brazile’s revelations and Sen. Al Franken’s scandal surrounding sexual misconduct allegations) they also require wins to energize the base — which is typical for progressive-leaning voters. Without a presidential election coming anytime soon (I assume), voters feeling anxious about the Trump administration have been eager to direct that energy toward any winnable election — former Democratic nominee for Congress Jon Ossoff’s race this summer perhaps being the first, and these recent gubernatorial elections being the most recent. Luckily, this may actually mean local elections are going to get attention from voters who might not otherwise pay attention to them. A bottom-up approach may serve the Democrats better in the long run in the reconstruction of their message than playing the waiting game for 2020. 
But for 2018, this may lead Democratic candidates to consider the weight they will attribute to anti-Trump platforms. It seems that opposition to a nativist, nationalist administration of varying degrees of ineptitude is no longer a plus for a candidate, but a bare minimum of Democratic affiliation. In this sense, Democrats will have to find a fresh message, do what Republicans under the Obama administration weren’t able to; gather opposition not only to unfavorable ideas, but actually offer viable alternatives. 
As 2018 approaches, Democratic candidates will need to get a clue of what their voters are really looking for — besides a warm body that agrees not to dismantle basic health care. Preserving progressive approaches to social issues is still necessary. I do not believe centrism necessitates compromise on principles grounded in the life and liberty of marginalized groups. However, it does mean the party will need to put serious effort toward forming coalitions with incremental reform in mind, and put money behind candidates who are willing to remember groups who historically voted blue not for social justice and inclusion, but for economic equity, job security and basic protections for Main Street.
Like Northam and Murphy, our new crop of candidates should have progressive goals with the intention of reaching them through achievable, centrist measures. The Democrats no longer boast congressional majorities; the kind of forceful change we observed with the passage of the Affordable Care Act will not be possible in this climate, under this president. During eight years of the Obama administration, Democrats profited from fit leadership and strong roots. Today’s world demands a more nuanced, more sophisticated style of politicking, and hopefully voters will support candidates who have the skill to do so. Either way, news from the East Coast was good. Hopefully, a year from now, more will follow.

The Trojan Marching Band performed for the crowd at Conquest before the main musical acts arrived. Photo by Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Students gathered in McCarthy Quad on Thursday for the annual Conquest celebration in honor of Troy Week, leading up to the USC-UCLA rivalry football game. The event — a collaboration among Undergraduate Student Government Concerts Committee, Trojan Pride, Late Night ’SC and the Office of Campus Activities — featured a spirit rally, carnival and live performances by 17-year old SoundCloud rapper Lil Pump and electronic dance music artist Mr. Carmack. 
“I thought Conquest was really good,” said Brittney Obanor, a freshman majoring in psychology. “It was a lot better than the Welcome Back Concert … it was less crowded, and it had more activities.”
The celebration kicked off at 5 p.m. and featured booths where students could participate in various activities to win merchandise such as “Conquest” T-shirts and drawstring bags, as well as food truck vendors including The Grilled Cheese Truck, Cousins Maine Lobster and My Delight Cupcakery.
Conquest performances began at 7 p.m. with a spirit rally, where student groups such as the USC Song Girls, UnderSCore a cappella and hip-hop dance team Chaotic 3 performed. The Trojan Marching Band also performed, accompanied by various Trojan sports teams, who encouraged students to attend their games. 
The rally was followed by the lighting of the Bruin Bonfire and a fireworks show. 
“My favorite part was definitely the bonfire, because especially with a giant crowd … I just had this sense of school spirit,” said Isabel Cervantes, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television. “And the fireworks show right after just topped it off for the hype and intensity that the game’s going to bring.”
At the end of the fireworks show, concert opener Mr. Carmack took the stage. 
Mr. Carmack, a hip-hop and electronic dance music DJ, opened the concert with a set that stayed true to his motto, according to his website: “Make music like no one’s listening.” Mr. Carmack performed without saying a single word until the end of his set, using only his music to engage the audience. His set included remixes of tracks such as Kendrick Lamar’s “DNA.” and Future and Drake’s “Jumpman.”
Before concert headliner Lil Pump performed, a few unnamed performers took the stage to hype the artist up and perform other music, making students unsure about when Lil Pump would actually perform — although he was scheduled to start at 9:40 p.m., he didn’t come on stage until 9:56 p.m.
“The three people who were up on stage before him, I had no idea who they were, I was confused [about whether]  one of them [was] Lil Pump, but then he finally came on stage,” Cervantes said. 
Lil Pump performed many of his songs once he finally came to the stage, including his most  popular track, “Gucci Gang,” but Cervantes didn’t enjoy his set. 
“Lil Pump’s style of music is not necessarily my taste,” Cervantes said. “All of his songs sounded the same, and I couldn’t understand anything he was saying.”
Carina Glastris, one of the Concerts Committee co-directors, said the committee chose both Mr. Carmack and Lil Pump due to their potential to become more well-known artists in the future.
“For both Welcome Back and Conquest, we’ve looked to book talent that is up and coming,” Glastris said. “So, we went into this show with the same mentality and chose both our headliner and our opening act because we see them as rising stars in the music industry, people that USC students are going to connect with a lot.” 
According to Glastris, this is the first year that Conquest has been centered around a theme: vintage USC. 
“It makes it more of a cohesive vision and experience,” Glastris said. “The reason why music festivals have been so successful in the way that they have, especially small, boutique festivals, is because they are built and kind of imagined around some type of a theme.”
Another new feature of this year’s Conquest was major corporate sponsors, such as Warner Bros. and Postmates, who provided funding for Conquest attractions like the Postmates-sponsored Ferris wheel, according to Glastris. 
Besides the music performances and spirit rally, Conquest also featured carnival attractions, such as mini-golf course and an interactive Fujifilm Polaroid photo booth where students took photos in front of a board designed to look like an open yearbook, and then added them to the yearbook, making them a part of the background for the next photo. 
“Because of the level of effort we’ve seen from everybody on our e-board … this is probably the biggest Conquest yet,” said Concerts Committee Co-director Tufan Nadjafi. 
Kate Sequeira contributed to this report.

Nightly News anchor Lester Holt spoke about interviewing President Donald Trump and moderating a presidential debate with Dean Willow Bay at Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday night. Photo by Tomás Mier | Daily Trojan
“See, my hand started to shake when you said that,” said NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt after being asked about moderating the first 2016 presidential debate at an event hosted at Wallis Annenberg Hall Thursday night.
Along with analyzing clips of the debate, Holt, in conversation with Willow Bay, the dean of the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism, spoke about politics, journalism and transparency.
The two then discussed different clips of Holt moderating the first Hillary Clinton-Donald Trump debate, which Holt said he had not watched in its entirety. He explained that being the moderator was one of the most challenging things in his career.
“The difficult thing was turning on cable TV and hearing people talk about me,” he said. “You think it doesn’t get into your head, but it does.”
Holt spoke about interviewing Trump after he had become president — explaining how quickly Trump opened up to speak to him following the president’s firing of FBI director James Comey. 
He also spoke about visiting a U.S. naval base in South Korea, where he said the military is prepared for a nuclear attack from North Korea.
“When you realize how many people could die, it’s quite disturbing,” he said.
The conversation then opened to questions from pre-selected journalism students. Garrett Schwartz, a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, asked about a journalist’s use of social media.
Holt explained that social media is important to keep people informed, but that he was always cautious.
“I am very guarded, because that’s what gets us in trouble,” Holt said. “When we get into the pundit world too much, we risk to fall into those traps.”
Holt addressed issues of objectivity in journalism, explaining that the most important thing for a journalist is remaining objective.
“You don’t just need to hold yourself accountable, but others accountable too,” Holt said. “You have to be clear with who you are.”
CORRECTION: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Holt spoke about visiting a U.S. Naval base in North Korea. The base was in South Korea. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
Wow! News flash!
Surprised to hear that Lester Holt visited “a U.S. naval base in North Korea”. Dennis Rodman must have been there too to help him get out. Or is it that Willow Bay no longer requires a desk editor to watch over freshman staff?

Photo from The Neighborhood Data for Social Change Platform 
The Sol Price Center for Social Innovation recently launched a neighborhood data platform for Los Angeles County, which allows policymakers, nonprofit organizations and community members to access data to better understand the places where they work and live.
The Neighborhood Data for Social Change Platform is a public resource, and its creators’ main goal was to present accessible and interactive data for community users. 
“What was clear from the beginning was that a lot of folks who need data don’t always know what kind of data to visit,” said Gary Painter, director of the Sol Price Center for Social Innovation. “There’s kind of data overload nowadays, so one of the things we didn’t want to do is an open data tech world where you just throw up lots of data hoping people can figure their way [themselves].”
To put the neighborhood data in context, the center has published data stories on the platform and on the website of KCETLink, the media sponsor.
“We will sometimes generate stories ourselves of what are coming up or interesting questions or puzzles that are issues that are emerging from the data here in L.A. County,” Painter said. “Sometimes there’s partners in the community that have a story to tell and we can contextualize that with the data.”
So far, four stories have been published, which speak to childhood health, the effect of pollution on health, demographic shifts and rising rent. The stories are being published under City Rising on KCET, a program focused on social issues across California, said Justin Cram, director of content development at KCETLink.
For some stories, writers contrast multiple sets of data to create a composite data set, which has brought about meaningful results, Cram said. In one particular story about Irwindale, Calif., health was found to not be as directly affected by the high level of pollution.
“That I think is really powerful, that you can take these multiple data sets and you can begin to find really interesting correlations,” Cram said. “This provides interesting resources both in terms [of] journalists as well as organizers and planners and different people that are working in the social space.” 
In the future, these data stories are expected to be published every two weeks.
In 2018, the Sol Price Center plans to host community training workshops on how to use the platform. The workshops would most likely be hosted once a month at USC and in the community and be free and open to the public, said Megan Goulding, program manager for the Price School of Public Policy.
“The hope is that we’ll get a lot of stakeholders like government folks, nonprofit folks, advocacy groups and residents coming to these meetings to learn how to actually use these tools,” Goulding said. 
The idea for a data platform first emerged a little over 20 years ago, Painter said, when it was suggested that metropolitan areas provide easily accessible data to allow for effective planning and assist nonprofits in understanding the populations they serve. 
UCLA aided in the first platform of data analysis then, but the site went dormant five years later, Painter said. 
Then, five years ago, Los Angeles County was approached by the Urban Institute, which coordinates the National Neighborhood Indicators partnership, to develop a new platform. The Sol Price Center took on the initiative.
“There is an interest in Los Angeles because it’s the second largest metropolitan area in the country,” Painter said. “It doesn’t make sense for L.A. to be absent from that network.”

Simrin Player, a freshman studying at the Kaufman School of Dance, has performed on tour with Willow Smith and Justin Bieber and starred in a Sears commercial with Selena Gomez. Photo courtesy of interview subject.
The Glorya Kaufman School of Dance’s motto, “The New Movement,” characterizes the school’s unique ability to combine artistry, location and world-class professionals in a curriculum that revolutionizes the norms of dance performance. 
Simrin Player, a freshman majoring in dance, is at the forefront of this mission for change. Before coming to USC, Player had already amassed an impressive resume, according to her website. After being discovered in a B-boy/B-girl dance battle at 9 years old, she danced on tour with Willow Smith and Justin Bieber, performed in Step Up 3D and starred in a Sears back-to-school commercial with Selena Gomez. Player came to Kaufman with the desire to not only improve her technical abilities, but also re-examine how she approaches dance as a practice. 
The Daily Trojan interviewed Player about how she got to this point in her career, and what she plans to pursue in the future. 
Daily Trojan: How did you start dancing? 
Simrin Player: I started dancing when I was 3 years old. My mom put me in tap and ballet class, and I fell in love with it. Since then, I’ve been dancing every single day.
DT:  Can you tell us about some of your favorite projects? 
SP: I did a commercial quite recently for [Shoe Carnival], and that was pretty awesome. It was a national commercial for a back-to-school campaign. That was a lot of fun because I got the opportunity to not only dance, but also showcase my ability to act. Another one of my favorite projects was dancing for Justin Bieber and Willow Smith on [Bieber’s] U.K. tour. It was pretty incredible. I was roughly 11 or 12, and I had the opportunity to perform all around the United Kingdom and Ireland in front of huge crowds every night. I made a lot of memories with Justin, Willow and the other dancers.
DT: How did you come across that opportunity? 
SP: I actually have a close family friend who is a huge choreographer and artistic director in the entertainment industry, and she has afforded me a lot of opportunities. She booked me for Willow Smith’s “Whip My Hair” music video, and after the video was done shooting, I was asked to become one of Willow’s official dancers. Every project that Willow did, I also did.
DT: Why did you choose to get involved in the entertainment industry?
SP: I just love performing. I love the entertainment industry because for one — it’s a lot of fun. I get to spread my passion for dance in front of crowds, or on a TV, or via YouTube. It’s a way I can touch a lot of people with my passion for dance.
DT: Which styles of dance do you prefer? Are there any styles that you would like to pick up?
SP: Some of my favorite styles of dance are hip-hop and contemporary, although I do love ballet, too. I would like to become a better tap dancer. I find tap incredibly fascinating, but I am absolutely horrible at it. 
DT: Who inspires you to pursue a future in dance? 
SP: I would say the people I surround myself with, especially here at Kaufman. All of my peers that I have been granted the opportunity to dance with are absolutely phenomenal, and they inspire me each and every day. I would also say my teachers, and people that have a huge influence in my life. My mom and my dad influence me to pursue dance and keep pursuing my dreams. 
DT: How has your style of dance matured over the years?
SP: Over the years, with more training, I have become more of a technical dancer. I think that I’ve always had this raw quality when it comes to dance, like being able to perform and have tons of energy. But I’ve also learned how to contain and mellow that energy and become more technical with how I dance. So it’s kind of fusing between that raw quality that I already have and my new foundation for technique.
DT: What made you want to come to USC? 
SP: USC has always been my dream school. I loved [that] it was in Los Angeles, and I’ve already had a career in the entertainment industry. So it’s kind a great location to pursue my academics and that professional world. And then a couple of years ago was the founding of the Glorya Kaufman School of Dance, so it seemed like a no-brainer to come to USC.
DT: Is there anything you’ve learned since coming to Kaufman?
SP: I have learned so much since coming to Kaufman. I think that the way that I approach dance has become more academic, and I’ve learned new qualities of movement. I’ve been afforded the opportunity to work with so many guest artists and working choreographers, and it has had a huge influence on my maturity and quality as a dancer.
DT: Are there any productions that you’re involved in right now? 
SP: I’m not in a production right now, but Kaufman is currently having a “show week,” so we have a show every day this week. We have a class called “Repertory and Performance,” and some of the choreographers that will be seen in the shows this week are Paul Taylor, Barak Marshall, Dwight Rhoden, Aszure Barton and some of our own faculty. During that class, we learn the choreography, rehearse it and then have the opportunity to perform it. 
DT: What’s something unexpected readers should know about you? 
SP: I love chocolate. Even though I’m kind of allergic to it, I still eat it all the time. I especially love peppermint bark, and don’t even get me started on peppermint mocha.
DT: Where do you hope to see yourself in the industry in five years?
SP: I would like to graduate with a [Bachelor of Fine Arts] from USC. I would like to be able to work more as a dancer or pursue more of the behind-the-scenes aspects as a choreographer or as a creative director. I haven’t really limited my options — I wouldn’t turn down anything that comes my way.

Whether focused on politics, entertainment or sports, podcasts allow people to dive into their interests in an unfiltered and lucrative channel for communication. 
Subsequently, universities including USC are making strides to promote student innovation and storytelling through podcasts. The School of Dramatic Arts introduced a course this semester called, “Creating the Hit Podcast.” The course allows students to study elements necessary for popular podcasts and create podcasts of their own to share their unique perspective on a topic of their choosing. 
This class is taught by actress Anna Faris, star of CBS’ Mom, who hosts her own podcast Anna Faris Is Unqualified with USC alumnus and former film producer Sim Sarna. On her show, Faris dishes on relationship advice, interviews her peers in Hollywood and even crosses over with other popular podcasts like My Favorite Murder. 
Together, Faris and Sarna teach students how to replicate their craft. The class consists of 18 students who observe Faris lecture on podcast delivery and marketing. In addition, Faris and Sarna interview some of the most successful podcast creators and invite a different industry insider to speak each week. During one class, for example, the actress hosted YouTube star Shane Dawson. All discussions are recorded and conclude with a Q&A session. 
In the class, students are tasked with adopting a topic of their choice for their main project. Usually, the students collaborate in pairs or groups to create a podcast idea, where students are encouraged to be creative. 
Haley Finerman, a junior majoring in theatre and cognitive science, and Daniela Silva, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism, are working together on a podcast called Get On Your Kneez. Finerman describes it as a “self-guided exploration of the new testament from a Jewish and atheist point of view.”
“Living in America, Christianity is so present, and we felt ignorant not knowing anything about the history of the religion,” Finerman said. “The podcast will be useful to teach ourselves and the world.”
Finerman, Silva and their classmates must first pitch podcast ideas to Faris, who personally critiques topics and makes suggestions for improvement.
“We had to create a trailer and marketing strategy,” Finerman said. “The class focuses not only on the development of creative and innovative ideas, but [also on] the marketability and business side of things as well.”
For the remainder of the semester, the groups will record and market their respective podcasts, which will be published on iTunes at the end of the semester.

Nayanika Kapoor | Daily Trojan
Last Tuesday marked the long-awaited triumph of different identities being welcomed into the political system. For the first time in a long time, it felt like the country was finally celebrating diversity, rather than shying away from it. People emerged from the shadows and even politically apathetic citizens rallied to elect trusted civil servants, and to show those in power that their harmful rhetoric will not be tolerated. Among those who led the resistance against the current administration were Danica Roem, the only openly transgender person serving in a state legislature; Andrea Jenkins as the first transgender African American to be elected to office in Minneapolis; Justin Fairfax, a black Democrat elected as  lieutenant governor in Virginia; and several others. But one victory hit close to my heart: the Indian American Sikh mayor elected in Hoboken, N.J. After being targeted with racist ads, Ravi Bhalla’s victory embodied the values that seem to be commonly forgotten in the Trump era, where white supremacists, hate crimes and exclusionary policy seem to run rampant.
As a millennial studying journalism and politics, it is safe to say that Indian Americans don’t really fit the mold of a typical political candidate. I’ve seen several representations of Indians as IT assistants in an office, or 7-Eleven owners, but I rarely hear about Indians in law or politics — whether in the media or in real life. The two that I grew up with and now hear about most often, Bobby Jindal and Nikki Haley, neither appeal to the Indian American communities nor accurately represent my political beliefs. It is frustrating, to say the least, to feel like there is no space for you in the industry of your choice. Indian Americans are a rapidly growing demographic and greatly successful in the United States, but are underrepresented in several fields. 
There are currently five Indian American representatives in Congress. Kamala Harris, Ami Bera and Ro Khanna — all representing California, which contains 20 percent of the Indian population in the United States. Outside of California, Raja Krishnamoorthi holds a congressional seat in Illinois and Pramila Jayapal in Washington. Unfortunately, most of these representatives tend not to appeal to the Indian American community in the same way that other minorities represent their community’s interests. I’ve noticed that in my community, we have great pride in the few Indian American politicians who hold elected office, regardless of political stance, but unfortunately, this admiration seldom translates into action. Rarely do Indian Americans phone-bank for their candidates, work on the campaign or even show up at the polls. The Asian American population in general has a serious issue with voter turnout. According to Pew Research. Asian-American voter turnout was 31 percent in 2010, less than both African American voters at 44 percent and white voters at 49 percent.

If Indian American constituents felt like their vote made an impact and affected policy decisions, I believe that a far larger portion of the population would make the effort to vote. As one of the most highly educated minorities in the United States, Indian Americans are aware of political issues, well-educated on them and discuss them often. It’s only in the actual “showing-up” that we fall short. 
Another problem within Asian communities, which tend to have a higher median income, is that Asian Americans believe the current American system has worked for them, so they don’t need to engage in the political system. Incidents of racism and inequality are seen as a “price to pay” for their relative success in the United States and the community genuinely believes that none of it is going to change — so what’s the point in trying? The “pick yourself up by your bootstraps” mentality prevalent in this culture contributes to its political apathy.
I’ve often been frustrated by the lack of empathy toward social issues I’ve observed in my community. Indian Americans and Asians in general, do not join the forces when it comes to issues that affect other minorities, and trying to get my community to engage has been an uphill battle, to say the least. But then again, why would they? Because the political system ignores them, they hide. 
I hope that in the future, Indian American youth like myself don’t feel alienated when they decide that they want to pursue careers in law and public policy. Indian Americans aren’t only necessary in elected office — they are necessary in staffing positions, as policymakers and as lawyers. Having a representative like Harris, even if she might not strongly identify with my community, has allowed me to feel like I might finally have a place making it in the field of my choice. In the next election cycle, I hope to see a shift both within the community and outside that makes us feel like our voices are valuable and inspires more political participation. Tuesday was a wonderful first step, but we have a long, long way to go.

On Saturday, USC and UCLA face off for the 84th time in a rivalry that includes bragging rights, history and lots of familiarity. The Bruins enter the game with a 5-5 record, but plenty to play for in what should be an emotional contest. 
“It is a rivalry game,” head coach Clay Helton said. “There’s a lot of pride with both teams. I think [special teams coordinator John Baxter] told me today, there’s like 57 kids on each team right here from Southern California. We all know each other and that pride of being able to be the city champ for 365 days, I think is important to everybody.” 
The Trojans have already punched their ticket to Levi’s Stadium for the Pac-12 Championship in two weeks, but a win over the Bruins is vital for other reasons. When the College Football Playoff rankings were unveiled on Tuesday, USC polled as the highest ranked Pac-12 team for the first time since Week 8. 
Currently, FiveThirtyEight is giving the Trojans an 8 percent chance of making the playoffs. To accomplish that goal against all odds, the team must take care of business against UCLA on Saturday. 
“I think our chances of making the playoff, they’re slim,” sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold said on Tuesday. “But they’re still there. I think that obviously to do that, we got to win out. But right now we’re just focused on UCLA and winning this game.” 
UCLA will be relying on an explosive passing offense in their effort to put the Trojans on upset alert. Much has been said about UCLA quarterback Josh Rosen over the past three years — some claim he’s the second coming, others predict he’ll be a bigger bust than JaMarcus Russell. In reality, the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle; he’s having a solid bounce-back campaign after an injury-riddled 2016, throwing for 3,094 yards and 21 touchdowns on a 62.2 percent completion percentage.
“[Rosen] is so confident in releasing the football and finding open windows,” Helton said. “There’s no hesitation in his game, [he has] great anticipatory skills. He’s got extreme arm talent, can make every throw on the field. And probably the thing I’ve been most impressed with is his accuracy, especially deep ball accuracy.” 
Rosen may captain one of the most prolific offenses in the Pac-12 (the unit is averaging a third-best 462.5 yards per game), but he’s hardly the only Bruin playmaker. Running backs Bolu Olorunfunmi and Solo Jamabo make up a formidable tandem both on the field and in pronunciation guides (846 combined rushing yards, 12 combined syllables). 
Meanwhile, wide receiver Jordan Lasley has become one of Rosen’s favorite targets for the quarterback’s signature long bombs this season, especially with fellow star wideout Darren Andrews going down with an injury. Lasley has hauled in 705 yards in just six games played.
USC’s offense is also elite (it’s second in the conference in total yards per game), and it’s been especially explosive over the past three weeks, averaging 45 points since the Notre Dame loss. With playmakers like junior tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe, senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. and sophomore wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. all healthy after dealing with injuries for much of the year, the offense’s ascension has coincided with good fortune on the injury front. Over the first half of the season, the receiving corps remained a big question mark, but now Darnold seems to have an arsenal of weapons at his disposal (including junior running back Ronald Jones II who’s run wild for 552 in the past three wins).
“We’re starting to get healthy and I think our play has improved, especially offensively with the health that’s coming back,” Helton said. “Guys on the offensive line playing together, getting Daniel Imatorbhebhe back, I think has been a real help for us. And any time that you can keep guys in that lineup and build that chemistry with the quarterback, I believe it helps.’
This weekend’s game against UCLA is not just important within the College Football Playoff and Pac-12 landscapes; it doubles as the last home game for a group of seniors that dealt with plenty of adversity over the course of their careers (fifth-year seniors such as redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins and Mitchell Jr. played for three different head coaches). For the likes of Hawkins, Mitchell Jr. and senior outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu (16.5 career tackles for loss and 5.5 sacks), Saturday will be a particularly emotional game.
“I told them today what a special group they are,” Helton said. “Really, the word I used is legacy, that they’re going to have the opportunity to leave a legacy here with what they accomplished, with hopefully what they do on Saturday.”

Some athletes, like Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, are connected by rivalry, while others, like LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, are connected by friendship. USC redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold and UCLA junior quarterback Josh Rosen are linked together – both now and likely during the course of their professional careers – because of proximity. Both came from the same 2014 recruiting class, both are from Southern California, both play college football within a cozy 15-mile radius and both are bona fide NFL Draft prospects should they choose to leave after this season. 
Rosen isn’t going anywhere
UCLA junior quarterback Josh Rosen usually has a knack for staying in the headlines. 
This summer, numerous articles pointed out how uncharacteristically low-key the top NFL Draft prospect was during the off-season. One Los Angeles Times column in July read, “UCLA’s Josh Rosen is a shadow of former brash self.”
They all spoke too soon. In August, Rosen broke his silence and re-entered the sports talk show news cycle with the comments, “football and school don’t go together,” and “raise the SAT requirement at Alabama and see what kind of team they have.”
Surprisingly, Rosen has stayed out of the headlines for most of this season. Perhaps it’s because he’s matured as all those articles initially suspected. Perhaps it’s because his team isn’t very good (the Bruins are 5-5) or particularly relevant on the national stage, despite the fact that his play has been quietly solid all year (3,094 yards and 21 touchdowns with nine interceptions).
Regardless, his brief period outside of the spotlight comes to an end this week. All eyes are on the first ever duel between Rosen and USC quarterback Sam Darnold — the next time they face each other will probably be on a Sunday. Not to mention, it’s impossible to talk about Rosen’s career without also mentioning USC. 
He grew up a Trojans fan, but chose the Bruins over them because, according to Sports Illustrated, he “really wanted to just mess with everyone” and preferred the potential of UCLA over the established dominance of USC. The connection doesn’t stop there. USC head coach Clay Helton has known Rosen for nearly a decade. 
“I had the opportunity, when I first got here, to watch him in Pop Warner when my son was playing,” Helton said. “To watch him grow from an eighth grader basically up to what he is now, which is an NFL football player, has been a lot of fun.”
Rosen entered UCLA in 2015 with ungodly expectations — Heisman, National Championship, No. 1 draft pick were phrases that floated through the air as seamlessly as his deep ball. During his freshman year in which he threw for 3,670 yards and led the Bruins to a solid 8-5 record, they all seemed to be within reach. 
The ensuing two seasons, however, have been filled with injuries, disappointment and untapped potential for both Rosen and the UCLA football program. There have been no awards, no championships, and maybe most crushingly, a new quarterback named Sam Darnold from a school 25 minutes away, emerged as many experts’ top projected pick in the 2018 NFL Draft. 
But the most glaring shadow cast over Rosen’s collegiate career is the fact that he’s never been able to defeat the Trojans. In his freshman year, he threw two interceptions at the Coliseum and USC dominated en route to a 40-21 win. Last year, he missed the final six games of the season including the Trojans’ 36-14 drubbing over the Bruins.
For Rosen, Saturday not only represents a chance to prove himself as a first round draft prospect against his most direct competition. It also represents possibly Rosen’s final chance to exorcise his biggest demon in USC and prove that his college career wasn’t a complete bust. 
If Rosen finally wins, spoiling the Trojans’ season and cementing his decision to pick an upstart UCLA program over USC, one thing will be certain: he will be anything but quiet about it.
Darnold is nobody’s underdog
Maybe Darnold and Rosen are in similar positions now, but their origins are vastly different. Rosen was a blue chip out of St. John Bosco High School, a five-star from one of California’s most prestigious high school football programs and the No. 1-ranked quarterback in the 2014 recruiting class. Darnold was none of those things.
After starting his high school career as a receiver and linebacker and then missing most of his junior year of high school due to a foot injury, Darnold was late to show up on major college programs’ radars. Rosen, on the other hand, is one of UCLA’s most prized and hyped up recruits in school history. Darnold wasn’t even the most highly touted quarterback recruit in his own freshman class at USC (that was Ricky Town, who eventually transferred). When “Chosen Rosen” was throwing for 300-yard games as a true freshman in 2015, an anonymous Darnold was leading the Trojans’ scout team offense.
But the story doesn’t end there. As a redshirt freshman last season, Darnold took over the starting quarterback back job from Max Browne three games into the season and subsequently set the college football world ablaze. One year after being a third-string quarterback, Darnold earned the 2017 Rose Bowl MVP award for his 453-yard, five-touchdown performance in USC’s dramatic 52-49 win over Penn State.
As Darnold’s meteoric rise was commenced, Rosen spent most of last year sidelined by injuries. Rosen was unable to play in last year’s USC-UCLA game, delaying a much-anticipated matchup between the two signal-callers. Suddenly the most high-profile player in Los Angeles became Darnold and not Rosen. After his scintillating freshman season, Rosen graced the 2016 Sports Illustrated College Football Preview cover. This year, it was Sam Darnold, signaling that both metaphorically and literally, there was a new poster boy in town.
At first, it appeared as if Darnold couldn’t handle the newfound hype and pressure that comes with being the “it” guy. He tossed nine interceptions in his first six games and fumbled in key situations in losses to Washington State and Notre Dame. Darnold looked flustered and uncomfortable during much of this season’s first half, unlike in his redshirt freshman year, when his calm, cool and collected nature was considered his biggest strength.
Yet, Darnold enters this year’s UCLA game on a tear, much like he did last year. In the last three games since the Notre Dame loss, he’s thrown for 906 yards with seven touchdowns and just one interception. He’s starting to realize every game doesn’t rest solely on his shoulders. He’s starting to trust his young receiving corps and take what the defense gives him rather than forcing passes that are not there.
While he had a humble start, Darnold is no longer an underdog — he’s just too physically talented, too successful and too highly regarded for that designation. Still, his beginnings follow him everywhere, especially into his long-awaited duel with Rosen. They serve as a reminder that you don’t need to be a prodigy in order to become the cover boy. 
“It’s just another opportunity to show kind of my competitiveness,” Darnold said. “I think I can show that again this Saturday.”

This isn’t exactly what we expected.
UCLA will make the trip to South Central on Saturday to take on the Trojans in a primetime matchup. This was a game all fans had circled on their calendars when schedules were first released last year: It would be a showdown between the nation’s two premier quarterbacks — redshirt sophomore Sam Darnold and junior Josh Rosen — as they duked it out to be the No. 1 overall pick in next year’s NFL Draft, and whether it was for one team or both, there would likely be significant postseason implications on the line.
After three months of up-and-down college football in Los Angeles, much has changed. Darnold has taken a step back somewhat after his blistering debut campaign, struggling with turnovers and sparking rumors he may return to school next fall. Meanwhile, Rosen has spearheaded a powerful UCLA passing attack, but has also thrown nine interceptions (Darnold has 11) while steering his team to a 5-5 overall record. 
Forget playoffs: The Bruins are fighting for bowl eligibility, and on the other side, No. 11 USC, despite clinching the Pac-12 South in Colorado last Saturday, blew its national championship hopes weeks ago. The stakes might not be the same as they were expected to be at the beginning of the season, but they still remain high and serious for both teams.
So if this weekend’s game is neither a playoff chase nor a de facto battle for the top draft pick, then what are we looking forward to? Pride aside, does it even matter whether the Trojans win or lose in the rivalry face-off at the Coliseum on Saturday?
 In another year, the answer to that question would actually be a clear no. With a Pac-12 Championship berth already secured, USC could take it half-speed against the Bruins and essentially give itself two weeks off before fighting for the conference crown on Dec. 1. Then, with a win in Santa Clara, it would be on to the Rose Bowl.
But no roses await the Trojans this year, as Pasadena hosts a leg of the playoff. With a run at the national title out of reach (barring one of the most absurd final three weeks in college football history), USC can only hope for the best possible at-large bowl bid, meaning a loss to UCLA could prove catastrophic. In the past, the Rose Bowl provided a sense of security for the Trojans as long as they won the conference. This year, it’s all different.
A random bowl berth may sound trivial — it probably is in reality — but for the Trojans this season, perception has been everything. A trip to Glendale for the Fiesta Bowl looks a whole lot better than a trip to San Diego for another Holiday Bowl, and that could make all the difference for this team.
Think about it: Imagine if USC takes down UCLA on Saturday before winning the Pac-12 two weeks later. 
If the Trojans beat a team like, say, No. 6 Auburn in the Fiesta Bowl (or even played a competitive game), the season could be considered a success. Sure, there will always be the disappointment of falling short of a national title, but wrapping up the campaign as a two- or three-loss conference champion in a New Year’s Six bowl would be a worthy follow up to last season’s Rose Bowl victory, and it would show that this team is consistently remaining in the top tier of national competition.
On the other hand, if the Trojans fall to the Bruins this week, not only would they suffer their second rivalry loss of the season, but they would also play themselves out of a marquee bowl — even with a conference championship. 
Despite the team’s late-season surge, question marks remain about USC’s consistency on either side of the ball, and the full-blown panic that set in after the humiliation at Notre Dame last month would return if the Trojans can’t put away a middling UCLA squad at home. 
This is a must-win game in the sense that the win is completely expected; if the Trojans can’t perform, their skill will be called into question, especially after they didn’t move up at all in the CFP ranking despite a win last week.
In fact, a loss to the Bruins resigns USC to at least a three-loss season, and with a complete loss of momentum, you’d anticipate more to follow: The campaign would end no differently than it did under the likes of former quarterback Cody Kessler or former coaches Ed Orgeron and Steve Sarkisian. The pressure is now heavy on Darnold and head coach Clay Helton to prove that the program has advanced beyond those days.
Of course, crushing the Bruins won’t mean anything without a win two weeks later, as a loss in the Pac-12 Championship would condemn the Trojans to the same fate as a loss to UCLA would. But that’s a problem for later, and the Trojans will be best to focus on the game at hand, especially since they won’t know their opponent for the conference championship until next week. 
The season is on the line this Saturday. Darnold has the opportunity to boost himself to 2-0 in his career against UCLA and lift USC to another double-digit-win campaign — with two more on the horizon. Meanwhile, Rosen and the Bruins are fighting to earn bowl eligibility and keep their year alive, and they have a chance to throw a wrench into the Trojans’ season en route to some sort of redemption in a bowl game.
It’s all to play for this weekend, and we get to see two of the top quarterbacks in the country go head-to-head to keep their campaigns alive. It’s not the Pac-12 South title showdown we saw in 2015, but each team desperately needs a win. It’s also the first (and possibly only) edition of Darnold vs. Rosen. What more can you ask for?

As the No. 11 Trojans prepare to wrap up the 2017 regular season against UCLA this weekend, the football team’s 2018 schedule was released on Thursday.
USC opens its campaign at the Coliseum against UNLV next Labor Day weekend, hosting the Rebels on Sept. 1 in the second-ever meeting between the two programs. The Trojans then enter a two-game road stretch, first opening Pac-12 play at Stanford. The Trojans beat the Cardinal 42-24 in Los Angeles in Week 2 of this season, and the two sides could rematch in the conference championship on Dec. 1 if Stanford wins out and No. 18 Washington takes down No. 14 Washington State next week.
USC then travels to Austin for a matchup against Texas. The Trojans and Longhorns clashed in Week 3 this fall for the first time since the two programs’ classic national championship game in 2006: Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold led USC to a comeback victory, and freshman kicker Chase McGrath converted his first career field goals — one to tie the game as time expired and another to win in double overtime.
After their tilt in Austin, the Trojans return home on a short week to face off against Washington State — much like this season, when the team took on the Cougars on a Friday coming off a trip to Berkeley. Unlike September’s trip to Pullman, however, USC will be at home next year as the team seeks revenge for its first loss of the season at Washington State this year. The Cougars’ visit to the Coliseum will be their first since 2013, when they pulled off a 10-7 upset thanks to a late field goal.
USC then travels to Tucson for a game versus Arizona. The Trojans edged the Wildcats 49-35 at the Coliseum two weeks ago after blowing a 22-point lead. However, Arizona will be bolstered by the expected return of quarterback Khalil Tate, who stood out on a national scale after exploding onto the scene midway through the 2017 season.
Unlike this season, USC will enjoy a bye in 2018. The lack of a bye was a thorn in the side of the Trojans from the start of the season. As injuries continued to pile up, coaches and players stressed that the lack of break — paired with a short turnaround on a road game in Pullman, Wash., to play Washington State — was one of the more difficult factors of the season. The team will host Colorado coming off its break on Oct. 13. The Trojans clinched the Pac-12 South title with a 38-24 victory over the Buffaloes last weekend.
After taking on Colorado, head coach Clay Helton will set his sights on a trip to Utah (the Trojans squeaked by the Utes 28-27 at home last month), before welcoming Arizona State to the Coliseum, when USC will look for a repeat of this season’s 48-17 blowout victory in Tempe.
The Trojans travel to Corvallis, Ore., for the first time since 2013 after facing the Sun Devils. USC breezed by Oregon State 38-10 this year, and it will host Cal after facing the Beavers. Finally, the Trojans wrap up the regular season with back-to-back rivalry games — first at the Rose Bowl versus UCLA, then a tilt at the Coliseum against Notre Dame.
If USC returns to the Pac-12 Championship, the title game will take place in Santa Clara on Nov. 30.

Early on, it’s been a tale of two narratives for the No. 10 men’s basketball team.
In USC’s season-opener against Cal State Fullerton (0-2), the Trojans looked like a top-10 team nationally, as they routed and doubled up the Titans in dominant fashion, 84-42.
But in USC’s most recent showing, they appeared to struggle to surmount a scrappy, and possibly overlooked, North Dakota State (0-2) team. Ultimately, USC mounted a 24-9 run to finish regulation before coming away with the 75-65 victory over the Bison this past Monday. Unlike the win over Fullerton, the performance against North Dakota State did not feel like that of a top-10 team.
“It was good to see our team be able to pull out a late rally and come away with a win like that (against North Dakota State),” said senior guard Jordan McLaughlin, who scored 12 points against the Bison. “But it’s still a lesson to us. You can’t come out and give anyone a chance to beat you. You’ve got to come out playing hot.”
USC will continue its non-conference schedule as it takes on Vanderbilt this Sunday in what will be the team’s first road trip of the season.
The Commodores have split their first two games of the regular season, and are coming off a 69-60 loss to Belmont on Monday. Vanderbilt will host UNC Asheville on Friday before taking on the Trojans at home on Sunday.
USC’s first Power-5 opponent of the regular season will be Vanderbilt this Sunday. Vanderbilt, which has qualified for the NCAA Tournament the past two seasons, returns three of its four top scorers from last season. Sunday’s matchup between the Trojans and Commodores will be the first time the two programs play one another since the 1975 season.
“We’re looking forward to the first road trip,” junior forward Chimezie Metu said. “[Vanderbilt] is a good team who plays in a strong conference. It’s a good early test for us that will help us be ready for the later games this season.”
In USC’s win over North Dakota State this past Monday, junior forward Bennie Boatwright recorded a career-high 28 points. Boatwright is the team’s leading scorer through two games this season (20.5 points per game).
“[Boatwright’s] improved in the offseason,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “He’s more explosive, he’s quicker and he’s a year older.”
USC’s season-opening victory over Fullerton saw Metu record his first double-double of the season. Metu totaled a game-high 18 points (7-of-14), and a game-high 10 rebounds.
Last season saw Metu lead the team in rebounds, averaging 7.8 rebounds per game. The trend has continued, as Metu leads USC in rebounds through two games this season (8.5 rebounds per game).
In the paint, Metu will have to deal with Vanderbilt senior forward Jeff Roberson this Sunday. Roberson, who is averaging a double-double through two games this season (13 points, 11 rebounds), is the Commodores’ primary weapon in the paint.
Sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton, who has not played in any of the Trojans’ games thus far due to what the team has called an eligibility issue, will reportedly be held out again against Vanderbilt.   
“We’re very hopeful that he will be back out there as soon as possible,” Enfield said when asked about a possible return date for Melton.
Melton, who started last season for USC, is being held out in the wake of the team’s involvement in an FBI investigation on associate head coach Tony Bland, in which Bland allegedly facilitated payments to two USC players or recruits.
The Trojans look to get off to a strong start on the road this weekend against Vanderbilt. Last season’s USC team went 6-5 on the road.
“Vanderbilt was an NCAA Tournament team, and it’s always a tough place to play at,” Enfield said. “We’re excited to see if we can go and get a quality win on the road.”

The men’s volleyball team will wrap up its preseason play at the UCLA Fall Tournament this weekend. The Trojans will face off against three teams, including the Bruins, in the tournament at the Wooden Center.
The weekend will start with a match against UC Santa Barbara on Friday. The Gauchos went 10-16 last season, struggling against top-tier competition and dropping their final five games of the season. The teams faced each other twice last season. In the first meeting, the Gauchos surprised the Trojans in a hard-fought 3-2 match. USC bounced back in the second meeting, claiming a 3-0 victory.
On Saturday, the Trojans will face off against Cal State Northridge. The Matadors went 12-15 last season, playing the Trojans twice. Similarly to UC Santa Barbara, Cal State Northridge came out strong and swept USC in a 3-0 victory in the teams’ first meeting. The Trojans returned a month later and battled for a 3-2 win, leaving the teams level at 1-1 on the season.
Following the game against Cal State Northridge, the team will face UCLA for a preseason rivalry match. The Bruins were 17-10 last season, and finished ranked No. 6 in the AVCA Division Coaches’ rankings. The rivals met twice last season, and the Bruins came away victorious both times. In the first meeting, UCLA won 3-1. The second came late in the season, with UCLA sweeping USC 3-0.
Previously, the Trojans went 1-5 in the USC Fall Tourney, a tournament the team hosts at the Galen Center each year. USC split teams for the tournament, notching a solo victory over Concordia in a 3-0 sweep. However, the Trojans fell to Cal State Northridge, Grand Canyon, Stanford, UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara in three sets. The tournament allowed for third sets to be optional, but the Trojans took the extra set each time for experience.
After the UCLA Fall Tournament, the regular season will officially begin for the Trojans with a non-conference home matchup with Princeton at the Galen Center. The team will then travel to Hawaii for the Texaco Rainbow Warrior Classic, facing off against Juniata, Stevens Institute and Hawaii.
