A window on the USC Hillel building was shattered sometime between Monday at 9:45 p.m. and Tuesday at 9 a.m., sparking speculation on social media platforms about whether the damage was the result of an antisemitic act. The Department of Public Safety is looking into the incident, but a motive has not yet been determined and the incident has yet to be characterized.
Hillel members discovered the broken window adjacent to the entry door to the building, which stands on the Hoover Pedestrian Mall, Tuesday morning. In a statement to the University’s Jewish community Tuesday afternoon, executive director of USC Hillel Dave Cohn wrote that DPS launched an investigation within a half hour of the building opening, and it remains unclear whether the damage sustained was accidental, an act of indiscriminate vandalism or a targeted attack on the facility.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University confirmed that it is aware of the incident and that DPS is “taking it very seriously.” Any community member with information about the damage should contact DPS. 
The Hillel building has security video monitoring in place, Cohn said in an interview with the Daily Trojan, and the organization will be cooperating fully with DPS. DPS did not provide comment as to the status of the investigation.
Twitter users took to assessing and commenting on the situation Tuesday, with one user writing, “Horrifying – the Hillel Jewish center at @USC has been vandalized.” Another user wrote of the incident, “This is unacceptable. I hope whoever did this is caught and prosecuted.” 
Cohn said that while the motive behind the damage is not yet known, he appreciates the “expressions of concern” USC Hillel has received since the incident.
“It’s perfectly valid in the wake of this type of incident and the sense of vulnerability and jeopardy it creates to see the types of images that were going around on social media — [the incident] isn’t something we take lightly,” Cohn said. “We know that this is a precarious time in the world, one where antisemitism, unfortunately, is an all too real experience phenomenon in the world, and we have every measure of respect for the urgency of addressing it.”
Upon discovering the damage, Cohn said his first concern was ensuring that Hillel would be able to continue operating without disruption. On account of the Hillel professional team and DPS’ quick response, Cohn said, Hillel events took place the same day. 
“It was really heartening to see how as the day continued on Tuesday, we saw students coming to Hillel for meetings, coming to Hillel to socialize and to spend time together,” Cohn said.
USC Hillel president Zach Gordon said he hasn’t felt that students and community members at Hillel feel vulnerable or unsafe since the incident happened. Foot traffic has been normal, he said, and everyone is excited for the organization’s welcome events. 
Gordon, a senior majoring in economics/mathematics and psychology, said he’s not rushing to call any judgements or characterize the incident until DPS releases the results of its investigation.
“We can definitely understand people’s concerns and skepticism about the event, but it’s really tough to start talking about certain positions without more information about the incident, so I think it’s best to wait until the report really gets finalized before action gets taken,” Gordon said.
When Logan Barth, a sophomore majoring in law, history and culture, saw news of the damage on social media, he said he felt “disgusted.” Barth, who served as the freshmen engagement fellow for Fresh Fest — the orientation program for incoming Jewish students — attends Hillel’s Shabbat dinners almost every Friday night. He said he believed what he saw to be vandalism on an important place for USC’s Jewish community. 
“A lot of people consider [Hillel] a safe space they can go to to do their homework, go to Shabbat dinners, so just seeing that it was vandalized, I was just disgusted and sad,” Barth said.
Many Jewish people he knows are talking about the incident, Barth said, because they all frequent the Hillel building. When he heard of it, he said he didn’t want to immediately characterize the incident as an act of antisemitism.
“When you jump to something saying it’s antisemitism, when we don’t really know if it is, it kind of discounts true instances of antisemitism,” Barth said.
He first saw the photos of the incident on the Instagram page @jewishoncampus, in a post that deemed the damage vandalism. The post also referenced the recent Department of Education investigation into antisemitism at USC, which was launched after a complaint filed in 2020 alleged the University mishandled the antisemitism directed toward former student and Undergraduate Student Government vice president Rose Ritch. 
The day the damage was discovered coincided with the release of the Advisory Committee on Jewish Life’s final report, a comprehensive document detailing recommendations for supporting Jewish life and Jewish students at USC. 
“[Tuesday] was an important day that we should be commemorating as an important milestone in how our campus models the way, so I hope that’s something that we’re able to focus on as the as the dust settles and as we work through the process of following up to what took place at Hillel,” Cohn said.

Minju Lee, a sophomore in the world bachelor in business program, shares the dream of many other international students of wanting to stay in the United States for work after graduation. With the Marshall School of Business’s announcement of all undergraduate degrees receiving STEM-designation, this dream can become more of a reality.
In a schoolwide email sent on July 8, Marshall’s Vice Dean for Undergraduate Programs Raman Randhawa announced that all of their undergraduate degrees, including accounting, business administration — including all emphases — business of cinematic arts and world bachelor in business students, will receive STEM-designation upon graduation.
Randhawa said that the STEM-designation is a “recognition of the strong technical and quantitative focus of our degree programs,” which Marshall hopes will encourage more prospective students and distinguish their students in the eyes of employers. 
“I feel like if you have the STEM recognition, you’re basically telling the recruiter that ‘I have received some systematic training from the school,’” said Serena Chen, a junior majoring in accounting. “I think it gives more credibility and then they trust that if you have the degree, it sends the message that you did something in your school that helped prepare you for technology or STEM fields.”
The U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics compiled a list of STEM topics that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses to approve academic programs to receive STEM designation.
“I feel like accounting can be STEM but it’s kind of weird that business administration is a part of STEM major since it doesn’t really require any scientific stuff,” said Merton Li, a junior majoring in business administration. “From the [current] business administration core classes, there really aren’t any STEM-related classes besides statistics. I see what Marshall was doing here, but I feel like certain concentrations can be in STEM. But if students aren’t taking those classes, I don’t think they deserve to be receiving a STEM major degree.”
Marshall has gradually developed their curriculum, so when the school applied to receive the STEM-designation, it was already meeting standards without needing to make any significant changes. 
“We’re preparing students, not just for the first job but to work with ideas,” said assistant professor of clinical marketing Lars Perner. “Specific knowledge becomes obsolete very quickly, but how can you start out in a career path in a way where you adapt over time and try to innovate as you need to.”
Marshall students can explore the different courses that pertain to their interests that were not previously STEM-designated courses, said Danny Chen, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
“I’ve always heard from other business students that they have to choose the finance emphasis in the past because they needed STEM to have this visa and to be able to work in the states for a longer time,” Danny said. “But then, they might have a bigger interest [in] marketing or entrepreneurship. I think now that everything is sorted out, they can do what they want.”
The distinction will be especially important because it allows international students to apply for a STEM OPT extension once they complete their degree, allowing them to stay for an additional 24 months of work experience after receiving an employment authorization document, for a total of 36 months of total work eligibility in the U.S. following graduation. 
“I think it’s just great for USC to have that option because it definitely does make the University more attractive to a lot of international students,” said Alyssa Manik, a senior majoring in accounting and business administration. “I think [this distinction] makes USC into a more international student-friendly university.”
With the STEM OPT extension, students are able to have an additional 60 days of unemployment during the extension period, allowing students to have more time to find work.
“Fortunately, the company that I’m currently working with already sponsors with visa, but H-1B is a lottery,” Manik said.  “But, since it’s three years now of lottery, I think it seems unlikely for me to not get [the H-1B visa] at all, so that kind of opens up a lot of options in terms of setting up career plans for the long term, like if I wanted to stay here for a while.” 
The STEM-designation allows students like Lee to stay to work in the U.S., allowing them to get hands-on experience in their chosen field. 
“Right now, I’m into real estate, so I did an internship here and maybe after graduation,” Lee said. “If I have access to the STEM visa, the barrier of a company sponsoring me as an international worker is going to be lower since I have a guarantee that I can stay in the States thanks to the [STEM-designation].”

Welcome to Los Angeles, Trojans — the city made up of top tier universities, A-list celebrities, sunny skies and burning hot asphalt. 
Whether you’re hauling yourself onto campus after a two hour commute or a five minute bike ride, it never hurts to get a quick refresher on why the California driver’s license, especially for those who drive in L.A., should be considered valid around the world. 
Everything here is relayed by a matter of time, not distance.
If time is money, think of streets and freeways in L.A. as those fun slot games that let you blow off a bit of steam and let loose a little. Except, let’s remove all the fun parts and emphasize sprinkles of pain, frustration and grief. Even when mapping out where to run to next when you have back-to-back classes, we often think of the trip in a matter of minutes, hoping that the teaching assistant or professor isn’t a stickler on time if we know that we might slip in a bit late.
Same thing applies for when you’re on the road. A trip to Santa Monica from USC can vary greatly, depending not only on the mode of transportation you choose to take but also the time of day you choose to go. Driving on the I-10 West Freeway in the morning can be twice as long compared to taking the same exact freeway in the afternoon, or even better, an hour after you had originally chosen to go. 
There’s always a way to get where you need to go.
I’ll admit, this place is no New York City or Seoul or Paris — with their fancy trains and buses and incredibly comprehensive public transportation systems — by any means. However, that’s not to say that you’re gridlocked to a few miles around campus. Traveling to other parts of the city and Los Angeles County can definitely be a bit confusing at first, but once you map down a route with the Big Blues, Metro Rapids, Metro slows, rainbow-colored train lines, bikes, steps and transportation-galore to certain places, you’ll know city transportation like the back of your hand. 
Maintain your ride.
This can often be taken as a point aimed towards solely the sedan and four-door crew; however, every commuter can take this to heart. Unless you are a literal hellspawn, you should never litter on public transportation. If you’re carpooling or car-sharing, treat the owner’s vehicle with a great deal of respect. It’s not hard to take a few extra steps to pick up your trash or not dent your buddy’s convertible. 
If we’re talking about a car or bike, the same thing applies. Have your insurance and registration always handy. Even the safest of drivers cannot avoid the most dangerous of lunatics. 
And don’t forget to do your timely oil changes, smog checks, headlight fluid replacements — the usual. 
The More, Usually the Merrier.
As the title of this column suggests, use the carpool lane — legally. Commuting with friends when you travel to new and unfamiliar places makes the whole adventure thing more worthwhile. For my fellow Angelenos, prepare to be poached as the tour bus, takeout person, Uber/Lyft or U-Haul for your friends and classmates. Gas has been pretty generous lately given a bit of legislation, albeit certainly not the $3 our parents were afforded when we were growing up, so don’t be afraid to charge a bit if the money is tight or the travel is far.
Play it safe.
On a more serious note, vehicular accidents, an avoidable disease that has taken countless lives, have always plagued this city. Don’t contribute to it.
Often, the commute can bring out the worst in us: getting hangry on the way to a restaurant while stuck in traffic, fighting in the car over a missed turn or being peeved over someone playing their music a little bit too loud.
Road rage — or even the anger that comes from commuting — can become an incredibly real, vivid experience, which may translate to regrettable action. It can be a culmination of all the issues that you may experience if you live a bit away from campus: FOMO, skipping events, waking up early, paying for extra commuter fees, etc. Recognize that those around you, whether or not they contributed to your rageful mindset, should not have to be at risk for losing their lives — nor should you. 
Making your commute can definitely take a good chunk of time, but always remember why you’re making the trip in the first place. Might as well make it worthwhile.
Get home safe, Trojans.
Lois Angelo is a senior writing about the perks, downsides and necessities of the commuter lifestyle in his column, “The Carpool Lane.”

The Undergraduate Student Government held its first senate meeting of the semester Tuesday night, where speaker of the senate Alvaro Flores shared this semester’s mission: increasing senate visibility by holding weekly tabling events on Trousdale Parkway, streamlining resources to be more accessible for students and successfully implementing additional projects. 
Senator Maria Barun announced her work continuing former senator Diego Andrades’ project of trying to integrate the USC ID card to the Apple Wallet. 
“Apple is all good on their side and is ready to help us integrate,” Barun said. “We’re currently working with USCard services… and I would like to say that this can be implemented by the end of the semester.”
Senators Yoav Gillath, Divya Jakatdar and Michelle Lu have also been working on bringing halal and kosher options to USC. The University officially endorsed the Jewish advisory committee’s recommendations for bringing kosher foods to the dining hall Tuesday.
“There are a lot of people with dietary restrictions that have a very difficult time finding healthy and affordable food on campus,” Jakatdar said. “Mental and physical well-being is difficult to secure without proper and available food.”
Senators Sanjana Sambhwani and Navya Singh are also working on opening a 24-hour dining option on campus.
“Personally, this idea originated from last year as someone who studied very late in libraries,” Singh said. “Insomnia Cookies didn’t open in the Village until later through the spring semester, so that idea stayed in the back of my head.” 
USG also plans to be more outward facing, and wants to help other students pitch their own projects.
“Ask not what USC can do for you, but what you can do for USC,” Flores said. “I really would encourage the student body to come to us with all kinds of project proposals because we’re here to help you.” 
During the meeting, advocacy liaison Taylor Clanton, a senior majoring in public policy, asked about USG’s plans in regards to students who say that USG is not doing anything. 
“When someone’s drowning, I’m going be ready to go out and help,” Gillath said. “I think that’s what our senate is going to try to do, to try and be very action oriented, and we’re going to try and actually get out there and help people.” 
Following up, USG legislative aide for external affairs Bradley Furgerson, a senior majoring in neuroscience and East Asian languages and cultures, asked about what efforts USG will be making to bring in students that don’t fall under the USG umbrella, as most senate meeting attendees are members of USG. 
“There’s a reason why students aren’t reaching out to us and that means that we’re unapproachable and inaccessible,” president Hannah Woodworth said. “So we’re going to do qualitative interviews… we want to find and track measurable data as to why this is happening.” 
Jakatdar also said that they plan to approach professors to ask if they can give a short speech about what USG is in their classes. 
Prior to this discussion, vice president Nivea Krishnan started the meeting with the organization’s first land acknowledgment.
Three elections commissioner candidates, David Mkrtchian, a senior majoring in economics; Jane Lee, a senior majoring in journalism; and Candice Lee, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and law and data science, were unanimously approved.
“My mission as an elections commissioner is to create a welcoming environment where all students of USC can feel a safe place to make their voices heard,” Jane said. “I hope to be a part of an inclusive and diverse body of members with the goal of helping all USC students.”
The senate unanimously approved Courtney Azari, a senior majoring in political science, as the chief justice of the judicial council,  and Rianna Rios, a senior majoring in public policy, as the senior executive aide. 
Flores gave a recap on what USG covered during their summer meetings in the inter-semester meeting reporting, which included appointing the programming committees, introducing and approving the budget and amending their constitution and bylaws. 
A previous version of this article stated that Courtney Azari is a junior. Azari is a senior. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

With USC’s Common App open once again, thousands of students are grappling with the limited range of options for the race question. According to the Wall Street Journal, the most agonizing question on a college application consists of four words: “What is your race?” And to this day, on any application, it’s the question I dread the most.
As a previous Common App applicant, I was taken aback when I did not see any references, allusions or even any indications of a Middle Eastern or North African category on the application. This was especially jarring after just completing the UC application, where I was boldly and proudly able to identify with my true racial identity. Every year, on forms such as the Common App, thousands of Middle Eastern and North African Students have to choose races that do not represent their reality or lived experiences as an unacknowledged invisible minority.
Due to historical reasons stemming from U.S. citizenship discrimination against people of color, the MENA community had to fight for naturalization, and their only spear was to persuade the U.S. government was that they were of white descent. This strategy was adopted by many immigrants including those of Syrian, Lebanese and Mexican backgrounds.  To this day, the U.S. Census continues to classify MENA individuals as white regardless of the ceaseless efforts pushing to add a MENA category to the census. The resounding reality is that MENA individuals, such as myself, are classified as white but without the many privileges of whiteness, and it continues to cause resounding problems within the MENA community. This is particularly evident in the lack of statistics and transparent data on the MENA population, resulting in a lack of health research, community funding and programs such as language assistance to newly arrived refugees and immigrants.
This past summer, I applied for a radiology volunteer program and the form lacked a racial option I could identify with. I emailed the program coordinator about the issue, and it was a victorious moment when my email finally made a difference, and the program coordinator added a MENA Category. This experience made me dream wilder and envisage a day where all USC forms and the Common App would also include MENA and other racial categories. 
However, it seems like I have been clutching at straws trying to reach the right person in the Undergraduate Student Admissions at USC. I have sent email after email, made call after call, hoping someone would direct me to the right person to change the status quo and end this cycle of incorrect racial reportage. 
Part of what’s kept me motivated is knowing the omission of the MENA category from official forms doesn’t just affect me but so many other students as well. As my brother applied this cycle he chose to racially identify as “White and Black” on the USC Common App Form due to the lack of a MENA category present. This confusion leads students who identify as “Middle Eastern North African” to choose Black, white, Asian and our favorite by far, “Other.”
This results in data that will only contribute to misinformation in the University’s census and monetary expenditure. The most conspicuous implications of the lack of racial recognition on the University census are integrated into USC’s student health services and professional programs. For instance, due to the absence of a MENA or North African category, there is an absence of culturally-specific and competent therapy appointments for these students within the USC counseling and mental health services. The USC Mental Health and Counseling Office boasts multiple culturally-specific therapy programs where students meet with a therapist that shares the same cultural background as them. These appointments can be made through “the Student Equity and Inclusion Programs: APASS, CBCSA, La CASA, LGBTQ+ Student Center and First Gen+ Success Center.” This lack of a MENA category is inextricably linked to the absence of a USC MENA Alumni Association leaving students without a dedicated space to foster connections with people of a shared background and without resources that other groups have.
Looking at the UC and the CSU application, I unequivocally believe that there is hope for change at USC. In 2009, students pushed, the UC Application to “expand terms of ethnic identification.” The result of this unity was the expansion of the UC application’s racial identification boxes to include sub-categories within each race ranging from Middle Eastern to South Asian to North African, making students heard and seen. 
The lack of racial recognition in university forms and the Common App will continue to strip students of their racial identity. If you wish for a more inclusive USC with equitable resources and accountable minority funding, sign the petition to push for the inclusion of more racially inclusive categories including a MENA category on all USC Forms and especially the Common App. 
Only our unity can make change possible.

We’re back. For me, the beginning of the fall semester brings a lot of “lasts.” I already had my last first day of classes. I’m looking forward to next week’s football home opener against Rice University, which will also be my last. And I suppose this is my last opening column of the semester. 
Last year I began this column writing about stadiums such as SoFi and Climate Pledge Arena seeking to host events in more sustainable ways. I went on to talk about athletes endorsing cryptocurrencies and pollution affecting athletes’ health. These stories certainly won’t be the last time sports and climate change make headlines – so I wanted to keep talking about them.
Sports can and have served as an outlet for athletes to voice their concerns about the rapidly deteriorating ozone layer and humankind’s role in the climate crisis. Furthermore, professional sports organizations, particularly those run by billionaires with money invested in coal and oil, must adapt their practices in order to decrease their carbon emissions and do their part in mitigating climate change. 
An unfortunate reality of climate change is that, at an individual level, we can only do so much – ultimately, the carbon footprints of corporate giants outdo the actions of everyday people as the climate crisis grows exponentially more dire. 
SportsArt, an exercise equipment company, is at the forefront of a unique opportunity to use exercise to save energy at a local level.
SportsArt machines harness the energy stored when someone uses an elliptical machine or stationary bike and pumps it back into the building’s power grid in an effort to offset the building’s electrical usage. By using an AC current to send the power back into the building’s grid, SportsArt’s method doesn’t require intensive installation. One simple plugs in an elliptical or bike, starts working out and  instantly creating energy that the building can use instead of relying on more harmful ways of obtaining energy such as natural gas. 
It’s a fantastic concept, and one that has many climate advocates intrigued. In a world where everyone uses oil and gas and throws away plastics and other harmful materials, SportsArt’s technology offers a chance for the average gym-goer to contribute to a human-harnessed energy economy. 
And should you need extra motivation on a long bike ride, SportsArt even displays how many watts the user is producing in real time. Some gyms, such as Sacramento Eco Fitness are already incentivizing going that extra mile, offering tiered discounts to members depending on how many watts they produce. 
If there has ever been a no-brainer, grandslam, touchdown idea, it’s this one. While SportsArt equipment is expensive, there is potential for a return on investment with a lowered electricity bill. There are thousands of gyms across the country and hundreds of thousands in the world. Additionally, buildings make up for 30-40% of all energy consumption. Unlike wind or solar energy, which require vast amounts of land and expensive construction projects, there is already plenty of real estate in the world that can play host to this equipment. It’s just an issue of replacement. 
Unfortunately, energy-generating bikes or ellipticals cannot save the world. A one-hour workout might produce enough energy to power a laptop for a couple of hours, but the decision to include more energy-producing exercise equipment is something that all gyms (looking at you, Lyon Center) should consider. Such equipment saves money every year and serves as a reminder for each person using it that, albeit small, everyone has a role in combating climate change. 
One can hope that over time the technology will improve to incorporate human-burned energy even more efficiently. While the bucket of carbon and methane gasses that have been released into the atmosphere is already overflowing, and it feels overly simplified to say that every drop counts, I’ll still say it – every drop counts when it comes to climate change. While we must continually push for corporations and large companies to reduce their carbon footprint, we must also find value and meaning in reducing our own carbon emissions.

Over the summer, the USC Athletic Department named former Major League Baseball player and Grand Canyon University manager Andy Stankiewicz the new USC baseball head coach. The move followed the Trojans’ last-place finish in the Pac-12 in 2022. 
The Daily Trojan spoke with Coach Stankiewicz to discuss his goals as head coach at USC.
Daily Trojan: First of all, welcome to USC. I would love to know what it means to you to be joining the Trojan family and how it felt when you learned you were the new manager here.
Andy Stankiewicz: Well, exciting, very exciting. You know, being raised in Southern California… in the ‘70s and ‘80s you dreamt of, you know, going to SC — and I was a decent athlete. I had aspirations to play football as well, but I realized quickly that probably wouldn’t work. So, shifting gears to baseball, to come back home some 30, 40 years later to be named head coach at  University of Southern California Baseball, it’s a big moment for me and my family and I’m extremely excited about being here.
D.T: [You’re] a SoCal native, and I saw you went to Pepperdine University. So, is it more special to be coming back to L.A. after spending a long time in both Phoenix and in the minors and now leading the Trojans again?
A.S: Yeah, it is cool. You know, you circle back around, never know where and when life is going to take you. It just goes and you go with it. The next thing you know, I’m getting an opportunity to come back home. I still have family here, I’ve always felt like Southern California is kind of home. Coming back home is exciting because, you know, you’re born and raised here and then you get away and you’re always kind of like… ‘I’d love to get back to SoCal because it’ll always be home.’ And so to be able to come back home and then to be the head coach at SC, it’s like a double bonus, man. I’m thrilled. 
D.T: Talking about your time at GCU, you were obviously quite successful there, winning five conference titles and Coach of the Year four times. How do you hope and how will you be able to continue that success now here in the Pac-12 with USC?
A.S: Well, I’m going to need support. I need support from the incoming administration. And that is something that I felt right out of the gate when I met with [USC Athletic Director] Mike Bohn and [Associate Athletic Director] Lindsay Jaffe. I just felt like, man, starting from the top, I feel like there’s going to be all this support that we were going to need to move the program well and quickly. Another part is getting a coaching staff that I feel like could help us… restore SC. I feel like the coaching staff that we’ve been able to put together quickly is as good as any in the country. Travis Jewett has been a recruiting coordinator at Arizona State University, Vanderbilt University, head coach at Tulane University. Randy [Flores] is a hitting coach because his offensive coaching is good out there. Then to bring Seth Etherton back home again — obviously, a great Trojan in his own right. You know, [Etherton] was a part of the 1998 College World Series team. I think all that and then the staff that we have in place, I think it’s going to be as good as we can possibly imagine. It is a big part of it. I mean… you have to make some moves before players even get here, right? So, when they arrive at the end of this month, they see that there’s structure in place – there’s organization. There’s going to be attention to detail. So these guys are going to be a huge help for us to kind of put all those necessary things in place for the program.
D.T: You’re mentioning how it is important to have a foundation before going out and recruiting a lot of players. What has recruiting been like now for USC since you’ve joined? Is it different than your time at GCU? And additionally, have the NIL deals had a bigger play into any of recruiting now?
A.S: Well, it’s similar. When I started at Grand Canyon, everyone was kind of like, ‘Okay, what’s going to go on there? What’s going to change?’ I think that there’s a little bit of a really cool buzz about what we’re doing, what we’ve been able to, like I said the guys that are in place. But, you know, the truth of the matter [is], there’s still the unknown. Okay, how are they going to compete? What are they going to do? So right now, I got to find young men that want to be a part of something to restore. There’s other programs that have had success, but, hey man, we’re SC, and we’re going to turn this quickly. So, it has a little bit of a feel to where I was early at Grand Canyon in that respect, like, okay, we got to kind of rebuild the structure a little bit, right? So, I think that’s what this early part is going to be about. Now, don’t make any mistakes here, we’re going to win. We’re going to compete well. We’re going to teach them how to play good baseball. We’re gonna teach them to be great teammates. We’re going to build all those foundational dynamics to a ball club. But, I think people are just excited. At the same time, it’s our job to show them that they should be excited for a good reason and be excited for the long haul, not just for a short moment, right?
D.T: Obviously, USC’s baseball program the last few years has not been to the standard of USC athletics for a lot of other sports. They haven’t made it to the NCAA tournament in several years. But you, on the other hand, have led the Antelopes in Grand Canyon to the postseason many times over your tenure there. Will we see the Trojans make the postseason? 
A.S: You know, our goal is to win a national title. I mean anything less is falling short. You know, you look at that left field wall at Dedeaux [Field], it says 12, right? 12 being 12 national titles, the most of [any team in Division 1 baseball]. So I’m fully aware of that, our coach is fully aware of that. I feel a responsibility. I feel an obligation to the University. I feel an obligation to the alumni. I feel an obligation to Los Angeles to win a national title. You know, if you’re a competitive person, that’s the goal. So, I’m not saying that’s going to happen next year, but I’m saying that we’re going to rebuild and restore the foundation and program that can be on a competitive level year in and year out. I think that, when you look at the great programs in college, what they do is they’re consistently in the postseason. Step one is to get to the postseason, and then step two is always being in the postseason. Once you get to that point, well you put yourself in a position to compete for national titles. So, that’s certainly the goal.
D.T: You’ve had a very successful baseball career starting from playing in the majors to coaching the minor leagues and then some college runs just most recently with Grand Canyon. What does it mean to you now to be this manager and what does mentoring and being the leader to these young new years of baseball talent mean to you to give back to the game?
A.S: Well, I take a lot of pride in it, Joey. I just respect this position tremendously. I respect coach [Rod] Dedeaux. I respect coach [Mike] Gillespie, which I played for two summers. He was a mentor to me and a young man two summers in Alaska and a big influence in my life getting back into the college game now. He is the person I called when I was done with my playing career, “Hey coach, what do you think? Should I get back into college?” He had a big impact on my life and I think about what he did for me and I want to do this and do this for these young men as well. I want them to feel like someone’s in their corner and not just baseball-wise, but life-wise.
D.T: I’m sure. Yeah. I mean, any career where you actually make it to the big show, I’m sure there’s a lot of adversity that you have gone through.
A.S: Yeah. And so I think that, you know, it’s not easy, man. What these young men are trying to do is to be great baseball players and be students and be great citizens and be great teammates. There’s a lot of things that go into this and so we want to be able to share all that with them… More than anything, I want the players to know I got their back, man. I’m in the corner with them and that’s what we gotta show them right out the gate.

Written to be an exotic thriller and award show contender, “Bullet Train” succeeds in neither area. The audience follows Ladybug (Brad Pitt), an unlucky assassin who’s about to get the ride of his life. Adorned with “Street Fighter”-esque aesthetics and homages to Jackie Chan, “Bullet Train” is a misguided attempt at what white men think Asian movies are. 
“Bullet Train” attempts what many critics predict the second season of “Squid Game” will be: a full cast of established actors in subversive roles too tastefully niche to be mainstream. The similarities wouldn’t just end there.
From the trailers, the marketing team made clear the movie would be centered around a singular space. Instead of large childhood playgrounds, each scene was contained within the train’s cars, a familiar challenge for many amateur screenwriters trying to write the next “Murder on the Orient Express.”
Though I have a particular affinity toward mindless television, a movie with a $90 million budget should not have left me feeling so indifferent. The strong performances and tight pacing were unable to suspend disbelief around the ambiguity of major plot devices. The usual tricks of bright color usage, snarky one-liners and slapstick humor felt like scraps from the cutting room floor of another David Lietch movie, “Deadpool 2.” 
If the visual effects team had pulled back on gore with the same ruthlessness they had on Joey King’s hairline, this movie would’ve been nearly palatable. Mothers who  once dreamed of being Pitt’s Mrs. Smith were seen leaving the theater pearls clutched in hand. There’s something very peculiar about an action movie that seems to flaunt its share of the market: ensemble movies have always been destined for large box office numbers, but the film’s excessive usage of bodily fluids showed a near-intent in eliminating a large portion of their potential audience. Even with over a dozen fight scenes in just two hours, the dialogue was lengthy and broke the first rule of filmmaking: Show, don’t tell.
Throughout the first watch and every subsequent re-watch, my skepticism of the story’s location only continued to grow. Why was this movie set in Tokyo? As another failed entry in Hollywood’s inexplicable content remaking cycle, Lietch seemingly gives up on his studio-given task of interpreting “Maria Beetle,” Kōtarō Isaka’s popular Japanese novel which studio executives are keen to recreate. By replacing all but two characters with non-Japanese roles, the adaptation effectively erases any need for the Tokyo setting. Besides, wouldn’t the casting be much more appropriate for the westbound E-line? In an interview with Seventeen, King said, “I do not believe a white woman should play a character of color. Not me or any white woman for that matter.” And yet, the “The Kissing Booth” actress takes up the largest amount of screentime for a female character, all while playing a role meant for someone of Asian descent. How… exotic. 
Despite obvious efforts to be the next “Knives Out,” this movie falls closer to the inconsequential lull of “Don’t Look Up.” If this is what post-Tarantino filmmaking looks like, I’m not sure I want it. As a proponent of decentering the white male perspective as the default, I have a hard time enjoying a movie built on the very principles of pandering to Eurocentric standards. In addition to the insistence on graphic humor and the strong white-washing, the whole story seems to be presented with a lens of misogyny. The writing of the women portray them as weak, shallow and privy to digressive tangents. The men, written to be witty and himbo-like, come off as condescending and ignorant, so much so that I began to resent them.
The intention of creating social commentary through caricature-like personalities is such an obvious writing trope, and an offensive one at that. Pitt’s portrayal of his character’s pursuit of wellness lacked the genuinity it tried so desperately to evoke, leading to a borderline “Eat Pray Love”-level of cultural colonization. In a near-comical moment of method acting, Pitt and co-star Aaron Taylor-Johnson prayed for success for their movie at the Koyasan Tokyo Betsuin Temple as a part of the film’s press tour.
In the cultural zeitgeist of train movies, “Bullet Train” falls flat. The twists are too audience-aware, the inverted tropes too peddling. The film could’ve been something a disinterested theater student would’ve written in high school, although I don’t think even they would betray their standards this far. Very rarely have I found a movie so much like background noise, much less one I actually paid matinee prices for. For those wondering if their college schedule time and college student money is worth spending on an expensive blunder that tries so hard to live up to “Scott Pilgrim vs. The World,” I recommend you forgo taking this ride.

I’m a fan of all things “Moulin Rouge!,” and I visited the actual Moulin Rouge earlier this year in Paris. This summer, I saw a performance of  “Moulin Rouge!” at Hollywood’s Pantages Theater — a show I highly recommend, by the way, if you’re looking for something to do in Los Angeles. Being the narrative studies major that I am, I just had to figure out the differences and nuances of storytelling about the Moulin Rouge, so I ended up re-watching the 2001 film “Moulin Rouge!” starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor.
You might be thinking: none of these versions of the “Moulin Rouge!” have anything to do with animation or anything like that — they all have real people. That’s mostly true, except the fact that in the film, there’s a part where a seemingly animated green fairy version of Kylie Minogue flies around as an absinthe-induced hallucination.
Let’s back up a bit. For more context, I have to provide some basic summary.
The 2001 film “Moulin Rouge!,” directed by Baz Luhrmann, centers on the doomed love story between a young writer named Christian (McGregor) and a beautiful cabaret performer named Satine (Kidman). In the beginning, Christian arrives in Paris to participate in the Bohemian movement. While he’s there, he gets roped into a scheme by Bohemian Frenchman Toulouse (John Leguizamo) to sell Toulouse’s show to the Moulin Rouge. Christian is told to pitch the show to Satine, the Moulin Rouge’s star performer, and convince her of its potential.
The Moulin Rouge, however, is going bankrupt, and the performers need a big investment in order to sustain their livelihoods. Here comes the story’s primary antagonist: the Duke of Monroth (Richard Roxburgh). The Duke can provide that investment — at the cost of Satine’s free will. Smitten with Satine, the Duke wants her to be his.
The Moulin Rouge’s owner, Harold Zidler (Jim Broadbent), promises Satine to the Duke. The Duke is supposed to meet Satine in her dressing room, but then Christian arrives instead. Christian is mistaken for the Duke of Monroth and sings a love song for Satine. 
The two fall in love, but after it’s revealed that Christian is just a poor writer, the two must keep their relationship secret in order to avoid risking the Duke’s investment to save the Moulin Rouge. At some point, it’s revealed that Satine is gravely ill. At the end of the film, the Duke is defeated, but just as the two lovers reunite, Satine dies.
As a whole, the story is pretty tragic. There are moments, though, where the film is a celebration of the bohemian spirit. The scene in question — the one that’s most relevant to the subject of “Animated” — is when Christian and Toulouse’s band of performers consume absinthe. As a result, they collectively begin to hallucinate. 
Part of that hallucination involves seeing the iconic “Green Fairy” (Kylie Minogue) who, of course, is a real person, but digitally rendered as a miniature sparkling green fairy, one that looks very much like Tinker Bell if the character was further sexualized. Mel Bondfield at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia writes that Minogue’s performance of the “Green Fairy” is “a blurring of the line between the playful innocence attributed to a fairytale character and the sex appeal of a captivating siren.” 
For me, the “Green Fairy” represents the dual sides of the Moulin Rouge in this movie. Sometimes the Moulin Rouge and its shows are an elaborate, wondrous spectacle. Other times the place is a dark reminder of the objectification of the performers’ bodies as part of that same spectacle. 
On another level, the “Green Fairy” appears to be a symbol of the period in Paris’ history captured in the film. The whole musical hallucination sequence seems just ridiculous at times, but there’s a certain kind of fantasy involved. If the “Green Fairy” is akin to a fairytale, then so is “Moulin Rouge!” as a love story. Needless to say, “Moulin Rouge!” is a celebration of the bohemian spirit: as the Bohemians sing in the film, it’s about living life with “freedom, beauty, truth and love.” 
Technically, though, I just wanted to look at the use of the “Green Fairy” in “Moulin Rouge!” to explore how animation, visual effects and/or digital arts as a whole can be used in subtle ways for live-action films. That play on a real person is a mirror for the central plot: the way that Satine seems to exist as a sexualized, unreal object for the Duke to possess. She is a fantasy for him. With the use of digital pixie dust for a real-life person, the movie seems to espouse those messages about the costs of being a performer on the stage and being a performer for life. 
“Moulin Rouge!” is about the concept of “performance” being magical. Through the motif of the show, the story looks at different themes from class division to feminine agency. It’s escapism and honesty all at once. As critics have written, “Moulin Rouge!” is campy—it pokes fun at shows while depicting one. As others write, it’s also full of “excess.” The “Green Fairy” is an element in which that comes to light. Since 2001, the “Green Fairy” symbol has taken on a life of its own, from being featured in “RuPaul’s Drag Race” season 14 to being written about in various thinkpieces across the Internet (like this one). 
Even if I can’t relate to the absinthe drinking that induced the fairy’s appearance, watching the film made me miss being at the Moulin Rouge in Paris — not so much the city, but how I felt while I was there. Not worrying about assignments, careers or my future, but just getting lost in the show, feeling like I was part of the magic.
