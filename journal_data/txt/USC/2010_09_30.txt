The No. 5 USC women’s volleyball team is undefeated so far this season, but it faces a big test this weekend when it plays its first conference games away from the Galen Center.

The Women of Troy will play the No. 10 Washington Huskies tonight before heading to Pullman, Wash., to compete against Washington State on Saturday. Both games will start at 7 p.m.
USC is coming off an impressive win against crosstown rival UCLA last Friday in four sets, which moved the Women of Troy to 1-0 in the Pac-10.
Despite his team’s success, USC coach Mick Haley is not overlooking either of this weekend’s games.
“I look for a very tough match at Washington and I don’t know what to expect at Washington State yet, so this is a hard trip for us,” Haley said. “This’ll tell us a bit more about this group.”
All season, USC has been able to celebrate the youth of its team, as six players on the current roster are freshmen. However, this could potentially prove to be a slight disadvantage against the Huskies.
“I think [the Huskies] are a bit more organized than we are at this point because they have the same players back,” Haley said, adding that Washington only has one new player in its starting lineup this year, and that player was a redshirt last season.
The last time the Women of Troy won in Seattle was 2004. Overall, USC has lost three of the last four matches against Washington.
Unlike the Huskies, Washington State’s season thus far has not put the Women of Troy on high alert. The Cougars are unranked and are 6-6 on the season, with a conference record of 0-2.
The Women of Troy, however, are not going to take their opponent lightly, knowing that the Cougars swept USC just last year in Pullman.
“It’s always tough playing in Pullman,” Haley said. “We have to travel on the same day that we play. We have to fly over to Pullman Saturday morning and then get ready to play that night, so it’s a really focused match for us.”
Haley did not get into too many specifics regarding either team, possibly because he does not want to put too much focus on the opponents. He would rather have his players concentrate on themselves, he said.
“I’m anxious to see how we do because that will let me know where we are and what to focus on,” Haley said. “But I really think we have to keep thinking about our side of the net and what we’re doing.”
In a conference where six teams are ranked and wins are hard to come by, Haley said he recognized how significant it would be for his team to come away with wins this weekend.
“One, it helps us, of course, with self confidence, but two, every one you can steal on the road gives you a better chance to finish higher in the conference,” Haley said. “It’s a tug of war. It just goes back and forth with all the teams like this.”

The Women of Troy (7-1-2)  were tested in their weekend road trip to the Pacific Northwest, but today they face an even greater test as they travel to San Diego (6-4-2) to square off against the Toreros, who handed them their lone loss of the season.
“Going into this game, we’re really serious,” said freshman midfielder Haley Boysen. “They embarrassed us on our home field, so we want to do the same.”
Tim Tran | Daily Trojan
The Toreros defeated the Women of Troy in their season opener at McAlister Field 1-0 back in August, but a lot has changed since then.
Although the Women of Troy carry a six-game winning streak into the match, the Toreros have struggled to string together any consistency this season.
Despite this, USC coach Ali Khosroshahin knows his team can’t overlook any opponent, as evidenced by its recent two-game road trip against opponents with losing records.
“You can’t take anybody lightly,” Khosroshahin said.  “In the sports world, on any given day, anybody can beat you.”
Slow starts have plagued the Women of Troy in back-to-back games, but the play of the freshmen has really helped give the team a lift.
Boysen, along with freshman midfielder Autumn Altamirano and freshman forward/midfielder Elizabeth Eddy, has filled up the box score in recent games, and all are playing integral roles in the team’s success.
“It’s taken them some time to figure out our style of play and how their style of play can mesh with our style, but I think they’re finally figuring it out,” Khosroshahin said.  “They’re very talented players and they’re only going to get better.”
On the other end of the field, freshman defender Mia Bruno and freshman goalkeeper Shelby Church have helped solidify a backline that continues to be the backbone for the team.
“Mia and Shelby have really stepped up,” Altamirano said. “Shelby has filled some big shoes and she’s doing really well … both are doing a really great job.”
Despite allowing early goals in consecutive games last weekend, the defense has held strong, limiting opponents’ opportunities and not allowing teams to score multiple goals this season.
Now that this is the second time facing the Toreros, Khosroshahin said he sees this game as a measuring stick as to how far the team has developed.
“We have an opportunity to measure the progress that we’ve made since the beginning of the season,” Khosroshahin said.  “Hopefully, we can get a good idea of where we are from where we were.”

So, parents, you’re in town to see your kids, right? You’ve missed them so much since the last time you saw them two months ago, you had to come visit them again in Los Angeles and take in the sights at USC.
Are you sure you didn’t have ulterior motives in mind? Ulterior motives such as a long-festering, burning desire to see Saturday’s high-profile football game between USC and Washington?
We’ll see about that. While you’re here and reading, though, here’s a few tidbits of information to keep you in the know for that event at the Coliseum. You know, the one you’ve been telling all your friends about. Let’s get to it.
This USC football team isn’t your elder child’s USC football team.
This one is sort of like your youngest child — one who has really, really big shoes to fill and is probably still too inexperienced to fill them. This child is also facing some remarkable circumstances that are outside of his control.
What kind of circumstances, you ask? Well, the Trojans are not eligible for postseason play for the next two years — making the 2010 and 2011 seasons essentially worthless. But they’re still undefeated this year — 4-0, in fact — and with that status comes big dreams.
Each week, USC coach Lane Kiffin posts a motivational piece of paper on the windows at Heritage Hall, USC’s athletic headquarters.
So far, it’s featured various pictures from the Rocky films, along with a list of USC’s wins this year and the remaining scheduled games. At the bottom of the page, the countdown of undefeated teams continues to dwindle.
“As of today, only 21 teams in the nation are 4-0,” this week’s flier said.
About Heritage Hall — if you haven’t seen it yet, check it out. That’s where all the news happens with USC sports and also where the school stores its many trophies.
You’ll notice the Trojans’ most recent Heisman Trophy — the one Reggie Bush won — is nowhere to be seen. The NCAA ordered the school to disassociate itself from everything Bush-related, and so new Athletic Director Pat Haden had the trophy removed.
I mentioned that Haden is new. You might remember the old athletic director, Mike Garrett — otherwise known as “Mr. Personality.” Garrett was unceremoniously removed from his post in July after 17 up-and-down years on the job, and Haden has very much impressed in his short time at the helm of the athletic department.
For the moms out there: He’s a former college and NFL quarterback and a Rhodes Scholar and has got quite a bit of charisma. Try not to get swept away.
Of course, Kiffin’s also new himself. At 35, he’s a lot younger than former coach Pete Carroll is — in fact, he’s young enough to be his son.
But Kiffin’s no-fun attitude is in sharp contrast to Carroll’s famously easygoing persona. I’ve been at just about every practice, game and media session since Kiffin got here in January, and I can count the times I’ve seen him smile on one hand.
So, about the football team: USC’s not that bad. Of course, we haven’t seen the Trojans play a legitimate squad yet this year — and I’m not entirely sure Washington qualifies as one either — but it appears as if this team does have certain cheerable attributes.
Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley has a great arm and an ability to make every throw. Running backs Dillon Baxter (freshman), Allen Bradford (senior) and Marc Tyler (redshirt junior) each offer a different look out of the backfield and receivers Ronald Johnson (senior) and Robert Woods (freshman) are both well-rounded student-athletes with a commendable will to succeed — and great athleticism and hands to boot.
Defensively, the team is inexperienced but filled with potential. The entire defensive line could very easily go on to pursure fruitful NFL careers, and all three linebackers — sophomore Devon Kennard and seniors Malcolm Smith and Michael Morgan — are smart and make calculated decisions on the field. Safety T.J. McDonald is already developing into a star as a sophomore — and his dad went to USC too, so he’s one of those legacy kids the school loves.
That’s about it, really. The game kicks off at 5 p.m. Saturday.
So enjoy … the weekend with your kids.

There is no rest for a team with NCAA championship aspirations.
If this weekend’s SoCal Tournament in Westwood unfolds as expected, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team (11-0) will face a few teams seeking retribution for early-season losses to the Trojans.
Triple threat · Junior two-meter Matt Burton and the Trojans put their seven straight SoCal Tournament championships on the line this weekend. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
Owners of seven consecutive SoCal Tournament crowns, the Trojans will begin their title defense against Redlands at 8 a.m. Saturday, followed by an afternoon matchup against either No. 8 Long Beach or No. 9 Pepperdine. Barring an upset, the Trojans will then face either No. 4 Stanford or No. 5 UC Santa Barbara on Sunday.
As to whether this streak of seven consecutive SoCal Tournament victories adds any pressure to a young team already trying to prove itself against all other NCAA programs, redshirt sophomore driver Michael Rosenthal seems unfazed.
“We’ve won it seven years in a row and we know that we can definitely win it again this year,” Rosenthal said. “The pressure isn’t to keep the streak alive; it’s more to keep proving that we’re No. 1 and that we’re still the team to beat.”
USC coach Jovan Vavic has stressed a simple, fundamental approach during practices this week. Perhaps in a move of strategic posturing, he has tried to deflect much of the hype surrounding the Trojans, saying he believes that they are still an underdog.
“I don’t think we are the favorite,” Vavic said. “We’re ranked No. 1, but I think UCLA is probably the favorite in this tournament. They’re playing at home, they’re an experienced team and they’ll have a big crowd in their favor.”
As for adjustments he expects teams to make for their rematches against the Trojans, Vavic said he is preparing for opponents to better defend two freshmen who were unknown quantities heading into the NorCal Tournament: two-meter Jeremy Davie, the team’s leading scorer, and driver Nikola Vavic.
When listing teams capable of winning this tournament, Vavic and his players disregarded few programs. Berkeley’s roster is complete with experienced talent, Stanford is underrated, LMU has elite goaltending, and UC Santa Barbara and UC Irvine have challenged the best teams in the NCAA. Undoubtedly, this NCAA field is balanced, especially among the top teams. Not to be forgotten, in both its victories against UCLA and Cal, USC won by a one-goal margin.
From a wider perspective, not only is this tournament an opportunity for USC to retain its No. 1 ranking, but also an opportunity for the team to position itself for the postseason.
“If we win this tournament and come out with an undefeated record, that pretty much puts NCAA’s within our hands because both Cal and UCLA would have to come to our pool and play us at home in order to take away any chance of our going to the NCAA’s,” said junior two-meter Matthew Burton. “With that in mind, it’s a huge tournament for us.”

Podcast: Sports editors James Bianchi and Kenny Legan size up the Huskies.
Last time USC faced Washington, it was the beginning of the end.
Taking charge · Sophomore quarterback Matt Barkley did not play in last season’s upset loss to the Huskies because of a shoulder injury, but will be ready to go in this season’s rematch. He is leading the nation with 12 touchdown passes in four games. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The Huskies’ shocking 16-13 upset victory over then-No. 3 USC started the Trojans on a downward spiral that culminated in a fifth-place Pac-10 finish, their worst in eight years.
The No. 18 Trojans (4-0) will be out to avenge that embarrassing loss Saturday when Washington (1-2) visits the Coliseum. Kickoff is scheduled for 5 p.m.
The revenge story line is the most pervasive. Returning players didn’t hide that they wanted to give the Huskies a little payback.
“We’ve had 365 days to think about this,” redshirt junior linebacker Chris Galippo said.
Any hopes for redemption must start with stopping Washington quarterback Jake Locker, who orchestrated a last-minute drive to get into field goal range and seal last year’s upset. Locker had been projected by some to be the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft, yet he has not lived up to expectations this season (see a particularly bad 4-of-20, 71-yard, two-interception outing against No. 6 Nebraska).
Still, USC coach Lane Kiffin and the Trojans are not comforted.
“I think his passing and his scrambling are what really concern me,” Kiffin said. “The called runs they’re going to run with him are tough to defend, but it’s when a play breaks down and now you’re not in your normal fits and everybody is back in man or zone 20 yards downfield and he takes off and runs.”
Besides the vengeance angle, USC enters Saturday a much different team than the one it was a year ago. For one, sophomore Matt Barkley will be the starting quarterback. Barkley was suffering from a shoulder injury this time last season, so former Trojan Aaron Corp made his only start of the year with underwhelming results.
“It was tearing me up at the hotel when they put Aaron in that little walk-through as the starter,” Barkley said. “I was trying my best to get out there, and it just didn’t happen.”
Barkley won’t have to worry about that this time around, which will be key if USC’s offense is to avoid the same miscues. Barkley leads the nation in touchdown passes with 12, and despite four interceptions, has been a major reason the offense has been explosive at times.
Senior receiver Ronald Johnson is another key player available this time who sat out because of injury. The last time these two teams met, Johnson was still recovering from a broken clavicle.
The new USC coaching staff will likely change the flavor of this game as well.
Washington coach (and former USC offensive coordinator) Steve Sarkisian knew USC inside and out last year. It doesn’t hurt that he also brought along former USC defensive coordinator Nick Holt  either.
Last year, Holt’s defense held the Trojans to just 13 points and forced three turnovers in the process. In addition, Washington only allowed three USC points in the latter three quarters of the game.
Sarkisian might still have the edge, however, because USC hasn’t changed all that much under Kiffin.
“I think it’s an advantage to them because they were here,” Kiffin said.
But Kiffin is equally familiar with Sarkisian. The two came up together as assistant coaches under Pete Carroll and even co-coordinated the offense together in 2005.
The two have kept their friendship intact over the years and said they still talk about once a week. Now they are set to coach against each other for the first time.
“It’s a unique experience, this early in our careers, to be facing each other in such a pivotal ball game in the Pac-10 race,” Sarkisian said.

If there ever is a creature that is equally feared, respected and mistrusted at the same time, it’s a journalist. It’s common to imagine a journalist with his nose inquisitively sniffing about, always prying and probing for a sensational scoop.
But Assignment: China, a film that documents the work of foreign journalists in post-Mao China, goes beyond this perception to reveal the real problems that journalists face under this stigma.
Assignment: China is a new documentary project by the USC U.S.-China Institute, an organization dedicated to the research and advocacy of a symbiotic relationship between the United States and China.
The film is a collaborative work between USCI staff and students to research, transcribe, shoot and edit all the clips and interviews. Award-winning USCI senior fellow, former CNN Senior Asia Correspondent and eight-year CNN Beijing Bureau Chief Mike Chinoy handled the writing and reporting.
The institute screened a 35-minute segment of the 110-minute film Monday, followed by a round-table discussion with Chinoy. Perhaps it was because the multimedia project is still under progress, but the film quality was fuzzy and at times transitions between interviews were rough and clipped.
But because of his experience and knowledge in the field of broadcast news in Asia, Chinoy’s narration in the film is smooth, seamless and eloquent, without intersecting the interviewees’ voices. In any case, the message that Assignment: China brought forth was clear and engaging.
The segment shown focuses on the period between 1979 and 1983, the initial years after China had begun opening up a diplomacy relationship with the United States in 1979.
It was also a time of much excitement and curiosity for the Americans. Finally, they would get the inside scoop on the happenings in China, where most foreigners were banned after the Cultural Revolution. The whole country had closed up under Chairman Mao’s regime, hiding behind a curtain of mystery on which the curious world could only speculate and often times fabricate.
Thus news coverage on Deng Xiaoping’s — China’s lead figure at the time — visit to Washington, D.C. was sensational. Footage in the film shows him smiling and waving amiably, and to the delight of Americans at the time, donning a cowboy hat.
Chinese attitudes toward foreign medi,a however, was not so friendly, as the film shows. After Deng’s 1979 visit, China allowed a selection of journalists to visit the nation on a specialized excursion, but under strict supervision and rigid regulations.
Journalists — cynical by nature — knew it was not going to be easy to report on China. After all, Chinese doors had only just tentatively begun to slide open. But still, each of them left their homeland with a vision to finally reveal an accurate picture of China and its people, only to be frustrated by the opposition and animosity they faced as a foreigner and a journalist.
Although journalists were allowed to set up full-time bureaus in Beijing, they were hardly allowed to travel out of the city. It took weeks of preparation — begging, groveling and phone calling — for a journalist to receive permits to travel out of Beijing.
Even within Beijing walls, foreign journalists had a tough time finding citizens who would actually talk to them. There was an unwritten law forbidding ordinary Chinese citizens to communicate with foreign reporters, and even if the journalist got specific permission from the government, the people were still afraid to risk repercussions.
An interview with Richard Bernstein, the first Time Beijing correspondent, recounts how a Chinese man named Liu Ching got arrested and sentenced to three years of “re-education” in prison for acquainting with a foreign reporter. The man later sneaked a detailed account of life in prison to Bernstein and subsequently received eight more years of prison.
Despite all these complications, the impact of that these journalists made can be felt simply by the fact that the world knows about most of the major events in China during that period.
All of these stories were somehow churned and squeezed out by journalists, who sometimes had to take a 20-hour train ride just to snag interviews with the locals. Yet the bits and bites of information they conveyed to the American public were paramount in affecting the diplomatic policies between the United States and China.
In the discussion after the screening, Chinoy said that although some of the information reported might have been understated or overhyped, he believed that the work of these journalists all fit together into a mosaic — a big picture that grasps an accurate and fair view of China today, despite Chinese paranoia toward foreign media.
“China shoots itself in the foot by heightening its secrecy and security towards the media,” Chinoy said. “When something happens and you’re not there, there is a greater likelihood of rumors and erroneous information.”
But China is increasingly opening up to media, Chinoy said. A big change came just before the 2008 Olympics, as can be seen by comparing the news coverage of the 1976 earthquake in Tangshan and the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. The media has finally started to penetrate the thick walls of China.
Assignment: China aims to share the battle of journalists to understand a dynamic, complex China shrouded by a rigid government throughout the tumultuous development of United States-China relations — struggling to scoop out stories, overcoming cultural and political challenges, rejoicing in their successes — all the while competing against rival journalists and meeting dreaded deadlines.

Parents weekend continues today with breakfast at 8 a.m. and an address by President C.L. Max Nikias.
The address will be held in Bovard Auditorium at 11 a.m.
Individual schools and colleges will host events, such as a Downtown walking tour with the School of Policy, Planning, and Development or an “Opera 101” class hosted by the Thornton School of Music.
“We partner with all of the schools on campus and all of the schools offer a program,” said Tina Orkin, assistant director of the Office of Parent Programs. “We think that helps parents see what’s going on, not only in the school where their child is studying, but in all of the schools on campus.”
The Stevens Institute for Innovation will hold a student innovator showcase today in the Von KleinSmid Center courtyard, starting at 11 a.m. and ending at 2 p.m.
At 5 p.m., University Public Relations will hold “Don’t Bother me, I’m Tweeting and Texting: Introduction to Social Media” in room 227 of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
On Saturday, students and parents will be able to kick off the football festivities at the Office for Parent Programs’ Saturday Tailgate at 1:30 p.m. in Alumni Park. The USC football game against Washington will begin at 5 p.m. in the Los Angeles Coliseum.
Visiting parents can use the Lyon Center and McDonald’s Swim Stadium for free on Friday and Sunday. Visitors must be 16 years of age or older.
Orkin said Parents Weekend was a valuable experience for students and parents each year.
“We’re lucky I think at USC because our constituency is not just freshman parents,” Orkin said. “We have parents who come back again and again so that encourages us to keep it fresh and up-to-date every year.”

This fall, USC’s student radio station will be heard in 1,000 American Eagle stores around the country.
American dream · Alex Yen, a junior majoring in art history, DJs at KXSC. The station’s playlist will be played in American Eagle stores. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
KXSC’s music playlist will play in U.S. and Canadian stores starting in November, after the station won a nationwide competition, according to KXSC Music Director Jace Brittain.
“We are super excited about it,” said Brittain, a junior majoring in creative writing who is on the Daily Trojan staff. “It kind of just appeared one day. It’s a nice surprise to kick start off the year.”
Filter Magazine contacted KXSC staff in mid-August to see if the station — along with other universities nationwide — would be interested in creating playlists for a nationwide American Eagle Playlist Competition.
“I said absolutely,” Brittain said. “The music department and I immediately began making a little over an 80-song playlist and then submitted it.”
With this competition, Brittain said the station is not only expanding its staff but is also expanding its audience.
“We‘ve gotten a lot of new blood and new people this semester. We are always willing to grow,” Brittain said.
Promotions Director Michel’le Roddy said she was not expecting to win the competition.
“I was really surprised,” Roddy said. “I know people hear our music and that we have quality program, but wow­ — American Eagle.”
Roddy, a junior majoring in international relations and public relations, said she believes KXSC was chosen was because of  its “upbeat” music.
“I know we all have a range of music tastes … We were looking for songs that you could shop to,” Roddy said.
Although KXSC will not gain a monetary prize for winning the competition, Brittain said the station is excited about the publicity and credibility that the station will gain nationally and within the USC community.
“I think this will show the level of taste that we have and it shows the work we are willing to put into just making a playlist,” General Manager Karl Nickenig said. “Winning this competition drives the sort of passion that everyone has at the station for what they are doing.”
Nickenig said this competition brings attention to the different promotional tools being used to explore the music industry today.
Roddy, who has been a part of the station for three years now, agreed.
“I think in the past, people may have thought of us as not being a part of USC, but now, I think that American Eagle choosing us is going to open people’s minds up to the radio station,” Roddy said.

October marks Breast Cancer Awareness month, and efforts by the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hospital and students organizations  have already begun to raise awareness across campus.
In a lifetime, one out of every eight woman will have breast cancer, according to Agustin Garcia, associate professor of clinical medicine at Keck School of Medicine.
Norris has partnered with the campus bookstore to sell pink T-shirts to promote finding the cure for breast cancer. The shirts, available in light or hot pink, depict a pink ribbon with the words “For a breast cancer cure” and “Fight on.” The Kappa Alpha Theta and Pi Beta Phi sororities are also involved in these efforts. Proceeds from the T-shirts will go to Norris.
Neha Jain | Daily Trojan
“We’re hoping to see a sea of pink T-shirts,” said Leslie Ridgeway, director of media relations at the USC Health Sciences Campus.
Norris has also partnered with the athletic department, and on Saturday will host a booth at the Coliseum before the football game, where visitors can talk to doctors and staff about breast cancer and become more educated about what can be done to prevent and detect it.
“We hope this helps everybody become more aware of breast cancer and the needs of prevention,” Ridgeway said. “Maybe women can use the month to schedule their mammograms.”
Aside from raising awareness, organizers are also hoping to raise money to fund research at Norris.
“We want to work with the USC family and we thought it would be better to keep it within the USC family,” said Garcia, acknowledging that there are many organizations the money could go to.
Sigma Lambda Gamma sorority is also working toward promoting breast cancer awareness.
For the past seven years, the sorority has hosted its signature fall event, “Check Yourself,” said Heidi Arredondo, a senior majoring in psychology and a member of the sorority.
“As women pursuing higher education, Sigma Lambda Gamma hopes to empower all women to be active in knowledge about their health,” Arredondo said in an e-mail.
“Check Yourself” is centered around a presentation given by a doctor from Keck. The audience will also hear a testimony from a breast cancer survivor.
In past years, the sorority has donated its funds to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Last year, the sorority donated more than $600 to the Denise Roberts Breast Cancer Foundation, an organization based in Inglewood that provides low-cost treatment and care to minority patients.
This year the event is on Oct. 19, and proceeds will go to the Breast Cancer Network of Strength.
“At the end of the day, what improves the cure rate of breast cancer is early detection, which is intimately related to breast cancer awareness,” Garcia said. “Early detection is really the vital element.”

Department of Public Safety released its annual security report Wednesday, which tracks on- and off-campus crime statistics. This year’s report showed an overall decrease in crime during the past three years, according to DPS officials.
Universities receiving federal aid are required by the Jeanne Clery Act to compile a campus security act by Oct. 1 of each school year. According to the act, the report must include crime data for the past three years.
“The Department of Public Safety is constantly evaluating our methods to create as safe of an environment as possible for students and faculty,” said DPS Capt. David Carlisle.
The majority of on-campus crime decreased between 2007 and 2009. Robbery, in particular, decreased significantly, down from 20 reported incidents on campus in 2007 to one incident on campus reported in 2009. Residential communities also showed a decrease in crime, said Carol Hayes, DPS director of administrative operations
“There has been a 70 percent reduction in robberies over the past four years, and we’re proud of that,” Hayes said.
The only clear increase of on-campus violent crimes was in forcible sex offenses, with nine reports in 2009, an increase from six incidents in 2008 and none in 2007.
Off-campus, public property and LAPD-reported crimes showed an increase in some crimes, such as forcible sex offenses, but a decrease in others, such as burglary.
Assistant DPS Chief John Thomas noted that although robbery incidents reported to LAPD rose in 2009, all 10 instances were associated with major events, such as raves or the parade celebrating the Los Angeles Lakers’ championship.
Both negligent and non-negligent manslaughter had zero cases in the last three years, both on campus and in the surrounding areas.
“[The report should] dispel the perception that the area around USC is more dangerous than anywhere else in L.A.,” Thomas said.
The number of liquor, weapon and drug arrests and referrals has risen since 2007, with the number of on-campus liquor law referrals reaching 107 in 2009.
“More incidents are being reported [by students], and at the same time there is an increase in the amount of alcohol-related incidents that we’re seeing on 28th Street and other places,” Thomas said.
The report included statistics for the University Park and Health Sciences campuses, as well as the Orange County, Catalina Island, Sacramento, Marina Del Rey, Alhambra Health Sciences, San Diego and Aviation centers. The satellite campuses showed relatively low levels of crime compared to the University Park Campus.
Fire safety information was also included for the first time in the report, including the status of alarm systems and instances of fires. According to the report, only one fire occurred in 2009, which was an accidental fire in the off-campus Troy apartment complex.
Even with the descending rates, Thomas said that DPS is concerned with cracking down on violent crimes in particular.
“I think it can always be improved, but we have seen the level of crimes go down in all categories,” Thomas said. “As long as it continues to go down, we’re happy, but it can always be better.”
Carlisle, Thomas and Hayes said students must be mindful of their surroundings and put safety first.
“Crime prevention measures don’t change from year to year. I talk about the importance of making smart decisions — the single most [important] component of safety is personal behavior and choices,” Carlisle said.
Carlisle also reiterated the importance of not walking alone off campus at night, taking advantage of free transportation services and not advertising valuables as students walk in the area.
Despite the lower crime rates last year, most students still seem to be mindful of the dangers on campus.
“I try not to go out after its dark, and I guess I’d call Campus Cruiser if it got too late. I also carry around pepper spray,” said Vivian Tsui, a freshman majoring in aerospace engineering.
DPS officials said they are constantly evaluating their practices in order to create the safest environment possible for students and faculty.
“Students need to be aware because it impacts the campus community that they live in,” Thomas said. “[They need to] be aware of how they can contribute to a safer environment.”

This weekend, seven members of the Women of Troy tennis team will take part in one of the most rigorous tennis tournaments they’ll compete in all season. The pre-qualifying rounds of the ITA/Riviera Women’s All-American Championships begin Saturday at UCLA, and the entire women’s tennis team will be representing USC.
To make it past the pre-qualifying rounds of the tournament, players must win three matches in a row. To advance beyond the qualifying rounds, players must win another three matches in a row, taking them to the top 16, where a single loss means elimination from the tournament.
In the past, USC has performed well at the Riviera tournament. Last year, sophomore Danielle Lao won seven matches in a row and made it to one of the top tiers of the tournament. This year, chances look good for her and many of her teammates as well.
“The All-American is a very tough tournament, and just because you do well one year it doesn’t mean you’ll do that great the next. My teammates are really motivated so I think they’ll do well,” Lao said.
Coach Richard Gallien is also looking forward to the tournament, and expressed his happiness about the team’s preparedness.
“Our girls are really ready to compete and this early in the season it makes me happy … Maria [Sanchez] has a chance to go far. Danielle was almost to the top eighth last year,” Gallien said.
Entry into the Riviera Championships is a difficult task, and not many schools are able to send every player from their tennis team to compete. USC, on the other hand, is completing a rare feat by sending all seven of its starting players.
“We are basically getting the whole team in and not many schools can say that,” assistant coach West Cott said.
This tournament, like most others during the beginning of the season, is more about individual performance rather than the performance of the team as a whole. The Women of Troy will begin competing against other schools in the Pac-10 in March, so tournaments leading up to the start of the conference season are useful for improving players’ individual rankings, though not for improving the team’s ranking as whole.
“Every school is going to be there, but really you’re just competing for yourself and for your school,” Cott said.
Lao is certain that the team’s first tournament together will be a good one.
“Right now I’m really confident in how well we’ll do, and I’m looking forward to seeing some good results and maybe even some upsets from my teammates,” Lao said.
After the pre-qualifying rounds at UCLA, play will take place in Pacific Palisades, CA. The tournament is set to continue until October 10th.

The USC men’s tennis team will be busy this upcoming weekend as players will participate in two tournaments.
The headlining event is the 2010 ITA/D’Novo Men’s All-American Championships, with three Trojans taking part in competition on Oct. 2 in Tulsa, Okla.
Nationally ranked juniors Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen, No. 7 and No. 42 respectively, will be participating in the main draw of the singles tournament.  The pair is also ranked No. 9 in doubles, and will compete in the main doubles draw.
Johnson advanced to the semifinals of the singles portion of the tournament last season.
No. 90 senior Peter Lucassen will join the duo in the tournament, and will participate in the qualifying rounds.
Past winners of this event include notable professionals including James Blake, John Isner, and Mike and Bob Bryan — winners of the 2010 US Open Doubles Championship.
Three other Trojans will head up to Northern California to participate in the Battle in the Bay Classic, hosted by the University of San Francisco.
No. 102 sophomore JT Sundling and freshmen Raymond Sarmiento and Michael Grant will participate, with Sundling and Sarmiento teaming up in the doubles draw.
“I’m really excited to be on court with them,” said coach Peter Smith — who will be joining the players in the Bay area.  “[Sundling] has been making strides on the practice court. I’m anxious to see how that translates to tournament play.”
This event will feature players from six schools in California along with four professional exhibition players.
The winner of the event will earn a wild card bid to the Tiburon Challenger — a tournament on the ATP Challenger Tour.
Also earning a national ranking but not competing this weekend is senior Jaak Poldma, ranked No. 65 prior to competitive play.  Additionally, Sarmiento is ranked as the No. 9 freshman/newcomer in the country.
The two freshmen look to gain valuable experience in the pressure cooker that is the USC men’s tennis program.   They are seen as potential contributors to the regular lineup once the team season commences.
When asked about the main adjustment for freshmen as they transition into the collegiate game, Smith responded, “Playing for USC.  If they are afraid of expectations, then this is not the right place for them.”
The competition, meanwhile, will look to prove itself against the Trojans this weekend.  Match play in the beginning of the season is imperative to discovering how the players will handle their opponents’ best efforts on court.
“All of the kids [including newcomers] are national champions,” Smith said.  “Everyone will be up for us.”
The overarching goal of the USC men’s tennis program year after year is to peak right before entering the NCAA tournament.  In the end, the more matches everyone plays the better prepared the team will be for the championships.
“It’s more important to play in these smaller tournaments to get that match experience,” Smith said.

The excuse to eat and drink oneself silly is evident in every culture. Americans have Thanksgiving, the Irish have St. Patrick’s Day, the Chinese have Chinese New Year and Moon Festival. And the Germans have Oktoberfest.
But Trojans do not need to travel overseas for a license to feast, because The Lab, USC Hospitality’s very own gastropub on Figueroa Street, is bringing the German celebration right across campus with its Oktoberfest menu, including a selection of traditional German beers.
Sophia Lee | Daily Trojan
The best time to visit The Lab is after 4 p.m. because that’s when it starts serving its homemade goulash with sautéed, hand-rolled egg noodles. It is worth visiting just for this dish alone. But arrive early — the goulash was such a hit that it was sold out on Thursday night.
The egg noodles, which are made from scratch, are chewy, thick and hardy enough to hold up to the rich beef and potato stew that comes steaming on top. The beef in the goulash is actually the same slow-braised short ribs found in The Lab’s popular IPA Short Rib Sliders, just cooked down further with chunks of potatoes in a savory tomato-based broth until the meat becomes fall-off-the-bone tender and practically melts in the mouth.
Yet another worthy dinner plate is the pork schnitzel, deep-fried boneless pork served with German potato salad and sautéed Brussels sprouts with bacon. The best part about this dish isn’t the schnitzel — which turned out a bit dry because of the thinness of the meat — but the side dishes.
Even if you detest Brussels sprouts, these pork fat-infused sprouts sautéed with vegetable stock, carrots, onions and corn will convert you. There is no weird cabbage smell — just a wonderful symphony of flavors and textures.
Chef Craig Orrell made a wise decision by serving the potato salad cold instead of in the traditionally warm German style. This makes a pleasing contrast to the hot crispy schnitzel. The typical German potato salad is also usually dressed in mustard vinaigrette, but the chef opted for a blend of American tastes by mixing in creamy mayonnaise with crunchy celery and zesty chives and parsley.
If lunch is the only time when you can make it to The Lab, never fear. Order the bratwurst, which comes artfully sandwiched in a pretzel bun and smothered in braised red cabbage slaw and thinly sliced Granny Smith apples, with Bavarian mustard for dipping.
Although the grilled pork sausage can taste bland alone, the sweet and sour combination of cabbage and apple on top makes a perfect complement. Beef lovers can order the knockwurst, which is basically the same dish except it uses beef sausage instead of pork.
For the side, opt for the sweet potato fries. Sweet potatoes are notoriously hard to cook correctly because of their higher water content, but The Lab aces the perfect fry test with its non-greasy, delightfully crispy orange spears.
But what is Oktoberfest without the beer? Approximately 66 hectoliters of beer were consumed at the 2009 Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany. Sample The Lab’s special beer menu and get a swig of the beer the Oktoberfest participants are guzzling down.
Most Germans typically like their beer traditional and basic. In fact, Germans are such purists that they even have a law mandating that the beer produced in Germany be limited to only four ingredients: malt, hops, yeast and water. You won’t find pumpkin ale, but you also won’t find watered down, urine-like beer either.
The Lab offers three special-edition beers on tap: Spaten Pils, Hofbrau Oktoberfestbier and Paulaner Hefe-Weizen. For the bottles, it serves Erdinger Dunkel-weizen, Hacker-Pschorr Octoberfest, Sparten Optimator Doffelbock and the Hofbrau Munchen Original Lager. These are generally darker beers.
Even if you can’t legally drink, don’t pass up the chance to try out The Lab’s seasonal menu. Chug down some Diet Coke, fork up some goulash and get buzzed on The Lab’s warm, inviting environment and laid-back service.
The communal tables encourage close sittings and perhaps even loose conversations with the stranger beside you. The interior design is set to give off a science laboratory ambiance with its chalkboards and slate-topped tables, but guaranteed to keep every student happy and enthusiastic for a fun gastronomical class.
Don’t be late for this class though — the Oktoberfest menu ends Nov. 4.
Correction: 10/4/2010: The Lab’s Oktoberfest menu runs until November 4th; a previous version of this story misidentified the date the menu would end.  This version of the story has been corrected to reflect the change. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
oktoberfest menu ends oct 4? or nov 4?
[…] And for a deeper question…Why do you do the stuff you do now?  P.S. To read my review on The Lab, click here. I also included a breakdown of the beer menu, which they did not publish […]

The Social Network
Rated PG-13
The film event of the year has finally arrived in theaters. Jesse Eisenberg gives a brilliant performance as Mark Zuckerberg, the computer programming guru who created Facebook as an undergrad at Harvard University. Fight Club director David Fincher lends his masterful direction to a film that works as both a social commentary and a quirky character study.
Let Me In
Rated R
It did not take long for Hollywood to make its own version of the terrifying 2008 Swedish movie Let the Right One In, about a lone vampire living in secrecy in suburbia. Chloë Moretz, best known for her role as Hit-Girl in Kick Ass, stars as the blood-sucking main character who befriends a young boy who has just moved in next door. USC alumnus Matt Reeves directs in his follow-up to the energetic monster flick, Cloverfield.

In David Lindsey Abaire’s award-winning play Rabbit Hole, Becca and Howie, a grieving mother and father, face tragic consequences eight months after their young son’s death. The two are stuck in a woeful cycle — a constant battle to cope, understand and love.
But with visits from Becca’s impetuous sister, Izzy, her rambling mother, Nat and a schoolboy named Jason, the pair is stuck trying to define its future in a world of uncertainty.
The play premiered in 2005 and won a Pulitzer Prize in 2007. It was also recently adapted into a movie to be released by the end of this year, starring Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Robert Bailey, USC’s production of Rabbit Hole shines as a deeply moving and heartfelt tale.
“[Viewers] will find themselves emotionally involved with people they’ve never met,” Bailey said.
But the play is not simply a contemporary drama; comedy strikes in almost every scene, breaking the tension of a previously serious moment.
“[Viewers] will laugh,” Bailey said.
Jordan C. Walsh and Nicholas Tagliarini are excellent as the heartbroken Becca and Howie. Their chemistry as husband and wife is believable in all aspects of their performance — from petty arguments to shared sorrow.
Walsh and Tagliarini act strongest as a pair. Nearly every scene in which they are alone draws the audience further into the minds and workings of Becca and Howie. Becca is not simply a clean freak; Howie is not as confident as he pretends to be. Their fights are so passionate and realistic that they are almost uncomfortable to watch.
The rest of the cast radiates as much talent as  Walsh and Tagliarini.
Connor Kelly-Eiding plays Becca’s childish and irresponsible sister, Izzy. Her performance is consistently strong. Her facial expressions, from sly smiles to furrowed eyebrows, are the most impressive of any of the actors.
As Nat, Madeline Hanson succeeds in being both funny and gentle. Her unique gestures — from pounding on a table to the way she holds a glass of alcohol — add a considerable amount of credibility to her character. On top of that, Hanson’s ability to adequately mimic an old woman’s voice is worth noting.
Ironically, the best performance comes from one of the smallest characters. Robert Atchinson plays teenager Jason superbly. Atchinson’s delivery of a monologue — his first scene in the play — is highly impressive. His quivery and fluid voice animates the character and allows the audience to sympathize with Jason’s youthful innocence.
But what makes this story relatable — especially to students?
“So many people, so many women, so many men, deal with [grief] every day,” Walsh said. “I hope that it’s a story that sticks with people.”
And how could it not? Rabbit Hole is not simply a story of a grieving family; it is the unfolding of a snapshot in life. The show epitomizes the repercussions of a brief yet poignant experience and how different people choose to confront these scars.
It asks the age-old question: How are people expected to cope with the death of a loved one? Every person can relate to themes like these, which is what ultimately makes Rabbit Hole such a powerful display. Each character is not simply a character but a human being undergoing dramatic change.
“Characters are similar in ways because they’re all humans,” Tagliarini said.
Rabbit Hole might evoke tears, laughter and even shock, but the experience of getting to know these characters is an entertaining journey.
“I think the cast has a real eagerness to share the story,” Walsh said.
Rabbit Hole will continue its run at the Scene Dock Theater until Oct. 3.

Despite new hits such as Twilight and True Blood, vampires are as old as the grave. But from ancient superstitions to Gothic horror, none are better known than Count Dracula, the horror icon of more than a century. Dracula has worn a dozen faces, from the tortured romantic to the lust-ridden ghoul. This weekend, the USC School of Theatre gives its own take.
“It’s not your mama’s Dracula,” said Caitlin Wachs, a senior majoring in theatre who plays Lucy Westenra. “It’s very close to the book — much closer than other adaptations.”
In many ways, this version predates many modern takes on the character. Based on the 1987 script by Mac Wellman, the play bypasses the tortured romance of the Francis Coppola film and the flourishes of Bela Lugosi, and presents a Dracula that is alluring, dangerous and detached from all humanity.
The play starts in Whitby Bay with Mina Murray (senior Jennica Hill) who recounts a strange night with her friend Lucy. Before the audience even knows what’s going on, the scene shifts to catch up with Jonathan Harker (senior Jonathan Muñoz-Proulx), who has gone mad in the Transylvanian wilderness after his encounter with a strange count.
Those familiar with the Bram Stoker novel will recognize the time-jumping narrative, which gives the play a fitting sense of unbalance. Throughout the play, the only constant is a trio of sultry vampire brides.
“It’s been fun to research Stoker and find out who Dracula actually is, as opposed to what I’ve been culturally introduced to as Dracula,” said Miya Folick, a senior majoring in theatre who plays the Count.
That’s right — Dracula is played by a woman. According to director Paul Backer, many renditions of Wellman’s play have made the same choice. Meanwhile, the Victorian novel Carmilla, which predates Dracula, was all about a lesbian vampire.
“Women as much as men possess a certain magnetism that can have a powerful effect over other people,” Folick said. “That’s what Dracula is — this strange allure and magnetism, along with this evil side. Those characteristics aren’t strictly male.”
In this play, Dracula is less a sultry zombie and more of a charismatic alien. Folick captures this with a stage presence that exists even farther outside of the play’s time line. Armed with a thick Transylvanian accent, she takes what could be a silly affectation and makes it a performance that disregards time.
Folick is far from the only highlight in the cast. Though billed as Jonathan Harker, Muñoz-Proulx plays a fusion of Harker and the crazed, insect-loving Renfield from the novel. Encapsulated in a monologue of epic proportions with a 10-person multiple-personality disorder, Muñoz-Proulx takes a crazy role and makes it both funny and pitiable.
As Lucy, Walchs has a role that has been both a floozy and a ditz. She is neither. Instead, Lucy is a fish out of water, caught in a repressed society and completely enthralled with the mysterious count who has just rolled in.
Hill becomes increasingly sinister as Mina, Joey Millin puts a batty, cowboyish spin on Van Helsing and Chase Anderson-Shaw is funny as the sexually frustrated Dr. John Seward.
The play takes great fun poking at Victorian conventions, many that were also poked at by the novel, including sex. From frat boy-approved physical stage comedy to a song about bonking far outside the context of runner’s fatigue, the play’s ribald antics add a hefty dose of fun and comedy.
The humor is a great mix of high and low comedy, with written nuances that channel the Coen brothers and random gags that take after The Rocky Horror Picture Show. There needs to be something to balance out the blood and craziness, after all. At the same time, the play’s wild turns show why people like vampires in the first place.
“Vampires are scary, but they also have things that we want — they live forever, they’re extremely powerful, they’re ambisexual and they can have anything they want,” Backer said.
This mix of horror and attraction keeps the play interesting. So do the costumes, which will have any steampunk fan slavering over the fitted coats and flashy skirts.
Sometimes the play gets a little out there — we might buy the vampire brides doing the bunny hop á la Rocky Horror, but Dracula joining in is almost too strange. With a narrative that pays little attention to linear progression, the play often leaves the audience to sit and merely absorb.
Although the ending comes like a gatecrash, it’s a bouncy ride back to beginning of the modern vampire mythos, and a refreshing shake-up of old themes.
“If people say, ‘That’s disturbing,’ I will be honored,” Muñoz-Proulx said.
True Blood fans and Buffy the Vampire Slayer veterans might not be disturbed, but they will be deliciously weirded out. With Halloween rustling closer, Dracula is a perfect welcome for the fall season. Playing from now until Oct. 3, the performance is also a great way to show off USC’s talent in ways that don’t involve football.

In accordance with Banned Books Week, which ends Saturday, USC held several different events that celebrate intellectual freedom by calling attention to censorship and repression.
On Tuesday, USC screened Howl — the story of Allen Ginsberg and the landmark 1957 obscenity case that sought to ban Howl and Other Poems on the basis that it contained no literary merit. It is no coincidence then that at Wednesday’s Visions and Voices event, USC Libraries hosted a panel to discuss Lion Feuchtwanger’s works in the context of media and government censorship.
Feuchtwanger was a German-Jewish writer of historical novels and plays. After realizing the extent of Hitler’s evil, he also published articles condemning the regime — the New York Herald Tribune published Feuchtwanger’s essay “Hitler’s War on Culture” in 1933. That same year, after learning that his citizenship and all his possessions had been taken away by the Nazis, Feuchtwanger decided to seek refuge in Southern France.
Feuchtwanger, however, was not safe from Hitler’s ever-increasing power. He was No. 1 on the Nazi regime’s list of the most dangerous authors, hence the title of the event — “Enemy Number One.”
When the Germans invaded France in 1940, Feuchtwanger was imprisoned and placed in an internment camp in France along with Nazi enemies and spies. After escaping the clutches of the Nazis, Feuchtwanger and his wife took their final refuge in Los Angeles, in a Spanish Colonial Revival house, which they called Villa Aurora.
“Enemy Number One,” featured a panel comprised of Zimbabwean writer Christopher Mlalaz and USC English professor Michelle Gordon and Wolf Gruner, a USC professor of history who holds the Shapell-Guerin Chair in Jewish Studies. Speaking of his experiences with media censorship under the government of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, Mlalazi’s experience was skillfully included within the context of Feuchtwanger’s 1940 internment and escape from Nazi-occupied France.
Mlalazi, the recipient of the 2010 Villa Aurora Feuchtwanger Fellowship, gave the audience frightening accounts of Mugabe’s censorship tactics — including a description of the torture that the production manager of his satirical play, The Crocodile of Zambezi, endured after the show’s second night.
Mlalazi himself has received ominous phone calls since announcing his excitement for winning the Feuchtwanger Fellowship on Facebook. Just like Feuchwanger, Mlalazi lives in a constant state of fear.
Fear, however, is a double-edged sword: Although it paralyzes, it also motivates. Despite some apprehension, Mlalazi will return to Zimbabwe in December so that he can be with his friends and family — and to continue helping his people answer questions about themselves and their country.
Mlalazi is careful, however, to mask his social and political critique behind a veil of abstraction and metaphor.
“We will never be silenced,” he said.
Feuchtwanger had this same mentality in the face of the enemy. He was not afraid to write an angry letter to the Nazis who took his house and burned his library. Feuchtwanger, like so many other writers, was impelled to open the eyes of the world and let them see the horrors that were occurring.
It is no wonder that Mlalazi saw a lot of himself when reading the gripping story of Feuchtwanger’s internment and subsequent escape to the United States. It is his courageous way of coping with evil that unites Mlalazi with Feuchtwanger, and a host of others. Feuchtwanger’s novels remain influential and relevant today in many ways.
At the end of the event, attendees was invited to visit USC’s Feuchtwanger Memorial Library, located on the second floor of Doheny Library. Doheny houses all of Feuchtwanger’s most valuable possessions. The Feuchtwangers’ longtime relationship with USC professor Harold von Hofe gave Marta Feuchtwanger (Lion’s wife) the reason she needed to enable USC to establish the Feuchtwanger Institute for the Study of Exile Literature.
After Marta’s death in 1987, USC retained the rights of the Feuchtwanger’s Villa Aurora and sold it to The Berlin Lottery Foundation for $1.9 million. USC also gave them a permanent loan of 20,000 books under the condition that the Villa remain as it was during Feuchtwanger’s time.
The money gained as a result, along with the royalties USC receives for Feuchtwanger’s works, helps to maintain and uphold the pristine status of the Feuchtwanger Memorial Library. In conjunction with the Visions and Voices event, USC Libraries used its rights to the author’s works to proudly showcase its recently published edition of Lion Feuchtwanger’s The Devil in France.
Considering Feuchtwanger’s passion for education and understanding and interpreting history, it would have made him proud to see such a well-attended event held in his honor. It was Marta Feuchtwanger’s dream to memorialize her husband’s life and to ensure that their book collection — which is continually being expanded — would be taken advantage of.
The Feuchtwanger’s lost all of their possessions twice to the Nazis, and they were not about to see their last collection lost in a similar way. They could not have imagined a better future for their third personal library.
I saw Crystal City’s comment. I felt a little elaboration on what he said was in order. It is well known that 110,000 Japanese Americans were locked in various internment camps around the country during WW2. It is not as well known that 11,000 German Americans and 3,000 Italian Americans shared their fate. Some Jewish refugees also found themselves interned because they wer from Germany! When I have spoken of this to people, the question is usually asked about Nazi membership. With a handful of exceptions, the answer was, by and large, no, the people interned had little to do with the Nazi Party. These 14,000 people were immigrants and their American born children who were caught in the type of vise that America would see in the McCarthy era with the  Communist Witch Hunts. For example, a business rival would call the FBI and falsely report that a family had a picture of Hitler over their mantle, when the family had no mantle at all. That family was locked up, True story. Large numbers of Italian emigres and Italian Americans were ENCOURAGED to move off the West Coast with veiled hints that what happend to the Japanese could happen to them. Fort Missoula was a biracial internment camp (Japanese/Italian). There was a family camp in Crystal City Texas that was very multiethnic and multinational. The point that I think needs to be made is that, for whatever reason or reasons, the the depth of the story of the Enemy Alien Internment Program  is far deeper than just anti-Japanese sentiment. 
The point that ties this response to the above article is that there is a small number of dedicated historians, survivors and political activist who are trying to bring the depths of the full scope of the internment to light in an era of apparent apathy.
And we, German Americans will also not be silenced.  We too were interned right here in the United States.  The media, Congress, and the Courts ignore our plea to put daylight on the events that affected the German American victims.  Nevertheless, we too will prevail!

For those with an affinity for white-boy cornrows and self-important ex-baseball players, the long-awaited second season of HBO’s Eastbound & Down has finally arrived.
Sunday night marked the premiere of the first episode of season two and with a foreign locale and a batch of new characters, it’s already shaping up to be another bout of Kenny Powers-filled hilarity.
When last season left off, main character Kenny (played by Danny McBride) — a foul-mouthed, mulleted former famous MLB pitcher — had worn out his welcome in his hometown in North Carolina, where he moved after losing his pitching contract. After getting a job at his old elementary school and reconnecting with his ex-girlfriend April (Katy Mixon), Powers spends the majority of the episodes fighting his own overexaggerated arrogance and struggling with the terms that his professional sports career might very well be over. He alienates those around him and, in the final scene of the first season, ditches April at a gas station and drives into the proverbial sunset.
Enter Mexico, the second season’s new foreign locale. Hiding from the embarrassment back home, the first episode finds Kenny south of the border with a new life of cock fighting and Mexican baseball.
The show’s second season marks a new era for HBO, a channel whose recent comedy exports have had trouble sticking it out for another year. It also denotes an HBO hit for Will Ferrell, whose production company makes Eastbound & Down. Amid all of the primetime comedy premieres in the last few weeks — The Office, It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, 30 Rock — it’s a feat that Eastbound even made a buzz, but with an angry, obnoxious character like Kenny at the helm and a whole new country full of people for him to offend, the new season is set to be as raucous as the last.

Forty-one percent of Americans do not know the name of the vice president of the United States, according to a recent poll released by The Pew Research Center.
The purpose of Pew’s U.S. Religious Knowledge Survey was to gauge how well Americans could adequately identify important aspects of major religions and their roles in public life.
In addition to the 32 questions regarding various aspects of religion, the survey asked nine focusing on nonreligious topics, such as politics, science and history. These general knowledge questions provided an alternative set of issues also pertinent to public life, with which to compare the results of the religious questions.
Asking respondents to name the vice president – Joe Biden – was one such example. Of 3,412 individuals surveyed, 59 percent correctly answered the open-ended question.
Similar questions asked respondents to state the political party currently holding a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives (Democrats) and to whom the theory of evolution by natural selection could be credited (Charles Darwin).
The average respondent correctly answered 50 percent of the religious questions, compared to 60 percent of respondents who got over half of the general knowledge questions right.
Those who identified as atheist/agnostic or Jewish showed the highest performance on general knowledge questions.
Results show that those who scored poorly on religion likewise scored poorly on the general knowledge

There is one section of the syllabi we receive each semester that instructors never forget to stress — academic integrity.
Reactions from reading those two words can range from indifference to uneasiness. Those students who flicker their eyes and bite their lips ultimately reassure themselves that after graduation, they won’t cheat anymore.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
But these words of consolation are not necessarily true.
An investigation released Monday by the Justice Department revealed that FBI agents, including supervisors, cheated on an exam on departmental policy by collaborating with others and using an answer key.
These agents were being tested on counterterrorism and surveillance procedures.
It is a scary reality that these protectors of our nation might be unqualified, leaving us sitting at home wondering how our government plans to shield us from terrorism or any number of other threats. Their decision to cheat forces us to reflect on our campus’ own issues with cheating and what it means for students’ futures.
Students don’t usually cheat to put others in harm’s way. They do so to pass, to bridge that gap between an “A” and a “B.” They convince themselves that cheating will end once their professional lives begin because then a report card doesn’t matter anymore.
Information gathered by Point Loma University gives some of the primary reasons for academic dishonesty, including pressures dealing with workload, inadequate instruction or parental guidance, laziness in attending class, and a convenient opportunity to cheat.
Still, one could argue that students cheat to their own benefit — or detriment — alone, and not intentionally at the expense of others.
During the last decade, studies by the Ethics Resource Center show that cheating and misconduct in the workplace are still common problems, though research from last year does indicate an improvement in business ethics, corresponding with the recession.
Taking the economic decline into account, the study says that “improvements tend to be temporary and that management needs to stay alert.”
Managers of professional organizations — just like our professors — are inclined to watch out for those taking advantage, lying to make it to the top.
A student cheating on an exam might not endanger any one individual or group. Blue-collar workers slacking off on the job or flirting their way to promotions might not either. An FBI agent cheating his way through a basic exam on protective measure, however, might.
And there it is: a real-life example that illustrates how cheating is dangerous. This is what students need to consider.
The issue isn’t about developing innovative ways to combat cheating; it is to make students aware of the repercussions this addiction might have on their future professional lives.
If students can hardly remain afloat in the academic pool without copying and plagiarizing, their ability to think in terms of academia is not the only problem. They lose sight of what it means to think critically and also become incapable of individually completing or learning a task in the workplace.
The Ethics Resource Center study showed that cheating in the workplace is bound to be on the rise again after the recession. One cannot help but think: that students transitioning into the professional market will be the ones studied this time.
Desperately claiming that cheating never meant to be dangerous to an individual or group should be reassessed. Cheating is dangerous — to the one who committed the act, to his academic reputation in school, to his future success as a worker, even to his country.
So don’t let cheating become an addiction and form of lifestyle, don’t let it seep into the professional atmosphere and prove the Ethnics Resource Center’s predictions false.
This time around, don’t let the words “academic integrity” cause you to flinch — instead, bear in mind that, like all things worth pursuing, it just takes a little extra effort.

We knew that it was coming. We prepared for the invasion. Thousands of empty white chairs suddenly appeared in organized rows on the lawns across campus heralding their arrival. White tents were strategically placed to provide shelter, food stations and an organized registration for the thousands of new campus occupants.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
Our parents have arrived.
Some aspects of our collegiate lives we might actually want to show our parents, expecting them to continue in their roles of our biggest fans.
We tout our recent midterm grades (if they were in fact acceptable), show off our class projects and engage our parents in clever discussions, displaying our prowess in regurgitating whatever class material is still lodged in our short-term memory.
And yet, students still have had to do some preparation for this temporary occupation.
Surely we’ve all spent some time figuring out what about our lives needs to be hidden from Mom and Dad, and many among us have prepared to mask our usual, but clearly substandard, living conditions.
We tidy our dorms and apartments, stash our piles of laundry (excluding the few lucky students who simply have Mom to wash and fold them while she’s here). In the event we didn’t do so well on the midterms, we look for ready topics and activities to distract from the potentially disastrous subject of grades.
We also pretend we haven’t been living on only two meals a day, alternating between breakfast cereal and the chicken ramen family pack — while eating out of the only bowl, or Pyrex measuring cup, that we own. And some students choose to refrain from their typical weekend activities — partying, drinking, etc. — in the interest of being cognizant of family time.
As for the professors, they can suffer a trepidation similar to students over the Parents Weekend festivities.
Some might need to clean up their act and normalize their behavior, just as we do.
Otherwise, those shrewd parents who choose to sit in on a class might end up figuring out the rate they’re being charged for corny jokes and irrelevant tangents —  not that any professors are guilty of that. As the most visible representatives of the university, professors must put on their best faces and sound their smartest to prove the value of a USC education.
But what about the impact on the school? Our university hosts a vast array of events to keep Parents Weekend bustling. On one hand, there’s some implicit stress for the administrators over event planning and coordination.
And on the other, it’s an opportunity to showcase USC as an amazing marketplace of ideas and opportunities, as well as to provide comfort to parents in their tuition check-writing time of anguish.
Unlike the rest of us, the university has nothing to hide from the oncoming tide of parents (hopefully, that is.  The athletic probation has already worn us out — we’ve hit our scandal quota for now).
To any parents reading this column, we really are learning all of those things that we’re supposed to learn here. Even though professors might be smiling more this weekend and eliminating the occasional profane word, they are nevertheless brilliant and accomplished.
We are fortunate to be learning at their hand, and we’re making great strides under their direction.
We’re also getting plenty of exercise. And, with all of the recent furor over the medical necessity of proper amounts of Vitamin D, rest assured that we’ve been getting plenty of sunshine here in SoCal — even an excess in the last few days with this 113-degree heat wave.
When we need to take a break and do something fun, we have plenty of places to choose from — the Pacific Ocean, L.A. Live, Disneyland — to get us ready to dive back in and work hard to make you proud.
All humor aside, we’re glad you’re here. We’re immensely proud of our school and hope you have a great time this weekend. And to students, when you’re through crying over your parents’ departure (whether real or feigned), never fear — life as we know it resumes Sunday night.

Awww we already miss coming to parents weekend and our kid just graduated last May.  Enjoy it all!

Students at USC are used to DPS crime reports sent out to notify them of recent crimes in the University Park area. Now, the Los Angeles Times is rolling out a new database with information and maps on all serious crimes recorded by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
Information on crimes is public under California law and must be provided by law enforcement upon request. The Times’ program was created in an attempt to make this information more easily accessible to the general public.
The program allows users to search its database by address, analyze crime statistics, search for crime patterns and sign up to receive alerts when several crimes occur in a specified area over a short period of time.
Some experts warn that with such a large amount of data being made public, there is the potential for misinterpretation.

On Monday, temperatures in Downtown Los Angeles reached a sweltering 113 degrees — the highest all-time temperature recorded for the area.
In fact, the temperature might have been recorded as being higher, had the Downtown thermometer not gone haywire past the 113-degree mark.
But of course, most USC students didn’t need a thermometer to tell them it was insufferably hot, evident in the pained expressions of students walking through the involuntary on-campus sauna.
Students found a variety of ways to deal with the oppressive heat, from taking refuge in the makeshift wading pool in front of Leavey Library to sleeping in the bottom floor of their dorms to avoid the rising heat in the dead of night.
Although some were able to retreat in their air-conditioned igloos, many were not as fortunate.
In light of the mega heat wave that’s swept the campus this week, we want to know:
How satisfied are you with the temperature-regulating amenities in your current residence?  Are heating and cooling a luxury, or a necessity?

For the second straight week, ESPN’s College GameDay will feature a matchup with a Pac-10 team.
For the second straight week, USC is not that team.
In the previous decade, this would have been unthinkable. Pete Carroll invaded the Pac-10 and the Trojans were soon lords of the empire. Only a few times during USC’s run of seven straight Pac-10 championships — most notably in 2007 when Oregon and Cal both rose to No. 2 and Arizona State hit No. 5 nationally — did the rest of the conference try to throw a coup d’état.
The matchup between No. 4 Oregon and No. 9 Stanford this Saturday, two of the three Pac-10 teams currently ranked higher than undefeated USC, officially signals the rise of depth and parity in the Pac-10.
Believe it or not, that’s a good thing for the Trojans.
Or course, this makes the most sense if USC can remain undefeated and beat the higher-ranked foes. If this happens, the Trojans will most likely be in the top 5 come November, and then there will be talk about them winning the AP title even though they can’t go to a bowl game.
Without the depth in the Pac-10, USC wouldn’t even have a chance to crack the top 5, maybe even not the top 10. Unfortunately for the Trojans, its non-conference schedule of solely FBS teams turned out to be easier than slicing a fork through tiramisu. That, combined with the negative national perception of USC thanks to the sanctions, ousting of the athletic director and Heisman Trophy fiasco, doesn’t give voters the sense of gusto USC once had.
But say the Trojans don’t win. Say the depth and strength of the Pac-10 is too much for them to handle and they end up in the middle of the conference at the end of the season. Is the depth still good for them?
While anyone’s initial reaction would be to go all Will Smith and say “Aw hell no,” Trojan fans should take a deeper look and realize the depth could still help the Trojans.
It’s no secret that USC has played with far less than the maximum number of scholarship players allowed on the roster this season. The Trojans are so stretched to the limit that coach Lane Kiffin half-joked at practice Tuesday that he had kids from science class who had never played football filling out the practice squad. Kiffin limits tackling during practice to keep the team healthy, because one or two injuries could be the difference between one loss and three losses.
With three Pac-10 teams above USC trying to hog the conference spotlight this year, the pressure is off the Trojans to do well. Almost everyone expects them to finish third or fourth in the conference at season’s end. This means that USC doesn’t have to worry about embarrassing itself (for the most part) on the national stage.
This is important because now the Trojans have a few years to buy into the philosophy of its new coach. Kiffin could not have chosen a better time to come to USC. The pressure is off him to win the BCS Championship in his first few years, meaning that the microscope isn’t so sharply focused on him and he can spend some time making his mark on the program. Fans and supporters will also have an adjustment period instead of calling for his head if he doesn’t win the national championship in his first year.
USC’s role as an underdog, something it hasn’t been in quite some time, benefits the program as well. With the sanctions on the team, the Trojans have shown that they are down, but not out. In any situation, the best thing to do after getting a blow to the face is retreat to your corner, get stitched up and think of a new plan of attack so that when it’s time to get back into battle, you will be ready.
With the newfound conference depth, the Trojans are able to do just that, lick their wounds and get healed. If they were supposed to be the best team in the league, they would have to try to recuperate with the expectation of winning the Pac-10, which is tough to do. I’m not saying the team is just giving up and doesn’t expect to win the conference, because it does, but there’s a difference between national expectations this year and a few years ago.
The Trojans are still putting their full effort into winning the AP national championship and the Pac-10 title, but the depth of the Pac-10 allows them to let someone else carry the conference burden. With that in place, the Trojans can now sneak up on the leaders and reclaim the throne that they lost.

I’ve been saying for a while now,  that no matter how stacked the odds are against us, if we can run the table and convincingly beat Oregon(and Stanford too, now), we have a shot with the AP voters. If the Ducks go on to win the BCS Title, there is no way we can’t win the AP Title. How would they deny us? Auburn was denied in the early 1990s in a similar situation, but in an era of overtime and conference title games, I don’t see how their fate could mirror ours. 
Having said that, I think SC has an absolutely daunting schedule remaining, and as of now I’d imagine that we should be listed as underdogs in at least four of those games(at Stanford, Oregon, at Arizona, at Oregon State). It’s a whole new season starting Saturday and I really don’t know what to expect.

Dennis Packer has seen it all.
He’s been rinkside at the Forum, courtside at Pauley Pavilion, behind home plate at Dodger Stadium and had 50-yard line seats at the Coliseum.

And while most fans never see him, they are all aware of his presence. With every score, penalty, hit and play, Packer is there, following the game right along with the fans.
Packer has been at every USC home football game for the last 20 years. Impressive, given he was a full-time police detective until 2008. But that’s just his day job. Saturdays in the fall, Packer exchanges his badge for a microphone.
Packer has been the announcer for USC football since 1990. It is his voice heard across the bowl before each game: “Your, USC Trojans!” and it is his voice that rises above the din after a “Touchdown, USC!”
For Packer, it all started in the 11th grade at James Monroe High School in the Valley.
“They had just gotten a new sound system in the gym,” Packer said. “And seeing as I wasn’t good enough to actually play basketball, they wanted me to announce the game.”
By the time he graduated in 1968, Packer was doing the public address for basketball, baseball and football games at Monroe. He assumed the same roles at L.A. Valley Junior College.
In 1970, Packer transferred to UC Davis, where he announced for basketball and baseball. He wanted to be a TV reporter after graduation, and made a few on-air appearances with NBC Sacramento during his senior year. However, he was not offered a job.
Packer returned to the L.A. area and enrolled in the police academy in 1973. Just two years later, he was back at L.A. Valley Junior College, announcing football. It was there that he caught his big break.
While announcing a game, he was mistaken for the “voice of L.A. sports,” John Ramsey.  Ramsey was a legend in Los Angeles, announcing games for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Angels, Kings, Rams and USC football. It was near impossible to go to a sporting event and not hear his voice. And it just so happened that the person who mistook Packer for Ramsey was none other than Ramsey’s uncle.
“He wandered up to the booth expecting to see his nephew, and instead I’m sitting there in front of the mike,” Packer said. “Needless to say he was quite surprised.”
Ramsey was looking for someone to fill in for him when he had a scheduling conflict, and his uncle passed Packer’s name along.
“A few days later I get a Dodger press credential in the mail and a phone call asking me to come to the stadium that Saturday and try out as Mr. Ramsey’s backup,” Packer said.
When Packer arrived, he was one of four people auditioning for the job. Ramsey told him to go behind home plate and do the pregame routine, just like Ramsey would.
“The crowd was quite confused  because they heard John speaking, but they could see he wasn’t at the microphone,” Packer said. “And when I finished John told the other three guys that they could just go home; I had gotten the job.”
The next week was Packer’s first day on the job.
“I’m really nervous, so I get to the ballpark early enough that they’re still serving breakfast in the press dining room,” Packers aid. “I get my food and go to sit by myself, and after a little bit someone taps me on the shoulder and asks if he can eat with me. Well I felt like the hand of God had touched me, because it was Vin Scully.”
When Packer got home after the game, he had about 200 messages on his answering machine, including one from the Chief of Police — who wanted to congratulate him and ask for tickets.
Over the years Packer filled in for Ramsey anywhere he was needed. Eventually, Packer took over the Angels public address for 18 years, the Dodgers for five years, the Clippers for 10, the Kings for 11 and the Raiders for 13 — the entire time the team was in Los Angeles. Packer even flew to Oakland every Sunday to announce for the Raiders the first two years after they left Los Angeles.
In 1994, Packer announced the World Cup at the Rose Bowl. Packer called this one of his greatest challenges, “because of all the different languages and pronunciations of names.”
This is an aspect of the job Packer find particularly difficult.  Petros Papadakis was a USC running back in the late 1990s. The name alone appears difficult enough to pronounce, but Packer remembers that Papadakis was fond of “changing its pronunciation.” One day it was Pa-pa-day-kus, the next Pa-pa-dah-kus.
“Be careful who you ask about names,” Packer said. “Baseball players are as big of pranksters as there are in sports, so I learned the hard way to ask the club P.R. people instead of the players whenever I did baseball.”
Once, however, Packer took trying to get it right a bit too far. In 1985, the Soviet Union Hockey Team was going to play its first game ever against an NHL team. The Soviets were to take on the Kings at The Forum, where Packer was the public address announcer.
“I might have gotten a little carried away, because I decided I wanted to do every announcement in both English and Russian,” Packer said.
Packer met with a Russian professor at USC, who helped him translate his announcements. He spelled everything out phonetically, and then proceeded to deliver all his opening announcements — in both languages — perfectly. Too perfectly, as it turned out.
“After I finished, and before the game started, the referee came up to me. And it turns out he’s Russian,” Packer said laughing. “And he starts talking to me in Russian, and all I’m doing is nodding my head yes or no. Well I guess I did it in the right order, because he skated away without incident.”
But that’s not the whole story. During the game, a Russian player was penalized.
“This player turns to me and starts talking to me in Russian, because at this point the entire arena is convinced I can speak Russian. Well I guess I didn’t nod my head at the right times, because he gets really mad at me and chucks the chair he was sitting on at the glass between us,” Packer said.
“I was supposed to meet the [Russian] team afterwards, but I got out of there as fast as I could.”
Although Packer has dropped much of his announcing duties, he still has fond memories of his hectic life behind the mike. In one instance, Packer was slated to announce for both the USC and UCLA football teams on the same day. The USC game went to overtime and did not end until 6:30. The UCLA game was to start at 7, with introductions at 6:45.  Packer took a helicopter from the top of the Seeley G. Mudd building to the Rose Bowl, arriving just a few minutes late.
His favorite event he has announced is the so-called “Miracle on Manchester.” It was game three of an NHL best-of-five playoff series in 1982 between the Kings and the Wayne Gretzky-led Edmonton Oilers. The Oilers were heavy favorites, but the two teams had split the first two games in Edmonton.
In game three at The Forum, however, the Oilers were asserting their dominance. The Kings trailed 5-0 with 18 minutes left, but managed to tie the score at the end of regulation. The Kings won two minutes into overtime.
“I try my best not to be a cheerleader,” Packer said. “But that game — I still get chills thinking about it.”
Not being partial is something Packer prides himself on. In the 1993 football season, he announced for both USC and UCLA. After their game at the Rose Bowl, the athletic directors from both schools told him that they “couldn’t tell who he was rooting for.” Of the many compliments Packer has been given over the years, this remains one of his favorites.
Today, Packer is an intelligence analyst with the Drug Enforcement Agency during the week, the announcer for the San Diego Chargers on Sundays, and of course, the voice of the Coliseum on Saturdays. He says few things get him more excited than when the drum major stabs the center of the field.
“Because then,” Packer said, “everybody knows, it’s game time.”
So this Saturday against Washington, take a listen to the voice echoing from the loudspeakers, and know that is Dennis Packer, the voice of USC football.
Clarification: 9/30/10- Dennis Packer is the second from left in the picture accompanying this story.  A previous version of the caption misidentified Packer in the photo. 
Everybody’s gonna think I’m the handsome guy on the left…unfortunately, I’m the guy second from the left.
Replacing John Ramsey, and later Dennis Packer,  has always been my dream job!
I’m in the book if they need me!

Freshman quarterback Jesse Scroggins did his best Jake Locker impersonation as he led the scout team in practice for the second day in a row.
Study time · Lane Kiffin, Matt Barkley and the Trojans have studied hard for Washington, who has been disappointing so far this season. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan 
At 6-foot-3, 205 pounds, Scroggins is not a bad replica for the USC defense as it prepares for the real Locker, who is the same height and 25 pounds heavier. Locker was a preseason Heisman candidate and is easily Washington’s biggest offensive weapon.
For Scroggins, it presented an opportunity to see significant action with the scout team rather than watch it from the sidelines.
“I think that’s one of the reasons they allowed me to go to scout, just to get my feet wet,” Scroggins said. “I’ve just been standing at practice.”
The young quarterback from Lakewood, Calif., said he sees the opportunity as a privilege and a vote of confidence from coaches.
“They’re basically giving you this role, they think you can play this role,” Scroggins said.
Scroggins said he approaches time in practice as a chance to improve his skills.
“It’s a job. You have to treat it as a job, it’s your career,” he said.
Scroggins, who enrolled at USC early so he could participate in spring practice, said it has been a difficult transition from high school.
“It got overwhelming real quick,” Scroggins said, referring to dealing with a more complex playbook and an entirely different atmosphere.  When he first starting calling plays in the huddle, he was so nervous he stuttered as he made the call.
The 18-year-old received guidance and encouragement from his veteran teammates, including fellow quarterbacks Matt Barkley and Mitch Mustain as well as the offensive linemen.
“The older guys looked down to me and they just said, ‘Relax. Just be you,’” Scroggins said.
Though Scroggins’ contribution has been limited so far at the early stages of his career, his impersonation of Locker on the scout team this week is essential to the Trojan defense. USC coach Lane Kiffin called Locker, who has at times been projected to be the No. 1 quarterback taken in the next NFL draft, “the most dynamic player” USC has seen so far this season.
As for Scroggins, he has picked up a few things about the potential future-NFL pick.
“I’ve learned that Jake Locker’s a competitor,” Scroggins said. “The guy is smart — real smart — and makes good plays.”

Although some expected Washington to break its way into the national polls this year, the Huskies have had a disappointing 1-2 start so far.
It is the Trojans, on the other hand, who finally made gains in the rankings for the first time this season, moving from No. 20 to No. 18.
“There must have been a lot of teams that lost in front of us,” Kiffin said.
USC began the season ranked No. 14, but dropped two spots each week despite winning its first three games. Kiffin maintained that the rankings are still meaningless in his eyes.
“We don’t concern ourselves with that. We can’t control it,” Kiffin said.
