As AI proliferates into the general populace, its usage for deep fake pornography seems to be horrifyingly on the rise. Ethical implications about academic writing, article writing and more are commonplace in the AI discussion, but there are particularly important ethical issues where images are concerned. AI has the power to create images of people out of thin air using pre-existing images and videos, colloquially referred to as deepfakes. 
Deepfakes and AI-generated images are not always picture perfect. AI often adds one or two fingers too many, and the speaking audio and video may not line up, making the visuals presented seem robotic. Nonetheless, AI audio can often be quite realistic and even used for light hearted purposes, as seen recently with the TikTok trend where users make videos of  President Joe Biden and former Presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump playing video games together. These are generally discernible by the public, but in the realm of pornography, AI is facing issues regarding a lack of consent.
Deepfakes and deepfake pornography have been an issue for a while, with their inception in 2017 when a Reddit user doctored pornographic content of celebrities, including Gal Gadot, Taylor Swift and Scarlett Johansson. In a 2019 report by cyber-security company Deeptrace, researchers found that 96% of deep fake content is pornographic content. However, AI gives it new power. 
There, seemingly, was a rise in the usage of deepfake porn apps in the beginning of the year following the exposé of a Twitch streamer named Brandon Ewing. Ewing had accidentally revealed he had made AI porn of his female friends, many being his fellow Twitch streamers. While major companies, such as Reddit, PornHub and Discord, have banned deepfake porn and apps the produce it and many smaller websites still run rampant. 
Only California and Virginia have laws explicitly protecting women who find deepfake pornography of themselves, leaving most women unable to legally advocate for the removal of the content or though, press charges. Celebrities and public figures are far from the only individuals affected. SXSW documentary “Another Body” shows that it can happen to anyone, even a random college girl. Finding deepfake pornography of oneself is increasingly becoming reality. 
Autonomy over one’s own images, or lack thereof, is far from a novel battle in the age of social media. However, in a world where sex is, unfortunately, too often used as a power tool, the ability to manipulate images into pornographic ones has a potential to destroy the lives, careers and mental wellbeing of women everywhere.  
Revenge porn has long wreaked havoc. While the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1988 restricted the use of computer-generated images of minors engaging in sexually explicit content , there weren’t any laws barring the non consensual distribution of lewd images of those who are of legal age. 
In recent years, federal legislation has been passed to criminalize revenge porn. Now, though, he ability to create AI deepfake porn probes a whole new ethical dilemma and a whole new legal fight. Just as we begin to nail the coffin on revenge porn, AI porn opens a whole new uphill battle women must fight to retain autonomy over our images, or at least, what little is now left of it.

Growing up in East Los Angeles, countless images of the Virgen de Guadalupe decorated local mercados, or corner stores. Each block is a community united by shared dreams and ambitions. This is the heart of Chicano soul music.
For East L.A. native and musician, Joey Quiñones, paying homage to a genre that combines the avidity of Latin funk with the spirit of R&B requires mastery within such art. Hearing his unique rasp alongside a range of tender drawl allows listeners to seek comfort in a stranger whose voice fills up the empty space surrounding them. 
Quiñones is now the lead singer of Thee Sinseers, a band producing work inspired by 1960s classics such as Thee Midniters. Although they draw from the success of artists who have come before them, Thee Sinseers have ultimately made a name for themselves through their signature fusion of velvet-like vocals and punctuated rhythms. 
The band performed this past Saturday at Ventura Music Hall, headlining a memorable night for everyone in attendance. It was an experience that penetrated beneath the skin, peeling back the ample layers that unlocked my devotion toward loved ones. The set felt like a warm embrace, a homecoming of sorts, as I was suddenly transported to the calm mornings spent at my grandparents’ house. It was as if the music was timeless, pulling at the strings of youth, allowing attendees to reminisce upon a time when they truly felt at ease. 
The ensemble of Adriana Flores, Christopher Manjarrez, Francisco Flores, Bryan Ponce, Luis Carpio, Eric Johnson, Joseluis Jimenez and Steve Surman showcased a wide range of instruments, from trombones to saxophones to guitars. Weaving in these mechanisms with the fantastic hums of doo-wop only elevated the caliber of each member, whose delectable tones could be recognized from every song played.
Gently swaying to melodies that mimic eternal bliss, lulling one to complete tranquility, allowed me to find solace within a crowd of romanticists and visionaries alike. Thee Sinseers focused on the simplicity of human connection, a fundamental aspect of our lives we often forget about. 
They dared the audience to reflect on what they are grateful for, a reminder to never forget where we come from and those we have met along the way. This idea of gratitude, which evoked content for every individual’s journey thus far, despite having faced obstacles within their lives, as “It Was Only a Dream” permeated through the background, best illustrates the concert’s mood. 
It is safe to say that I shed some tears, as I fought to choke back violent sobs during “Seems Like” and “It’s Only Love”. Both tunes highlight the beauty of passion in the form of a catchy melody with an ethereal state of mind. Thee Sinseers’ ballads are not just composed of lyrics for people who have been exposed to romantic relationships. Even though many couples were present during their set, so were families and friends, people who cared deeply about one another — whose unconditional love exceeded words and expectations. 
Thee Sinseers truly put on a spectacular set, tethered by the intimacy of mutual bonds formed before and during the show. If you are looking to relieve an aching heart or perhaps hoping to feel closer to your loved ones, I highly encourage listening to the band. Most importantly, I am also incredibly proud that the band continues to deliver an ode to my forever home in East L.A.

With the recent release of “Drive to Survive” fifth season, Formula 1 sees yet another year of thrilling races between 20 of the best drivers in the world. It’s impossible to talk about drivers without mentioning the seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton of the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team. Hamilton is known not only for his prowess on the track, but also for his unique and inclusive fashion sense, making him one of the most recognizable figures in the world of motorsport.
In 2018, the 62-time Grand Prix winner became the global menswear ambassador for iconic American designer and label Tommy Hilfiger. Shortly after this announcement, Hamilton and Hilfiger unveiled their collaborative collection, Tommy X Lewis, which put an emphasis on celebrating individuality and challenging traditional conventions.
Since then, the collection has constantly embodied the spirit of both creative parties, reflecting their shared values of diversity and inclusivity. The line combines Hamilton’s passion for streetwear and his distinctive style with the classic Americana aesthetic that is synonymous with the Tommy Hilfiger brand.
In their fourth and my personal favorite capsule collection, Grammy award-winning musician H.E.R. joined the partnership and delivered Tommy X Lewis X H.E.R. The brand new apparel line followed a “style for all” motto that embraced the idea of genderless fashion, catering to a more inclusive and diverse audience. 
“We are united in the belief that fashion should be for everyone, so putting inclusivity at the heart of the capsule was a no-brainer,” H.E.R. wrote in a statement.
Apart from showcasing creative synergy between the three collaborators, the bundle furthered its dedication to minimizing environmental impact by using 100% organic cotton. The collection showcased a serene, stylish and vibrant design, featuring a color scheme of gentle neutrals, black, bright green, and the signature red, white and blue hues of Hilfiger.
For Hamilton, fashion has always been a vessel of self-expression and served as a key element in his own clothing brand, +44. The number 44 holds special significance for the Brit, as it’s been his racing number since eight years old, accompanying him during his victories, championship titles and other achievements in motorsport. +44 was officially launched in early 2022, this time in synergy with world-renowned Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.
“When I launched +44, I wanted to create bold, brave and transformative collections that made people feel the most authentic versions of themselves,” said Hamilton in an interview with Highsnobiety. 
Murakami’s saturated style was a perfect match for +44’s vision of describing “the inner race,” or the mental and spiritual alignment needed to achieve F1 success. Taking inspiration from anime, manga and the conceptual framework of “psychedelic speed demon,” +44’s second drop introduced T-shirts, long sleeves, a hoodie and a circuit jacket, all of which incorporated Murakami’s signature epochal design atop various race-inspired garments.
The brand dedicates a large portion of its identity to reinforcing individuality.
“We’ve worked together to make each piece reflective of our shared passion for the unique, psychedelic and a celebration of what makes us all different,” Murakami said.
Other than off-circuit fashion achievements, Hamilton’s style choices often extend beyond his personal wardrobe and into his racing gear. He has been known to customize his racing helmets, featuring unique designs and colors that reflect his personality and pay tribute to his heroes or memorable moments in his career. For instance, Hamilton donned a helmet adorned with colors of the LGBTQIA+ Pride flag at a race in Saudi Arabia in 2021. The 38-year-old described the anti-LGBTQIA+ in the host country as “terrifying” and requested F1 to address human rights issues in countries where Grand Prixes are held. 
“In the last race you saw the [rainbow] helmet that I wore. I will wear that again here and in the next race [in Abu Dhabi] because it is an issue,” Hamilton told The Guardian. “If anyone wants to take time to read what the law is for the LGBT+ community, it is pretty terrifying. There are changes that need to be made.” 
Just ahead of last year’s Monaco Grand Prix, which is often referred to as the “crown jewel” of F1, Hamilton revealed a one-off helmet designed by contemporary artist Daniel Arsham. The white and purple hued helmet was inspired by Hamilton’s favorite crystal, the amethyst, which also has “protective and healing qualities.” After the race, the helmet was sold and proceeds went toward Hamilton’s foundation, Mission 44, which “seeks to transform the lives of young people from underserved backgrounds.”
Hamilton has proven himself to be a true ambassador of change by bringing fresh and inclusive perspectives to the worlds of fashion and F1. Through his daring fashion sense and collaborations with famous designers and artists, the Stevenage native has demonstrated that individuality, creativity and social responsibility can be seamlessly integrated into the realm of motorsport. As a role model and trendsetter for many, Hamilton continues to inspire fans and peers alike, proving that the drive to succeed transcends the boundaries of the racetrack and extends to the broader aspects of life.

The No. 18 ranked Trojans finished off their second leg of Pac-12 games this past Sunday with a 14-4 win over Oregon. USC women’s lacrosse is now on a four-game win-streak and stands at 8-2 overall and 3-0 in Pac-12 play. 
Following a win against the Colorado Buffaloes Friday, where the Trojans let up in the fourth quarter, Head Coach Lindsey Munday stressed the importance of playing hard in all four quarters. 
“Collectively, this was a huge team win, and [a key] coming in was just a full 60-minute game, which is what we did today,” Munday said. 
After an early goal from Oregon, USC took full control of the game. The Trojans scored seven unanswered goals until mid-way through the second quarter when Oregon senior Alyssa Wright scored to make it 7-2. The Trojans then ripped off three more goals and led 10-2 at halftime, outmuscling the Ducks who seemingly had no answer for the Trojans. 
One major key for the Trojans was their ability to consistently win on draw controls. Graduate student midfielder Katie Ramsay secured 11 draw controls and, overall, USC won 16 draw controls to Oregon’s five. This development encouraged Munday, following the Colorado win where she believed the Trojans were not as successful in draw controls.
“On Friday, we struggled a bit on the draw controls, so I think Katie Ramsey and the crew around her stepped up today, and I think if you really dominate the draw you can get more possessions and it hurts [Oregon] offensively because [they] got less touches,” Munday said. 
USC was efficient with those opportunities too, scoring 14 goals on 16 shots on goal compared to Oregon, who scored 4 on 10 shots on goal. The Trojans attacked the Ducks from all sides, with eight different Trojans registering a goal or an assist. 
Sophomore attacker Maddie Dora and redshirt sophomore attacker Isabelle Vitale led the way for the Trojans, as each had 5 points, with Dora scoring four goals. Senior attacker Ella Heaney added a hat trick as USC piled goal upon goal. 
“Oregon went in and out of a zone and we all needed to make sure we were spaced out and communicating throughout the whole [game], and I think everyone did a good job of just following the game plan whether they were in man or zone,” said Dora following the game.  
USC did not score in the final quarter, but they didn’t need to. They scored four more goals in the third quarter to the beat of a 12-goal lead. 
USC’s defense was just as impressive, forcing eight turnovers and limiting Oregon’s ability to get off clean shots. Junior goalkeeper Kait Devir secured five saves while allowing just two goals in 45 minutes of play. 
USC has solidified its first place position in the Pac-12 with wins against Arizona State, Colorado and, now, Oregon. The Trojans have steadily improved throughout the season, and Munday is happy with her team’s mentality.
“Our focus all year has just been getting better. I think it does not matter how you are in February, but how you are in March, April, May, if you have the opportunity,” Munday said. “This team has done a good job being happy with wins and getting excited about that because that’s important, but also looking in the mirror and getting at it the following week to continue to get better.” 
The Trojans will travel up north next weekend with games at Berkeley and Stanford Friday and Sunday, respectively. They’ll look to further the gap in the Pac-12 as they enter the second half of their season.

USC’s acceptance rate for the 2022-23 college application season was 9.9%, the University announced Monday, setting another record for the lowest acceptance rate in school’s history. This year, the University received 80,790 applications and accepted 8,032 of them for the Fall 2023 semester. An additional 1,245 applicants were accepted for Spring 2024 admission. 
Dean of Admission Timothy Brunold said the University received 17% more applications this year than for the 2022 admission cycle. Approximately 12,000 more students applied to USC this year than in 2022, and 10,000 more than the previous record set in 2021.
“We set a record in terms of first year application volume this year,” Brunold said. “This is not necessarily something we were trying to set out to do. But it was an enormous one year increase.” 
One new aspect of this year’s admissions cycle was the addition of an official early action admissions option, which mandated that students must apply to USC by Nov. 1 and select “early action” as their admissions category to be considered for merit scholarships. These applicants could either be accepted early and considered for these scholarships or deferred to the regular admissions pool. Brunold said just under half of the applicants applied under this new option. 
Brunold said the admissions office was pleasantly surprised with the number of early action applicants, but it was too early to tell if the addition affected the total number of applications received. 
“I don’t know that any of us would have predicted that [number of early action applicants],” Brunold said. “From a standpoint of putting that option out there for students, it was indeed a very popular option.” 
USC set a record with the percentage of admitted students who are first generation college students. This year, first generation students make up 23% of admitted applicants. 
Brunold said this was also the first year the University tracked the number of nonbinary applicants, making up just over 1% of those admitted. As another first, 60 admitted students applied under USC Gould’s new undergraduate major in legal studies. 
The percentage of international students has seemed to recover from previous years, Brunold said. Nineteen percent of admitted students are from an international community of 87 countries. 
“International applicants had begun taking a downward turn, both after the Trump administration came into the White House but also because of the pandemic,” Brunold said. “This is probably the first post-pandemic year that is more back to normal.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the Class of 2027 acceptance rate as 11.5%. While it is true that 11.5% of applicants were accepted for Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 combined, USC Undergraduate Admission only accounts for Fall 2023 admits in its calculations of acceptance rates. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The Trojans completed a three- game sweep of the Washington State Cougars on a clear Sunday afternoon at Dedeaux Field. USC is now 14-8-1 on the season after its first series sweep of the Cougars since 2002. It’s now in third place in the Pac-12, holding a 7-2 record in conference play.
“[The sweep] is a momentum boost, confidence boost,” said Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz in a postgame interview. “It’s not easy to sweep in the Pac-12 … A lot of times on a Sunday when you win a series you just kind of go through the motions, take the series and go home, but we were greedy today.”
Things started off at Dedeaux Field with an iconic first pitch from one of the pioneers of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Ninety-six-year-old Maybelle Blair threw a pitch right down the middle, just like she used to in her playing days that inspired the movie “A League of Their Own” (1992).
Redshirt freshman right-handed pitcher Eric Hammond got the nod and fared well against the Cougars. He started off the game with a quick 1-2-3 first inning. Then, in the bottom half of the first, the Trojans got on the board thanks to a stand-up triple from redshirt freshman second baseman Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek after the center fielder for Washington State, junior Jonah Advincula, misplayed the ball and tripped. Junior left fielder Carson Wells then brought Martin-Grudzielanek home on an RBI groundout. 
Hammond finished the start, going five innings strong, allowing two earned runs and striking out two batters. This was the longest outing of Hammond’s first six starts of the season.
“[Hammond’s] offspeed stuff was working a little, his fastball command was sometimes a little inconsistent, but he’s healthy, he’s strong,” Stankiewicz said. “I’m glad that he fought through it a little bit … I’m proud of his effort, he’s found a way to get us back in the dugout numerous times.” 
The Cougars quickly tied the ballgame in the top of the second after an RBI fielder’s choice from senior left fielder Greg Fuchs. The Trojans responded in the bottom half, scoring two runs of their own with RBIs from redshirt freshman shortstop Caiden Huber and senior catcher Connor Clift.
Washington State’s starting pitcher redshirt senior Caden Kaelber was up and down on Sunday. The 6-foot-7 right-hander with a funky three-quarters arm slot allowed three runs in the first two innings, but settled down in the middle parts of the game. At one point, he retired eight straight Trojan hitters. 
Martin-Grudzielanek got the Trojans on the board again in the bottom of the fifth inning with a two-RBI double to the right-center gap. He had a huge game going 2-for-4 with a double, a triple and two RBIs. 
Sophomore right-handed pitcher Fisher Johnson came in relief for Trojans in the sixth inning, who then surrendered one run on an RBI double down the left field from junior right fielder Bryce Matthews.
Freshman center fielder Austin Overn kept the run party going in the bottom of the seventh inning with an RBI base hit. The freshman speedster had his 14th two-hit game of the season, having two or more hits in his fourth straight game.
“[Overn’s] a terrific, young baseball player,” Stankiewicz said. “He understands his role to get on base, hit line drives. He hit a homerun yesterday, but his approach has got to be line drive line drive, so he’s meant the world and he’s worked hard.”
Senior right-handed pitcher Kyle Wisch and redshirt senior right-handed pitcher Garrett Clarke closed the door on the Cougars, achieving quick 1-2-3 innings for the eighth and ninth innings. This was Clarke’s fourth save on the season. The Trojans finalized their third straight Pac-12 series win to start off conference play in a 6-3 victory against the Cougars.
“We got a long way to go,” Stankiewicz said. “Their understanding of the importance of just showing up everyday, working hard, putting in the work and having the right attitude. Every game is an opportunity to prove ourselves and I think they’re starting to understand that and not so much worrying about the past.”
The Trojans are looking to carry their momentum into a midweek matchup at UC Irvine and another Pac-12 series over the weekend at Utah.
“We know that Irvine is good. We haven’t been particularly good on midweeks,” Stankiewicz said. “The challenge in front of us is to not look at a midweek as anything less than a weekend, so I think that’s part of our development as a program. Every time we play is an opportunity to show ourselves well.”
The Trojans head to Irvine in a non-conference matchup with the Anteaters Tuesday at 6 p.m.

The warm oranges of this past Saturday afternoon shifted to a deep, inviting purple, as students streamed into McCarthy Quad for an evening of food, festivities and feminist celebration for the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment’s annual Femfest.
Femfest is a counter-patriarchal music festival that highlights woman-identifying and nonbinary musicians. This year it was organized by SAGE Femfest co-executive directors and seniors majoring in music industry Fenner Osmond-Friedman and Grace Szafara.
The Femfest directors’ team tripled in size from last year with the creation of subcommittees, making this spring’s production the biggest yet. Planning for the festival began over the summer and the team officially started production in August. In the leadup to the spring’s festival, the Femfest team also hosts a number of fundraising events, such as its Halloween party, Hexxfest, and a drag bingo fundraiser at Hamburger Mary’s.
Through music, art and dance, Femfest not only celebrates woman-identifying and queer artists, but also works to provide a community and place of visibility for students and campus organizations.
 “We want to use the festival as a place for these member orgs to be seen,” Osmand-Friedman said. “We seek out member orgs that align with our mission and give them a space to … talk about their organization to the attendees of Femfest.”
The festival featured booths run by the Environmental Student Assembly, which handed out free compost bins to students, and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, which offered a free T-shirt painting station. She is the Music, a nonprofit organization and global network of women in the music industry, also sponsored the event and operated an information booth for students.
The festival kicked off with a DJ set by Glamtech. Offstage, Glamtech is known as Dani Espinoza, a senior majoring in music industry. Espinoza said she wanted to embrace the feminine energy and empowerment of the night. 
“I want the girls to shout from the rooftops,” she said. 
Outside of DJing, Espinoza also produces her own music and wants to support fellow artists in the industry. 
“It means a lot to me to be able to showcase and share the empowered feelings that I’ve been having,” Espinoza said.
G Luné opened with a solo set of original indie pop tracks including her 2021 hit singles “BLOCKED” and “MICHELLE.” Students crowded toward the stage to dance and cheer along as the live music reverberated across the center of campus.
The act that followed, Jenevieve, a Miami-raised artist whose single “Baby Powder” became a streaming hit in 2021, performed an R&B-pop fusion set with music from her debut album “Division.” Accompanied by her talented keyboardist, Jenevieve led the audience into a new, mellow energy. 
The headliner, Chappell Roan, a Missouri-born artist and TikTok sensation, took over the stage with her band in matching silver outfits for her first festival performance. The band amped up the intensity with electronic pop punk riffs and dark ballads. The buzz of anticipation kept audience members dancing and singing along at the stagefront.
“I know most of [Roan’s] music and I’ve never seen her perform, so I’m excited. It’s gotten me through a lot,” said Talis Kroehler, a sophomore majoring in film and television production.
Chappell performed several of her recently released hit singles such as “Pink Pony Club” and “Casual,” as well as some new tracks from an upcoming album projected to release in September. Interspersed between songs, Chappell spoke about her queer feminine identity and guided the audience into an original cheer dance to back up the tracks.
“[‘Casual’] got me through some tough moments,” said Dulce Mejia, a sophomore majoring in film and television production. “I want to support female-identifying artists on and off campus — it’s a night for the girls.”
Students in the audience shared their appreciation for Femfest and their desires to see it expand in the future, including extended advertising for the event on campus. 
“There should be more marketing,” Mejia said. “They deserve more hype. They’re putting in a lot of work and we’ve got great artists … I just want their hard work to be appreciated to its fullest ability.”
Many audience members were excited to participate at the artistic booths and vendors and wanted to see the visual arts at FemFest expand to include more student art vendors and individual creative booths, like a poetry stand.
“A lot of people need more incentive to come and support female artists,” said Isha Ceesay, a sophomore majoring in political science and 3D animation.
As the festival continues to grow, the executive directors want to see Femfest become a campus-wide name.
“In general, the events industry is very cis het white dominated,” Osmond-Friedman said. “For the future of Femfest to be a part of that change, but in bigger and more impactful ways year by year, would be really great to see … My hope for the future is that it gains as much traction as it can on the USC campus and becomes a name that you recognize in conversation.”
The hard work of the team paid off as the festival closed to cheers across McCarthy Quad.
“It’s truly a team effort,” Szafara said. “We couldn’t have gotten it done without every single person on our committee …We were a great team, and I think that the nature, scale, and quality of the event was a complete reflection of our team on every level.”

The USC Housing Law and Policy Clinic hosted the “Know Your Rights” workshop Monday afternoon, with the goal of aiding students who are new to renting a property and explaining different protections for renters on the state, county and city levels.
The workshop is a partnership between the HLPC and Undergraduate Student Government. HLPC is a new organization under the Gould School of Law in which students study issues related to housing insecurity and work with other organizations in the South Central community to support people who are at risk of eviction. USG Vice President Nivea Krishnan facilitated and spearheaded the project.
“It was the school’s responsibility to [educate students about renting] because they’re the ones that don’t guarantee housing all four years,” said Krishnan, a junior majoring in public policy and economics. “That puts the burden on them to make sure students are informed, not just about their options for housing, but how to go about renting in the first place.”
During the presentation, students working with the HLPC explained topics such as renting contracts, the procedure for rent increases and the process of creating a subleasing agreement — when a tenant transfers their leasing agreement to a new tenant.
“Subleasing was very helpful because I know a lot of people are subleasing on Facebook Marketplace or whatever,” said Nancy Shao, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “I’ve already signed my lease personally, but I did do the annoying thing where I read through all of it and then contested a part of it and had them do a written agreement that they would amend one part of it.”
Students in the HLPC discussed best practices to avoid losing a security deposit, such as taking photo and video evidence of damage before moving in, and accommodations that a tenant is entitled to request to increase accessibility — such as the ability to live with a support animal or to request housing near a parking space. 
The presentation also addressed legal protections against eviction, which has become increasingly relevant with new legislation establishing “just cause” protections for the city of Los Angeles.
“Just cause” protections are a specific list of reasons that a landlord may use to evict a tenant, limiting the potential for unjust evictions. The L.A. City Council approved the protections in late January and finalized them in February. Deepika Sharma, the founding director of the HLPC and a professor at Gould, said the protections are part of a larger tenant’s protection package the Council has been working on, such as establishing situations in which a tenant gets relocation assistance.
“The way the law works in California, you could have a rent increase of 40% one day,” Sharma said. “If that’s the case … at the very least you’ll qualify for a relocation … These ‘just cause’ measures are going to apply and help, I think the last estimate was over 300,000 units in the city.”
However, other tenants’ protections are about to expire, potentially putting numerous families at risk of eviction. In late February, the L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to end the County’s coronavirus state of emergency March 31. This will put an end to the protection that allowed tenants to cite the coronavirus pandemic as a reason to delay rent payments.
“There’s a feeling of, what are we supposed to do?” Sharma said. “You can look and research upcoming ballot proposals [and] you can use your voice in making general comments to support policies. So I think there’s a role for everybody, and the clinic is just specifically trying to harness that, in one sense in the legal community, but also share with all students their own rights and how they can be part of it as well.”

No. 2 USC competed at home for the first time in over a month Saturday and put on a show for their fans, securing their 20th win of the year in dominant fashion, beating the Indiana Hoosiers 16-4. 
Redshirt senior driver Paige Hauschild, redshirt senior driver Grace Tehaney and redshirt senior utility Bayley Weber all picked hat tricks to lead USC to the win, with Hauschild and Tehaney each scoring three and Weber slotting four. Despite the dominance of the trifecta, the Trojans made sure everyone got involved, with eight different players netting goals. 
The Trojans got rolling from the opening sprint and proved to be a difficult force to stop all match long. By the time the first media timeout struck with three minutes remaining in the first half, they already had a commanding 4-1 lead. 
Indiana had multiple chances to trim their deficit before the first quarter came to a close though, including a three shot possession followed by a breakaway in the final seconds. However, senior goalkeeper Carolyne Stern was a brick wall in the net for USC, thwarting Indiana with four first quarter blocks.
The second quarter was a similar story, as the Trojans continued to apply pressure and widened their lead to 9-2 by halftime. The first half was capped off with Stern serving a long-ball in transition to Hauschild, who found herself on a breakaway and took advantage, scoring her third goal of the contest. 
Indiana seemed to have newfound life when the second half got underway, as they picked up some early stops and were able to nab their third goal of the game when senior utility Zoe Crouch slipped one past Stern. 
Nonetheless, the Trojans weren’t rattled in the slightest and held the Hoosiers in check for the rest of the period. USC tacked on three goals of their own as well, courtesy of Tehaney and Weber, securing their hat tricks. 
The Trojans would keep their foot on the gas throughout the fourth quarter, outscoring the Hoosiers 4-1 in the final frame and cruising to a commanding 16-4 victory.
It was a dazzling game in goal for Stern, who made eight saves and picked up a steal.  
“[Stern’s] an anchor to our defense,” Weber said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “It allows us to be able to capitalize on their mistakes knowing that she’ll save us.” 
It was not only a great game on the defensive end for Stern, but for the Trojans as a whole. This was only the fourth time this season that they’ve been able to hold their opponent to less than five goals.
“The defense sets the tone,” said Head Coach Marko Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “The defense was executed exactly as we prepared, we took away their style of play and their weapons as we planned on and the score shows that.”
With the victory, the Trojans improved to 20-1 on the year. They’ll be back in action Saturday, when they host San Jose State at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

Disabled people are sexy, want sex, have sex and are fucking great at it too — I’d know, I’m one of them. It’s Women’s History Month, so let’s consensually peel back the metaphorical panties behind the all-too-common misconception that disabled people aren’t sexual beings. 
First off, I’m hot. It’s just a fact. But when I became chronically ill and disabled as a 21 year old, I lost a lot of self-confidence. When I was in so much pain and I hadn’t showered or shaved anywhere for weeks, I didn’t feel attractive. While grappling with the limitations of my new, chronically ill body and all its incurable diseases, suddenly the song, “Your Body Is a Wonderland,” became less of a romantically endearing John Mayer tune and more of a literal sexual identity crisis. 
During this crisis, I felt like I was forced through a second pubescent sexual awakening. Instead of middle school level questions like “What if it hurts?” or “What’s that clear goop in my underwear?”, now, the questions had graduated to “How do I tell my partner in a sexy way that I can’t do that position because it exacerbates my chronic pain?” and “Will any of my medications affect my libido?”
Reclaiming my sexiness as a newly disabled woman meant breaking down a lot of my own internalized ableist and patriarchal ideas of beauty, which was a lonely trek because the conversation around disability and sex seems non-existent. For a while, that made me feel like having a disability made me inherently less sexy. Now that I’ve lived with my illnesses for four years, I’ve learned that is far from the truth, so I’m here to provide my sex wisdom. 
My first and most important sex wisdom is a skill I refined as a result of having to take a two and a half year medical leave of absence during the pandemic. I was in no shape to start anything romantic or had any interest in sex, but I did have plenty of time to get to know my body. Getting to know my body so intimately as a result of my worsening health led to some ease in figuring out what felt good down there, what positions were most comfortable, what turns me on and what time of day I get horny. Ultimately, getting comfortable masturbating also meant overcoming the taboo that women don’t. These were all ways of getting to know my body’s limits before I could communicate them effectively and confidently to a partner. 
The next tip comes from years of evolving into a fierce self advocate in the doctor’s office and in fighting insurance. Clear communication is everything — inside and outside of the bedroom. If it’s later in the evening and I’ve taken my sleepy time meds, nothing is going to happen after that, and I make that clear to my partner. If I have a migraine, I know the effort it takes to have sex will exacerbate it, so I’ll switch to a cozy morning rendezvous in the sheets the next morning while I recover the evening before. Ultimately, saying yes to the needs of my body before fulfilling the needs of a sexual partner, or anyone for that matter, is paramount. 
Another tip is to utilize equipment — not dildos and vibrators, although those can be an incredible asset in sex with a disabled partner. I’m talking about shower chairs, pillows and ice packs, which were game-changers for me. Get dizzy in the shower? Sit in your shower chair, or use it to play with levels during a steamy encounter. Struggle with L4/L5 joint pain? Grab a pillow for under the knees or slide it up to the lower back for some supported missionary. Fibromyalgia making it painful to move your shoulders? Grab an ice pack for your traps or use it for some sensual temperature play. Overstimulated visual field by bright lights? Throw on a blindfold for some relief and turn it into a sexy sensory experience of touch. 
There are other important factors to consider as a chronically ill or disabled person that occur outside the bedroom such as the influence of medications on pregnancy risk, and more, which require consulting a doctor. Then there’s the presence of caretakers — I remember at my sickest thinking, “Will I ever be well enough to live on my own and have privacy to be a young woman with sexual freedom?” Fortunately for me, I am now able to live independently, but, for example, wheelchair users may not be able to. However, that doesn’t mean wheelchair users are less sexual, it just requires forethought and planning, which isn’t unsexy.
While a lot of my tips apply to anyone getting freaky, the disabled sexual experience is unique and can teach us all how to be better sexual partners. Sexual health is a part of overall health and, in the end, disabled people want to have sex, too — don’t leave us out of the fun.

If you would have told me five years ago that I would be writing about fashion and technology in the same piece, I would have laughed in your face.
With fashion being such a physical, materialistic industry, it seems almost impossible that it would be tied into the digital world. The average consumer can’t necessarily own the internet, and definitely cannot wear it. But what my 15-year-old mind would neglect to consider is Web3 and AI. 
Last Wednesday, the Business of Fashion held its BoF Professional Summit: An Inflection Point in Fashion Tech, hosted by Bolt. Leaders from top businesses such as Gucci and StockX, and tech start-ups such as Quilt.AI, engaged in fantastic discussions about data collection for better appeal of target audiences, quantum marketing in the age of instant consumer feedback and experimenting with Web3 — which uses blockchain in an extension of cryptocurrency — and the metaverse. 
Soon after the summit, though, Levi’s, which was also represented, announced it is beginning to test AI models for its website. If it succeeds, this is an absolute game changer — let me explain why. 
First, a rendering that looks just like a person will directly jeopardize and possibly replace the modeling industry. Modeling will revert back to a strict catwalk and editorial basis, and commercial models will no longer exist. With the falling economy, wiping out the entire industry seems like a possibility, but now, one with a higher likelihood.
Secondly, with quantum marketing, we could be giving AI and the internet even more information about us. Explained in author and CMO Raja Rajamannar’s book “Quantum Marketing: Mastering the New Marketing Mindset for Tomorrow’s Consumers,” companies and digital platforms already have an incredulous amount of information that we’ve willingly surrendered — either through in-the-heat rants or quickly clicking “accept all cookies” every time we go to a website. Quantum marketing could further constrict, or rather more precisely prescribe better boundaries, surrounding data and privacy on an online marketplace. 
With AI and customization capabilities, customers may be able to put in their own measurements or scans of themselves to see a garment on a similar body or even on their meta-selves before hitting “checkout.” Consequently, even in this extreme hypothetical, another business may be eradicated: physical stores.
Some companies have already attempted to make online shopping experiences hyper-personalized. Skims, Savage X Fenty and Good American have taken a courageous and deservedly-applauded effort at diversity and inclusivity when shopping online by offering photos of different models wearing different sizes of the same garment. Still, they were models nonetheless. 
As these companies implement more personalized features and as Levi’s continues to work with LaLaLand.ai on its marriage with the digital world, the runway also has not shied away from the challenge of virtualization. 
In Milan fashion week, Shanghai-based brand KWK by Kay Kwok used ChatGPT to produce the lyrics for his show, and Christopher Kane used AI to design the animal prints for his collection. But two standouts for me were in Paris at Coperni FW23 and Anrealage FW23. 
Still on the media buzz high from its last collection when it sprayed its dress onto Bella Hadid, Coperni incorporated “Spot,” the Boston Dynamic robot. Having its own moment on the runway, the different “Spots” would interact directly with the models in various ways, ranging from holding and handing off bags to taking jackets off. While this friendship between humans and robots was incredibly beautiful, it still felt a little under-performed. 
Maybe the simplicity overshadowed the exciting layers underneath, but it may also be the residual excitement from the Bella Hadid sprayed dress performance slowly wearing off. It’s hard to maintain expectations once you go viral and even harder to make something new viral. Just to be clear, I believe more strongly in the latter as Coperni still debuted an incredibly strong collection. 
More exciting to me, though, was Kunihiko Morinaga’s experiment with UV tubes and pattern emergence in Anrealage. When models emerged in simple, well-tailored coats, they would step onto a platform and a UV tube would slowly move up the models, revealing brightly colored, complex and compelling patterns on the clothes and transforming the beige and cream coates into warm, spring-time pinks, yellows and blues. 
Looking at the collection under the eye of fashion as art, it was adventurous, bold and a positively whimsical fever-dream experience. Still, though, I have to remind myself about practicality. Yes this technology can change how people approach clothing and shopping, but how sustainable is it? Are the UV lights harmful? How much will it cost to own one? And what about maintenance fees? 
Incorporating technology is an incredibly difficult thing to do, but a necessary one as we grow toward an increasingly digital world. Maybe you think the incorporation of tech is a necessary or unnecessary evil, but I don’t see the point of rejecting the inevitable.
So instead of stressing about all the things that could go wrong, let’s also take a moment to consider all the positive possibilities that we have yet to even fathom. With creativity and curiosity, the digital sky’s the limit, so let’s all take a deep breath, and together we can put one (meta)foot in front of the other.

Economists, bankers and traders from around the world had their eyes trained on the Federal Reserve Wednesday as it announced an interest rate hike of 25 basis points, despite fears it could tack onto turmoil in the banking sector. 
Prior to the March 10 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the second largest bank failure in United States history, traders in the futures market predicted a 70% chance that the Fed would double its prevailing 25 basis point interest rate hikes of the past month. Less than two weeks — and three failed banks — later, the Fed instead had to weather concerns that any increase in interest rates at all would further destabilize the financial sector and tip the economy into a precarious state.
Markets reacted to Wednesday’s announcement with turbulence. Heavy sell-offs on both Wednesday and Friday were succeeded by small recoveries. Trading on Friday, especially, saw Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest bank, lose 7% of its value in the morning before recovering roughly half of that by closing, stoking fears that it could be the next in line to fall. Nonetheless, Sanjay Sharma, an adjunct professor of finance, said the Fed did “absolutely the right thing” given the present circumstances.
“It’s really hard to say right now whether these 25 basis points will exacerbate the bank problem, or if it will reduce the fears of inflation,” Sharma said. “If the Fed didn’t raise interest rates, then I would be more concerned about long-term inflation. If this is a shot in the arm to fight inflation, and that is my perception, then I would say I think inflation will be more contained, but the Fed has a very, very difficult job.”
Controlling inflation has been top of the agenda for central banks around the world, including the Fed, since mid-2021. U.S. inflation currently sits slightly above 6%, below the peak of 9% in June, but well above its 2% target. However, the collapses of several regional U.S. banks, as well as the trouble that has hit Deutsche Bank and 167-year old Swiss giant Credit Suisse, have industry economists scrambling to find out whether the Fed would be overcooking its response to inflation by increasing interest rates.
Depositors are moving en masse from regional banks to perceived safer, larger banks. Experts say that in this current uncertain market, these banks are less likely to lend, which may give rise to a ‘credit crunch’: consumers with less access to cash, spend less, thus creating disinflationary pressures. Goldman Sachs wrote in an article that this will come to serve as an effective rate hike of 25 to 50 basis points, while Torsten Slok of Apollo Global Management wrote on its own website that it was worth 150 basis points. 
“We’re going to feel the effects,” said Rodney Ramcharan, a professor of finance at the Marshall School of Business. “A lot of bank lending is going to slow down and inflation will begin to come down quite rapidly in the next three to nine months.”
Billionaire Bill Ackman argued on Twitter that the Fed should have stopped any interest rate hike, while Elon Musk tweeted that the “Fed needs to drop the rate by at least 50 [basis points].” Economists at Japanese bank Nomura Holdings also suggested cutting rates. Despite this, Ramcharan said that the Fed’s 25 basis point hike was a “reasonable position to take.”
“Alternatively, they could have not changed it, but I think the inflation outlook is still tricky,” Ramcharan said.
The initial share sell-off was triggered by the collapse of SVB. A key lender to early-stage businesses in the U.S., the bank fell into the hands of federal regulators after a call to raise funds backfired and rang alarm bells for swathes of customers who withdrew their cash until the bank was no longer able to pay them back. 
“The collapse of SVB, at least in the startup circles I’ve been in, has definitely been a wake up call,” said Joshua Wolk, a sophomore majoring in business administration.
As SVB was falling, pressure increased on banks deemed by investors to be at a similar risk of funding pressures and illiquidity. Silvergate, the fintech- and crypto-oriented bank, failed the same day, and Signature Bank broke down two days later. The SVB and Signature crashes are now two of the three largest bank failures in U.S. history. 
Fears of contagion spread beyond America. When Credit Suisse announced it had found “material weaknesses” in its financial reporting procedures, it compounded the effects and had to be rescued, with the Swiss central authority brokering a deal worth $3.2 billion for its rival, UBS, to purchase it March 19. 
“The failure of Credit Suisse would have been an absolute disaster. It would have caused a real chain reaction,” Sharma said. “That’s why the central bank basically handcuffed UBS and said, ‘You’ve got to buy this bank.’”
While successful in its end result, UBS’ shotgun acquisition of Credit Suisse added further distress to the European markets. Big banks, such as Société Générale, UniCredit and, most significantly, Deutsche Bank, lost substantial share value after a controversial decision to impose the full losses of the deal onto some of Credit Suisse’s bondholders rather than its shareholders upended the norm, and even its own investor presentations, for deals of this nature.
At the behest of the Swiss regulator, investors into Credit Suisse did not lose everything. This burden instead fell onto unsuspecting Contingent Convertible bondholders who saw their positions, worth a total $17 billion, wiped out — a move that brought uncertainty to European bond markets. While CoCo bonds were trading at nearly 78% of face value in early March, they have most recently been trading at single-digit prices. 
The situation has opened itself up to criticism about CoCo bonds, Sharma said. He said he doesn’t think “there’s any point in having them at all.”
CoCo bonds date back to the Great Recession of 2008, after which taxpayers were made to pay billions of dollars in bank bailouts. European financial institutions created a new high-yield, high-risk bond that could be issued by a bank and divert the risk onto bondholders. When a bank’s capital falls below a certain threshold, the bonds automatically convert into shares of that bank. Sharma likened it to “seeking insurance when your house is already burning.”
“Banking is a confidence-sensitive sector,” Sharma said. “If you are going to shatter that confidence by calling on CoCo bonds, you are going to be a train wreck.”
Ramcharan said he also saw an opportunity for the industry to learn from the risk that bondholders have ultimately fallen to, suggesting that there may be “scope for thinking more creatively about why we have this kind of banking system.” 
“Maybe we can begin to explore alternative means of getting cash for firms that are not as risky,” he said.
Ramcharan also pointed to the 2018 rollback of the Dodd-Frank Act, legislation brought in after the Great Recession to improve transparency and reduce risk on American consumers, as a factor for SVB’s collapse. 
“We need to roll back some of those regulatory changes in 2018 and put the cap at $50 billion … again,” Ramcharan said. “We’ve now de facto said that all deposits are more or less insured in the United States. The flip side of that is we need to regulate most of the banks a lot more stringently.”
While federal regulators insure the deposit a bank’s customer makes to a maximum of $250,000, regulatory filings from December 2022 indicate that more than 95% of SVB’s deposits were uninsured. However, three major federal powers — the FDIC, Fed and Treasury — issued a joint statement a few days after the bank’s collapse to ensure all deposits would be made whole.
Within that statement, officials tried to calm investor panic surrounding the industry, calling the U.S. banking system “resilient” and “on a solid foundation, in large part due to reforms that were made after the [2008] financial crisis that ensured better safeguards for the banking industry.”
Wolk said SVB’s collapse and the ongoing situations at First Republic Bank and elsewhere give “a very good sign that whatever the current regulations are, are just clearly not sufficient.”
“SVB gained a lot of popularity for how lax it was about banking rules for startups,” Wolk said. “Typically, it is very difficult to work with a bank just because of all the regulations, but this is definitely a reminder of how high-risk startups are and why it’s good to operate as lean as possible.”
First Republic Bank, which has a similar business model to SVB, has been a particular point of concern for investors. It lost 89% of its share value this month, as of Monday. Eleven larger banks deposited $30 billion into First Republic as a show of confidence in the firm, and the news of SVB’s acquisition by First Citizens Bank saw regional stocks rally on Monday opening. 
In light of rising stock prices, which indicate investor’s restored confidence in the financial sector, Ramcharan suggested that the financial turmoil is not yet a crisis. Rather, he characterized them as “isolated” events against a backdrop of general stresses in the banking sector that are “manageable.”
“The system is fragile, in the sense of these losses now, but it’s not necessarily insolvent,” Ramcharan said.
Correction: A previous version of the deck misstated the date that the Fed increased interest rates. It was March 22, not March 16.
Correction: The Fed’s interest rate hikes prevailed for the past month, not the past 12 months.
