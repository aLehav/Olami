Aria Cataño, Kate Montanez and Catie Cummings spend their Sundays bringing clean water to thousands of people experiencing homelessness on Skid Row. With eight water drops to date, the group has raised more than $365,000 in funds, according to Cataño, and has worked alongside fellow community organizers in Los Angeles to raise awareness about the needs of unhoused populations. 
Inspired by a bag of groceries Cataño and Montanez received at a Black Lives Matter meeting in July, the three took Cataño’s Subaru to pass out burritos to people living outside of City Hall. However, those that they were aiding were still suffering from an inaccessibility to clean water. In Skid Row, there are only five public water fountains for a population of roughly 5,000 people. Community activists have demanded the installation of these fountains for years, but the city has yet to do so.
Realizing that there was still a need to be met, Cataño posted about the demand for water on her Facebook page and raised roughly $2,000 in just one day. These initial donations gave the group the momentum for its first water drop, starting what is now known as Water Drop LA. About 95% of the group’s distribution is at Skid Row, but the team also sends a small supply to the downtown Olvera Street area where it first started passing out the burritos weeks prior.
“The well-being of the people within our communities is the main priority, especially when it’s the fault of oppressive institutions that have impacted them in this way for so long,” Montanez said. “I think a large part of it is just showing up for your community and being part of the fight to dismantle those systems … Water is a human right. So when that right is violated, that needs to be fought for. Our hope is that by eliminating water scarcity in L.A. and beyond, we can also inspire conversation about managing our resources to make sure that there’s social justice while also ensuring the sustainability of our planet.” 
Since the first distribution July 19 where they gave away more than 800 gallons of water, the water drops have been scaling up every weekend, allowing the group to distribute greater amounts more effectively. Each week, the group buys five pallets of gallons of water, which is about 1,500 gallons, as well as two pallets of smaller 16.9-ounce bottles to distribute in case the group runs out or someone cannot carry the big gallons. Fifty to 60 volunteers participate each Sunday, with a waitlist of about 20 additional sign-ups. The volunteers are sorted into about 20 cars filled with water and given different geographical areas to tackle. 
The three founders met while at USC, but became closer over the summer. Cataño and Montanez both graduated from their undergraduate programs in Spring 2020. Cataño is now getting her master’s of urban planning from the Sol Price School of Public Policy. Cummings, a senior majoring in law, history and culture, is taking the fall semester off to work on Water Drop LA full time. 
“Catie [Cummings] and I met in D.C. while we were doing an academic program for USC about two years ago,” Cataño said. “We became friends that way. We lost touch my senior year but reconnected while we were both studying for LSATs. Kate [Montanez] and I met at the beginning of senior year but got closer because we were protesting together, got arrested together and now we’re married for life.”
Also on their board is volunteer coordinator Avery Dukes, a senior majoring in nongovernmental organizations and social change. Dukes puts together the volunteer list, organizes all the signup sheets and checks everyone in on the day of to ensure that all the logistics go smoothly.
“What really drew me to Water Drop is the fact that we are addressing not only water insecurity, but the sources of it, specifically structural racism,” Dukes said. “As a Black woman, that’s something that I really care about. Moving forward, I just would love to see us continue to advocate for changes in government and more structural changes. Ideally we can get to the point where the drops are self-sustaining.”
Given their “unexpected platform” that has reached more than 6,600 followers on Instagram so far, Cataño said the group hopes they can amplify other organizers who have been advocating for change for years and can help push for quicker change. As far as short-term goals, Cataño said Water Drop LA aims to continue and expand water distribution throughout more of L.A. As of now, the group is already working with a handful of community partners in Boyle Heights, Echo Park and West L.A. to sponsor as much water as possible for them to maintain their drops. In the long term, the team’s focus is on city advocacy and systemic change. 
“Kate [Montanez] wrote some beautiful petitions that we’ve been trying to circulate that have been getting traction,” Cataño said. “We are just going to keep on trying to get the city’s attention and get into conversations with them to make sure that they know that this is a problem that they can’t just keep on pushing back.”
Assistant professor of writing Emily Artiano has been a mentor to the team since the very beginning, teaching founder Cataño in her freshman Writing 150 course. Artiano has connected the organization with contacts and provided guidance through her own experience teaching about equity and homelessness in L.A.
“I am so impressed with how they are so consistent about having an anti-savior positioning,” Artiano said. “Instead they recognize that we are the community. This is our responsibility — responsibility to be addressing these issues and the social injustices and I just think that it’s something that’s missing often in community work.”
Jacob Totaro, a senior majoring in environmental engineering and engineering management, runs his own nonprofit organization called Torch, which manufactures covers called Torch Tiles that regulate temperatures and humidity levels inside tents for people experiencing homelessness or refugee populations. Totaro distributes these tent covers at the water drops on Sundays. Totaro said that the work Water Drop LA does allows for USC students to be proactive within the surrounding neighborhoods.
“They’re doing an amazing job of mobilizing USC students to step outside of the USC bubble and impact the community in a better way,” Totaro said. “We come from such privileged backgrounds being at USC and having one of the top educations in the world. Students aren’t really driven to use that education or use those skills for better things. I think that Water Drop has really been able to use their experience in policy and marketing to grow this huge grassroots initiative.”
The Water Drop LA team said it has been very strict about making sure all of its volunteers are coronavirus-cautious to ensure the safety of one another and the safety of those they are serving. All volunteers are given gloves to wear while they pass out and handle the water. Before volunteers are sent with their groups, they are reminded to keep their masks on and practice social distancing. On each volunteer’s liability waiver, there is also a coronavirus questionnaire checking for symptoms and any potential exposure.
“Having any sort of event, let alone a volunteer event in a pandemic is a challenge,” Cummings said. “So from week one, we’ve been very strict about making sure everyone has masks at all times. Additionally, we’ve been able to get a bunch of donations of masks, so we’re passing them out whenever we have them, which is awesome because they’re one of the most frequently requested items when we’re passing out water.”
Cummings said that not only has Water Drop LA allowed volunteers to become engaged with their communities through learning individuals’ unique stories, but they are also able to change perceptions of the unhoused population in L.A. 
“A lot of people bring up concerns about safety or the community that we are working in,” Cummings said. “If you talk to any of our volunteers or any of us, most people will tell you that our favorite part has been the connections we’ve made and the people that we’ve met. All of our volunteers are able to [build] genuine relationships with people which has been really cool and really helpful, as well as expanding people’s views of unhoused communities and perceptions of them.”

During a typical on-campus semester, students with disabilities can face numerous learning barriers such as commutes between classes, medically and psychologically related absences and lack of accommodations outside the classroom. 
The virtual setting of online classes has helped with some of these issues as students find many learning barriers eliminated.
“People with disabilities may miss a lecture due to [personal] reasons,” said Kimi Zamora, a senior majoring in biomedical engineering and assistant director of the Student Assembly for Accessibility. “Now they can watch [class recordings] and get the same content that they would normally miss with an in-person semester. So, I’ve honestly heard a lot of great feedback about the online semester from people with disabilities.” 
Some students with disabilities said remote learning has allowed them to attend class in a more comfortable environment. Alternatively, other students with disabilities have found that online instruction has led to auditory, visual and kinesthetic difficulties. Despite the helpful effects the switch to remote learning has created for some students, others may encounter newfound troubles.
While the mission of Disability Services and Programs is to eliminate disability-related obstacles, this department within USC has begun to offer online services for students who have a wide range of medical conditions, injuries and learning disabilities. Some of these services include online proctoring in a small personal group, exam practice sessions, assistive technology training, reading scribes, large font settings, extended testing time, interpreters and live captionists.
Another component DSP has recently added is a “best practice” resource, which details how students could partake in good ergonomics while adjusting to remote learning. DSP’s services are also open to students who find themselves struggling under certain circumstances in class and seek a higher level of support, even if they have not been formally diagnosed with a disability.
“Ultimately, we’re working to ensure that the students get their accommodations and that they’re going through the most similar experience as their peers in the class,” said Lisa Toft, director of DSP.
Through many committees, discussions and collaborations with different departments ranging from technological support and housing to external service providers, DSP has been working to ensure that remote learning will not pose a barrier to those with disabilities. After a thorough analysis over the summer, DSP found that they were able to provide a larger quantity of services on a broader, faster and more flexible scale to students online without concerns of social distancing or a limited schedule. 
“We have a great team of problem-solvers who put a plan together very quickly,” Toft said. “There’s been very little impact on students. There’s been some uncertainty because everything changed … but we’ve gotten great feedback on the services we’ve been able to provide students.”
Despite its efforts, DSP cannot physically assist students with some aspects of learning. While they can provide resources, an online setting may leave students with disabilities to navigate accommodations, such as acquiring a private room or concentration methods, on their own.
“I feel like there’s a lot that’s on the students for us to do instead — we have to provide [accomodations] for ourselves because there’s really not much that they can do,” said an anonymous transfer student who wanted to keep her learning disability private. “One accommodation I have for testing is having a private room and having natural lighting and [DSP] usually does that, but now I have to figure it out myself. I feel they’re doing the best that they can, but not as much as they usually can just given the circumstances.”
In lieu of face-to-face assistance, DSP specialists have begun to provide individual Zoom meetings so that students can connect and share their troubles and triumphs.
Some students with disabilities seem to be supported at a higher level as most classes are recorded, mute and video off options are available and students can message their professors confidentially. Like students, professors must adapt to the online format and search for new ways to make their learning approaches accessible to all students online.
In addition to the new components of remote learning, Julie Van Dam, an associate professor of French who teaches a class on global narratives of disability, promotes accessible learning for all students since there may be instances where students face difficulty documenting their disability. 
Van Dam believes that through virtual learning, professors are able to more clearly see and address what needs their students have and provide support accordingly. 
“I feel that professors are definitely more able to see why accessibility matters,” Van Dam said. “I think that there can be an assumption that a student is trying to get away with something, and now, it’s been a very clear reminder or just an awakening to the broad kinds of accessible learning modalities that we have to embrace.” 
For some students with disabilities, remote learning may be preferable to taking courses on campus. According to the Student Accessibility Assembly, students with disabilities have pushed for the option of online courses during in-person semesters. Student representatives in the assembly work with DSP and the greater Undergraduate Student Government to create more resources, policies and community for students with disabilities on campus. 
“If you think about having to miss class for health reasons, like having to go to doctor’s appointments or doing lab blood work, [those are] usually some things that I have to do where I have to miss class,” said Lana Bridi, a co-director of SAA. “I’m no longer worried about missing something because classes are recorded. I can have that be online as a resource. So I think in some ways, this virtual learning environment is like an opportunity to reevaluate how we usually do things especially in terms of accessibility for students like the learning environment.” 
Javin D’Souza, a co-director of SAA, said that for some students with disabilities, this semester has been the first time they can attend class without feeling like their disability may be perceived as a distraction. Now, students who have verbal tics, physical illnesses or other disabilities that would cause them to draw back from participation can mute themselves while still present in class. Some students cannot be mentally or physically present in class, and remote learning still allows them to listen to a lecture in real time. 
“If I’m ill that day of class and I can’t come in,” D’Souza said, “There’s a lot of power to being able to mute your microphone and turn off your video while still being able to listen in because otherwise, I just lose that educational time.”
Still, other students with disabilities have found that the transition to remote learning has been challenging. People with auditory disabilities, for instance, may have difficulty hearing through their computer speakers. 
“Students can’t really hear with the online platform,” Zamora said. “They will have to look at transcripts, but the transcripts on Zoom don’t necessarily transcribe as well as they can or as accurately as they should.”
An anonymous junior who has an auditory disability does not wish to be identified due to her claim about DSP’s frequent instances of miscommunication, including one when DSP misscheduled her captioner on her first week of school because they were understaffed at the time. According to the student, the process of communicating and getting accommodations could be very disheartening.
“I think it’s such a large university, so all of the departments in schools are removed from each other,” the student said. “There’s kind of a mix of synchronization that can make it very difficult to get accommodation.”
While Toft wrote in an email that they could not confirm the incident without knowing who the student was, she said DSP services are considered to be a partnership between the University, student, vendor and the department itself with reliance on students to get in touch regarding any changes to their class schedule.
“The University has supported the growth and expansion of DSP resources, including staff, to reflect the growing number of students registering with our office,” Toft wrote. “We are certainly very busy at the start of a semester, as all offices at the University are. However, I don’t see understaffing as a root concern.”
The anonymous junior also says that students with disabilities and their accommodations should be met with decency, preparation, communication and respect.
“People are constantly typing, which is nice for deaf and hard of hearing people,” the student said. “But also I wouldn’t say it’s preferable because the online experience is super taxing, and it’s difficult to communicate regardless of whether you’re disabled.”
On the other hand, Zamora said remote learning has helped her and other students with physical or mobile disabilities. 
“I’m able to just hop into an online meeting and say ‘hi’ and don’t have to worry about it being in a non-accessible classroom,” Zamora said. “I can interact with whoever I want to because it’s not like lecture style seating where everybody sits in the middle, and if you’re in a wheelchair, you’re off to the side … I don’t have to worry about my disability for the first time in education.” 
While the University takes multiple measures to provide accessibility for all students, there are still a number of accessibility issues on campus that pose as a barrier for students with disabilities. Zamora said that most public transportation available aside from the bus is not wheelchair accessible. While the Disabled Access to Road Transportation Program was created to serve as transportation for students with disabilities, a wheelchair-accessible vehicle is only provided given a request ahead of time. Also, Ubers, taxis and friends’ cars are also often wheelchair inaccessible, and Zamora said some students with disabilities could be left out of pre-coronavirus social gatherings and extracurricular activities. 
There are some students that find online learning challenging, as it is a new territory all USC students must endeavor. Remote learning may bring about technological difficulties and lack of social interaction; however, for students with physical disabilities, it may bring the ease of not having to worry about class commutes and navigating poorly accessible classrooms.
“Technical difficulties can be solved through learning, but people with disabilities can’t be solved independently and it’s a systemic issue,” Zamora said. “Technical difficulties can be solved with a day, a week rate if proper research is done, however, with a disability, this is lifelong. This affects as long as it takes to graduate. This isn’t like a one time short issue. This is people’s lives and their lifestyles that are non optional.” 
As SAA remains strong and knowledgeable of their Americans with Disabilities Act rights, they have also demonstrated that they will continue to hold the University accountable to make sure its needs are met. 
“My parents told me from a young age that if I don’t learn to speak up, nobody will look down to talk to me,” Zamora said. “As shocking as that may seem to say to a 6-year-old, I did have to really speak up and learn how to talk to people. I had to yell, I’m usually very soft spoken — I used to not really talk to anyone. For the sake of my career and for the sake of my education and for the sake of my social interaction, I have learned to be outspoken and independent, and that is something I fight for every day.” 
One in five college students across the nation has some type of disability, whether all students with disabilities at USC are registered with DSP or not. Many students that learn they have a disability find out later in their education. 
Students who have benefitted from online learning so far hope the platform remains as an option to help make USC classes more accessible for everyone on campus. 
“I hope that there’s more training on that too, for professors to understand that these accommodations also aren’t … dropping your standards,” D’Souza said. “It’s just that people need more time to do things or they need basically more access to resources to be on the same playing field as everybody else.”

The death of actor Chadwick Boseman last week was equally shocking as it was devastating. With lead roles in blockbuster films such as “42” and Marvel’s “Black Panther,” Boseman was an icon for Black cinema across the nation. As the world mourns his loss, it is also important to honor what he and his career represented. Boseman’s role as King T’Challa was the first time a Black actor was at the forefront of a blockbuster Marvel movie — bringing in $1.3 billion in box office revenue and coming in at the top-five highest-grossing Marvel films; this role shot Boseman to stardom.
Boseman’s role as King T’Challa is deeply symbolic of the changes occurring in Hollywood, especially when looking back to the 2015 Oscars and subsequent #OscarsSoWhite callout. Only five years since activist April Reign coined the hashtag, the world has witnessed a breathtaking array of cinema choc-full of diversity and representation on the big screen. Movies such as Jordan Peele’s “Us” and “Get Out” as well as Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman,” to name a few. These films will undoubtedly go down in history as masterpieces of visual storytelling. Whether they are remembered for their iconic cinematography, multicultural cast lists, or prolific directors of color, these films signify a tremendous moment for Black cinema in Hollywood. No matter how accomplished these movies may be, one cannot ignore the fact that films of this nature are still very sparse amongst box office chart toppers in Hollywood. 
On-screen portrayals of underrepresented groups appear to be on the rise. However, according to a 2019 report from the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, there is little to no such change occurring behind the cameras and in the writing rooms. According to this report, only 16.9% of film directors were from underrepresented groups, and only 4.5% of film directors were women. When one of the most diverse lists of nominees in Oscars history was announced in 2019, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ alleged commitment to diversity seemed it was paying off  — but not a year later, all hope was lost. 
The 2020 Oscars list of nominees and winners looked strikingly similar to that of 2015’s, noting only one Black acting nominee —  Cynthia Erivo in “Harriet.” While Bong Joon-ho’s “Parasite” was the first foreign-language film to win Best Picture, this victory should not overshadow the lack of diversity within all other categories. The 2020 revival of #OscarsSoWhite demonstrates that equity in visual storytelling and film cannot be established solely through representation on the big screen. Issues of underrepresentation will continue to permeate the industry unless an institutional change occurs. While it’s great to see more faces of color on-screen, there needs to be more equitable representation of marginalized groups in writing rooms, director’s chairs, casting agencies, nomination boards and executive offices. Simply putting more people of color in front of the camera does not eliminate the pervasive diversity issues in Hollywood.
For Hollywood to demonstrate that its commitments to change and statements of solidarity are not merely performative, significant institutional changes must occur. Without representation in all aspects of the entertainment industry, Hollywood will continue to be a white-washed, male-dominated escapade that ignores the significance of diversity in storytelling through visual media and film.

The transition to college comes with lots of novelty — living alone for the first time, exploring a new campus and meeting people from around the world. For students of color who come from diverse schools or communities, moving to college may also catalyze feelings of culture shock and impostor syndrome. Amid an online semester, the question of whether culture shock and impostor syndrome still affects students of color has certainly not been at the forefront of conversations.
At USC, a top-tier university where white students make up the largest population on campus,  students of color were not immune to the challenges of being underrepresented while in-person classes took place. Unfortunately, and perhaps unsurprisingly, being online for the fall semester has not relieved this challenge. Instead, culture shock and impostor syndrome have taken on new forms. 
Although USC classes now take place on a computer screen, the faces on the screen are still mostly white. Being online does not change the University’s demographics; it also does not change how being a student of color in a Zoom full of white students might feel. Because of the socioeconomic disparities between some students of color and white students, white students tend to have greater access to the internet, laptops and other luxuries. This is also why said students are usually more likely or capable of having their cameras on, having a quiet space to listen to lectures and speaking up the most in class.
A lack of diversity and representation on Zoom likely leads to the same emotions of culture shock that discourage students of color from participating in in-person lectures. Seeing an overwhelmingly white Zoom call can discourage Black and Indigenous students and students of color from turning on their cameras, attending the calls synchronously and maintaining the motivation to listen in class. Being online also does not change the fact that most professors are white, which further creates a barrier and disconnect between Black and Indigenous students, students of color and their teachers. And on a fully online platform, creating relationships is already difficult enough. 
In online schooling, feelings of impostor syndrome have not vanished either. Given the completely impersonal academic environment, isolation has likely, in fact, made it worse: Students are left with their own thoughts and are more susceptible to spiraling down the hole of self-doubt, with no buffer of support groups or face-to-face communication with other students who may be feeling the same way. Moreover, if students are struggling with the transition of a high school to college workload, being remote makes it difficult to form connections with classmates for help. 
Impostor syndrome goes beyond Zoom classes, though: Social media also fuels these emotions for students of color specifically those who are watching as classmates in Los Angeles are making friends, connections and experiencing college life. Experiencing this barrage of content while many Black and Indigenous students, students of color and low-income students are still at home also explains the disconnect between marginalized students and the University.
The truth is that in the digital age of online classes and social media, impostor syndrome and culture shock live on beyond in-person environments. It’s easy to ignore the realities of culture shock and impostor syndrome when everything is online, but this wishful thinking of looking the other way is coming at the expense of Black and Indigenous students, students of color and underrepresented students. 
There is no way to eliminate culture shock on a Zoom call when the USC student body is predominantly white, but by talking about it and validating these emotions, Black and Indigenous students and students of color may feel more comfortable on the Zoom calls to turn on their cameras and participate more often. The same could be said about impostor syndrome. The first step is acknowledging it and creating a space for students to talk about it without being judged. There must be an effort made on the part of the University to help students and share these emotions of impostor syndrome and culture shock — this way, perhaps students can begin to feel like USC’s online classes are a safe space to learn and create community.

With an extra Monday off every September, what’s not to love about Labor Day? The country’s labor force appreciates the holiday, but Labor Day does not receive the recognition that other federal holidays like Memorial Day see. Having a day off of work was a central goal of labor unions over a century ago, along with eight hour work days, child labor laws and myriad other regulations to prevent workers from being exploited.
This Labor Day, it dawned on me that there is a group of nearly 500,000 workers whose labor is still exploited by a billion-dollar cartel in the United States. Despite the immense amount of money in college sports, the NCAA still tries to keep money out of the hands of its athletes. 
USC collects more than $100 million per year in revenue from athletics, with $60 million coming from just the football team. Any university should pay the athletes who generate that revenue, considering it would be a drop in the bucket for schools like USC, already the second-largest private employer in Los Angeles. 
The NCAA often argues that student-athletes are paid with an education. However, it does not mention that only six specific sports on each campus have the ability to give out athletic scholarships that cover the full price of tuition. Sports like football are allowed to give out 85 scholarships per active roster at programs like USC, which can cover the majority of the team. Other sports, like men’s volleyball, can only award 4.5 scholarships per roster to a team of about 20 players. As a result, many student-athletes, like myself, have to pay thousands of dollars to play for their teams.
Aside from the number of scholarships handed out, those scholarships are often contingent on players staying academically eligible. Being a full-time student and a full-time athlete is already taxing enough on the mind and body. An expectation of giving it all on the court then turning around and doing the same in the classroom creates an unhealthy balancing act that student-athletes have to maintain for four years. 
In addition to the refusal to pay athletes directly, the NCAA also prohibits student-athletes from making money off their own name, image and likeness. Although men’s volleyball and football are vastly different sports on many fronts, we are both forced to sign the same compliance forms from the NCAA every year. In contracts as lengthy and complex as Apple’s terms of service, student-athletes are essentially offered the option to let the NCAA profit off them or to not play their season. 
This exploitation of student-athletes by the NCAA has occurred for decades, but developments such as the current pandemic and recent legislation indicate a lot could be changing for college athletes.
ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith explained on “First Take” that if all students return to campus, college football can resume business as usual. However, if a university moves to an all virtual model, “the student-athletes who show up — their employment status is enhanced. As a result, you don’t get to call them amateurs. You don’t get to rob them and screw them over like you’ve been doing for decades.” 
Smith continues by saying that because of this lack of care and leadership from the NCAA and universities, he expects student-athlete unions to come to prominence. These unions, like those that have come before them, are advocating for better workplace conditions and compensation from the institution exploiting their labor. 
College athletes’ voices will be heard by not only the NCAA but now lawmakers, as California became the first state to pass legislation protecting them. The Fair Pay to Play Act, which passed unanimously in the California State Senate and Assembly last year, allows for student-athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness starting in 2023.
Dismantling the rent-seeking nature of the NCAA has gained bipartisan support in an increasingly divided political climate. It appears now that this will be the norm in coming years as 16 other states have introduced similar legislation to empower student-athletes in achieving what they rightly deserve.
By no means do I dislike being a student-athlete. College athletes have incredible resources to support us, which I am very much grateful for. However, when administrators are earning generous salaries from athletes who would lose eligibility over accepting a dollar for an autograph, I can’t say this is acceptable to anyone. 
History has seen that those in power will exploit workers if there are no protections given to them. The United States can expect this exploitative behavior from the NCAA to continue until it takes the work of student-athletes more seriously. At the end of the day, the everyday rec-league player and an elite college athlete should not both have to say they are “amateurs” in their sport.

Christopher Nolan is no stranger to making his audiences think, rather than feel. His new film “Tenet” is no exception to that philosophy. An exploration into the physics of time, the story itself requires an unavoidable suspension of disbelief. “Tenet” is full of dichotomies, making you feel conflicted by the end, yet still amazed by what Christopher Nolan has made. 
The movie follows an unnamed spy known simply as The Protagonist (John David Washington). He’s an international operative who uses time-traveling technology called inversion to prevent World War III. Washington’s character arms himself only with a palindrome word, Tenet, to complete a mission that extends beyond real time.
The film itself also stretches past the casual running time for movies nowadays. Clocking in at a brisk 150 minutes, “Tenet” doesn’t just give a lot to its audience — it asks a lot as well. The movie is always one step ahead of its viewers, never allowing much time to breathe; that’s why it feels surprising when, suddenly, it’s all over. 
“Don’t try to understand it. Feel it,” describes one of the characters, Barbara (Clémence Poésy), when explaining the science behind inversion to The Protagonist. At the same time, her dialogue expresses what Nolan wants from fans. If audiences cast away their overanalysis, then “Tenet” proves to be an enjoyable experience; if people instead speculate over the convoluted nature of the film’s plot and structure, then perhaps these viewers will find themselves tired, even frustrated by the film. Such is the case with the endings of many Nolan films back to Memento, but somehow “Tenet” takes the interpretive, deep finale to a whole new level. 
Part of what makes “Tenet” confusing is the controversial sound design. Nolan has continued a trend from his previous films such as “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk” of mixing character dialogue well below music and sound effects, meaning that crucial information such as story context is sometimes inaudible. 
However, this is just one of the many aspects of the film that serves two distinct purposes, as individual pieces of dialogue are meant to be cryptic and slightly indiscernible. Dualities like this will have a polarizing effect among audiences, but that’s partly what makes “Tenet” so bold. With complete creative control, Nolan made this film entirely on his own terms. “Tenet” is no easy introduction into Nolan’s style, and it’s not super accessible for the casual moviegoer, but because the film is so dense, it’s highly rewatchable, as every consecutive viewing may provide more information and a greater understanding. 
On the topic of duplicities, “Tenet” finds Nolan working with some familiar faces, while simultaneously branching out to new collaborators. For instance, Nolan reunites with Hoyte Van Hoytema, who previously served as the cinematographer on “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk.” Therefore, the film looks flawless, including all its technical achievements of capturing certain characters and objects moving forward in time while others simultaneously run in reverse. Furthermore, his wife Emma Thomas, who has co-produced many of his films, continued as a producer for “Tenet.” 
As for new partnerships, “Tenet” marks Nolan’s departure from his usual composer Hans Zimmer, as the German musician had signed onto Denis Villenueve’s upcoming film “Dune.” Thus, Nolan hired USC alumnus Ludwig Göransson, who has collaborated most frequently with fellow alumnus Ryan Coogler on films such as “Black Panther.” While the score may lack the signature motifs of Zimmer’s work, Göransson brings his own refreshing sound with an abrasive and hypnotically rhythmic score. Göransson even teamed up with rapper Travis Scott, who released a single for the film called “The Plan” leading up to the big release. The music certainly helps uplift the picture’s momentum.
Additionally, Nolan worked for the first time with Jennifer Lame, who is best known for her work as an editor on “Manchester by the Sea,” “Marriage Story” and “Hereditary.” At times the editing feels jumpy, almost jarring, but, for the most part, her editing effectively allows characters to travel beyond the traditional temporal design parameters. 
“Tenet” is a bombastic movie, especially in terms of concept, ambition and worldbuilding. It almost feels like a two and a half hour trailer for another ten-hour movie; however, that’s one of the more intriguing parts about it, as every individual scene felt like a portal into another story, another universe. Trying to unravel the mystery of “Tenet” is part of the adventure. 
As expected with Nolan films over the past decade, “Tenet” plays with time through a combination of gargantuan action sequences and witty expository dialogue. However, certain set pieces outshine others, and only time will tell which special effects moments will live up to the hype of other cinematic moments in Nolan’s filmography.  
Maybe the glue that keeps all of Nolan’s moving parts together is the actors and their respective performances. John David Washington’s chemistry with Neil (Robert Pattinson) rivals the on-screen friendship of Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon Levitt from “Inception.” The character, Kat (Elizabeth Debicki), also brought the most tension on-screen with the antagonist, Andrei Sator (Kenneth Branagh). Despite many new collaborators, Nolan delivers a familiar tone. The audience is not supposed to feel for the characters but rather the world that the characters embellish. 
A major blockbuster hopeful to bring people back to the theaters, “Tenet” is only worth seeing if it can be done so safely. The movie is out wherever theaters have reopened, and no streaming services will have it for the foreseeable future.

Two days before the release of his new single “BS,” Sven Gamsky, the namesake behind Still Woozy, joined the °1824 team of Universal Music Group for a virtual press conference.  
Attendees were able to get an exclusive early listen to the highly anticipated song. Followed by a Q&A, the Bay Area native shared his creative process and memorable experiences.
Previous 2017 singles such as “Goodie Bag” and “Cooks” introduced the world to the gooey sounds and textured production signature to Gamsky’s work. Recently signed to Interscope Records, the artist is now working on new music during quarantine. 
The new single “BS” is filled with echoey vocals, catchy drum tracks and heavy-bass loops. The attention to production is expected with Gamsky’s detail-oriented track record.
Yet, the 28-year-old artist makes it clear that this upcoming release is not an all-encompassing glimpse into a new direction for his sound. The focus, for now, he shares, is to produce music that interests him. 
Regarding his creative process, Gamsky said, “I just love, like, playing with sounds and textures. And it’s just so much fun to make beats, and just like create something out of nothing.” 
Though on a major label, Gamsky continues to opt for self-producing his tracks. 
“The beautiful part of self-producing is that you’re just curating all these sounds for people, and maybe, that’s why it feels more like a unified whole is because they’re all, this is like my particular lens, my taste,” Gamsky said.
Gamsky wants to let listeners know that there is no ultimate method to consume his music, but he said he does mix with headphones in mind.
“I’m mixing these tiny little noises that are like that, you know, like for a second in like the right ear or something,” Gamsky said. “And then if you’re on headphones … you’ll be able to hear that more.”
During the press conference Wednesday, Gamsky spoke about being “genre-less” and what that encapsulates for him. Having space to explore and express the multiple different parts of himself are essential for the artist.
“I could never really describe my own music ’cause I feel like I have so many different influences,” Gamsky said. 
After years of songwriting, Gamsky’s has gone on to fully develop his dream-like melodies. With the recent single, “Windows,” he samples Marvin Gaye’s vocals. Gamsky’s influences continue to form inventive and playful tracks.
“I have too many ideas to be stuck in one place,” Gamsky said, “and I don’t want people to get used to one thing either you know.”
As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, Still Woozy’s tours have been canceled for the time being. 
Missing live performances, Gamsky shared his perspective on the most memorable performance that took place last fall at The Fonda Theatre. During this leg of the tour, USC alumna Remi Wolf was brought on tour. 
Reminiscing on his crowd surfing on a rubber ducky inflatable, Gamsky said, “It was just such good energy and just like I don’t know, I love kind of rambunctious like shit like that … It’s like the crazier the crowd gets the crazier I get.”
Rather than being put on a pedestal, Gamsky wants to interact directly with the crowd. Being able to have live feedback helps keep the energy up, he said. 
Speaking to the concept of an album, Gamsky alluded to Dominic Fike’s debut studio album “What Could Possibly Go Wrong” as a point of excitement. The multi-instrumental artist said Fike’s project reassured his ideas of incorporating different styles under one project.
With a history of producing in his garage, Gamsky’s success in the music industry is a result of a strong work ethic. As the conference winded down, the indie artist had words of advice for upcoming artists. 
“Focus less on getting bigger, getting famous or whatever and focus more on the music,” Gamsky said. 
Rather than rapidly breaking into the industry, Gamsky urged individuals to take the time to build their work to the same level as other music currently out.
The uninhibited nature of Gamsky’s songwriting continues to outdo genre limitations. In a time of uncertainty, the promise to not settle on a distinct sound is comforting for Still Woozy fans.
The single “BS” is out Thursday released under exclusive license to Interscope Records.

It’s the second installment of my column and time to jump right into the controversial stuff. It’s time to broach a highly debated, heavily memed subject: veganism.
Full disclaimer — I am not and have never been vegan. Throughout college, I’ve gone through phases of experimental vegetarianism, but even when my lactose-intolerant brain screams “no,” I see no reason to turn down a good grilled cheese or a slice of pizza.
While my admittedly short, albeit dedicated vegetarian experience is over (for now), my eating habits have definitely changed. I find myself naturally gravitating toward more plant-based foods instead of meat-heavy meals. A few years ago, I would never have believed that a veggie California burrito just hits different than the classic carne asada (pro tip –– it absolutely does).
While vegetarianism and veganism are growing in popularity, being a conscientious grocery consumer is a privilege, not a right. While society is more accommodating of dietary restrictions than ever, it can still be costly to maintain a balanced and nutritious vegan diet. Many advocates of veganism claim that staples such as pasta, rice, tofu, beans and lentils are cheaper than their animal-product counterparts. You’ll undoubtedly save money not buying meat –– it’s estimated that one fillet of chicken breast is $5 per pound and has about 24 grams of protein per serving, but a can of black beans typically costs around a dollar for the same amount of protein.
The math is simple –– per year, plant-based consumers can save a significant amount of money. However, vegan diets do require dedication. Buying more fresh produce is great for your body, but comparatively, it goes bad much faster than frozen foods or pantry sundries, meaning more quick trips to the grocery store are needed to restock. Many vegans also develop nutritional deficiencies because they commonly lack vitamin B12 and vitamin D3, nutrients that are found almost exclusively in animal-sourced foods and are crucial for nerve and brain function. 
While being vegan can be affordable, this doesn’t offset the fact that some degree of budgetary flexibility is needed to successfully maintain a plant-based diet. It is achievable, but not for all. Kids who are part of school-free and reduced-lunch programs don’t have the luxury of rejecting what is put on their plate. In food deserts like South Central, it can be more difficult (although not impossible) to access a consistent assortment of fresh produce. 
Getting the most food for your dollar means that many aren’t necessarily focused on the nutritional quality of what they’re purchasing –– they’re just trying to make sure their family doesn’t go hungry. Processed foods often have a longer shelf life and are more readily available than fresh fruits, vegetables and pricey vegan-certified and meat-substitute products. 
For those that qualify for the United States Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, it can be extremely hard to align the goals of both healthy and affordable eating. The federal program, often referred to as SNAP, is essentially a food-stamp benefit program designed to “supplement the food budget of needy families so they can purchase healthy food.” 
While its goal is admirable, it’s also extremely vague. There is an educational component of the program that teaches SNAP beneficiaries about the best methods of buying cheap, nutritious foods and leading healthy lives. However, the number of stores that accept SNAP is limited, and beneficiaries are more focused on their primary goal of alleviating hunger than choosing the most nutritious options. Additionally, the maximum monthly SNAP allotment for a family of four is $649, coming out to $36 a person per week, leaving little room for error or experimentation when shopping for the bare essentials.  
Many ways to improve the program and enhance its nutritional impact have been suggested, including increasing the number of places that accept SNAP benefits, expanding to more farmers markets and offering cash incentives to purchase and further subsidize the cost of fresh produce. To fully commit to and execute their goal of achieving healthy lifestyles for all, the process of food accessibility as a whole needs to change.
No one sells the vegan lifestyle like a newly converted vegan. There’s no shortage of celebrities, professional athletes and influencers who are strong proponents of a plant-based diet. Colorful photos of carefully prepared fruits, veggies and grains flood Instagram health accounts, reinforcing the message that veganism is healthy, easy and enjoyable. While these fit, glowing and healthy individuals make veganism look fun and simple, it’s important to consider the divide between Instagram and reality.
Even for the everyday herbivore, dedication, time and research are needed to ensure you are getting all of the supplements and nutrients needed for a healthy diet. A few years ago, LeBron James made headlines for following an extremely strict paleo diet –– cutting out sugar, carbs and dairy entirely and subsisting solely on meat, fish, fruits and vegetables –– and losing a drastic amount of weight. 
The reason LeBron was so successful? He had resources that the average health-conscious consumer does not — private trainers, nutritionists and chefs to provide him with the knowledge and nutrients needed to conduct a drastic diet change and still maintain his superhuman fitness and athleticism. In most instances, it can be extremely unhealthy and unsafe to cut entire food groups out of your diet. Those with underlying health issues, allergies and dietary restrictions and those recovering from eating disorders may not necessarily benefit from a restrictive diet like veganism. 
All this is not to say that being vegan can’t be a healthy, family-friendly diet, but there are several crucial caveats to consider when contemplating a switch to veganism. Having the ability to make choices about what you eat is a privilege in itself. Veganism can be an affordable, eco-friendly and ethical switch –– if you have the resources to do so.
