USC Athletic Director Mike Bohn released a statement Wednesday announcing that the University will not allow on-campus tailgating before the Trojans’ home opener against San Jose State on Sept. 4th. 
In accordance with a public order issued by the Los Angeles County Department of Health last week, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will require both vaccinated and unvaccinated fans to wear masks or face coverings when inside the stadium. The policy applies to venues that host crowds exceeding 10,000 people, a mark the Trojans will exceed with a full-capacity Coliseum. According to the policy, the only time these masks or face coverings can be taken off is for a short period when consuming food or drinks. 
The announcement came midway through the first week of the fall semester at USC when students, faculty and other staff members were welcomed back to campus after more than a year away. 
USC has assessed the coronavirus situation within its population so far on campus with protocols such as Trojan Check. Fans that plan to walk through campus to access the Coliseum will be required to complete a Trojan Check before entering. 
Even as the university has cancelled on-campus gameday events, the Coliseum’s pre-game activities are set to go as originally planned. The stadium is also still set to host a full-capacity crowd.
These alterations currently only pertain to the first game of the season, and changes to the logistics of upcoming USC athletic events will be made with consultation from public health officials.

Women’s volleyball is set to host its annual Trojan Invitational at Galen Center this weekend. This year’s tournament will feature four teams: USC, University of Denver, Campbell University and Cal State University, Northridge. 
Head coach Brad Keller knows better than anybody how important it will be to improve upon last year’s weaknesses.
“I think that we are going to improve in the ball control category from last year,” Keller said. “I’m hoping that we’re going to be a really good, tough, serving team. We have seven new players. We have a lot more depth. We have a lot of players that are healthy.”
Denver will be the Trojans’ first out-of-conference opponent since Dec. 7, 2019, when USC lost to Baylor in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. The Pioneers finished the 2020-21 season with a 14-3 record, with their only losses coming to Omaha and South Dakota and they won five of their last six games. Fifth year senior Tina Boe will continue to lead a Denver team that won five of its last six games to close out last season. During the 2020 campaign, Boe averaged 1.27 blocks per set, ranking second in the Summit League Conference. 
Following the invitational’s opener against Denver, the second opponent USC will face is Campbell University. The Fighting Camels had a solid 2020 campaign, finishing the season with an 11-5 overall record. Campbell’s first matchup of the season took place Aug. 21 against Liberty, where they won 3-1. 
Graduate senior outside hitter Brooke Botkin is hoping her four seasons of experience will help the team understand the importance of early-season momentum. 
“It’s super important that we continue to win right off the bat so that we can finish strong at the end of [the] season,” Botkin said.
CSUN is the final opponent for USC this weekend. The game will cap off the Trojan Invitational and will feature a volleyball appreciation night for fans. Unlike the Trojans, however, CSUN’s 2020 volleyball season was completely cancelled due to the coronavirus. The Matadors haven’t played an official game since Nov. 21, 2019, a game which capped off a 12-16 season. Senior outside hitter Sevion Waggoner will continue to lead CSUN after posting a team high 335 kills in 2019. Before transferring to CSUN, Waggoner spent her freshman year playing for Rice University.
USC’s first game against Denver will tip off the three-day Trojan Invitational at 7:30 p.m. on Aug. 27 at the Galen Center.

Women’s soccer is looking to rebound on the road against BYU Thursday after a season-opening loss to Pepperdine Aug. 19. The 2-0 defeat saw the Trojans, who were ranked No. 14 nationally prior to the game, fall to the No. 25 spot in the latest rankings.
Unlike last season’s schedule, which featured almost exclusively Pac-12 opponents, USC is set to face many competitive non-conference opponents this fall, such as No. 18 Michigan and No. 24 BYU. The Trojan’s first stop is in Provo, Utah against the Cougars. 
“We’ve seen [BYU] last year, and they return pretty much the same squad,” said head coach Keidane McAlpine. “I think with the quality of the competition that we’re going to play and having to play on the road in some adversity, at altitude, different things like that, is just going to make us stronger and prepare us for our conference. ” 
BYU’s season began with a dominant 3-0 win over Ohio State. Senior midfielder Mikayla Colohan scored twice, and freshman midfielder Olivia Smith assisted all three of the team’s goals. The Cougars are coming off of a 2-1 loss to No. 14 Auburn, making the journey back from Alabama to face a strong USC team. 
While USC’s attack kept Pepperdine’s goalie busy with nine shots on goal in last week’s loss, they struggled to contain the Waves’ attack, committing 11 fouls over the course of the game. 
Pepperdine struck late in the first half, with redshirt senior forward Devyn Gifoy scoring off of a botched clearance attempt by the USC defense. Gifoy assisted on the second half goal by junior midfielder Carlee Giammona. 
“We played well enough and did enough to win,” McAlpine said. “We’ll improve defensively, just with some defensive transition things we’ve been working on.”
After dropping their first home game of the season, the Trojans will go on the road for their next five games. Last year, USC struggled on the road, going 1-3-2. Their only away win came late in the season, defeating Cal 5-0. 
Despite losing to Pepperdine for the first time since 2014, USC has plenty of reason to feel confident going into its game against BYU. With the return of senior forward Penelope Hocking and junior midfielder Croix Bethune, there is plenty of veteran leadership on this season’s team. 
Hocking has accumulated numerous All Pac-12 first team selections in her time as a Trojan, scoring 42 goals in her 58 games at USC. While the Trojan offense will suffer with the departure of forward Tara McKeown — who was drafted by the Washington Spirit in the NWSL — Hocking will look to fill that gap. 
Bethune has waited for a full season of soccer since her senior year of high school, as she missed the 2019 season with a torn ACL and played a shortened season this past year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Last season, Bethune was a key component of the USC midfield and a valuable attacking asset, as seen in her three-goal, one assist performance against Cal. 
“I think she’s a big talent that can create for us, get us out of situations, be a playmaker, and so we’re looking for more of that out of her,” McAlpine said. 
The match-up between the Cougars and Trojans last season featured dynamic attacking displays by both squads, resulting in a 4-3 USC win. However, last year’s game was played in the Coliseum, where the Trojans finished with an undefeated 6-0-1 home record. This year, the Cougars play host to a USC team that has struggled on the road in its recent history, failing to win all but one away game last season.
This year’s matchup will kick off Thursday night at 7 p.m. A livestream of the game will be available on BYUtv.

As the sun went down and lights turned on, a crowd of new and returning students waited in line outside McCarthy Quad. Food trucks drew people in with promising smells of good foods and a bridge of blue and green lights became the center of attention for students wanting to document their time in photos. As the DJ’s music blasted across McCarthy Quad, the night began. But the hype of the crowd did not last as the night went on.
After more than a year in lockdown, welcome week was jam-packed with events every night including an in-person karaoke night, prom event and movie night. The week finally came to an end with the Welcome Back Concert put on by the USC Concerts Committee Saturday. With the doors opening at 6:30 p.m. just outside Leavey Library, the line extended past alumni park with a significantly large crowd at the event.
Leading up to the event,  the Concerts Committee released the lineup, leaving the reveal of the headliner AG Club until the day before the event. Alternative artist, Jelani Aryeh opened the night at 8 p.m. with his well-known song “Marigold.”  
Around 8:45 p.m., the crowd made its way across the lawn to the stage, dancing and waiting for Audrey Nuna to take the stage. Colorful lights matched Nuna’s set that included soulful, R&B, alternative and rap components, creating an overall exciting performance as people in the crowd swayed back and forth with her music. 
The crowd momentarily dispersed before the anticipated headlining R&B group AG Club went on at 10 p.m. 
With an almost hour-long set, AG Club struggled to keep students entertained. The crowd began to dwindle after just a few songs and by 10:40 p.m. it was about half as big as when the event started.
In spite of AG Club’s upbeat songs, their onstage charisma and the hype leading up to the night, it was hard to ignore how the reception of both Audrey Nuna and AG Club affected the overall success of the night.  
Audrey Nuna’s sound, reminiscent of Billie Eilish and Lorde, may have been a miss for some, but her lyricism and energy were great to vibe to. After being hyped up by the DJ’s selection of Kanye West and Olivia Rodrigo songs, the anticipation of the headliners, AG Club, could be felt all around. The anticipation unfortunately was not long-lived. In between songs, the artists began to mention how their previous crowds have outdone USC’s energy. By the end of the night, the boys of AG Club switched their tone, instead joking about the energy of the crowd being “the best,” even though that was a far cry from reality. 
Although the crowd walked away with possible new favorite artists, like Audrey Nuna, the overall night did not go as expected or live up to the hype leading up to the event. The Concerts Committee has done a great job of finding artists, promoting events and even finding sponsors like PopPay for food trucks and vendors for the event; yet, there is still room to grow in regards to finding artists that will keep the crowd engaged and match the crowds’ energy.

Correction: This article was updated to reflect Jelani Aryeh’s pronouns as he/him, correct the spelling of his name and correct the day the headliner was announced. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

Like many of us Anna Fujii downloaded Instagram in middle school. However, her account would soon surpass a typical triple digit following. Also, like many of us, she downloaded TikTok last year. But again, few have been able to make their mark on the social media world like Fujii has, most recently, on TikTok.
Several months before the coronavirus would close schools, send countries into lockdowns and bring millions to the social media app, USC seniors Brianna Seaberg and Anna Fujii joined TikTok. In January 2020, the two began creating videos on their personal accounts that would soon boast thousands of followers. 
As long-time members of USC’s social media organization “Reach” — a club that helps students connect to other influencers and brands — neither Seaberg nor Fujii were strangers to social media. Both creators held substantial followings on other platforms like Instagram, where Seaberg currently has 15,000 followers and Fujii has almost 40,000, but TikTok held unique opportunities for them with its short-form videos. On the app, Seaberg and Fujii boast over 18,000 and 695,000 followers respectively. 
Fellow Reach member and Tiktoker, Conrad Rocha, commented that Seaberg, like Fujii, was able to make a smooth transition into the newer app because of her familiarity with social media and preexisting work on other apps like Youtube.
“[Seaberg has] been doing social media since our freshman year, so I don’t think TikTok was [far] out of her range of ability; it’s right up her alley.” Rocha said, “She was making YouTube videos her freshman year, so like I think TikTok was just a really easy way to translate her already existing platform to another.”
The TikTok algorithm not only shuffles through trends but also allows newer creators and products to become popular. Both Seaberg and Fujii have taken advantage of this element of TikTok and have been able to partner with various brands to advertise their products in videos. 
“TikTok is great for promoting growth, letting people find new things and just spreading information about different products,” Fujii said. 
Seaberg began her career in TikTok when the app contacted her through USC Reach and asked her to become a brand ambassador for the University. Since then, her collaborative videos have not only promoted TikTok to USC students but also showcased other well-known brands. 
“Honestly, when I first downloaded TikTok, I don’t think I realized the effect it would have on my life,” Seaberg said. “It’s opened up so many opportunities for brand deals, partnerships. I’ve gotten to work with huge brands like Papa John’s, Kendra Scott, Amazon.” 
For both creators, what started as just another social media account turned into an opportunity to get professional work experience.
“I think every interview I’ve had for internships and jobs and freelance work, every single one asks me, ‘Tell us about your TikTok account,’” said Seaberg, who is majoring in communications. 
While Seaberg and Fujii acknowledged the skills they learned from TikTok, they also pointed out the ways their respective studies influenced how they use the app. 
Fujii, who is majoring in cinema and media studies, talked about how her formal schooling in media studies influences her videos. From implementing editing and cinematography techniques, to learning how to look at videos through the eyes of a film critic, Fujii has put lectures into practice. 
“I have become very analytical, so even when I try to watch things for fun, I can’t help critique it a little in my mind. So, it’s definitely helped me view myself as a creator,” Fujii said. 
But for these creators, TikTok isn’t just about establishing connections to the classroom, it’s about creating connections with other people. 
When Seaberg started making more videos during quarantine, she began to see questions in the comments asking how she filmed certain portions of her videos. Paying close attention to that feedback, she decided to share a video detailing the steps of her editing process. The tutorial video soon went viral, and since then, most of Seaberg’s TikToks have been teaching her followers editing techniques. Her comment section is full of not only questions for upcoming videos but also thanks from the followers she’s helped along the way. 
“So many people were like, ‘Thank you, I saw so many creators do this trend, but I didn’t know how to do it so I couldn’t do it’… I think that’s what really drew me to help others,” Seaberg said about the experience. 
On her lifestyle and fashion page, Fujii also builds relationships with her followers through what she posts and how she films it. Fujii’s comedy videos create a sense of familiarity between her and her viewers, as she talks to them like old friends and shares stories about her life. 
“Social media is all about vulnerability and authenticity so I think people like it when it’s less refined,” Fujii said. 
Rocha, a long-time friend of Fujii, attested that she is authentic with her followers, as she interacts with people on the app like she would in her normal life. 
“Obviously you can’t display your full self on social media, but I think [her in-person and online presence] lines up. If anything, Anna is even more funny and outgoing in person,” Rocha said. 
Seaberg and Fujii’s commitment to their craft has allowed them to break down the barriers between themselves and their viewers. Even though they post to thousands of followers everyday, they are able to turn that number from an audience into a community. 
“I like interaction. I love talking to people on the internet,” Fujii said. “It’s fun to make internet friends from different places and loyal followers I can recognize and converse with.”
As Seaberg puts it, “When you start getting conversations [going] you can really kind of build [a community].”

Now that we’ve made the return to campus, it’s time to bask in the California sun and enjoy everything the state has to offer. To get you in the mood, we’ve put together a playlist of songs to remind you of the Golden State. So relax, turn up the volume and embrace the Californian vibes. 
“Surfin’ USA” – The Beach Boys
We’re kicking off this playlist with a classic beach jam that’s sure to get you in the chill west coast mood. Filled with infectious guitars and smooth vocals, this song will have you tapping your feet in no time and might even inspire a quick trip to Santa Monica. 
“Hotel California” – The Eagles
Maintaining the calm vibes, The Eagles will take you on a journey to “Hotel California.” Although this song may not actually be about the state of California — it’s actually a metaphoric criticism of the corruption and greed in the music industry — the Eagles’ hit is still noteworthy because it transports listeners into the sunny disposition the state is known for and is a well-known rock classic. 
“Californication” – Red Hot Chili Peppers
On a playlist all about California, you’ve got to have a song from the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The band didn’t officially become the rock legends we know them as today until their first-ever gig in Long Beach, and from there, the band paid tribute to the west coast every chance they could get — to date, the Golden State is mentioned in about 47 of their songs. Another song not really about California per se, but it’s still one of the most iconic songs from the band. 
“California Love” – 2Pac ft. Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman
Another beloved song, this track is probably one of the most popular songs about California. As soon as the iconic and heavily auto-tuned “California Love” plays, listeners immediately know that 2Pac, Roger and Dr. Dre are going to take them on a hip-hop-filled journey through all of the reasons why someone should love this state.
“California” – Rich Brian, NIKI and Warren Hue
One of the newer tunes on the list, this enchanting song describes each of the three artists’ experiences living in the Golden State. The trio believes that California is a good place, but people’s perception of the state tends to be rather romanticized. “Money makin’, while we’re breakin’ / It’s amazin’, California” encapsulates the realities of living in California — and is something many of us can relate to. 
“Surf City” – Jan & Dean
Let’s go to the beach-each! This ‘60s surf song is a surefire mood booster with its swinging melody, rockin’ beat and catchy hook. During the 60s, Jan & Dean were the unofficial ambassadors of California culture, scoring 16 Top 40 hits and even collaborating with Brian Wilson from The Beach Boys. 
“California” – Phantom Planet
Many of us know what it’s like to miss the warmth and comfort of California. This track calls out to the state as if it’s a long-lost lover, encapsulating what it feels like to finally make the journey back to the incredible state. The feelings expressed mirror how many felt during the California Gold Rush when they migrated to this brand new land of opportunity. 
“California Dreamin’” – The Mamas & Papas
Of course, this playlist had to include this memorable track. Some may know it from the California Powerball commercials that ran a couple of years ago, and others may have heard it performed by a school choir. Either way, it’s likely that you’ve listened to this tune at least once in your life. The dreamy love ballad to California captured the hearts of listeners across the country as many began to dream about escaping the cold weather of the east and moving to the sunny west coast. At the time, the track defined psychedelic pop and even created a brand new sub-genre of music. After its release, many alternate versions were recorded by artists like The Beach Boys, America and José Feliciano.
“Back to California” – Carole King
1971 was Carole King’s year as she topped the charts with not just one, but two No. 1 albums. “Back To California” was part of the tracklist on her second album, “Music,” the songwriter’s second most popular album of her career. In this song, King sings about longing to return back to her hometown in California where she belongs. It’s an upbeat tune with drums that interestingly imitate the sound of a train traveling back to the West Coast. 
“California Gurls” – Katy Perry ft. Snoop Dog
Did you think that we’d make a California playlist and forget about this famous bop? Back in 2010, pop icon Katy Perry gifted us with a new California anthem that rocketed up to the top of the charts. Similar to the surf songs of the ‘60s, this track made listeners long for the thrills and beaches of California.

The day Afghanistan’s government fell to the Taliban, Nadira Noor was supposed to be on a plane to Kabul to celebrate her sister’s wedding. 
“We woke up and heard the news, and I got an email from the airline saying that all the flights were cancelled,” said Noor, a senior majoring in applied data science and business administration.
The same week, the Taliban surrounded the exits in her sister’s apartment complex, and the people living in the building haven’t been able to leave since, Noor said. In contact with family members in the province of Kandahar — who have described dire conditions on the ground — Noor said they are experiencing food shortages and increased risk of coronavirus exposure. 
“There have been dead bodies on the street for a week,” Noor said. “People are too scared to go outside to pick up their loved ones and have funerals for their loved ones who are still laying on the street.” 
On Aug. 15, the Taliban seized Afghanistan’s capital city of Kabul and President Ashraf Ghani fled the country. The collapse occurred weeks before President Joe Biden’s scheduled date for United States forces to withdraw from the country, marking a violent end to America’s longest war. Since Aug. 14, the United States evacuated nearly 80,000 people from the country, but there are still thousands of other Afghans fighting to escape. On Tuesday, the Taliban announced they’re no longer allowing Afghan nationals going to the Kabul airport to leave the country, creating even more panic among citizens attempting to leave. 
In interviews with the Daily Trojan, members of the USC Afghan Student Association shared that they were particularly concerned about what the government’s fall would mean for ethno-religious minorities and internally displaced people in Afghanistan. 
Kawsar Nasir, a graduate student studying public health, said her family faces danger due to being Shia muslims. Her family wants to commemorate the holy month of Muharram — a holiday primarily observed by Shia Muslims — but they’re staying home, since, in the past, the Taliban has attacked and massacred Shia Muslims while they gathered to pray. According to the Guardian, in 2002, the United Nations discovered three mass graves filled with Taliban victims — many of whom were believed to be Hazara, a Persian-speaking ethnic minority group who are also primarily Shia Muslims. More recently, in 2018, Aljazeera reported that Taliban forces attacked primarily Hazara villages in Ghanzi, killing at least 63 civilians and displacing thousands of others. 
Sumaya Hussaini, another member of USC AfgSA, also reflected on the significance of the Taliban’s takeover during Muharram.
“It’s just really painful seeing that [Muharram is] overlapping during this time because I think it highlights who is most at risk,” said Hussaini, a senior majoring in political science and public diplomacy. “All Afghans are at risk right now, but I also think it’s important to recognize how women are uniquely at risk, how Hazaras or other Shia people are at risk.” 
Hussaini’s grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles in Afghanistan have told her that the Taliban have continued to knock on doors, confiscate belongings and count the number of women and children in each family. 
Since the Afghan government collapsed, Hussaini’s family has tried to go to the Hamid Karzai airport every day, but they’ve either been stopped by security officers or arrived to find all the flights canceled. 
“Right now, [my family’s] trying to evacuate, but the problem is a lot of them don’t have visas or passports, so it’s almost impossible,” Hussaini said. “I check in on them every day, they are OK. They’re just really scared … We just have to wait and see what happens.”
In Kansas, Hussaini’s parents recently took in families who successfully made it out of Afghanistan. Hussaini said she’s worried about those families and all of the other refugees arriving to the US., as she feels they are likely to face hardships in their new residence. 
“People think ‘Taliban’ and equate it with Islam,” Hussaini said. “We saw in America that, after 9/11 happened and the U.S. invaded Afghanistan, there was a big rise in Islamophobia and xenophobia. I’m worried now that the U.S. has pulled out and the Taliban [has] taken over that we’ll see a similar trend.” 
Dr. Azizullah Amir, an alumnus who runs the Moraa Educational Complex — a school for women and girls in Kabul — said the Taliban recently instructed all universities in the area to close. Before the Afghan government collapsed, dozens of girls and women attended Moraa’s preschool, primary school, secondary school and university. Of those students, at least 130 were mothers who would have otherwise been unable to receive an education. 
Amir said he’s “very much” afraid of being targeted by the Taliban because of his advocacy for Afghan women and hopes USC will help him contact the State Department for a Special Immigrant Visa to flee the country with his children as soon as possible. 
In an email to the Daily Trojan, Rossier School of Education Dean Pedro A. Noguera wrote, “We have been in touch with Dr. Amir and we are trying to do everything possible to assist him in his efforts to leave Afghanistan and secure employment in the U.S. I have nothing definitive to report other than we are trying to help.” 
In early August, the USC Afghan Student Association began working with the non-profit Mothers of Afghanistan to raise money for food and shelter for internally displaced families and widows in Kabul and Jalalabad. The association also plans to protest for increased Special Immigrant Visas for Afghan refugees Saturday at the U.S. Federal Building. 
“This is an American issue,” Hussaini said. “I think when people hear what’s going on in Afghanistan, they’re like, ‘That’s across the world, I don’t know anyone from there, I don’t even know what that country looks like, whatever,’ but America’s actions and foreign policy have directly contributed to the current state of those people.”
Moving forward, Hussaini and Nasir look to urge USC to raise awareness and support their fundraising efforts for Afghan people in need.
“We have approximately 600 refugees coming into [Los Angeles/Orange County]. That’s a lot,” said Nasir. “This is something that the State Department probably won’t be able to accommodate … So that’s where we come in.”
Correction: A previous version of this article included sensitive information that has since been removed. It also misstated Sumaya Hussaini’s name as Sumaya Nasmin. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

After a two and a half year medical leave following her diagnosis of a chronic illness while attending a university on the east coast, Catherine Ames’ first experience as a USC student took place from her laptop —  her travel limited to USC’s Student Health Center and trips to Dulce with her mom.
But for Ames, the remoteness prevailed by bringing more “good than bad.” Although the virtual setting of classes hindered connections with her peers and resulted in a disconnect to the University, it also allowed Ames to completely accommodate her needs as an immunocompromised student with a disability by turning her camera off, muting herself, laying down when she felt overtired, taking notes from a recorded lecture and having all her medications nearby — all of which helped her transition back into academic life. 
Ames, a junior majoring in law, history and culture, said that having a disability, being neurodiverse and/or chronically ill, packing medical supplies of medications and treatments can require a lot of planning and cause a lot of anxiety. However, with the University’s announcement in mid-February detailing their plans to transition to in-person learning for the 2021-22 school year, Ames was left with many unanswered questions including who would be responsible for enforcing mask mandates.
“Is it on me as a student to advocate for myself and speak up? … Who will step up for me? Will the professor be on my side?” Ames said. “Will people who are disabled, chronically ill or neurodiverse lose educational time because it’s unsafe for us to go to class? … Will we now have a gap compared to our able-bodied students?” 
Contracting the coronavirus four weeks after getting fully vaccinated, Ames said she understands the illness’ reality and hopes others on campus remember that activities have yet to return to normal. For Ames, that means taking precautions as if everyone is unvaccinated to put her health first and foremost.
“It’s really difficult for someone like me who’s immunocompromised and disabled and is managing their health every minute of every day to be able to walk into a classroom and feel safe that everyone is vaccinated and wearing a mask,” Ames said. 
Kimi Zamora, co-director of the Student Accessibility Assembly, said she is also concerned about the risk the coronavirus poses to students with disabilities if no hybrid option is set in place to allow them to attend classes remotely.
“[The Delta variant] poses a big risk because if a student with a disability gets infected — whether they have the vaccine or not — the severity of the effects will be a lot greater, and their life would be at risk,” said Zamora, a senior majoring in intelligence and cyber operations. “To the average student, you get sick, most likely you’re not going to be hospitalized, the risk is a lot less.”
Zamora also said SAA will hold their internal meetings remotely to protect their members, particularly as they could not ethically support students with disabilities to meet in a full capacity room during a pandemic. Access to live interpreters and closed captioning during their remote meetings made a big difference to many members, she said.
During the pandemic, the Office of Student Accessibility Services worked with students to ensure accessibility and support. In a statement to the Daily Trojan, OSAS said they scheduled meetings with students who asked for accommodations prior to returning to campus. 
“There were many lessons that we learned during the pandemic on helping better accommodate students at USC,” OSAS said in the statement. “As we know, students all have different accommodation needs, learning styles and being remote taught us new strategies to help students get what they needed. We are taking what we learned and applying it to in-person classes, helping students succeed at the university.”
Senior Sara Zuluaga Sierra, co-director of SAA, said, in addition to remote learning providing further health precautions, it also allowed her to watch recordings of classes and take notes when she had a flare up during the spring semester. According to Zuluaga Sierra, who majors in non-governmental organizations and social change, students with disabilities at USC and other universities have called for online options as an accommodation long before the pandemic transitioned the country’s school system online. Moving into increased in-person learning, online options are requests they continue to make.
“I understand that [USC] is like a business and needs to think of the financial repercussions for their actions,” Zuluaga Sierra said. “In this case, I’m talking about disabled people are risking at the benefit of other able bodied people getting to function ‘normally.’”

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed USC’s coronavirus plans during the first Senate meeting of the 2021-22 school year Tuesday. Members of the executive branch and Senate also presented updates on their first projects of the year, including a new language center and an initiative to support local small businesses. 
Senior Executive Aide and Chair of the COVID-19 and Return to Campus Taskforce Katelyn Lee discussed the efforts she and USG have implemented to keep students informed on the status of coronavirus case numbers on campus. Over the summer, Lee said she attended regular meetings with Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman and worked with the USG Communications Branch to create weekly coronavirus updates on Instagram. 
Moving into the fall semester, Lee’s priorities for the taskforce include promoting vaccination rates among students, especially international students due to their lack of access to vaccines. According to Lee, USG is also communicating with project specialists at Keck Medicine to work on future collaborations to promote vaccination to the surrounding South Central community. 
“Our outreach will look like finding ways we can use our funds and advocacy efforts to promote vaccination and safe practices in the external community. This is a priority for USG because the return of USC students to campus may lead to an increase in transmission of COVID-19 in the external community,” Lee said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We want to ensure that community members have access to vaccination and other resources to support them through the ongoing pandemic.” 
Lee also said she looks to increase coronavirus-related transparency from USC Student Health and continue to share resources to ensure students’ safety. 
“Dr. Van Orman has done a really great job of putting information out there, but [we’re] just helping to promote those efforts and, of course, sharing and creating resources as the situation continues with the Delta variant, making sure that our students are safe,” Lee said. 
At a student health media briefing on Aug. 19, Van Orman said that 92% of domestic undergraduate and graduate students, including those who are undocumented, are vaccinated. Eighty percent of international graduate students and 70% of international undergraduate students are vaccinated. Approximately 1.3% of students, staff and faculty are unvaccinated but are approved for a medical or religious exemption, and approximately 3.3% are unvaccinated without an exemption, rendering them incompliant with the University’s coronavirus policy. 
USG President Alexis Areias also announced the opening of a Center for Languages and Cultures, a space that will “target language learning on campus, creating a culture of language learning that is much larger than what we’re seeing currently.” 
“I personally love language … I think it’s a really important thing, and I think the fact that we have such an international population at USC; it’s important that we are valuing language and the additions that it can bring to our community,” Areias said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Sen. Arie Abija also presented her work with Trojan Shop Local, an initiative started by local students to promote local businesses in the South Central area. The initiative consists of a list of local businesses researched and approved by the students, which can be found on their website and their Instagram page. 
“I’m actually not from [Los Angeles] originally, so I feel like another transplant to this community, just like a lot of USC students are,” Abija said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Being able to just see that, ‘Hey, a local business owner feels seen by the University,’ and [Trojan Shop Local is] a tiny way I can do it; that’s why I was really interested in getting involved.” 
Abija also discussed the beginnings of another project to revamp the way South Central is portrayed towards prospective and new USC students on campus tours and at orientation. 
“I feel like the narrative about South Central being dangerous and the negative connotations start really early, and so, to get started at admissions and orientation, making that a positive connotation of the story would be great,” Abija said. 
As the in-person school year begins after a year and a half of virtual learning, Areias said she looks forward to showing the student body what’s “new and improved and fresh” with USG. 
“I think there’s a lot of moving parts, but at the end of the day, we’re just really excited to be back,” Areias said. “I think the next few weeks will be a real test to our University’s capacity … but I’m feeling optimistic.”

There is perhaps no state more neglected than West Virginia. The place John Denver once dubbed “almost heaven” in “Take Me Home, Country Roads” has a significant political history and is highly dependent on coal and mineral production. Now, after being lied to by former President Donald Trump who promised to bring back coal and soon-to-be neglected again by the current President’s party, West Virginia finds itself seemingly in the same old situation. 
However, recent data from the 2020 United States Census warns that West Virginia could face something worse than political neglect and stagnation as a population crisis looms on its rugged horizon. West Virginian leaders’ most recent attempt to solve the problem would not only be detrimental to folks already struggling to stay, but it could also exacerbate the mass exodus out of the Mountain State.
According to the most recent U.S. Census data, West Virginia has lost more residents than any other state. The population declined 3.3% over the past 10 years, which means that roughly 60,000 West Virginians have fled. Many have left through no fault of their own: Populations decreased in counties where coal mines have shuttered, despite the promises of political leaders from the state and federal level to revive the heart of coal country. 
Others have left because manufacturing jobs moved their operations overseas. As a consequence of its catastrophic population loss, the state will be losing a congressional seat, another kick in the head for a state already plagued by the specter of the opioid and HIV crises and exploitation by outside corporations. 
Political leaders in West Virginia are responding to the population dip with a program called Ascend WV, a collaboration between the state’s Department of Tourism, the state’s Department of Economic Development and West Virginia University. It is bankrolled by West Virginian and former Intuit CEO Brad D. Smith with a hefty $25 million donation. With that boost of funds, Ascend WV’s website promises $12,000 in cash to remote workers willing to relocate to the state, as well as a year of free outdoor activities and access to coworking spaces. Approximately 7,500 people have applied to take one of the 50 spots in the program.
Elected officials in West Virginia, slow to realize that the coal industry was already a foot in the grave years ago, are obviously in a pinch to diversify their economy — and fast. Their solution to woo remote workers to the state means attracting those in the tech industry. Remote workers bring in big money themselves: Payscale’s research on new salary data found that remote workers earn roughly 8.3% more than non-remote workers with the same experience doing the same job. 
On the surface, incentivizing high earners to come to the Mountain State to spend and bolster local economies sounds enticing for a state struggling to get itself on track. And yet, I just can’t help but think that these remote workers are harbingers of something worse: a second Silicon Valley.
Low and middle-income folks from Silicon Valley will surely understand what I’m talking about. To its credit, Silicon Valley has been an engine of creativity and innovation, driving the tech industry to new heights. Yet, so many folks who have lived in the region for decades are fleeing the area, if not the state, simply because they can’t afford to live there any longer as the prices of homes and the cost of living soar. It is a mass exodus spurred by the introduction of high-earning tech and remote workers, and it is my greatest fear that West Virginians will face the same fate as fleeing Californians if Ascend WV gains more traction. 
This fear isn’t rooted in some feverish prophecy that warns that everything the tech industry touches is ruined. It is more rooted in the fear that state leaders are courting non-West Virginians while doing absolutely nothing to address the concerns of those currently living in the state. 
Danielle Walker, a Democrat in the West Virginia House of Delegates, warns that the perks offered to remote workers by Ascend WV would essentially create a form of redlining in Morgantown, a city that she represents as well as one of the sites promoted by Ascend WV. Without offering a program that would offset the effects of redlining, West Virginia’s elected leaders cease to do their duty and serve their constituents. 
Proponents of Ascend WV usually deflect concerns like those from Danielle Walker, arguing that the program’s remote workers won’t be competing for local jobs because they’d be working online or at home. Proponents also say that these remote workers would also be supporting local businesses and economies. However, remote workers won’t need to compete for local jobs, especially since such jobs for blue-collar workers are already disappearing. 
And as optimistic as state legislators are about the altruism of the remote and tech industry, West Virginians deserve more than short-sighted transactional philanthropy. They deserve direct aid and support from the state and its elected officials. They deserve more investment in the education of their children, healthcare and infrastructure. If not, the current mass exodus out of the Mountain State will never end.

Content warning: This article mentions suicidal ideation. If you or anyone you know is struggling, please, contact your physician, go to your local ER, or call the suicide prevention hotline in your country. For the United States, the numbers are as follows:
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255), or message the Crisis Text Line at 741741. Both programs provide free, confidential support 24/7.
Today’s mental health movement often stresses the importance of supporting one’s friends and destigmatizing topics. However, society has not yet reached the level of understanding regarding other mental illnesses that go beyond being sad, stressed or anxious. Navigating more complex mental health conditions such as psychosis, suicidal ideation or panic disorders can be overwhelming for those involved, but the least helpful thing for a person experiencing emotional distress is to be abandoned as a hopeless cause — or worse — be labeled as dangerous, destructive or toxic. 
This begs the question: How should one deal with someone in a crisis?
Nowadays, people call each other toxic for almost every reason in the book, from a roommate who leaves their dishes in the sink for too long to an emotionally abusive partner. That’s the problem with the popularity of the word: Colloquially, it is extremely unspecific, and people use it frequently to describe individuals in their life whom they don’t like. It is a flimsy term. 
But what is society’s fascination with blanket-labeling someone as intrinsically “bad”? Believing that someone is bad, or “toxic,” suggests that this is just the way they naturally are and that they cannot or do not wish to change. Subconsciously, people may believe in fixed personality traits, which is untrue at best and harmful at worst. 
The problem with believing in fixed personality traits is that it snatches an opportunity to grow or change in any meaningful way. Research actually shows that even the most difficult personalities can change with work or treatment. Thus, believing in a fixed mindset easily allows us to avoid challenges and give up easily. So by presuming that a “toxic” person was born that way and will remain that way until they die, we are abandoning or “canceling” them because it is the easy thing to do. 
But what if we thought about why the person is acting this way?
Mental illness — no matter how mild or severe — is never a choice. Depression, anxiety and personality disorders are the result of biological, psychological or environmental factors. In other words, we cannot divide resulting behaviors into “good” or “bad.” Mental health can be debilitating, which can cause one to act out emotionally. This doesn’t make anyone evil or even mean that they had any malicious intent. Someone making an unskilled choice probably hasn’t learned the proper tools to navigate certain difficult situations. This is where skill-based therapy can be very helpful. 
Most everyday people don’t actually know how to deal with an emotional crisis. After all, there are trained professionals who have attended school for years to learn how to act in a crisis situation. But sometimes, people just need a friend to talk to — it may be much less daunting than calling a suicide hotline. However, most people don’t know how to respond to depressive or suicidal thoughts — chances are, they don’t even want to hear it. 
This is what therapists and other mental health professionals are for. Friends and family may become too distressed or disturbed seeing a loved one in crisis, but it is their duty to support that person to their fullest capability by making sure they are not alone or in danger and helping that person reach out for professional help if necessary. 
Friends, siblings or significant others can be difficult to get along with. After all, college students experiencing significant psychological problems is a growing concern on college campuses. Considering the past year and a half of living with the coronavirus, even young adults with no predisposition to mental illness have had a tough time. The pandemic has added a great amount of stress to students’ lives. We are concerned about our physical health and the health of our loved ones, all while grappling with the constant uncertainty that comes with living through a global pandemic.
With that being said, compassion and patience toward friends and peers needs to be shown now more than ever before. Whether they are moody, irritable, overbearingly anxious or even straight-up unpleasant, there is a chance that they are struggling with their own mental health. 
Before giving up on them by labeling them as a toxic person, we must try to understand what they are going through. We have the ability to empathize with others and need to learn to see both perspectives and tolerate different personalities, even in extreme situations. 
It may be satisfying to call someone toxic and cut them off, but that easily villainizes that person. In reality, someone struggling with mental illness is likely not a villain to anyone but themselves. But by using the term “toxic,” we blame the other person for these circumstances; for all we know, they are holding on the best they can. 
Instead of seeing the world in terms of good and bad, we could open a whole different viewpoint to see everyone trying their best in a difficult, emotional and exhilarating game of life.
