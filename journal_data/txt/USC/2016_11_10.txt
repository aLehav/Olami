In the aftermath of a historic election, the debate about how much power the federal government should be given, particularly in terms of education, will always be present in the United States. With a communist political system, Cuba’s government maintains complete authority and control over social and political issues. While the United States would never transition to such an authoritarian system of government, and I’m not suggesting this as such, it could learn from Cuba’s educational system. Specifically, Cuba’s high accountability standards, continual professional development for teachers, high access rates for all genders and races, among others, could be replicated if the United States wanted to have a high quality education system.
At the World Conference on Education for All in 1990, scholars gathered to develop consensus on what factors should be associated with a high-quality and highly effective educational system. These factors range from the institutional organization of a country’s educational system, such as supportive policies and sufficient funding and material resources, to school-based factors like clear goals and highly effective teachers. The Cuban government independently included several of these factors when creating their educational system, which helps account for their high achieving students.
Multiple studies have illustrated the high correlation between a pupil’s test scores and his or her socioeconomic background. Cuba breaks out of that mold as one of the countries in which, despite students’ relatively low social standing, students generally perform very well and have higher test scores than their low income would predict. Moreover, Cuban students outperform those in other Latin American countries with similarly low levels of wealth and receive the same high quality education that only wealthy, upper-class students would receive in other Latin American countries. So what is so unique about the Cuban education system that creates such high-achieving students? The communist system of government that encourages high-quality teaching with well-defined goals to ensure that  schools focus on student performance. 
One of the biggest takeaways from studying the Cuban education system is the positive impact that low income inequality can have on a country’s system of education. While poverty does exist in Cuba, even the very poor have access to food, shelter, healthcare and education. Additionally, by enforcing child labor laws, providing free healthcare to all and guaranteeing adult employment, Cuba works to ensure that low-income students are able to attend schools and do not have to work or go hungry. While a communist government affords few individual liberties, through large governmental oversight, the Cuban government assures that low-income students are given the same educational opportunities as higher income students. 
Additionally, Cuba’s system of measuring teacher performance helps assure that teachers continue to improve their craft with a reliable feedback and monitoring system. The United States largely keeps teachers accountable through monitoring student test scores, which results in educators focusing on teaching students content to pass exams more than developing critical thinking skills. In contrast, teachers in Cuba are presented with a portfolio of lessons and a video example of another teacher giving a lesson. This not only allows for greater collaboration among teachers, which would help all of the teachers improve, but would provide feedback for teachers with low pedagogical skill. 
Cuba is able to ensure such a high quality educational system because it requires families and teachers to conform to state-sponsored standards for students’ learning and has the unique governmental structure in place to guarantee conformity and control. One of the ways to achieve such collective interests, in which everyone is concerned with granting all students a high quality education, is that the state has to be much more of a guarantor of quality education for all. In other words, much like Cuba, the United States needs to take public responsibility for the success of its students. By tackling debilitating issues like poverty and income inequality, which both negatively impact a child’s educational attainment, and setting high standards for teachers through developing effective performance measures, the United States can move toward guaranteeing all students a high quality education.

Is Cuba’s fantastic educational system what helps make Cuba the wonderful place to live in? The reason no one who had a choice between the US or Cuba, would pick Cuba to live in is because it is a failed social experiment in what happens when there is too much government. The author speaks highly of Cuba because according to her, even the poor ave access to healthcare and food. So can she honestly tell me she would prefer to live in Cuba than the US? This is such BS. Put your money where your money is and make the decision to live elsewhere than the US – until then, stop being so sanctimonious.
Banish the teachers’ unions and make the rank and file compete for raises and promotions.  Competition generates excellence.  Tenure breeds complacency.   The mechanism to fire bad teachers must be condensed into a very brief probationary period.  As it stands today, the teachers’ unions are where the vocational cowards dwell.  And the out and out fact that anyone – and I mean anyone – can become a public school teacher, doesn’t pass the giggle test.
The problem with the education system in the US is that since the late 1960s to early 1970s the liberal element of I ur political system has hijacked our education system. They have hurt our kids over the years, and our ability to compete by dumbing down the curriculum.  Participation trophies, pass fail grading systems, all contribute to a lazy work ethic.  It will be the generation of your parents and yours that can bring this country back up the ladder of success, as it was 50+ years ago.  
The federal government is too big to be successfulm I n the manner it was back in the glory days of America. Thank you Obama.  We must reduce the size of governemnt  and allow the states to educate their citizens, determine their general rules of law, much as what our country was intended, not to be ruled by the east coast elite.

By now, the fact that Donald Trump will be the next President of the United States has settled in. Protests, pleas and arguments will undoubtedly continue, but barring an unanticipated obstruction, we will all have to accept a Trump administration. If nothing else, we can say with credit that American democracy has worked; the Electoral College has been apportioned, and all that is left to do is wait until Inauguration Day.
So let’s talk about what that could mean. Trump made many conflicting promises during his candidacy. Regardless of which ones he chooses to keep, catastrophic consequences may result all the same.
In terms of foreign policy, Trump has promised to operate with an “America first” perspective. That infers an end to what many have referred to as regime-change policies, a foreign policy outlook with the goal of inspiring democratic values abroad, especially in the Middle East. Trump has attacked this perspective as inefficient and counterintuitive, and has consistently pointed to the governments in Iraq and Afghanistan as costly failed experiments. He seems to want to restrict American presence abroad, especially in Europe, much to the chagrin of America’s allies and NATO partner states.
In addition to Trump’s apparent desire to decrease America’s participation in protecting NATO allies and democracies abroad, it is no secret that Trump seeks warmer relations with Russia. While some hold that this is preferable to confrontation, especially in Syria, the international implications of such a choice could be dramatic. An America unwilling to support NATO allies could result in credible fear in countries that used to make up the communist Eastern Bloc. With Russian involvement in Ukraine continuing into the present, Russian cyberattacks on neighboring states and Poland’s membership in NATO, the United States will have a plethora of international squabbles that it will need to balance carefully if it wants to remain in the good graces of both Russia and Europe, an objective that may become impossible to attain in coming years.
At the same time that Trump has decried the heretofore predominantly American role in defending U.S.-aligned countries, he has promised to get tough on international terrorism, a promise that most likely requires the extraterritorial use of force to fulfill. Of course, making greater international use of American forces seems quite at odds with his other stated goals. During Barack Obama’s presidency, American presence in the Middle East declined, but drone strikes and surgical strikes by U.S. special forces have been used to target high-priority individuals such as Osama bin Laden. How Trump hopes to more effectively tackle international terrorism without staging international interventions is unclear.
Trump’s attitude toward China and apparent beliefs about East Asia are also important to consider. Trump has not been friendly to China over the course of his candidacy by any metric: From accusations of manipulating currency value to threats of dramatically increased tariffs on Chinese goods, it is clear that a Trump presidency will inevitably lead to a conflict of some kind with China. Add to this the fact that there is also considerable international concern over China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, North Korea’s increasingly jingoistic attitude toward the West and Trump’s seeming approval of a nuclear South Korea and Japan. All considerations in this sphere point to alarming uncertainty in the future of America-Asia relations.
Finally, there is the elephant in the room: Trump’s promises about American domestic policy. Trump is about as far from a civil libertarian as a president can get, despite flip-flopping on issues such as free speech and religious liberty. From claims that he will find a way to locate and deport 11 million undocumented immigrants to a complete ban on all Muslim immigration, it is clear that Trump does not view immigrants as potential Americans. There is even doubt about how legal immigrants would be treated under a Trump administration. Trump has additionally promised to appoint justices to the Supreme Court that would challenge Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges, pivotal decisions that established the right to have an abortion and to marry someone of the same sex, respectively. Finally, Trump sees nothing wrong with reinstating interrogation techniques like waterboarding. The international community and Americans alike have decried waterboarding as a form of torture, which is prohibited under international law that the United States has acceded to. Even something as significant as this outcry will not likely stand between Trump and his goals, whatever those may actually be.
The consequences of Trump’s economic views are similarly opaque. Trump has sworn to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it, very specifically, with “something terrific.” Trump has also vowed to renegotiate NAFTA, which is a highly significant international trade deal that provides for a North American free market and closer relations between the United States, Canada and Mexico. As a vocal skeptic of global climate change, a Trump presidency may also result in a return to emphasizing American fossil fuel use rather than investing in a renewable energy grid. All of these decisions stand to do considerable damage to the United States economy in the short run, and their effects are likely to evoke economic volatility in years to come.
It has yet to be seen whether Republican nominee Donald Trump is the same man as President Donald Trump. What is paradoxically certain, though, is that there is great uncertainty about America’s future under the leadership of our President-elect.
The Democrats are not going ‘anywhere’ until they leave the 1960s behind.
THIS IS A MUST READ FOR ANYONE WHO ISTHINKING ABOUT WHAT JUST HAPPENED IN THE ELECTION. PLEASE CIRCULATE THIS MESSAGE ON CAMPUS!
It is hard me to believe that so many young Americans and Democrats are fearful of President Elect Donald Trump and The New Republican Party. Today’s Republican Party is the party protecting Americans rights and future. READ THIS ARTICLE.
These young people are protesting for a candidate whose message and history was that of corruption. The families Clinton Foundation is the center of the corruption. TAKE THE TIME TO READ ALL THE CLINTON FOUNDATION HISTORY OF CORRUPTION. THE OLDER GENRATION LIVED THROUGH IT THAT IS WHY THEY VOTED FOR REAL HOPE AND CHANGE.
Facts the Protesters do not know but need to hear.
AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING IN POVERTY IN THE US. THESE ARE FACTS. DO YOUR RESEARCH. PRESEDENT ELECT DONALD TRUMP LET AMARICA KNOW, 4 out of every 10 African Americans children under the age of 6 live in poverty. Think about these statistics. By the Democratic Party keeping this culture down it will create many more Americans with potential that will end up becoming in one way or another dependent on American Government. President Elect Trump offers a strong contrast to the historical norm. Let’s educate minorities, build minority infrastructure hubs and create jobs and opportunities for the minority cultures. THE MESSAGE AND PLAN IS REAL
97 MILLION AMERICANS are out of the work force. The US has about 350 Million people. The current administration was not reporting the actual facts.
The media is controlled by organizations looking to create a nationalized government. The reporters feel they are doing right because the information they are being feed by manipulated groups. Here is an Example and a dose of Truth.
 For starters, The Clinton’s used her Foundation as a way for people to gain access to Hillary’s State Department. Of the 154 people who had an audience with Secretary Clinton, 85 of them donated to her Foundation in some manner.
It is important to note that these weren’t small donors either. The 85 people gave a combined donation of $156 million to Clinton’s charity.
The Clinton Foundation has also received a number of donations which were from abusive and anti-American nations. This alone undercuts Hillary’s claim that she wanted to be a champion for minorities and women. These nations included Saudi Arabia, which has a notable ban on women operating a vehicle and is against gay rights. How many Americans are aware of this fact? The bigger question is why people especially young people would blindly follow a party and individual that was bought and paid for by special interests.
Bernie Sanders and the election process were manipulated so he did not win by the DNC. You do not hear the media talking or reporting about it. The past two DNC heads which we know about manipulated the selection process of the democratic selected candidate.
The reason Americans elected Donald Trump is because he is a true businessman and has the instinct and intelligence to lead our nation. He called out all the problems.
He is not represented properly by the media. It is propaganda. He was an amazing businessman and also in the T& A Industry. He was amazingly successful in both industries. Think about it, when a comedian develops an act, is that truly who the comedian is as a person. NO
Donald J. Trump is a true American hero. People who never stopped to research him or just blindly believed the media are being fooled. The 60 Million, Yes 60 Million American who voted for President Elect Trump, took the time to understand his true message.
Even if you doubt him, give him a chance. You will eventually look at him as an American Hero.
In history we had another President who used the same ideas to change and make America great. His name was Ronald Regan. He was a movie actor who starred in Bedtime for Bonzo. He became one of the great American Presidents in our history and helped all American People. Give President Trump a chance. Learn the real facts, Study WikiLeaks. God Bless America.
This is an opinion article for Americans to really consider.

A lot of people think about “what could have been.” They often think of those from the past as “the one that got away,” and they might imagine from time to time what it would or could have been if only things worked out.
This is all based on the idea of “potential,” a scary and truly unpredictable concept. “Potential” is often said with a positive connotation, but the word still gives space for infinite possibilities, good or bad. This risky concept mixed with timing can be especially complex in dating, and I as well have personally been left wondering what could have been because of these two concepts.
We first met in high school through mutual friends and hit it off. We chatted frequently through AIM Express and stayed connected by chatting on the phone almost every night. We ended up going to a high school dance together but after that, things cooled down.
We didn’t talk as much and got caught up in our own hobbies and busy academic schedules. It was serendipitous for us to end up at the same college two years later, where we reconnected and spent heaps of time together. I met him when he was a dorky high school boy and saw him transform into a handsome, professional man.
Throughout those years, we were always close and deeply cared for each other. All our mutual friends continuously teased us and asked why we weren’t together, which resulted in me trying to ask myself the same question. It took me a while to figure it out. In hindsight, though, it was actually a really simple answer: timing.
Many of us have experienced this frustrating feeling of meeting someone we can’t be with. Or sometimes we’re hurt over a relationship or fling that didn’t work out. Often, we are impatient with ourselves in these circumstances and create a mental hype based on potential. However, deep down (however far that may be) we know that it wasn’t meant to be. That realization might take some time to come to mind, too, but regardless, it’s important to value the beauty of timing and patience.
I truly believe that the universe’s sense of timing works in our favor. Some things just don’t work out, but for good reason, perhaps through things we don’t see. And when timing is good and things work out, it is for good reason. It’s all about learning to be patient, to allow things to fall in place as they should and to trust the process. Some things just truly take time, and if we don’t let them organically grow, then we’re cutting ourselves short with an artificial substitute.
He was kind and was with me through multiple sh-tty relationships, as I did for him. Yet there was never really a good time for either of us to give us a chance, although we were seemingly good together. At times it seemed frustrating but in hindsight it was a blessing. If we had been together, I possibly would have never met or gotten to know some amazing people in my life right now. He also probably wouldn’t have ended up with the fantastic girlfriend he has now. And for these things I am so thankful for being patient and allowing things to be the way they were.
These are things you probably have heard before: the value of patience and timings a b-tch. But in the midst of these two things I think we often forget to be grateful for the seeming complexity of the situation and simply trust the process. Instead of focusing on the now and continuously working to feed into our expectations and judgments of the situation, perhaps it’s best to just sit back and let things take their own course.

Brian Chin | Daily TrojanSophomore forward Bennie Boatwright and the men’s basketball team host Montana on Friday night in their season opener.
The Men of Troy tip-off their 2016-2017 campaign at 8 p.m. Friday against the Montana Grizzlies at the Galen Center.
Last year, the Trojans set a school record with 16 wins at home — including 15 home wins in a row — to start the year. This year’s young team seeks to begin the streak anew and set the tone for a another overachieving season.
While USC cracked the AP Top 25 on multiple occasions last season, the Trojans lost eight of their last 11 games and ultimately finished 9-9 in Pac-12 play. 2016 was still a highly successful year for the team that was projected to finish tenth in the conference.
This year’s squad is projected to finish seventh in the Pac-12 with another 9-9 record. However, no metric can gauge the preparedness of USC’s four talented freshmen recruits and two highly-touted transfers. The USA Today Coaches’ Poll ranks USC 39th, but Ken Pomeroy’s notorious “Pomeroy” metric has USC at 59th.
“We’re not ranked. We’re not one of the best teams in the nation,” junior guard Jordan McLaughlin said. “We just need to do our work early and make sure we’re prepared down the road. We just need to keep getting better every single day.”
At practice, the team seemed loose and ready to compete. Head coach Andy Enfield said he looks forward to measuring his team against another school after having numerous intrasquad scrimmages this preseason.
“It will be exciting for our four freshman and two transfers who have never played for us before,” Enfield said. “We’re looking for our four returners to carry the load early and then the other players have to produce for us to be able to compete.”
Enfield and his team have spent the week preparing for their first opponent — a Montana team that won 21 games last year. Though the Grizzlies lost their premier scorer, Martin Breunig (18.9 PPG), redshirt sophomore Oregon transfer Ahmaad Rorie is now eligible to compete. The 6’1” guard scored 27 points in the team’s final exhibition game last week. Guarding him will likely be a team effort, spearheaded by McLaughlin.
Additionally, the Grizzlies return two high volume three-point shooters — guard Bobby Moorehead and forward Jack Lopez.
“Their forwards play like guards,” Enfield said. “They’ll spread you out and try to shoot a lot of threes. We have to be able to guard the three-point line against this team. They’re excellent shooters.”
While USC’s bread and butter also comes from high volume three-point shooting, the Trojans have a phenomenal size advantage over the Grizzlies. No one on the Montana roster is listed above 6’8”, while USC has four players taller than 6’9”. Of those, only sophomore forward Chimeze Metu played significant minutes in the post last season. Sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright, the other contributing returner, prefered to play outside as a stretch-four. No doubt, Friday night’s game will be a benchmark of his developing post game and rebounding ability. Against an undersized Montana team, the other three USC big men — redshirt senior, Charles Buggs, and freshmen, Nick Rakocevic and Harrison Henderson — could have thrilling debuts.
Following their game against Montana, the Trojans tip-off against the Omaha Mavericks on Sunday at 4 p.m. Projected to finish fourth in the Summit League, Omaha is anchored by upperclassmen leadership. Senior guard Tra-Deon Hollins and junior forward Tre’Shawn Thurman earned preseason All-Summit honors.
Hollins can do it all. Last season, the junior college transfer and Omaha native averaged 12.5 points, 4.8 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 4.0 steals per game. His all-around performance earned him First-Team All-Summit, Summit League Defensive Player of the Year, Summit League Transfer of the Year and Summit All-Newcomer honors.
Thurman, the 6’7” forward, brings athleticism to the Mavs frontcourt. He blocked a team-high 35 shots last year, finished first in rebounding (6.7 RPG) and third in scoring (13.9 PPG). USC will have to use its superior size to push Thurman out of the paint. While the Mavs have several guys bigger than Thurman, no one rebounds as well and no one has nearly as much experience.
In both games, the Trojans must exert their length on the perimeter and size in the paint. It will be a test for a team that struggled last year to defend the paint, rebound and play half-court offense.
While Montana and Omaha don’t sound like flashy opponents, they are the perfect competitors for the Trojans to begin the year. The Trojans should be able to outrun and outshoot both of these teams playing much the way they did last year, but these games are opportunities for the young squad to play big and work on parts of the game that ailed the team a year ago. It will be interesting to see Enfield’s game plan evolve over the weekend and how early and often his young bench gets playing time.

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanHolding it together · Head coach Clay Helton’s season turned around after he named redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold the starter in Week 4. This week, the Trojans face No. 4 Washington.
The last time USC faced Washington, it was the final game before all hell broke loose and a new era of the football program emerged, for better or for worse.
You probably recall it — the No. 17 Trojans entering as double-digit favorites against the unranked Huskies at the Coliseum on a Thursday night in October. You remember it being utterly depressing — former quarterback Cody Kessler throwing two interceptions, the Huskies taking the lead on a trick play and then closing out a 17-12 win. But that was hardly the story.
It was the tweet-storm that emerged in the weekend that followed: then-head coach Steve Sarkisian showing up to practice inebriated, revelations that he was drunk on the sidelines two weeks prior against Arizona State, the indefinite leave of absence followed quickly by the firing and the public humiliation of USC somehow topping itself when it comes to football controversies.
And from all this emerged a forced changing of the guard and the emergence of Clay Helton, a man who has been tabbed with bringing USC back to its glory days.
Now, a year removed from the forgettable unfortunate series of events, the Trojans have another date with the Huskies, and it could mark another shift for USC to pull off a road upset against a team seemingly destined for the College Football Playoff.
A win over fourth-ranked Washington would prove so many things. For one, it would validate the five-game win streak the Trojans are currently on as a sign of an improving team rather than the result of a favorable schedule. Since losing to Utah on Sept. 23, USC has beaten Arizona State, Colorado, Cal and Oregon at home and Arizona on the road. Of those teams, Colorado is probably the only quality opponent in what has been a very strange season for the Pac-12.
The Washington game is USC’s first chance to redeem themselves on the national spotlight since the season-opening debacle against Alabama. With the game being broadcast on FOX, a 4:30 p.m. PST kickoff and one of just two matchups between Top 25 teams, the game will receive a lot of eyeballs from fans wondering whether the Huskies can maintain their top-four spot or if USC is really on the rise again.
If they are, then beating this Washington team on Saturday would send a statement, and look no further than the respective sidelines as to why. In hindsight, it’s a given that USC should have hired Chris Petersen — now the head coach of the Huskies — instead of Sarkisian in 2013 to replace Lane Kiffin. Petersen was an up-and-coming, smart football mind who had built a perennial contender at Boise State and was willing to jump ship to a bigger program. But an interview with then-Athletic Director Pat Haden wound up being akin to a “bad date,” according to ESPN. Instead, Haden tapped Sarkisian — the Huskies coach at the time — and the domino effect resulted in Peterson replacing Sarkisian at Washington.
Since then, the Sarkisian debacle has kept USC stagnant, while Petersen has built a monster at Washington that is finally rearing its head in his third season. His team is 9-0 and has its best chance to win its first national championship since 1991. He has a Heisman-contending quarterback in Jake Browning who is just a sophomore. He has the best scoring offense and best scoring defense in the Pac-12, which does not seem fair. He has a speedy wide receiver in John Ross and a shutdown corner in Kevin King, both of whom are significant because they were part of Sarkisian’s recruiting at Washington.
I’m sure USC would love to forget about Sarkisian, but his fingerprints are all over this game. He recruited players who have helped turn the Huskies program around and could cause fits on Saturday for USC, the same program that Sarkisian royally embarrassed in his short tenure.
But the irony here goes three or four levels deep. Petersen, the coach that USC could have had instead of Sarkisian, has constructed a balanced system that the Trojans are trying to emulate.
“Two really similar teams,” Helton said about the Huskies this week. “We look at their offense to be able to look at what they’re doing against other defenses because formationally, personnel, we’re so similar.”
The difference, though, is that USC is more like Washington-light, ranked middle-of-the pack in the Pac-12 in both total offense and defense while the Huskies lead in both categories. For the Trojans to beat the Huskies, redshirt freshman quarterback Sam Darnold will have to play the best game of his young career, and the Trojans will have to go much further than simply duplicating their effort during this five-game win streak.
If they do, then not only will the Trojans have pulled off a significant upset, but they also would have beaten a program they look up to with a coach that should be on their sideline and players who were recruited by the calamity of a coach they hired instead. And Helton, the benefactor of all of the above, would have his first signature win and redeem USC from the failures of years’ past. How’s that for the start of a new era?

Tal Volk | Daily TrojanTime to lock it down · Junior corner back Adoree’ Jackson and the No. 20 Trojans are traveling to Seattle where they will face the No. 4 Huskies. Jackson and the defense are preparing for the highest scoring offense in the Pac-12.
The Trojans have a five-game win streak on the line. The Huskies have a 12-game win streak, but one of these will end on Saturday when No. 4 Washington hosts No. 20 USC.
Washington (9-0, 6-0) brings one of the most prolific offenses and stalwart defenses in the country into this game. Behind sophomore quarterback Jake Browning, the Huskies are averaging a conference-high 48.3 points per game. Their defense allows the fewest points per game at only 17.0.
“It’s the most balanced team that we’ve played,” head coach Clay Helton said. “You look up and they have 231 yards rushing and 268 passing. They’re able to lean on the run game maybe when the quarterback is off.”
The fewest points the Huskies have been held to this season is 31 in their win against Utah, but the Trojan defense is confident after holding both Cal and Oregon to season-lows in scoring. Luckily for USC, Helton said he expects redshirt senior defensive tackle Stevie Tu’ikolovatu to play and isn’t worried about whether or not he will be limited because Washington runs so few plays.
“He’s a warrior,” Helton said. “He told me when we walked off the field that he was going to play in the game.” 
Another boost for the Trojan defense comes with Helton’s announcement that sophomore defensive back Iman Marshall will also be in the lineup.
Not only is the Husky attack balanced, but it is also efficient. Washington converts on 46.9 percent of their third downs.
“When you’re playing a ball-controlled offense and know you’re going to have limited possessions, Washington averages only 65 plays a game, third downs are going to be key,” Helton said. “We put a lot of concerted effort into that today.”
Defensive efforts will be spread thin, as there is no one clear rush or pass threat, but Browning’s favorite target is wide receiver John Ross, who leads the Pac-12 with 14 touchdown receptions.
“He does a lot of things well, especially when he gets the ball in his hands,” junior corner back Adoree’ Jackson said. “He’s one of those guys where he can stop on a dime. He can run nice routes. And that’s pretty much what is on film; you just see a good player out there.”
Just behind Ross in touchdowns is wide receiver Dante Pettis, who has caught 11 this season.
On both sides of the ball, the Trojans need to play well and avoid controllable mistakes. 
“You better play clean football because you aren’t going to get many possessions in the game,” Helton said. “If you’re not good on third downs, if you have penalties, if you turn it over, you’re going to set yourself back against an offense that averages 48 points off of 65 plays.”
USC is 10th in the Pac-12 in penalties, averaging 71.6 yards per game because of them. Washington on the other hand, is first in the conference, with only 44.8 penalty yards per game.
Converting on third downs is critical to keeping the chains moving and the Trojan defense off the field. USC is third in the conference, converting on 45.3 percent of their third downs. Washington has 27 sacks this season, tied for second in the Pac-12. Helton has expressed his concern over their pass-rush, especially on third down.
Additional good news on the injury front for USC came with the full practice of senior running back Justin Davis and sophomore running back Aca’Cedric Ware. The pair of backs will join sophomore Ronald Jones II, who has been dominant in Davis’ absence. 
In their past three games, the Trojan running back corps has earned 320, 398 and 270 yards on the ground. During their five-game win streak, USC has averaged 571 yards of total offense, with coaches and players alike praising the performance of the offensive line.
“If we’re just able to keep this going, we’re a force to be reckoned with,” redshirt senior offensive lineman Zach Banner said. “I love the pace that we’re going at right now.”
The game kicks off at 4:30 from Husky Stadium in Seattle and is being televised by FOX. ESPN’s College Gameday will also be covering the game, broadcasting live from the University of Washington from 6 a.m.- 9 a.m.

Matt Karatsu | Daily TrojanAll on the line · Junior driver Grant Stein and the No. 2 Trojans face crosstown rivals and undefeated No. 1 UCLA at home on Saturday.
For the No. 1 UCLA Bruin and the No. 2 Trojan men’s water polo teams, Saturday’s season finale is more than just a rivalry game. It’s redemption.
As documented in the UCLA-USC rivalry, there is no sport as contentious as men’s water polo during regular and postseason competition in recent years. 
In their final home game of the 2016 regular season, the Trojans (19-1) will battle the Bruins (24-0) for the nation’s number one spot, intercity bragging rights and most importantly, revenge after UCLA defeated USC in the 2015 NCAA Championship game.
“Our expectation every single game is to get better. We want to focus on the little things and trying to get every little thing right so that when we get into these big moments we can execute and play our game,” junior utility James Walters said. “If we shut them down the way we want to, I’m sure we’ll win.” 
Though USC downed UCLA in the 2009, 2011 and 2012 NCAA finals, the Men of Troy have lost the past two NCAA championships to their crosstown rivals. 
In an apparent stray from tradition, Saturday’s game is the first time that the two teams will play each other all season despite being in the same conference. 
USC will have to strictly rely on game footage and statistical analysis to prepare for this game. 
UCLA boasts an unblemished 24-0 record in 2016 and 57-game winning streak. 
Thanks to a balanced offensive attack and shut-down defense, UCLA has sustained a No. 1 ranking in the NCAA throughout the season.
On offense, Patrick Fellner leads the Bruins with 33 goals scored and there are an additional four players who have scored more than 20 goals. As a team, UCLA averages 13.1 goals scored per game, while starting goalie Garrett Danner is averaging 10.4 saves and 5.3 goals-against per game. 
Freshman driver Marin Dasic stressed after the Trojan’s 19-1 victory over San Jose State on Sunday that while UCLA — and 6-foot-7 center Alec Zwaneveld — are impressive defensively, head coach Jovan Vavic will prepare them well.
“They are a very good team defensively. We have to watch out for their center because he’s so big,” Dasic said. “That’s what Coach has told us, and whatever Coach tells us to do, we go and do it. He is the mastermind of this team.”
Thankfully for a USC team that is 65-54-1 all-time but 0-7 in the last seven games against UCLA, this year’s team is efficient on both sides of the ball. 
Along with averaging over 16 goals offensively, USC’s junior goalie McQuin Baron is averaging 10.85 saves and just 4.0 goals-against per game, both tops in the MPSF. 
In fact, USC’s defense is so suffocating that it has shut out opponents in 33 out of 80 total periods this year (41 percent), with just five games with over four goals allowed. Baron’s job, however, would not be complete without this season’s powerful offensive performances by junior two-meter Lachlan Edwards (30 goals) and junior drivers Blake Edwards (36), Matteo Morelli (36) and Grant Stein (25).
Though UCLA has yet to lose a game, the Trojans have dominated teams that UCLA barely escaped. 
For example, against top-ranked Stanford, Cal, UC Santa Barbara, Long Beach State, Pacific and San Jose State, UCLA scored an average of 8.4 goals while giving up 6. Compared to the Bruins’ 3-goal margin of victory, the Trojans fared much better against top competition, defeating those schools by an average margin of nearly seven goals per game (122 scored, 50 allowed).
Regardless of what happens on Saturday night, this will be a huge indicator of what will come later on in the season — particularly the 2016 NCAA Championship.
“I’m really excited for this game, because they’ve beaten us in the past few games,” Morelli said. “There should be a huge crowd, and we’re ready for it. The two biggest games of my career were in the finals against them. A win will be crucial for us going into the MPSF [playoffs].”
The game begins at 11 a.m. on Saturday at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.

Several hundred middle and high schoolers from the 32nd Street School gathered on campus Thursday afternoon to protest Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. 
They were joined by USC students and faculty as they marched down Trousdale, eventually gathering near Tommy Trojan and chanting “Not our president” and “Si, se puede,” or“yes, we can” in Spanish. Many held signs proclaiming solidarity with minority groups and denouncing Trump and the Republican Party as fascist. Others held up flags from Mexico and El Salvador, expressing solidarity in reference to Trump’s claims that he would deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants currently residing in the U.S.
“We are proud of our country,” one protester holding up a Salvadoran flag said in Spanish. “We want to tell Donald Trump that he cannot deport us, and that he cannot destroy us.” 
Students explained that seniors at the 32nd Street School collectively decided to come to USC in order to “make their voices heard.” 
“We’re very upset about what happened during the election and how many people were influenced by hate,” said Reginald Albert, a high school senior from the 32nd Street School. 
Other protestors held up the rainbow flag of the LGBT movement while many chanted “the people united will never be divided.” The group rallied in front of the Student Union, then began to disperse as some moved toward Exposition Park while others marched out onto Figueroa Street. USC students and faculty formed a “human wall” along Trousdale, then gathered around Tommy Trojan to take turns speaking about what the possibility of a Trump presidency means for them.
 
One student said that as an undocumented immigrant, she had been taken in by a white woman who helped her eventually get to USC. She urged students to stay united against hate in the face of divisive rhetoric. 
“This proves that not everyone is racist,” she said. “There are good people out there.” 
By 1:00 p.m., the majority of the protesters had moved off campus. A group of around 200 people from USC made its way down Figueroa Street toward Downtown, where 28 people were arrested Wednesday night in protests that blocked the 101 Freeway, according to ABC News. A group marched back onto campus near 2:00 p.m. yelling, “F–k Donald Trump” as they moved down Trousdale toward Tommy Trojan.

Protests have erupted on campus and in the greater Los Angeles community in the wake of Tuesday night’s election results, which propelled Donald Trump to the presidency.
Early on Wednesday morning just after the results were announced, nearly 150 USC students held a spontaneous protest near Tommy Trojan. One student called for students to oppose an oppressive system that discriminates against minorities.
“We’re not against white people – we’re against white supremacy, the white supremacists and patriarchy,” one student said. “We’re going to have to wake up and take back our country for the people, not for these political parties, not for Democrats and Republicans, to free people from oppression.”
On Wednesday night, hundreds of people circled around the Los Angeles City Hall, going on the freeway, waving anti-trump posters and chanting “F-ck Donald Trump,” drowning out car honks. The event organized by individuals from the Answer Coalition was aimed at protesting Donald Trump’s presidential win.
After circling the City Hall building, the crowd, composed mostly of students and young adults, stopped in front of it and began chanting slogans such as, “Hey hey ho ho Donald trump has got to go,” “Not my president” and “No KKK, No fascist USA, No Trump.” Posters contained messages such as “Stand with immigrants, black lives, Muslims, LGBTQ people, and low-wage workers.”
One protester sported a Guy Fawkes mask, while others brandished pig masks and even Trump’s decapitated head on a stick. A few people climbed on top of the traffic pole, waving the Mexican and American flags, almost lighting the latter on fire before someone else in the crowd stopped them, saying that the protest was about love and not hate.
A megaphone was passed around, giving people a chance to voice how they felt.
“I’m the child of immigrants, and I got pregnant at 16, and I was lucky enough to get an abortion, and I didn’t have anyone challenge my rights,” said one young woman present at the event. “But I still had [people] follow me to my mother’s car and scream in my face when I was having the worst day of my life. I have never ever regretted that decision. [Support] reproductive rights!”
Several USC students attended the rally as well, including senior Beatrix Lu.
“I think it’s really important to show that Trump is not a president for all the people like he said he would be,” Lu said. “Even though a democratic transition is the hallmark of our democracy, that’s why we’re here protesting, as is our right, as opposed to violently being in the streets. We are here to show him that love does trump hate,” Lu said.
According to Lu, the goal of the protest was to show that people Trump has insulted throughout the campaign would not allow his win to silence them.
“The problem with Trump is that no one knows what his policies actually are, because he is a demagogue and he tended to flip-flop on everything, but we reject that our lives do not matter to him, as women, as queers and as people of color,” Lu said.
Junior Michelle Montepiedra, who majors in international relations, also voiced her opposition to Trump’s presidency.
“I and a lot of students have more knowledge than Donald Trump, and I don’t think that’s right, where we’re college students and we know more than our president,” Montepiedra said. “I hope I can make my voice heard and amplify the other voices here.”
While I share the position of opposing Trump, I also acknowledge that he will be the President, including your and my President.  I do not wish him failure, because that is America’s failure.
On the other hand, there are ways to oppose what he might do, within the legal framework.
Stupid demonstrations ACCOMPLISH *nothing*.  It will not stop his inauguration, it may only provoke backlash against those you care about.
Join the only organization that presently exists to combat Trump:  the Democratic Party.
Students now carry a big burden:  They did not get out and vote, as a group.  They stayed home like petulant children.  Now, they allow themselves to be manipulated by various factions that are not about love, but about hate, and about violence, and about chaos, and attacking all institutions of America.
You don’t make ANYTHING better by blocking roads, and making it hard for working people to get to work, or to pick up their children from childcare.  In fact, you are telling them that Trump is RIGHT, and you push them into his arms—–because they are working people, and you don’t care about THEM—just like he said.
Consider your actions carefully….
grow up and get a job… omg – I do not know what happened.. these generation of whiners came out of hard working people…  didn’t you guys learn a thing besides whine???
Whatever happened to the tolerance that you folks espoused over all these years?  The vote for Trump has proven that the direction America was being steered towards was not workkng, so we have taken control back from the oppression of the Obama admin, the Leftists that drive the Democratic Party aka the New American Socialist Party.
The protests and destruction we are seeing being reported around the country are not spontaneous events.  They are planned and funded by anarchist groups who want to continue to control and manipulate the weak minded, the mentally ill, the crazy people, uninformed citizens and non citizens to revolt.   
Do you want to a part of something that is destructive and evil or be a part of the American dream and continue to pursue your education and then enter adulthood with a degree and a job?
The information you’ve been fed by Hillary and the Left’s propaganda machine ab I UT Trump being a racist, muslim hater, anti abortionist are all wrong. The Left’s goal is to manipulate you in order to continue to exercise their power and control over you.  Yes you.
Read up on a Trump’s platform and you’ll see that he’s not what Hillary and others have portrayed him to be.
As for the abortion issue, Trump’s  personal philosophy will not be law. The law is the law and we want the law to be taken care of and followed.
What we do want is to make it illegal to abort baby’s just for the convenience of the mother. Birth control is not to be used for aborting your baby. There are too many devices and means of providing responsible and effective birth control today vs when Roe v Wade was made law.
Yes we all have heard that women want the right to choose how they manage their personal healthcare, so m if that’s true:
1.  Be responsible for yourself and get on a birth control regimen
2.  If you get pregnant, keep the baby to term and put y I ur child up for adopti I n.  There are thousands of couples who cannot conceive who would a sweet, adorable American baby where the history of the mother can be documented.
3.  You want control over your body as you say, then take control over your pocket book and stop going after the sperm donor. Stop forcing the courts to effect child support from the guy you had casual sex with.  He doesn’t have a say about your decision to keep or not keep the baby.  Be responsible for yourself.
You cannot have it both ways. It’s hypocritical to rational thought.

Students and faculty struggled to come to terms Wednesday with the election of Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, as numerous groups and individuals expressed uncertainty and concern over the country’s future.
A panel featuring Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Ernest Wilson III, School of Journalism Director Willow Bay, School of Communication Director Sarah Banet-Weiser, Vice Dean Philip Seib and professors Burghardt Tenderich, Judy Muller, Miki Turner and Gabriel Kahn met in Wallis Annenberg Hall Wednesday afternoon to discuss how the election will impact both the journalism industry and the millennial generation as a whole. 
Professor Tenderich called on the audience to understand their privilege as a college educated group and encouraged greater empathy toward Trump supporters.
“It’s the elite talking to the elite,” Tenderich said of mainstream liberal political thought. “The worst thing we can do is blame the people who voted for Trump yesterday. We need to understand we live in a bubble.”
Muller went on to point out that in light of Tuesday’s results, Americans will face a political system dominated by one party, the Republicans. She said that this served as an “awakening” for how important the jobs of journalism and communication students are when it comes to informing the public about political events.
“I’m talking about being the watchdog,” Muller said. “You will be going out at a time when all branches of government are controlled by one party. This is what the press was born to do.” 
In light of this, students asked for specific direction on how to express their discontent with the outcome of the election.
“As a child of the ’60s, I think there’s nothing wrong with peaceful protest,” Muller said. “I think it’s a very valuable exercise and I don’t think it’s useless at all.”
Banet-Weiser too encouraged action. She noted that because of the election results, she struggled to speak without crying for much of the morning and asked students to mobilize based off their frustration.
“Use your anger,” she said. “Do something. Organize. Get in a group.” 
Wilson followed by encouraging mass unity among student groups, though noted USC’s campus lacked vocal activism. 
“Part of the challenge is that you’re on a campus that doesn’t get real excited about political stuff,” Wilson said. “There has been a lot of demonstrations across the country, we really haven’t had that.”
The panelists also highlighted the mistakes made by the mainstream media during the election, especially in failing to recognize and report on the problems facing the so-called “silent majority,” whose strong voter turnout was ultimately responsible for pushing Trump to the presidency. According to Seib, it was this oversight that was responsible for boosting Trump to his unexpected win. 
“In terms of covering what America is, journalists will have to give a lot of thought on exactly what criteria they’re looking at,” Seib said. “Obviously, there’s a tremendous amount of anger out there, a tremendous amount of fear, and the news coverage, for the most part, missed all of that.” 
While Seib said that Trump’s victory Tuesday night showed the deep disconnect between mainstream media and Trump supporters, several students added that it also highlighted the divide between Americans that was increasingly exposed during the 2016 election cycle.
“I don’t think I’ve ever been a part of an experience related to our country where people are feeling so dejected, feeling so lost and hurt,” said JT Arowosaye, a junior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. “But in stark contrast, there are people who are elated, and so happy, and so thrilled, and fathoming that disconnect between people right now is hard for me. I don’t know how to communicate with people who voted for someone who I feel puts my life and my family and friends’ lives in jeopardy, but I guess I have four years to figure that all out.”
Darrell Florence Jr., a junior majoring in business administration, said that he believes students are not doing enough to foment change and bridge this divide, largely due to a lack of communication between different communities on campus and a failure to ask the questions needed to catalyze meaningful conversations. 
 “We’re trained to ask questions that sound intelligent but don’t really get to the root of the problem,” Florence said. “We need to be asking ourselves and asking each other, ‘How do we get along and fix this together?’ We’re not doing enough.”

More than 100 students gathered at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to discuss the victory of  Donald Trump in the presidential election and its impact on the future of the United States on Wednesday evening.
“What Comes Next,” co-hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Office of the Provost, was led by a panel of USC professors and faculty members who addressed some of the key issues witnessed during the election and highlight possible changes Americans can anticipate in the near future. The event aimed to enable faculty and students to collectively digest the outcome of the election in a respectful and safe environment. Panelists included Dan Schnur, the director of the Unruh Institute, Camille Gear-Rich, the associate provost for Faculty and Student Initiatives in the Social Sciences, Niels Frenzen, the director of the Immigration Clinic at the USC Gould School of Law and Clare Pastore, a law professor at USC.
Schnur stressed the importance of having students feel comfortable participating in the sensitive discourse and encouraged students to ask questions to the ideologically diverse panel members. 
“While most of us are not in the position to sign or veto legislation in Washington, D.C., it seems to me that the real impact is not what happens in Washington, but what happens in neighborhoods, communities and campuses,” Schnur said. “Perhaps we really do have a vital role to play.” 
Gear-Rich pointed out that though many USC students had voiced their concern and surprise over Trump’s victory, the discussion was created to offer guidance and reassurance to those who felt disillusioned by the outcome of the election. 
“One of the most important things we can do tonight is to deal with the issues head on, think about issues in terms of their policy implications and look at the issues with a very sharp lens with careful way of talking to each other,” Gear-Rich said. 
Students were reminded that the United States has faced controversial problems in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Schnur said, working together to find common ground was a priority for all Americans. More importantly, the panel emphasized how conversations similar to this one are necessary in order to bring different political and social outcomes in the future. 
Furthermore, Schnur said that people should focus more on the actual policies and political agendas of U.S. politicians, rather than the personalities of the leaders. 
“Although personality could be captivating, the role of public policy is worth our primary consideration,” Schnur said. 
Frenzen discussed the fear many immigrant communities are currently experiencing due to Trump’s statements that he would deport undocumented immigrants living in the United States. He also voiced his concern over the possibility that Trump may eliminate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals Act, which would leave the 700,000 people who were granted work permits under this provision at a disadvantage. 
Frenzen also reminded the audience that nonviolent protests have previously had a tremendous and effective impact in U.S. policymaking. He used the 2006 L.A. immigration reform protests as an example, describing how half a million Americans gathered in the city to oppose the Border Protection, Antiterrorism and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005.
As the panel went on, one student expressed her concerns about the polarized nature of the media, while another asked about the problems America faces when it comes to using and generating renewable and nonrenewable energy. Some of the other issues brought up had to do with health care policy, the state of the environment and stock market prices. 
The panel ended on an optimistic note, with Schnur stressing the advantages of technological improvements that enable people to communicate regardless of their socioeconomic and ideological background. 
The panel agreed that technology empowers people to voice their ideas and live as open-minded individuals. 
“Not only can we talk back to power, but more importantly, technology means that we can communicate horizontally with each other,” Schnur said.

Consul General of Mexico Carlos García de Alba spoke about his role in diplomacy and the impact of a Trump presidency on U.S.-Mexico relations with a group of students and faculty Wednesday evening. 
The event was organized by AEM Jóvenes Los Angeles, an international organization that helps Mexican businesspeople and professionals achieve success in the United States. Consul of Cultural Affairs Andrés Webster and Vice President for Strategic and Global Initiatives Anthony Bailey were also present.
 García became the Consul General of Los Angeles in June. He started his career 30 years ago and has since worked in Canada, Italy, Indonesia, El Salvador, Dallas, France and Ireland. Throughout his career abroad, he has continued to travel back to Mexico on a regular basis.
In response to a question about how the consulate’s strategy has changed due to the result of the presidential election, García said that Mexico was ready to work with Trump but would wait to make any guarantees until he made several important decisions, such as appointing a cabinet. 
“We still don’t know if he has the intention of moving forward with the wall, deporting people working here and more,” García said. “In the meantime, the consulate is working as hard as possible on a daily basis. If he really starts deporting people, you can imagine the kind of emergency we will face in the coming months.”
García added that Trump’s outspoken claims that he would deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants working in the U.S. would hurt the economies of both countries if they were acted upon. 
“If President Trump decides to deport them, I don’t see the Americans doing [the Mexicans’] jobs,” García said. “My only wish is that both countries keep working hard, [because] there is a huge connection between them. I hope that everything will keep moving smoothly.”
García brought up the importance of diplomacy in the modern era, and the efforts that Mexico is making to reach out to other nations. According to García, Mexico has 73 embassies around the world.
“It’s still not enough,” García said. “According to the United Nations, there are now 208 nations around the world.”
García said the consulate has two main jobs: protection and documentation. The consulate serves to protect Mexicans living abroad, as well as providing them with identification, passport replacements, notary services and more.
He added that promotion has become a major part of his job. One way the consulate is encouraging promotion at USC is through “La Carte de la México,” which President C. L. Max Nikias is set to sign later this week. This document proposes that the consulate brings a prestigious Mexican, particularly some kind of artist, to speak about Mexico every year. The consulate offers internships to students who are interested.
García also addressed the Mexican diaspora, the second largest diaspora in the world. He said that out of the 125 million residents of Mexico, roughly 10 percent permanently live abroad. Furthermore, 97 percent of those people live in the United States, making the relationship between the two countries that much more important.
“There is not a single state in the U.S. with fewer than 10,000 Mexicans,” García said.
García also spoke about the ways that immigration from Mexico has changed over time. From 1850 to 1950, just over 4,000 Mexicans were moving to the United States each year. In 1980, 2.5 million crossed the border to the United States. However, García said that Mexican immigration to the United States has slowed down dramatically in the last five years. He added that the profile of Mexican immigrants has changed greatly in the last 20 to 25 years.
“Historically speaking, Mexicans coming to the United States were from four states in central and western Mexico,” García said. “After 1980, almost everybody started moving to the United States. Almost every single state in Mexico had this transfer of migrants.”
Today, 47 percent of immigrants from Mexico are women, meaning that more families are migrating together. Approximately 1 million Mexican immigrants in the United States are professionals and executives. However, García brought up that many undocumented immigrants who come to the United States from Mexico face issues working and earning a living. 
“When you are a worker in the U.S. with no papers and you are not getting paid enough, you can ask your boss to be paid,” García said. “Many [people without papers] are scared to ask because they could get deported. Even when you don’t have papers, you have rights, [and] many people don’t know that.”
