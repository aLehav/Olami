With college football finally reaching its offseason, players and coaches across the country are finding new programs to call home. One hire that caught the eye of many college football fans was Deion Sanders’ move from Jackson State University to the University of Colorado.
The legendary NFL Hall of Fame cornerback became the first head coach to move from a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) to a Power 5 school. Sanders’ decision caused some uproar in the college football community, as some felt that Sanders abandoned Jackson State and the mission to grow HBCU football programs. 
But again, it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity. Sanders is paving the way for Black coaches to get high profile, well-paying jobs, the kind which are rarely available to the nation’s thousands of football coaches. Sanders joins a very small list of Black head coaches in Division I football, bringing the total to 15 out of 131 head coaches.
Among the NFL’s 32 teams, there are currently four Black head coaches: Todd Bowles, Lovie Smith, Mike Tomlin and Mike McDaniel. Back in 2021, the sacking of then Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores brought attention to the treatment of and hiring process for Black coaches in the NFL. After being shunned by the other teams in the league, Flores filed a class-action lawsuit against the NFL, the New York Giants, the Denver Broncos and the Dolphins. Flores stated that the Giants interviewed him simply to bypass the Rooney Rule, which requires organizations to interview minority candidates for available head coaching positions, and never genuinely considered him for the job.
The same disparity plagues Major League Baseball. There are only 2 Black managers currently active: Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Dusty Baker of this season’s World Series champions, the Houston Astros. Roberts and Baker are two of only three Black managers to ever lead their teams to a World Series triumph, with Roberts doing so in 2020 and Cito Gaston being the first in 1992 and 1993.
Looking overseas, Arsenal legend and French manager Patrick Vieira is the only Black manager in the Premier League out of 20 current managers. To make matters worse, he is one of just two Black managers coaching in the top five leagues — encompassing 98 teams — the other being his French compatriot Antoine Kombouaré. 
“Overall I believe that the doors are not open for us to do what we can do and to go into management. When I talk about management I’m talking about the team, but I’m also talking about the higher level as well,” Vieira said to BBC Sport in October.
In the NBA, there has actually been some amazing progress. Household names like Doc Rivers and Tyronn Lue have had lengthy coaching careers in the association for the 76ers and Clippers respectively, but there are a lot of fresh faces now. This season, 15 of the 30 NBA teams are led by Black head coaches, a record-high for the Association and a stark increase from the measly two Black head coaches in the league for the 1991-92 season.
“When my son, and my oldest son’s about to have his first son, when they turn on the TV and they see people that look like them leading an NBA team on the sidelines, it can be inspiring. For me, carrying the torch and then passing it to the next generation is something that I think about often — not just for my family, but for others out there,” said Mike Brown, the Sacramento Kings’ head coach, to Tim Reynolds, an NBA writer for the Associated Press. 
The NBA has been the most diversely staffed of all the world’s major sports, currently seeing its most diverse era. However, one of the issues Black NBA coaches have faced is that, while they have finally been given opportunities to coach teams, they haven’t necessarily lasted long in their roles and often haven’t been given second chances, instead reverting back to assistant coaching positions or other roles. According to Reynolds, most Black coaches “either lasted in their first job no more than three years or [didn’t get] a second chance at leading a team.”
Many coaches and players have been vocal about addressing that pattern; the NBA Coaches Equality Initiative, which aims to develop diverse talent in the league’s coaching staffs, was launched after a meeting between Commissioner Adam Silver and the National Basketball Coaches Association.
It’s clear to see that progress is being made, however more efforts need to be made to give minority coaches opportunities and make these positions sustainable. Many new Black coaches are not just leaders for their respective teams, but also examples for aspiring coaches to take charge without fear of discrimination.

On Sunday night, the city of Los Angeles witnessed another electrifying match-up between the USC Trojans and UCLA Bruins’ women’s basketball teams, who are both playing impressive and improving seasons thus far. 
The rivals clashed at Pauley Pavilion where a sea of blue was dotted with specks of the Trojan family. Yet, the passionate UCLA fanbase was the least of USC’s concerns. USC’s standout player so far this year, graduate forward Kadi Sissoko, was out with a leg injury, putting pressure on the team for someone to step up in her absence.    
USC won the tip-off and were off to the races of what would end up being their toughest game of the year. While the match-up was a high scoring game, it started off very slow. The first two possessions for both teams ended with no scoring and it was clear that each side had nerves about the cross-town rivalry. 
Eventually UCLA broke the ice with a lay-up by their freshman standout, Kiki Rice. UCLA proceeded to score another basket in which USC’s junior guard, Kayla Williams, had enough and aggressively attacked the basket and was fouled. Williams went 2 for 2 from the free throw line and gave the Trojans their first points. The rest of the quarter consisted of both teams inconsistently trading baskets and the first quarter ended with a score of 17-19 in favor of the Bruins.  
The Trojans did not let the back and forth first quarter impact their morale by any means and came out the next firing from all ceilings. Sophomore star Rayah Marshall was no longer quiet in the game, scoring two quick buckets that were followed by a momentum-spurring three-point shot by Kayla Williams. 
The Trojans won the quarter 17-11, putting them up by 4 heading into halftime. The scoring run by USC was impressive to all in the arena, even to UCLA’s Head Coach Cori Close. Before entering the locker room tunnel, Close was stopped to answer a few questions pertaining to the first half of gameplay and admitted to not being able to stop USC’s halfcourt sets and playing in favor of the Trojans.  
After a rejuvenating 15-minute halftime, the Trojans and Bruins made their way back to the court to a heated end to the game. Within the first two minutes of the fourth quarter there were 6 fouls against the Trojans, with three of those fouls coming within 10 seconds of each other. 
The USC fans were livid towards the referees meanwhile the UCLA fan base remained quiet in what seemed to be an understanding that the fouls called were undignified. Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb and staff remained as composed as they could while witnessing their team face such adversity by the officiating crew. The fouls called against the Trojans served as a catalyst for UCLA’s 21-8 point run against the Trojans, which led the Bruins to their second win over the Trojans this season. 
“When you have a selfless team, and a neutral team, […] then we get ready for big moments when we need it. And Londynn Jones was ready for that big moment,” Close said. 
USC will face UC Berkeley at Galen Center on Friday at 7 p.m.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault.
A former USC fraternity president is seeking to overturn his 2021 expulsion over sexual misconduct allegations, according to a Thursday City News Service report.
The former student, identified as John Doe in a Los Angeles Superior Court petition filed Wednesday, was found in violation of “multiple instances of non-consensual anal penetration” of his accuser by an internal Title IX hearing. The lawsuit states the student was denied due process in the hearing and that community and media influenced the decision.
No criminal case was filed against Doe, but the University imposed expulsion, prohibited Doe’s presence from University property and ordered him not to contact his accuser. In a separate investigation, the University cleared Doe’s fraternity of all allegations.
According to Doe’s petition, he met his woman accuser, identified as Jane Roe, at an L.A. nightclub in October 2021. The two became intimate at Doe’s fraternity residence, but Doe complied when Roe asked him to stop, the suit states. The following afternoon, officers from the Los Angeles Police Department and Department of Public Safety questioned Doe about the nature of his encounter with his accuser.
Following the incident, social media posts and news outlets labeled Doe a rapist, leading to student protests and vandalism of the fraternity house in which the University did not intervene, the petition alleges. Doe put particular emphasis on the lack of protective action taken by the University following the media and community’s “open destruction” of his reputation, according to the petition.
Doe appealed his expulsion on the grounds of procedural irregularities and bias, but USC Interim Vice President of Student Affairs Monique Allard denied his appeal.
According to CNS, the University has not been served the petition and is reviewing a copy it received, a representative said in a statement Thursday. Students were not sent this statement.
Last October, the Daily Trojan reported that the University put a fraternity on interim suspension due to reports of drugging and sexual assault. Following these reports, students held protests on the Row, calling to reform the culture surrounding Greek life and sexual assault. The Undergraduate Student Government issued a statement after the suspension expressing its demands for institutional reform and an increase in supportive resources for students.

In Spring 2022, the University discarded a new shared ride model for the USC Lyft Program due to coronavirus concerns. Despite last year’s outpouring of student unease, the USC Lyft Program established the shared ride model Friday, USC Transportation announced in a University-wide email Tuesday. 
Under the new model, students will be required to select the individual shared ride option for rides within the USC Lyft Zone to be covered by the University. Shared rides may use Lyft’s ride-pairing algorithm to pick up other riders based on route, destination and vehicle size, a change from the program in operation for the past three semesters. Students have the option to bring one friend along for safety and security.
Avery Sands, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said she wishes the University had consulted more students before making the decision to require shared rides, especially since it directly impacts their safety.
“Especially if there was already backlash last year, I feel like the school should have had more students involved,” Sands said.
Maria Ruiz, a freshman majoring in law, history and culture, said that the policy changes exacerbate inequality between students of different socioeconomic status.
“Some students might be able to afford their own individual rides,” Ruiz said. “But not everyone has that luxury. And when it concerns safety, that is unacceptable.”
For many students, the Lyft service offers a vital sense of security at night.
“Because Lyft is or has been a way for students to take care of their mental and social health in a safe way and safe environment, the new policy poses a danger toward students, especially since many students run their errands after hours because that’s their schedule as college students,” said Morelia Cadenas, a freshman majoring in public relations. “Maybe a nine o’clock run to the grocery store becomes unsafe and dangerous, which affects our day to day lives.”
Last year, the University’s decision to shift the Lyft program to a shared ride model sparked a backlash among students. In a Change.org petition that garnered more than 3,000 signatures, students expressed concerns that the shared ride model would endanger students traveling in protective pairs, and put them at risk for sexual assault or encourage the spread of the coronavirus between strangers sharing rides.
The Daily Trojan previously reported that students who opposed last year’s policy changes were primarily concerned that the shared ride model would jeopardize their health and safety in favor of frugality, especially since the Lyft program is frequently used when students are at their most vulnerable in the early hours of the morning and after parties.
USC Transportation emphasized in its email that the shared ride model was previously used by various operators, including USC’s former in-house Campus Cruisers program, which provided students with walking or vehicle escorts before being replaced by the Lyft program.
Operating hours for the Lyft program — 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., excluding Game Days — remain the same for both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses.

If I weren’t writing a column on the very subject, I would say I’m at a complete loss for words at the omni-crisis developing in Britain. Nurses, ambulance staff, postal workers and others have been on strike for God knows how long, with the simplest of demands imaginable: higher pay. During a cost-of-living crisis, no less. Dec. 15 in particular saw the largest nursing strike in the history of the National Health Service. Britain is feeling the effects far and wide; with hospitals, especially emergency rooms (A&E, as Brits call it), understaffed, people are finding it increasingly difficult to access basic healthcare services, never mind life-saving treatment. 
Yet still, the man at 10 Downing Street, singularly responsible for addressing the situation, has offered nothing in return. Nay, worse: anti-strike legislation.
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s genius law, unveiled Thursday and set to be formally introduced in Parliament in a few weeks, will enforce “minimum service levels” in certain public sectors and allow employers to sack and sue workers who violate said levels. In short, it’s a threat to make fighting for workers’ rights illegal. 
“I fully believe in the unions’ role in our society and the freedom for them to strike,” Sunak told broadcasters on Friday. “I also believe that that should be balanced with the right of ordinary working people to go about their lives free from significant disruption.” 
Faced with enormous backlash, he went on to reassure the nation, quite reassuringly, that the law was “entirely reasonable.” There’s an unspoken principle which states that good people needn’t explicitly announce that they are good; I have a feeling the same applies here.
As we’ve come to expect in government, the only appropriate reaction to this legislation has been coming from one side of the aisle: Keir Starmer, head of the Labour opposition, immediately pledged to repeal the law were Labour to win the next general election — which is expected to be as soon as next year. Labour indeed looks favored to win, which offers only minor relief; the immediate reality is that people will die if workers’ demands continue to be ignored. If and when they do, their blood will be on Sunak’s hands.
Even worse, he does not care. Sunak refuses to say whether he uses private healthcare, staunchly defending it as “not really relevant” and a matter of “personal choice.” Mind-blowingly privileged words coming from a mind-blowingly privileged person, who can simply afford to bring down public healthcare and blame it on anyone except himself.
I’m particularly concerned with what this means for the rest of us. Here in the U.S., we’ve also witnessed strikes in recent months: 48,000 UC student workers went on a five-week strike starting November, culminating in a pay raise which was, as one student later tweeted, “enough to disqualify us for [government] assistance programs and bump us to the next tax bracket, but not enough to cover” the heightened living costs that forced them to strike in the first place. In December, President Joe Biden signed legislation forcing railroad unions to accept a contract deal which failed to guarantee paid sick days, all to avoid an economically devastating rail strike.
With the Sunak catastrophe now added to this growing list of strikes, it’s becoming clear that workers’ rights are at a crossroads. If the Prime Minister’s threat against a strike of such high caliber — with its concentrated media attention, economic impact and disruption of daily life — were to succeed, I worry for smaller unions that could never dream to be as important. 
The pattern is well-established. A business does what it does best: maximizing profit at the workers’ expense and praying the workers won’t have the guts to stand up for themselves. However, they do in fact have the guts and stand up for themselves. The business then either rushes them into deals that hardly satisfy their demands, or wait until they exhaust themselves. We’ve seen it with the UC strikes; we’ve seen it with the U.S. rail strikes (although I must credit Biden for breaking this pattern by rushing the deal before strikes even happened); and God forbid we see it again in the U.K. Given the sheer length and persistence of the strikes, and continued majority support from the public, however, there is yet hope.
For now, Sunak’s threat has proved fruitless. Union leaders briefly obliged to the PM’s calls for negotiations, at which he then suggested that nurses demonstrate productivity — i.e. just work harder — in return for a one-off payment, the Guardian reported. More backlash ensued, and now more strikes.
“Show talks between Ministers and trade union leaders representing striking staff will backfire on an incompetent, provocative Tory Government when they were nothing more than a poor PR stunt,” spat an editorial posted Monday by the Daily Mirror. 
Let us pray it backfires, and soon.

As USC’s biggest, and perhaps only, resident mega-fan of the Georgia Bulldogs, it is something of a clashing-of-worlds for the 2023 College Football Playoff National Championship, featuring said Bulldogs and the TCU Horned Frogs, to come to sunny Los Angeles. It’s been years since I’ve moved to California, and years since I’ve been back home. A lot of things have changed — like my politics — but one thing has remained a constant: my feverish support for the Dawgs. 
This year’s matchup features two Southern teams, and in the case of the Bulldog fanbase, perhaps the best embodiment of Southern football culture. While USC games are always fun to watch and tailgate for, it doesn’t even begin to compare to game day festivities in the Southeastern Conference. So when it was announced that there would be no tailgating at SoFi stadium leading up to the big game, many fans took to social media sites like Twitter to express their discontent. What gives, Los Angeles?
Initially, I was part of the unsatisfied crowd, even though I literally had no plans to see the game because I have enough resolve to not spend my entire refund check on those tickets. I just like being a part of the mob sometimes. But in the back of my mind, I had reasoned that SoFi and Inglewood rightfully didn’t want any intoxicated Georgia fans (and I guess non-teetotalling TCU fans as well) getting too rambunctious before the game even starts. As it turns out, however, it was the decision of the College Football Playoff committee, a body based in Texas, to ban tailgating — the same stance it took in previous national championship games, including the most recent one in Indianapolis, which the Bulldogs won. 
And yet, like any “controversial” decision to come out of a blue state, conservative politicians jumped all over it, framing it as California’s way of killing the vibe and culture that surrounds college football in the South. One of the biggest names that decided to jump into the dogpile to make something of a culture war out of a molehill was Georgia Governor Brian Kemp. Kemp took to Twitter to roast California for not understanding that “a tailgate with friends & family is the only way to prepare for a big game,” as well as to promise that fans will be able to tailgate when Georgia hosts the National Championship in 2025. That might as well be a political campaign promise, and I’d argue that’s exactly what Kemp wanted it to sound like. 
I do have to point out that tailgates are held at a higher value in the SEC because a considerable number of Southern colleges are still dry, as in they don’t allow the sale of alcoholic beverages inside of their stadiums — unless you have deep pockets and a hankering for overpriced booze: at UGA’s Sanford Stadium, you can indulge in libations if you donate $25,000 over 5 years. The next time you find yourself at the Coliseum watching the Trojan defense learn how to tackle in real-time, just remember your Georgian counterparts can’t buy overpriced hard seltzer in their stadiums like Trojans can. Now you know why Kemp and company are making such a fuss over this fairly minuscule issue.
Football, arguably more than any other sport, is political. If this scuffle shows anything, it is that conservative politicians -— despite their hemming and hawing about how athletes ought to “shut up and play” and despite their own ignorance about local policy in their home state — are more than ready to make the South’s best past-time a proxy for political wars, especially if it can score them a few cheap points with their base, even if their base doesn’t have alumni connections to these college programs. In fact, states with residents who have fewer college degrees tend to be better at college football. 
Kemp isn’t just ragging on California just to rag on them and advocate for the Bulldog fanbase. He and politicians like him know exactly how their generally white base, regardless of college education status, will respond. It’s the same way they’ve responded to other veiled political attempts by conservative politicians to rile them up: blaming it on the politics of far-away liberal places that they view as capable of marginalizing them and their way of living — including the way they engage in athletic entertainment.

Last year was incredibly long. I can’t explain it, but it felt like it was Wednesday for maybe four months straight — in both a good and bad way. But still, it was another fantastic year to be alive: to learn, to love, to meet, to explore, to discover, to hurt and to heal. 
This article marks the official start of my fifth season here at the Daily Trojan, and “That’s Fashion, Sweetie” needs to start with something exciting. I first thought of doing another trend prediction, but I’ve been feeling very drawn to in-and-out lists à la middle school and Lisi Harrison’s “The Clique.”
So, without further ado, here are my 2023 ins and outs.
Starting off strong with my most recent obsession: jewelry. This year will be key to explore jewelry of all colors — and I don’t mean gem colors or dip-dyed chromatic hues. I mean gold, silver and bronze. The year particularly will be huge for silver, bringing a fun shine to the blinding white of sun’s glittery kisses on snow and pink cheeks flushed against peeping veins. I also think that a “drip” concept will be amplified. Not in the droplet fashion, where there’s a clear teardrop shape, but in a molten, melted way with bumps and mumps. Still, what’s on my “in” list is playing around with different jewelry metals. It forces you to be more creative on how to wear both gold and silver or gold and bronze, but it also brings a subtle “umph” to the ensemble.
What is out, though, is sticking to one type of metal. I don’t mean this in a spiteful way – I get it, all jewelry types don’t look good on everyone. Silver looks good on me in the winter but makes me look pale in the summer; gold amplifies my California glow in the summer but makes me look a little orange in my paler forms. It’s like understanding what colors compliment you through color composition and trial and error. But, just giving the mix-and-match a try is enough. You never know, maybe you’ll realize how good rose gold or bronze looks on you. 
Next, ribbons are in. And I mean ribbons in the most “Pearl,” ballet-core, gift-wrapping way. Tie one in your hair, at the end of plaits as bows, add them to your sleeves. With ribbons, it’s all about elevation through subtle addition; it’s not more is more. Here is the distinction: more is more is about maximalism, about adding on and on to compliment and contrast — to argue and quarrel to an eventual, and maybe provocative, resolution. With the ribbons, it’s about strategic placement. See, for example, Shu Shu Tong’s collaboration with Asics. The sneakers have a rubber bow where the laces are, elevating the shoe past a simple sneaker. It takes on a 3D form that will either draw attention toward the shoe, or exist to amplify maybe the sleeves of the outfit or the “recital headband” by Sandy Liang, a headband that has a bow with a long train of ribbon on both ends. 
While I support the “Pearl” bow, I am over pearls. I’ve just had a harder time styling pearls in a way that a) didn’t look like pustules in direct sunlight or b) didn’t look like a micro trend. I think I am also just not old enough to make pearls look elegant. This may be more of a personal beef, but for right now, she’s out in my book. 
On the topic of micro trends, though, what’s in is using them to develop personal style. Use the trends as a way to explore and experiment with new cuts, silhouettes, colors, patterns and textures. This is vastly different from what is out: using micro trends to stay “in.” This year especially may be the rise of core-core. Further explained in HypeBeast’s article “Can 2023 Be the Year of ‘Nothingcore’?” core-core is rejecting the initial usage of “-core,” which gives “stylist blueprints for internet-born microtrends.” Thus, offering the end of distinct trend cycles and aesthetics — which includes capsule wardrobes — which will instead be supplemented by the triumph of personal style. 
Being safe is out. Don’t be uncomfortable, but don’t stay safe: the area where you don’t grow. Trying, therefore, is in, which includes denim on denim, monochromatic matching and amorphous or ambiguous shapes. Experiment with what you have first, and then find ways to amplify one piece or the whole. But be bold and be creative — let your inner child roam free, the one who understood there were endless colors but didn’t know their names were chartreuse or turquoise. Just try. That’s hot. 
Something to consider is the no pants-pants trend. Microshorts à la bloomers and heavy coverage briefs are the way to go, seen most famously on Bella Hadid and Clara Perlmutter (known as @tinyjewishgirl on TikTok). I personally think they’re a really cool addition to the “inner wear as outerwear trend.” Upon further reflection, I don’t understand why it is suddenly extra provocative when it comes to bearing thighs. Corsets are now common, so are slip dresses, but showing a little buttcheek is when all hell breaks loose. Pair them with some leg warmers, frilly socks or under a mini skirt. Either way, microshorts, and the confidence they come with, are in. 
What about your makeup though? Full glam is out — sorry. Part of it is frustration that I could never achieve that Hollywood starlet look that lasts all night, but also because I have been turning toward a more minimalistic approach in the latter half of 2022. So, I’m now officially declaring a sleazy-angel vibe as in. Focused on simple, glowing, dewy skin, the key to this look is about the eyes. Use those siren eyes, baby! 
Focus on cream shadows or highlighters that are white with small specks of glitter, even better if lightly chromatic with hints of blue, purple or green. For the eyes, keep it smokey with grays, silvers, blacks and browns. Kohl is a great product to use to line your eyes, but a popular TikTok trend is to line your eyes with a pencil liner, then wash your face and apply the rest of your makeup. Make sure to give your eyes a break once in a while and clean off the eyeliner thoroughly, though, as buildup can cause blockage of the oil glands in your eyelids that will harm your eye health and tear production. 
Topping off my in and out list, I have to include overall health in mindset, starting out strong with “lucky girl syndrome,” a strong sense of belief and trust that everything will work out for you and in your favor because you are a lucky person, which is not only for the girls, despite the name. But what makes it in is the manifestation and belief that comes with it. To truly believe that you are the luckiest person alive, that the universe is on your side, looking out for you and that life will always go your way does wonders. 
But be careful not to fall into fantasy and delusion because it can block manifestations from turning into reality. Here’s an example: you are manifesting a new wardrobe that is stylish, but you don’t know a lot about fashion or personal style. So, you end up manifesting retail Gucci and Prada campaigns that aren’t even being sold yet. Suddenly, you’re manifesting an entire designer wardrobe for the sake of it being designer, not because it is the next step for you. 
Instead of falling into this fantasy loop of only wanting Jimmy Choos and Hermès Birkins, the true manifestation comes with finding something that catches your eye and is in an ideal price range. Then, reality sets in as you see an Instagram ad of a small boutique or find a grail when thrifting. Delusion is officially in the out category, though; always keep in mind distinction and explicitness, not wild and untamed strings that ball into a tangled mess of confusion and frustration. 
Now you know my 2023 ins and outs, what are yours? Don’t know where to start? Look at your values and reflect on 2022. What do you think you lack? What do you wish to have more of?
Life will never go as smoothly as we plan, no matter how many lists, charts or moodboards we make. Progress isn’t linear either, and we have to learn from our lows in order to reach higher highs. But with the new year bringing in new fortune, possibility and luck, there is no better time to expand your presence and simply try. 
What are you waiting for? Take the world by storm — hopefully in your micro shorts.

The Golden Globes announced its nominees for 2023 on Dec. 12. The nominations included some disappointing, albeit not surprising, decisions such as only nominating men for Best Director. Although the list had some very unfortunate snubs — especially the exclusion of Stephanie Hsu in the Best Actress category for her role as Joy Wang/Jobu Topukai in “Everything Everywhere All at Once” — there were no major surprises. 
An exposé from the Los Angeles Times in 2021 reported that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group in charge of handing out the awards, had no Black members. The group has since inducted 21 new members, six of whom are Black. HFPA originally promised to add 13 Black members to mirror the 13% Black population of the United States. Shaun Harper, the executive director of the USC Race and Equity Center, called the group out for creating a “racist quota” in another L.A. Times story.
Still, the award show, often considered the start of award season, will air on Tuesday night. The decisions the Association chooses to make will certainly stir up debate. Ultimately, only one nominee can win, leaving behind a group of disappointed nominees and viewers whose predictions were completely wrong. Still, predicting will always be the best part of award season. Therefore, here is a list of predictions, or you could call them manifestations, for some major categories this year. 
Best Motion Picture — Drama: “Tár”
Many are counting on Steven Spielberg’s “The Fabelmans” to take the win. However, “Tár” provided 2022 with the “Black Swan”-“Whiplash” energy it was so dearly missing. 
Cate Blanchett delivers in her role as Lydia Tár as only Cate Blanchett can. The movie follows the accomplished classical musician and conductor as her life spirals after allegations of sexual misconduct come to light. An important look into abuses of power in workplaces, “Tár” has a chance to swoop in and take the win. Or at least, that’s the hope. 
Best Picture — Musical or Comedy: “Everything Everywhere All at Once”
Despite Hsu’s snub, “Everything Everywhere All at Once” deserves the award. This category may be the most stacked of them all. Between Palme d’Or winner “Triangle of Sadness” to eight-time-nominated “The Banshees of Inisherin,” the win will not be easy. 
“Everything Everywhere All at Once”  is an ambitious, chaotic and gorgeous film. Directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Schienert, also known as “the Daniels,” created a neverending world for the incredible Michelle Yeoh to explore. The film involves sci-fi, karate, romance, family drama and, of course, comedy — truly placing it in a league of its own. Anyone who has seen the film’s rock scene can vouch that there is no more deserving winner.   
Best Television Series — Musical or Comedy: “Abbott Elementary”
How could “Abbott Elementary” not be the top choice for the best comedy show of the year? Full of chaos and love, “Abbott” is the model to show all comedy can provide to the world. Providing the warming energy of “Schitt’s Creek,” “Abbott” deserves to be rewarded for saving the network sitcom. 
Although, “The Bear” and “Only Murders in the Building” are not at all bad choices for the win. “The Bear” truly is a masterpiece;  it’s innovative and exhausting and critics love it. The star-studded cast of “Only Murders” could also certainly draw attention to the show. 
Best Actress in a Television Series — Musical or Comedy: Quinta Brunson
In an era of television with seemingly endless complicated characters, Janine Teagues from “Abbot” is the lovable goofball the world needs. Brunson provides so much energy and heart to the character; it would feel illegal to root for anyone else. 
With a cast of characters so incredible (looking at Principal Ava), it would be easy for Janine’s character to get lost. Brunson never lets that happen — which is probably due to a combination of her comedic timing and flawless writing (another reason “Abbott” deserves the win for Best Series). 
Best Actor in a Television Series — Musical or Comedy: Bill Hader
Nominated for both previous seasons of “Barry” but leaving empty handed, 2023 feels like Hader’s time to shine. Titular character Barry Berkman, a former Marine, makes his money as a hitman until he finds his love of acting. Throughout the three seasons the show has run, Barry tries to escape his past and his trauma to pursue a career as an actor, but of course, this proves to be an incredibly difficult task. 
Although “Barry” is a comedy, and it is funny, Barry (both the show and character) hold a lot of nuance. Hader does an incredible job in capturing the anti-hero. (So, yes, Hader deserves the win for the exact opposite reason Brunson deserves the win.) It’s truly hard to believe that Stefon and Barry share the same actor. 
Who knows what will happen during Tuesday’s ceremony. Will a fight break out? Will it be a monotonous three hours? (Hopefully not with comedian Jerrod Carmichael set to host.) Will anyone even be watching? 
Well, that’s a debrief for Wednesday morning. More important than any of this, the Association needs to sort itself out before we waste too much time fretting its choices.

Whether you were overwhelmed by the workload of finals or drowning in the holiday season chaos, the new music releases in December may have passed you by. The start of 2023 is the perfect time to listen to new artists or genres. Here are some of the greatest songs and albums you can add to your “walking to class” playlists for the spring semester.  
SZA — “SOS”
Five years after her groundbreaking debut album “Ctrl,” R&B artist SZA surpassed the expectations of her fans with her sophomore album “SOS.” Since its Dec. 9 release, “SOS” has found itself at the number one spot on Billboard’s 200. Remaining at the top now for the third week in a row, the lasting impact of this album is apparent. 
The 23-track creation not only set streaming records but also captured the attention of her audience through candid storytelling and soulful melodies. SZA collaborated with artists such as Don Toliver, Phoebe Bridgers, Travis Scott and Ol’ Dirty Bastard. With over 675 million streams on Spotify, “Good Days,” released as a single in 2020, is the most listened to song on the album. The soulful tone of SZA’s voice flawlessly communicates themes of yearning and self contempt in ballads such as “Special” and “Nobody Gets Me.” Another great song on the album comes from the catchy chorus and rhythmic tempo of “Kill Bill.” 
“SOS” comprises a variety of melodies and styles which sublimely blend together to create an album with songs as aesthetically pleasing as the cover art. Despite heavy subject matter, SZA navigated the production of each song to transcend the pain it was expressing through masterfully constructed melodies.
Weezer — “SZNZ: Winter”
On the first day of winter, Weezer added seven new songs to their year-long album “SZNZ.” Every season of 2022, Weezer released a new leg of the album making the most recent winter songs the fourth and final installment.    
This final segment, appropriately titled “SZNZ: Winter”, had a somber mood of solitude. The lyrics were riddled with regret driven by the realization of past mistakes. Each of the seven songs follow this theme of loneliness and search for companionship after failed relationships. 
The first and most popular track of this installment is the song “I Want A Dog.” With simple lyrics and bare acoustics this song is the musical manifestation of the naked tree branches of winter. Another notable song off this album, entitled “Dark Enough to See the Stars,” has a whimsical intro fortified by the grit of electric guitars. As the song progresses, the delivery of lyrics amplifies, signifying a crisis that intensifies over time.  
The other five songs “Iambic Pentameter,” “Basketball,” “Sheraton Commander,” “The One That Got Away” and “The Deep and Dreamless Sleep” fall between the lines of Weezer’s alternative rock style that coherently fit to create this final installment. 
Old Dominion — “Memory Lane”
Country band Old Dominion released the single “Memory Lane” to open their 2023 discography. The band, who first made a name for themselves in 2007, has had seven number 1 singles on country radio. With almost a million streams in the first week of its release, “Memory Lane” may be following in the successful footsteps of Old Dominion’s past singles. 
This single fits in the genre of country but has elements of pop music in the underlying beat. The song begins with a simple stand alone guitar strum and opening vocals from lead singer Matthew Ramsey. The lyrics of “Memory Lane” are driven by the nostalgia of a past relationship and the bittersweet treasure chest that are the memories. “If I could buy a house on Memory Lane / I would have to wonder if you miss me the same,” Ramsey sings. Old Dominion shows that the simple concept of reminiscing on the past is one which many can relate to. 
Ñengo Flow, Bad Bunny — “Gato De Noche”
Puerto Rican powerhouses Ñengo Flow and Bad Bunny collaborated on the song “Gato De Noche.” Released Dec. 22, this song already has almost 50 million streams on Spotify. Both artists have found success in songs constructed of witty lyrics and a signature reggaeton trap beat. “Gato De Noche” follows this same formula and is reminiscent of their past music. 
If you are a fan of Bad Bunny’s recent album “Un Verano Sin Ti,” this would be a good song to listen to. This collaboration, while unexpected, is the perfect amalgamation of two voices on the reggaeton urban music scene. Whether or not the listener understands Spanish, the rhythm and production style make “Gato De Noche” an undeniably captivating track.

Last fall, a good friend of mine referred me to the books and life of Eve Babitz, perhaps inadvertently due to our similarities (blonde, well-endowed writers). Babitz was an artist, a writer and an icon, often notorious for the famous men with which she had affairs. While she may have been known, but not quite famous, for her glamorous, promiscuous, party girl lifestyle, Babitz had a late-in-life rise to widespread fame for her books, one that can be properly attributed to Vanity Fair writer Lili Anolik. 
Anolik wrote a profile on Babitz in 2014. Babitz, after an accident involving a long gauze skirt and a dropped cigarette that left more than half of her body covered in third degree burns, had transformed into a recluse. Yet Anolik’s profile brought Babitz’s books about glamorous 1960s Los Angeles back to life, into mainstream publication and distribution. People loved her books for one reason or another; my wild guess being that it’s likely due to the deep feelings of nostalgia we feel for a simpler time — one not so dominated by pervasive 24 hour news cycles, endless attractive people on our screens and gloom and despair.  
However, the books we now regard with awe were scrutinized at the time of publishing. Babitz’s books were out of print, scorned for their details of an unapologetic life of absolute hedonism, and Babitz written off as a party girl, not to be taken seriously in the literary profession. Babitz recognized the way she lived her life. Yet, she cared not to do anything that wasn’t exactly what she wanted to do. She lived her life for herself and herself only and refused to let anyone get in her way. 
Solace can be found with a writer like Joan Didion, whose writings properly analyze many phenomena that dredged and continue to drag down society. However, escapism can be found through Eve Babitz, someone who brings about the party and lives only to have a good time.
This was something even Babitz recognized at the time, with an acknowledgment in her eight-page-long list of dedications at the beginning of Eve’s Hollywood to fellow Los Angeles writer Didion: “ to the Didion-Dunnes for having to be who I’m not.” Babitz chronicled the parties, ones she often was the center of. She wrote earnestly yet lovingly of the hedonist Los Angeles lifestyle of the ‘60s and ‘70s, knowledgeable of her writing power and prowess, no matter how many no’s or criticisms she received. 
Over winter break, I began reading “Naked Lunch,” William S. Burrough’s critically acclaimed novel following the life of a heroin junkie told in a series of vignettes. I refrained from finishing it due to the non-linear plot that drove me near insane. However, a line that stuck with me was “pleasure is relief from tension.” The line was used to contextualize heroin as removing all pleasure, tension or sensation of anything. 
This line rings true, in everything from sexual release to a massage rubbing a knot in one’s back to eating a delicious meal. Even day-to-day, minute pleasures are the result of a dissolution of tensions. It seems that we walk around with so much built up tension, anxiety and stress, that we deny ourselves the ability of pleasure, of release. We convince ourselves so deeply of our discomfort and unease with ourselves and the world that sometimes we feel empty without it. 
Confidence is barraged with jealous daggers, the good life with envy and jealousy. Yet we are completely rapt as a society with hedonism, with figures from Eve Babitz to the Kardashians to rising influencer Alix Earle, who perform lives of exorbitant and pleasurable activities. Yet when it comes down to ourselves, there is too often a sense of guilt for taking time to enjoy things. 
For an individualistic society we strangely don’t often prioritize ourselves in the way that Babitz does. Self-indulgence is only a problem when it is at the risk of others. Let’s stop pretending it’s such a terrible thing to eat a platter of animal style fries, to indulge in materialistic desires, and to overindulge in substances from time to time — to give in to guilty pleasures of any and every kind. 
Hedonism is alive and well, for those who allow themselves to indulge in behaviors of excess and pure euphoria. Yet we as a society have deemed it, at worst, degenerate, and at best, unattainable. However, we all perhaps could be a little better if we allowed ourselves little pleasures, to release tension bit by bit. Our framing of the world and the way we choose to see it has massive implications and controls the amount of joy we can find in our lives. If we lead with love, care and compassion, shouldn’t we all be allowed to have a good time?

As the impacts of climate change continue to affect Earth — from increasingly frequent and severe extreme weather events to rising sea levels — corporations and influential individuals are implementing sustainability efforts into their agendas, though large corporations remain some of the chief culprits for high greenhouse gas emissions. 
Research from Governance & Accountability Institute Inc. found more than 90% of S&P 500 companies published sustainability reports in 2020. USC, too, has adopted sustainability initiatives, such as the USC Sustainability Data Hub, which provides the University community with reports regarding sustainable practices. 
To analyze the University’s tie to corporate sustainability efforts and downfalls, the Daily Trojan compiled data about members of the Board of Trustees, many of whom hold leadership positions at large companies. This article intends to study whether Trustees’ political donations and company initiatives align with the University’s sustainability goals. 
The Board of Trustees is composed of 34 members assigned to uphold the University’s interests and act as the “ultimate decision-making body” according to University policy. The Trustees include leaders from a variety of industries — such as communications, entertainment and biopharmaceuticals — to serve the University. For the purpose of this article, the Daily Trojan delved into Trustee-led companies to spotlight their contributions to the fight against climate change or their negative environmental impacts. 
Many members from the Board of Trustees make monetary donations to politically-affiliated organizations or individuals, which may assist in the development of certain political agendas, as elected officials have the ability to affect legislation for constituents. 
It is unclear whether Trustees considered a candidate’s stance on climate change when making donations; therefore, donations may not reflect Trustees’ stances on the issue. This article is intended to inform the University community about Trustee political donations, and is not intended to be an attack on Trustees or the University as a whole.
Methodology
The Daily Trojan compiled public political donations data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics and Open Secrets. Only significant donations — those above $15,000 — were considered for the purpose of this story, so the data presented do not encompass the whole of Trustees’ political expenditures. Only donations made to winning campaigns were included — with exceptions made in cases where donations to losing campaigns were among the largest for the donor. 
Candidates and political campaigns were then considered in terms of their support for climate change mitigation policies and acknowledgement of anthropogenic climate change as a serious threat. 
This investigation also examined the climate impact of the companies in which Trustees hold executive positions, as well as climate- and sustainability-related policies they have adopted. 
The Daily Trojan used publicly accessible Environmental and Social Governance reports from the corporations that publish them to understand the companies’ environmental impact and policies. Smaller companies that Trustees lead often do not have public ESG reports, so information from the companies’ websites and external ESG ranking sites were used when available. The environmental impact of companies that retired Trustees used to work for was not considered.
Analysis

According to a 2021 survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, only 10% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents call addressing climate change a top concern, compared to 49% of Democrats and Democratic leaners.
Chair, co-CEO and co-founder of Salesforce Marc Benioff has been a member of the Board since 2011 and is also a member of the USC Marshall School of Business Board of Councilors. 
Benioff has donated $56,400 to California Governor Gavin Newsom, who in 2022 announced the California Climate Commitment, which aims to cut air pollution by 60% and reduce state oil consumption by 91% over the next two decades. Benioff donated $21,200 to former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who continues to promote state and local clean energy efforts through the work of the Schwarzenegger Institute at USC. 
Benioff also donated $20,000 to the Republican Party of California and $54,400 to former California Governor Edmund Brown Jr., who in 2016 signed SD 1383, which established tough restrictions on destructive super pollutants. 
Salesforce, a cloud-based software company, boasts of net zero residual emissions, 100% renewable energy in its operations and a goal to grow one trillion trees on its company site. The company aims to reduce absolute Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions by 50% by 2030. 
Corii D. Berg, a member of the Board since 2020, serves as the executive vice president of Lionsgate Entertainment. There are no significant listed donations for Berg and no publicly accessible ESG report for Lionsgate Entertainment.

Bohnett has donated $92,400 to other politicians — David Cicilline, Andrew Cuomo and Gray Davis — who recognize the threat posed by climate change and pollution. 
A member of the Board since 2014, Robert A. Bradway is the CEO of Amgen, a multinational biopharmaceutical company. Amgen is rated at 21.9 ESG risk by Morningstar Sustainalytics, with 40+ being severe risk and zero to 10 being the lowest risk. The company aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions in its operations by 2027, with renewable energy providing 79% of the company’s total electricity consumption in 2021 — up from 2020’s 41%. Amgen raised $750 million to support its sustainability goals through its first ever “green bond” issued in 2022.
Bradway has donated $409,700 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

According to Caruso’s company website, all new developments are in strict accordance with the latest California Green Building Standards Code.
Caruso’s mayoral campaign put forth a climate plan that included an acceleration of the Department of Water and Power’s renewable and clean energy programs, an initiative for water conservation and growth of the city’s public transportation system. The L.A. Times criticized Caruso in May 2022 over his lack of a specific climate plan, writing that he failed to elaborate on issues such as closing down L.A.’s gas-fired power plants and prohibiting gas hookups in new housing.
David Dornsife, chairman of the board of the Herrick Corporation — a steel corporation with factories in Stockton, Calif., San Bernardino, Texas, Mississippi and Thailand —, has been a member of the USC Board of Trustees since 2002. 
Dornsife donated $19,000 to Pete Sessions (TX-17), who the League of Conservative Voters gave a 3% lifetime score for his support of national environmental policies — 100% being the most support. In 2021, Sessions voted ‘NO’ on the Build Back Better Act, which would invest $555 billion in climate, clean energy jobs and environmental justice. 
Dornsife has also donated $16,000 to Lynne Leach, a former California State Assemblywoman who did not have a public stance on climate change mitigation. 
There is no publicly available ESG report for the Herrick Corporation, but the company’s website writes that “Herrick deploys the best management practices available in our storm water pollution prevention plans and maintains a fleet of construction equipment that far exceeds emissions standards established by the Environmental Protection Agency and California Air Resources Board.”

The firm aims to reduce their carbon footprint by 20% by 2024, and is the first firm to grant billable hour credits to attorneys for non-legal work related to sustainability.
Reed Smith’s lobbying clients, however, include ExxonMobil and Dominion Energy. Morningstar Sustainalytics, a firm providing ESG research, gave the former an ESG rating of 36.45, while the latter has a rating of 25.4. These are considered high and medium risk, respectively. Law Students for Climate Accountability, a movement focused on “pushing the legal industry to phase out fossil fuel representation” gave Reed Smith a “C” rating on its latest Law Firm Climate Change Scorecard.
Co-President of the W.M. Keck Foundation Steve Keck has been a member of the Board since 2021. He donated $19,600 to the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2017.
In 2019, the carbon footprint of the W.M. Keck Observatory was estimated at 3.0 tons of CO2 per science night. The Observatory aims to reduce the figure to net zero over the next decade by decarbonizing its vehicle fleet and aviation footprint, among other measures.
The W.M. Keck Foundation also granted $1.6 million to the University of Maine to fund climate change research in 2008 and $1 million to a Duke University research team working on improving energy conversion processes, which may make higher efficiency solar energy conversion systems possible.

All of Kennedy Wilson Holdings’ European assets exceed the current minimums to comply with Energy Performance Certificates, a rating scheme that summarizes a building’s energy efficiency. Eighteen percent of their assets have an “A” rating, while 47% have a “B” and 23% have a “C.” All of its directly managed electricity contract tariffs are from renewable sources. Kennedy Wilson Holdings has a 18.1 ESG risk rating, which is considered low.

Concluding thoughts
Climate change is an issue that should be dealt with by governments and corporations worldwide. While California has made climate change a top priority, our investigation shows the organizations Board members lead do not necessarily consider it so. Organizations such as Salesforce, Amgen, the W.M. Keck Foundation and United Airlines have clear sustainability initiatives. Others, such as Lionsgate Entertainment, Praisidio, EnerG-ID and West Bank do not have publicly accessible environmental efforts. 
Board Members have donated $614,300 to politicians working on sustainability initiatives and $432,100 to politicians who do not think climate action is a priority.
The University’s leaders should be held accountable for the environmental impacts of the companies they hold executive positions in and the actions of politicians they spend their money on. 
Correction: This article was updated at 3:50 p.m. on Feb. 11 to reflect that East West Bank does have a public ESG report. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.
