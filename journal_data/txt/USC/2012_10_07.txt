Another weekend turned in two dominant performances from the USC women’s volleyball team, which defeated Arizona and Arizona State at the Galen Center this weekend to boost the team’s record to 16-2.
The No. 5 Women of Troy downed the Wildcats 3-0 Friday night before a 3-1 victory over the Sun Devils on Sunday afternoon. Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio continued her torrid pace this season, notching 22 kills Friday before setting a new season high with 24 against Arizona State.
“We were really focused today,” junior libero Natalie Hagglund said. “We had a lot of confidence that we didn’t have in the Oregon match, and confidence is huge for our team.”
The first set Sunday was tight for the Women of Troy, who were locked into a 6-6 tie before a tandem block by sophomore setter Hayley Crone and freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms broke the draw. Bricio stopped back-to-back Sun Devil rallies with kills to extend the lead to 12-7. Crone set up senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller for a kill after an exciting rally to stretch the margin to 14-8 putting a comeback out of reach for the Arizona State.
A kill by junior outside hitter Sara Shaw put the Women of Troy up 22-13, after which a Fuller kill sealed the first set for USC 25-17. The defense was critical to the team’s success in the first set, holding the Sun Devils to only 10 kills on an attacking percentage of .093.
“Our blockers were really doing their job today,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “They were funneling balls in to Natalie’s area, and she’s one of the best at digging balls out.”
The second frame mirrored the first, this time with Arizona State taking a lead 6-5 on an apparent error by the referees before a Fuller kill knotted things up at 6-6. Shaw followed an Ogoms kill with a block to put the Women of Troy up 9-8, their first lead of the set. The set remained tightly contested but the Sun Devils improved their hitting, taking a 15-12 lead. A couple of errors drew the Women of Troy to within 22-20, but an Arizona State service ace gave the Sun Devils match point. The Women of Troy notched three consecutive points to narrow the gap, but the Sun Devils terminated the rally and took the second set 25-23. USC struggled with its hitting, attacking at a clip of .111 after a .275 mark in the first set.
The third set featured a stronger attack from the Sun Devils, who took advantage of USC’s errors to record an early 9-7 lead. The Women of Troy rattled off three straight points, with an Ogoms kill and a Crone service ace pushing USC up 11-9. Back-to-back kills by Bricio and junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard extended the lead to 15-13. The Sun Devils chipped away at the lead and narrowed the gap to 21-18, but Shaw terminated the rally to seal the set for the Women of Troy.
Shaw opened the fourth frame strong for the Women of Troy, notching a kill and a block to stake the Women of Troy to a 7-4 lead. The Women of Troy had a tough time putting the set away, though, as the Sun Devils closed the gap to 18-17. Shaw set up match point with a kill before an Arizona State attacking error sealed it for the Women of Troy.
“We stayed patient in the third and fourth sets, and I think that’s what got us the wins,” Olgard said. “Patience and confidence really helped in getting us the win.”
The win followed an impressive outing Friday, in which the Women of Troy handled the Wildcats 3-0 (25-17, 25-16, 25-21). Bricio was dominant for the Women of Troy, notching a then-season-high 22 kills to go along with a .475 attack clip.
The win also marked number 300 for Haley’s USC career. The coach has now recorded 300 wins each for three schools. Looking forward, Haley stressed the need to remain confident.
“It’s going to be the hardest trip, going to the Bay Area. Stanford is always very difficult to beat on their home court,” Haley said. “They’re starting a lot of freshmen too, so it’s going to be a good matchup for us to see how we do.”
The Women of Troy will face off against the Cardinal on Wednesday night before a Friday night match against California.

The USC women’s soccer team has started off conference play with five overtime games in a row, and it seems as though the extra time is starting to take its toll.
Instant offense · Junior midfielder Jordan Marada, a transfer from Saint Mary’s College, has made an immediate impact for USC. Starting in all 13 games, Marada leads the Women of Troy with five assists. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (4-6-3, 0-4-1) tied Oregon State 1-1 on Friday before losing to Oregon in double-overtime on Sunday 1-0, running the squad’s winless streak to four matches.
Junior midfielder Elizabeth Eddy, last season’s leading scorer, and junior midfielder Haley Boysen both suffered concussions during Friday’s match at Oregon State and missed Sunday’s game against Oregon. The team also lost sophomore defender Alex Quincey to a leg injury last weekend.
“We were missing some key players today,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said following Sunday’s loss. “When you’re missing three players that normally start, you have to make some adjustments … I thought they played pretty well considering the circumstances.”
Freshman forward Whitney Pitalo, sophomore defender Hannah Moehling and sophomore midfielder Elizabeth Caparis all saw more time on the field than usual on Sunday to offset the personnel losses.
Sophomore goalkeeper Caroline Stanley gave credit to the girls that received more playing time.
“We’ve been installing different formations and counting on different players to perform different roles,” Stanley said. “The girls that stepped up off the bench did an excellent job.”
The Ducks (6-6-2, 1-3-1) earned their first conference win by pressuring USC’s back line from the start, outshooting the Women of Troy 9-4 in the first half.
USC’s defense, buoyed by Stanley’s nine saves, held strong through regulation. But the Women of Troy struggled to create chances of their own: The team managed only three shots on goal the entire game, and didn’t take any corner kicks.
In overtime, a shot from Oregon’s Kira Wagoner hit off the crossbar and bounced to her teammate Kristen Parr, who knocked in the golden goal in the 96th minute to claim victory for the Ducks.
“[Parr] got an early Christmas present with that rebound,” Stanley said. “It was unlucky for us, but we have to eliminate those shots.”
The loss made for a sour end to a weekend that started off with a hard-fought tie against Oregon State (9-4-1, 1-3-1).
USC came out of the locker room on the offensive, outshooting the Beavers 13-6 and generating six corner kicks in the first half.
The Women of Troy finally drew first blood in the 71st minute, when freshman forward Jamie Fink cut to her right on the left side of the pitch just outside of the box and tucked in an unassisted goal that bounced off the right post.
But less than three minutes later, the Women of Troy gave their lead away on an own goal from freshman defender Marlee Carrillo.
“We didn’t do a good job of marking the opposing player that ran in the box to get a cross,” Khosroshahin said. “So on the cross, Marlee tried to swipe it away and it just didn’t work out.”
The score would stay even through the last 17 minutes of regulation and two 10-minute overtime periods.
Despite the disappointing results of their second consecutive weekend road trip, Stanley found some positives for the team to build on.
“This weekend, our defense was the most organized it’s been all season,” Stanley said. “I feel like everybody supported each other this weekend … [But] obviously it’s a little disheartening going to overtime so many times and not getting the results you want.”
USC plays its last road game of the season Friday at Washington State at 1 p.m. before ending the regular season with five straight home games.

For about four minutes last Thursday night, the then-No. 13 Trojans looked like they were in trouble.
They turned the ball over twice in their first two possessions, leading to a pair of Utah touchdowns. With 12:15 left in the first quarter, USC was already down 14-0.
Was USC coach Lane Kiffin going to be the victim of another tough road loss? Was senior quarterback Matt Barkley going to display that supposed lack of poise that plagued him in this season’s loss to Stanford?
The answer was a definitive “no.”
Barkley and the Trojans weathered the storm. They remained cool and collected on the sidelines.
Ask anyone who was at the game if they could find a look of distress on any of the Trojans’ faces. I guarantee that no one — not even senior center Khaled Holmes, who botched the snaps that led to Utah’s first 14 points — had any doubt.
I don’t believe the Trojans ever thought they were going to lose that game. Even when they were down 21-10, with the Utes’ student section at its loudest and the analysts preparing to dig USC’s Bowl Championship Series grave, the Trojans did not waver or appear the least bit concerned.
Never before had a two-touchdown deficit seemed so insignificant.
The tides began to turn on the first possession of the second quarter, when Barkley hit junior wide receiver Robert Woods across the middle on a crossing pattern. Woods made a few cuts and gained 41 yards.
A few plays later, USC notched the first of its many touchdowns of the game; it was a moment when every Utah fan fell silent.
Later, Barkley hit sophomore tight end Randall Telfer in the end zone on a fade route. Telfer caught the ball with one hand, making it look effortless. USC had reduced the gap, 21-17.
At that moment, even though they were still down, the game was over. USC was going to score as many points as it wanted, and there wasn’t going to be anything Utah could do.
I don’t think I’ve ever heard a louder crowd go so quiet in a three-second span as when Telfer caught that pass. All the energy the Utah faithful had when they went up by 14 was sucked out of the stadium.
For all of the criticism Barkley took for losing his composure in Palo Alto, he showed the opposite traits in this contest. He looked like the savvy veteran we all expect him to be after starting for three-plus seasons. He completed 23 of his 30 passes, threw no interceptions and made big plays when the team was down. He threw that momentum-changing pass to Telfer, converted big third downs and, of course, threw that 83-yard bomb to sophomore receiver Marqise Lee to give the Trojans a 31-21 lead. But Barkley wasn’t the only one who showed resiliency Thursday night.
Holmes, a team captain, rallied the offensive line, which was dominated by Utah’s defensive lineman Star Lotulelei during the opening part of the game.
Bad snaps and all, Holmes stayed composed and shut down Lotulelei to the point that his name wasn’t called after the first period. Holmes led a line that paved the way for 129 rushing yards and 303 passing yards on the day. They didn’t give up any sacks, either. It was a dominating performance by a unit that was heavily criticized after the Stanford loss. Unprompted by anyone, Holmes even apologized for his errors to his teammates after the game.
And then there was the defense.
The defense, which was put in terrible positions its first couple of times on the field, never caved. The unit did not blame its offense for its ineptitude or lack of ball security. Instead, they remained focused. It was the defense, led by junior cornerback Nickell Robey, which gave the Trojans their final score on the day — an interception return for a touchdown. The defense forced fumbles, put pressure on Utah quarterback Jon Hays and never hung their heads, despite the early deficit. They knew they were going to win, too.
For all of the bad things that could have happened during the game, the Trojans refused to let negative circumstances get the best of them. They did not play outside themselves and did not try to make plays where there weren’t any. They remained confident. The Trojans knew they were the better team; it was just a matter of making the scoreboard acknowledge it, too.
The victory against Utah taught me a lot about this USC squad. It’s a team that knows what it can do on both sides of the ball. It’s a team that remains confident despite things not always going their way. But most of all, the 2012 Trojans expect to win, even when the chips are down. There were no scared looks and no yelling among teammates. There was no desperation. There was only confidence. And as long as Barkley, Holmes and the defense retain their swagger, this team will be a force to be reckoned with come November and bowl season.
No 14-point deficits will ever change that.

For the second time in less than a month, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team traveled to Palo Alto and returned home with a victory.
Added boost · Senior driver Tobias Preuss’ recent return from injury further strengthens an already-potent USC attack. Preuss scored his first three goals of the season against Stanford on Saturday. – Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
In a nationally televised match on the Pac-12 Network on Saturday morning, the Trojans (15-0, 2-0) used a third-period surge to defeat No. 5 Stanford (6-3, 0-1) by a score of 9-6.
Senior driver Tobias Preuss, in his second week back after missing five weeks to injury, notched his first three goals of the season to lead the Trojans. Junior driver Nikola Vavic contributed two goals.
“This is a huge confidence booster for us,” Preuss said. “The atmosphere was like the NCAA’s, and it showed us that we are the best team in the nation. If we can continue to execute our game plan, it’ll be hard for any team to come close to us.”
A Berlin native and member of the German national team, Preuss had 16 goals for the Trojans last year and was named an All-America Honorable Mention. Prior to that, Preuss scored 29 goals for the Trojans’ 2010 national championship team. Preuss’ breakout performance Saturday made an already potent offensive attack even more difficult to stop.
In their previous matchup in September, the Trojans needed overtime to edge the Cardinal. This time around, the swarming Trojan defense limited Stanford to just four goals through the first three periods. USC never led by fewer than three goals during the final period.
“We pressed them hard in the first few possessions, countered them out and pushed Stanford to have to take shots outside of where they’re used to attacking,” Preuss said.
In the third quarter, junior utility Mace Rapsey made it 6-4 just 21 seconds after the Cardinal pulled to within one goal, and goals from senior driver Michael Rosenthal and Preuss put the Trojans up 8-4 by the end of the third period.
The flurry of goals in the third quarter highlighted one of the best periods the Trojans have played all season and showed their improvement in capitalizing on offensive chances, not letting  scoring opportunities go by the wayside.
“We knew their goalie was weak on lateral movement, so we didn’t just take the first open shot we had,” senior two-meter Matt Burton said. “We were patient with our offense and made the right passes. What really sets us apart is how great of shape our guys are in. Teams get tired in the second half, but as the game progresses, we get faster. Stanford’s six starters played most of the first half, and we tired them out then in order to put us in really, really good shape for the second half.”
The Trojans are the top-scoring team in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, and their offensive prowess made life difficult all day for Stanford goalie Scott Platshon. Though he made 16 saves, Platshon, in his first year as full-time starter, had to be on full alert all day against the calculated Trojan attack.
Junior James Clark received the start in goal and made nine saves for the Trojans. After playing in the Olympics on the Australian national team and arriving late to USC as a result, Clark is receiving more playing time in goal as the season progresses.
Sophomore Ely Bonilla primarily manned the goal for the first third of the season, but now Clark and Bonilla form a two-headed monster.
“My hat goes off to James Clark,” Preuss said. “It’s really great that we have two great goalies to throw out there.”
Stanford scored to open the final period, but Preuss completed his hat trick soon after to make it 9-5. The four-goal deficit proved too much for the Cardinal to overcome.
“We won the game because we controlled possession,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Our biggest improvement was in our counterattack. We took the shots their goalie gave us, and Toby [Preuss] was the difference-maker by scoring two huge goals in the third quarter.”

The USC Veterans Association hosted a barbecue Saturday in McCarthy Quad, where student veterans chatted with USC senior  quarterback Matt Barkley and went on an exclusive tour through the new John McKay Athletic Center.
USC students and alumni from all branches and ranks of the armed forces enjoyed an afternoon of food, music and games in celebrating their shared experiences as veterans and Trojans.

This was the group’s first on-campus barbecue.
USC Veterans Association President Joshua Jacobs said the purpose of the event was to advance the group’s broader goals:  community-building and networking.
“We focus on fostering an internal community among USC veterans and ensuring that good jobs are in place for them,” Jacobs said. “Members know that they have a home here and that they can pursue career paths after the military.”
According to Jacobs, there are 500 veterans currently enrolled as students at USC. The USC Veterans Association has grown significantly over the past four years, from about five original members to approximately 100 members.  The organization relies solely on donations from alumni.
Barkley attended the event to thank the association’s members for their service. At his high school alma mater, Mater Dei, Barkley joined his parents in their “Monarchs for Marines” campaign, which focused on supporting military families through the renovation of youth areas near Marine Corps Base at Camp Pendleton. Barkley’s grandfather served in the Navy and Barkley addressed the USC veterans as his “heroes.”
“The servicemen hold a special place in my heart,” Barkley said. “I’ve had respect for [them] since I was a kid. This is a great opportunity for me to thank the Trojans as well as the veterans who served our country so diligently.”
Attendee and veteran Vijay Maisuria, who earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration and corporate finance and is currently a graduate student at the Leventhal School of Accounting, said he enjoyed seeing Barkley at the event.
“As veterans we share a certain brotherhood and sisterhood, but we’re also members of the Trojan Family,” Maisuria said. “It’s an amazing feeling to know that Barkley supports our exclusive group.”
USC center Khaled Holmes, whose grandfather served in World War II, also joined Barkley at the event. The two signed autographs and conversed with guests.
“I have tremendous respect for the veterans of the military,” Holmes said. “I’m here to say thanks for all that they do.”
The USC Veterans Association officially formed in October 2008. Jacobs said the group aims to provide veterans transitioning into USC with networking opportunities and a sense of belonging.
“Coming from different backgrounds and experiences, veterans often have trouble when they are thrown back into school and must manage their finances, live in a new environment and perform academically,” Jacobs said.
USC Veterans Association Treasurer David Kim said though veterans are known to be “lone wolves,” he recognizes the importance of connecting with peers. Kim said the association promotes pride among student veterans and encourages them to find a common voice.
“The Veterans Association seeks to provide support for the personal and school-related issues of its USC members,” Kim said.
The group’s other events include general meetings, community service projects and social events like tailgates and family-oriented outings in Los Angeles. The association’s leaders hope to continue their commitment to social companionship and professional and academic leverage.
“We are pushing to have a veterans resource center built on campus to give returning soldiers a place to go for help and connections,” Jacobs said.
Keith Williams, USC Veterans Association vice president, also said the group’s short-term goals include attracting consistent membership, fundraising and furthering networking efforts on campus and in the community.
Jacobs said the association exemplifies the university’s commitment to serving the country, noting that USC has never eliminated its ROTC program.
“As long as we’re respectful, tactful and passionate, the Trojan Family wants us to succeed,” Jacobs said. “If its students succeed, the school succeeds. It’s a symbiotic relationship.”

Eleven miles of carpool lanes will open on Nov. 11 to solo drivers willing to pay a toll on the I-110 Harbor Freeway. Though the project seeks to make commuting easier, some students said they don’t think the toll lanes will be helpful.
Dubbed Metro ExpressLanes, the project aims to reduce traffic congestion in the L.A. area. The price of the toll ranges from 25 cents to $1.40 per mile, depending on traffic levels.
The cost will be highest during rush hour, when the most vehicles are on the road. Electronic signs will display the current cost so drivers can decide if they want to enter the lane and pay.
To use the ExpressLanes, all drivers must purchase a transponder. The transponder has different settings for the number of people in the car. As a result, only people whose transponders are programmed for a solo driver are charged the toll while driving in the ExpressLane.
Transponders will cost $40 for drivers, except for those registered with AAA who will receive an $8 discount.
The ExpressLanes are part of a $290 million project funded largely by a congestion reduction demonstration grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation.
“This will go a long way in terms of reducing congestion along Harbor Freeway,” said Rick Jager, Metro’s communications manager.
No new lanes are being built, but the system is expected to decrease overall traffic. As some solo drivers move into the current carpool lanes, more space will open in the mixed-flow lanes.
“The idea behind the lanes is to try to better manage the infrastructure currently in place,” Jager said.
Despite their advantages, the toll lanes can be pricey. Traveling all 11 miles during rush hour would cost over $15. Though Metro does have discounts available to lower-income drivers, no such program exists for students.
Undergraduate Student Government Commuter Senator Adam Prohoroff, a senior majoring in accounting, explained that this is the trouble with the ExpressLanes.
“Many current commuter students can’t afford to live on campus, so they would be financially unable to use the new lanes,” he said.
Prohoroff acknowledged that the lanes could be advantageous to students who carpool or use the Metro Vanpool Program, but generally believes that most students will not utilize the ExpressLanes.
Pradeep Nadeswaran, a freshman majoring in biology who said he often drives home on the weekends mirrored Prohoroff’s sentiments.
“I’d rather just plan a little extra time into my schedule and go through the traffic [than pay the toll],” Nadeswaran said.
Prohoroff also said he felt it was unfair that some students should be stuck in traffic because they cannot afford extra fees.
“The lanes put pressure on commuter students,” he said. “Ideally, everyone should look into alternative transit.”
Prohoroff said the average commuter student could save $3,000 per year if they took the Metrolink instead of driving.
Jager, however, said the ExpressLanes project is “trying to change commuter behavior by encouraging people to join carpools or take public transit.” Part of the money from the grant was used to purchase 59 additional clean fuel buses and to add 100 vanpools to the routes.
“When solo drivers begin to travel on the 110 ExpressLanes, all commuters will benefit — whether they pay a toll or not — because the ExpressLanes will redistribute traffic across all lanes of the 110 freeway,” said L.A. County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas in a press release.
The shift of drivers will not impact carpool lanes because they currently have a very large capacity, according to the press release.
The project also provides incentives to take public transit. Transit riders will be credited five dollars toward ExpressLane tolls if they ride the bus 32 times. Carpoolers and vanpoolers are also rewarded for using the ExpressLanes, as they are entered into a drawing for free gas cards every month.

Having a conversation could soon be among the list of available features for a new car.
USC researchers showcased Nigel, the driver-tracking Mini Cooper equipped with 230 sensors and an iPhone app that documents the driver’s habits in its vehicle log, at the sixth annual Body Computing Conference on Friday.
Created in 2010, Nigel emerged from a partnership between automobile company BMW and the USC School of Cinematic Arts to create a car with “character” and personality through ambience storytelling that also monitors the health of the driver.
“We are using the data generated by the car and the driver, looking at driver habits, combination of sensors we know that the drivers are using, and creating an experience around that data,” said Jen Stein, an SCA researcher who oversaw Nigel’s development. “We’ve developed a character that has emerged out of that data. There’s an I-drive display in the center of the car, and once you plug your iPhone in and launch the Lifelog app, we can collect all the data.”
Though still in its early stages, the concept of “health” car will build on the foundation of storytelling already developed with Nigel.
The elements of interaction go beyond GPS directions and reminders to visit the gas station.
“Nigel observes your driving behavior, responses — it can actually count the number of times you triggered the sensors and develop different milestones that you’ve reached with the car like hitting x number of miles or x number of right turns,” Stein explained.
Instead of listing the results as dry statistics, the car turns into a character.
“It’s like a friend, a driving companion to keep out the loneliness,” Stein said. “We try to make it more playful so that it feels like you actually have a companion you’re sharing an experience with. The way you talk to it is through your driving.”
Dr. Leslie Saxon, chief of cardiology at Keck and the executive director of the Center for Body Computing, believes innovative cars like Nigel can be used to draw attention to unhealthy habits and call for change.
“What we’re trying to do with Nigel is to give him an awareness of his health, and make health fun and engaging for him, so he learns himself and helps us learn ourselves,” Saxon said. “What better thing to integrate into driving? It’s a matter of if you’ve got the technology and if you can do the match-ups and hook it into an existing sensors system, why not make people more aware?”
The project will feature MEMS-enabled devices and ultrasound-enabled sensors. One example of this type of device is the EKG-enabled iPad at the conference that measured attendees’ heart rates just by placing their hands on its cover.
Saxon said she hopes Nigel is only the beginning of what researchers can do with this technology.
“Hopefully, we’ll get everything in there, blood pressure, figure out what the air pollution is, content, all factors of health,” Saxon said. “There are already tons of sensors in there. A lot of them will be wireless. It may just be the way you touch the steering wheel, or the way you lay back in your seat.”
Avimaan Syam, a second-year graduate student at SCA’s Department of Interactive Media who has worked on Nigel since last year, said that although this kind of technology can seem unusual, projects like this will become more commonplace in the future.
“Whenever we first start to explain Lifelog to people, I think they get nervous that it’s a company recording your history — that Big Brother is watching — but that’s not the purpose at all,” he said. “The way we interact with the car and our expectations for a car when we’re driving is going to change a lot in the next few years. What we’re going to want out of our car is going to change in a way that the general public cannot imagine right now.”

Thousands of people made their way through more than nine miles of car-free Downtown L.A. streets Sunday in celebration of the fifth CicLAvia event, which was the first time the event passed by the University Park Campus.
Movement · Thousands of bicyclists pedal down Figueroa Street on Sunday as part of the fifth CicLAvia event. Officials closed more than nine miles of Downtown L.A. streets. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
The semi-annual event derives its name from ciclovía, a weekly street closure event in Colombia that translates to “bike way.” The event came to fruition as a result of people from the bicycling, environmental community and urban planning communities coming together and creating an event in Los Angeles in the same vein as the Bogota phenomenon.
Organizers estimated that more than 100,000 participants bicycled in Sunday’s CicLAvia.
Though the event had some residents worried about the potential imposition to traffic flow, David Galaviz, executive director of USC Local Government Relations, said the big picture positives outweigh the nuisance.
“We see this as a great opportunity to really enhance not only university-community relationships citywide, but also neighbor-to-neighbor relationships throughout the entire city,” Galaviz said. “The university been a supporter of CicLAvia for a long time. We’re not in the business of stopping events.”
Los Angeles’ own “bike way” began in 2010 and, despite the issue of traffic, Aaron Paley, president of Community Arts Resources and staff member of CicLAvia, said the event has received overwhelmingly positive feedback since its start.
“We understand that for many people that this event is an imposition, and we’re appreciative of their forbearance of it,” Paley said. “However, this is such an overwhelmingly positive thing and it provides such a great opportunity for tens of thousands of Angelenos. We hope that the kind of general good outweighs the difficulty that it causes.”
While Sunday’s event was the fifth CicLAvia event, it was the first to travel south, passing by the University Park Campus and eventually ending at Exposition Park.
“There was a group of activists in South L.A. that were really hoping to bring CicLAvia into South L.A.,” Paley said.  “We did have a route that went down Central Avenue, but we couldn’t get past Washington because of the Blue Line railroad tracks. Since we couldn’t go down Central to get to South L.A., we looked at other opportunities and realized that Figueroa was fantastic. It’s a straight shot and we hit USC, Exposition Park and all these other great things along the way.”
Besides coordinating the traffic implications of the event, CicLAvia organizers also worked with USC to get the campus involved.
“We have been meeting with [CicLAvia organizers] over the course of a few months to ensure that transportation services were aware that this was going on,” Galaviz said. “In turn, they asked us to make sure as much as possible that we informed the university community that this was happening on campus — to let students know that this was occurring and also to encourage them to participate.”
Jacqueline Ramirez, a student studying public health with USC’s Keck School of Medicine, recently got involved with CicLAvia as a part of a project and hopes to bring the various health benefits of the event to light.
“When I was doing research for my own project, I thought ‘someone is already doing it — might as well join forces,’” Ramirez said. “I came in as a public health student saying, ‘Hey, this is a public health event. Let’s emphasize that aspect of it.’”
Ramirez also added that she hopes to see a big USC presence at future events.
“We’re a biking community within the campus — now, students should learn to navigate themselves through L.A., which can be an overwhelming task,” Ramirez said. “It’s important that students get involved because we have our creative minds. We see an event, and we see what we could do to improve it. Not one single person can get something done.”
Paley encouraged participants to take the healthy lifestyle the event seeks to promote and adapt it to their lives.
“Our message is that this is a great city that you can enjoy in other ways besides your car,” Paley said. “If you discover it beyond your car, you’ll see that it’s actually a much more intimate and exciting city than you even imagined.”

Composing the musical score for a television show full of hopelessness and destruction might sound like a depressing task, but for USC alumnus Chris Lennertz, it’s been a dream come true.
Thornton talent · Revolution composer Chris Lennertz graduated from the Thornton School of Music in 1995. When he’s not scoring television shows, he gives guest lectures at Thornton and the School of Cinematic Arts. – | Photo courtesy of Costa Communications
It’s not just that Lennertz is pursuing his passion for scoring, which he first discovered as a sophomore in the ’90s at the Thornton School of Music. He also happens to be working with his best friend, Eric Kripke, creator of  apocalyptic drama Revolution.
Lennertz and Kripke met as pledges in the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. Both soon discovered that they shared some similarities: Lennertz was a movie buff and Kripke was a film major. The two bonded over their love of cinema, and the bromance has been going strong ever since.
“We became best friends,” Lennertz said. “I [scored] all of his student films for free.”
Both men have come a long way since their frat days, but even back then both recognized the drive and skill that would later serve them in their careers.
“Chris has always been incredibly talented and an excellent musician and composer,” Kripke said. “When I was at USC and I started making my student films, I grabbed him as quick as I could.”
Lennertz, who graduated from Thornton in 1995, has seemingly always had the talent: After all, he had played music since he was a kid. Still, it took him until his sophomore year in college to realize his passion for composing.
“I was a music major from the beginning, but I was originally a performance major because throughout high school I was mostly playing guitar. When I got to ’SC I started doing more writing and composition,” Lennertz said. “As a sophomore, I got to sneak into a recording session with Henry Mancini at Universal and the next day I went and changed my major and said that’s what I want to do.”
Lennertz’s parents were supportive of his major and his passion, but his mother couldn’t help but remind him that he needed a fallback plan, like a degree in teaching.
Lennertz didn’t see it that way.
“I felt that I was either going to make it or die trying,” Lennertz said.
In pursuit of his vision, Lennertz moved out to Venice Beach after graduation with a couple of friends. A year later, Kripke and three of his friends moved into the same apartment building, a situation Lennertz humorously describes as being “like Melrose Place.”
The continued post-grad interaction proved fortuitous. Composing the music for his best friend’s show has been a great collaborative experience for Lennertz, who uses the characters’ stories as inspiration for his music.
“First and foremost, it’s what I see on screen, which is the picture without music. I always ask Eric or whichever producer I’m dealing with what they’re trying to get out of it,” Lennertz said. “A lot of what we’ve been writing has been about telling the story of this young girl out on her own and with no family trying to save her brother. That informs my decisions. I try to be what the voice on the inside of the character’s head is.”
And even despite his success, Lennertz continues to maintain his ties to USC, giving back to a community that offered him critical opportunities in his time here.
“Throughout the last four or five years I’ve been guest lecturing at least once a semester both at the film school and at the music school. I love to go down there and teach and try to help out,” Lennertz said. “Even after college the first person that I worked for was a USC alumnus. He was my mentor after school and the only reason I got that job was because he was a USC alumnus and he came back and spoke in a class. I feel like the USC family really worked.”
Phoenix Delgado, the assistant dean for advancement at Thornton, finds Lennertz’s success thrilling and  sees it as a great enhancement to the profile of USC.
“Any time that one of our graduates goes on to have a significant career in their field it has an incredibly positive impact on USC Thornton and our faculty, staff and students,” Delgado said. “Christopher Lennertz is a perfect example of this, and we are incredibly proud of the success that he is having.”
According to Lennertz, this success stems from two pieces of advice.
“Number one, keep in touch with all of the young talented filmmakers you meet while you’re at USC because that’s how I ended up working with  Eric. And then take every opportunity you have to apprentice [under] other USC alumni who are doing what you want to do and learn from them,” Lennertz said. “Expand both your contact base and your education by doing that. … That is the main reason why my career has gone well.”

Breaking up is hard to do, even when romance isn’t a factor. It’s difficult to know how to gently let go of a close friend without completely incinerating any bridges or making an enemy for life.
Unfortunately, parting from a friend is sometimes inevitable, no matter how much it hurts. Not all relationships last forever.
This parting doesn’t necessarily need to be done gently, though. Be honest with him or her. Don’t sugarcoat how you really feel, because this doesn’t do anyone any favors. Your friend put in the time with you, so the least that you can do is show him or her some respect by saying what’s on your mind.
Then again, maybe this friend doesn’t deserve your respect. Friendships are not immune to messy arguments and brutal endings.
People drift apart. They also make mistakes and hurt each other and act like jackasses. Or it could turn out that you really didn’t know your friend as well as you thought, after all. Years of spending time together can lead up to one moment of realization that you and this friend are no longer compatible. A sudden yet inexplicable internal change occurs, and you find you simply don’t view the other person the same way anymore. Nobody did anything wrong; it just happened.
None of these situations is easy — they all hurt in their own way. A friend breakup can be even worse than a romantic breakup. Romance is great and all, but a good friend fills an extremely specific void. When he or she is removed, that void often remains empty.
It doesn’t help that usually, if you reach the point where you must break up with a close friend, you’ve been friends for a while. It’s only the long-term friendships that receive a dramatic ending; otherwise, it’s merely an acquaintance that fizzled out. Close friends know you inside and out. They’ll point out your flaws with a laugh and hold your hand without any expectations.
Losing a best friend is like losing an appendage. Let’s be real: This is college, so most friendships will probably last longer than romances. That’s why it’s vital to handle this situation with the utmost care.
You shouldn’t thoughtlessly break up with a friend. Evaluate whether this friendship is worth the trouble to save — some are and some aren’t, so decide and proceed accordingly. If there’s a chance the problem can be solved, use your words. Now that we’re legal adults (mostly), it’s time to start acting like it. Don’t shy away from the tough, awkward subjects. Force your mouth to form the words that you know have to be said, even if your tongue seems to be weighed down by novocaine.
“I feel like we’re going in different directions and don’t understand each other anymore.”
“Your friendship is no longer a comfort to me but more of an obligation.”
“Our interactions are completely unequal. You always take and I’m always giving, and I can’t do it anymore.”
Though these sound eerily similar to breakup lines from a second-rate movie, they get the point across. Tell your friend how you truly feel instead of expecting him or her to infer your internal monologue from ignored texts and bad moods.
Assumed telepathy is the silent killer of friendship: No one really knows what another person is thinking. The reason it happens so frequently between close friends is because you expect each other to intuitively understand and predict the other’s needs.
This expectation is unrealistic, however, and only sets you up for failure. Rather than ignoring an issue or a person, be confrontational. If you must, write down what you need to say beforehand and practice in a mirror. Rehearse the way you’ll express what you need to say: Though your memories together are still smile-worthy, the bond you once shared just isn’t the same.
On the other hand, friendships are by no means guaranteed to end with a sad, oops-we’ve-grown-apart whimper. It can also be the case that you feel betrayed by a friend and his or her very existence causes your blood to boil. In this case, don’t hold your anger back. Let them have it. Nobody is asking for a scene worthy of a telenovela, but it’s also unhealthy to keep your emotions bottled up.
Even if your friend doesn’t understand at the moment, you’ll both be happier in the future. A soured connection will only create anxiety and resentment for both parties involved.
It might not be pleasant to acknowledge, but not every friendship is meant to last. People go in and out of our lives for various reasons at different times and that’s just the way it is. At least, that’s what I read on a MySpace profile once.

I thinked we missed the actualy issue students deal with, which are actual break-ups (at any point in time in a relationship). With college friendships, “breaking up” with a person might come more in the form of confronting them about something. Very seldom do college students see “break-ups” between friends. Breaks-ups really only happen when elevated feelings/connections come into play-usually not in the platonic relationship. The only time I’ve seen “friend break-ups” is when the two friends don’t go to the same school/live in different cities, which is never really a good reason to stop showing someone you care about them.

Tommy’s Place became the hotspot for prime electronic music Friday night with artists like Gypsy Mamba, Blue Domino, GRPSDA and Hubble taking the stage and spinning the night away.
Among these talented artists was Edrina Martinez, known to her fans as Astronautica, a proud L.A. native and beat scene queen who stands out from her peers as a rare female talent in the electronic sector.
Drawing inspiration from her musical upbringing, Martinez infuses her cultural influences and innate musical talent into dreamy, sway-inducing sounds. For her eclectic musical styles, Martinez thanks her mother.
“I have a young mom who was really into old-school hip hop, so growing up I was always listening to it,” Martinez recalls.
In addition to her undiscriminating musical palate, Martinez can play guitar as well as piano and was already carving out a career in music for herself. But she still had to figure out the best genre for her music. That’s when she discovered the beat music scene.
“I had a friend who introduced me to this whole new world of music about two years ago,” says Martinez. “I instantly fell in love with the integration of these hip-hop, jazzy, electronic, down-tempo, heavy bass and whatever-else-you-call-it beats. Being a big fan of all these genres, I wanted to give it a try.”
With encouragement from Daedelus, a fellow experimental electronic artist, Martinez decided to put her music online. She started using SoundCloud, a social sound platform, as well as BandCamp, a site that allows artists to post EPs or LPs as launch pads for their careers in music. Though she did not receive a flood of attention all at once, fans and followers eventually started to come and her clout in the beat scene started to pick up.
That’s no surprise. In her song “Casino,” the rhythmic clicking of the background track, the soothing and futuristic nuances of sound, the climax and the catchy-cool bridge are all there. No, “Casino” is not dance music nor is it a Billboard music chart-topper. But there is a certain profound quality about Martinez’s music, a quality that comes from deep within and attracts people into her sphere of signature stylized, mellow music.
When it comes to creating these alluring and mystical sounds, Martinez credits her L.A. roots.
“I became inspired by the city of Los Angeles and all of its creativity and talented people that come from this area,” says Martinez.
And when it comes to her music, Martinez approaches every session differently.
“I utilize my prior knowledge [alongside] live instruments,” says Martinez. “I play the guitar on a lot of my tracks and I’ll go from there and sample it, creating different tones and textures.”
Martinez also has no regrets when it comes to her stylized choice in music.
“I feel like I can really get a sense of my personality through my music,” says Martinez. “The industry I’m in is its own community, and you get to meet like-minded people who are into the same things as you are.”
Even though she is still in the early stages of her career, Martinez has defined plans for her ever-evolving music. Recently, she signed with Alpha Pup Records and is currently working on wrapping up her first album.
Regarding her music, Martinez notes, “I am constantly trying to change my sound. I don’t want to get stuck. The stuff I’ve been making sounds a lot different from what I was making before.”
And in terms of the future, Martinez sees herself continuing to make music but to “be more grounded in it.”
“I hope [by then] I’ve at least come out with a few albums, toured a bit,” says Martinez. “Maybe start up a little record label, who knows?”
Seeing Martinez in the flashing dark blue, purple and red lights of Tommy’s Place, commanding the mixing board in her seemingly effortless yet stunning way, her future plans definitely seem within reach. Martinez has a keen ear for blending, manipulating and mixing-and-matching sounds. Her fingers are nimble and she is quick to get the right beats, the right feel. Despite having struck up experimental music only recently, Martinez already acts and looks like she’s been doing this for years.
Let’s hope she does.

For the last three decades, Tim Burton has been one of the most notorious and peculiar film directors in Hollywood. His characteristic gothic and dark visuals, bizarre characters and heartfelt themes have become a definite trademark in the movie industry.
A new film from Burton always raises eyebrows, whether it is in fascination, like his early work in Beetlejuice or Edward Scissorhands, or in disappointment, as with his two latest films, Alice in Wonderland and last May’s Dark Shadows.
But fans of his work will be relieved to learn that Frankenweenie, his latest movie, is a part of the former category. Burton’s second animated film — he did not direct The Nightmare Before Christmas, contrary to popular belief — is revitalizing and refreshing both for his career and audiences.
The film is no flashy animated spectacle that relies on 3-D and cheap gags to dazzle. Instead, it boasts a stylish and heartfelt story about a boy and his dog. Though formulaic, the plot effectively wins audiences over by providing them with a well-balanced mix of dark humor, scares and drama — a combination not often seen on screen.
Frankenweenie tells the story of the young Victor Frankenstein (reference to the classical monster completely intended) and his dog Sparky. Victor loves Sparky, his only friend, more than anything else in the world. One day, tragedy strikes Victor when Sparky is run over by a car. Victor then brings his beloved pet back to life using the mysterious electricity that hits the town of New Holland every night. It’s not too long before the other kids (each of them classical archetypes inside the Burton world) find out the truth and decide to try out their own experiments.
The movie is based on a 1984 live-action short film that Burton directed while working at Disney as an animator. Frankenweenie had always been one of his dream projects, and Burton brought it back to life in the form of a stop-motion (a technique that he always intended for the story), full-length, animated movie. And it works surprisingly well.
The essence of the film (penned by USC School of Cinematic Arts alumnus John August) undeniably stems from the devout relationship between Victor and Sparky — which anyone who has ever had a pet can easily relate to — and the film does not lack in laughs or freakouts.  It does, however, follow the “Burton Manual for Eccentric Behavior” a little too closely, which gives the feeling that all of this has been done before.
The aesthetics of the movie work particularly well for its somber tone. Frankenweenie makes use of beautifully crafted stop-motion, one of the few handcrafted techniques left in animation. The detail and work put into each frame appears in the final product, and though watching it in 3-D might distract from this and doesn’t add much to the experience, it doesn’t get in the way of full enjoyment, either. The detailed nuances of the film might be lost on younger audiences (just as in The Nightmare Before Christmas and Corpse Bride), but hopefully the overall heartfelt feeling of the story will override the scary quality of the film for young viewers.
Interestingly, Frankenweenie marks the first Tim Burton movie that features neither Johnny Depp since 2003’s Big Fish, nor his wife Helena Bonham Carter since 1999’s Sleepy Hollow. In their place, Burton reunites with former collaborators Winona Ryder and Catherine O’Hara, among other talents, who create an effective, but not celebrity-based, cast of voice talent. The movie does not need star names to lift it up.
And for all the film geeks out there, Frankenweenie serves as one of the biggest homages to classic horror films in recent years, featuring the more-than-obvious connection to Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and characters  from the Werewolf to Godzilla. If you look closely, this charming animated movie can very well turn out to be a revival of every B-horror movie ever released.
If Dark Shadows showed us why Burton has been doing the same thing over and over again, for all the wrong reasons, Frankenweenie does the same for all the right ones. Though far from being his best work, the movie is a feel-good, well-crafted animated feature that contains every fundamental characteristic of the director while still having a charm that shines on its own. Though darker than it appears at first sight, the film will please younger audiences as well as older ones, especially if they are horror fans.
If someone was thinking that Burton was in decay after his latest works, Frankenweenie is the best example to prove that there’s still some of that intriguing and freakish genius inside him.

Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law last week banning California parents from subjecting children with homosexual feelings to reparative therapy — or, as it is more colloquially known, “praying away the gay.” In response, critics have taken up arms against the ban, calling it an infringement on religious liberties.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
Despite the fundamental importance of religious freedom in a democracy such as the United States, to claim that reparative therapy falls under our First Amendment right clouds the true nature of individual liberties in America. As tolerant individuals, we as Americans must identify the clear distinction between freely practicing one’s religion and forcing damaging practices on others under the guise of religious freedom.
Reparative therapy is a sham of a treatment touted by proponents as a “cure” for homosexuality. In many therapy sessions, a religious leader aims to invoke the power of God to squelch the recipient’s physical attraction to people of the same sex. Other, less religious therapists use sessions to attempt to pinpoint the source of homosexuality in individuals and to help them past this “trauma.”
The bill in question that Brown signed into law, Senate Bill 1172, will take effect Jan. 1 and does not outlaw reparative therapy specifically, but instead bans practitioners from working with unwilling minors to change their sexuality. The governor’s hope, as he declared when signing the bill into law, is that SB 1172 will help push the practice toward the “dustbin of quackery,” but proponents of reparative therapy are fiercely pushing back against what they incorrectly label as an abridgement of religious freedom.
David Pickup, a spokesman for the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, is just one of many people filing lawsuits against the state in an effort to repeal the law. He calls the new legislation “the height of political and therapeutic irresponsibility.” But the bill merely prohibits parents and guardians from forcibly subjecting their children to a practice that has been shown to be damaging to impressionable minors.
According to the American Psychiatric Association, reparative therapy amplifies depression and anxiety disorders and increases the risk of suicidal behavior in individuals undergoing the treatment. Such evidence clearly displays the potential dangers of this practice, especially for those who do not undergo “treatment” completely of their own volition. Though the government should not prevent consenting adults from reparative therapy, it does have a responsibility to protect children from practices that might prove harmful to them.
Those who argue that the legislation is an attack on the First Amendment are missing the point of religious liberties and individual rights. These constitutional provisions exist not to allow adults to subject children to such misguided practices as reparative therapy, but to protect all individuals from arbitrary exercises of state power that seek to prevent them from practicing their religion.
Sending one’s child to “pray away the gay” does not count as practicing religion. The bill does not prevent speech against homosexuality, nor does it bar individuals from prayer or free worship. It merely serves as a necessary ban on something that can be incredibly detrimental to a child’s long-term mental health and personal well-being.
The flurry of lawsuits against the state in response to the bill is to be expected and is a function of the First Amendment right to free speech. The outcomes of these cases, though, must serve to firmly communicate what religious liberty really entails.
Nobody, including bigots who mask their intolerance with claims of piety, should be able to force their prejudices upon children. Brown’s action is a positive step toward protecting children from what could be called emotional abuse, not an attack on religious freedom.
We must always staunchly defend the freedom to practice one’s own religion without interference from the state, as it remains absolutely vital to any liberal democracy. But that  right does not extend to people who aim to influence the freedom of minors through questionable therapy.
And though Brown took the first step, the way to truly do away with reparative therapy is to generate conversation and awareness about the topic, and for Americans everywhere to defend the line between true religious freedom and abuse of a First Amendment right.

This so called “reparative therapy” aka “pray away the gay” is such an archaic way of thinking and it is impossible to even comprehend how some people actually believe that this should be done!!!!!!  what is it going to take for these naive ignorant people to understand that being born gay is NOT a choice it’s the natural way that you were born, just like being born left handed or right handed or ambidextrous!  It wasn’t that long ago that adults would hit and beat very young children for being left handed! My grandmother suffered this punishment for many years for being left handed, when she passed away at the age of 89 she was still left handed……..
“Left handedness was associated with devilry and bad luck. Superstitions that differentiate between left and right always consider the left to be bad, unfortunate, cursed, poisonous and satanic.
The Catholic Church at one point declared that being Left Handed made you a servant of the Devil. The word ‘left’ in many languages is associated with evil, trouble or the devil. In Latin ‘left’ comes from ‘sinister’.”
I’ll say it again……… very, very archaic thinking!  I think it is fantastic that this law has passed, hopefully it will keep a lot of children from suffering the wrath of this archaic punishment.
I also just want to put this in. To say that someone is “born gay” and that it is “who they are” is a contradiction. Who we are is not defined by how we are born or by the conditions thrust upon us, but by the choices we make. I suffer from depression, but it’s not who I am. My daughter has asperger’s, but it’s not who she is. Stop treating this as though people are trying to change who someone is. It’s not who they are until they choose it, even if you could argue that they are born with it.
You don’t CHOOSE Aspergers or depression, do you???? Did you seek treatment or therapy for your depression? Treatment, therapy, or and IEP for your child? (BTW government doesn’t provide special services for LGBTs that they do for children with autism, Aspergers, etc.). THAT was your choice. No one calls you “Depression” or your child “Aspergers.” Yet we want to thrust this upon LBGTs? We have to label LGBTs. No it isn’t who they are, you are right about that. It isn’t anyone’s else’s business, and they should have the same rights to equality, civil rights and marriage as those like yourself with depression,  or Aspergers, or cancer, or anything else they are born with, or choose. And religious entities aren’t telling you they can cure you when you have Aspergers or depression. Maybe they, for example the Catholic church, should concentrate on their sins and not the perceived sins they project upon others to deflect their shame. I guess it really is all about context, whichever is most convenient. I don’t understand your point, did African Americans “choose” to be second class citizens prior to the 1960s? (And beyond)?
Let’s be objective here! In any branch of therapy there are always quacks, but that doesn’t mean we should ban or discount that branch of therapy. The fact that this article cites repairative therapy as “praying the gay away” shows the author is not interested in report this responsibly, since that phrase comes from one of the more radical forms and is not what repairative therapy is. The APA bases their opinion of repairative therapy on these radical forms but hasn’t conducted any serious study. Some parents my force their kids to engage in the therapy, but fault the parents for that, not the therapy. To ban this therapy from all minors is just ridiculous and irresponsible unless there’s some more serious study on the subject. We may be preventing someone from getting what they really need.
Interesting. Someone has copied the screen name “Gabriel” and it using it to make slurs offensive to many apparently not liking my comments related to USC Greek life issues. 
In addition to the slur above, other have included the screen name H8 Gabe and a response to “Gaye”. The same responder to Gaye provide the comment below to an abortion bill article:
King FrattyCommented October 3, 2012 (5 days ago) at 5:22 PM | Reply
Mind your own business people! Sometimes I go bareback with the ladies and things get out of control. I need this to keep my lifestyle unhindered by some mini-me
In short span, those identifying themselves as Greeks have demeaned gays in genreral, identified me as gay (which I am not) and never addressed in any salient way the issue of Greek life not keeping pace with the greater intellect and social sophistication of students USC is attracting on its path to greatness. In fact, the comments greatly underscore my concerns.
“Bareback with the ladies”–what female student with multiple acceptance choices would want to enter KF’s fantasy or real world promoting unsafe sex at USC?
I repeat my comment–the IFC needs to up their game. If they cannot, USC admin needs to step in to prevent erosion of the exceptional gains in stature for USC with exceptional faculty, programming and student additions. In either case, there needs to be night and weekend entertainment options on campus, ideally at Tudor for the more sophisticated undergraduate students, grad and faculty. That is not hard to arrange.  Not everyone wants to go “bareback with the ladies” or be one of them.
I actually support your gay lifestyle.   I have several gay frat bros in my house.  They happen to be some of my closest bros.   Your anti-row bias is over the top.  Maybe the problem is you?
It is unfortunate that most of the discourse heard over the topic of homosexuality has more to do with “political correctness” and hardly anything to do with science.
I am undergoing reparative/sexual orientation change therapy with a California licensed therapist located in Beverly Hills California and am adding my personal experience to the current politically motivated and unscientific debate within the State of California on this issue to make reparative/sexual orientation change therapy “unethical” or increase restrictions on the same.   
I am a male and my first male “boyfriend”, 22 years ago, was a gay identified man.   Fortunately, at that time,  I knew that identifying as a gay man was a false construct I was creating for myself and being affirmed by the gay affirming society that we live in, and I subsequently broke off the relationship with him.   After many positive and self-affirming years of reparative/sexual orientation change therapy I have come to the whole-hearted truth about myself: that my seeking “romantic” and sexual relationships with other men was a repetitive compulsion to get my family of origin and emotionally absent  “father” to love me.  As is common with most gay-identified and sexually addicted men, I grew up with severe emotional neglect from my father and mother.  Not only was my father “never there” emotionally or physically; my mother made me into her “surrogate husband” and proceeded to have an emotionally incestuous relationship with me.  
As a consequence of this dysfunctional triad, I proceeded to have no interest in the opposite sex because my mother had made sure that I never detached from her and that I never formed a healthy attachment to my father or any other man.   I was in a hostile dependency with my mother, where I needed her for survival but I couldn’t stand her at the same time.  During this period and later, my mother shamed me into never  asserting myself as a boy or man.
As a result of this emotionally incestuous relationship with my mother, I grew to overly identify with women, had major gender identity issues,  hence my feminized mannerisms, but also held no interest in developing intimate attachments or sexual relations with the opposite sex.  I had “had enough with women” via my narcissistic/abusive mother.
In my journey in, and then out of homosexuality, I saw a number of gay affirming  therapists, attended numerous gay affirmative 12-step programs and support groups,  I participated in several “gay pride” parades, and lived very much in a gay affirmative world in West Hollywood, California.  I read a wide variety of gay-affirmative literature and even attempted living the gay lifestyle.  I was told over and over again was that I was born gay and I should just accept myself for “who I am”.  I was also told by several gay affirming therapists that I had “internalized homophobia”.  That is, that I hated myself for being gay.   
NOTHING COULD HAVE BEEN FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH!
Essentially, as much as I tried to make the “gay identity” work for me it never did. 
My sexual relations with other men had their foundations built on a total lack of affection, attention and affirmation from my father and a repetitive compulsion to repeat my childhood sexual abuse.   
	I was looking for love in all the wrong places.
I am grateful every day for my sexual orientation change therapy that has saved my life and me from a false identity and a life that would have never worked for me.
It appears that the proposed lawl in the California Legislature on reperative therapy by will mean that now the California State Legislature is discriminating against me seeking my own identity and instead being forced to adapt to what the California Legislature feel is valuable and important to a group of gay affirming people and their own political agenda.  
Whatever happened to patient autonomy?  I have a right to determine my own identity and who I chose to sleep with and have intimate romantic relationships with.
In my opinion, the State of California is being negligent and completely unscientific in the introduction of such a bill to make reparative/sexual orientation change therapy a restricted form of treatment.  
If the State Legislature of California decides to take such a path, it will most likely suffer the consequences of purporting to be a human rights and tolerant affirming organization and instead be labeled as politically motivated with a gay affirming  agenda; which cares more about being politically correct than being scientifically valid.
Without reparative/sexual orientation change therapy I would not have discovered that my childhood sexual molestation at the hands of another man, significantly distorted my worldview and my relationships with other men.
Reparative/sexual orientation change therapy is healing me.  It has made me a more self-loving, and helped me receive and give love to others, and has helped me feel much better about myself and who I really am.  
I’m so grateful that I did not listen to the gay affirming and politically motivated society and instead, listened to real science and my own inner truth.  That is,  I am not gay nor was I ever born gay.
It seems that many gay affirming and “politically correct” politicians in the California State Legislature want to ensure that the option of reparative/sexual orientation change therapy,  which has helped me tremendously, must cease and not be available to me or anyone else.  
This is an intolerant position,  which does not reflect the “diversity affirming” rhetoric within the same sex attraction community.  As a minority I have experienced significant discrimination in my lifetime.  This discrimination is a doubley damaging to me and  will adversely affect my autonomy as a  patient. 
 Reparative/sexual orientation change therapy has been a very positive and healing experience in my life and it is morally ethical to keep it that way.
Yours Truthfully, 
Chris W.
I agree with Gov. Brown in stopping this abuse for religious motives. This so-called “therapy” has rarely been successful and most often is highly destructive psychologically to the children being subjected to this terrible ordeal.
In terms of the religious rights of parents; however, what about those cases where children suffer life-long crippling or death, because the parents refuse medical help, but place all their reliance on prayer?
What does California law say about that?
No sure this is a good idea as it worked for me.

Last Wednesday’s presidential debate was hard to watch. Not because of moderator Jim Lehrer’s failure to control the debate or President Barack Obama’s lack of energy, although those things didn’t help.  Instead, the problems lay with the Internet.
A recent trend that has emerged during the months-long election circuit is following debates online. Twitter has made it especially easy for people to watch debates and comment on them in real time. But though social media is beneficial in letting voters connect and converse with one another, it’s deeply detrimental in that it allows for snark and confusion to distract from the important election issues.
Wednesday’s debate was, according to Twitter, the most tweeted American political event of all time, outdoing both the 2012 Democratic and Republic conventions.
When Romney joked about Big Bird, saying he would cut government funds for public broadcasting, the Internet fired back with more than a dozen parody Twitter accounts for Big Bird and other Sesame Street characters. Simultaneously, sarcastic Tweets, comments on the fake accounts and jokes about the longevity of those accounts emerged. Actual level-headed discussion about the debate got lost in the mix.
This is not to detract from social media’s benefits. One of the best things about the Internet is that it allows people to fact-check candidates as they speak, calling out lies and providing factual context to the spin that all politicians tend to create. During live debates, this is useful more than ever. There’s also something to be said for being able to see actual voters’ unfiltered thoughts on the candidates.
The problem, however, is that while the media turns the election into a narrative, the Internet is turning it into a joke. This is not a sports game or a reality television show. This is the presidential election.
Whoever wins in November will take over a recovering but still weak economy, a huge deficit and a war in Afghanistan. Everyone from seniors to first-time student voters will be affected. We should be invested in these issues — but for some reason, we’re cracking jokes and coming up with debate drinking games instead.
Admittedly, politics can be a depressing field, and satire presents a great way to get even gallows humor into the mix and to allow a bit of comic relief. But allowing such comedy to oversaturate discourse leaves us with hyperbole and superficiality instead of truth. Lehrer did a horrible job as a moderator, and it was good for people to point that out — but for every bit of constructive criticism, there seemed to be some lowbrow, satirical mocking involved.
The Internet is an incredible world where we have the ability to create and laugh — but more importantly, it’s a place for voters to share information with each other and create a more educated public that can engage in civic participation.
With the election less than a month away, it’s imperative to recognize that humor has a time and place and a certain level of use. What happens on Nov. 6 will have major consequences for every single American. It’s time we encourage each other, both online and off, to focus on the serious issues.

Twitter is about mass communication – instantly. Both candidates had their accounts actively tweeting during the debate. Is that diversion? I think that the interactivity of twitter during the debate enhanced the debate experience and spread it to the many that could not set aside two hours to sit in front of a television.
you sound like a lot of fun
