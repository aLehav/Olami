USC was selected as one of 20 universities in the world to build an energy-efficient home for the U.S. Department of Energy’s 2013 Solar Decathlon.
Two architecture professors will lead a multidisciplinary team of USC students over the next two years to design and build an innovative and energy-efficient solar home for a single-family dwelling.

Alice Kimm, chair of undergraduate studies in the School of Architecture, applied for the start-up grant of $100,000 last fall, which qualified USC to participate. Kimm, in collaboration with Gary Paige, a visiting critic at the USC School of Architecture, will guide the students working on the project.
“Our overall goal is to bring an energy-efficient house to the world,” Kimm said.
The professors said they would like the house to built on or near campus, ideally Exposition Park, but have not determined where. Final projects are judged on a range of 10 separate performance categories including design, energy efficiency, livability and affordability.
The project already is getting its feet on the ground at USC. Solar Decathlon is a topic studio class in the architecture school this semester. Nine undergraduate and four graduate students signed up for the course, which broke up the students into teams to develop six unique design ideas for the competition. At the end of the semester, the students will select the best design and that will serve as the design schematic for the actual competition prototype.
Christine Tanguay, a senior majoring in architecture, is one of the students enrolled in the design studio. Tanguay said the class comes with its own unique set of challenges.
“We have a set of rules, a budget and many other constraints that are required by the competition beyond the regular California building code,” Tanguay said.
The Solar Decathlon competition isn’t limited to architecture students; students from interdisciplinary backgrounds are encouraged to join the team to work on the project. Tanguay said the interdisciplinary element was also a draw.
“I was inspired by the fact that the competition will incorporate many schools at USC and we will be required to collaborate on a holistic, sustainable design,” Tanguay said.
Kimm envisions Viterbi students working on solar technology, Marshall students establishing a marketing strategy for selling the house, Annenberg students creating a public relations campaign, School of Cinematic Arts students documenting the progress and students at Rossier School of Education bringing students from Los Angeles Unified School District to visit the house to learn about environmentally sustainable living.
“USC has the opportunity to do incredible collaborations,” Kimm said. “It’s all here on campus.”
When the competition is over, Kimm said, the school plans to dismantle the house and to give it to a family.
“The School of Architecture is very community-based,” Kimm said. “This is the opportunity to give back to the community: to build an energy-efficient house that can set an example in the neighborhood and the city of Los Angeles.”
Students looking to get involved in the competition will be able to find more information on USC’s Solar Decathlon team website, which Kimm said should be online in two weeks.

Students have reacted favorably to plans to refurbish and add to McDonald’s Swim Stadium, which has not been renovated since it was built for the 1984 Olympics.
Athletic Director Pat Haden announced the redesign on Feb. 17 and shortly after, the Athletic Department released preliminary renderings of the project.
Construction is scheduled to begin in January 2013 and finish by April 2014. The renovation will cost between $15 million and $18 million, said Ron Orr, senior associate athletic director. At this time, the university has not chosen a contractor for development.

The renovation will include new locker rooms for the water polo, swimming and diving teams. There will also be a contemporary sundeck overlooking the pools and covered stands on both sides of the stadium.
Tim Tessalone, sports information director, said the renovations to the stadium will better reflect the accomplishments and skills of USC athletics.
“We have so many high-caliber Olympic-level swimmers and water polo players who compete there now,” Tessalone said. “A facility on par with their abilities, [one] that helps them reach their goal. is critical.”
Deidre Yiu, a freshman majoring in business administration, said that the redesign is long overdue.
“I never go swimming at USC because the facilities are so run-down,” Yiu said. “I’ll definitely go more after they remodel [the stadium].”
Kristi Hupka, a freshman majoring in industrial and systems engineering, said the addition of a sundeck will make the aquatic center more inviting.
“The stadium needs to be a less intimidating place to hang out,” Hupka said. “I feel like I can never go in there because of swim team or water polo practices. I’m excited that they’re planning to make the facilities more accessible to non-athletes.”
Ashley Barlow, a freshman majoring in fine arts, said that redesigning the stadium will convince more students to support athletic teams.
“I live in Fluor Tower, right next to [the stadium], but I never go to the games because the bleachers are old and dirty,” Barlow said. “If there were nicer bleachers and places for students to hang out, I would have gone to a lot more of the water polo games and I’m sure that my friends would have too.”
The decision to redesign the stadium was spurred in part by a gift to the athletic department from an undisclosed donor. The gift was specifically allocated to fund the renovation of the aquatics center, although additional funds are being raised to complete it.
We are thrilled to see this incredible renovation being done for all students including the water polo players and swimmers who over the years and currently have brought so much national acclaim to USC and where Olympians train.
However, in the article, one student claims that she doesn’t come to water polo games b/c the current stands are “dirty.”   As someone who has sat in the stands for almost every water polo match for four seasons, the action of a USC water polo match quickly diverts ones attention away from any mild discomforts… plus, for goodness sake, are college students this fragile?  C’mon, just bring a blanket like the rest of us do and come watch the women go for the NCAA championship this spring and your four-time National Champion Men next fall!

Two Undergraduate Student Government Senators introduced resolutions to create more gender-neutral accommodations for transgender students at the USC Senate meeting Tuesday night. The resolutions addressed student concerns on gender-neutral bathrooms and gender-neutral housing.
Both resolutions are not final and can be amended before they are voted on at the Senate meeting on March 6. Resolutions communicate to the administration the student body’s opinion on a particular issue.
USG · Senators Edward Chau (left) and Keshav Tyagi (right) introduced resolutions regarding gender-neutral accommodations on campus. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The first resolution, introduced by Residential Senator Keshav Tyagi, advocates for the conversion of an existing bathroom in the Student Union to a gender-neutral bathroom. Tyagi said the reason for targeting that particular bathroom was because of its proximity to the LGBT Resource Center and the Women’s Center in the building.
“We are the Trojan Family and how can we say we are a family if we don’t treat every person here equally or accommodate every person’s needs,” Tyagi said.
Eighty-four percent of 94 respondents to a survey on gender-neutral bathrooms were in favor of creating a gender-neutral bathroom in the Student Union. Tyagi, who drafted the survey with USG Director of Diversity Affairs Josh DeMilta, said the survey was promoted, in part, by the LGBT Resource Center. Tyagi said he also consulted with transgender students when writing the resolution.
[Correction: A previous version of this article indicated that Josh DeMilta is the USG Director of University Affairs. He is the USG Director of Diversity Affairs. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
Commuter Senator Edward Chau also introduced a resolution Tuesday urging USC Housing to begin a pilot program for gender-neutral housing on the Rainbow Floor in Century Apartments, a housing option for LGBT students and allies.
“As of now, there is no ruling to move forward with gender-neutral housing,” said Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center.
Earlier in the year, the resident adviser on the Rainbow Floor submitted a proposal to the administration for gender-neutral housing. USC’s current policy is to assign roommates by birth sex. The proposal seeks to leave that policy unchanged but to allow to gender-mixed suitemates within the apartment.
“That wouldn’t solve the problem completely but at least it would be a step in the right direction toward creating a more supportive environment for the students who want to participate in the gender-neutral option [on the Rainbow Floor],” Vigil said.
Of the 530 respondents to an online survey conducted by USG, nearly 80 percent of respondents supported a pilot program where students have an option to live with the opposite gender.
In addition to Chau, the housing resolution was authored by Commuter Senator Howard Chang and sponsored by Vinnie Prasad, a residential senator and USG vice president-elect.
The resolution cites Harvard, Yale, Princeton and Stanford as examples of universities that have begun offering a “gender inclusive housing option” within the last seven years.
Tyagi said he received some negative feedback from the survey on gender-neutral bathrooms. Some students said the USC administrators should place more concern on other issues, such as bikes and recycling policies, rather than on creating more gender-neutral bathrooms.
“Responses like that cater to just the disconnect about transgender awareness on this campus and that’s something that needs to be addressed,” Tyagi said.
Vigil said the number of self-identifying transgender students who utilized the resource center increased from one last year to 10 this school year.
“Our students are very supportive of any method to make our university more trans-friendly,” Vigil said. “With that increasing environment we should be able to create a more supportive environment for them so this is a step in the right direction, our students would argue.”
This is a great article! But let’s be clear: gender and sex are two different things. The author constantly refers to the gender neutral housing as an option for students of the opposite gender to live together–I don’t think this is the case. If a person is transgender, then their gender does not match their biological sex. Thus, allowing a biological female who (identifies as male gendered) to live with biological males (who identify as male gendered) is not allowing people of “the OPPOSITE gender” to live together. It is merely allowing trans people to live among people of the SAME gender as any non-trans Trojan. Let’s have equality for all :)

The No. 5 USC men’s swimming squad, led by four All-Americans, will compete in the Pac-12 Men’s Swimming Championships at the East Los Angeles College Swim Center in Monterey Park, Calif. on Wednesday.
“The men’s team continues to improve over the past five years and the 2012 edition is probably the best that I have had the pleasure to coach,” said USC coach David Salo. “Last year we finished third in the Pac-10 and seventh in the NCAA Championships. With the maturation of last year’s team, I expect that competing for the top three spots in the Pac-12 is realistic along with a top five performance at the National Championships.”
Salo said he is happy with the direction of the program. “We expect to be a top five program in the country year in and year out and will be able to contend for a NCAA Championship title from this level of performance. We have a great coaching staff and tremendous support from the university to provide our student-athletes with all the resources to be successful in the classroom and in the pool.”
USC (4-3, 2-3), despite the confidence of its coach and the university, sits in the most competitive swimming and diving conference in the country. The conference currently has four teams ranked in the top six in the nation (No. 1 Arizona, No. 3 Stanford, No. 5 USC, No. 6 California), and Stanford has won the last 30 conference team championships, beginning their streak in 1982.
USC is hoping to build on last season’s strong performance in the postseason, where they finished third in the Pac-10 and seventh in the NCAA Championships. They also hope to maintain their momentum carried over from their win over Pac-12 rival Utah in the final meet of the season, where freshman Cristian Quintero won the 500-yard and 1650-yard in his swimming debut.
“Cristian was a big pickup as he is an immediate threat to score big in the 200-500-1650 freestyle events as well as contribute significantly to our relays,” Salo said. “Aside from Cristian, we expect the usual big time performances from Vlad Morozov and Dima Colupaev as well as Alex Lendrum.”
The championships begin at 6 p.m. on Wednesday with the 200-yard medley and 800-yard freestyle, and continue through Saturday.

As the race for the 2012 Republican nomination heats up, Rick Santorum recently stirred up a bit of controversy. Speaking to an audience in Michigan, Santorum addressed President Obama’s message that he thinks all American citizens should have the chance to go to college.
“President Obama once said that he wants everybody in America to go to college,” Santorum told the group watching him speak, “What a snob.”
Santorum continued that there are “good, decent men and women,” who “aren’t taught by some liberal college professor trying to indoctrinate them.” He said that he understands why Obama “wants you to go to college. He wants to remake you in his image.”
Clips from the speech have gone viral and have generated much discussion on social networking sites. One segment from the video that has begun drawing attention is that following the end of Santorum’s remarks, a man in a University of Michigan sweatshirt is seen clapping.
In addition to this supporter of Santorum who seemingly also supports a public university, another popular topic for discussion lies in the fact that Santorum himself received a B.A., and an M.B.A, and later also received a J.D. after graduating law school—and his three degrees account for a higher number of degrees than Obama’s.

The No. 1 Trojans (13-0) will have a chance to extend their win streak to 34 matches when they take on No. 3 UCLA (11-1) in a non-conference clash at the Los Angeles Tennis Center today at 2 p.m.
Bad blood · Senior Daniel Nguyen and the Trojans hope to win their third straight match against the Bruins. USC has won 33 straight matches. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
USC last played on Friday in a doubleheader against No. 24 San Diego and San Diego State and defeated both squads 7-0 for the Trojans’ seventh and eighth sweep of the season.
The two matches were USC’s fifth and sixth in a week’s time. Before the doubleheader, the Trojans had battled through four matches in four days against top-20 opponents in Charlottesville, Va., to earn their first Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Team Indoors Championships since 1988.
They will now turn their focus toward the Bruins, who currently hold the series advantage 99-84. Last season, USC took both matches, most recently a 4-3 victory in Westwood in USC’s regular season finale last year.
“There’s going to be a lot of energy from them. The crowd will be loud. It’s going to be a good match,” No. 38 freshman Yannick Hanfmann said.
No. 5 senior Steve Johnson leads a group of six ranked Trojans in singles with 47 consecutive singles wins. Also streaking are No. 32 sophomore Emilio Gomez with 10 straight wins and Hanfmann with seven.
No. 15 senior Daniel Nguyen and No. 22 sophomore Ray Sarmiento hold 22-7 and 19-7 records in singles, respectively.
Meanwhile, freshman Roberto Quiroz earned Pac-12 Player of the Week honors for his two doubles and two singles wins in the doubleheader against the San Diego schools.
In doubles, USC has one ranked pair in Hanfmann and Johnson, who stand at No. 6 with a 10-2 doubles record this season.
UCLA has four ranked players in their rotation, including No. 33 Nick Meister, No. 81 Clay Thompson, Adrien Puget and Marcos Giron.
“We’re going to take it like another match, but we don’t want to lose to them. I’m looking forward to it,” Sarmiento said.
The Bruins will enter the contest with three straight wins, with their only loss of the season coming against No. 5 Duke in the first round of the ITA National Team Indoors Championships.
Though the Trojans claim that they are eager for the rival matchup, they insist they have retained their composure for a hard fought battle.
“There’s always that extra fire, but we just want to go out there and play like it’s any other match and not put too much pressure on ourselves,” Nguyen said.
consecutive NCAA championship, Nguyen supplied a simple formula for his team to maintain their so far perfect season.
“The main thing is just to focus on what we need to improve, keep working hard each day and have a positive mindset,” Nguyen said.

After a strong start that saw them take the lead through two days of play, the No. 4 USC women’s golf team could not close out the victory, nonetheless turning in a solid performance and finishing third at the 2012 Allstate Sugar Bowl Intercollegiate in New Orleans Tuesday.

After leading by four strokes heading into the final round, the Women of Troy concluded play with a score of 17-over 881. Duke overcame a four-stroke deficit to win the tournament at 13-over 877, while Colorado came in second at 16-over 880.
Following a resounding opening tournament at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge, in which they finished second, the Trojans were determined to capture their first victory of the season. They jumped out to a quick start Sunday, recording a score of 5-over 293 to maintain small leads over Oregon and Duke. Senior Lisa McCloskey and freshman Doris Chen led the way, with McCloskey firing a 1-under 71 and Chen shooting even-par 72 to stake the Trojans to the early lead. McCloskey recorded four birdies, including two on the back nine, while Chen notched three. Sophomore Sophia Popov shot 2-over 74, going 1-over on the front and back nines, while senior Inah Park shot a 4-over 76 and sophomore Rachel Morris finished at 7-over 79.
The Women of Troy extended their lead Monday, shooting a 4-over 292 for an overall score of 585. Both McCloskey and Chen shot 1-under 71 and combined for seven birdies to place second and third, respectively. Popov overcame a rough start to birdie five of her final 10 holes, coming in tied for 14th at 3-over 147. Morris matched her score to hit 14-over 158, while Park shot a 5-over 77 to end two rounds tied for 43rd.
The Trojans gave up considerable ground Tuesday, surrendering their lead amid difficult conditions. McCloskey maintained her score from the previous two rounds, once again firing 1-under 71 to finish third overall. The tournament marked the fourth top-10 finish in five tournaments for McCloskey, who finished two back of Colorado’s Alex Stewart. Chen recorded her second consecutive top-10 finish, notching two birdies and finishing seventh at 1-over 217. Popov finished tied for 16th at 6-over 222 and Park tied for 46th at 13-over 229, while Morris tied for 61st at 20-over 236.
Though the tournament marked the team’s second consecutive top-three finish, the Women of Troy weren’t particularly happy about the outcome.
“I had a good tournament considering the course and conditions were difficult,” McCloskey said. “For me, it was a rather poor finish and unfortunately, we’re not quite happy with the third place.”
The Women of Troy will next participate March 18-20 in the Battle at Rancho Bernardo, hosted by San Diego State.

When Los Angeles Times writer Owen R. Bird coined the term “Trojans”  100 years ago in a track and field preview, the 25-year-old had no way of knowing that his invention of the nickname would be one of the most timeless images over the past century.
For most schools, a nickname is just that. It’s the face of school pride, a mascot, an easy way to brand merchandise to the masses.
From the Billikens to the Catamounts to the Runnin’ Rebels and the Zips, nicknames have turned universities into laughable caricatures of themselves.
Not so at USC.
To most, the Trojans are remembered as the romanticized figures in Homer’s epic poems, The lliad and The Odyssey. They are remembered as the brave souls who courageously fought to the end, before their city of Troy was seized and burned by the Achaeans during the Trojan War.
But on these grounds, Bird’s poignant term has transcended its initial purpose.
Here, the term Trojans is not a creation of Greek mythology. It’s not even a simple seven-letter word that a crafty journalist conjured up back in 1912.
On this campus, the Trojans represent a sense of belonging, a family and a university built on success in all facets of life.
Whether you’re a parent shelling out tuition money, a student having the time of your life or an educator, we can agree that what it means to be a Trojan cannot be explained in a simple sentence or even a scrapbook of anecdotes.
It’s 90,000 people packed in tightly for a Saturday afternoon of football at the Coliseum. It’s the crisp air on a Friday night at Dedeaux Field, where fastballs and double plays usher in the transition between winter and spring.
It’s 116 team national championships, 363 individual NCAA championships and more Olympic medals — 123 — than any institution in the country.
But more than that, it’s the foundation for a truly unique cultural experience.
While the faces who have donned the cardinal and gold have changed over the past 100 years, the face of this university has withstood the test of time.
It’s a face of champions, both on the field and off. It’s a face of innovation, whether in a research lab or in John McKay’s 1970 backfield. It’s a face that celebrates artistry, whether it’s in the field of cinematic arts or a leaping catch by freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee or a sensational backhand down the line by senior Steve Johnson.
What makes being a Trojan so magical is you don’t have to call the campus home Monday through Friday to take part in the experience. There are thousands of people who wear the cardinal and gold and have never hung a fancy diploma in their office.
And that’s the beauty of Bird’s term.
To be a Trojan, you don’t need to be a student, a faculty member, a parent or even an athlete competing on the field of play, because the experience is about taking part in something bigger than yourself.
If this seems like a glorified portrayal of what it means to truly be a Trojan, I challenge you to walk into any building on any day of the week, be it Heritage Hall, Bovard Auditorium or Seeley Mudd.
Go up to the first person you see and ask them what it means to them to be a Trojan.
Odds are they’ll speak of Tommy Trojan, tailgating on Trousdale, a Matt Barkley touchdown pass, shaking hands with Louis Zamperini for the first time or memories that have shaped who they are today.
Look at the genuine enthusiasm in their eyes, the glowing smile on their face, the unyielding pride bursting out upon every syllable spoken.
The century-old nickname is about more than school spirit, the millions of dollars made on jerseys and memorabilia every year, the championship plaques and Olympic medal celebrations.
The Trojans are not the Beavers, the Cougars, the Cardinal and they’re certainly not the Bruins.
In all honesty, the Trojans are not even on the same playing field, literally and metaphorically. Not just in this city, the state or around the country. I’m talking globally.
In Los Angeles, Stockholm, London or any other metropolitan city around the globe, try walking past a fellow Trojan and getting ignored. It doesn’t happen.
Because 100 years later, each of us, regardless of our age, race, creed, religion or political affiliation, have taken Bird’s black ink on a page and turned it into an illuminating depiction of how powerful the human bond among thousands worldwide can be.
Whether you attended the school 40 years ago, have a rooting interest in the athletic program as a native Angeleno or appreciate the university’s commitment to academics and research, you know there’s nothing mythical about the Trojans.
For all of us and for those who came before us, there’s nothing more real than to be a Trojan. It’s a part of us, now and forever.

Undefeated, no more.
USC baseball (7-1) lost its first game of the season Tuesday, falling to Pepperdine 7-2 in Malibu. The loss came after the Trojans began their 2012 season with seven straight wins.
Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
Even though it was a question of when, not if, USC would eventually lose a game, USC coach Frank Cruz wasn’t happy.
“Of course it’s a disappointment,” Cruz said. “You don’t play this game to lose.”
The Trojans, aided by senior outfielder Alex Sherrod’s grand slam in the series finale against Akron, were on the wrong end of a bases-loaded home run against Pepperdine (7-2).
With the game scoreless in the bottom of the third inning, junior  second baseman Joe Sever put the Waves ahead to stay with a home run to left field off senior USC starter Brandon Garcia.
“They were able to come up with a huge timely hit,” Cruz said. “That was pretty much the difference in the game.”
Garcia (1-1), normally the Trojans’ designated hitter, made his second Tuesday start of the young season. Garcia pitched just four innings, giving up four hits and five earned runs while striking out four and walking four.
“It was just one of those days for Brandon,” Cruz said. “He’ll be fine. It happens sometimes, and today wasn’t his day.”
Cruz also praised Pepperdine for its strategy against USC.
“They worked the count a lot against Brandon and it paid off for them,” he said. “When you work counts and then get the big hit, good things will happen.”
The Waves, meanwhile, got a slightly better pitching performance from their starter, Matt Maurer (1-0).
The lefty pitched just 5 1/3 innings, but surrendered only two runs and struck out five while earning his first win of the season.
Pepperdine’s Andrew Alvarez and Michael Swanner combined to pitch 3 2/3 innings of scoreless relief to quell any hopes USC had to come back. Cruz emphasized that he was proud to see his team fight until the last out.
“If there’s a positive, it’s that they competed and they never, ever gave up,” Cruz said. “We never stopped fighting, which I was pleased about.”
USC scored its first run in the top of the fifth when senior outfielder Garrett Houts singled to center to plate sophomore shortstop James Roberts and pull the Trojans within three runs. It was as close as USC would get all afternoon, as Pepperdine answered with a run of its own after both Houts’ RBI single and another USC run at the top of the sixth. The Waves got their second home run of the game in the bottom of that frame courtesy of Sam Meyer.
Pepperdine added one more run in the seventh to close out the scoring.
“We’re hoping that we can start to get more guys on base, and we didn’t do that enough today,” Cruz said. “And then we need to knock them in more often.”
The Trojans will need to follow their coach’s advice if they are to have success in their upcoming weekend series with perennial powerhouse North Carolina.
The No. 6 Tar Heels feature a team nationally expected to advance deep into the College World Series.
“We’re going on the road on a long trip,” Cruz said. “We’ll have to be prepared and come out a bit sharper than we did against [Pepperdine].”

Maurice Jones is weary.
He’s weary after watching the USC men’s basketball team lose a school-record 23 times this season.
He’s weary after playing more than 1,000 minutes — a rate of 34.1 per game, seventh-highest in the country.
He’s weary after scoring more than a quarter of the Trojans’ total points.
One-man show · Sophomore Maurice Jones is one of two Trojans averaging double figures. The other, Aaron Fuller, is out for the season. - Luciano Nunez | Daily Trojan
“It’s a big difference from last year and I played a lot last year,” the sophomore guard said. “There have been games where I find myself a little more tired. Just running up and down, I kind of feel it in my legs and it takes a little more time to catch my breath.”
USC coach Kevin O’Neill never anticipated that the 5-foot-7 Jones would be forced to have such a significant role — not at this stage in his career, at least.
O’Neill recruited Jones, a native of Saginaw, Mich., as part of a four-member class in 2010, reeling in other prospects such as Garrett Jackson, Bryce Jones and Curtis Washington.
But Jones, a guard from nearby Woodland Hills, Calif., transferred just two months into his freshman season, and Washington, a sophomore forward, hasn’t played a minute all year because of a shoulder injury sustained last August.
Factor in four more season-ending injuries to a handful of players, including three starters, and it’s easy to see why Jones has been given such a prominent role in recent months. A role, however, that hasn’t necessarily been all that easy.
“It’s a lot to ask of him as a sophomore — to get you 20 [points] a game every game when you have a young team and all these injuries,” O’Neill said.
More or less, Jones has been the elder statesman in the Trojans’ starting lineup. Currently, the unit also consists of two freshmen in guards Alexis Moore and Byron Wesley, coupled with Jackson, a sophomore forward, and junior center James Blasczyk who, despite his experience, is still in his first year with the program after transferring from Lee College in Baytown, Texas.
“We’re shorthanded right now,” said Jones, who hasn’t played less than 38 minutes in a game all season. “We just want everyone to get better.”
But getting better is slightly subjective, especially considering the Trojans have dropped 16 of their last 17 contests and remain in a seemingly never-ending tailspin.
And though Jones leads the team in scoring with 13.5 points per game, in his last four games he has struggled scoring-wise, making just 13 of 52 field goal attempts.
One explanation: He’s out of position, playing point guard as opposed to shooting guard — his natural position, according to O’Neill.
“He plays better off the ball,” O’Neill said. “His game suffered more than anybody’s when Jio [Fontan] went down. It’s just put him where he’s on the ball too much; too many minutes.”
Fontan, a senior, was slotted to start at point guard, as he did last season when the Trojans secured an at-large berth in the NCAA tournament.
But as has been well-documented, he tore his anterior cruciate ligament during an exhibition game in Brazil in August, causing a sort of ripple effect.
Jones, as a result, is the Trojans’ only returner who played any significant minutes for last season’s 19-win team.
At times, he’s looked more than comfortable. During a 63-60 win over South Carolina in the Las Vegas Invitational on Nov. 26, he registered 28 points, one shy of his career high, and connected on all seven 3-point attempts to break USC’s single-game school record. Similarly, a month later, he finished with 25 points and four 3-pointers in a 24-point home rout against TCU.
Then, there are the times he struggles. Against UCLA earlier this month, he made 3-of-11 shot attempts for eight points. And during the month of February, he has averaged 10.29 points per game — a dip below his season average, as the Trojans were winless.
“It’s always frustrating because you want to win,” Jones said. “I want to do well. And I want to see everyone else do well. We just ]don’t have] the number of guys and the ability to do that.”
The hope is that Jones’ load will be a bit lighter next year. He won’t be forced to carry a team so young, so inexperienced. Returning will be backcourt teammates Fontan and Moore, in addition to highly regarded Wake Forest transfer J.T. Terrell. He likely won’t average more than 38 minutes per game again, either.
Looking toward 2013 might not make the current predicament any easier — the Trojans still have at least three games left this season — but simply hearing “next year” seems to be the closest thing to a glimmer of hope for now.
“It’s not going to be like this next year,” Jones insists. “I don’t plan on us having another season like this. Tough times don’t last, tough people do.”

California Dreamin’, a new production at the MET Theatre, portrays a revisionist interpretation of the events leading up to the infamous Tate-LaBianca murders committed by Charles Manson and his followers the ‘Manson Family.’
Unfortunately, the play attempts to compress the complex and far-reaching implications of that dreadful August night in 1969 into something that’s finite and muddled, robbing the event of its power and mystique.

Written by Jill Charlotte Thomas and directed by L. Flint Esquerra, the play begins with a eulogy by one of the victims’ fathers, Peter Folger (played by veteran actor John F. Goff), who promptly sets up the play’s theme — that society is dictated by the individual, a fact that was certainly true for the counterculture of late 1960s California.
The play makes the case that it wasn’t Charles Manson’s grudge against music producer Terry Melcher that caused him to follow through with his Helter Skelter prediction of an apocalyptic race war on that particular home on Cielo Drive, but rather his being rejected by coffee heiress Abigail Folger, who is the main character of the story.
But the play does not clarify why it focuses on this detail specifically. Even if this series of events were true, it’s only one piece in a big puzzle that touched every corner of the counterculture, which California Dreamin’ doesn’t explore in depth.
The minimalist set uses newspaper headlines from the era as the backdrop, but it doesn’t go any deeper than that. Authentic costumes only do so much to provide meaning.
The murders affected American society, and to simplify these crimes to a story about a disenchanted wealthy liberal trying to figure out her place in the world depreciates the event.
More often than it should, the script relies on exposition to explain how a character is feeling. The audience is told how Abigail feels when she talks about wanting to have a fresh start, but the play never shows her emotionally removing herself from the drugs and hedonism of her peers.
The script does, however, demonstrate a good deal of research; little touches like Abigail calling her mother at 10 p.m. — the last time anyone heard from her — adds an appreciated level of authenticity to the play.
In addition to paying extreme attention to detail, the performances say a lot without anything being said at all. That’s USC alumnus Tyson Turrou’s strength in his portrayal of Charles Manson.
There’s a gradual buildup with his insidious insanity, but it never gets to the point of being a caricature. It’s a gripping performance, one in which Turrou’s silence is just as unnerving as his maniacal rants; it proves more interesting than anything else in the play.
Ivy Khan does a good job portraying Abigail as a woman at odds with her upbringing and her peers; viewers sympathize with her even though they know her journey will end tragically.
Another notable turn is Mark Deliman as Wojciech Frykowski, Abigail’s estranged boyfriend and one of the other victims in the Tate-LaBianca murders.
Deliman provides an energetic and, at times, humorous performance. Unfortunately, he barely appears in the second act.
This goes back to the main issue with California Dreamin’: It wants to present Abigail’s story as the catalyst of the Tate-LaBianca murders but also presents alternative themes that don’t really go anywhere, all the while masking over details that would’ve been more interesting.
Tex Watson, played by Sean Andrews, is turned into a bit character even though he was bloodthirsty in his own right. Abigail and Wojciech’s cultural elitism is prevalent, but it never establishes itself as a consistent theme.
The script needs to concentrate on a consistent theme and to take out scenes that rely entirely on exposition. The story of Charles Manson and his family remains a fascinating and complex affair, and it’s a daunting task to try to compress it into a two-act play. California Dreamin’ offers, at times, a compelling insight into the era and the murders, but it’s too unpolished to really bring the event into perspective.

Ra Ra Riot has gone through some tough times recently, having endured a streak of cancelled shows last November as well as the recent departure of cellist Alexandra Lawn, who cited a wish to pursue different interests.
This created an air of uncertainty surrounding last week’s rescheduled concert at the El Rey Theatre. Ra Ra Riot had not performed in two months, and no one knew if Lawn was going to appear. The two opening bands, Papa and The Submarines, impressed with their sets as the venue gradually filled with an eclectic crowd. As Blake Hazard of The Submarines wound down her set, one question hung over the crowd: How would the new look Ra Ra Riot look?
For now, the answer is “unfinished.” The band came on at a quarter past ten, Lawn-less, and dove into a rendition of “Too Too Too Fast” — a great choice for an opener.  It abounded with energy and musicianship, driven by lead vocalist Wes Miles’ charismatic, ephemeral singing. The song got the crowd bustling immediately.  It was telling, however, that the band chose a song without the usual string section involved: no violin and certainly no cello.
“St. Peter’s Day Festival,” the band’s next song, was a different story. As Rebecca Zeller switched from keyboards to her more customary violin, the absence of Lawn was made very noticeable: a replacement cello player appeared on the far right of the stage to accompany Zeller.
The replacement was perfectly adequate, but the divide present on the stage was glaring. All the remaining members of the band — except the drummer, of course — were up on their feet, shifting about, switching instruments, dancing and swaying to their own irresistible rhythm.
Contrasted to these four was the replacement member: not moving, not sharing in their energy, but rather remaining in her seat — a constant reminder that there was a piece missing from the group. It was clear that she was someone that had been used to plug a hole rather than be involved in the dynamism that the band so embraces.
However, as the show continued, the band began to overcome this problem. Ra Ra Riot called Calder Quartet, a group of four talented violinists that was added as surprise guests, onto the stage.  The band started to get into a groove, showing off the diverse instrumentation that gives Ra Ra Riot its distinctive sound. Soaring strings, driving bass and drums, playful guitar and a sprinkle of keyboards meshed into an almost-indistinguishable blanket of sound, a perfect foundation for Miles’ lyrics to shine as the band played from both its old as well as more-recent material.
Ra Ra Riot took the crowd on a veritable tour of its body of work, almost equally dividing the setlist between material from the band’s two albums. As the quartet left, the band moved away from their more string-heavy numbers into a rousing last few pieces. Starting with “Can You Tell,” a spirited number from the band’s first album that recalls The Smiths, Ra Ra Riot started to inspire the crowd into a frenzy, continuing with “Run My Mouth” and “Ghost Under Rocks” until Miles stopped to talk to the crowd.
He acknowledged late 2011’s cancellations — but not Lawn’s departure — and thanked the crowd for their support, assuring them of that there were better things to come. After the brief pause, the band dove into what is undoubtedly its most famous track, “Boy.” In all its grandiosity, the song reminded the crowd perfectly of what the band is capable of, and soon everyone was clapping in unison to the beat.
After two encore performances, “The Orchard” and “Dying Is Fine,” the question on everyone’s mind remained. There was no way of knowing how the band would move on from losing their cellist and occasional vocalist.
But one thing was clear: The band is still very much capable of performing at a high level, and once it finds a resolution for their cello problem, there is no doubt Ra Ra Riot can reach its old heights again.

For all those hopeless romantics, actors waiting tables and interns working 40-hour weeks without pay, there’s still hope out there: The dream is still alive.
Take James David Larson, for example. As a teen, the now-professional actor saw his first Broadway-caliber production.
Mmm, Spam · Spamalot makes waves with its national tour, traveling everywhere from Key West, Fla. to Los Angeles. The show remains true to The Holy Grail, maintaining the humor fans fell in love with in the first place. - Photo courtesy of Scott Suchman
“When I was 17, I went to see Wicked at the Pantages. It was the first Broadway show I’ve ever seen. It’s amazing that six or seven years later, I’m going back as a performer,” Larson said.
Larson returns to the Pantages to play Not Dead Fred and Prince Herbert in a nationwide production of Spamalot. When speaking about his two alter egos, Larson harbored an air of secrecy.
“Not Dead Fred is the man who’s being taken to the death care, which comes around town — but he’s not dead yet. And Prince Herbert is a prince who’s trapped in a tower and just wants love,” he said. “In the show — well, you’ll just have to come to the show to find out what happens, I guess.”
Larson and the rest of the Spamalot cast will be back in town to wreak humorous havoc on audiences of all ages this week. Be warned: “Expect a great show and a lot of laughs. Expect to be part of the madness,” Larson said.
Though Spamalot is definitely packed with comedy and chaos, Larson noted that life on the road with a touring Broadway production is its own kind of madness.
“It’s a blast. We live out of hotels — I think its great. There’s something different every day,” Larson said. “Yeah, it’s not the easiest thing, but I think it’s a great experience in learning how to manage your time and keep sane when you’re in and out of different places all of the time.”
The 2012 Spamalot tour has been winding in and out of the United States, visiting places that a Broadway show wouldn’t generally expect to stop.
“It’s just a matter of getting to places where people have never been able to see the show before. It’s also special because [these] people haven’t seen the show and we’ve probably never been to these places. It’s a good experience for everyone,” Larson said.
So what kind of cities has the Monty Python-inspired spectacle been visiting?
One place is Key West, Fla., tiny and miles out in the ocean — a stark contrast to Los Angeles, the second-largest city in the nation.
The tour has proven to be a sweeping event as it crosses cultural and geographic boundaries in an attempt to include as many fans as possible.
And it’s not hard to find fans of Monty Python and Spamalot, for good reason.
“Spamalot, just looking at it, is one of the finest shows ever written. It has that outlandish Monty Python humor which is so fresh and speaks to all people,” Larson said.
Fans of Monty Python’s work who haven’t seen the Broadway production show need not worry. Larson added that the magic of the show lies in how seamlessly the writers incorporated the Monty Python everyone loves with live theater.
“The thing about this show is that it is based on Holy Grail, but it also takes on some of the conventions of musical theater,” Larson said. “It takes you into the world of theater instead of just the movie.”
And, for those hardcore Monty Python fans, Larson notes that the show incorporates skits and characters from an assortment of Monty Python works and not just Holy Grail.
“It’s a full-fledged Monty Python experience,” Larson said.
An experience, Larson adds, that is taken to another level through its translation from screen to stage as it becomes more immediate in a theatrical performance.
“You tell a joke and you’re immediately connected with the audience. It’s just kind of this instant bond that we have with each other — performers with the audience, audience with the performers,” he said. “It’s just a really special and secret thing, and that’s why live theater has lasted so long.”
The legacy of Broadway theater has been long and legendary, but the pressures of today’s sagging economy seem to be taking a toll on productions. But Larson remains optimistic.
“This is how it works. All these shows — 9 to 5, Shrek, Spamalot — they’re on tour. Yes, they leave Broadway, but they do have life post-production,” he said. “It’s always been the business of theater. Even yet, people are coming — even with the egregious amounts of money that they have to pay.”
 
Spamalot will be at the Pantages Theatre through March 4.

If you’ve dined in Los Angeles recently, there’s a good chance you’ve found some strange inclusions on menus.  Maybe you’ve spotted matzo ball soup, chicken and waffles or poutine.
That’s because these very specific comfort foods have been taken out of their homestyle contexts and given upscale updates.
Most prevalent in recent weeks has been the appearance of poutine. The name suggests a fanciful French-inspired dish. Or a gooey, throw-in-anything-you-can-find treat. Or maybe you rightly think of Canadian diner food.
Poutine, a Quebecois treasure featuring fries with gravy and cheese curds, is all those things.
The ever-expanding Umami Burger is currently serving an off-menu Poutine Burger for a limited time. Catch it while you can — it’s one of the chain’s popular truffle-drizzled patties atop a bed of cheesy fries. Its gravy is a mixture of a sweet mushroom sauce and burger juices. And the lack of a bun is a nice choice: The dish is plenty filling as is.
But the real wonder is that a recipe so connected to the culture of eastern Canada can feel so right in Los Angeles with a fusion of Japanese flavors and casual American sensibility.
And for those that wince at the thought of cheese curds, take comfort in knowing that pretty much any form of cheese suffices. Larchmont Village’s Larchmont Bungalow swaps out cheese curds for shredded mozzarella, which melts into strings and delectably wraps itself around the rest of the dish. But a crumbly, flavorful substitute of feta could provide the fries with more textural interest and an added tang as well.
Therein lies the beauty of a dish as free-form as poutine — any improvised recipe will do so long as it includes the three basic ingredients. This means at-home versions can be every bit as delicious as something you might find in a restaurant.
McDonalds’ fries are too thin to provide the hefty base the poutine needs, sulking under the weight of thick gravy. In-N-Out’s version will pose similar problems. Five Guys’ thick slices of potato are the way to go: Get them Cajun style to give your gravy some spice.
In the South, America celebrates the chicken and waffle tradition.
In this department, Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles has long sufficed for Angelenos. President Barack Obama ate there during a trip in October, giving the 37-year-old institution some national press.
Now, some L.A.-area restaurants have taken the odd-yet-brilliant combination of poultry and pastry one step further.
At Hollywood’s Wood and Vine, chicken and waffles is a favorite on the Southern-tilting brunch menu. But the waffles, hinting of vanilla bean and topped with chunks of butternut squash, ensure that this isn’t any old imitation of the Southern specialty. This is a glamorous remake only Hollywood is capable of.
The version at Zimzala in Huntington Beach’s Shorebreak Hotel comes as a gut-busting panini. Folded waffles serve as the bread with a variety of sandwich fillings like gruyère cheese and — as if the dish isn’t rich enough — prosciutto béchamel sauce. Here, the crispy creation is a dinner menu item sure to keep you full through the next day.
Similarly, matzo balls, the Jewish take on soup dumplings usually found at delis and Passover Seders, are becoming commonplace where you might least expect it.
The Gorbals, a Downtown restaurant with a constantly changing menu, is currently serving matzo balls wrapped in bacon. That’s not kosher, but it’s a clever combination that gives saltiness and chewiness to the dry density of the dumplings.
Trendy as ever, the restaurant is also featuring its own version of poutine, this one inspired by the Vietnamese banh mi sandwich, with stewed pork and pickled veggies.
But going back to the unsung matzo ball, its new iterations are tributes to its doughy versatility.
Take one of the city’s most celebrated dining spots, Lukshon. Tucked inside a narrow design complex in Culver City, Lukshon is easy to miss. But people flock here nonetheless for its Shanghai matzo-ball soup.
Sitting by the kitchen and watching bowl upon bowl of the soup being plated on a 75-degree day, I knew the unusual offering was a must-order. Matzo balls arrive as the soft pillows one always hopes for, and the inclusion of white sesame and bean sprouts provide a succinct Asian kick. It was like nothing I had tasted before, and yet it was evocative of so many memories of Passovers past.
Rediscovering poutine, on the other hand, brought me back to my first trip to Montreal at the age of 18. And the chicken and waffles, despite my first tasting the pairing in Los Angeles, transported me to my own imagined version of the Deep South, where everything’s delectably fried and no calorie is consequential.
Those memories — old, new, fictional — are what make these foods comforting no matter the form.

Larchmont Bungalow told council and the locals that they’re a furniture store. 
Operating without a restaurant permit for more than two years is what makes it illegal.
I’m educated enough by my parents to know that nothing good comes out of shadiness like that.
Larchmont Bungalow is an illegal restaurant. How eerie that you mention that place on the day of its criminal arraignment… 
It’s like when Heigl or some other actor shows up there every time they have an appearance in criminal court. 
USC students and celebrities are fond of spending money at illegal places like that, eh? Cool to support criminals, eh?
Larchmont Bungalow simply put tables and chairs out when their permit was for take-out only. “Spending money at illegal places like that…” You make it sound like it was a brothel or a crack house! Hahahaha… Relax dude!

Graduating seniors should rethink career-related entitlement. 
Somehow, February ran away from us, midterm season is here and the mild Los Angeles winter has broken into spring. Not far ahead, graduation stares the class of 2012 in the face.
Those of us planning to enter the workforce need to face the facts: We think we are worth more than we are.
The so-called millennial generation did not devise this idea itself. As we grew older, parents, coaches and friends told us we could do anything we wanted as long as we worked hard for it. At USC, we fraternize with distinguished professors and inspiring speakers who set our expectations high. Mentors help Trojans garble up internships and research positions. In many seniors’ minds, the next logical step in our achievement plans is to secure exciting jobs in our chosen fields, jobs that challenge us to take what we learned here — not to mention the $200,000 price tag — and apply it.
In reality, almost half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 took a job “just to pay the bills,” according to Pew Research Center’s 2011 study. Last year, young adults’ unemployment rate rose to 16.3 percent, almost double the national average and the highest since 1949.
Despite these facts, 91.7 percent of American grads expect to have a position within three to six months, according to an April 2011 study by I Love Rewards, a Cambridge-based research firm. The USC Career Center and Admissions Office could not confirm how many alumni have been employed within this time frame.
Even among employed alumni, some USC graduates have been surprised to find their work mundane and the totem pole staggering from the bottom.
Hearing similar statements from our generation as we enter the workforce, many business writers and psychologists have labeled us “entitled.”
I admit they have a point. Many of us demand that our potential be realized immediately when we should bust our butts to prove ourselves, even if that means doing menial work exceptionally well.
However, the class of 2012 should not abandon its entitlement completely. Instead, we should harness that entitlement to think big about our futures and apply to the best positions possible.
At the same time, we should deflate our egos and realize we might not secure these dream jobs.
When we do accept a position, whether exceptional or acceptable, we should do so with humility. Only then will others help us climb the ladder, though the ascent could take longer than we imagined.

Senior, communication 
I think Diana makes a great point in this well-written piece. Those who deny the truth in her argument may simply be too proud to admit to their flaws and only further prove her point. The graduates who will be the best-qualified for job positions come this May, will be those who are not only able to harness their strengths and exude confidence, but who are also able to admit to their weaknesses or imperfections and demonstrate a concentrated effort to improve upon them. Modesty is a great virtue, and although schools like USC imbue us with a certain air of entitlement, I think that most employers would take a well-qualified applicant who presents him or herself with humility over a hubris-filled braggart who refuses to accept a starting salary under 35 K a year. 
In case you’re still not convinced, read this NYU’s student’s cover letter that turned him into the “laughing-stock of Wall Street”:

Majoring in something legitimate greatly improves one’s job prospects.

The plan is a visionary one: a high-speed train running from San Francisco to Los Angeles, shortening the journey to two hours and 40 minutes of travel. This system, emulating the success of similar high-speed trains in Europe and Japan, is meant to make the commute between the two major Californian cities drastically easier — much easier than the daunting drive, much faster than the current rail options and much cheaper than flying.
The plan would usher a drastic shift in the way Northern and Southern California interact. In terms of business, the impact on transportation time and the growth of towns on the proposed route could be huge. A project of this magnitude would create thousands of jobs.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
But there lies the main challenge for the accomplishment of this ambitious goal: time.
Recent proposed changes might make time an even bigger hurdle than before.
California has set aside $98.5 billion for the system, a gargantuan, state-of-the-art set of tracks running up and down the state. The estimated completion date is around 2025. That leaves around 13 years for economic fluctuation, alternate projects and distraction to prevent the project from coming together as it was initially intended.
The state has already dedicated $9 billion to the program; the idea was to gradually use $2.7 billion over the next few years on a 130-mile segment in the Central Valley.
Even in the early stages of the process, diversions are already becoming a concern.
On Feb. 19, the Los Angeles Times reported that various transportation agencies have proposed to draw an additional $4 billion from that fund to begin upgrading the pre-existing rail systems in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The agencies want to adjust the rails to make them compatible with high-speed trains and older trains, such as Metrolink and Amtrak.
Proponents of this system make a strong argument. By developing these urban bookends for the eventual system, the agencies would assure improvements coming out of the funds that have already been allotted, in case the overall plan succumbs to the many pitfalls it could encounter along the way.
Proponents need to be wary of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. Though it is in the interest of securing a positive result, this shift creates the kind of distraction that could ultimately cause a project like this to fall apart. The project could undermine itself if it sets a precedent of diverting from the original plan for short-term benefits.
Undergoing a long-term project like this one is risky. Beyond the inevitable chaos that such an extended project will have to endure, the sheer amount of money involved makes people nervous.
No one wants to be held responsible for the high-speed rail to nowhere; no one wants to explain where billions of dollars went in a press conference. Circumstances are stacked against something of this magnitude, and one would imagine the politicians involved are wary of trusting it blindly.
Yet this project has the potential to be great for the state of California, and it should be given a real chance to succeed. It remains to be seen if hedging against potential failure will become a trend — and the proponents of these urban bookends are risking just that.

“Yet this project has the potential to be great for the state of California, and it should be given a real chance to succeed.”
There is no empirical data to show that High Speed Rail is a possibility in California without MASSIVE subsidies from tax payers. 
1) We have a very mobile population – more than one million people left CA in the past 10 years.
2) Our most dense cities are all in the Bay Area – this is why BART works
3) Of all the High Speed Rail projects world wide, only two are financially sustainable – France (many walled cities = dense population centers) & Japan (an island = dense population centers)
4) Cost of land – SF & LA have VERY high land costs – the costs of a system will balloon as the taxpayers have to reimburse people for their land
5) Environmental concerns – Noise pollution, massive carbon expenditures to make track and train cars
6) Cost of running the system – electrical power to energize the tracks, union wages for operators, & pensions for workers
7) Cost of money to build the system – money is cheap now, but we will roll over bonds again and again to pay for a non-profit money sink
8) Only the rich will benefit – even with infusions of cash from tax payers the cost of each ticket will be near to the cost of taking an airplane
9) Terrorist target – we will need airport-like security for the entire length of the track to keep terrorists from attacking
What should we do?
1) Cut our losses. Pay the dreamers that thought up the idea and shelf it to sell to a private company to develop.
2) Build a virtual high speed rail. Make a new movie every year and sell it to airlines to show during flights to the Bay Area and back.
First of all, California does not have $98,000,500,000 dollars to spend. It is a typical accounting trick used by politicians, in particular Jerry Brown. His proposal calls for carbon credits to fund the project. There is no real money. The state of California is fundamentally broke, not to mention the United States. 
Amtrak has never made a dime in it’s history. For every passenger it carries, it looses roughly $47.00. All subsidized by the tax payer. Joe Biden likes it, because he uses it. 
what percentage of passengers does HSR expect to garner from air transportation, 50% 70%? How will that effect our air transportation system? HSR will be subsidized for ever,  with tax payer money. It will never be able to stand on it’s own. We are not Tokyo, how many people are actually going to use this system, to travel between San Fransisco and LA/San Diego,.as opposed to air travel. 
The politicians in Sacramento  already lied about the amounts of money involved, what makes anyone think the lies will not continue. 
Safety is another issue. I certainly hope it never happens, but it seems inevitable that a collision between the HSR and a vehicle or other object will occur eventually. What then? 
Why do the politicians in Sacramento and elsewhere insist on wanting to turn the US into a European style country.

Last week, I talked about editing. This week, we’re going to take a closer look at editing software.
Every day, editing software is coming further and further in what it can do, and how fast it can do it.  Most people are familiar with the most expensive programs—such as Final Cut Pro and Adobe CS—but many free and cheaper options also exist.
For starters, both Macs and PCs come with free editing programs.  For Macs, it’s iMovie, and for PC users, it’s Window Live Movie Maker.  With both of these programs (and most editing software), you’ll find three main components: a bin, a timeline and a preview.  The bin is where you keep all of your various video files.  The timeline is where all your clips are blended and put together.  And the preview is the small screen where you can watch what you’ve put together in time line.
Some of the most common things you’ll be using editing software for are trimming clips, adding transitions and tweaking sounds.  Of course, editing software has countless more uses than this.
More expensive editing software usually runs at least $300, but many more features are available.  These features include auto-organization of media, the ability to assemble multi-cam projects and many others.
The software programs I’ve listed are just a few of the many options for video editing.  A huge number of free or very cheap editing software is available online, with new programs being created all the time.  Whatever program you decide to use, it’s a good idea to stick with the same program so you completely understand the program.  A good editor needs good software, and the editing process is very important to the success of your film.
