Before he murdered 11 innocent people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh last week, Robert Gregory Bowers shouted: “All Jews must die!” 
The shooting is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in United States history, demonstrating a need for the nation — especially young people — to band together against anti-Semitic attacks.
Closer to USC, the Beth Jacob temple in Irvine was vandalized last Wednesday. The vandals, who have yet to be apprehended, spray painted the words “Fuck Jews” on the side of the temple, just days after the Pittsburgh attack.
Anti-Semitic crimes are all too common across the United States and take up far too many pages of our history books. 
According to the FBI, Jewish people make up less than 3 percent of the total United States population, but of all religiously motivated hate crimes, over half are committed against the Jewish community.
The slaughter of Jews during the Christian Crusades, the burning of Jews during the Spanish Inquisition, the pogroms against Jews in 19th and 20th century Russia and the genocide of six million Jews at the hands of the Nazi Party are just some of the many instances of anti-Semitism that stain the pages of human history. 
In 2018, anti-Semitism has once again reared its ugly head.
People cannot simply stand by and watch their Jewish brothers and sisters once again become victims of those who subscribe to this ancient and vile form of bigotry. 
To defend these people of around 15 million, it is crucial to be honest about why this tiny ethno-religious community has been consistently and virulently met with violence and persecution.
Religion, particularly stemming from Judaism’s daughter religions Christianity and Islam, is largely to blame for the piles of dead bodies left behind because of anti-Semitic movements throughout human history. 
The man who committed the synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh last week was an avid social media user. Bowers frequented the social media website Gab, which is popular among those on the far right. His Gab account description read “Jews are the children of Satan (John 8:44). The Lord Jesus Christ [has] come in the flesh.” 
Many Christian scholars have denounced Bowers’ interpretation of the verse, but his use of scripture as justification for committing an atrocity against the Jewish people is just one of many examples. One of the Nazi Party’s favorite biblical passages was Matthew 27:25, which reads: “All the [Jews] answered, ‘[Jesus’s] blood is on us and on our children!’” This passage echoes the long-held belief among Catholic clergy members that the Jews were collectively guilty of “killing Jesus.”
In Islam, anti-Semitic propaganda is produced daily and justified by their holy books. Quran 2:61 states that the Jews “disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.” 
Many Islamic political factions in the Middle East are also blatantly anti-Semitic. For example, Hamas is an Islamofascist political party that is currently in control of the Gaza Strip. The group is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood and is an explicitly Islamic organization. Hamas says in Article 7 of its charter that “‘The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims fight Jews and kill them.”
The problem with anti-Semitism is vast and deeply complex. To blame any single factor for such a large issue would be extremely reductionist and ignorant. That said, however, not recognizing the huge role religious belief plays in anti-Semitism would be equally ignorant. 
Religious dogma has led to the deaths of an unimaginable number of men, women and children, and anti-Semitism is largely rooted in it.
If society is to end anti-Semitism for good it must destroy its root and stem. Generation Z must be the one to reject religious dogma as a societal norm and embrace the values of the Enlightenment and humanism. Religious ideology should be treated with suspicion and criticism, and all people should be treated with empathy and dignity.
The tragedy at the Pittsburgh synagogue last week prematurely ended the lives of 11 individuals for the “crime” of being Jewish. 
It’s high time to stop spilling blood over dogmas rooted in century-old myths, and Generation Z ought to lead the charge against it.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Gab, the social media platform used by the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting suspect, has resurfaced online roughly a week after domain registrar GoDaddy dropped its site. 
The platform is reported to be a haven for neo-Nazis and white nationalists who have been banned from the likes of Facebook and Twitter for hate speech and harassment. 
Gab’s existence — or the existence of a site like it — should come as no surprise. 
As mainstream platforms grow more stringent in monitoring offensive content and predatory behavior, these repressed hateful and conspiratorial ideas do not just dissipate into thin air. The platform might have been briefly stopped following a violent incident that shook the nation, but the extremism and niche political beliefs it breeds continue to exist in the dark corners of cyberspace.
Extremism in any form is a threat to democracy, and it has only become more prevalent in the current political atmosphere. 
Platforms like Gab have allowed for radical niche groups to coalesce and grow in social power, and the frightening aspect is that these ideas have become easily accessible to any person browsing online who happens upon them.

It’s crucial that law enforcement officials, politicians and teachers recognize this threat and actively work to combat it — not by proactively inhibiting radical speech and ideas, but by monitoring it and educating citizens about its potential dangers and how to avoid them.
In a recent POLITICO article, Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group and a counterterrorism expert, noted that the rise of far-right ideologies online resembles the rise of ISIS on social media. Yet, the Department of Homeland Security withheld grant money in June 2017 from individuals who planned to study and help individuals radicalized by online extremism, according to a New York Times report. 
At the federal level, it appears that white nationalism and right-wing fringe movements might not be perceived as pertinent of a threat as, say, Islamic extremism. This is a mistake by law enforcement officials: In refusing to recognize these extremist movements for what they are, they are enabling this web of activity to grow unchecked, while remaining ignorant of their potentially violent motives. 
Politicians have also previously taken issue with the words “right-wing extremism,” forcing the DHS to retract a 2009 study on the movement, labeling the report a partisan act. The department had published reports about left-wing extremism, but there had been no objection to that terminology, according to the Times article. 
Beyond partisanship, politicians on both sides of the aisle must come together to recognize the threat online extremism has brought on national security and denounce such extremist movements. 
Local elected and law enforcement officials should be aware of such content in their communities. 
This is crucial especially after incidents such as the Charlottesville white nationalist rally and more recently, the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. While federal agencies have the breadth and depth of resources to monitor large-scale national threats, local officials have a much smaller jurisdiction to oversee in tracking hate crimes and violence toward specific groups of people. 
While hate speech and harassment on the internet do not always result in physical violence, these ideas still hold dangerous consequences. 
Every day, unwitting internet browsers could happen upon extremist ideas and become ideologically recruited, and it’s imperative that educators and politicians keep this in mind while crafting curriculum for students growing up in the digital age. 
Combating extremism requires digital literacy, skills that children often might not be taught when parents give them their first smartphone or personal computer. Educators and parents must realize that these tools, while handy and necessary for students’ learning, pose nefarious risks.
The Center for Public Integrity reported that white nationalist groups like The Proud Boys and Identity Evropa heavily target young white men for recruitment into their ranks, posing as a social fraternity-like group. NPR also reported that right-wing hate groups are recruiting video gamers, and the Charlottesville Unite the Right rally was planned over Discord, a chat app typically used by video gamers.
It’s impossible to fully monitor and prevent these groups’ recruitment activity without denying them their First Amendment rights, but educators and law enforcement officials must ensure that local citizens are aware of the ideological threats that these groups pose on the internet. 
Something as simple as parenting or digital literacy courses could be a significant step forward in ensuring that parents are aware of the content their children can find online. 
Online extremism has yet to be fully understood by counterterrorism experts and even federal law enforcement agencies, but there’s one thing we know for sure: The internet is not going away, and neither are these extremist groups. It’s crucial that our country is prepared, rather than fall back on the regulatory frameworks of mainstream social platforms.

A taste of home · Wilson Salguero opened Caveman Kitchen in 2007 and watched it survive through the Great Recession. Combining Peruvian and Cuban cuisines, Salguero aimed to bring foods he grew up eating to South L.A., like the saltados (pictured) and burgers. (Kanak Kapur | Daily Trojan)
Every part of Wilson Salguero’s restaurant was built with intention and consideration. 
The Caveman Kitchen owner sits with his hands folded on a table that he built and painted himself, examining the colorful wooden boards he constructed that run the interior of the restaurant’s walls. 
The simple touches of the restaurant’s decorations, illustrations by local artists and the menu itself are inspired by Salguero’s Latin American roots and his desire to go back to basics. 
It’s easy to find something to love about Caveman Kitchen for students, neighborhood residents or cops on a lunch break. Customers can enjoy the unique bamboo ornaments on the restaurant’s windows as they eat lomo saltado — a Peruvian dish that consists of ribeye steak, fries, tomatoes, onions, rice and Salguero’s  famous “green heat sauce.”
By incorporating a caveman-like theme throughout the restaurant’s dishes, Salguero wants his patrons to go back to the simple aspects of the food they enjoy, particularly in the chicken rotisserie over premium firewood dish for which his joint is famous.
“There is a theory that there was a bird on a tree and some lightning hit it,” Salguero said. “[That’s how] man discovered fire and …  how the rotisserie chicken came about. We started eating the way we were meant to eat: more natural and healthy.”
Kanak Kapur | Daily Trojan
Salguero, who is from El Salvador, grew up in Koreatown before moving closer to USC, which his best friend attended. His familiarity with the neighborhood led him to open a restaurant on Vermont Avenue. 
“This is my neighborhood,” Salguero said. “What’s beautiful about my restaurant is I think it attracts everybody … it’s a nice mix of different people.”
Salguero’s past with and commitment to flavor diversity run through the restaurant’s eclectic menu, which features mixed recipes inspired by his Salvadoran roots with Peruvian and Cuban influences.
“Most of the dishes that you see here are basically something that I grew up eating that I love,” Salguero said. 
Salguero moved to South L.A. with the goal of bringing great food to the area, but the journey was not easy. 
He had to build the restaurant from the ground up in an empty lot, and in 2007 — a year after the restaurant opened — the Great Recession hit. 
Right as Caveman Kitchen started attracting more business, ingredients became more expensive and customers began losing their jobs, so they didn’t spend as much, Salguero recounted. The restaurant struggled through its first three years, but finally made its mark.
According to Salguero, what kept him going was his vision for his restaurant — a place where the ingredients were natural and high-quality.
“I started with the idea … that it was going to be rotisserie chicken — fresh, something wholesome, nothing fried — and fresh-made hamburgers — quality beef, fresh patties,” he said. “[This was] complemented with fresh cut fries, instead of those cold, frozen, processed french fries.”
Salguero emphasized that the chicken was quite literally the heart of the operation: In fact, the first thing that he placed in the restaurant was the rotisserie. 
After setting it down, it was too heavy to move, so he designed the rest of the establishment around it. 
His focus on chicken shines with the Cave Club Sandwich, where the shredded meat is arranged on an artisan burger bun and served with freshly cut fries. The tender chicken complements the  savory bacon, melted Swiss cheese, mayo, lettuce, tomato and onion. Other dishes Salguero added to the menu display his creativity, and he sees the reason behind his ambition as simple: his passion for food. 
“I love food, and why not pass on good food?” Salguero said. “If I can deliver good food, then let’s do it.”

“Where did you get those?” “Those are fresh.” “Did you just see who that was?” All of these questions and more echoed throughout the Long Beach Convention Center last weekend. On Saturday and Sunday, hypebeasts and hip-hop fans alike flocked to the venue for the third annual iteration of ComplexCon.
The convention was hosted and curated by producer Pharrell Williams and Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. Williams, a mogul in the music and streetwear industries, helped secure the diverse lineup of hip-hop performances and vendors for the occasion. Murakami, father of the art world’s “superflat” movement, decorated the venue with his trademark characters and figures.
Perhaps ComplexCon’s biggest draw is the close proximity that fans, buyers and Complex readers had to their favorite brands, artists and creatives. Inside, there was little to distinguish between attendees and performers or buyers and vendors. As far as fashion, every shade and style of expensive streetwear was on full display. As well, there was no shortage of surprise appearances within the sprawl of booths as artists and fans browsed side-by-side.
On Saturday, Williams and Chad Hugo of N.E.R.D and The Neptunes stopped by the BBC ICECREAM booth to celebrate its 15th anniversary. For this special occasion, the brand released merchandise and collaborations exclusive to ComplexCon, and unsurprisingly produced a line that stretched several city blocks.  
In fact, outside of the setting and context, one might mistake the featured kiosks’ and brands’ extensive queues for Thursday release days on Fairfax Avenue. 
Among the convention center floor surprise appearances were actor Michael B. Jordan and the cast of “Creed II,” who participated in a Q&A hosted by BET’s Terrence J. For this, Jordan and the rest of the cast circled a pop-up boxing ring hidden within the rows of vendors. As well, NBA legend Allen Iverson debuted his first sneakers in over four years: the I3 Legacy from Reebok.
One hour prior to participating in his “Complex Conversation,” hip-hop artist Vince Staples mingled with friends and fans at his merchandise kiosk in the convention center’s warehouse. Promoting his new album “FM!” which was released Friday, the Long Beach native greeted and took pictures with eager fans.
The weekend’s “Complex Conversations” series merged leading figures in sports, music, media and fashion for sit-down panel conversations on a variety of topics. The Atlantic’s Jemele Hill and former NFL wide receiver Victor Cruz kicked off Saturday with a conversation about whether Michael Jordan or Allen Iverson has the greater impact on today’s sneaker culture. As well, brothers Tommy and Andy Hilfiger joined Complex’s Lewis Hamilton for a roundtable discussion on the brand’s legacy in hip-hop.
Yet, the day’s most anticipated conversation was between Vince Staples and a Long Beach legend, whose identity was kept secret until the panel — he turned out to be none other than rapper Snoop Dogg himself. 
The straight-edge, quick-witted Staples and hip-hop’s stoner uncle Snoop could not have more different personalities, but the two took pride in their shared experiences growing up in the north side of Long Beach. In fact, Staples and Snoop quickly bonded over the fact that Staples was a product of the youth football league Snoop established. The pair also emphasized the importance of paying respects and giving back to one’s hometown.
As a whole, the festival provided an intimate gathering for the intersection fashion, music, art and pop culture. However, the lack of affordable vendors was disappointing, as it felt like a key part of the experience was acquiring exclusive, pricey merchandise. Judging by the near-perfect curation on behalf of Murakami and Williams, as well as the seamless interactions between convention goers and creatives, ComplexCon should continue to grow as a unique addition to the West Coast’s convention circuit.

Junior guard Minyon Moore sets up a play last season. Her sister, Mariya, will be eligible to play this year after sitting out as a transfer from Louisville. (Sunny Dong | Daily Trojan)
Women’s basketball will kick off its season against UC Riverside Nov. 6 at 5 p.m. at the Galen Center.
 For a team that finished seventh in the Pac-12 last year, the Women of Troy enter the 2018 season with a lot to prove. They are coming off of a 20-win campaign, ending the season with a 9-9 record in conference play.
The Trojans bring back a strong veteran presence, as well some new faces this season. They will return two starters in senior guard Aliyah Mazych and junior guard Minyon Moore. As for the newcomers, USC will introduce freshmen forwards Jillian Archer and Desiree Caldwell. 
There are many questions as to how the Trojans will do this season after the losses of star forward Kristen Simon and guard Jordan Adams, who started all 31 games for the Trojans last season, but the six new players on the roster will look to fill the void. 
Mazych was part of the Pac-12 All-Defensive Team last year. In 2017, she made a USC single-season record 86 3-pointers, which moved her up to No. 8 all-time in career 3-pointers. In addition, Mazych was one of the main reasons that head coach Mark Trakh was able to have a 20-win season in his first season back at USC, as she played a total of 1,083 minutes. Mazych is expected to show her veteran leadership this season. 
One of the most interesting players to keep an eye on this season, will be fellow senior Mariya Moore, who is in her first season at USC. Moore, a transfer from Louisville, sat out her first season with USC last year after previously playing three full seasons in a Cardinal uniform. She finished her sophomore season having started 32 of 34 games and ranking fifth in assists per game in the ACC. Moore found her way into Louisville’s top-10 single season lists in 3-pointers and free throws. Mariya’s junior sister, Minyon, has been at USC since freshman year. 
Furthermore, the Trojans also have high expectations for true freshmen Archer and Caldwell. Archer, the 6-foot-2 forward out of Santa Monica comes to USC after a successful high school career where she was an All-CIF first team selection and CIF Player of the Year honorable mention. 
Caldwell, the 5-foot-8 guard from San Antonio, Texas, was heavily recruited in high school. A member of the USA Basketball U18 Team, Caldwell won a gold medal at the 2018 FIBA U18 World Championships, an exclamation point to her dominant pre-college career. 
Trakh enters his second season with the team. Previously coaching the Trojans between 2005-2009, he led the team to two NCAA tournaments, making it to the second round in both trips. Trakh is now looking to make it three NCAA tournament appearances as head coach for the Trojans, a feat that could be reached this season.
Coming into this new season, the Trojans have more depth than they have had in previous seasons. For a team that did not live up to expectations last season, Trakh will look to take advantage of having more options in his roster this year to make it to their first NCAA tournament since 2014. The Trojans will face the nation’s best in the Pac-12 this season, including Oregon, Stanford and UCLA.

USC men’s basketball starts the 2018-19 season Tuesday with a home matchup against Robert Morris 8 p.m. This is the first of three straight home games to open the season against lesser competition, so the Trojans will look to take advantage of the opportunity for a strong start.
The Trojans, who went 24-12 and made the Pac-12 Tournament Championship game last year, will be tasked with replacing their leading scorer and rebounder in forward Chimezie Metu and their leading assist man in guard Jordan McLaughlin. With both departed for the NBA, along with the program’s all-time 3-pointer leader in guard Elijah Stewart, the Trojans have big shoes to fill.
Despite this, USC still retains a measure of the depth that made it successful last year. They return six players who played double-digit minutes in 2017-18, and junior guard Jonah Mathews said that the Trojans will once again have a varied attack.
“Everybody on the team can score,” said Mathews at Pac-12 Media Day in October. “I think we have one of the most talented offensive teams in the nation, from top to bottom.”
Head coach Andy Enfield has put an emphasis on executing on defense. 
“[We are] making sure our opponent doesn’t score 70 points, because last year [when we played an] opponent that didn’t score 70 points, we won the game,” redshirt senior guard Shaqquan Aaron said.
If there is a star for this team, it’s senior forward Bennie Boatwright. Boatwright was the team’s second-leading scorer last season, and is a potential all-conference selection candidate. He was also named to the preseason watch list for the Malone award for the nation’s best power forward and for the Naismith Trophy, which is awarded to the top collegiate basketball player. Boatwright missed the end of last season due to a knee injury and has spent the off season recovering. According to Enfield, Boatwright will be a gametime decision on Tuesday night. 
“I think Bennie is very determined this year to come back and have a tremendous senior season,” Enfield said of Boatwright in an interview with Pac-12. “He puts a lot of time and effort  in.”

A key factor that will determine the Trojans’ success is point guard play, as McLaughlin led the conference in assists last season. His calming presence will be replaced by redshirt junior Derryck Thornton, a five-star recruit out of high school in his second season with USC after transferring from Duke.
“This summer, I got in the gym, I worked on my shooting a ton,” said Thornton per USC Athletics, adding that he learned a lot from McLaughlin last year. “I have been watching a lot of film, breaking down great point guards and seeing how I can learn and get better.”
The Trojans’ rotations have yet to be determined, mostly due to a talented freshman class that will compete for minutes. Guard Kevin Porter Jr. highlights the group; the Washington product is the best candidate of the incomers to start right away due to his athleticism and shot-making ability. Porter’s talent has earned buzz that he can go one-and-done and be a first round pick in the NBA draft.
Freshman forward J’Raan Brooks should also see significant playing time because of USC’s lack of frontcourt depth. 
The wild card is guard Elijah Weaver, who has been out with an ankle surgery since late August. When he returns, Weaver should step in as the backup point guard to Thornton. Weaver is apparently ahead of schedule and is expected to return in the next few weeks.
“You know, [injuries] happen,” Aaron said. “It’s part of the game. Now we’re all … pretty much all healthy and back. The days that we’ve had all together we’ve prepared, gone at it hard, and we’ll be ready for [tonight].”
Robert Morris also needs to replace production after losing leading scorer Dachon Burke. They do, however, return their other four starters, including leading assist man in sophomore guard Jon Williams and their second-leading scorer in sophomore forward Koby Thomas.
The Colonials struggled as a team last year. They don’t shoot the lights out, grab every rebound or defend incredibly well. Their per game numbers were pretty similar to their opponents’ in most statistical categories, such as their 68.8 points per game and .411 field goal percentage compared to their opponents’ 70.7 and .448. They went 16-17 on the year and had a scoring margin of -1.9, so they tended to keep games pretty close.
Thomas was also the team’s leading rebounder, despite being listed at 6-foot-6 and 190 pounds. With Rakocevic and Boatwright both over 6-foot-10, USC will have a significant size advantage that it should be able to exploit.
Prediction: 88-66
The Trojans shouldn’t have any issues winning this game comfortably. The Colonials are not from a Power Five conference; they don’t have the talent USC has and lack the star production necessary to make up for the overall disparity. If the Trojans lose this game, they’ll have the answers to the questions the team has this season, they just won’t be the ones the team wants.

Penny Hardaway should have four NBA titles by now. Bo Jackson could have been hands-down the greatest athlete who ever lived. And I could have made my high school baseball team had it not been for the fact that I was competing with the future No. 1 overall pick Mickey Moniak. 
Every team and every player has potential to be the greatest, but only some achieve it. This year’s USC men’s basketball team has that same potential to win the national title. 
By now blue bloods like UCLA and Arizona have probably lost their voices from laughter, and I’m okay with that. This USC team has been the most slept on team for years, and I am sick of people claiming this isn’t a basketball school. Yes, football is, and always will be, USC’s sport; but that doesn’t mean that sports like basketball don’t matter or won’t do well. 
Aside from a complete snub by the NCAA tournament committee last year, this squad has turned itself into one of the top teams in the Pac-12. Thanks to expert recruiting and coaching from head coach Andy Enfield, this team has potential even without stars Elijah Stewart, Jordan McLaughlin, De’Anthony Melton and Chimezie Metu. 
The lineup, much like my candy bag after Halloween, is loaded, and I’m expecting a king-size payday (not the confusing peanut amalgamation, but a national title).
Starting at forward is senior 3-point splasher senior Bennie Boatwright and junior 2-point slasher Nick Rakocevic. While Boatwright has always been an NBA quality player with his scoring abilities, Rakocevic has transitioned from a lanky, foul-heavy rebounder to a premiere post presence. 
Rakocevic hit nearly two out of three of his shots last year and scored 48 points in his final three games, including an unreal 24-point, 19-rebound performance against UNC Asheville in the first round of the NIT tournament, thanks to recently-added interior box outs, hesitations and ball fakes that made me wonder if the Chicago native had gotten hold of Michael’s secret juice from “Space Jam.”
Aside from the two bigs, USC guards are ready to explode and have been waiting years for an opportunity to show everyone what made them so good in high school. 
Second-year starter and junior Jonah Matthews, fifth-year role player Shaqquan Aaron, lightning bug sophomore Jordan Usher and former Duke starter redshirt junior Derryck Thornton all have the potential to make this team one of the best kept secrets in college basketball.
Last year, the collection shined in moments here or there. But given the presence of seniors McLaughlin and Stewart, they were often seen as secondary players, chipping in when they could.
After a full season of development behind two NBA-quality shooters, these kids are prepared to shine the way their talent should. Matthews is a shooting and defensive wizard with huge upside. Thornton is as sure handed as McLaughlin, with an even better take to the rack. Lanky and deadly when he gets hot, Aaron is the second coming of Kobe Bryant. And Usher, a linebacker converted to a tweener sharp-shooter, is as competitive as anyone and simply does not quit. 
And those freshmen? Don’t even get me started. I could go on all day long telling you how guard Kevin Porter Jr. will be a lottery pick some day, how forward J’Raan Brooks will dunk all over UCLA and how guard Elijah Weaver will force more turnovers than Porto’s bakery, but it would serve no purpose because many people don’t believe in potential. 
Nobody ever does. 
People will see this year’s injury-plagued team as a squad that could be. I see them as a team that will be, because once this team gets healthy – and they will – they’re going to win some ball games. 
After all, who’s stopping them? Robert Morris Tuesday? Stetson on Friday night? 
Aside from games against Nevada and TCU, the Trojans could easily go undefeated in non-conference play, much like they did only a few seasons ago. 
Although Election Day will overshadow Tuesday’s home opener, I will not stop campaigning for this team. I’ve already put signs on my lawn, buttons on my backpack and bumper stickers on my Prius. They’ve already earned my vote. What’s stopping you?

Bennie Boatwright has never turned down a workout.
Even now, as a senior, the men’s basketball captain will prove to his father, Bennie Boatwright Sr., that he is working out — even late on a Friday.
“It’s a Friday night. Everybody’s out doing their thing,” Bennie Sr. will say.
“Dad, you don’t think I’m lying?” Boatwright will respond, with a picture of the gym where he is working out. 
Boatwright’s efforts are indicators of a work ethic that he has exhibited since childhood, one that he continues to carry as he enters the final season of his college career, hoping to rebound from a serious knee injury that has kept him from game action since February. 
The injury relegated him to watching from the bench last season as the Trojans were fleeced of a spot in March Madness before bowing out early in the NIT Tournament. It also denied him the chance to declare for the NBA Draft.
“[NBA teams] are going to question your durability,” he said. “I want to come back … and have a healthy season.” 
Boatwright is itching to be back, to lead his team as the veteran most likely to be drafted next summer.
“I haven’t played in so long. I go back and watch my own film to remind myself how I played,” Boatwright said. “It got to that point.” 
When healthy, Boatwright was one of 50 college players named to the preseason Naismith Trophy watchlist for the nation’s top player. He is the type of athlete today’s NBA coaches drool over. He is 6-foot-10 with range, a solid 3-point shot, the ability to put the ball on the floor and a much-improved defender from his freshman year.
“If he has a good senior year, he’ll be a first round pick easily,” Bennie Sr. said. 
But to head coach Andy Enfield, the NBA is not the focus — “We don’t even discuss the NBA.”
Instead the discussion is focused on Nov. 6: the night USC opens its season against Robert Morris at Galen Center. For Enfield, Boatwright needs to get his timing back, needs to play in a game before any discussion about the future.

Work ethic
Boatwright grew up in Mission Hills, just 50 miles north of USC. His father, now retired, was a cop working at the Los Angeles Police Department for 34 years. 
Boatwright would work around Bennie Sr.’s schedule to get shots in, whether that was 6 a.m. at the park, 2 a.m. at the police academy’s court or at midnight in the family’s backyard — neighbors be damned.
“They started calling the police on us,” Boatwright said. “So we had to stop [shooting] super late.” 
But he still shot, and shot a lot – 500 to 1,000 times a day. Form shots, one-dribble pull-up jumpers, holding the follow through. Again and again and again.
“You’re not going to shoot three times a week,” Bennie Sr. said, “and expect to be good.” 
Marcus Lovett, who trained Boatwright from when he was just nine years old, said Boatwright’s worth ethic from an early age allowed him to be pushed to the limit.
“I’ve never had Bennie object to anything since I’ve ever known him,” Lovett said. 
There’s also the physical aspect: the part that nobody can teach. 
When Lovett first met him, Boatwright was already bigger, faster and better than the rest of the kids. By his teenage years, Boatwright was 5-foot-11. For Lovett, Boatwright was a can’t-miss prospect.
“When you get to the pros, they’ll teach you the other stuff,” Lovett said. “Your height, which you can’t teach, and that stroke – you either have it or you don’t.” 
Alex Parker, who became on of Boatwright’s mentors as a child, also worked with current NBA veteran Trevor Ariza.
“I just could tell by [Boatwright’s] body movement he was going to be special,” Parker said. “He had a natural touch.” 
Choosing USC
Boatwright starred at Village Christian High School and  had a fair number of offers from big-time colleges:  Arizona, UCLAand Kansas, just to name a few. 
And then there was USC: a then-fledgling program in Enfield’s first season as head coach.
“Bennie took a chance to come to a program where he thought the players that came in together could make a difference, and he certainly has,” Enfield said. 
Enfield landed what turned out to be a stellar recruiting class – Boatwright, along with Jordan McLaughlin, Elijah Stewart and Chimezie Metu, a quartet that led USC to two straight NCAA tournament appearances.
Associate headcoach Jason Hart, who played a crucial role in recruiting Boatwright, said he knew Boatwright wanted to stay close to family in Los Angeles. He kept in touch with Boatwright through high school, and made a case that the forward could come in to USC and play right away.
“He could’ve easily went to UCLA,” Hart said. “We just built a better relationship with him and he felt comfortable over here.”

Boatwright said he was drawn in by Hart’s honesty. He “kept it real” and never promised anything.
“At the time, we were a bad basketball program,” Hart said. “The pitch was you can come here, create your own legacy, create your own mark.” 
Boatwright also wanted to build a program from the ground up as opposed to joining an already-established team. The forward has started all three seasons — an opportunity he likely would not have gotten at UCLA or Kansas.
“That’s a lot more pleasing than going to a program that’s already at the top,” Boatwright said. “It feels good to build it from the bottom. I enjoy the challenge.” 
Building the Program
When Boatwright first arrived at USC, he wanted to just launch jumpers.
“Just coming in and being all about scoring, scoring, scoring,” he said. “That was the only thing I wanted to do: score.” 
But before his sophomore year, he was elected team captain. And he knew there had to be a change in his mentality.
“Coming in next year, trying to win,” he said emphatically, “Trying to win, win, win.” 
McLaughlin, who is now in the G-League after four years running the point at USC, said Boatwright’s mindset isn’t uncommon among younger players.
“When you come into a new spot, you’re one of top players on your high school team,” he said. “I think he really learned that when he got with us that everybody is just as good as you.” 
Boatwright learned under Enfield’s system that the team’s tactics revolved around sharing the basketball and being multidimensional, a now-proven strategy with USC leading the Pac-12 in assists last season.
“It’s important in our system and philosophy to share the basketball, to make the extra pass, create for your teammates,” Enfield said. “Bennie has done a good job of elevating his game where he can not only shoot the perimeter jump shot but put the ball on the floor. He can post up and get to the foul line.” 
Along with his on-court skill, Boatwright has become more mature. Hart said that Boatwright used to become irritated easily.
“Now he knows. He’s mature enough that it’s not personal,” Hart said. “He’s accepted coaches and understands defenses as well now.” 
Leadership
When asked if he could recall the moment he knew he was good at basketball, Boatwright’s confidence emerged.
“I feel like I’m better than anybody I play against,” he said. 
It’s a side of the usually reserved Boatwright that comes through when he’s on the hardwood.
“Bennie’s super cool, super laid back — except when he’s on the court,” said junior guard and fellow captain Jonah Mathews. “When’s he on the court, he’s super serious.” 
The only thing that has kept Boatwright from reaching his full potential has been injuries.
Boatwright has had recurring knee problems; he missed 17 games his sophomore season and the final nine games of last season. But that hasn’t stopped him from being a leader, according to his teammates.
“He helps some of our younger guys,” said redshirt junior guard Derryck Thornton. “When they’re doing something wrong, he pulls them aside and shows them the ropes.” 
Redshirt senior guard Shaqquan Aaron added that Boatwright doesn’t act like he’s injured, still getting shots up and working out.
“That makes other guys, if they were to get hurt, be like man, ‘I see Bennie hurt shooting jumpers, so I’m going to do the same thing,’” Aaron said. 
Case in point: during a intrasquad scrimmage in October in front of donors at the Galen Center practice court, Boatwright took advantage of every timeout to get up shots. Dressed in a full uniform despite not participating in the scrimmage, he conversed with donors, showing them his injured left knee.
He looked like he badly wanted to play, like he didn’t want to be confined to the bench. 
But the recovery is all part of the process, as Bennie Sr. calls it — a process filled with repetition, of not letting the negatives get to you and of being consistent. These are values Bennie Sr. learned from over three decades in LAPD, ones that he has now passed on to his son.
“When he was born,” Bennie Sr. said, “the process started.” 
The process took Boatwright through early morning and late night workouts as a kid, a stellar high school career and a scholarship at USC. Now, the process is at a crossroads, the biggest of his career to date. 
The NBA is on the other side, but first, he has to prove his health and his worth on the court. His status for the home opener on Tuesday is still up in the air.
“It’s going to be close,” Enfield said last week. 
With his injury, Boatwright has spent a lot of time on his own the last eight months. 
It’s been therapeutic for him ever since he’s gotten over the initial shock of the injury. He’s become more patient, learning more about himself and not planning on returning to the court until he feels 100 percent.
“I’m appreciative of that,” Boatwright said. “Of course, I am dying to get on the court. I really do want to get on the court.”

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the experience of being a woman. Due in part to conversations circulating in the social justice sphere and my “Gender, Media and Communication” course, topics of identity and femininity have been on my mind often this semester. 
I recently emerged from another Sylvia Plath phase, spontaneously purchased Barbara Kruger postcards for my room and spent an afternoon watching Ruth Bader Ginsburg interviews and documentaries. To top it all off, by a stroke of luck and whim, I attended The Wrap’s first annual Power Women Summit last Friday and heard from dozens of female powerhouses in the media and entertainment industry. 
The day was a whirlwind of awe-inspiring speakers, empowerment and hot pink. I witnessed Anita Hill galvanize a majority female audience to be resilient, saw Dolores Huerta engage everyone in a chant for feminist power and heard Emily Ratajkowski delineate the unique role women occupy in contemporary politics. In between events, I mingled among CEOs, film producers, actors, writers and activists — all of them women. 
Unsurprisingly, my favorite part of the event were the art pieces and installations by female artists littered throughout the conference space. From photographic portraits to rotating neon signs, the works all celebrated the power and strength of femininity. 
As I examined oil paintings by The Kaplan Twins that ruminated on the complexities of celebrity culture through nude depictions of millennial celebrities, I couldn’t help but consider what it took for us to get to this point. Part of the answer, as you can probably guess, is art history. The groundwork for contemporary feminism and events like the Power Women Summit was laid decades ago by and through feminist artists. 
On many levels, a revolution was stirring in the late 1960s: Second-wave feminism gripped the country and women’s art finally rose to the prominence it deserved. In full force for the first time, women produced their own images of women rather than allowing male artists to objectify and misinterpret female forms as they had for centuries prior. Budding social movements borne from the publication of Simone De Beauvoir’s “The Second Sex” and Betty Friedan’s “The Feminine Mystique” were buttressed by coinciding artistic movements. In some cases — like with Yoko Ono’s performance “Cut Piece” during which she allowed strangers to cut her clothes off until she was naked to protest violence against women — art spoke louder than literature or academia. 
Art soon came to be regarded as a powerful medium for women to convey their experiences — to describe their lives, to flaunt ownership of their bodies, to shout their socio-political beliefs from the rooftops and have people actually listen, or at the very least be unable to ignore them. The symbiotic relationship between art and politics in their shared goal of inspiring change means that art has remained feminism’s most powerful tool, and perhaps most overlooked. 
In the art world, women created opportunities for themselves outside of male-dominated institutions by opening their own feminist art schools, curating independent publications and establishing their own galleries. Not only did these early feminists greatly strengthen and advance feminism as a political movement, they actually achieved a self-sufficiency and visibility within their field that women today are still struggling to reach. At the very least, the art industry is one of the few that boasts mainstream representation and recognition of its female standouts. 
In many ways, the arts did as much for feminism as feminism did for the arts. Before feminism, the art world was a notorious boys’ club and the cultural push for rights enabled women artists to create pipelines for themselves. Concurrently, art gave feminism a digestible and upfront medium through which to broadcast its message of empowerment. 
As I stared at an acrylic-on-canvas rendering of Amber Rose’s nipple piercings, I couldn’t help but feel oddly exhilarated by how far we have come. In a matter of decades, we have gone from one-dimensional female art models to Judy Chicago, The Guerilla Girls, Kara Walker, Jenny Saville, The Kaplan Twins — female artists who do everything on their own terms. I feel so lucky to live in a time when hundreds of women can congregate in a hotel ballroom to celebrate themselves and invigorate one another, and I see it as a testament to the inseparability of art from socio-political movements. And whenever I glance up at the Barbara Kruger postcard on my wall — a reimagined female masochistic silhouette that reads “You thrive on mistaken identity” — it’s also a reminder that our work is still only beginning but we have our fearless forebears to thank for that.

Following traditional meals and ceremonies, solo dancers perform as part of the Hindu Student Organization’s vibrant Diwali celebration. (Dimple Sarnaaik | Daily Trojan)
Last weekend, a statue of the Hindu god Ganesh, a deity meant to remove any worries or obstacles from the room, greeted visitors at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center ballroom. Bright yellow and orange colors representing fire covered the tables, and rose petals were delicately scattered throughout the room for the Hindu Student Organization’s Diwali celebration Sunday night.
HSO President Eesen Sivapalan kicked off the event by explaining the significance of the holiday.
“[Diwali] signifies the triumph of good over evil, of light over darkness and knowledge over ignorance,” Sivapalan said.
The Diwali celebration is HSO’s biggest annual event, so Sivapalan said he began planning during the summer. 
Sivapalan began the celebration by performing an invocation song for the crowd. Religious advisor Swami Atmavidyananda and Department of Public Safety officer Veeru Valencia then delivered opening remarks to the audience.
Afterward, attendees congregated to participate in the puja, a ritual in which they paid their respects to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth. Organizers then asked attendees to take their shoes off to honor the notion that “health is wealth.” 
Director of Hindu Student Life Bharathwaj Nandakumar, who led the puja, explained his own connection to what he considers the most important part of the Diwali. 
“If I’m doing this at home, I’m doing it just for myself,” he said. “If I’m doing it here, I’m connecting with all the students … it makes them feel closer to home.”
The evening featured a diverse lineup of performances, from solo dancers to the Trojan Bhangra dance team and the seven-person band Resonance.
After all seven musical acts concluded, the guests enjoyed dinner. The celebration’s food options ranged from pulav, rice with vegetables, to green chutney, spicy paste that acts as dipping sauce.
Isha Kamdar, a sophomore majoring in business administration who attended the celebration, explained why dinner was saved for last, as well as the importance of introducing others to the holiday. 
“People who aren’t Indian that come to this event should fully experience what we’re about,” she said. “We’re really focused on talking and spending quality time and enjoying each other’s presence … Eating comes after that.”
Sivapalan said he wished that the event could be held in a bigger venue to accommodate  more people. Even though nearly 550 students lined up for the celebration, about 150 of them could not enter because the ballroom had a capacity of 400.
However, what mattered most to Sivapalan was that the guests enjoyed themselves and that HSO had captured the spirit of the celebration. According to Sivapalan, the event has existed at USC since 2007, and he hopes it will continue in coming years.
“For us, it’s the flame that’s so, so tiny,” he said. “If that’s the reason why we’re having this event here, that makes it all the more important to us.”

Morrissey, former frontman of The Smiths, triumphantly closes Tropicália Music & Taco Festival on Saturday night with an eccentric performance. (Photo courtesy of Natalie Somekh)
Against the shimmering skyline of downtown Long Beach, former The Smiths frontman Morrissey closed Saturday night at Tropicália Music & Taco Festival with his signature showmanship — a fulfilling end to a riveting yet incomplete day one. 
After a slow start in the early afternoon, during which many patrons lounged about in the grass and along the waterfront of Queen Mary Park, singer and producer Toro Y Moi drew a sizeable crowd to the main Chalino stage as the festival entered its golden hour. His groovy, electronic pop sound perfectly captured the relaxed mood created by sunlight reflecting off attendees’ content faces as they swayed to the music. 
On the opposite side of the festival grounds, accessible by pedestrian bridge or underground tunnel, the Chavela and Juanga stages alternated acts throughout the afternoon. Surf punk band The Frights’ performance saw crowdsurfers rhythmically rising and disappearing into a tide of moshing bodies. Fronted by Mikey Carnavale’s charisma, the group created an energetic environment the entire time with head banging and improvised dance moves of their own. 
As chilling reverberations signaled the close of The Frights’ set, rapper Speak! launched into his half-hour number at the adjacent stage, spurring a massive audience migration across the lot. Paying homage to the festival’s Latinx roots, the rapper proudly announced his Mexican heritage and energized the crowd through call-and-answer chants in Spanish. However spirited his vocal delivery, it wasn’t enough to draw more than a meager crowd and Speak! failed to utilize the full space of the stage, causing an already-tight venue to feel even smaller. 
When indie folk singer Frankie Cosmos took the Chavela stage next, audiences once again scrambled to switch between sets — a commotion that could have been avoided by a larger site or more strategic stage placement. 
With a paralyzingly ethereal voice and an endearingly gracious personality, Frankie Cosmos effectively commanded an expanding audience as the festival became more crowded. In closing, she garnered cheers for mentioning the upcoming midterm elections Tuesday and imploring her fans, “Please vote, and bring a friend.” 
True to its name, Tropicália featured a generous selection of taco and other Latinx food trucks scattered across the park. Past 5 p.m., all food vendors converted to only vegetarian and vegan menus — amazingly, this switch hardly compromised the flavors or authenticity of the dishes. From tortas and loaded nachos to cheeseburgers and handheld funnel cakes, the food selection was varied and creative enough to satisfy any craving. 
Unfortunately, aside from food and live music, the festival provided very few other leisure activity options, save for a few merchandise stalls and games — including cornhole and a large-scale connect four board. This caused many patrons to lounge aimlessly in between sets or in between meals and the festival would have benefited from more merchant booths and art installations beyond papel picado banners strung across walls. 
Back on the Chalino stage,  American Colombian singer Kali Uchis had the formidable task of warming up an eager crowd for its headliner Morrissey — a duty she did not shy away from as she delivered an explosive performance. 
Donning glittery gold pants and a gem-encrusted gold corset, the “Isolation” songstress looked and sounded like a million bucks, marking the first time all day the mainstage had been used to its full potential. Midway through the set, she admitted to the crowd in a humanizing moment that she had ripped her pants and quibbed, “It happened to Spongebob, it can happen to anyone.” A departure from her previous performances, Kali Uchis demonstrated a newfound ability to engage an audience through conversation as much as through music. 
In the  most highly anticipated performance of the evening, rock singer Morrissey burst onto stage belting out The Smiths’ hit “William, It Was Really Nothing.” Dressed in all black and a T-shirt bearing his name over James Dean’s face, Morrissey paced the length of the stage several times as he sang and employed passionate gestures that spoke to his flamboyant flair. 
At once, the audience’s fervency was apparent; outstretched arms reached for him, people half-jokingly shouted for him to take his shirt off (a request he later obliged) and a few fans even leaped on stage to embrace him, only to be thrown off by security guards. 
Unfazed by the chaos, Morrissey cycled through his setlist and remained upbeat and dramatic as ever during his solo gems, chief among them “The Last of the Famous International Playboys” and “Everyday Is Like Sunday.” In between songs, he thanked the audience and professed his love for Mexico in Spanish, drawing roaring cheers. His voice dripping with sentimentality and his sharp-tongued lyrics ringing with eccentricity, Morrissey’s masterful and captivating performance proved why he has maintained an unwavering stardom since the 1980s. 
In the end, a spectacular headlining performance was hardly enough to save Tropicália from a day of subpar performances and lack of festival activities. Hopefully, future iterations of the festival will see more dynamic elements without compromising the excellence or diversity of its food and artists.

President Donald Trump announced last week that he intends to use an executive order to get rid of birthright citizenship in the United States. 
In other words, he wants to change the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, abolishing the law that all babies born in the United States are naturalized citizens. 
Virtually all legal experts conclude that such an executive order would be unconstitutional. 
But the president’s proposal opens the door to a necessary conversation: whether or not America should keep the policy of birthright citizenship. I don’t intend to answer that question here. Instead, I want to use the president’s comments to spark a conversation about why it is necessary to engage in premise-driven rather than ad hominem-based debates.  
I have listened to several conversations and debates between “experts” on cable news networks, peers in college and friends from home attempting to answer the question. 
In almost every case, defenders of birthright citizenship personally attacked their opponents and the president, most commonly characterizing them as racist. 
Simply put, this is an ineffective tactic, because reactionary attacks can actually validate and substantiate the other side’s argument. A personal attack against an idea’s proponent shows a lack of confidence in attacking the idea itself, as if the attacker does not have anything substantial to critique and must resort to pure insult.
In any debate, especially one regarding public policy, it is crucial to be able to clearly articulate reasons in support of a position. Arguing in favor of a policy simply because that policy has always existed is a weak argument — just like arguing against the character of the policy’s opponents. 
Trump’s proposal, then, has positive implications because it forces Americans to consider why they value birthright citizenship and strengthen their arguments in favor of it. 
I think we owe him some gratitude for opening the door to this much-needed conversation. It allows us to reflect on an American ideal not previously considered precisely because we have taken birthright citizenship for granted. Because Trump brought this conversation to light, the American public is tasked with the responsibility of examining why birthright citizenship is fundamental to American society. 
That said, just as it is crucial to be able to articulate an opinion and explain its underlying reasons, it is equally important to welcome debate against that position and open its premises to cross examination. Shielding a policy from debate and scrutiny puts its soundness into serious question and jeopardizes our ability to develop and solidify our opinions. 
In the birthright citizenship conversation, and in any policy-centered debate, it is important to keep an open mind and allow for ideological changes. 
Progress is made and consensus is reached through effective, open-minded debate. Therefore, a changing of the mind is not something to be ashamed of — on the contrary, it is something to be proud of.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
In 2014, the anti-affirmative action organization Students for Fair Admissions filed complaints against Harvard University for discriminating against Asian Americans on the basis of race. 
The federal lawsuit, which went to trial on Oct. 15, alleges that Harvard uses unfair admissions tactics, specifically targeting Asian Americans to create a more diverse student body. 
As Harvard attempts to diversify its student population with each matriculating class, it makes special efforts to recruit students from 20 states it classifies as “Sparse Country.” 
In these states, all students who have PSAT scores of 1310 or above are sent letters encouraging them to apply to Harvard. To recieve this letter, Asian American students must score 1380 or better. It was also revealed that admissions officers give Asian American candidates low “personal” ratings compared to their white peers, based on their perception of the applicants’ personality, even when alumni interviewers scored them similarly. 
Something has to be done to remedy these injustices. 
Harvard’s admission process is clearly flawed; however, an attempt to remove affirmative action completely will do more harm than good. Race should be considered among the wide range of factors in admission because it is an important part of prospective students’ identity and the campus experience, but schools must be careful not to over — or under — emphasize it.
It is clear that Harvard’s admission process is problematic. The disparities the university’s process produces unfair burdens among Asian American applicants and denigrates their accomplishments. But it also points to a wider issue — that of affirmative action and the way its well-intentioned goals can be manipulated by institutions. 
A study conducted by a Princeton sociologist in 2009 showed that white applicants are three times more likely than Asian American applicants who have the same qualifications to be admitted to selective institutions.
This train of thought categorizes Asian Americans into a stereotyped monolith and perpetuates the existence of the “Asian tax,” the extra 140 points Asian Americans have to get on the SAT to have the same chance of admission as white students. Large social and economic disparities exist within the Asian American demographic itself that disadvantages poorer and less educated groups.
Affirmative action aims to level the playing field for all marginalized groups who have faced disadvantages due to socioeconomic and political inequalities. There is no doubt that institutions need to comply with this standard to ensure fairness and promote a rich learning environment. 
However, the actual implementation of affirmative action is tricky. In this case, there is a paradox in the way race is perceived by Harvard’s admissions officers. The “positive” stereotyping of Asian Americans as smarter or more hard-working traps them in a losing battle. They have to play into the rigged game — reach a near unattainable level of excellence rooted in stereotypes or suffer in the admissions process because of it. According to the American Psychological Association, Asian American teenagers face higher rates of stress and suicidal thoughts due to academic pressures.
Grouping Asian Americans with white applicants, as the SFFA is doing, to negate the benefits of affirmative action is fallacious and wrong. White applicants have always been in historically advantageous positions, having not suffered from discrimination. 
The fact that Harvard fails in its current admissions process does not mean affirmative action is meritless. Harvard’s policy has failed Asian Americans because race was considered the most significant component of applications rather than one part of the bigger picture. 
Harvard’s admissions process ultimately uses a type of affirmative action that does not accomplish equality at all. It heightens institutional disadvantages Asian Americans face by holding them up to a standard not put in place for white applicants and other minorities. Instead of aiming to diversify the student body peacefully, it creates wedges between different communities of color by pitting them against each other in the college application process. 
Affirmative action, as ruled in Fisher v. University of Texas Austin in 2016, upholds the idea that race can be taken into consideration, but it cannot be a deciding factor in applications. Society has not yet reached (and may never reach) a point where race-blind admissions processes are implemented, as shown by the unequal standards to which Asian Americans students are held. Universities should keep affirmative action policies in place and use race as a factor in the admissions process. This allows them to correct institutional inequalities that disproportionately discriminate against Asian Americans and other minorities, regardless of the decision in the Harvard case.

USC students are among a growing number of new voters across the country registering to vote early or through an absentee ballot. (Sinead Chang | Daily Trojan)
As a college campus, USC is home to many voters who are casting their ballots for the first time. Many students have already sent their absentee or early ballots in the mail and many more will go head the polls Tuesday. 
“I think young people are really energized,” said Director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute for Politics Robert Shrum. “I think that to a large extent in our polling, in the USC Dornsife and L.A. Times poll, they disagree with [President] Donald Trump on the issues.”
An unprecedented surge in votes cast early or by mail has caused the total number of voters this year to exceed that of the 2014 midterm elections, according to CNN.
Krishan Patel, a freshman majoring in political science already sent his early ballot to his home city of Irvine, California. In California, residents get the option of voting at the polls on Election Day or sending in an early ballot as a convenient alternative. 
Patel believes that of the important issues at stake in the elections this year, climate change should be at the forefront of the conversation. 
“Due to corruption and a general denial of science, Republicans refuse to act on climate change by reducing CO2 emissions or implementing regulations,” Patel said. “Also due in part to the face that America is a gerontocracy, where older people are mostly in charge of Congress, I think it would help if Congress was a little younger … and if leadership was more environmentalist.”
Patel is excited to be a first time voter and believes the midterm elections are an important moment in political history. He said that if millennials and Generation Z do not vote, they fail to exercise their political power to the fullest extent. 
“The government does not represent us,” Patel said. “This election is a referendum on the soul of the country, just as every election will be from now on.”
Aidan Banfield, a freshman majoring in political science from San Francisco, is a first-time voter who believes that the most important issue this year is electing people in Washington who can compromise and work with one another. 
“I think it’s pretty ridiculous now how our government works, that you are tied down to … one entire set of beliefs just because of one party that you are a part of,” Banfield said. “I think that’s a big thing: finding people who are willing to work with anyone, not just the people who are motivated by working for their party.”
Banfield said that while he is excited to be a first time voter, the act itself is simple and just another part of one’s civic duty. He also expressed that the movement to register more young people to vote is perceived as a partisan movement. 
“I think Trump kind of woke up a lot of young people,” Banfield said. “[But], I think moving forward, no matter if you are leaning left, right, middle, wherever, everyone should be encouraged to vote … And I think right now, ‘go out and vote’ is code for ‘go out and vote Democrat’ … But I think it should be a thing where everyone should be voting.”
Annie Nguyen, a freshman majoring in theatre from Minnesota is not old enough to vote, but she urges all eligible youth to go to the polls. 
“People that choose not to vote [make] a very irresponsible decision,” Nguyen said. “If you have that privilege of deciding who is a leader in our country and decide not to use it, you are disregarding decades, if not centuries, of history and battle.” 
Nguyen also said she encourages all of her friends to become politically involved.
“[The elections] affect everyone my age,” said Nguyen, 17. “It affects everyone older and younger than me, whether or not you are voting. Your life will be affected by the decisions that people make.”
Aaron Sha, a freshman majoring in biological sciences from Oregon, said he will not be voting in the midterm elections due to the inconvenience of out-of-state ballots. 
“It is hard for me to acquire the means to vote,” Sha said. “I think that is a problem that plagues a lot of Americans. It is hard for people to access voting booths … A lot of people find it hard to vote and unfortunately I fell victim to that.”
Trojan Advocates for Political Progress President Alec Vandenberg said he hopes to communicate to students that that their votes matter. 
“Something I think that [I] believe in is that politics is local.” Vandenberg said. “While we understand that it seems like we don’t really get a voice in these national conversations …  there’s so much on the ballot whether it’s the California state proposition or … city council. There’s so many races where our voices are magnified.”
Vandenberg has also helped lead VoteSC, a bipartisan initiative to encourage students to register to votes through online registration platform TurboVote. VoteSC registered nearly  2,000 student voters this year compared to the 411 student voters who were registered in 2016.
“There’s the voter education part, the voter registration part and, finally, the get out to vote part — knocking down those barriers and then letting students know that not only can so many of us vote but all of us should believe we have that right and have that privilege,” Vandenberg said.
Shrum added that young voters who might be inclined to believe that their votes do not matter are misled on the issue. 
“Their vote does matter,” Shrum said. “Depending on which Congressional district they live in their vote can matter a lot in terms of who can control the Congress … I hate to say this, but when they say their vote doesn’t matter, they are wrong. I hope they don’t get into a situation where they regret that statement.”

Nearly 70 people gathered for the Sustainability Forum, an event for administrators, faculty, staff and students to discuss the improvements and importance of sustainability on campus Monday.
Olivia Pearson, co-director of Environmental Student Assembly and a senior majoring in environmental engineering, said the forum intended to give students, staff and faculty a chance to connect and share ideas about sustainability on campus. She said there’s a lot the University can do to improve sustainability on campus in ways that don’t require upper administration approval to get started.
“All of our departments can start to do something and start to make change and I hope that this inspired them,” Pearson said. “Also [I hope they] heard the student voices, how we want to get involved and how we want to offer our help and how we also want to be heard in these decisions.”
Ellen Dux, the programs director for the Office of Sustainability, offered updates on the University’s Sustainability 2020 Plan. The plan has goals in seven main areas, or verticals, with the three primary points focused on waste diversion, energy conservation and water conservation. 
Dux said the forum is an opportunity for groups on campus that do not typically communicate to have an honest dialogue. 
“I think we all realize that the more we are getting separate siloed groups together in one room to bring their voices together … then the more we can say be mindful that people on this campus, your customers, your staff [and] your faculty are demanding this of you,” Dux said.
Students who developed an app called Trojan Sense which allows their peers to give feedback on the temperature of rooms on campus also presented. 
Simon Blessenohl, the advisor for the team that created the app, said it has three long-term benefits: energy reduction, education and engagement. 
Leaders from the different sustainability student groups presented as well, including ESA co-directors Pearson and Claire Mauss, director of Sustainability Affairs for USG Catherine Atkinson and co-directors of the Environmental Core Tianna Shaw-Wakeman and Milena Castillo-Grynberg. 
The students gave updates about different sustainability projects they were working on. Atkinson, a junior majoring in political science, said USG Sustainability Affairs had instituted composting in Cardinal Garden Apartments last week and plans to do the same at USC Village next week. 
Mauss, a junior majoring in environmental science and health, discussed a project she is working on that would require incoming students to take a module on sustainability at USC.
“Students are coming from all over the world when they come to this university and sustainability looks different depending on where you’re from,” Mauss said. “We want to teach them about what sustainability looks like here.”
Pearson spoke about the Green Engagement Fund, which allows students to apply for funding for sustainable projects on campus. Trojan Sense is one of the projects that has received money from the fund, and Pearson said that students are making change in whatever small ways they can on campus. 
“We as students [have] been fighting for sustainable change on this campus for years,” Pearson said. “We want to show administration that we care, that we’re willing to work hard to make our campus green.”
Shaw-Wakeman, a junior majoring in psychology, echoed that sentiment. She said she believed when she was a freshman that change would happen if she could demonstrate to the University’s administration that students cared about sustainability through rallies and petitions.
“While that is true, sustainability should not be focused on whether or not the students want it,” Shaw-Wakeman said. “It is what students need. The student push behind sustainability should be supplemental to the top-down approach … that [the] administration is making sustainability a priority.”
