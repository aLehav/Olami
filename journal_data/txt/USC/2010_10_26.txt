On the night of April 9, 2007, thousands of fans crammed into the aging bleachers of the Fellowship House gymnasium for what was billed to be the greatest one-act play in the history of the Albert C. Donofrio Basketball Classic.
The tournament, which aims to showcase the brightest hardwood talents in the Philadelphia-South New Jersey area, became a one-night spectacle with lines out the door and boisterous crowds unseen in the history of the annual Conshohocken, Pa., event.
In what was to be his final exhibition before making a decision as to where he would play at the collegiate level, McDonalds’ All-American Tyreke Evans was scheduled to take the court in the tournament’s matchup of nationally recognized AAU teams, which pitted Team Final against the Playaz.
Just hours before tip-off and 100 miles away from the jam-packed arena, the St. Anthony Friars were informally training at an after school open gym session, when future Trojan and then-junior guard Jio Fontan received a call from his club coach presenting him with the rare opportunity to compete against the top-ranked guard in the country, Evans.
Without hesitation, Fontan — the MVP of the Playaz’ 2007 Spring Fling tournament title — made the two-hour trek down the I-95 Freeway, understanding that a one-on-one matchup with Evans was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to prove that he was more than just another member of legendary Hall of Fame coach Bob Hurley’s latest crop of talent.
Growing up as the chubby kid in his neighborhood, Fontan was groomed to play point guard with two pivotal skill sets: defense and ball handling.
So as he watched Evans torch him in the first half of their unanticipated showdown, what originally appeared to be the unique privilege of trying to shut down the future NBA first-round draft pick quickly transformed into a two-player, “anything you can do, I can do better” offensive routine.
In spite of his inability to contain Evans at the defensive end, Fontan redefined the flow of the game offensively and ultimately won over a startled crowd which largely forgot what it came to see in the first place.
The Evans-led Team Final would end up victorious at the conclusion of the fast-paced, affair, 109-102, but the buzz exiting the doors of the gymnasium had little to do with the final outcome or even the 29 points and 12 rebounds Evans poured in.
Fontan, despite the six inches and 40 pounds he lacked in comparison with his opposition, had managed to go toe-to-toe with Evans with a rather workman-like style of opposition to the tune of 29 points.
“It definitely was one of my biggest performances,” Fontan said. “At the end of the game I just got a lot of publicity for it, and a lot of attention from fans, a lot of feedback from the coaches on the opposite side. It made me feel like I could go out there and compete with anybody.”
Still, though that night was more or less the Fontan coming-out party, over the last three years the journeys of the two top-flight prospects have veered in vastly different directions.
One week after their night to remember, Evans announced he was taking his talents to the University of Memphis. In 2008, 11 games into his freshman year, Evans became John Calipari’s starting point guard en route to the Tigers’ second-straight perfect season. The Tigers would lose in the Sweet Sixteen, but not before Evans turned heads as a 2009 National Player of the Year candidate.
Two weeks later he announced he would forgo his final three years with dreams of the NBA on his mind. The Sacramento Kings granted his lifelong wish four picks into the NBA Draft, and he rewarded them in his rookie season last year averaging 20 points, five assists and five rebounds per game. His prolific first season in the association would be highlighted with the 2009-2010 Rookie of the Year Award.
Fontan followed up his newfound success by captaining the 2007-2008 Friars to a perfect 32-0 season, a New Jersey state championship and the overall No. 1 ranking in the USA Today Top 25 poll.
But unlike Evans, his high school exploits were not received in the same manner by universities across the country. The No. 7 ranked player in New Jersey was forced to settle on a scholarship offer from the lowly Fordham Rams of the Atlantic-10.
As the centerpiece in the program’s rebounding process, Fontan blossomed from the start, leading the abysmal 4-29 team in scoring (15.3 points per game) and in assists (132 on the season) in 2008.
Last season, after just six games of futility, Fontan — who was averaging more than 15 points and four assists per game — simply had enough. No longer was being a big fish in a small pond sufficient for the young man.
Although Fontan took a backseat as the ball-handler during his days at St. Anthony’s — as he played alongside Pittsburgh’s Travon Woodall and Kansas’ Tyshawn Taylor — getting thrust into the limelight as Fordham’s only legitimate playmaker simply wasn’t enough to satiate the competitor inside the Rams’ only silver lining.
So he decided to look elsewhere.
And much to the delight of Trojan fans, USC was at the top of the 20-year-old’s list last December when it came time to make a decision.
But where most impressionable, college-aged males would be impressed by the California girls, sandy beaches and nightlife scene that conveniently plays as a backdrop to USC’s campus, Fontan’s decision was inspired by a much deeper motivation — his family.
“Family is the biggest thing to me,” Fontan said. “I think that’s what makes me such a great player — because I play every game with the mentality that I am doing this for my family, my little brother and little sister. I want to give them the life that is as least stressful as possible, a better life than I had.”
And while his pursuit of a better life should be received with open arms, if you are expecting a savior by way of transfer, his addition on the court will sadly leave your ill-advised expectations unfulfilled.
He doesn’t come from a powerhouse program as senior forward Alex Stepheson did. He doesn’t possess the sheer speed of former point guard Mike Garrity, or the all-around polish of former point guard Gabe Pruitt. But there is one aspect he is far advanced in even before he takes the floor for the first time against the Kansas Jayhawks on Dec. 18 — disciplined strength.
It is the type of strength that is not defined by his unimposing frame, but in the fearless yet composed way in which he bodies up on the defensive end or drives to the basket regardless of who intends to impede his progress.
It is strength that can be found in the gregarious, unwavering smile with which he cheers on his teammates, despite the impending eight-game hiatus he will be forced to take at the beginning of USC’s season starting next month.
And it is this strength that keeps the dream alive — that the whirlwind, cross-country path along which Fontan’s promising career continues to travel will one day end with a fitting rematch against the budding superstar Evans.

The USC men’s golf team finished up action at the U.S. Collegiate Championship in Alpharetta, Ga., on Tuesday with a disappointing third round that left it in fourth place.

Despite a stellar first two rounds and a season-best performance by sophomore T.J. Vogel, the Trojans were unable to hold on to their second-place position. USC fired a 12-over-par 300 to put its total at a 3-over-par 867 (288,279,300), just one stroke behind third-place Texas A&M. Home team Georgia Tech won with a 28-under-par 836 (271,285,280).
Vogel led the Trojans on Tuesday, posting the best score of any golfer in round three with a 6–under-par 66. Hitting six birdies, two bogeys and an eagle, Vogel placed second overall in a field of 78, totaling 7-under-par 209 (74, 69, 66). Vogel steadily improved from a rough first round to take the top spot for the Trojans.
“I’m excited in the way I played [Tuesday] and how I finished,” Vogel said. “Second place is a good finish considering where I started in the tournament, so I’m excited about that.”
Second for the Trojans was junior Steve Lim, who grabbed sixth place with a 3-under-par 213. Lim shot a 3-over-par 75 in round three, with three birdies, three bogeys and a double bogey. In the first two rounds, Lim hit consecutive 3-under-par 69s and sat in second place.
Next for the Trojans was freshman Jeffrey Kang. Kang finished the tournament in a tie for 33rd place at 7-over-par-223 (69, 76, 78). Kang’s third round was his worst, where he hit a 6-over-par 78, with eight bogeys and two birdies. Kang was in second place in the individual scoring after round one but couldn’t manage to hold on to his spot.
Fourth for USC was freshman Ramsey Sahyoun, making his debut for the team. Sahyoun finished in a tie for 53rd place with an 11-over-par 227. Sahyoun hit a 9-over-par 81 in round three, following a 3-under-par 69 in round two and a 5-over-par 77 in round one. Sahyoun had three bogeys, two double bogeys, a triple bogey and just one birdie in a tough round that dropped him from 23rd place to 53rd.
Rounding out the Trojan squad was sophomore Sam Smith, who dropped from 33rd to tie for 62nd after round three. Smith finished with a 14-over-par 230 following a 10-over-par 82 in the final round of play. Smith’s best round was his second, where he hit an even-par 72. In his first round, Smith hit for a 4-over-par 76.
Despite a tough third round, the Trojans are looking more promising with each tournament. This was their third, and they have steadily improved with each showing.
The team remains optimistic about future events,
“In Ohio we started a little slow and finished in the middle of the pack, but in this tournament we came out strong and played well the first two days and we were right in second place,” Vogel said. “We’re young, and we had to play in the final group, which is a lot of pressure, and we’re only going to gain experience from this. Hopefully next tournament we’ll be able to take that experience and we’ll be able to come through better.”
USC gets its next shot at the Gilford Collegiate Championship, UCLA’s home tournament, on  Nov. 8-10.

Last week, Microsoft Corp. gave a gift to the USC School of Cinematic Arts to collaborate with the school and make advances in interactive media.
The Microsoft Next Generation Entertainment initiative will contain three key features for SCA’s Interactive Media Division: an endowed faculty member, the Microsoft Endowed Professorship, and support for the Game Innovation Lab and Interactive Entertainment program, said Tracy Fullerton, SCA associate professor and IMD chair.
“It’s a really great opportunity, the endowment,” Fullerton said. “And in addition to the endowed position, and support for the lab and for students, we’ll be working with people from Microsoft very closely.”
The initiative will also establish direct benefits for students, such as aid, access to internships with Microsoft, speakers, mentors and the opportunity for students to work with professionals in the classroom, Fullerton said.
Last March, The Princeton Review ranked USC’s IMD the No. 1 undergraduate game design program in both the United States and Canada.
USC’s program reached its position at the top of the list by setting its own standards, Fullerton said.
“We didn’t get there by comparing ourselves to other programs. … We have established our own [criteria] and we’re going to continue to set our own standards,” she said.
The School of Cinematic Arts has worked with Microsoft in the past on research projects and classroom collaboration.
“We ran a class with [Microsoft] last spring where we had Microsoft folks in the classroom working with students, and it was a great experience for everybody involved,” Fullerton said. “That was a big part of where they saw the potential.”
Microsoft was interested in working with USC because it is a leader in its field, said Phil Spencer, corporate vice president of Microsoft Games Studios.
“By working closely with an industry leading program, Microsoft hopes to play a central role in defining the current and next generation of interactive entertainment,” Spencer said in a press release.
Fullerton said the endowed professorship is a particularly exciting facet of the initiative. Microsoft will set up a fund to bring a professor to the school, ensuring that the program remains strong and has industry leaders serving as faculty members, she said.
“We will do a search and look for someone who is really innovative and fits with our curriculum and [who] will hopefully take us to new places,” Fullerton said.
Matt Payte, a senior majoring in cinema-television critical studies, said he was impressed to hear about Microsoft’s decision to choose USC for its initiative.
“I hear only the most amazing things about [the program] from friends,” he said. “They’re changing the industry while in college and they deserve a lot more recognition.”
USC’s IMD program is unique in that it is the only one of its kind located in a film school rather than in an engineering school, a feature that enables the program to thrive on creativity, Payte said.
“It’s the only one focused on creativity rather than on the technical,” he said. “The professors seem like the most creatively oriented people out there.”
The initiative’s endowed professorship will begin during the summer of 2011. SCA administrators, faculty and students will enjoy the additional financial support for the program as well as the strengthened position for USC to become an even more dominant leader in the field.
“We’ve all had a [significant] relationship with [Microsoft] over the years,” Fullerton said. “It’s clear that we have aligned with thinking about the future of the industry.”

Ten design concepts from USC’s Spectrum Design Studio were recognized in the national “Steal This Idea” competition.
The contest, which is put on by the Association of College Unions International, recognizes the best marketing and promotions work by colleges and universities. There are more than 40 categories in the competition, including brochure, postcard and T-shirt designs.
USC had 10 of its submitted designs chosen for the competition, including the USC “Fight On” spirit shirt — which won second place in the T-shirt category — and its Andrew Bird poster.
Creative juices · Natasha Wu, Lexi Markavage and Kristie Kam, all student workers for Spectrum Design Studio, work on designs. - Neha Jain | Daily Trojan 
Spectrum Design Studio Director Dane Martens said he hopes the studio will gain recognition on campus in wake of its success in the competition.
“The design studio isn’t something that people are fully aware of,” Martens said. “The things that we do may not be huge, but they are things that the USC community sees and interacts with on the daily basis.”
The schools do not compete for cash or prizes but rather for bragging rights; chosen designs are featured in the July issue of ACUI’s magazine, The Bulletin.
“[The studio’s success] shows that Student Affairs has yet again developed a program — an idea — that nets national attention and provides a really great service to all the departments here on campus,” Martens said.
USC’s main competition for this year included CalPoly Pomona, Boise State University and CSU Sacramento, which won the Best in Show prize, he said.
“It’s encouraging [designers] to get inspiration from others in the field,” Martens said.
The Spectrum Design Studio is affiliated with USC Spectrum, a department within Student Affairs. Spectrum is responsible for putting on live performing arts events for the USC community through committees such as the Program Board.
The design studio is in charge of creating posters and other promotional materials for Spectrum events, though it also works with groups such as the Office of Religious Life, Undergraduate Student Government and the School of Theatre to provide promotional materials.
Examples of the design studio’s work include the Ronald Tutor Campus Center’s flower logo as well as Conquest, Homecoming and Welcome Week graphics. Designs created for projects are saved, and the best are entered in contests such as the “Steal This Idea” competition.
Both students and staff create designs often, but designers turn to their peers in the office for feedback.
Although a portfolio is required to work at the studio, the designers that work on the projects do not necessarily have previous design experience, Martens said. The students cover a broad range of majors, including fine arts, business administration and communication.
“The students aren’t necessarily graphic design majors … which is something I think is interesting and exciting about the program,” Martens said. “If we think they have the raw talent, we cultivate that and teach them and train them to the point where they are winning national competitions and are coming out with great portfolios.”
Kristie Kam, a junior majoring in graphic design, said she came into the studio as an undecided major without much design experience. After gaining experience working at the studio, she declared a graphic design minor.
“Working there helped me for my design classes,” Kam said. “My job helped my major, and my major helped my job.”
Studio alumni have gone to work for companies such as DC Shoes, Disney and DirecTV, among others.
The studio plans to continue entering the competition in the future and hopes to one day win the Best in Show category, Kam said.
“Now that we’re getting more press about our design abilities, people will think of USC differently, [as a] school that can do design, even though we aren’t [known as] an art school,” Kam said.

One of the most common motifs in California’s 2010 gubernatorial race is that the state is at a critical juncture. Unemployment, healthcare costs, taxes, crime rates and pollution are rising. Pensions, water supply, government services and job opportunities are not.
It’s imperative that we keep these issues in mind as we select the next California governor. The leader best suited to the current state of affairs will be one who is pragmatic, experienced and knows the system well enough to triage California’s problems and act accordingly.
Once these qualities are identified, the choice of California’s next governor is clear.
Jerry Brown’s 40 years of experience, several of them in the governor’s chair, give him an edge that Meg Whitman’s time running eBay does not afford her. Brown also has the advantage of a favorable relationship with California’s labor unions and what he describes as a “long and well-deserved reputation for being cheap,” both of which the next governor will need to pull the state out of its escalating debt.
Experience is not everything, however, and it is dangerously nearsighted to assume that a candidate possesses all the necessary criteria to govern successfully just because he has served in office before.
But Brown’s seasoned outlook and experience in office does not preclude him from being progressive; his early support for AB 32, California’s groundbreaking legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, shows that he is quick to identify the most pressing issues emerging in today’s political climate, as does his clean energy jobs plan.
It bears repeating that running a state, especially one in California’s position, is not the same as running a business. Though Whitman touts her fresh perspective, radical thinking and sharp business sense, in the end, California needs wealth of knowledge more than it needs knowledge of wealth.
For that, the Daily Trojan endorses Jerry Brown as the most appropriate choice for governor.
You are all obviously too young to remember the first time Mr. Brown was governor of the formerly great state of California.  That record alone makes him unfit.
Editors:
You’ve written a article to endorse a candidate, but you have given no concrete evidence as to why he is a better choice for California.  You stated that “The leader best suited to the current state of affairs will be one who is pragmatic, experienced and knows the system well enough to triage California’s problems and act accordingly.”  But, what exactly is Brown’s “pragmatic” approach to fix California’s economy, immigration, education, and other social and civil problems?  How is Brown going to apply his 40 years of “experience” to solve these problems? 
Jerry Brown may have been in politics for 40 years, but it’s unclear whether those years of experience are even applicable for California today.  Can you explain what are those “experiences”? And how is he going to apply those “experiences” to solve the problems?  
BTW, USC may have gone up in the rankings and I have no doubts that ‘SC has many bright students and scholars.  However, the quality of most of the articles published on Daily Trojan do not reflect the intelligence of the current ‘SC student body.  Article such as this one and many others I’ve read on DT make me wonder whether USC should require all its undergraduate students to take at least one critical thinking course.
Liberal USC – thanks for your wise insights; keep up the good work and fight on!
What happened to USC that we’re now endorsing candidates that are antithetical to everything that has made this university great? How DARE YOU divide the Trojan Family by posting an official endorsement of a candidate! Let alone one who favors furthering the leftist policies that are slowly corroding and choking this great nation. 
Today, for the first time in my life, I am ashamed of my university.
Who cares about Governor, why won’t the DT take a stand on the issue that is really matter in this election?  If Prop 24 doesn’t pass, it won’t matter who the Governor is because the legislature still won’t be able to pass a budget.  If Prop 19 passes, the liberty of CA’s population will increase exponentially, eliminating a major part of the police-state that we are living in today.  If Prop 23 passes, we can say hello to a flood of Texas oil interests and say goodbye to the green jobs that are currently in development–and really, who can’t wait until Long Beach has its own version of Deepwater Horizon!
The Propositions are far more important than any gubernatorial or even senatorial race, and I hope that the DT concentrates on them in the upcoming days.
YES ON 19!
Oh, brother.  Kids will be kids.
Note to self: Upon relocating my business outside of California due to punitive high taxes, overregulation, and a spendthrift state government bureaucracy, never hire recent USC graduates.
Don’t let the door hit you on the way out.  Enjoy the graduates of ASU, I’ve heard that only 70% of their students have below a 2.0 now!
Amen brother! Obviously this young man was not old enough to remember Jerry’s first term. For a university that is trying to move up in the ranks as a premier learning institution these students don’t seem to learn. We obviously need more history classes (unbiased). As another writer stated, when did USC get so liberal?
When it changed from a commuter school catering to rich OC kids into a nationally-respected institution of higher learning that attracts some of the brightest minds in the world.
Are you saying the brightest minds in the world are only Liberal? Because if they are, I hope they do better than the brightest minds running are country today.
I never said that the brightest minds are only liberal.  I’m currently a student here and I have great friends, both liberal and conservative, and all of them are extremely intelligent.  What I’m saying is that as the university becomes more respected nation-wide, it begins attracting students of all types, rather than just attracting the types of people who would grow up to be major players in Watergate and unquestioningly support Ronald Reagan.
I’m really tired of hearing alums talk about how the campus is changing and how the liberal students aren’t representative of what SC “really is.”  Statements like “when did USC get so liberal” irk me because alums love to talk about how much better USC is academically now than when they attended in the 60s, 70s, 80s, etc., but never give credit to the fact that what is making this university so great now is the diversity of race, geography, nationality, and political orientation that now exists on campus.
What I’m trying to say is, don’t praise USC out of one side of your mouth for becoming such a great school and then disparage it with the other side because “the students today are so liberal, this isn’t the USC I loved!”  Understand that if one thing happens along with another thing (USC rising academically and USC welcoming a more diverse student body), there’s a correlation there.
I will remember this idiotic endorsement the next time I receive a contribution request from USC.
Good to know that your support of this institution is based on the decision of a board of editors that has no affiliation to the USC administration.  Classy.
“But Brown’s seasoned outlook and experience in office does not preclude him from being progressive; his early support for AB 32, California’s groundbreaking legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, shows that he is quick to identify the most pressing issues”
Oh yes, he’s got his pulse on EXACTLY the most pressing issues. Everywhere I go these days, I see starving Californians on street corners holding up crudely-made signs that say “MORE DEBT AND PORK FOR GREEN ENERGY SCAMS, PLEASE!” It’s not like there’s anything more important for us to spend our grandchildren’s money on.
“Jerry Brown’s 40 years of experience, several of them in the governor’s chair, give him an edge that Meg Whitman’s time running eBay does not afford her.” I seem to recall this argument being suspiciously absent when Barack Obama was running for President.  And speaking of AB32, do you have ANY idea what it will do to California’s #1 industry (Mfg)?  I’m sure the fiscally conservative trustees are very pleased that after all of their hard work to maintain the University’s endowment through the current financial crisis, their own newspaper stabs them in the back and supports Mr. CA Social Welfare himself.
UCLA called: it wants it’s student body back!
You “editors” have been indoctrinated throughout your school and college years with curriculum and teachers pushing a Leftist agenda; and you come through with a ringing endorsement of the left-leaning statist. Big surprise. 
Your best argument is we need a wealth of knowledge more than a knowledge of wealth? No, kids. We need someone who’s unafraid to take on the public sector unions so that this state can produce wealth again. 
I wonder who you’ll endorse for U.S. Senate.   *rolleyes*
Can you do me a favor and call me Edititor please? It’s just that I worked SO hard for that title…

One of the most common reactions to President Barack Obama’s visit to USC was that his inspirational speech was lost amid the overly partisan rhetoric that preceded it.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
The rally seemed to actually work against its self-titled theme of “Moving America Forward.” True progress in Washington will require a shift away from the increasingly partisan and extremist nature of American politics.
Whether that partisanship is Nancy Pelosi steering a bill through Congress with virtually no consultation with the other side or Republicans deliberately obstructing Democratic initiatives to help their own electoral chances, party politics have become the chief obstacle to the lean, efficient government that both parties claim to support.
These days, it seems that someone could count the moderates in Congress on their fingers and toes; it is telling that at the outset of the healthcare debate, conventional wisdom suggested that there were at best three Republicans who Obama would have a chance to win over.
Thus, the pleas to vote Democrat that peppered Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa’s opening address on Friday — and virtually every speech after that — were not exactly productive in terms of moving the country forward.
Unfortunately, the counterproductive nature of partisanship is unlikely to discourage the Democrats from engaging in it if they think it will help them win elections. But maybe another idea will: emphasizing that voters need to elect Democrats is probably a bad strategy in 2010.
In the current political environment, promoting your association with the Democratic party is not a good way to win over swing voters. In the latest Politico and George Washington University poll that used a generic ballot, independents preferred the GOP to the Democrats by a sizeable 14-point margin. In addition, a large majority of Americans voiced concern over the direction of the country, which subsequently leads to negative feelings about the party that currently controls both the White House and Congress.
Many of the Democrats’ signature initiatives — healthcare reform, financial regulatory reform and liberal social policies, such as the impending repeal of “don’t ask, don’t tell” — are unpopular.
So is their leadership: 51 percent of those polled reported an unfavorable impression of Obama, and 56 percent said the same about Pelosi. Overall, 42 percent had a favorable impression of the Democratic Party compared to 50 percent unfavorable; in contrast, the numbers for the Republicans were 50 percent favorable and 41 percent unfavorable.
The idea that marketing an association using the Democratic Party brand is a poor strategy is also demonstrated by the voracity with which Republicans are promoting their opponent’s party affiliation this election cycle.
This could result in sending Tea Party candidates, including several whose shockingly extreme views and comments have been pointed out repeatedly in this column, to Washington next year.
By definition, it can only be a good idea for one side to feature party affiliation in its campaign strategy, but this year both are doing so.
Instead, Democrats should change their focus to the particulars. They should concentrate on their individual races and strive to change the perception of this election from a referendum on the party in general to a choice between two contrasting individuals.
In California, for instance, Jerry Brown and Sen. Barbara Boxer seem to be perceived as more likeable personalities than their Republican  opponents Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina.
Democratic Nevada Sen. Harry Reid is highly experienced, and his seniority has resulted in major benefits for his state; his opponent, Republican Sharron Angle, therefore has far less pull and has resorted to advertising that she helped a pregnant teenage rape victim “turn a lemon situation into lemonade” by counseling her to avoid an abortion.
Delaware Democratic Senate nominee Chris Coons is a fairly nondescript candidate with a background in law; his opponent, Christine O’Donnell, is a controversial figure with a background in witchcraft who claimed the Constitution does not mandate the separation of church and state.
The list goes on. Democrats should stop advertising what party they belong to and start talking more about themselves and their opponents.
It is ironic that doing so will probably give the Democrats their best chance at retaining their majorities, and also help “move America forward” by tempering the partisan atmosphere that prevails today.
The party that likes to call itself “progressive” should start acting like it. It would be for its own good and for the good of the country.

Good luck with that, Democrats. We’ll see you the next time you win congressional majorities… in a generation.
Well, thanks “hsr0601” for that practically incoherent comment. 
Again, Daniel’s Leftist blinders cause him to stumble and completely miss the point. 
Party politics is not what’s keeping us from a lean, efficient government, Daniel.
Leftist policies strongly militate against a lean, efficient government by definition; it is utterly absurd to pretend otherwise.
Your Leftist blinders also cause you to frame the debate in terms where you label your opponents as “shockingly extreme” for nothing more than pointing out that “separation of church and state” is not in the Constitution (in other words, the truth) or believing in limited government, strong borders, sane environmental policy and lower taxes.
Which, my friend, the vast majority of Americans do believe in.
See ya November 2.
It’s well known that democracy & technology shape the future of a nation.
Let’s give Democrats a chance to make headway.
　
The former President Bill Clinton said  “It took me four years to balance the budget, then I gave you four surpluses, paid $600 billion down on the national debt,” 
And I’d say :  It took 8 years for the Bush mishandling to get a final verdict.
Let’s not fall for the outrageous claim : Heal the 8 year-long chronic disease quickly, but do not see a doctor, adding to the deficit.
　
I do believe strongly that the nope or tea party, the insane group, are set to wreck a havoc on America.

College can be tough for many reasons: midterms, annoying roommates and, most importantly, the absence of Mom’s cooking.
But that doesn’t mean college students have to gain the Freshman 15 every semester by eating at Burger King nor spend their whole month’s allowance in just one week at Lemonade.
Packaged foods and meals have inevitably become a practical staple in any college student’s kitchen. Just take a peek into the average dorm pantry or refrigerator and you’ll likely find a private stash of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, Top Ramen and Rice-A-Roni.
Although packaged and canned foods are not always the healthiest, many brands, such as Campbell’s Healthy Request Soups, are making an effort to create more natural and nutritious products with less sodium and more high quality ingredients.
The only problem with packaged and canned food is that they can get repetitive to the point of nausea. Having Top Ramen every night for dinner might save money, but in the end you might never want eat it again — let alone see it.
An easy solution to making the same old conventional packaged or canned foods into something unusually appetizing is to add a few simple ingredients.
For breakfast, instead of just plain instant oatmeal, add some brown sugar or cinnamon to sweeten it up. For a healthier version, throw in some fresh or frozen blueberries or raspberries.
If plain butter on toast isn’t enough, mix it up by adding a couple shakes of cinnamon and sugar on top. Chop up an aromatic leaf of fresh basil and tomato to liven up an ordinary bagel with cream cheese.
Pancakes mixes, such as Bisquick, are also great for quick but tasty breakfasts. For some extra flavor throw in a handful of chocolate chips.
“[Bisquick] literally lasted me a whole year,” said Rachel Porter, a junior studying piano performance. “It’s also really nice because on the back it includes all different sorts of recipes like pancakes and waffles.”
Of course, it can be difficult to make the trek to the grocery store for students without cars, but if they can hitch a ride, it’s well worth it.
“This semester it’s a little harder to go back [to my apartment] and make food since I live off campus,” Porter said as she grabbed four packages of Pasta Roni at Ralphs. “Sometimes [Pasta Roni] tells you to add chicken to it, which I do. One time my friend put clams in it. It was a full-on gourmet meal.”
Other favorite pasta foods, such as Kraft Macaroni & Cheese or Top Ramen, can be converted into flavorful meals as well. The bland macaroni and cheese can be transformed into exotic Mediterranean macaroni and cheese with the help of some feta cheese, tomato and basil. Annie’s Macaroni and Cheese is another healthier option, made with organic pasta shells and real aged cheese, all for a total of $2.06 at Ralphs.
For a spaghetti dinner with a special tang, toss in a handful of olives or marinated artichoke hearts to a pan of tomato sauce.
To turn Top Ramen into a top-notch entrée, try adding a raw egg. It makes the broth thicker as it cooks in the noodles. Canned tuna can be made into a scrumptious spread with a few shakes of dill or a tablespoon of a favorite salad dressing mixed with mayonnaise, salt and pepper.
On a cold or rainy night, canned soups can not only warm up the stomach but also give a tantalizing thrill to the taste buds with some extra seasoning. Campbell’s Tomato Soup is reborn anew with a few sprigs of basil and a handful of crunchy croutons. Chicken noodle soup turns into a Mexican tortilla soup with bits of shredded cilantro, crumbled tortilla chips and grated cheddar cheese.
Of course, not to leave out the more nutritious foods, a mixed salad greens package makes a restaurant-worthy salad with just a few extra ingredients like marinated artichokes, avocado, bacon bits or sunflower seeds.
Some delectable deserts include crumbled Oreos or chocolate chip cookies from Chips Ahoy over ice cream, hot chocolate with a couple pinches of cinnamon or a waffle ice cream sandwich with maple syrup poured on top.
Leftovers can also be combined or transformed into new meals. Simply put leftover Rice-A-Roni Spanish Rice on top of a pile of crispy tortilla chips with some beans and cheese and turn it into a knock-out nacho fest. Or take spoonfuls of tuna left over from a sandwich and add it to a salad mix with some diced veggies.
Just because college students have limited time or talent to make a homemade meal from scratch doesn’t mean that they should force-feed themselves generic pre-made packaged meals time after time again.
A quick and simple addition of a favorite herb, spice or vegetable can act as an inspiration to both the food and the cook.

Braving potholes, uninformed drivers and all-around inhospitable city streets, Los Angeles cyclists are forced to fend for themselves. And that is exactly what they’ve done.
In the last few years, Los Angeles’ urban cycling community has put its DIY ethics in action, propelling the scene forward by creating specialized group rides, opening bike shops and spearheading advocacy organizations that attempt to do the impossible — turn the sprawled-out dystopia of Los Angeles into a bike-friendly city.
Unlike bikeable urban areas such as Portland, Ore., San Francisco and New York that have long had physical and social two-wheeled infrastructures, Los Angeles is still growing into its cycling identity, and this year it celebrates a milestone that might seem petty to those cities.
It was only five years ago that L.A.’s first bike co-op — the Bicycle Kitchen, or La Bici Cocina — moved out of its space inside the Los Angeles Eco-Village and opened its non-profit doors at the now-bike-centric intersection of Melrose Avenue and Heliotrope Drive.
Though it might not sound like that long ago, Bicycle Kitchen has inspired and shaped the growth of Los Angeles’ biking community in the last five years more than a bike shop ever could.
This is mainly because the Bicycle Kitchen is not a bike shop at all — it’s a volunteer-run operation that promotes bicycles as viable transportation and runs programs to educate cyclists of all ages on how to build and maintain their ride.
From beginning cyclists who want to learn how to change a flat tire to more advanced riders who just need to rent a repair stand and some tools so they can swap out their new cranks, the Bicycle Kitchen is a bike-obsessed cultural center that welcomes all.
In addition to teaching local high school students how to build their own wheels and offering up a ladies-only repair night, the co-op also sponsors rides to local art galleries, bike-related street fairs and fundraising concerts, all of which spur dialogue between the city’s diverse riders.
Since its move to East Hollywood in 2005, the Bike Kitchen has become a model establishment, inspiring cyclists in other Los Angeles neighborhoods to form their own take-what-you-need, give-what-you-can bike joints and making the United States’ most car-obsessed city into one that is also rich in bicycle co-ops.
First there were Bike Oven and Bikerowave. Bike Oven started in a Highland Park garage as a place where friends could come to trade parts and fix bikes. Word spread quickly and in 2007, it moved into a more accessible location on Figueroa Street and is now Northeast Los Angeles’ signature co-op.
Bikerowave spent several years hiding in an industrial area of Santa Monica before expanding into a legitimate storefront in Mar Vista last year, making it the Westside’s go-to for DIY bike repairs.
It is interesting to note that the current locations of all three of these co-ops — Bike Kitchen, Bikerowave and Bike Oven — are either next door to or across the street from the area’s major bike shops.
It’s hard to imagine that a nonprofit set on empowering riders to build their own bikes and do their own maintenance would do well in the vicinity of a for-profit bike shop that has available-by-the-hour mechanics on hand to do the same, but in Los Angeles, the two operations work in collaboration as an unlikely yin and yang.
Although Bikerowave and Bike Kitchen give riders the tools to set them free from relying on bike shop mechanics for minor repairs, their for-profit counterparts (L.A. Brakeless and Orange 20, respectively) are still able to sell new parts, conduct bike overhauls and offer accessories that can’t be obtained from the co-op’s donated junk bins.
Breaking from this yin-yang trend, though, are two new co-ops that have found homes in the last year. Like many similar community projects, Los Angeles’ co-ops grew out of bikers seeing a need and creating the solution themselves, without regard for business-friendly locations or business etiquette.
The Bicycle H.U.B. in Long Beach conducted workshops and repair stand rentals out of a garage, a dive bar and other transitory spaces for several years before obtaining permission to move into a condemned car body shop across the street from the Pacific Coast Highway Blue Line station.
From its epicenter at the corner of Heliotrope and Melrose to its latest fringe locations on Main St. in Santa Ana, the bicycle co-op movement has permeated L.A. more than anyone thought possible.
By offering dynamic education options and affordable bicycle repairs to everyone who comes in, Los Angeles’ co-ops are attracting people from all skill levels, age groups and social classes, bringing diversity to the expanding bicycle community and preparing Angelenos for a car-alternative future.

I ride my bike from 2wheelbikes.com all over town. It’s kind of hard to do in Los Angeles with all the cars on the road though. I think it’s great that more kids are getting in the bicycle culture. I love it.

Most Shakira fans that come across the cover of her 1996 album Pies Descalzos would have trouble recognizing the singer. More than a decade later, the starlet has broken into mainstream success with a heavy dose of blonde hair dye and overt sex appeal.
Sunny day · Despite goals, the album’s optimism feels phoney. - Photo courtesy of Sony US Latin 
Gone are the multicolored braids and controversial, quirky lyrics. Now, anyone can hear Shakira on local radio stations and in the World Cup soccer jingle.
Her latest release, Sale El Sol, does not lend itself to fans of her off-beat personality but instead to those who jumped on the band wagon during Shakira’s sudden transformation. Her latest tracks take listeners on a journey that is murky at best.
Looking past her drastic change from earthy to sexy, the album does not fare well on its own. The tracks succeed more at showcasing a recording studio’s ability to strain her voice to the highest pitch possible instead of displaying Shakira’s talent, and the results land somewhere in between a robotic screech and a computerized wail.
“Loca,” featuring Dizzee Rascal (the Spanish version features El Cata), launches listeners head-first into this strange, distorted voice. It does not sound like Shakira — more like the product of digital effects turned up to their max. The repetition of this tone makes the track difficult to listen to. The heavy mixing does not succeed in creating a sexy, smoldering voice, but rather a smothering, grating noise that reverberates painfully in the listener’s brain.
The trumpets in the track lend themselves to blaring speakers, and the bouncing piano help put listeners in a dancing mood, but the obvious effort Shakira exerts toward making her voice sexually attractive puts a damper over the otherwise infectious rhythm. As she chants I’m crazy but you like it in the chorus, the listener can bust out a few dance moves before getting a heavy dose of shrill tones that suffocate any dance floor.
Perhaps some assistance from another famous friend will help listeners forgive Shakira’s overt use of technological distortion. And who better to turn up the heat than the unapologetic and rambunctiously  sexual Residente from the Latin duo Calle 13?
The clever and risqué rapper teams up with Shakira to create a sex-laced track with characteristically shocking lines. In “Gordita,” Residente seems to take hold of the reins, adding pithy lines, such as Yo soy como Bambi, tu venadito which translates to “I am like Bambi, your little deer.”
Paired with other similarly sensual phrases, the track mostly revels in sexual tension and eventual conquest. The rendezvous, however, takes a strange turn as the lyrics mention vamos a tirarnos los dos del mismo puente / sin paracaídas … como hippies cuando están fumando, which translates to “lets throw ourselves off the same bridge without a parachute, like the hippies when they are smoking.” The strange turn only takes away from the song’s initial potential.
It’s an interesting idea, but the song fails to deliver and only launches Shakira into even more screeching high tones paired with overtly physical entreaties.
Aside from the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, “Waka Waka (This time for Africa),” no other track stands out or captivates listeners. The songs mostly follow the same formula, making the album feel like a little girl trying to fit into her mother’s  high heels rather than an artist fully aware of her musical persona and distinct style.
Despite the overtly sexual nature of most of the tracks, Shakira attempts to introduce some emotion in a few. The album begins with the title track “Sale El Sol,” a clichéd song that presents the tired idea of the sun always coming up the next day.
The potential for a bit of sincere emotion dissolves with its formulaic set-up. The optimism comes across, but the crafting seems plastic, with choruses put in where they would be expected.
“Islands,” a fully English cover of The xx’s song, manages to sound slightly more captivating, but Shakira’s vocals again disappoint, almost as if the notes in the song lay just out of reach.
Although Shakira makes a conscious effort to feed off the current interests of music audiences, the end result sounds like a hyperactive copy of the tracks that already exist today.
Even worse, this attempt is obvious, making the album lose more appeal and, most importantly, authenticity.
Some songs could invade airwaves — and some already have — but the album fails largely because Shakira attempts to satisfy the wants of a very fickle audience member. Perhaps she can look back at years past and take a leaf out of her very own book to see that mainstream success does not mean one must don a widespread and expected persona.
There’s room for a genuine and unique personality as well.
Horrible review..
Absolutely horrible , why bother to do a review when you obviously do NOT like SHAKIRA…
Shakira is one of the most talented and honest artists of our time..
I doubt that this woman Eva knows anything about music or even about Shakira …
The album seems to be a pretty decent upgrade from her last one. It might help to include that she sings much better in Spanish, her lyrics are much better in Spanish and she even sounds more Latin in her new album than in the previous one. I’m pretty sure her Latin fans appreciate this, given the fact that her most recent albums have way too many songs in English, which do not show her true potential. And, please, robotic? She is still one of those singers who performs well live and on a CD. Give her the credit she deserves. More than 10 successful years in showbiz definitely deserve recognition. She performed one of her songs in the parking lot of the Honda Center in Anaheim after the concert and thanked her fans for their support, something to acknowledge as well.
“the starlet has broken into mainstream success with a heavy dose of blonde hair dye and overt sex appeal.Gone are the multicolored braids”
Shakira’s braids have been gone for more than 10 years , she has the same blond look for  the last  5 albums,  its stupid to keep critizing it as if she just do it yesterday.
The bias on this review is  very obvious. No matter the quality of the songs the reviewer still would  fit the review as a characterization of the blond sellout that she (the reviewer) has stuck in her mind for the last 10 years.
In reality  this album is the closest to her early work that Shakira has produced since she became a global star.
Most other serious reviews confirm it.
This is a terrible review. When you go into reviewing an album with such a strong bias, you really lay on the criticism for every minute thing. I would say you even invent things to criticize, which is an amusing approach to reviewing an album. Her voice hardly sounds “robotic” or “computerized”. I’m not sure what album you were listening to. 
I’ll stick to Entertainment Weekly, which gave Shakira’s album an “A” rating and All Music Guide, which gave the album 4.5/5 Stars.

Amid the activity of restaurants and shops in Little Tokyo sits the neighborhood’s newest addition, Hold Up Art gallery.
Mix and match · Unlike many galleries with narrow focuses, the Hold Up Art gallery mixes “high” and “low” forms, from street pieces to abstract paintings, photos and sculptures. - Photos by James Violette | Daily Trojan 
Opened in February by USC alumnus Brian Lee, who graduated in 2009, Hold Up Art has seen a steady rise in popularity in recent months. With the help from his good friend and fellow USC alumnus, Ben Kaufman who graduated in 2008, Lee drafted a business plan and took off running.
“I wanted to create a gallery that basically brought art together in one space, saying that all art is art whether or not it’s cheap art or really expensive art,” Lee said.
Lee, who curates the gallery with Kaufman said his background was an important building block toward opening the gallery.
“I was born and raised in L.A. and I was always doing art. I was always drawing and painting,” he said.
After committing to an art history major, Lee spent time exploring other departments, including communication and psychology, but eventually returned to art history.
“My art history background is really what drives my passion and that’s only possible because I took art history at USC,” he said.
Before opening Hold Up Art, Lee spent time working for well-known urban artist Justin Bua.
“My senior year I had to only take two more classes, so I took this drawing class, and the teacher was Justin Bua,” Lee said. “I basically got hired as his personal assistant for a year after college.”
Opening an art gallery wasn’t Lee’s goal from the start. After his time with Bua ended, he began thinking about his next move. Using the experience gained from his work as a personal assistant and his education at USC, Lee realized there was a niche that wasn’t being catered to.
“There are definitely enough people my age, or young people, that want to start getting into art that don’t have a comfortable place to go to,” he said. “That was the inspiration for the gallery.”
Lee decided to approach his gallery in a non-traditional way. To connect with his audience, Lee began using Facebook — something not commonly used by galleries —to involve interested people and make it easier for them to stay current with the gallery. Lee also thought he could set himself apart by opening his gallery in a part of town more commonly known for its eating establishments.
“Ultimately, the thing that makes us work as a gallery is that we are a gallery in a non-gallery area,” he said.
In addition to its standard display of art, the gallery holds exhibitions throughout the year. The latest, “Marxist Glue,” opens Thursday at Hold Up Art. The exhibit will showcase the work of street artists in the form of wheat-pasting.
“Wheat-pasting art is art that is already in the city,” Lee said. “It is up on walls, it’s up everywhere, and most people see it every day and don’t even think about it as art. But all the people that do it treat themselves as artists.”
Work from artists such as Mear One, Shark Toof and Robbie Conal will also be featured at the gallery. The artists will create their pieces on the walls of Hold Up Art this week leading up to the opening and the walls will later be either sold or given away.
Lee has big plans for Hold Up Art and said he would eventually like to supplement his gallery with a restaurant or a bar and, if the opportunity presents itself, to open Hold Up outposts in other cities.
By relying on hard work and progressive ideas, Hold Up Art is turning heads and changing the idea of what an art gallery is supposed to be. It is little wonder then why Hold Up attracts the next age of art appreciators.
“A gallery is the hardest thing to run next to a restaurant and we were able to take this old model of what a gallery is and re-evaluate it and change it so it becomes an easier process,” Lee said.

Academia is a survival of the fittest game in which the weak are weeded out by their own deficiencies and the strong succeed by whatever means they can.
We spend an inordinate amount of time staring at incomprehensible textbooks and lecture notes that might prove illegible, all in the name of earning good grades.
Of course, cheating is another  one of those means. More and more it seems that getting grades often isn’t about how to answer questions, rather about how to find the answers.
Over the years, students have discovered new ways of finding the answers they want, from clear-cut cheating — using cell phones during tests — to more hazy forms of academic dishonesty, such as pulling information on Sparknotes and Wikipedia.
Recently, social networking took studying to a whole new level of creativity when recent college graduate-turned-entrepreneur Ryan Stevens launched the website NoteUtopia, a networking site that allows students to buy and sell their old lecture notes, study guides and homework.
The website now faces scrutiny, as the California State University system sent the site a cease-and-desist letter, insisting that the sale of class notes violates the state education code and raises concerns about increasing the number of students that skip classes.
This issue further opened the debate over intellectual property rights on class material created by students.
It is yet to be determined whether or not NoteUtopia will become a groundbreaking Internet phenomenon with noticeable impact on the higher education system, but still highlights an important in the world of higher education.
No matter how many precautions administrators take to prevent cheating, students will always find a way to use technology to bend the rules — it seems that educators have no choice but to accept evolving technology as the reality about how students learn today.
Rather than fight the technology that can enable less-than-ethical study methods, educators should instead structure classes to stress the new skills students need to find answers in this new media age.
Sites such as Sparknotes, Wikipedia and NoteUtopia reflect the rapidly increasing rates at which information is shared — and these trends should be integrated into the classroom, not ignored.
Buying and selling notes and other class materials might seem a dubious practice, but it’s not so different from asking a fellow classmate for the notes in a missed lecture.
The issues of profit and potential widespread ramifications are legitimate causes for concern, but the practice where students seek information to aid them in class for a price is essentially the same as hiring a private tutor or taking extra classes.
University administrators wary of this technology underestimate the work students go through to find creative ways to study, whether that means getting other people’s notes or reviewing example questions from past homework or tests.
Problem solving in the real world requires teamwork and asking around for help to find an answer as efficiently as possible.
Websites like NoteUtopia are just resources that students choose to use; if they help a particular student, all the more power to that student.
In this economy, an academic degree no longer guarantees a job. Employers are not looking for workers who can take tests in multiple-choice, short-answer or essay format.
Ultimately, many employers are not solely impressed with the grades, but rather the skills learned in order to get those grades. Having the ability to find answers creatively by accessing the resources at one’s disposal demonstrates valuable job skills.
Cheating, in theory, means that those who take too many shortcuts in their studies do not gain the necessary knowledge or skills expected of a college graduate.
Of course, in the real world, cheaters often do get the upper hand in society. As unfortunate a reality as that might be, we cannot hinder the sake of progress by restricting technologies that could help many students.
Cheating will not go away, and we can only hope that educators encourage students to learn and try on their own merit rather than take shortcuts.
Ideally, professors want their students to be able to arrive at the solutions to the problems they propose on their own with the material they teach.
But that kind of exclusive relationship neglects to account for how students get a significant amount of their learning outside the classroom.
Sites such as NoteUtopia should not be penalized for their potential ability to act as a substitution for academic work but should rather be utilized for their ability to aid academic achievement.
Educators and students should use available technologies to stress the problem-solving skill sets necessary for the growing demands of this competitive world.

Students who were sent to the hospital after a Central Washington University party weren’t poisoned by a date-rape drug but by the alcoholic energy drink Four Loko, police said.
Nine students were sent to the hospital after experiencing symptoms of being drugged, and police initially suspected that the students were victims of Rophynol, the date-rape drug.
Tests found only traces of marijuana in the victims’ blood, and police traced the incident to consumption of the malt liquor drink called Four Loko.
The alcoholic energy drink has an alcohol content of 12 percent — a can of beer typically has an alcohol content of 4 percent.
The discovery led the president of the university, James L. Gaudino, to ban all alcoholic energy drinks on campus.
“The health and safety of our students has to come first,” Gaudino said in a statement. “We need to make sure that we’re sending a strong message to students about the dangers of AEDs, and we need to know more about the way it affects health and behavior.”

YouTube is home to all sorts of entertainment, ranging from the charming to the obscene. Despite its playful nature, YouTube has developed into a vehicle that has a serious impact on the future of the entertainment industry, one that is especially convenient for the modern music lover.
For fans, it provides a destination for all of their favorite music videos as well as concert footage and much more. For artists, it’s a promotional tool that can reach an enormous amount of people and can, in some cases, spur a music career. Major artists today use YouTube as a legitimate means of spreading the word and accelerating their popularity.
And as Lady Gaga said recently on her Twitter, “If we stick together we can do anything.”
Apparently that holds true.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, Lady Gaga has become the first artist to reach one billion views on YouTube.
“We reached 1 Billion views on youtube little monsters!” she Tweeted yesterday to almost 7 million followers. “If we stick together we can do anything. I dub u kings and queens of youtube! Unite!”
Sadly for Gaga, the record might not hold. Remember that Canadian boy wonder? Teen pop star Justin Bieber — who currently trails Gaga with around 962 million YouTube views — is expected to take the record in about a week.
Still, Gaga will always hold one record close to her heart: Back in July, she garnered 10 million Facebook friends, more than President Barack Obama.

Carly Fiorina, Republican candidate for the California Senate race, was admitted to a hospital this morning after showing symptoms of an infection related to reconstructive surgery she had this summer.
Fiorina, a breast-cancer survivor, received antibiotics to treat the infection, Deborah Bowker, Fiorina’s chief of staff, told the Los Angeles Times.
Bowker said Fiorina’s hospitalization would only affect her schedule today, and said Fiorina “is upbeat and her doctors expect her to make a quick and full recovery and be back out on the campaign trail soon.”
The campaign of Sen. Barbara Boxer, the democratic California senate candidate, released a statement on Tuesday hoping for the best of Fiorina’s recovery.
“We wish Carly Fiorina a speedy recovery and hope she is able to returne to her normal schedule soon,” said Rose Kapolczynski, Boxer’s campaign manager.
Fiorina’s experiences as a breast cancer patient and survivor have led her to speak out against President Barack Obama’s healthcare legislation, according to the L.A. Times. Fiorina said she believes that the healthcare bill would be too expensive for the 32 million Americans it will affect and would not adequately address a number of issues with current system.

The Trojans might not be playing in any bowl games this year (or next), but with all the hype surrounding Saturday’s game against Oregon, you wouldn’t know the difference.
The No. 1 Ducks are coming to town, and many people have taken note.
After a grassroots social media-driven movement began last week urging fans to “Red Out” the Coliseum, ESPN’s College Gameday announced that it would feature the game this week.
All eyes are on the Trojans, who have had two weeks to prepare for an Oregon team that has more than a legitimate shot at its first BCS title. Oregon, ranked No. 1. in the AP poll and No. 2 in the BCS poll, leads the nation in offensive yards per game (569.1) and points per game (55.1). Oregon also leads the nation in turnover margin.
For the Trojans, who returned to the AP rankings this week at No. 24, Saturday’s game is the most hyped of the season — and it’s easy to see why. With alumni in town for Homecoming Weekend, growing support from fans online and national media attention, this game might be played in October instead of January, but the stakes couldn’t be higher for USC.
There’s also some added incentive: Not only did USC lose its Homecoming game against Stanford last season, the Ducks also beat the Trojans last year, 47-20.

Experts say personal issues have damaged the Meg Whitman campaign, allowing Democratic gubernatorial candidate Jerry Brown to secure a 13-point lead, according to the latest Los Angeles Times/USC poll.
Former governor and current Attorney General Jerry Brown leads Whitman, former eBay CEO and Republican candidate, 52 percent to 39 percent.
“She’s got a problem that’s not issue-related — it’s a personal one,” said Darry Sragow, interim director of the poll, during a press call about the numbers.
The latest LAT/USC poll is part of a six-survey series on the upcoming midterm elections on Nov. 2. For this poll, 1,501 voters were polled from Oct. 13 to Oct. 20.
Democrats had favorable numbers for both major elections in the poll.
Democratic California Sen. Barbara Boxer holds onto an eight-point lead against Republican senatorial candidate Carly Fiorina.
Though the poll has Boxer leading Fiorina 50 percent to 42 percent, this is not necessarily indicative of what the results will be for such a close race, said Tom Hollihan, professor of communication at the USC Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism.
“A poll today is accurate, but it’s accurate today. It’s not necessarily going to predict the outcome on Election Day,” Hollihan said.
Students said, however, that they aren’t sure how much impact it will make on the minds of young voters.
“I think it will target young people to get more information about what’s going on,” said Zac Levine, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “But I don’t think students will necessarily be influenced by the polls.”
Hollihan agreed.
“Political events like the big rally on Friday are much more likely to be inspirational to engaged university students as a result of this poll, even if it has USC’s name on it,” he said.
Other events can also sway public opinion, such as the allegation by Whitman’s former housekeeper that Whitman knew she was of illegal status while under employment.
“If you look at the tea leaves here, it does seem that the incident involving the housekeeper seemed to have a very big effect,” said Manuel Pastor, a USC professor of American studies and ethnicity.
October’s 66-question poll surveyed only registered California voters and was created by two polling firms, the Democratic firm Greenberg Quinian Rosner and Republican firm American Viewpoint.
“Over the course of the campaign, different events occur and it’s good to be able to track what the impact of those events is on public opinion. Each of these polls is just a snapshot of public opinion at the time,” said Ann Crigler, a USC professor of political science and interim director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
The LAT/USC poll is unique in its survey of voter enthusiasm and oversampling of Latino voters that Crigler said is an important sector of the California electorate.
She also said students working on the poll help spread interest around campus.
“A lot of students aren’t from California, so they haven’t really kept up with what’s going on, but now they’re more interested and they’re sharing that with their friends,” Crigler said. “They’re like ‘Wow, that’s our school.’”
At Ebay experience counts. So also in politics!! In Ebay they would ask employment candidates for their experience in their profession before being hired – but Whitman is throwing a lot of personal cash in the hope of becoming California’s top officer with no experience of holding elective office.  In the previous debate- in addition to the illegal immigrant housekeeper’s 9 yrs of employment with Whitman, Brokaw asked another question to make Whitman uncomfortable – – if Whitman was so eager to improve California politics by winning this election, why didn’t she ever cast her own vote in previous California elections. Whitman looked stunned, and apologised- but I think it’s too little & too late.

The National Institutes of Health awarded the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center a three-year $1.6-million grant for clinical trials of a new drug to treat prostate cancer.
After skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer among American men. The drug, AEZS-108, may offer hope to patients with few remaining options and could be a more effective and less toxic treatment for all sufferers of advanced prostate cancer.
“I’m very enthusiastic,” said Dr. Jacek Pinski, associate professor of medicine who led the research team. “This particular drug offers a more direct treatment while reducing toxicity and decreasing side effects.”
Pinski and his team, which includes multiple oncologists, researchers and instructors from USC, received the grant after submitting a comprehensive amount of preclinical data to the National Institutes of Health.
“Its not easy to get these kinds of big grants from the NIH,” Pinski said. “We had to ensure there was sufficient preclinical data in our proposal to demonstrate that the project is meaningful and the drug is effective.”
AEZS-108 allows for a more focused treatment as a result of the LH-RH peptide that is capable of recognizing a protein on the cancer cells and directing itself to them, reducing the detrimental effects on other healthy cells.  
Pinski’s former instructor and mentor, endocrinologist Dr. Andrew Schally received the Nobel Peace Prize after discovering the peptide LH-RH in 1977. The combination of the peptide with doxorubicin was first evaluated in clinical trials for women with different types of cancer in Europe. Those studies determined the drug’s relatively low toxicity, but this will be the first time it is assessed for the treatment of prostate cancer.
The clinical trial, which will take place at the Norris Center’s Clinical Scientific Office, will include 55 participants, all of whom have metastasized and castration-resistant prostate cancer. The other qualification is that the patients must have failed treatment attempts with a traditional chemotherapeutic agent. Therefore, the drug is something of a last resort for many of the participants, Pinski said.
“The traditional prostate cancer patient, or any patient with a localized disease, generally has success with surgical or radiotherapy treatments,” Pinski said. “But in cases of reoccurrence and metastization there are significantly fewer treatment options. We hope to change that.”
The research team will conduct an abbreviated Phase I trial to gauge any toxicity differences in men. After that they will move on to Phase II, where they administer the drug and collect data via tumor measurements, CT and bone scans.
The Norris Center is collaborating with Dr. Yu-Chong Tai of the California Institute of Technology, whose newly developed porous artificial-membrane device will collect circulating tumor cells for analysis. The new device is meant to be quicker and more efficient, expediting the analysis process.
“After we collect the data we’re going to measure the reception of the tumor cells and correlate it to our clinical outcome measures,” Pinski said.
The trial is set to begin in the next few weeks according to the research team, which is waiting for the drug to be delivered. If the trial proves effective and noninvasive during the three-year study, Pinski said it will make great strides in the advanced prostate cancer treatment.

Trojan® brand condoms released its annual study this month, ranking USC 51st in its 2010 Trojan Sexual Health Report Card, dropping from 37th place in last year’s report. The report ranks the availability of sexual health resources at universities across the country.
Bert Sperling, president of Sperling’s Best Places, the public relations firm that works with Trojan to produce the report each year, said the rankings were indicative of year-to-year changes and not necessarily trends in sexual health.
“Everyone is making progress overall, but they can change position because another competitor is either doing better at the moment or lagging behind,” Sperling said. “Some schools might make some improvements in their websites or change certain policies, such as increasing their hours to their student health center. When that happens, other schools will get bumped down the list.”
The study evaluated 141 schools in 12 categories, including the availability of contraception and STD testing, health center hours of operation and the existence of resources such as student peer groups and lecture or outreach programs.
USC has numerous services for students’ sexual health, said Paula Swinford, director of Health Promotion and Prevention Services at USC.
HPPS, located in the University Park Health Center, has a resource center, where students can get free condoms and rapid anonymous HIV-antibody testing. Students can also talk to peer health educators, fellow students who undergo training to administer STD tests and answer questions regarding sexual health.
“It’s good that this report continues the conversation about safe sex among students,” Swinford said. “Sexual health is an important aspect of any young person’s overall well-being, and the USC community works extremely hard to provide various options for its students.”
Swinford also noted that one reason why USC might have dropped this year is because the university also focuses strongly on other aspects of student health, such as preventing alcohol or substance abuse, promoting an active lifestyle and reducing stress.
These factors, all of which were not included in the data analyzed by the report card, make up many areas of the “I am a Healthy Trojan” campaign, aimed to increase the well-being of students on campus.
Swinford said, however, that she would still like to see the health center make new options available for students in the future, such as Ask Alice, an online forum where students can ask questions anonymously. This program was started at Columbia University and is a major contributing factor to its No. 1 ranking.
Javid Pour-Ghasemi, a peer health educator at USC, agreed that this idea could help raise awareness on campus.
“I’ve noticed a lot of people are shy to come in here and ask questions. Something like Ask Alice could increase our exposure and make people feel more comfortable asking questions that they wouldn’t otherwise ask,” said Pour-Ghasemi, a senior majoring in economics and biological sciences.
Many students on campus said they still remain unaware of some of the available resources, but they also say that safe sex is a priority for them.
“The university could definitely stress sexual health a lot more. They seem to focus on alcohol and drug safety, but not how to be sexually safe,” said Andrea Farfan, a freshman majoring in psychology. “Still, from what I have heard, safe sex is not that much of an issue at USC. People here seem to be pretty smart about that kind of stuff.”
Columbia University, Michigan State University and Ohio State University earned the top three spots in the rankings, with DePaul University, Brigham Young University, and the University of Idaho ranking as the bottom three schools for sexual health resources.
I keep my genitals clean
What makes a college or university sexually “healthy”?
Is it the amount of condoms that they purchase?
Sexual health “resources”….name them specifically, please.
Seems like some people just want to appeal to & bring out our animal nature
& are not concerned at all with our human nature.
i am confused by this article…. this mean that students should start purchasing sexual products to up the ranking of univ in health sector…. go trojans… fight on…. lol

For some local students, suiting up in a uniform and spending hours each week running drills brings opportunities to engage in the community and learn self-discipline.
Attention · Youth members of the Department of Public Safety Law Enforcement Cadets meet every week to learn from officers about service. - Shabnam Ferdowsi | Daily Trojan 
“I joined the program to give something back to the community. This is a great program that opens doors to inner-city kids,” said Ryan Welch, a 16-year-old cadet who is part of the Department of Public Safety Law Enforcement Cadets program.
After seeing potential in a struggling program working to benefit local youth, DPS Assistant Chief John Thomas decided he wanted to improve the organization.
“I grew up in the neighborhood around USC and saw lots of potential in the program,” said Assistant Chief John Thomas. “The goal is primarily the development of young people and the creation of good solid citizens by instilling a sense of service and integrity.”
With that mission, Thomas changed the program’s direction “from floundering to flourishing.”
The program, where local youths shadow DPS officers and perform various community service acts, has nearly quadrupled in size in three years and has tripled its funding in the past year.
The number of cadets has increased from eight to more than 30. In addition, the program recently received $22,000 from a University Neighborhood Outreach Grant. Last year, the program had approximately an $8,000 budget, said Capt. David Carlisle.
Cadets between the ages of 12 and 21 years old dedicate 14 Saturdays to train at the LAPD academy before performing community service at USC. Cadets shadow DPS officers on patrol, pass out crime prevention tips in the surrounding area and even help secure the Coliseum during football games.
With the help of fundraising, donations and grants, there is no cost to be a member of the Law Enforcement Cadets.
Lizeth Avila, a 19-year-old cadet, said the program “instills discipline, courage, commitment and integrity to do right.”
“You get involved with successful people that I know can help you,” she said.
For example, one cadet interrupted an assault with a deadly weapon, possibly saving the victim’s life, Carlisle said. Some of the organization’s activities give cadets with disadvantaged backgrounds experiences they could not have otherwise.
“Camp Superstars sent the cadets to the Lake Arrowhead area; several of them had never been to the mountains,” Carlisle said.
The organization took first place in a drill competition and was dubbed Post of the Year — an award that goes to youth organizations — in the greater Los Angeles area.
Although Thomas views marching and physical conditioning as important aspects of the program, he said he plans to heavily emphasize education.
“Marching and drill can only take you so far; education prepares [the cadets] for life. The cadets are not equipped; they don’t know what it takes to be successful students,” Thomas said.
Thomas will make study hall mandatory and expose cadets to more than just law enforcement. Thomas said he believes cadets benefit from lectures about SAT preparation, study skill development and saving money for college.
Considering that many of the cadets often come from disadvantaged families, finding the money for college is a challenge.
“My dream is if a cadet is accepted to USC, [he or she] will get a full scholarship,” Thomas said.
Thomas said he hopes to capitalize on the organization’s affiliation with USC and send more cadets to colleges in the future.
A former cadet started college at Arizona State this year and another is currently studying at San Diego Christian College, Carlisle said.
Roy White, DPS public safety officer and the DPS Associate Adviser of the Year, has volunteered nearly every day for the past eight years to work with the organization.
“This program is truly needed with the diminishing of school activities,” White said. “You get to see how the juveniles [negatively] interact with police … It should be a positive relationship.”

After several months in office, Undergraduate Student Government leaders say they’ve improved communications but still have projects they’d like to finish.
Some of these projects include the items that were on President Chris Cheng and Vice President Nehi Ogbevoen’s platform, such as changes at the Lyon Center.
Senior Director of Communications Liz Trower said that the biggest accomplishment is the increase of communication between USG and various groups on campus.
“Chris and Nehi have been working tirelessly to forge strong bonds with admin, faculty and stuff in order to maximize USG’s improvement of student life,” Trower said. “In my three years in USG, I can truly say that their zeal and passion to connect students and administrators is unparalleled.”
Cheng and Ogbevoen emphasized that these relationships were not as strong in the past.
“One of our biggest causes was to rebuild a lot of the bridges that had dissolved or weakened over time between various departments on campus,” Cheng said. “We created bonds with organizations that previous administrations haven’t.”
By doing this, administrators will be better informed about student concerns as well as have the opportunity to support USG projects.
“We’ve truly maximized our opportunities to build relationships across campus,” Ogbevoen said.
Chief of Staff Maya Babla also agreed that everything has been going smoothly.
“Everyone is doing their job and everything is going really well,” Babla said. “We’re working on maximizing efficiency and making sure that every single concern has a tangible outcome.”
Another initiative that has been implemented is the increased Wi-Fi across campus. USG has been working with Information Technology Services to update the campus’ wireless, and ITS has set up a website where students can check the process of the increasing wireless capability on campus.
Expanding the Greater LA program was also part of Cheng and Ogbevoen’s platform. The original two trips have been increased to seven, with transportation to popular sites around Los Angeles such as the Universal CityWalk, the Grove and various beaches.
Cheng said that international students have been especially receptive to this program and that he hopes that other students will take advantage of it as well.
Despite the various projects that have been accomplished, Trower said that plans for others have changed.
“We’ve tried a number of different projects in different areas and we’ve advocated for a lot of student interests and projects,” Trower said. “A large portion has been successful and some haven’t been successful, but those aren’t necessarily failures. We’ve either changed paths or decided that a project probably won’t come to anything and moved on to other projects.”
In the final months of the semester, Cheng and Ogbevoen said they look forward to seeing the completion of continuing projects as well as the success of various events.
Babla noted that there has been more committee interest this year than in recent years. With many of the members involved in more than one committee and contributing above and beyond their job descriptions.
Some projects and events that will be completed in the next couple of months include another bike forum, an event involving TOMS Shoes and local artists, and a health week, where students will have an opportunity to see what the university has to offer in terms of health resources.
