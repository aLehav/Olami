USC continued its winning streak this weekend, defeating Arizona State 15-11 marking the Trojans’ sixth straight win. 
USC has now won all five of its Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference matches this season. This also served as the final game of the Trojans’ four-game road stretch, as they come back home next weekend to take on rivals UCLA.
After regaining the No. 1 spot in the national rankings Monday when it beat Stanford, USC pulsed with confidence heading into this week’s game. It knew it would be a tough test having to match up against the No. 9 ranked Sun Devils and freshman attacker Vanda Baksa. Baksa leads the MPSF in goals scored with 72 on the season, 11 more goals than the next closest player.
The Trojans wasted no time at all grabbing a quick 3-0 lead, thanks in part to assist on two of those goals by senior driver Grace Tehaney. Tehaney had a massive impact on the win for USC, finishing with 5 assists and a goal. 
The Trojans led the entire first half, ahead only 11-8. It was the most first-half goals USC allowed all season, and junior goalie Carolyne Stern gave up 8 goals with only 1 save. 
Head Coach Marko Pintaric knew the team needed to change defensively.
“We made a decision to have Erin in the goal in the second half to give a different look, which proved to be a good decision,” said Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “That’s why you’re training goalies and creating competition among them … we’re very happy to have [two goalies] to play as a team.”
To start the second-half, redshirt junior goalie Erin Tharp took over the cage. Tharp, who played her first game in nearly a month last weekend against San José State, played well for the Trojans. She only allowed 3 goals in her half of play and picked up 2 saves along the way. The change of personnel helped propel USC to victory as they closed out the Sun Devils.
“We didn’t play our best defense in the first half, giving up shooting opportunities to Arizona’s dangerous shooters,” Pintaric said. “In the second half, really tightening playing more of a press and really not allowing Arizona’s shooters to have free looks like in the first half was a huge difference.” 
With only one game remaining in the regular season, the Trojans feel confident in their hopes to repeat as national champions. The Trojans have outscored their opponents 82-44 and have trailed for a total of 55 seconds during their win streak.
The Trojans’ final game will be a rematch against crosstown rivals UCLA, who beat USC on a last-second goal earlier this season. A win would clinch the regular-season MPSF title and get the number one seed going into the conference tournament. 
A win would also wrap up a bid for the Trojans in the NCAA tournament which will start May 6.
“You’re already entering the postseason, and this is where you’re trying to get in your rhythm, and this last game is USC UCLA. It’s always exciting,” Pintaric said. “Those are the games that we are getting ready for, you’re getting goosebumps even talking about. The team is taking it very serious and I know they will be ready.”
USC will have their senior day next Saturday as they host the Bruins at Uytengsu at 1 p.m.

What Liverpool and Manchester City matches lack in the traditional intensity and mutual hatred of other rivalries, they make up for in pure competitive spirit. Over the past five years, Liverpool vs. Manchester City has become the defining Premier League rivalry of the late 2010s and early 2020s simply because they are possibly the two greatest teams to ever grace the League, and their reigns of dominance have just so happened to coincide.
For the last four seasons, either City or Liverpool has won the title, and this season will almost certainly continue the streak, as third place Chelsea languishes 13 points behind Liverpool with only eight matches left to play this season. 
In those seasons, City and Liverpool have routinely accumulated the highest point totals in Premier League history. In fact, the four highest single-season point totals all belong to either City or Liverpool. City is the only team to ever earn 100 points in a season — the famous “centurions” squad of 2017-18 — but Liverpool posted 99 points in its own title-winning season of 2019-20. 
In a testament to the tight competition between these two clubs, the 2018-19 season gave us the third and fourth-highest points tallies simultaneously, when Manchester City barely clipped ahead of Liverpool’s 97 points to capture the title with 98. 
In short, it’s a genuine miracle we have the ability to watch two behemoths of Premier League history battle each other for five consecutive seasons, given that Manchester City sat only one point ahead of Liverpool entering their match on Sunday. Unsurprisingly, the two clubs have dominated the Premier League again this year. 
Liverpool scored the most goals this season (79) and City scored the second most (72). Manchester City conceded the fewest goals (20) and Liverpool conceded the second fewest (22). 
Additionally, their underlying numbers suggests that, while Liverpool has perhaps been slightly lucky defensively, they are legitimately the best two teams in the league; no team creates higher quality chances than City or Liverpool and no team concedes fewer quality shots to their opponents than City or Liverpool. 
The key to their dominance in both cases is considerable investment and near-perfect squad building. Since the arrivals of manager Jürgen Klopp at Liverpool and Pep Guardiola at City, both clubs have spent considerable money acquiring players, but have always done so with a plan for integrating signings and maximizing their abilities. 
For instance, Liverpool spent a world record fee for a defender when it signed Virgil van Dijk from Southampton for £75 million and immediately made him the centerpiece of its back line, an athletic defender who could impose themselves on almost any forward in the world. 
More recently, Liverpool acquired Luis Díaz as a long-term replacement for Sadio Mané at left-wing. That could cost up to £50 million, a steep price for a player from the Portuguese top division, but Díaz has immediately contributed to Liverpool, giving them flexibility and depth up front. 
City has yet to see the best from midfielder Jack Grealish — the big summer signing of 2021 — but goalkeeper Ederson, center back Rúben Dias and midfielder/winger Bernardo Silva have all been home run signings of the Guardiola era. 
While Klopp and Guardiola have their stylistic differences, both teams typically look to suffocate their opponents with possession and pressing, so it almost always results in fireworks when Liverpool and City face each other with their seasons on the line. 
In typical fashion, the two sides delivered absolute fireworks once again. While some matches with a trophy on the line result in a cagey affair where both teams fear making mistakes and restrict themselves with conservative play as a result, Klopp and Guardiola never pulled their punches. 
In the early days of the rivalry, Klopp allowed City to dominate the ball, but now that Liverpool has the defenders and midfielders whose on-ball ability matches City’s, the German coach has decided that the best way to play against City is to fight fire with fire. 
Liverpool presses harder than City and pushes its back line up high, dangerously so at times. But he trusts the athleticism and positioning of Van Dijk and Joel Matip to go one-on-one with Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and Phil Foden. 
While Liverpool will be slightly disappointed to leave the Etihad with a 2-2 draw, its bravado paid off. City took the lead on two occasions, and both times, Liverpool upped its tempo and equalized quickly, first through Diogo Jota, then Sadio Mané. Ultimately, Liverpool lacked the shots to put themselves 3-2 up.
Manchester City controlled possession with its casual aplomb, as Bernardo Silva roamed up and down the pitch, dictating tempo and ensuring the ball reached the feet of Foden and Kevin de Bruyne, who scored City’s first from outside the box with the help of a heavy deflection off Matip’s calf. 
Jesus also had a memorable, industrious performance from left wing, netting the goal that put City ahead 2-1 and pressing Robertson relentlessly such that the Scottish full back, who normally runs the left touchline from box to box, didn’t have the liberty of pushing forward with his usual ease. 
All in all, City and Liverpool played another classic, full of the technical and tactical excellence we’ve come to expect from Klopp and Guardiola’s squads. This rivalry is purely about soccer, and as such, these teams have immense respect for each other. 
The postmatch interview on USA Network gave us a beautiful moment from Guardiola. “First,” he said, “Jürgen’s the best,” to which NBC’s Robbie Mustoe replied, “Well, he says you’re the best.” 
Somehow, it’s true, they’re both the best — maybe the two best teams to ever compete in the Premier League.

Three weeks have passed since USC began its first spring practice of the Lincoln Riley era. We’ve seen imminent changes and tweaks to a program that was surely in need of some. 
As we enter the second half of spring practice, Riley said this is the time where average teams begin to fall off and great teams start to separate themselves from the pack. It’s too soon to evaluate that, but for now, here are five takeaways midway through spring practice. 
Energy and rapid improvement
When USC Head Coach Lincoln Riley shocked the college football world by coming to Los Angeles, it was clear that changing the program wouldn’t happen overnight. It hasn’t so far, but the energy around the program shifted immediately. 
Multiple position coaches, like offensive line coach Josh Henson and defensive backs coach Donte Williams, mentioned the positive reactions from players surrounding the changes to the program and improvement. 
Williams said players had “a ton of energy.” As early as last Saturday, that improvement continues to happen at “all levels” Riley said. Defensive Coordinator Alex Grinch also mentioned there’s been some good work overall on his side.
The energy in practices was evident from the first day of spring work, compared to last season where players showed sudden bursts of energy, then massive drop offs.
The rapid progression of players’ adapting to the new system is a great sign of the team’s response to the changes implemented. When a new staff comes in, it may take time for players to buy into the new culture. Instead, Riley’s team has demonstrated a “good natural progress,” midway into spring practices, Riley said. 
Caleb Williams’ progression in Riley’s offense
Out of all the USC transfers, sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams is the flashiest one. In one season at Oklahoma, Williams threw for nearly 2,000 yards with 21 touchdowns and 4 interceptions. He also ran for 442 yards and 6 touchdowns. 
Oddly enough, Williams said he’s practicing “not moving around so much,” and sitting in the pocket more than last season. It’s a different strategy from a player who electrified last season with his legs. 
Williams’ decision to stay in the pocket may foreshadow how defenses will possibly play him. Since he can break into space easily and turn small gains into big ones, learning to be effective in the pocket is crucial. Pac-12 defenses will also surely hope to contain him inside the pocket.
Even though Williams is working on staying patient, it doesn’t mean he won’t turn up the field. During last Tuesday’s practice, redshirt junior tight end Jude Wolfe said that Williams had a 40-yard run during a team period.
At Thursday’s practice, Riley said Williams practicing his pocket work is “a part of progression of a young quarterback.” Whether or not that will show up on the field in the fall is still up for debate. 
The “Gold Plated” decal
One of the more intriguing changes to this program so far has been the integration of “Gold Plated,” a decal process for helmets. 
Players start with a blank Cardinal helmet and have to earn the Trojan logo in a variety of ways — demonstrating habits off and on the field, having a competitive nature, upholding accountability and showing reliability. 
Teammates nominate each other, and then have to receive final approval from the staff. Sophomore inside linebacker Raesjon Davis was the most recent recipient of the decal. USC football great Matt Leinart was on hand last Tuesday to award Davis with the honor. 
It’s a competitive and cultural aspect of this team that seemed absent in previous years. Riley seems to use the decal process as a way to motivate players to not only be excellent on the field but everywhere outside of the field. Accountability was always a problem during former Head Coach Clay Helton’s tenure, which makes the transition into this next takeaway seamless. 
No shortage of accountability in the program
One of the hot topics going into Riley’s era was how he’d address accountability. That always seemed to hurt Helton, prompting lots of change on Riley’s part.
It seems like he’s taken that as seriously as anyone. Last Saturday, he mentioned reporters would be on Zoom the entire weekend if he talked about some of the changes he’s made in terms of accountability. 
Everyone and everything is held to the same standards under Riley. Whether it’s working with a tutor academically or going to a position meeting, everything is treated the same. It’s either a championship standard or bust. 
That championship level is critical in a program that has only one Pac-12 championship in the previous 10 seasons. If USC hopes to get back there, it has to start with accountability and holding everyone to the same standards. Riley hasn’t shied away from ensuring that. 
Alabama transfer Shane Lee’s emergence as a leader
When graduate student inside linebacker Shane Lee made the transfer from Alabama to USC, it was no secret he would be huge for the linebacker group. A player with experience in the toughest conference and on one of the best college football teams in the country would surely help establish a culture. 
So far, he’s done that and become one of the Trojans’ top leaders. 
Riley said Lee has been “instrumental within our program,” with a very similar impact to what former Alabama quarterback Jalen Hurts had when he came to Oklahoma three years ago. He also added that Lee bought into his role as a leader from day one and is critically important to the culture change at USC with his aggressive leadership.
 Inside linebackers coach Brian Odom said Lee “adds a lot to the room” through his experience and the way he carries himself. Odom also mentioned Thursday that Lee, along with senior linebacker Ralen Goforth, has separated himself from the linebacker group. 
Lee has simply made a huge impact on not only the defensive side of the team, but for the Trojans in general. Being from a winning program at Alabama, Lee brings a rare quality to the table for someone in the transfer portal. 
His experience will prove crucial for holding the middle of the field down.

Significant group disparities in naturalization — the process where individuals born outside of the United States become U.S. citizens — based on applicants’ race, ethnicity, gender and religion were found in an empirical study published March 12. The study was co-authored by Emily Ryo, a professor of law and sociology at the Gould School of Law, and Reed Humphrey, a USC alumnus and Ph.D. candidate at the University of Washington.
In their investigation of naturalization applications decided by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services between October 2014 and March 2018, researchers found that non-white and Hispanic applicants are less likely to be approved than non-Hispanic applicants. The study also found that male applicants are less likely to be approved than female applicants, and applicants from Muslim-majority countries are less likely to be approved than applicants from other countries.
Further, research data demonstrates that different factors, including race, gender and religion, combine to produce a certain group hierarchy in terms of approval probabilities.
The study found the probability of approval for Black men is 89.27%, compared to that of white women at 94.15%. The probability of approval for Black individuals from Muslim-majority countries is around 86.43%, compared to 95.56% for white individuals from non-Muslim majority countries.
Ryo’s inquiry into records of naturalization application denials revealed that a considerable portion of administrative data for the category is missing.
“What really surprised me was just how scarce, or maybe I should say, nonexistent, administrative data was in this area,” Ryo said. “For example, we just couldn’t even find any individual-level data that was available that would allow us to look at agency decisions to approve or deny naturalization applications.”
Ryo filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for data on naturalization applicants with the USCIS in August 2018. However, officials were slow to cooperate with Ryo’s request, she said, which prompted her to file a federal complaint against USCIS with the assistance of American Oversight, a nonprofit organization working on government transparency issues, in July 2020. The litigation lasted more than a year.
“What requesters under that act are allowed to do after they’ve exhausted administrative appeal is to actually file a lawsuit, and that’s their remedy for inadequate production of records,” Ryo said. “I was just following what’s laid out under FOIA as my right, in terms of trying to obtain the records that I had requested initially from USCIS.”
Ryo concluded that, despite laws requiring USCIS to provide explanations to denied applications, 20% of denials in the data were absent. Another 14% in the data set were attributed to unexplained reasons, such as “Other” or “Secondary Evidence.” 
The incompleteness of adjudication data makes it hard to explain the disparities among naturalization applications, Ryo said.
“To the extent that we want to understand and explain the disparities, it would be really important for the government to be accurately documenting the adjudicators’ reasons for denial in the first place,” she said.
In a separate article, “Denying Citizenship: Immigration Enforcement and Citizenship Rights in the United States,” Ryo penned a recommendation for governments to better document and more readily release information about naturalization denials to increase public understanding of the CBP’s decision-making process.
In addition to the missing data, another conspicuous challenge for the researchers are the inconsistencies in coding that existed in the database. It took an “enormous” amount of time for the researchers to decipher and reconcile discrepancies over time, a process that researchers called “data cleaning,” before they could proceed with their analysis.
“There were changes in how different variables were encoded over time and there was no documentation for that,” Humphrey said. “We really just had to be really careful that we were interpreting things correctly because [the USCIS] didn’t provide a lot of documentation on what things meant.”
The study garnered attention from USCIS who invited Ryo to brief the study, which Ryo said she is “thrilled” about. 
“That indicates willingness on the part of the agency that I think is really admirable, and willingness to learn and to see how they can improve their system,” Ryo said.

As gas prices skyrocket around the globe, commuter students like Ryan West have felt the holes in their pockets burn wider. 
“I don’t really have much time to work,” West said. “So the rising gas costs just eat into what money I do have.”
West, a freshman majoring in mechanical engineering, commutes from Fullerton several times a week. For West, who spends anywhere from “30 minutes and two hours” sitting in traffic, the increases have forced him to change his transportation habits. 
“With these prices, a half tank in my car is, I think, $30, and $60 for a full tank,” West said. “I’ve actually switched to riding a motorcycle as often as I can.”
The increase in gasoline prices comes from a variety of factors, including the declining coronavirus pandemic, record inflation and the recent conflict in Ukraine. The last time United States gas consumers faced similar surges in gas prices was during the 2008 financial crisis, where, after adjusting for inflation, gas averaged roughly $5.37 per gallon nationwide.  
This year, oil suppliers have clambered to meet the new post-pandemic demand for a recovering economy. It was not until U.S. lawmakers laid down international sanctions on Russian exports, however, that prices soared, coinciding with worries about global supply. 
Russia is one of the world’s premier exporters of oil, sending nearly eight million barrels of oil and other petroleum products to global markets in December. While the U.S. receives less than 10% of its oil from Russia, Europe gets upward of 60% and China another 20%. Since oil is priced on global commodity markets, the limitations on Russian oil affect prices around the world, regardless of its intended market. 
 Prices in California have stayed especially high even as national prices have started decreasing, with a new state average of $5.989 this week. California prices are naturally higher because of the state-mandated cleaner fuel blend, raising prices by 10 cents. But according to the New York Times, disruptions in the state supply chain have spurred bulk fuel prices to be upward of 80 to 90 cents higher per gallon than normal. 
In response, commuter students, like West, have opted to decrease their expenses where they can, cutting back on the “nonessentials.”
The switch to motorcycling has also proved fruitful for West, who said he pushes upward of 45 to 60 miles per gallon while riding, even 110 in select circumstances. This is compared to the national average MPG of 25.7 for motor vehicles in 2020. West also said he is cutting back on weekly trips to campus. 
Nilay Desai, who commutes from Culver City, echoed many of the same precautions as West in response to the high prices. 
“‘I’m a bit more considerate of where I’m going out to eat and stuff like that,” said Desai, a junior majoring in human development and aging. “I’ve definitely been cooking at home more recently.” 
While some in large cities have turned toward public transportation to reduce the financial strain, public transportation has proved largely ineffective in the Los Angeles area. Desai, who also works in the East L.A. Montebello area, said he found public transportation unable to meet his time-sensitive needs. 
“I have to go out there [Montebello] and then I’ll come back to USC … It doesn’t really make sense to use public transportation in that kind of sense.”  
West reiterated the same concerns, and said he’s considered public transportation, but for his schedule, it’s “not a viable option.” 
Despite the high transportation costs, most have continued to shy away from Zoom offerings in exchange for in-person instruction. 
“I could definitely see the advantage in that for certain classes,” West said, “But, in my opinion, for the most part, school is meant to be done in person.”
Amir Razipour, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, commutes from the Brentwood area and cited the high tuition fees against online alternatives. 
“Each day we go to class, that’s almost a $500 expense given tuition,” Razipour said. “A $15 gas trip for me is kind of insignificant compared to the tuition we face.”
West also said he has concerns about the city as a whole, as increased demand has pushed prices even higher excluding gas. 
“A lot of people travel far for work, namely L.A. commuters, and that’s why we get the rush hour traffic,” West said. “I definitely do think a lot of people are going to start considering what they can and can’t do, especially since a lot of people do live paycheck to paycheck.”

On April 4, Kim Kardashian’s shapewear, loungewear and underwear company, Skims, debuted its latest campaign, “Icon.” While the campaign’s products already existed, what made Skims take the internet by storm was who it featured: an ultimate Y2K lingerie revival. The four faces of the campaign were retired Victoria Secret Angels Candice Swanepoel, Heidi Klum, Tyra Banks and Alessandra Ambrosio — and if you haven’t heard of them, you definitely know their faces.
Each of the models are famous for their long and respected modeling career, all walking for major designers in Victoria’s Secret’s debut days. But, what truly launched them into stardom was their title as Victoria’s Secret Angel’s— when the brand still had its annual fashion show in the early 2000s. 
The Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show started in 1995 at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, and at first, it was just another fashion show. While it was more risque, considering the models strolled down the runway in only their lingerie, the show slowly gained more traction as theatrics transformed the VSFS from just another fashion show to one of the most anticipated events of the year. 
The shows took over major cities including Cannes, France, in 2000, London, England, in 2014 and Shanghai, China, in 2017. Music also changed from sound systems to live performances and backup dancers with artists such as Seal, Black Eyed Peas, Taylor Swift, Rihanna and The Weeknd. Models who booked the show had their life changed shortly after, and those who booked consistently were promoted to the title of “Angel.” Angels, dawned with handcrafted wings made by artists, got to wear multiple looks and were official brand ambassadors for Victoria’s Secret.
The Angels even went on a tour in 2004 after Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson’s wardrobe malfunction in the Super Bowl halftime show. Known as “nipplegate” or “Janetgate,” Jackson’s top broke and she accidentally flashed Timberlake, which led to public scrutiny of the brand and the security of their bras. Banks, Klum, Gisele Bundchen, Adriana Lima and Ambrosio traveled to NYC, Miami, Las Vegas and Los Angeles on their “Angels Across America Tour” to promote the brand for their 2005 show and salvage any bad press. 
But what was most exclusive and greatly increased press, was that being an Angel meant a chance of wearing the “Fantasy Bra” in the show; a bra that was custom made for the model and made exclusively out of crystals and diamonds which ranged from 1 million dollars (for Claudia Schiffer in 1996 and Elsa Hosk in 2019) to 15 million dollars (made for Gisele Bundchen in 2000). While the Fantasy Bra was included in catalogs from 1996, it only started its runway debut with Klum’s 12.5 million dollar “Heavenly Star Bra” in 2001. 
The show officially ended in 2018 after facing backlash for its numerous Photoshop errors, competition from other popular lingerie shops who were pushing a more modern agenda with body positivity and rejecting the male gaze at the forefront, as well as a stark decrease in viewership. 
Since then, Victoria’s Secret has made major changes to their business, bringing in other brands such as For Love and Lemons and changing their approach from “sexy bombshell” to “inclusive” and “empowering” with the announcement of their “VS collective” ambassadors. The ambassadors included Olympic athletes Megan Rapinoe and Eileen Gu, actress Priyanka Chopra, trans model Valentina Sampaio and recently Sofia Jirau, their first model with down syndrome.  
Although VS’ crown has fallen, it is undeniable that its golden era with its fashion shows greatly impacted the fashion world; photos of their exclusive airplane — the VSFS plane, which flew all the models to the show together — consumed Pinterest, the model’s street style and casting outfits were key in the early 2010 “effortless/less is more” trend and the re-emergence in beachy waves came with the dreamy and youthful hair and makeup created for the show. 
It was incredibly smart of Kim to bring these icons back, just like what Donatella Versace did with  Versace’s Spring 2018 collection and tribute to Gianni Versace, which saw a reunion of the ’90’s supermodels: Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Carla Bruni and Helena Christensen. 
Considering Skims’ appeal to a younger demographic compared to Versace, Skims’ smartly took advantage of the allure of VS Angels. After all, what the ’90s supermodels were to millennials are what the VS Angels are to Gen Z. 
While the campaign has already faced a bit of backlash — with a little too obvious photoshop on Banks’ body on Kim’s Instagram post — it will be interesting to see what the brand does next. 
Will Skims new campaign spark the next era of the new Victoria’s Secret? Or, will this “Icon” campaign be a one and done? I, for one, am extremely excited to see what, and who, their next campaign will feature — bible.

Josh Tillman, the man behind the stage name Father John Misty, released his fifth studio album Friday. The glamorously promoted “Chloë and the Next 20th Century,” preceded by months of cryptic video teasers on the artist’s Instagram, comes highly anticipated after a substantial hiatus from the studio and the internet. 
After a five-year-long mysterious disappearance from social media and a sizable gap in album releases, Misty’s exciting  impending return held all the importance of a prophet returning to proclaim the destiny of the world.
However, as the curtains pull back to reveal the sage himself, listeners discover a different Father John Misty than the one we last encountered. Head shaved of his characteristic mane and wild beard trimmed to a handsome cut, the so-called oldest man in folk rock seems to have transformed into the classiest man in Old Hollywood swing. 
This new look complements the narrative of “Chloë,” a surprising departure from Misty’s signature pessimism. The album’s masterful orchestration and grand symphonic backing replace the artist’s prior unhinged navigation through the benders of debauchery and the funtimes of folk rock. 
The album is an elaborate production, embracing the glamor and scale of early 20th century entertainment, and Misty leans into this role. He commits to the part, tossing out his old skin of a mushroom-loving madman and donning a neat suit and loafers instead to gracefully dance in. 
With its commanding string, lively piano and trumpeting intrepidity and a backing that holds a nearly equal share of the stage with Misty’s soulful crooning, the album creates its own shimmering world, inviting us into a timeless concert performance. Resigning Misty’s past efforts to stir up and poke fun with his music, “Chloë” sets off to achieve a more straightforward goal: to entertain.
The album opens with “Chloë,” immediately transporting us to 1920s Hollywood with its jazzy, swingy instrumentation and the tale it tells of the singer’s infatuation with a beautiful, yet unattainable woman. The sardonic twists are the only thing that betray the Tillman beneath the tuxedo. 
“Chloë is a borough socialist / She insists there’s not much more to it / Than drinks with a certain element / Of downtown art criticism,” sings Misty. Then, to finish the swell of the bridge, “Her soul is a pitch black expanse.”
Constant throughout the album are the singer’s woeful lamentations for a lover he continuously fails to attain. Though not an unfamiliar sentiment to Misty’s discography, “Chloë” provides a fresh twist on the narrative, telling it from the perspective of this performer of Hollywood’s golden age, remaining committed to the setting the album situates itself in.
The symphonic pizzazz remains present throughout the album, from the doleful saxophone solos of “Buddy’s Rendezvous” to the full-swing orchestral interlude of “Funny Girl.” So fully does “Chloë” embody the grandiloquence of the period it emulates, and so dutifully does Misty embody the heartsick crooner on stage, that the album nearly glosses over his occasional wry jousts at society.
Though not as overt, the sardonic wit in lyricism and general cynicism that Misty is known for still appear throughout the album — like flags Misty waves to remind us that he’s still the same Josh Tillman he always was, albeit groomed and tuxedoed. 
Not surprisingly tongue-in-cheek is the entirety of “Q4,” which jauntily tells the story of a writer who exploits the misery of their deceased sister with a “semi-memoir” which then tops the charts, earning reviews of “deeply funny.” So jubilant is the swelling of the symphony behind Misty, that his snide commentary on the exploitations that define our entertainment systems may initially be overlooked.
Stunning moments of lyrical wisdom are also snuck into the album’s stories of offered and refused affection, reminders of Misty’s strength in powerful lyricism, bettered by expert placement and delivery. 
“Only a Fool” boasts these strengths near the finale of an otherwise simple narrative. Misty sings of love making fools of us all, then posits, “The wisdom of the ages / From Gita to Abraham / Was written by smitten, lonely sages / Too wise to ever take a chance.”
In the strikingly vulnerable “Kiss Me (I Loved You),” Misty follows a fairly undecorated chorus with the beautiful line, “Love is much less a mystery / Than who you give it to.” 
These lyrical strong points offer just enough puncture to the Old Hollywood role Misty steps into, proving the depth behind this act of a humble performer on another era’s stage, showcasing Misty’s strengths without straying from the album’s exclusion of his cynical tendencies.
“Chloë” subdues Misty’s love of poking fun at our systems, reflecting a resignation to a perhaps futile pessimism. The album’s last track, “The Next 20th Century,” confirms the election for entertainment that pleasures over the condemnations of a society that will, unfortunately, not improved by anyone’s rage.
Despite Father John Misty’s many qualms with the way of things and his signature belief that there’s no hope in fixing them, “Chloë and the Next 20th Century” marks, if only temporarily, a resignation to his futile pushbacks, opting instead to provide entertainment along the rocky way with grand achievements in sound and timeless tales of being in love.

Wet Leg’s self-titled debut album shows a promising, fiery start, full of catchy new wave hits and silly, sometimes stupid, lyrics. The duo, composed of lead singer Rhian Teasdale and lead guitarist Hester Chambers, has embraced the chaos of life and translated it into short, bright tracks that make fun of everything from getting your degree to Diet Coke. 
The album’s fairly short runtime of 36 minutes and 49 seconds manages to pack in more than enough expletives to make your grandma blush. Yet, the refreshing honesty and inaneness of Teasdale’s writing make this a great carefree summer album. 
The track, “Being in Love,” opens the album off well with Teasdale’s airy voice layered over noisy guitars reflecting a slight shoegaze influence. Her knack for unique analogies is on display as she sings “I feel so uninspired / I feel like giving up / I feel like someone has punched me in the guts / I kinda like it cause it feels like being in love.”
Following this is a series of upbeat new wave tracks beginning, with viral hit “Chaise Lounge,” whose innuendo-laden lyrics garnered more than 13 million streams on Spotify before the album’s release. The entire song feels like a wink and nudge from your best friend as you silently laugh together about an inside joke.
Rather regrettably, Teasdale’s songwriting isn’t always the most polished. The bouncy guitars on “Angelica” are delightful, yet some of the lyrics can feel like a tired reflection of so-called “modern” life that many new indie bands fall victim to. On “Angelica,” she sings “I don’t wanna follow you on the gram / I don’t wanna listen to your band,” while on “Oh No,” she writes the unfortunately millennial-sounding line “You’re so woke / Diet Coke.”
Yet, in its pursuit of silliness, the duo has room for improvement. Its commitment to keeping the tracks fairly light, in both sound and lyrical content, is admirable and shows a commitment to their brand. However, this can occasionally feel as if the band falls short of silly sincerity and lands instead into corny, overdone territory. In “Angelica” and “Oh No,” the band tends toward rather bland references to so-called “modern” life in a reach for relatability.
A redeeming and endearing quality of “Wet Leg” is that you can tell Teasdale and Chambers are having pure, plain ol’ fun. The tracks move quickly and with momentum, exhibited in its single “Wet Dream.” Quite possibly the album’s zestiest song, “Wet Dream” features an addictive, foot-tapping beat combined with saucy lyrics such as, “You climb onto the bonnet, and you’re licking the windscreen / I’ve never seen anything so obscene / It’s enough to make a girl blush.” The track feels like summer, and that bottled joy is enough for anyone to love.
A standout moment on the album comes in the middle of “Ur Mum,” when Teasdale lets out a big scream after declaring, “OK, I’ve been practicing my longest and loudest scream / OK, here we go / One, two, three.” It shows Teasdale and Chambers’ playful side, and while it could have been a risky move for another band to include this, the scream fits right into their eccentric aesthetic. The song feels as if it was ripped straight from an early ’10s teen rom-com, and all the more power to them for it.
The album’s slower tracks are as tight and earnest as its more upbeat ones. “Loving You” features a dreamy opening with a simple drumbeat and Teasdale’s Clairo-like vocals layered into a mystical chorus. This sweet sound hides the bitter lyrics, yet their irritation and confusion tie the whole thing together. Teasdale sings, “I don’t wanna have to be friends / I don’t wanna have to pretend / I don’t wanna meet your girlfriend / Hope you choke on your girlfriend.” 
Similarly, the penultimate track, “Supermarket,” features slower, surf rock influenced guitar, with background vocals of a crowd that will make for a hand-clapping live experience. Again, the lyrics are sweet and domestic, and the metaphor of love in a supermarket conjures up images of racing down the aisles on shopping carts and laughing a little too loud in the cereal aisle.
Overall, Wet Leg’s debut album is silly in most of the right ways. Lucky for their listeners, Teasdale and Chambers have shown they aren’t afraid to burst onto the scene with their own brand of weirdness, and hopefully that also means they won’t be afraid to improve. So as we move into summer, filled with endless days of sunshine, happiness and moments of small silliness, this is the record that’ll be spinning right alongside us.

On March 30, USC custodial workers protested in USC Village, demanding higher livable wages and various insurance and healthcare benefits. A day later, custodial protestors went to Union Hall to, again, bring attention to the unlivable wages that their employer, Aramark, pays them. They marched once more on Thursday bringing the protest from Tommy Trojan to USC Village. 
The tireless care and work that USC’s custodial workers put into maintaining the cleanliness and aesthetic integrity of the University makes campus appear spotless. These janitorial workers risk their employment and livelihoods in choosing to speak up about poor work conditions and strike — USC students must show solidarity with them. 
Numerous custodial workers have worked at USC for more than 20 years. According to a March 31 Daily Trojan article, these employees lost USC-specific benefits and the right to send their children to USC without any charge to tuition because of an employer switch. Since working under Aramark, they have been without sufficient insurance for medication and affordable healthcare benefits. Aramark offered less than a 1% increase to their membership, which David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union United Service Workers West, deemed unacceptable.  
“We’re telling USC: You either pay up, make sure you pay these workers a just wage, make sure they have the benefits to be able to take care of their families,” said Huerta in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Everyone on USC’s campus anticipates a pristine cleanliness of classrooms and bathrooms. But what’s a clean bathroom when it means that janitors are overworked, underpaid, stripped of affordable healthcare benefits and unable to live a “dignified life”? 
We need to recognize the contributions custodial workers make on and off the clock. When they’re not hard at work at USC, they still have to provide for their families. If custodial workers aren’t given substantial wages to take care of their own families, it’s absurd for them to have to prioritize USC students to do so. 
If USC students don’t show that they appreciate custodians and deserve better, we’re sending a message that we’re content that they are underpaid and suffer at the expense of the economic priorities of Aramark and the University. As USC continues to raise tuition while letting their employees struggle, we must let janitors know that their work doesn’t go unseen. We must protest with them and let administration know that this is a collective issue that affects all of the University and South Central community. 
The USC Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation outlined a call-to-action guide for students to support custodians, including calling and emailing USC and Aramark officials to urge them to pay janitors livable wages, benefits and the support needed to care for their families. The least we can do is sign petitions and spread the cause via word of mouth and on social media. 
It’s inarguable that custodial workers at USC deserve more with all that they have done. From cleaning up all the mess we leave in McCarthy Quad to ensuring our campus is put together, the custodians on campus are a core component to the foundation of USC. Now, more than ever, it’s our turn to give back and show solidarity with them.

Wearing distinctive interpretations of “black, white, neutrals, blue and/or green” to fulfill the event’s dress code, an exuberant crowd of more than 125 students flocked into the basement of the USC Hotel Friday night,  all ready to watch an unforgettable night of fashion. 
Coordinated by ART/EMIS, a student-run intersectional feminist artistic club, the fashion show, “Next in Line,” featured 13 sustainable fashion pieces sourced from clothing at Goodwill. 
Marianne Zhou, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering who is a regular at ART/EMIS events, heard about the fashion show through the promotional posts on Instagram and showed up for the promise of a memorable night of interesting fashion. 
“I saw the ‘Next in Line’ Instagram posts of little teasers of different things that are going to be in the show,” said Zhou. “They were so interesting … super out-of-the-box fashion ideas.” 
Ashley Taylor, a freshman majoring in music industry, started the night with an hour-long set full of R&B covers and original songs. For Isobel Smith, a sophomore majoring in international relations and journalism, Taylor’s performance added another layer of student talent to the night. 
“Seeing a student band perform before we saw all of [the student models] really set the mood,” she said. “It was really great to hear a different type of music before we went into the high-paced music of the show.” 
Following Taylor’s set, the audience sat primed and ready for the show to begin. Student models soon stormed the runway to a mix created by Ocean Saints, associate producer for “Next in Line” Tony Marez’s DJ duo. Each of the 13 models wore a unique, sustainable look crafted to fit their body by a student designer. 
Attendees sat around the green LED-lit runway just inches away from the pieces, allowing them to see the intricate details visible on each look. With a variety of looks, from delicate and pale colored fairy-esque dresses to large red pants, there was truly a crowd-pleasing moment for everyone. For Shwetha Ganesh, Muriel Clarke’s silver chain piece, featuring silver chain necklaces and a chain-like skirt and crop top, modeled by Ire Burks, was the show’s standout piece. 
“I loved it,” said Ganesh, a senior majoring in international relations and global economics.  “I’m definitely going to try to change my fashion up a little inspired by this outfit.” 
With the show composed of various unique and different looks, the diversity in pieces initially worried creative director Lina Rehbein, a sophomore majoring in environmental studies. However, the designers’ individuality ended up adding to the evening. 
“We knew that there was going to be so many different directions,” she said. “That turned out to be the most rewarding part of the show, seeing how everybody’s creative vision took them to a unique place and how beautiful, in their own way, each piece really was”. 
The evening, filled with good energy and unique fashion looks, made some in the enthusiastic crowd excited to come back to future ART/EMIS events. Ganesh plans to continue to support ART/EMIS and attend future events. 
“I wasn’t super familiar with [ART/EMIS] before the fashion show,” Ganesh said. “But now that I know, I definitely will support as much as I can, even as a post-grad.” 
A common sentiment among attendees was an appreciation for the diverse group of models, all portraying different looks and body types. The model selection was a conscious choice by the ART/EMIS team, Rehbein said. 
“This project was about getting a bunch of creative people together, and really appreciating everyone’s diversity and thought,” she said. “Each model was selected based on how much they embodied the creative energy of the piece that person was creating. And, because those were so different, we had such an amazing, beautiful range of models up there on the runway.” 
ART/EMIS’ accurate representation of the USC student body improved the overall quality of the show, Zhou said.
“It was really refreshing to see because, in general media, there is always the same kind of models, the same kind of clothing, and especially in high fashion,” Zhou said. “It’s really cool to see everybody represented and see everybody looks so great, too.”

Jenette McCurdy, filmmaker, writer and perhaps best known as the legendary butter sock swinger, Sam Puckett from “iCarly,” released her new book: “I’m Glad My Mom Died.” Although the memoir officially  comes out Aug. 9, I envy the writer’s ability to unpack her own experiences in childhood. On YouTube, McCurdy opened up about her abusive relationship with her mother led her to develop an eating disorder, something she continues to work through everyday. 
The ways in which our parents and caretakers have conditioned us — or failed to condition us — throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood seep into our entire perception of the world. Attachment theory, a well-known and powerful tool in psychology, is something everybody should explore. At its core, it’s the idea that our relationships are grounded in our childhood bonds with our parents or caretakers.
Attachment theory originally focused on mother-infant bonding, but in recent decades, research has multiplied to explore how those attachments are inextricably linked with our natural tendencies in relationships throughout adulthood. According to Victoria A. Fitton in her article, “Attachment Theory: History, Research, and Practice,” there has been a shift from “theory related to physiological needs toward a theory of primary instinctual responses which function to promote social interaction.” 
A simplified model of Attachment Theory by The Attachment Project helps us understand how different attachment styles affect people in their romantic relationships. My therapist blurting out that I have attachment style issues felt transformative. Aside from being a little too well-versed in “Daddy Issues” by The Neighbourhood, I never really had an understanding of what my childhood meant for my identity, or how to process and make sense of it. 
I understand now that feeling disconnected and neglected by my parents throughout my childhood translates into various aspects of my life: how I perceive myself, how I crave romance and affection and how I feel most beautiful when someone pretty is by my side. It translates into my relationships and how I feel broken and helpless when people pull away. 
The point of attachment theory is not to tuck our childhood away into a category, nor is it to angrily shove it in a wooden memory box with the view that our parents are the result of all our issues and there is nothing we can do about it. Attachment theory is a lens of understanding, one which gives space for the experiences I have and leaves room for me to unpack and address them. 
With this introspection, I can also understand the sobering reality of context. Just as I feel I had “daddy issues,” I know my dad had issues far worse than mine. In his childhood, to have food on the table and not be physically abused for one night was his idea of security, far and disparate from mine. I realize now, after years of being angry, that my parents did their part. They came to America and created generational change to the extent that was imaginable to them. 
Now, I have a responsibility to carry it forward and acknowledge that my childhood may not have been everything I wanted it to be, and to find solace in the little and big ways in which my parents have shown up for me. It is allowing myself the possibility of being happy without the company of anyone else. It is rebuilding a relationship with my parents, at my own pace, with what I am willing to give. Something as simple as sending my mom my daily Wordle and doing my best to call my parents. 
Anger is a step in the process of healing. I felt angry at my parents for years. Frankly, without that, without validating my own pain, without understanding what I never experienced, what I missed out on, I can’t really understand myself. 
When I was a kid, I fixated on growing up and moving on. But now, I know that my childhood will always shape my perception of the big blue world, and remarkably so, my dreams are simpler than ever. I want to play with chalk and blow some bubbles. I’m grateful to be having these realizations at the age of 19. 
While I can’t change how my parents raised me, I find glory in my reality: My childhood is still actively being shaped. I have the opportunity to pinpoint my pain and work through it. To meld missed experiences into future exploration and expression. To be raw and vulnerable to others and find peace in the process. To challenge my own past relationship with my body and how I seek happiness from others.
The thing that once made me feel so broken is now the thing that brings me intel as to what I want from the life I live. What’s more beautiful than that?

I think of myself as a theatre kid who can’t sing, dance or act. In spite of my lack of talent, growing up, I was privileged enough to immerse myself in theatre. I lived vicariously through my sister’s high school plays and my mom’s college stories as a theatre major. Every birthday or holiday wish list always included tickets to shows.
However, my love for theatre isn’t quite enough to keep them successfully running. Following the 2008 recession, theaters received less government and corporate funding, turning toward the earned income model that depends on ticket sales and subscriptions. In fact, the 2019 Theatre Facts report found that, on average, theaters had to earn more than half of their budget. 
Unsurprisingly, this model dealt massive blows to theaters during the pandemic when no one could attend shows. Gary Grossman, the artistic director of the Skylight Theater Company in Los Angeles, said it will take three to five years for his theater to get back financially to where it was prepandemic. 
Coronavirus exacerbated an already growing problem: Nonprofit theaters cannot rely on earned income while maintaining general accessibility. Instead, they need government support and a society that values the broader cultural and community benefits of these organizations. 
According to the New York Times, in 2019, an average ticket on Broadway, home to for-profit theaters, costs $124. In comparison, in 2018, Second Stage, a nonprofit theater also in New York, offered subscription packages for three shows at an average ticket price of $83.33 per show. Even now, a glance at their website shows tickets ranging from $69 to $125 for the show “To My Girls” and $79 to $199 for “Take Me Out.” While most often less expensive than Broadway, these shows still come with a large price tag, limiting who attends. 
As organizations with tax-exempt status, nonprofit theaters should contribute to the community and make art more affordable for everyone. Yet, using tickets and subscriptions to stay afloat leads to an increase in prices. SMU DataArts reports that the more seats performing arts organizations fill with subscribers, the less racial and income diversity of the audience. During the 2018 to 2019 season, Broadway audiences were 74% white, with an average annual household income of $261,000 and an average age of 42.3 years old. A for-profit theater seeks to turn a profit for shareholders — which does not incentivize accessibility. So, where the for-profit sector fails, the nonprofit has a chance to bring art to communities who otherwise could not afford it. 
In Boston, the nonprofit theater group Company One prices tickets at about $20, with two-thirds of the audience receiving tickets through a “pay what you want” system. It found that 40% of its audience identified as Black, Indigenous, and people of color compared to 11% of audiences in the rest of Boston. Additionally, 55% of its audience is under 35 years old compared to 25% throughout the rest of the city. How does Company One do this? Since it focuses on government support, earned income makes up only 20% of its budget, allowing them to slash ticket prices. 
In 2020, California passed AB5, mandating that all theaters pay minimum wage, plus payroll taxes, workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance to their staff and artists. For context, Martha Demson, the board president of the Theatrical Producers League of L.A., said the law will add $193,500 in labor costs to Open First Theater Company’s usual budget of around $200,000 to $250,000. 
Taylor Gilbert, founder of Road Theater Company, perfectly summarizes the conundrum: While theaters support paying their artists a living wage, many fear they do not have the budget to implement it. To be clear, I fully support paying and protecting people who work in theatre. But, at this point, nonprofit theaters cannot be fully accessible and fairly compensate workers on their own. That’s where the government comes in. 
After theater companies successfully campaigned, Governor Gavin Newsom signed a one-time $50 million subsidy to financially assist nonprofit theaters smaller than 99 seats last July. As California ranked 28th in state arts funding on a per capita basis before the pandemic, this subsidy is a great start. However, theaters need continued support from the government. 
Theatre communities are now advocating for SB 1116, or The Performing Arts Equitable Payroll Fund. Advocates say that the bill creates a grant program to “support California performing workers directly” by paying for some of the new payroll expenses incurred by AB5. The bill would provide the greatest support to the smallest organizations, helping theaters remain accessible while also paying a living wage. 
While there could be hesitation to contributing tax-dollars to theatre, this mindset fails to understand its inherent value. Theatre brings new perspectives and experiences to the stage, highlighting community and creativity while tying the audience together in a singular, unique experience.
There’s no way for me to fully describe watching the curtains slowly open at the start of a show, driving around my neighborhood belting musicals with my sister and stifling tears in the darkness of a playhouse during an emotional scene. Theatre is an artform that everyone who wishes to, regardless of the size of their wallet, should be able to experience.
