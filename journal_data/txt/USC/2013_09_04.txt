With a team featuring an offense that passes about 70 times a game looming ahead on the schedule, redshirt junior safety Josh Shaw is particularly excited about playing Washington State on Saturday.
The heavy pass attack will put a lot of pressure on the secondary, but Shaw said the team looked ready after practice Wednesday, adding that Washington State coach Mike Leach’s trademark aerial attack will serve as a litmus test for the Trojans’ relatively inexperienced secondary.
“Their quarterback [redshirt junior Connor Halliday] has a strong arm, and he can make all the throws, so we have our work cut out for us,” Shaw said. “They’re definitely gonna come out here and pass the ball, so we’ll see where our secondary stands.”
Though still less than 100 percent healthy, redshirt junior Dion Bailey should rotate around with Shaw and freshman Su’a Cravens at the two safety spots. Bailey added that all three should get on the field if the team runs a nickel package.
A bevy of cornerbacks are expected to continue to split playing time, including redshirt senior Torin Harris, redshirt junior Anthony Brown, sophomore Kevon Seymour and freshman Devian Shelton.
UPSET ALERT
Though Washington State is considered to be one of the weaker teams in the Pac-12, the Trojans say they are not overlooking the Cougars. Instead of facing several non-conference teams to start the schedule, USC drives right into conference play and is viewing the Cougars like any other opponent.
“We’re not underestimating them to any degree,” redshirt senior defensive end Devon Kennard said. “I think they’re a very good team. Watching them on film, they do a lot of things really well. They get the ball out quick, and they’re gonna challenge us with their offensive line, so we have to come ready.”
While the Cougars looked less than stellar last week in a 31-24 loss against Auburn, who finished 3-9 last season and fired coach Gene Chizik as a result, there is no doubt in the team’s mind that overlooking Washington State could lead to an upset.
Bailey said that he hadn’t even noticed that USC had dropped a spot in the rankings and that they were not going to let anything about their place in the polls get in their heads, citing that the team may have come in overconfident last year as the AP preseason        No. 1 pick.
“I guess you could say that we just fed into it [last year],” Bailey said.
Long time HOMECOMING
Redshirt senior defensive end Devon Kennard has a little more pep in his step this week in practice.
Most players are looking forward to returning to the Coliseum on Saturday. For freshmen, it will be the first time any of them compete before a USC student section.
“There’s nothing like playing under the lights in the Coliseum,” Shaw said. “The tradition, the experience for a lot of young guys like Su’a [Cravens]… It’s gonna be a great experience, and I’m excited to go out there and display great defense out there in front of our fans.”
But for Kennard, the game represents the end of a long journey. Injured with a torn pectoral all of last year, Kennard will be appearing in his home stadium for the first time since 2011.
“Every opportunity you get to play in the Coliseum is very special, and it’s been a while,” Kennard said. “[But] I’m gonna try and stay even-keeled. No game is bigger than any other game.”
Kennard looked great against Hawai’i last week as one of the leaders in tackles. With the switch to the 5-2 defense, he seems to have finally found his natural position as a hybrid outside linebacker. For his efforts against the Warriors, Kennard was named the Ronnie Lott IMPACT Player of the Week.
All quiet on the QB Front 
The headlines stayed the same after Thursday’s practice, as there is still no word on who will be the starting quarterback in Saturday’s game.
Reports indicate that Cody Kessler, not Max Wittek, will be tabbed to start again and receive a vast majority of the reps against Washington State, but Kiffin and his players did not confirm or deny anything.
Kiffin also declined to say if senior running back Silas Redd practiced. If he stays inactive as he was last week, redshirt sophomore Tre Madden and freshman Justin Davis will support the two quarterbacks from the tailback spot. Last week against Hawai’i, the pair combined for 183 yards on 32 carries, with Davis providing the lone rushing touchdown of the night for either team.

It always used to go something like this: USC would play two or three nonconference games and then shift over to conference play, not facing an opponent outside of the Pac-10 for the rest of the season, save for Notre Dame.
It had a sort of fluidity to it. Though those nonconference games counted in terms of rankings and history, they were a preseason of sorts, allowing teams to get clicking before starting conference play.
But then, something happened in 2011.
USC opened the season against Minnesota, then hosted new Pac-12 school Utah before another nonconference game against Syracuse.
Last year offered a return to normalcy, as the Trojans took on Hawai’i and Syracuse before turning their attention to conference play.
Yet this year we are back to the random conference game in the middle of the nonconference slate, this time in the form of Washington State.
The Cougars are usually terrible — USC head coach Lane Kiffin actually referred to USC’s 2010 matchup against WSU as a “preseason” game — but they are a conference team nonetheless, and in the standings, a win over them counts — just as much as one over Stanford.
People, this is wrong.
Coaches always used to refer to their first few games, the nonconference games, as the “preseason.” I always thought that this was a poor choice of words, as the games absolutely counted.
But I knew what they meant: Ultimately, it’s conference games that matter most, and the nonconference schedule was used to prepare for conference play. It was, in fact, a preseason of sorts.
Thanks to myriad reasons, such as TV, money and TV money, that is no longer the case.
Think USC’s schedule is funky? Try those of SEC teams Mississippi and Vanderbilt, who opened their seasons against each other last Saturday. The same goes for ACC squads Florida State and Pittsburgh.
“It’s all mixed up,” USC redshirt sophomore quarterback Cody Kessler said. “You think you get two or three quote-unquote preseason games before you get to the conference games. But our schedule’s just different this year.”
Last year Miami and Boston College started ACC play in week one, as did Vanderbilt and South Carolina in the SEC.
Again, this is wrong.
Conference games aren’t meant to be contested in the August and September heat. They’re meant for the dead of fall in October.
The early-season schedule is for nonconference matchups such as Georgia and Clemson this year, Michigan and Alabama a year ago, and Oregon and LSU in 2011. Those are constantly some of the most fun games of the year to watch.
But it’s about more than fun. Watching Oregon run all over an FCS team for the fourth year in a row is decidedly not entertaining.
Yet somehow it feels more right than watching a conference game in week one. Plus, there’s always that slim chance that someone pulls an Appalachian State-over-Michigan type stunner that makes it all worth it.
The Ducks played Nicholls State this past Saturday. They won by 63 points. It was stupid. It was a terrible game in every respect. In many ways, it was a crime against football.
And yet it still wasn’t as heinous as the matchup between Ole Miss and Vanderbilt, which was actually a very good game, decided on a touchdown with just 67 seconds remaining.
I watched that game, and yes, it was exciting — much more exciting than watching Oregon bludgeon Nicholls State. But there was something intrinsically wrong about watching two in-conference teams go at it in the opening week of the season.
And this Saturday at the Coliseum will be no different, watching the Trojans play Washington State, and knowing that it’s not Cal or Arizona or even Colorado that comes up next, but rather Boston College and Utah State.
Aside from great nonconference rivalries, such as USC and Notre Dame or Florida and Florida State, conference games should only come after all nonconference games have been played.
Yet next year it looks like the Trojans will have the same setup. The Pac-12 schedule for the 2014 season hasn’t been made, but USC is set to host Fresno State in the opener and then travel to Boston College in week three, meaning week two could be a conference game.
Let’s hope it ends up being a bye week.

Former USC men’s basketball center Dewayne Dedmon has signed a partially guaranteed contract with the Golden State Warriors, according to USA Today.
Slam dunk · Former USC center Dewayne Dedmon’s rim-shattering dunks were impressive, but he never developed an intricate post game. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Dedmon decided to forego his senior season and enter the NBA draft even after the arrival of new head coach Andy Enfield, whose high-speed offensive system could have capitalized upon Dedmon’s skill set.
In his junior season, the 7-footer averaged 6.7 points while leading the 14-18 Trojans with 7.0 rebounds per game, 2.1 blocks per game and 1.1 steals per game, impressive for a big man.
But foul trouble limited Dedmon’s effectiveness, as he committed the most personal fouls (93) of any Trojan last season while playing only 22.3 minutes per game.
Before Dedmon even stepped on the court for the Trojans, former USC coach Kevin O’Neill predicted the Lancaster, Calif. native would be a first-round pick in the NBA. That prediction didn’t prove true — Dedmon went undrafted in June’s NBA Draft after being ranked 74th among ESPN draft expert Chad Ford’s list of 2013 prospects.
Dedmon is considered to be extremely raw, especially on offense, as he didn’t begin to play organized basketball until he was 18 years old. He grew up a Jehovah’s Witness and obeyed his mother’s wishes that he focus on his religion rather than sports, despite his impressive height. He transferred to USC after playing one season at Antelope Valley College.
Though his ascent to the NBA is inspiring, it hasn’t always been smooth: Dedmon and backup center James Blasczyk were suspended from the team near the end of the 2012-13 season following an alleged fight in Spokane, Wash.
The Warriors burst into the spotlight during the 2013 NBA playoffs when they upset the Denver Nuggets in the first round before falling to the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals. Dedmon will compete with players such as David Lee, Andrew Bogut, Jermaine O’Neal, Festus Ezeli and Marreese Speights for a spot in the frontcourt.

The USC men’s water polo team enters the 2013 season the way they ended the last, as the No. 1 team in the nation, at least according to the preseason Collegiate Water Polo Association poll. After winning their fifth consecutive NCAA championship last year with a dramatic 11-10 win over crosstown rival UCLA to cap off a perfect 29-0 record, the Trojans have renewed expectations of a national title under 12-time National Coach of the Year Jovan Vavic.
With the opening matches right around the corner, Vavic can’t wait to begin the quest for a sixth consecutive championship with yet another loaded team at his disposal.
Head above water · Senior two-meter Jeremy Davie (2) earned All-American Honorable Mention and was named All-MPSF First Team last season after scoring 29 goals for the Trojans, good for fifth on the team. – Daily Trojan file photo
“I feel pretty good about our team since we have a strong recruiting class and a strong group of seniors with the majority of our starting unity coming back,” Vavic said. “We also have a good amount of experience now playing against top-notch international competition.”
The program, which hasn’t lost a match since 2011, kicks off its season at the UCSD Triton Invitational this weekend in La Jolla, Calif. USC will be playing six matches over the course of two days and will be facing some premier opponents.
Five of their first six matches come against teams that are currently ranked or were ranked in last year’s NCAA Division I polls.
“We are going to take no one lightly and everyone’s going to be after us so we are just going to have to take it game by game,” senior utility player Mace Rapsey said. “We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves. [We’ll] stay focused and see what happens.”
After carrying such a large target on their back in previous years, the nation’s other top water polo teams won’t have to wait long to get a shot at dethroning the defending champions. The Trojans will have two early-season tests as they take on UCLA and California, who were second and fourth, respectively, in the preseason CWPA poll. Stanford, another Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference foe, is currently third in the rankings.
Though both of these matches are being played as scrimmages, they will be great indicators of whether a top-ranked team will be able to even compete with USC, which brings back five All-Americans and four of its five top scorers from last year. Reigning National Player of the Year Nikola Vavic scored 83 goals last year and stands just 48 goals away from the USC’s all-time record.
UCLA and Cal finished second and third, respectively, in the NCAA Division I rankings at the end of the 2012 campaign.
UCLA returns four starters, led by all-conference honoree Paul Reynolds, who ranked third in goals scored (41) for the Bruins last season.
California senior Collin Smith, one of the Bears’ five returning All-Americans, led his team with 61 goals and 31 assists.
Though UCLA and Cal are the notable matches of the weekend, the Trojans will also take on Cal Baptist and Loyola Marymount on Saturday, followed by Air Force and Redlands on Sunday.
With six games jam-packed into 29 hours, Vavic expects many underclassmen to get some playing time.
“At this point, this team is experienced, but we need some younger players who haven’t played a major role these last few years to step up,” Vavic said.
Vavic’s words apply to freshman Jon Walters, who led Mater Dei High School to two CIF titles and will have to prove he’s ready for the collegiate game this weekend.
“I’m spending a lot of time learning our system and our plays, and I’m just going to continue to work hard in order to play a role on this team somehow,” Walters said.
Nagging injuries commonly derail a team’s championship aspirations. Fortunately for USC, there are no injuries to worry about right now.
“Everyone is good to go,” Vavic said of the team’s health.
The Trojans will play their first game of the Triton Invitational and of the season against Cal Baptist on Saturday at 1 p.m. and conclude the weekend with the scrimmage against the Bruins at 6 p.m. on Sunday.

The Pizza Studio, a pizza restaurant located on Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard, will reach 94 locations a year after the original opened. The idea for the Pizza Studio began in an environment far removed from a kitchen. Samit Varma, an alumnus of the USC Marshall School of Business, remembered making pizza in his mom’s kitchen during his time serving in the Navy. When he left and worked for a venture capital firm, he dreamed of returning to pizza-making one day. His dream became a reality after he received his MBA from USC, and opened the first Pizza Studio with his partner Ron Biskin last January.
Buon appetito · At Pizza Studio, customers are encouraged to create their own unique pizza. They can build their own, starting with the crust and extending to toppings that include bacon and broccoli. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Quickly, the team decided to build five more. Then, the business began to expand as a franchise. By the time the original Pizza Studio celebrates its first anniversary in early 2014, there will be locations around the country, from San Diego to Kansas.
Varma says one of his models for success is the burrito franchise Freebirds, which first opened near the campus of the University of California at Santa Barbara. He has found USC to be a similarly nurturing community.
“The USC community has been great and very supportive,” Varma said. “We have had students, faculty and staff write many letters of appreciation and praise. USC is ground zero for what could be a major U.S. brand for pizza.”
The support of the USC community has not come solely in the form of their ability to eat pizza. Some students have submitted topping and restaurant ideas through rating apps and social media, which Varma has incorporated into the restaurant.
“The roasted corn was brought in from a student’s recommendation on Yelp,” he said. “We did our normal process of testing, and now it’s on the topping bar.”
According to Varma, a few months into business, some students suggested that the Pizza Studio offer online ordering to accommodate their busy schedules and perpetual desire to enjoy fast pizza. After a few months, the students’ wish was granted as the Pizza Studio rolled out a platform for ordering pizza online.
“Having a place to eat that adapts and incorporates the ideas from their customers is the best way to make your establishment improve,” John Vitzileos, a freshman majoring in international relations, said. “It is also cool to have a place that will cater to the needs of the students like online ordering that can allow for quick pick-up.”
Varma says that as an alumnus, it was important to begin his journey at USC.
“I think pizza is one of those foods that’s a very universal food — anyone from kids to adults, everyone loves pizza,” he said. “We wanted to start it near USC because I have an affinity for USC and know the area.”
The Pizza Studio has also had an impact on the surrounding community. Through the Starving Artist project, which features artists’ work on the walls of each restaurant, the Pizza Studio has sold more than $3,000 worth of art at the Figueroa location.
USC students and alumni alike are involved in the project. Latanya Seale, receptionist at USC’s MBA Career Services, heard about the project from Biskin when she was at the Pizza Studio. She passed the word onto her son Michael, who ended up selling one of his pieces to a graduate of USC’s Gould School of Law.
Varma thinks that the USC restaurant provides a valuable model for the future of the business.
“The success we’re having at USC will translate to suburban and urban environments because the nature of this business is to be disruptive — this is not an experience that has been available before,” he said.
The Pizza Studio misrepresents employment terms in job postings and via conversations with their company’s executives! During open interview hours their staff rudely tells you to leave their store and come back when they open to the public, etc. Unethical, lack of integrity, are some of the words I would use to describe my experience with this Alumni owned business! The Pizza Studio is not a very good representative of USC Alumni owned companies!
SC alumni got business acumen!

The USC School of Social Work has received a $5 million grant from the Department of Defense Education Activity to develop tablet and smartphone apps that can help smooth the school transition process for military children enrolled in public schools.
This new initiative, known as “Welcoming Practices that Address Transition Needs of Military Students in Public Schools,” can help families complete enrollment forms, find tutoring programs and provide local district contacts who can answer additional questions. The app can also help families find access to special education or link student athletes with coaches.
Ron Astor, a professor at the USC School of Social Work and Rossier School of Education, will be leading the project along with co-principal investigator, Tamika Gilreath, an assistant professor in the School of Social Work.
Chula Vista elementary school district, along with four other military-affiliated school districts in San Diego and Riverside counties will also be involved in the development and use of the new app.
For the past three years, Astor has been involved with Building Capacity, a project that focuses on improving the school social climate, including issues such as bullying, in military-connected schools. The initiative places master’s of social work students into schools as interns and mentors.
“We are trying to listen to the kids and address their greatest needs,” Astor said of Building Capacity.
Monica Esqueda, a fifth-year graduate student at Rossier, has been involved with the research aspect of Building Capacity and will also play a part in the development of the new app.
Esqueda notes the significance of addressing the transition needs of children, especially those who experience a lot of mobility.
“Transition is a critical time point, even during scheduled transitions, for example from elementary to middle school. If transitions are not handled well, there can be consequences, including behavioral [ones],” Esqueda said. “In military children who can experience up to six to nine unscheduled transitions, these effects can be amplified.”
The overall goal of the program is to make students feel comfortable in their school environment.
“We want every child, every family to feel welcome every time they go to a new school,” Astor said.
Many USC students agree that the transition between schools can be hard, no matter the age of the student.
“As an international student from China, it took some time for me to get used to everything here in the U.S. I think the app is a really good way to help students get used to the surroundings,” Yahui Zhou, a first-year graduate student studying chemical engineering, said. “If there was an app like that for international students, I would use it.”
Some even believe a similar app could be useful to all college students.
“I know that when I came in as a transfer I didn’t know where I was so I downloaded a map,” Mady Renn, a sophomore majoring in English, said. “Little things you don’t really think of to ask at orientation, just the everyday troubles, would be helpful to have in an app.”
Though the new app is designed specifically for military children, it can also help any grade school student who is having a tough time transitioning.

A recently released USC Rossier School of Education and Policy Analysis for California Education (PACE) poll indicates that Californians still strongly support standardized testing as an indicator of the success of both students and teachers.
The poll, conducted in both English and Spanish online from Aug. 27-30, surveyed more than 1,000 registered California voters. It asked questions about standardized testing, teacher performance and the effect Gov. Jerry Brown has had on education.
“Most of the political experts say that parents think their children are tested too frequently, but our poll shows just the opposite,” Dan Schnur, poll director and director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics, said in a press release.
Only 25 percent of parents with school-aged children said the state should test students less, 66 percent advocated for testing in each grade level.
Many voters also believed that teachers’ jobs and salaries should be dependent on standardized testing.
A slight majority of voters said that paying teachers more for successful test performance would improve public education. A plurality also said that if a school fails, teachers are the main party to blame.
There was less of a solid trend in voters’ opinions on Brown’s contributions to the state’s education system. Forty-two percent of voters approved of his handling of education,  46 percent disapproved.
More than 60 percent of voters, however, said they were not very familiar with the policies Brown has enacted, specifically a new funding formula. Brown’s Local Control Funding Formula aims to fund schools based on need, increasing funding to districts with many English Language Learners and low-income students. Another 71 percent of voters polled claimed ignorance about the Common Core State Standards California that he has implemented.
Voters were also asked whom they would choose among Brown and three potential Republican challengers. Brown won all three matchups by wide margins.

Students gathered in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Wednesday night for the Town hall Forum on Campus Security, a  debate on issues of campus security, sexual violence and racial profiling at USC.
Heated discourse· Students Makiah Green, Kaya Masler and Sam Couch served as members of the opposition in the debate on DPS’s newly enacted policies. The panel consisted of eight students and a moderator. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
The debate was moderated by Assistant Provost for Student Advocacy Lynette Merriman and included an eight-person student panel. The students all had expertise in the subjects discussed.
The event was hosted by USC Program Board, Political Student Assembly, Black Student Assembly, Latino Student Assembly, Women’s Student Assembly, USG Advocacy, the Trojan Debate Club, College Republicans and College Democrats.
Kyron Richard, of the Political Student Assembly, Peter Wyche, of the Political Student Assembly, Stephanie Aristakesian, director of the concerts committee and Jeff Salamone-Callahan, of the Trojan Parliamentary Debate Club defended the university’s current practices and protocols as necessary and appropriate.
Melissa Villafranco, one of the co-directors of the Women’s Student Assembly, Sam Couch of KXSC, Makiah Green, of the USC Change Movement and Kaya Masler, the other co-director of the Women’s Student Assembly argued that the current security practices and protocols both infringe upon the rights of students and separate the university from the surrounding community.
The panel addressed the question of whether or not USC security policies adequately address crime.
“The university policies have made campus safer, as there has been a 95 percent decrease in campus crime. The university has an obligation, first and foremost, to its students,” Wyche, a senior majoring in economics/mathematics, said. “After 9 p.m. there is little reason for non-USC students to be on campus.”
The other side rebutted that the problem with the security policies was that they were created unilaterally, without student input. This led to the discussion of the issue of whether the new USC security policies enable, rather than inhibit student life and involvement.
Aristakesian spoke  the necessity for the increased security. She used her personal experience planning and executing Welcome Week concert to support her beliefs.
“It was one of the first times that it was absolutely necessary that we had fencing and CSC and DPS as well as paramedics on site,” Aristakesian said. “The crowd gets really rowdy, so it’s very necessary to have the officers there to moderate the crowd. Throughout the night there were one or two people who needed to be sent to the hospital, and without those extra officers and paramedics, students would not have received the medical attention that they needed.”
The opposing side argued that though the safety of students is important, the extra measures that are now mandatory for all student groups and events, such as the ones taken at the concert, create a financial burden.
Couch, a senior majoring in computer science, explained how the new security mandates create excessive monetary issues in hosting events.
“We think that, coming from independent student organizations that don’t receive guaranteed monetary support, it affects our ability to operate business as usual,” Couch said. “We don’t have the budget to comply and it seems unfair that the burden of the extra security is placed on the organizations.”
Kyron Richard, a sophomore majoring in international relations, argued that student safety should come before a perceived price tag.
“I’m pro-fencing [around the university],” Richard said. “When you see the numbers in reduced thefts and building incidents, you can see that not everyone on campus should have access to everyone’s living spaces and stuff.”
The student discussion that followed the debate focused on the issues of student experiences with sexual abuse and racial discrimination and how the university has dealt with these issues.
Villafranco emphasized that though USC has programming for freshmen during Welcome Week, which addresses sexual harassment and assault, the school does not continue that effort later in students’ time at USC.
“USC is doing a lot to address sexual assaults, but we need to make sure these conversations are continued throughout the year,” Villafranco said.
One audience member sparked a conversation about safety on campus in spite of perceived racial discrimination on campus. Several students shared stories of discrimination they had experienced on campus — from fellow students as well as DPS and LAPD officers.
“The USC community is safe if you get to know the people you’re living around,” Rayven Vinson, a senior majoring international relations and Spanish, said. “For my experience, I was one of those people on May 4 that was arrested, and while I was taken to the ground by LAPD officers, DPS just watched.”
This brought up the issue of the overall race-sensitive environment at USC.
“I love my school, and I would love to encourage more minorities to attend USC,” Makiah Green, a graduate student in the master’s of professional writing program, said. “But I can’t look a black student in the eye and tell him to come here because of the climate of discrimination.”
Overall, the debate and discussion sought to begin an extensive dialogue to discuss these and many more issues at USC. At the close of the discussion, the moderators concluded by instructing all listeners to reflect on the issues and think about further topics to bring to the attention of the USC community.
 
Correction: A published version of this incorrectly stated that Peter Wyche is a graduate student majoring in mathematical finance. Wyche is a undergraduate student majoring in economics/mathematics. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.

I’m glad this discussion is ongoing and that parents can now enter campus to check on their kids at anytime with a phone call to proper department
Just wait for Nikias’ secret UAV program to come to light
Couple of minor notes…I’m an undergraduate, won’t be starting the graduate program until January. More importantly, the quote is off a bit–according to DPS Captain Allegre, there has been a 95% reduction in on-campus crime after 9 PM since the fences went up, not an overall 95% reduction. The official statistics won’t be published until August, from what I understand.

In acoustics, the term “white noise” designates an audio signal containing all frequencies of sound audible to the human spectrum, in the same way that in optics “white light” designates light containing all frequencies of light visible in the human spectrum. Similarly, the term “black noise,” while it might sound harsh, would in fact mean complete silence.
“Black Noise,” the final track on Nine Inch Nails’ newest album, Hesitation Marks, illustrates this concept perfectly. The same synth from the previous track loops over and over, underscored by a foreboding crescendo of mechanical noise. The noise slowly overtakes every other element of the track, building and building until suddenly, it cuts away to silence — the true black noise.

From one angle, Hesitation Marks represents band leader and only official member Trent Reznor’s attempt to balance white noise and black noise. Songs such as “In Two” and “Disappointed” spotlight similar build-ups of industrial dissonance. These droning wails excite listeners’ ears rather than hurting them, deluging them like tidal waves before disappearing into nothingness.
Hesitation Marks is the first Nine Inch Nails album since the band’s hiatus was announced in February of 2009. Reznor used his time off to start a new project called How To Destroy Angels with his wife, Mariqueen Maandig and British producer Atticus Ross. More famously, Reznor and Ross turned their talents to film scoring for David Fincher’s The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, taking home an Oscar and a Golden Globe for the first and a Grammy for the second. In a post on the band’s website in May of this year, however, Reznor announced the new album and remarked, “My forays into film, HTDA and other projects really stimulated me creatively and I decided to focus that energy on taking Nine Inch Nails to a new place. Here we go!”
And there they went. To guarantee the success of the new album, Reznor assembled an all-star cast of personnel to handle the direction of the new album. Atticus Ross returned as a producer, as did My Bloody Valentine and Yeah Yeah Yeahs producer Alan Moulder. Russell Mills, the album artist of NIN’s 1994 magnum opus The Downward Spiral returned to create all five alternate versions of the album’s cover. The most shocking of the new collaborators, however, is Lindsey Buckingham, guitarist and singer for ’70s pop band Fleetwood Mac. The new group of collaborators created a strong creative environment for Reznor.
Reznor strikes another balance on Hesitation Marks with the reconciliation of his familiar ’90s industrial sound with the sounds he and other artists explored over the past decade and a half. “I Would For You” plays the menacing synthesizers of Nine Inch Nails’ 1989 debut Pretty Hate Machine against a delicate piano that recalls 2010’s score to The Social Network. The reserved pomp of “Satellite” recalls 2000s era Muse. The album’s standout track and severest departure from the ’90s NIN sound, however, is “Everything,” sporting a Strokes-esque backbeat and a chorus resembling (believe it or not) the Backstreet Boys more than Marilyn Manson. Most importantly, Hesitation Marks brings the lo-fi buzzes and hums of ’90s Nine Inch Nails and cleans up the production to 21st-century standards.
Lyrically, the album resembles Reznor’s earlier output, minus the focus on addiction, madness and death that marked The Downward Spiral. In true Nine Inch Nails fashion, many of the lyrics smell of the same angst that everyone thought vanished when Linkin Park stopped being relevant. Lines such as, “If I could be somebody else / Well I think I would for you,” and, “I’m running out of places I can hide from this,” read like Reznor still writes lyrics in the same tattered composition book he got for his fourteenth birthday. The lyrics only seem overwrought, however, when he gets too long-winded. Reznor’s greatest lyrical strengths on the album are his short anthemic mantras, such as the quiet interlude of “Various Methods of Escape,” repeating, “I think I could lose myself in here,” or, “stretch across the sky,” from “All Time Low.” Many lyrics reflect personal struggles but are short on personal details, most notably the lead single, “Came Back Haunted,” which describes Reznor’s abandonment of and eventual return to Nine Inch Nails. Songs such as “Copy of A” describe more universal feelings of irrelevance in the face of a rapidly encroaching 21st century. In another shocking connection, penultimate track “While I’m Still Here” borrows the line, “God forgive me if I cry,” from country legend Hank Williams’ song, “Weary Blue from Waitin’.”
Among the pantheon of Nine Inch Nails albums, Hesitation Marks deserves a spot near the top. Not next to the tragic suicide saga that is The Downward Spiral or the frenetic synthesized nightmare of Pretty Hate Machine, but easily in the same realm. The album does have a few weaker cuts, but it has a few more amazing ones: “Everything,” “In Two,” “Find My Way” and “Various Methods of Escape.” Lyrically, Hesitation Marks is no masterpiece. But the album constructs a vastly expansive soundscape that is occasionally beautiful and occasionally terrifying.
You could lose yourself in here.

It’s nice, from time to time, to be reminded of the past, and, earlier this week, I had my opportunity to do so while watching a 1949 film for a class on post-war Hollywood. The Academy Award-winning film, A Letter to Three Wives, reflects upon the marriages of three women in light of news that their frenemy, Addie Ross, has run off with one of their husbands.
Though the film is meant to illuminate the American social tensions emerging and developing at the dawn of the ’50s, it’s hard to watch the movie without thinking about society as it exists today.
There’s a great scene, close to the beginning, that arguably says more about how we communicate today than how the characters interacted when the film actually takes place. The three women, all good friends, are prepared to embark upon a ship to do work with a group of Boy Scouts. A messenger then arrives bearing a letter from their dear friend, Addie. They discover that Addie has penned a message notifying them that she has left town with one of their husbands.
At this point, I half expected one of them to whip out their smartphones and launch a full-on barrage of calls to their respective spouses. It is, after all, the course I would have chosen. I will admit, albeit a tad pathetically, that I was equally shocked when they did not check his Facebook or scour his Twitter page. They didn’t even attempt to snoop around his email account.
No. They didn’t do any of these things. The three women simply turned around, boarded the ship and bon voyage they went.
Throughout their journey, each woman’s thoughts drifted to whether it was her husband with whom the much-sought-after Addie had eloped. It was an anxious, contemplative type of thinking, but certainly void of any active effort to contact their husbands — to reach out to them and find out, once and for all, whether they had fallen prey to Addie’s classy overtures.
The absence of this effort struck me as odd, to say the least. Again, these are three women who have just discovered that their marriages might be over. If your husband potentially just left you for another woman, I’m guessing your immediate reaction would fall far from nonchalantly dealing with the problem later. If it were my spouse at play, I would have immediately sprinted off the boat, iPhone in hand, to confirm the veracity of the claim.
And therein lies the difference between then and now. Communication technology then was far more static. One did not take for granted that they would be able to reach another person in a matter of minutes. Rather, correspondence required a measure of waiting on each end. It goes without saying that things have changed.
Communication can now surmount the harshest geographic barriers and that anachronistic term known as “availability” because, in all actuality, we are now expected to always be available. This is why I would find it completely logical that the women’s instinctual reaction should have been to dash down the ship’s ramp to check that their marriages were still, you know, existent.
Most of us were raised to always be reachable. (Guilty.) And many who weren’t raised this way have adjusted to the pressure (my mom). Interestingly, my mom used to tell me stories about how she would be stuck somewhere without a ride “and we didn’t have cellphones back then” so they were actually, honest to God, stuck. But she used to say this in a kind of “those were the days” manner.
And even she has folded under the pressure for constant communication. My mom is, in fact, always available, just as she expects my brother and me to be (something we can attest to quite well).
It would be too simple to say this trend was not a long time coming (airlines are kind enough to still remind us that two-way pagers existed before the cellphone). Still, the pressure to remain constantly connected to the grid has reached a high point in recent years.
And, for me, it’s given birth to a new fear: simply being disconnected from the grid. I worry that one day I’ll be riding the subway — yes, Los Angeles does in fact have one — and be stuck underground in a dangerous situation with no wireless signal or Internet connection. And, in this example, I find my fear to be entirely warranted and completely rational.
I’m not the only one, either. The London Underground, for example, is rolling out wireless access at its stations. Though the connection is probably often used for Snapchat and Vine, its existence provides a measure of public safety. If the technology is there, it seems only logical to take steps to alleviate this fear of disconnection.
But this fear is, in many cases, a double-edged sword. Though it might be undesirable in today’s society to be unreachable, there’s something important about stepping away from the world and thinking. Isolation allows for reflection and thought. Not having the ability to respond immediately provides an opportunity to analyze a situation and think critically.
In this sense, the fear of disconnection from the grid is entirely unwarranted and completely irrational. It shouldn’t be a fear at all. It should be welcome.
To translate it to A Letter to Three Wives, the women make no effort to contact their husbands and instead board the ship. But in doing so, they are afforded time to consider their marriages, remember how they began, where they erred and what they valued (or didn’t.) And, with the time afforded by not immediately reacting, their relationships, in most cases, end stronger rather than weaker.

It’s no secret that the USC alumni network has a global footprint. Leo Temory, a 2008 graduate of USC who studied business administration at the Marshall School of Business, seems to have taken that statement literally, though.

Temory and his cousin Jamal Zadran will be contestants in the 23rd season of The Amazing Race, set to premiere later this month. Temory, who owns a restaurant and bar in Pasadena, is a first generation college graduate who has been a fan of the show since it started. He never thought that he would actually be on it.  Everything came together in just the right way, however, and he and his cousin have been able to live out their dream of being on the show.
The duo, who jokingly call themselves the “Afghanimals” because their parents immigrated to the U.S. from Afghanistan, hope to bring diversity and humor to the show.
The Daily Trojan caught up with Temory to talk to him about what he learned at USC and how he’s applied that in his life, from building a business to being a contestant on The Amazing Race:
 
DT: What made you decide to go on The Amazing Race?
Temory: My cousin and I were fans from season one, but we were too young at the time. Then he was off doing his own thing, and I was off doing my own thing. And then, finally, the stars aligned. The process is actually not as easy as it looks, but I got a call and the next thing you know, we’re on The Amazing Race and traveling [around] the world. It was probably the funnest, most memorable time of my life — after USC, of course.
DT: This is your first reality TV show. Did you have any expectations before you started shooting?
Temory: Going in, watching 22 seasons of The Amazing Race on DVD, you think it’s easy, but the production that goes into it, the amount of crew, the amount of staff that goes on to make such a show, it’s like an orchestra and it’s always perfectly orchestrated and it’s just remarkable. It’s like if you put the million dollars aside it’s like it’s priceless, the experience you get.
DT: What was life like as a contestant on reality TV?
Temory: Well, I always love attention. With my group of friends, I like to crack jokes, go up to people, so in that regard I loved having a camera around you 24 hours a day practically recording everything you do, but definitely still to this day it feels surreal, like I can’t believe I was on The Amazing Race. I just watched a commercial the other day, and I’m like, “Wow I can’t believe that’s me.” I’m just thankful I get to relive it again when it airs.
DT: What do you hope audience members take out of your experience on the show?
Temory: I think I really brought the Trojan family mentality out in the race. You could see the humor that we bring, the smarts, the strength that we bring, basically the whole all-around perspective that encompasses the USC culture. I tried my best to bring it to the show with my cousin. Hopefully, everyone sees we’re fun-loving, crazy fans that want to have a good time.
DT: Did you learn anything at USC which you were able to apply to the show?
Temory: If USC taught me one thing, it was to network. I tell that to everybody, everyday, “Network, network!” and that went along with The Amazing Race. It’s networking in a different perspective, communicating with different cultures, learning from different cultures, interacting, taking it all in … It’s not all about the million dollars, but the experience — it’s the experience of a lifetime.
DT: What do you think you and your cousin bring that gives you an advantage stand apart?
Temory: Definitely what we bring is culture. We bring a little diversity. We can actually connect with all the other cultures around the world, all the different people, different ethnicities from kids to adults. Our parents immigrated here, so they have that aspect. We have that within us because we’re Afghan Americans so I think it’ll be easier for us to connect if we visit a third world country or if we visit another country, you know, we’re immigrants, they’re immigrants so we can all sort of relate. We’ll bring the fun, diversity, excitement … a ton of things we bring we’re proud of. But you’ll just have to watch and see.

He was known as “the great compromiser.” Henry Clay was the Kentucky statesman most famous for his role in brokering the 1821 Missouri Compromise and mediating the 1833 Nullification Crisis. Given the recent history of Congressional inaction, Clay has probably rolled over in his grave enough times to sink it a few feet further into the ground at Lexington Cemetery.
If there were a week for Clay to witness, it would be this one. Clay manufactured compromise at a time when the fate of the Union was on the line. In the wake of U.S. and French intelligence revelations that the Syrian regime deployed chemical weapons against a rebel force outside of Damascus, the question of limited military intervention on the part of the United States and others in the international community has been thrust into the spotlight.
When President Barack Obama was asked earlier in the week at a press conference about his “red line” against the use of chemical weapons, he said that line was made clear by a chemical weapons treaty ratified by nearly the entire world.
Instead of taking unilateral action reminiscent of the 1999 Kosovo campaign, when Clinton supported NATO airstrikes against the Serbs despite not receiving a clear mandate from Congress to do so, Obama is asking for Congressional compromise when he doesn’t need it — and it could be a revolutionary turnaround for a presidency tarnished by political stalemate.
Following Obama’s request, CNN reports that he received support from members of the GOP including Speaker John Boehner, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor and Sen. Lindsey Graham. Sen. Rand Paul, who just months ago spoke out against Obama’s drone policy in a nearly nine hour-long filibuster, was supportive of  Obama’s request for Congressional authorization, but said he would not support legislation authorizing the use of airstrikes. This time, however, Paul will face pressure from both sides of the aisle to support a compromise on intervention.
This time, a President weary of long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan might be finally learning the lessons of history, and in more ways than one. If Iraq is any indication, a divided house cannot wage wars successfully — and beginning with Congressional authorization seems to recognize that. Though Congress handed President George W. Bush a blank check for action in the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force (which only Rep. Barbara Lee of California was brave enough to vote against), Obama’s request this time around is distinct because the outcome of congressional action will not be a simple yes or no. Instead, the outcome of deliberation will be a consensus on the best course of action — something that was distinctly missing when Congress handed the reigns over to Bush to careen into the Middle East.
The measure, which is continually being reworded by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, represents a process of consensus that demonstrates the power of productive disagreement.
Politico reported that the resolution (as drafted on Wednesday) sets a 60-day deadline for the use of force with the possibility of a 30-day extension. Reuters reports that the resolution “would ban any use of U.S. armed forces on the ground in Syria.” This is especially significant, given Secretary of State John Kerry’s push to keep the option of combat troop involvement on the table. If the restriction on combat troops makes it into the final bill signed by Obama, and Obama follows through on such a restriction, it will be an important example of the power of the deliberative process, and one that is often absent from Congress.
Congress has effectively steamrolled Obama’s foreign policy in the past — the funding restrictions and bans on detainee transfers instituted after Obama’s executive order to close Guantanamo are proof that Congress is not a paper tiger. Even in Kosovo, Congress voted in 1999 to successfully prohibit Department of Defense funds from being used to support a ground troop campaign.
More importantly, no matter what Obama decides to do in response, Congress is about to engage in an intense sequence of debates unmotivated by party lines or hidden agendas. We can’t fall back to divisions along party lines.
 
Nathaniel Haas is  a sophomore majoring in political science and economics. His column “A House Divided” runs on Thursdays.
The strongest point of debate over whether to go to war is the fact that our treasury is empty. Obama’s budgets are nearly double the tax intake. Who will lend the money to pay for the missiles, soldiers, planes, ships, bullets and medical supplies? What is the rate of return? Will there be a net economic benefit? To Whom? 
If we spend $50 million raining hell on a Syria, how many new jobs will that create and how many new friends will we have? What if we spend $1 billion? $10 billion? $100 Billion?

Brandy Melville has earned quite the reputation as a trendy Italian brand with California flair. Though some of their clothes appear clever and cute — after all, who doesn’t want to own a shirt with the classic Mean Girls quote “You Can’t Sit With Us”? — Brandy Melville’s company practices are toxic to our culture.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
On any day at Third Street Promenade, it’s quite easy to spot swarms of giggling girls, clutching their handbags and smacking their gum, browsing the Brandy Melville store. Sure, there’s nothing wrong with that picture — sounds like any other scene while shopping. But a quick glance around Brandy Melville and something different will stand out: The black and white signs dispersed throughout that read in all-caps, “one size fits most.”
Now here’s a problem. One size does not fit most. According to the Los Angeles Times, the average American woman is a size 14. The crop-tops and miniskirts that litter the shelves of Brandy Melville would barely cover the average American.
So, factually, the label is wrong. Secondly, this type of a store environment — one that emphasizes girls of other sizes are not welcome — is extremely damaging to female self-esteem. Brandy Melville embarrasses girls of different sizes by insinuating that “most” women are petite, when in fact, they are not. According to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, in a survey of 185 female students on a college campus, 58 percent felt pressure to be a certain weight. Furthermore, companies such as Brandy Melville fuel eating disorders by propagating an ideal body shape. According to the National Eating Disorders Association, young people go to great lengths to meet these unreasonable societal expectations: More than 50 percent of teenage girls use unhealthy weight control behaviors such as skipping meals, fasting, smoking cigarettes, vomiting and taking laxatives.
Brandy Melville boasts on its website, “Women of every age can find something at Brandy Melville to fit their style, closet and budget.” Women of every age? Why not women of every size? It’s difficult to imagine a 70-year-old woman donning a “B-tch I’m in the 212” shirt — Brandy Melville’s priorities are clearly askew.
In order to ameliorate their current misconduct, they should act immediately. If Brandy Melville does not plan to add additional sizes any time soon, they must remove these signs from their stores and the tags of their products.
Ultimately, if they wish to stick to such a narrow — pun very much intended — target audience, their profit margins will inevitably suffer. But consumers have the power to stop such companies from perpetuating negative body image, no matter their size or shape. Asking them to remove these signs is the first step in battling such distasteful choices.
When girls already wallow in a world of self-loathing, we don’t need stores like Brandy Melville reinforcing ideas of a cookie-cutter shape.
Yet according to the Times, Brandy Melville is not alone.
The Times reported that “Fashion-forward boutiques such as Maxfield and Fred Segal rarely stock anything over a size 10, and in designer shops, sizes beyond 6 or 8 are often hidden like contraband in the back.”
Staying conscious of these unacceptable practices allows us to have control over the world around us. Stephen F. Quinn, senior vice president for marketing at Wal-Mart, stated at a company convention, “Today, the customer is in charge. And whoever is best at putting the customer in charge makes all the money.”
Most recently, companies such as Forever 21 and H&M took pressure from consumers seriously and expanded their fashion line for those over a size 12.
Evidently, entrepreneurs recognize the power of the public. It’s time to harness that power in order to spur change.
So ladies, if you find it hard to squeeze into one of their low-quality cotton shirts, don’t think any less of yourself. Take your money and time elsewhere. Until Brandy Melville realizes that they’re wrong, we must realize that there are way more appropriate and fashionable options.
So listen up, Brandy Melville. You definitely can’t sit with us.

oh and for that 12 year old girl that was sad  PUT DOWN THE HAPPY MEAL why are you a target of OBESITY
first of all , brandy melville is Amazing . Honestly if you cant fit in the clothes shop somewhere else , but bash on the store why ? The origin of the brand is Europe . Maybe if you put the mcdonalds happy meal down and ran a little you would be able to wear the brand. why do you have to be jealous that you cant fit into the clothing
As a teenage girl who wears a size 16 in jeans and a Large or X-Large in shirts going onto their website is so depressing. Yeah okay, it’s they’re store, whatever, it doesn’t mean that it’s right to tell me that if I can’t fit a size Small then I can’t shop there. And to be completely honest it’s just stupid, they could make a lot more money if they sold larger sizes but I don’t know maybe they don’t like people who are average or large. Bottom line a store shouldn’t make you hate yourself because you can’t fit into most of their clothes. And btw Jess, Danielle and Arianna you obviously don’t know what it’s like to go into store after store and come out with nothing because the store doesn’t stock your size and then you spend the rest of the year in sweatpants because all the clothes that fit you are ugly.
Do you think Lane Bryant is also stupid for only catering to a certain subset of the population?
You can’t compare Lane Bryant and Brandy- one is made for a non-normative body type (as per societal ideas) and the other ~is~ the norm (as the store itself preaches: one size fits most) when in reality one size doesn’t fit most. Not only is Brandy Melville catering to a certain attitude and subculture but that entire attitude and store ambiance is defining itself as the ingroup rather than the outgroup. It’s hard to believe that one size fits most when you walk into the store and hold up a pair of shredded high waisted shorts that look like they were cut to fit a prepubescent gymnast (no wonder the eating disorder correlation). And even sadder is the amount of female defense of Brandy on here. Shame.
Ultimately, women have to either admit they are very easily duped by marketers and easy prey for others to set their own image for them or that they will be strong, independent thinking individuals and not cave in to stupid marketing ploys.
No one has a “right” to NOT feel bad because they feel they are being excluded from a clique. These manufacturers are trying to make their customers feel like they are part of an exclusive “cool table in the lunchroom” and the author of the article is crying to mommy to make the cool kids sit with them.
How many male images of ripped, six packs abs do we see everyday and how many men in reality have a flabby waistline? Should men group together and boycott all superhero movies because we are not as lean and muscular as the image in the billboard? 
I agree eating disorders are a problem but I do not understand why we are so quick to play the blame game instead of raising young women to shrug off this brand-crazed worship. 
The author also seems to represent a growing population of self-important, sanctimonious people who are driven to destroy and eliminate anything they do not approve. Who are you to say what kinds of signs and tags another company has the right to display? Who made you the ruler of all things public? How is it some girls are aware of this brand and even if they do not fit into their clothes, they do not have an eating disorder? Could it be it is possible for girls to have enough confidence and intelligence to not place so much stock on stupid label gimmicks?
BTW, would the author also berate Lane Bryant for making clothes only for another subset of the population? The author I am sure deplores Lane Bryant’s exclusionary tactics of only catering to plus size women. Or does the author practice her own form of hypocrisy and only have vitriol towards skinny girls?
This was beautifully written. I totally agree and am glad I wasn’t the only one who felt that way since the only store that existed was in santa monica. I recentley went into Brandy with my friend and saw a curvy girl of age 12 distraught and hysterical. As her mother tried to calm her down, it turned out that she was crying because she didn’t fit into any of the clothes. The terrible feeling permeated the store for a bit. Yeah- no body told her to shop there but as a consumer and human being she had the free will to go inside. Clearly Brandy has taken Los Angeles by storm; whenever I go out, I noted that all teenaged girls who wear brandy are thin thighed and long haired girls who want to resemble the brandy girl image on instagram. It’s just sad that some people are not educated enough to see the overarching message and  greater picture of image discrimination. Hope people love themself enough to shop at a store where they feel and look as great in their own size and figure type at any age.
Agree 100%.
It’s ridiculous how much I hate I see towards girls that DO fit into Brandy Melville’s clothes. There are plenty of other stores in this world so if you don’t like the “one size fits most” then take your money elsewhere because I can assure you that it’s not gonna make a difference. If a girl feels like she has to lose weight to fit in A stores clothes then she has some issues of her own that she needs to work out, don’t go point a finger and make someone else the bad guy. The store is not the pathetic one in this situation.
The store is clearly marketed towards women 25 or younger. The label “one size fits most” is directed towards their customers, not aimed to tell women everywhere what size they should be.
Next, this company has locations in cities that fall far below the national average of obesity. This means your fact that the “average American women is a size 14” is irrelevant due to sample size and target market.
Saying that brandy Melville shouldn’t market a body type is like saying Sport Chalet shouldn’t sell running shoes because a large percentage of Americans can’t run a mile.
It has come to the point where we, as a society, should stop accommodating overweight people, and start addressing the cause. Making clothes in bigger sizes won’t help overweight people feel any better about themselves nor will it make them any healthier.
Lastly, mean girls was a fantastic movie. How dare you make a Gretchen Wieners quote a social issue.
Okay i shop at brandy melville. I don’t understand why everyone has to bash this store. The founder decided to make the clothes one size fits most. That’s their company & they can do whatever they want to. Just because you might not fit into the clothes doesn’t mean you have to hate on this store. No one asked you to shop here, & if the label one size fits most offends you, then go shop somewhere else.
