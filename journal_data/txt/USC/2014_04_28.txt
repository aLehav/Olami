On Monday evening, USC Hillel hosted “Remembering the Holocaust: A Yom Ha’Shoah Ceremony” as part of USC’s Genocide Awareness Month.

The event, which began with a short religious ceremony in memory of the 6 million Jewish Holocaust victims, included the lighting of six candles — one for each million killed.
Following this was a panel on the Holocaust led by Dan Leshem, the USC Shoah Foundation associate director of research.
Yom Ha’Shoah, or Holocaust Remembrance Day, began Sunday evening and ended Monday evening. The day was established in 1953 to commemorate the approximately 6 million Jews who died during the Holocaust as a result of the actions of Nazi Germany.
Monday’s panelists included child Holocaust survivor Henri Slucki, executive director of the Los Angeles Holocaust Museum Samara Hutman and American Jewish University Professor Michael Berenbaum.
Slucki, who was living in Paris when the Nazis invaded, said each Holocaust testimonial is unique in its own special way.
“No two survivors have identical stories,” Slucki said.
He then went on to explain his story. Though born in Paris, Slucki moved to southern France when his father was discharged from the French army. On Aug. 26, 1942, the French government rounded up the Jews, and at 6 a.m., he heard a terrible knock at his family’s door. Slucki and his family, however, did not answer.
“Had that door opened, I would have been taken away,” he said.
After the incident, he and his family escaped to Spain, where he would eventually be sent to the United States without his parents as part of the U.S. transport system, Kindertransport, which rescued Jewish children.
Berenbaum, who has served as former deputy director of the President’s Commission on the Holocaust, project director for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and president and CEO of the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Museum, spoke of the importance of the Holocaust and commemorating those who were killed.
“Of all the ancient people who had been defeated, the only people with real continuity, who can trace their ancestry for a long period of time, are these crazy people called the Jews,” Berenbaum said.
While he was completing his doctorate in Holocaust studies, there were only two institutions in the United States that offered such a degree. Moreover, when he started teaching about the Holocaust, the number of professors working in Holocaust studies could fit into one phone booth, Berenbaum said.
“Coming to grips with Jewish history is to touch levels of depth, passion, eternity and struggles,” he said. “The Holocaust is unique in that most people deal with life or death once or twice in their life. People in the Holocaust lived with the ultimate threat of life or death not once or twice, but as part of a daily routine.”
Working in the early days of the Shoah Foundation, Berenbaum’s task was to spread the voices of those impacted by the Holocaust. He said that studying and remembering the Holocaust is ultimately a part of his destiny.
“Fate is very often something that happens,” Berenbaum said. “Destiny is that moment when you realize that what happens to you is the purpose for which you were intended. If you’re lucky then you find that your fate equals, comes to terms with or meets your destiny. My task in life was to give a voice to that which could not be told to me [when I was younger],” Berenbaum said.
Essentially, Berenbaum believes filming Holocaust survivors gives a sense of permanence to their stories.
“[The videos] give them an immortality because their words will live beyond their human existence,” he said.
A topic brought up during the panel was the sense of urgency, as the current generation will be the last to be able to personally communicate with Holocaust survivors.
Sam Fein, student president of USC Hillel, stressed the importance of talking to Holocaust survivors.
“We are 70 years out from the Holocaust now,” Fein said. “There are not that many survivors left, so it is a privilege and honor to hear their stories.”
Slucki also recognized the urgency of teaching about the Holocaust and telling his unique story.
“The time is running out,” Slucki said. “We are a group of individuals that are dwindling down. If none of us were to let our stories be known, then those events will be buried with us. After a person dies, there are no more questions you can ask or get answered, This is the time to ask the questions.”

The USC chapter of the Swipes for the Homeless charitable organization is collaborating with the incoming Undergraduate Student Government president to display its name on the USC meal plan web page by the next academic school year.

With this development, the incoming freshman class, as well as any other student who signs up for a meal plan, would have the option of donating any of his or her remaining balance on their dining dollars to USC Swipes for the Homeless at the beginning of the year.
The chapter works hand-in-hand with USC Hospitality, which converts each student’s account into food for those who pledged to donate. The food then gets donated to the Los Angeles Mission. Last semester, the chapter raised over $20,000 in donations, courtesy of about 215 USC students who pledged to donate to the cause.
It has been two years since the organization debuted on campus, and since then, it has been busy establishing itself within USC culture.
“I think [Swipes for the Homeless] is a great program, and I am excited that this is gaining traction because I remember a couple years ago it was getting off its feet,” said Madi Swayne, a junior majoring in environmental studies. “I’d really like this to be incorporated in the meal plans and be an option that you choose in the beginning instead at the end.”
The President of the USC Swipes for the Homeless Lauren O’Neil was honored last December by the Jenzabar Foundation in Cincinnati, Ohio, where she accepted a $5,000 grant and a student leadership award.
Kate Kulaga, the external director of marketing for the USC chapter, has also played an integral role within the organization and noted that giving back is one of her favorite pastimes.
“Helping people, it’s just one of those things that makes me smile…it gets me through,” she said. “I love volunteering. I have confidence that when we do something it will turn out well. I like to help people and know what we do will be effective.”
The chapter has also paired with HungerGrad, a phone application that informs users of different restaurants nearby with deals and discounts. President O’Neil said that for this week, HungerGrad will donate 25 cents to USC Swipes For The Homeless for every order.
Many students around campus believe that USC Swipes for the Homeless is beneficial for the USC community and support and encourage participation from their peers.
“It is another way for USC to further integrate itself with the surrounding community,” Swayne said. “I know that students that go to the school really like to give back, and this is a way for them to give back in a meaningful way.”
Amelia Moura, a junior majoring in environmental studies, said this program allows students to give back to the surrounding community in an easy way.
“The school has already received money for the food it’s supposed to serve and if the students don’t use that all up, I think that leftover food supply should be donated to those who can’t afford their own meals,” Moura said. “Students can give back to the community without having to go anywhere.”
Lucile Condolora, a sophomore majoring in theatre, said that members of the USC community are especially fortunate and should try to give back when possible.
“I think it is absolutely wonderful,” Condolora said. “We are so blessed already as a community and as Trojans. It would be simply irresponsible to not support Swipes knowing that your money could go towards greater good.”
In the future, O’Neil hopes to create more volunteer-focused activities, such as trips to Skid Row or volunteering at the missions.
“Both of us are involved in so many diverse organizations that probably have nothing to do with our intended majors, but we do it because of that feeling you get when no matter what is going on in your day, you are still making a difference,” O’Neil said. “Even if you are reaching out and helping one person, that is one person you are supporting.”
The last day to donate dining dollars is May 2 at 5p.m.

ABC’s hit TV show Shark Tank, a reality series in which up-and-coming entrepreneurs pitch their products and ideas to a panel of investors, hosted an open call yesterday afternoon in Mudd Hall of Philosophy.
Pitches · Xiao Liang, a sophomore majoring in accounting (left) and Yingxin Chen, a junior majoring in business administration, pitch their ideas to Mindy Zemrak (right), the casting manager of Shark Tank. – Alison Brett | Daily Trojan
The reality show’s casting team heard more than 25 pitches from USC students, alumni, faculty and staff in conjunction with the Health, Technology and Engineering program.
HTE@USC is an interdisciplinary program for graduate students co-sponsored by the Keck School of Medicine and Viterbi School of Engineering that focuses on bridging the gap between medicine and technological innovation.
Nadine Afari, project specialist for HTE@USC, and Mindy Zemrak, casting manager for Shark Tank, both proposed the open house. Zemrak is an alumna of the School of Cinematic Arts, and the two were able to connect via Twitter when Zemrak was looking for a way to come to campus and host an open house.
“I knew USC would be a perfect fit on stops for open calls [for Shark Tank] at universities,” Zemrak said. “Its entrepreneurial student body and top-notch academic reputation stood out the most.”
Shark Tank premiered in 2009 and earned an Emmy Award nomination in 2012 and 2013 for Most Outstanding Reality Program. The show is centered on hopeful entrepreneurs who pitch their ideas to potential investors, such as Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, successful real estate entrepreneur Barbara Corcoran and clothing line founder Daymond John, in the hopes of landing one or more of the “sharks” as investors and partners in their business.
Last season drew over 40,000 applications to be on the show. Even those who walk away with no deal still gain exposure to nearly 7 million viewers during their pitch.
Shark Tank typically does general open casting calls, but this season chose to focus part of its efforts on college campuses. The idea of coming to colleges to search for talent was something that will be present much more in the upcoming season.
“We have been to Harvard, UT Austin, UNLV, Ohio State, San Diego State University and University of Colorado at Boulder,” Zemrak said. “There is a possibility that this season will have a college-focused episode entirely devoted to student-based entrepreneurs.”
HTE@USC Administrative Director George Tolomiczenko discussed how the casting call facilitated successful collaboration between USC schools.
“Today we were able to allow all of our campus the opportunity at being on [Shark Tank] — it really is great,” Tolomiczenko said. “I’ve already seen a team in here today that had students from Viterbi, Keck and Marshall — a collaboration across USC which is exactly what we are aiming for.”
Those who attended were allotted roughly one to two minutes to pitch their ideas to the casting team, similar to an ordinary open call.
A follow-up will happen in the coming weeks, and then those selected must put together a five to 10-minute video where they demo the product or service they pitched, which is then seen by producers before the contestant pool is cut down once again.
Zemrak described how rewarding it has been to work on the show since the first season; she currently serves as the casting director for the show.
“We are definitely the little show that keeps growing and growing,” she said. “I’ve seen people’s lives changed just from being on the show, which makes my job that much more satisfying.”
She noted that studying at USC was instrumental in getting her to where she is today.
“My time at USC greatly prepared me for what I’ve been doing in my career thus far and provided me with the tools I needed to be successful in television,” Zemrak said.
Those who missed out on the open call yesterday at Mudd Hall are still able to apply for the show via the website, ABC.com. There is also an open call being hosted in San Diego, Calif. at Coleman University the first weekend of June. More details can also be found on the Shark Tank website.

One might call the cast and crew of Songs for a New World USC’s version of the Ringling Bros., a traveling troupe of diverse acrobats and entertainers known for their collaborations and immortalized in film as The Greatest Show on Earth. Like the greatest show, the actors, musicians and producers of the USC Musical Theatre Repertory are collaborating for a final time this year for their spring musical. The first show is Wednesday at 10:30 p.m., followed by two more performances on Thursday at 11 p.m. and Friday at 9:30 p.m.
The play, with music and lyrics written by Jason Robert Brown, debuts at the Massman Theatre and promises to be a fun and unconventional departure from the traditional musical, which usually intermixes stage-based dialogue with musical performances.
Instead, Songs for a New World will treat viewers to a very different experience. The performance, in the style of a “song cycle,” will tell more than just one story; each of the play’s five leads will act out a series of vignette-style scenes centered around a different song (but with a common theme). Their characters don’t have names because they play a different character each scene, and true to the style of a song cycle, the characters sing every line in the play.
Myles Nuzzi, one of the five leads, said each scene weaves together stories of critical decisions regarding love, regret and loss.
“The main theme of the entire musical is the idea of the moment before you have to make a decision,” said Nuzzi, a sophomore majoring in music industry. “There’s a moment in your life when you reach that impulse decision — that’s what all the songs are about.”
Nuzzi especially likes the scenes that begin and end the play.
“The very opening and the very closing numbers, [are his favorite] because they are the two songs where all of us are on stage together,” he said. “Both songs are very similar, and they both encompass the entire musical — the first song is about what is to come, and the end song is a conclusion, so it’s really cool to see the whole arc of the show in those two songs.”
Vicki Pearlman, a sophomore majoring in theatre who is directing the play, has produced several shows for the Musical Theatre Repertory and has worked with some of the play’s actors in previous productions.
One of those actors is Nuzzi, who acted in MTR’s production of Merrily We Roll Along, a show Pearlman produced. Nuzzi said Pearlman’s experience with every aspect of play production made her transition to a directorial role seamless.
“Because she has done so much behind-the-scenes work in the past, she knows every facet of how rehearsals should be run, how the production team should focus, and how involved they should be,” he said. “Her strength is as a leader combining the strengths and duties of all the other people on her team.”
Pearlman said that she has enjoyed the challenge of directing, especially on such a unique project.
“To be doing a show that has no dialogue, just song, has been difficult,” said Pearlman, the president of the Musical Theatre Repertory. “The best part of MTR is you are collaborating so much with the choreography director and the music director — my favorite part about it is it’s a collective vision of multiple people.”
One of the people sharing that collective vision is Nathan Heldman, one of the musical directors. Heldman is responsible for coaching the actors on singing and performing the music, as well as playing the music live during the performance with a few other musicians. Pearlman, who worked with his when she produced Merrily We Roll Along, said Heldman’s work with the actors is exemplary. Nuzzi went to “GRAMMY Camp,” a musical program for young singers, with Heldman in high school.”
“He is always giving insight into the music and what certain things imply in the story,” Nuzzi said. “What’s great about him is that while he is a piano major, he has knowledge in vocal performance so he knows exactly what to say to get people to produce the sound that he wants to hear and that the audiences want to hear.”
Unilke Nuzzi, Heldman doesn’t have a favorite scene.
“That’s impossible,” Heldman said. “My favorite number switches every day because the singers bring a new thing to a number every single day.”
You can tell from listening to the cast talk about each other that they have prepared for the play not just as actors, producers and directors, but as friends. Bella Hicks, an actress in the play who has worked with Nuzzi before and a freshman majoring in theatre, put it best:
“They call it ‘the MTR family,’ because once you’re in a show with them, they become a family.”

In my first column this semester, I wrote about the frustration I felt hearing the “Beat L.A.” chant at a Kings game. If there’s anything I want people to get out of this column, it’s that they should give this city a real chance. Especially for new transplants, Los Angeles can feel overwhelming at first. But before resorting to common refrains such as “there’s no public transportation,” and “it doesn’t even feel like a city,” make a point to walk around outside of USC’s campus, and really get a taste for the Angeleno lifestyle.
Every Tuesday after this column has run, I’ve consistently gotten feedback from friends and strangers on topic suggestions for later weeks: on other places and events I hadn’t touched on yet. Some of the ideas I’d heard of, many I didn’t even realize were available here.
Four years is a short time to get to know a place. Because I transferred to USC, I only had three living near campus. Looking back, there was so much time I could have spent of my undergraduate career experiencing Los Angeles. On my computer, I have a list of column ideas that I never had a chance to write, and that just makes me realize how there will always be more here to experience, more to say, more to remember. But it also makes me realize how easy it is to find things, both familiar and foreign, to try here. In a way, it’s a shame that it took a column to spur me to go out each week and experience a different piece of Los Angeles.
Last week, I thought for a while about what I wanted to do for my last column. It will be my last piece for the Daily Trojan, a paper that I’ve been privileged to be a part of during my time at USC. Originally, I had thought I would go on one of those movie star tour buses that you always see in Hollywood. Then I thought I’d spend it at the Santa Monica Pier. Instead, I spent the weekend two hours away from Los Angeles, having a wonderful time camping in Indio, Calif., and reporting on Stagecoach, California’s largest country music festival. When I think of country music and California, I normally think Fresno or Orange County, but the surprise of the weekend was just how many people there were from Los Angeles — another detail to file away about this city for another time.
The drive is what I want to discuss now, though. One thing I haven’t had a chance to talk about in this column is how easy it is to take a getaway from this city. It’s easy to feel stuck in the bubble of Los Angeles sometimes, but it’s crazy just how simple it is to drive a little bit and find yourself in a completely different environment. If you find yourself missing the starry night sky living in the middle of Downtown, all it takes is plugging directions into Google maps to take you somewhere where the stars litter the whole sky.
As weird as that might sound, the ability to leave is one of the really appealing features about living here. Car culture, love it or hate it, runs Los Angeles. The great thing about it, though, is the mobility it offers. If you can find yourself a car and a few hours to spare, you can literally find yourself in any geographic climate: the sand, the snow or the surf.
And there’s something beautiful about the drive itself. Especially when you’re coming back into the city. Not to pull another reference from the popular Saturday Night Live skit, “The Californians,” but I took the 10 West all the way back last night. It’s amazing how far away you can see the lights from Los Angeles in the distance. And you know that the Pacific Ocean is waiting beyond, if you keep on driving.
In the daytime, the freeway is stacked with cars, so it’s harder to get a sense of the possibilities on the road, but at night, you really get a chance to see just how many roads lead to and from this city. There are so many roads to take and so many options of where to go next.
And when you drive back, it always feels like the city has changed a little since you left it last. Back in January, GQ did a feature on Los Angeles, with the headline “America’s Next Great City Is Inside L.A.,” shining a light on the burgeoning downtown scene. This city keeps growing — expect more headlines like that to keep coming, because there is something about it here that attracts people, and growth. There’s a reason it was represented as the city of the future in Spike Jonze’s Her.
I’m going to be living in a new city next year, and it’s going to be hard to be away from Los Angeles. But I can’t tell you how excited I am to see how the city has changed when I come back. Because the roads all eventually lead here. And I know when I do get back, there will be plenty more stories about Los Angeles to tell.

“Red, White and Luke Bryan’s Butt,” read a bold tank top of a 20-something-year-old festivalgoer at Stagecoach, the three-day country music festival in Indio, Calif. Though the woman, who paired the shirt with cut-off shorts and cowboy boots with a bandana wrapped around the heel, might have just been expressing her appreciation for Bryan, the closing artist for the final night of the festival, the shirt seemed to set the mood for the eighth annual event put on by Goldenvoice.
Yes, many fans were there to appreciate the, ahem, assets of the stacked artist lineup. But more than that, it seemed the phrase represented the newer demographic of country music fans that predominated the sold-out Stagecoach crowd this year — still interested in the mainstays of the genre (God, country and beer), but also younger in age, and seemingly more open to the cross-pollination of the genre that has widened the fanbase beyond the quote-unquote flyover states.
“[Country music’s] been everywhere,” said Brigit Cooper, who traveled from San Diego to attend the festival. “It’s more pop and mainstream now then it was in the Hank Williams age. The songwriters are coming up, people are relating to their music, their writing … and the variety, it’s always changing, there’s always new stuff.”
Indeed, more than anything, this year’s Stagecoach was notable for the diversity of its artists, if not necessarily its audience. While headliners such as Eric Church, Jason Aldean and Luke Bryan dominated the Mane stage at night, the Palomino and Mustang stages featured a mix of up-and-comers, and traditional country music icons.
Emily Lopez, who traveled from Fresno with a friend to Stagecoach, said she felt this year showcased the fast rise of new artists in country music.
“A lot of artists got big really fast.” she said. “They just came on the scene really quickly, like Florida Georgia Line [on Sunday]. No one knew who they were and then they just blew up.”
Laurie Johnson, who lives in Orange County, said she noticed the rise in female singer-songwriters at Stagecoach this year. From Holly Williams, the granddaughter of Country music legend Hank Williams, who sang hits off of her latest album On the Highway, to The Voice’s Danielle Bradbery, who mixed it up by performing a Katy Perry song during her set, there was a strong representation of female artists.
“Females have really come [out] on top,” Johnson said. “In my time frame, it was really all guys, it was basically all men: George Strait, Willie Nelson, and now, you know, you have [artists like] Crystal Gayle who played [on Saturday]. Oh my gosh … I didn’t think anything was going to be able to top the Country Music Awards that I went to in Vegas, but this tops it by mountains.”
For Lopez, some of the major names stood out the most to her during the festival.
“Hunter Hayes was so good; Eric Church was great,” she said, adding that both musicians sing about a lot of topics that she can empathize with.
“I like how country music is so real,” Lopez said. “It touches all kinds of lives, it’s relatable.”
Relatability might be the key word to understanding the appeal of country music among newer fans. Stagecoach, after all, is not in Nashville, Tenn., and there was a clear SoCal flair apparent among attendees: Brandy Melville festival dresses and stylish boots were popular among girls; Los Angeles Kings caps and cowboy hats (some made out of $35 beer boxes sold at the festival) with open T-shirts and jeans seemed to be the outfit of choice for guys.
Artists and fans alike seemed to embrace the buzzwords of the country genre all weekend, talking about back roads, double-wide trailers and fishing. Though it is doubtful that many of the people in the audience ever personally experienced those scenes, it didn’t matter. They were still able to find their own truths embedded in the songs.
As Johnson said, it’s storytelling. Previously a heavy metal fan, Johnson said she jumped genres when she first really sat down and listened to country music.
“I walked into a country bar and that was it, I was done,” she said. “I think it was because you could hear the music, you could hear the lyrics, it touched every part of your body.”
Many fans had similar sentiments. Taylor Brown, who drove from Huntington Beach, Calif. to attend the festival, said she thought she hated country music until five years ago.
“I lived with a bunch of girls that just loved country music and it grows on you,” Brown said. “It’s just — you have to have a soul, that’s what we all joke around about. You have to have a soul.”
So that might be why, despite technical difficulties on Friday night, Church won the crowd over with his latest hit, “Give Me Back My Hometown.” The lyrics, which could be about Anytown, USA (“These sleepy streetlights on every sidewalk side street / Shed a light on everything that used to be”), might not have been penned with California in mind, but there was something to latch onto in the words, and the audience sang along late into the night.
And when Bryan took the stage Sunday and delivered an intimate performance of “Drink a Beer,” the crowd sang it back to him even louder.
Around them, the palm trees were lit red, white and blue. Fans new and old raised their glasses into the desert night and sang the words back: “So long my friend / Until we meet again / I’ll remember you / And all the times that we used to sit right here on the edge of this pier / And watch the sunset disappear.”
Then, rather than get into their cars to get a jump on the traffic, most people stayed right where they were until the end of his set. They were with it to the end, from songs off his latest album, Crash My Party, to his take on hits by Jason Derulo and Macklemore, singing along with the country, the pop and the rap — happy to dance and, to quote Bryan, “drink a beer.”

It wasn’t supposed to end like this.
Four years ago, as I waited anxiously for my college decision letters to arrive, I envisioned how it would all play out — my dream school would accept me, the school whose posters and jerseys covered the walls of my bedroom, and I’d get to go to college close to my Orange County home. I’d worked hard, made the grades and done everything I could to make the dream a reality.
But then the small envelope came, and my fate was sealed — I didn’t get into UCLA.
It’s a harsh truth to come to terms with, getting rejected. Part of me knew that my chances of getting into the school whose football and basketball teams I’d cheered for since I was 5 years old were slim. I thought I’d prepared myself for the denial that was likely to come. But when I read the words, “We regret to inform you,” it was a pretty awful feeling.
The path I thought I was meant to be on had changed, and even though I didn’t realize it then, it was the best twist in the road that fate has ever thrown my way.
The reason why I chose powder blue instead of cardinal at such a young age is still a mystery to the rest of my family. My mom earned her doctorate degree from USC’s Rossier School of Education in 1997, and her father, Grandpa Lou, had always cheered for USC. My older brother, Josh, has been a Trojan since the day of my mom’s graduation ceremony, when he was 6 and I was 5.
Somehow, I must not have been paying attention that day, because whatever Trojan spell had been cast on Josh had no effect on me. As far back as I can remember, I’d always been a Bruin.
My dad has no allegiances to either school, so when USC and UCLA faced off in football or basketball, he would side with me so that the Selbes were evenly split.
Each year, the loser of the annual football game had to take a picture wearing the other school’s colors, and in the 12-plus years I was a UCLA fan, I was on the losing end of that bet nearly every time.
Each time I had to don a cardinal and gold shirt of my brother’s choosing each season after what was usually another lopsided Trojan victory was one of the most painful moments of my childhood, especially considering that I had to watch nearly every beating in person.
From 2001 to 2010, I attended nine out of 10 meetings between the two schools. My lone absence was in 2006, the year UCLA upset then-No. 2 USC, 13-9, at the Rose Bowl.
Missing the Bruins’ only win in the 10 years I had been going to games should have been a sign that Westwood was never the place for me.
Of the schools that did accept me, I decided to go to Arizona State University, where I spent a year as a diehard Sun Devil. Shortly after I arrived in Tempe, Ariz., however, I realized what career path I wanted to embark on — sportswriting.
Southern California is my home, and I always had the idea in the back of my mind that I would apply to transfer to UCLA after two years (per UC transfer rules) and realize my dream.
But after some quick research, I found that UCLA did not have a school for journalism. Another local school, though, did — USC.
After discussing the idea of transferring with my parents, I sent in my application but still wasn’t completely sold on the idea that I might actually go to USC.
When I visited USC for my prospective transfer meeting, however, I saw the school in an entirely different light. I saw a place that had everything — perfect location, a respected journalism school and an elite athletic program. Most of all, though, USC gave me the chance to stay closer to home and spend two years going to college with my brother, who graduated from USC in May 2013 — the perfect example of a Trojan Family.
When I finally started classes, I was worried that I wouldn’t fit in at the school that I was conditioned for years to despise. I knew that I had to get involved with the university somehow, to get to know the “enemy,” so to speak, and see if I could adapt to this new place.
The first campus group I joined was the Daily Trojan, and little did I know that day at the involvement fair what an impact the student newspaper would have on my college experience. In my three years as a staff member, I’ve covered beats for women’s tennis, men’s water polo, women’s basketball and football, written a weekly sports column and served as sports editor.
I’ve poured thousands of words and countless hours into this paper and have met some pretty incredible people along the way that helped give me some of my best memories of my college years.
I’ll always remember covering the 2012 men’s water polo national championship season, and how Jovan Vavic’s unrivaled passion and relentless enthusiasm willed his team to victory. I’ll remember the nervousness I felt the first time I covered a USC football practice. I’ll remember covering the final months of Lane Kiffin’s tenure at USC and feeling like I had an inside look at a man who was mostly reviled, yet I saw as simply misunderstood.
I’ve seen many highs and lows in USC athletics during the last three years, and looking back on it all, I wouldn’t change a thing. This school has helped me grow in a lot of ways, both personally and professionally. The Daily Trojan gave me an experience that helped me realize my passion and taught me lessons that will guide me as I move on to the next phase of my life. One of those lessons is that things don’t always go according to plan, and when they don’t, we have to make the best out of the situation we’re faced with.
In less than three weeks, I will officially be an alumnus of the University of Southern California, which was never the way I envisioned my life was going to end up.
But I’m sure glad that it did.

The USC baseball team is hoping to secure its 10th straight win tonight against the UC Irvine Anteaters after sweeping crosstown rival UCLA last weekend. The Trojans (24-17, 11-9 Pac-12) swept the Bruins for the first time since 2005, thanks to stellar starts on the mound by junior Wyatt Strahan and sophomore Brent Wheatley and key relief pitching by freshman Jeff Paschke and sophomore Kyle Davis.

The Trojans started off the weekend series strong at the plate, handily beating the Bruins 10-0. Friday’s match was more competitive, featuring excellent pitching from both teams, though USC managed to secure the 3-2 win.
Saturday proved to be the series’ most exciting match. After getting off to a very slow start at the plate, the Trojans scored seven runs on seven hits during the top of the ninth inning to come back from a four-run deficit and win 7-4. USC now holds the No. 3 spot in the Pac-12 conference standings while the Bruins fell to No. 6.
As a result of his impressive hitting and fielding during this weekend series, senior Jake Hernandez was named Pac-12 Player of the Week. Hernandez hit .556 and tallied 10 hits during the past four games, including multi-hit outings in each game. In the three games against UCLA, he went 7-13 with four RBIs.
Coming off the exhilarating weekend, the Trojans will face the UC Irvine Anteaters at Dedeaux Field tonight.
USC head coach Dan Hubbs stressed the importance of focusing on tonight’s matchup and avoiding dwelling on last weekend’s huge victory.
“We know what we have in front of us; we know that Irvine is a really good team,” Hubbs said. “We had Sunday to celebrate the sweep, then Monday we practiced and prepared for Irvine. We know what’s at stake. We can’t lose our momentum now. We can only focus on the game right in front of us.”
The Anteaters will enter tonight’s game after sweeping UC Davis last weekend in Davis, Calif. Currently, UC Irvine holds a 28-14 overall record, an 11-5 away game record and an 11-1 record in the Big West conference. The Anteaters are led at the plate by infielders Connor Spencer and Jonathan Munoz, with  .363 and .333 batting averages, respectively.
The last time USC faced UC Irvine, on March 4, the Trojans failed to play their best defensively and fell 6-4 to the Anteaters. All five USC pitchers had trouble on the mound that day and failed to prevent UC Irvine from producing key hits and eventually taking the win.
Two months later, however, Hubbs feels that the Trojans are more than capable of beating the Anteaters.
“I think we’re pretty evenly matched with Irvine going into tonight’s game,” Hubbs said. “We need to pitch well, there’s no doubt. We can’t give them many free bases because they will take advantage of that. They don’t walk many people, so we’re gonna have to be opportunistic when they give us an opportunity to score because they don’t give you a whole lot. I think whoever plays the best will win tonight.”
Though the Trojans have pitched extremely well recently —  especially the starting pitchers — the numbers indicate that UC Irvine might hold the advantage on the mound. Currently, the Anteaters hold an overall team ERA of 2.53 as opposed to the Trojans’ 3.39. The Anteater pitching staff is led by starter Andrew Morales, who currently holds a 7-0 record and an impressive 0.78 ERA.
Sophomore righthander  Brooks Kriske will take the mound for the Trojans tonight at 6 p.m. at USC’s Dedeaux Field.
Despite the growing anticipation for the approaching postseason and mounting pressure to keep the team’s win streak alive, Hubbs stresses the importance of the Trojans remaining calm and focusing on one game at a time.
“We’re in a position now where we could make a serious run at the postseason,” Hubbs said. “We can only worry about the game that’s in front of us. The kids have been doing a good job of that and I think that’s why we’ve got this winning streak going. I just keep telling them, we just have to win one game and then we can worry about the next one. If we do that, then I really think we’re in a position to win tonight and keep this streak going.”
With only 12 games left in the regular season, the Trojans realize they must now concentrate on the areas in which they need most improvement. Though the team holds an impressive nine-game winning streak, Hubbs believes that the Trojans must improve their weak points to make a good run at the NCAA playoffs in May.
“I think we need to continue working on getting that big hit with men in scoring position,” Hubbs said. “In terms of pitching, we just need to be even more consistent on the mound with our starts. The reason we’ve played so well the last couple weeks is because our starting pitching has been good. And that has to stay because if it doesn’t, then we’ll be in trouble. That’s the biggest key is our starting pitching and getting big hits in big spots. More than anything, we’ve just gotta keep it small and play our game the way we know how to play it.”

The No. 1 Women of Troy finished in a tie for second place this past weekend at the Pac-12 Championships. USC failed to defend its conference title, losing by one stroke to No. 7 Stanford at the Trysting Tree Golf Course in Corvallis, Ore. The Women of Troy tied No. 9 Arizona for second place while No. 2 UCLA finished in fourth and No. 4 Arizona State finished fifth to wrap up the top five.

USC’s fourth-ranked player, junior Doris Chen, led the team with a 1-under par performance, placing her in third overall for the tournament. She was followed by sophomores Kyung Kim and Annie Park, who tied for seventh at 2-over par. The team was rounded out by freshman Karen Chung and senior Sophia Popov who finished 29th and 39th, respectively, for the tournament.
Though the USC women had won three of the past six conference tournaments, this year’s 6-over 870 (294-284-292) placed the Women of Troy just out of reach of the conference title.
The Women of Troy came close to forcing a playoff during Sunday’s final round. The team began play roughly one hour ahead of Arizona, Stanford and UCLA, all teams holding a lead over USC. Unfortunately, the team’s 6-over par performance couldn’t quite top that of the Stanford Cardinal.
“I believe any time you lose by a shot, it fuels the fire to prepare for the next tournament,” said USC women’s head coach Andrea Gaston. “Each of our players knows where [she] can make up a stroke, and it’s important to learn from each event.”
UCLA’s Alison Lee won the individual title, becoming the fourth straight freshman to bring home the crown.
The USC men’s golf team, ranked No. 21 in the nation, placed fifth this weekend at the men’s Pac-12 Tournament, which was held at the Gallery Golf Course in Marana, Ariz.
The Trojans combined for a 43-over par (377-363-379-364), while No. 3 Stanford put together a total team effort to post a 2-under par to take home the championship title.
The No. 10-ranked Washington men grabbed the second place trophy at 13-over par, followed by No. 4 California at 27-over par. Unranked Colorado finished fourth at 39-over par, just four strokes ahead of the Trojans.
For the USC men’s team, junior Eric Sugimoto, the team’s fourth-ranked player, finished tied for fourth place in the tournament  after posting a 68 in the final round. Junior Paul Smith followed Sugimoto’s strong performance by tying for ninth overall and senior Jeffrey Kang finished in 31st place. Recently announced Pac-12 Freshman of the Year Rico Hoey tied for 45th place, struggling to a 16-over par finish (78-72-78-73).
Just like the Women of Troy, the USC men’s golf team must look past its fifth-place performance this past weekend to prepare for the men’s NCAA Regionals.
Men’s golf head coach Chris Zambri understands that this fifth-place finish does not represent his team’s potential and he is very optimistic about their final tournaments this season.
“Finishing fifth was not our goal,” Zambri said. “We wanted to win the tournament.  However, the two most important tournaments of the year lay ahead of us. Having Eric [Sugimoto] and Paul [Smith] play the way they did shows me that as a group we can be great. The other three in our top five have had exceptional performances in other events and now Eric and Paul have also.”
As head coaches Gaston and Zambri have indicated, their respective teams still have the biggest competitions remaining on their schedule. Teams filled with individual talent, the men’s and women’s golf teams prepare themselves for long seasons in order to adapt and learn from both great and disappointing tournaments.
Zambri speaks for both golf programs when he talks about the opportunity awaiting the Trojan golfers in the upcoming weeks.
“We can make this a magical season if these five great players play well at the same time in the coming NCAA Regional and NCAA Final,” Zambri said. “I think they will.”

As much as I love my moody Radiohead music, if I could set my life to a certain soundtrack, it would be completely Beyoncé songs. This playlist would include a throwback to Destiny’s Child’s “Bills, Bills, Bills,” then move on to Queen Bey’s solo work such as “Crazy in Love” and “Single Ladies.” I think what I enjoy most about Beyoncé’s songs is that they always instill a sense of empowerment in me, and that is why it was completely fitting for her to grace the U.S. cover of Time magazine’s “100 Most Influential People.” Rocking long hair and a white bodysuit, Time’s recognition of Beyoncé signifies a shift in our perception of power.

Influence is a hard factor to measure, as it’s not something marked by the most popular celebrity of the moment. Someone with a lot of exposure, meaning significant media attention, could have little effect on society, while others without the spotlight could be instrumental in society. For example, Snooki, though inspiring me to get my gym-tan-laundry on, has little bearing on my life. General Motors CEO Mary Barra, however, is the first female CEO of any major automaker, but is someone I wasn’t really familiar with until she too graced the international cover of that 2014 “Most Influential” edition.
In 2007, Time’s managing editor Richard Stengel wrote, “What we look for is people whose ideas, whose example, whose talent, whose discoveries transform the world we live in. Influence is less about the hard power of force than the soft power of ideas and example.” Beyoncé not only defies the standard notion of male dominance, but she also dissolves racial barriers. Her cover is revolutionary, as it not only calls all people to challenge the social norms, but also models a realistic picture of the composition of people.
First, Beyoncé’s cover is a celebration of women. She is the mascot of this year’s record-making 41 women featured on the top 100 list. Sure, Beyoncé has made some disheartening comments that made me question her feminist credentials in the past, and her cover boasts her exuding sexuality, a trait which compliments more masculine tastes. She recognized the issue of gender inequality in January for Maria Shriver’s The Shriver Report, however, reiterating her stance that women should receive all the opportunities as men. A more cynical me would say that this image could be a marketing ploy, but her words and her support of women is truly inspirational. Her words, written, vocal and musical, are a catalyst for abolishing that deeply rooted inequality, and Time magazine highlights that empowered fight.
Following Beyoncé’s cover, actress Lupita Nyong’o recently nabbed the highly coveted People’s Most Beautiful title. Together, these covers added to the popularity of the  worldwide Twitter trending topic, #whatispretty, which originated after Beyoncé’s “Pretty Hurts” music video. This is a message to the audience that beauty is not just a tall, skinny Caucasian girl, but beauty comes in varieties exceeding that boxed notion. These covers underscore that beauty has the power to change the world. It’s not just sex appeal, or being “pretty,” but rather how to use the ideal conventions of beauty to change our antiquated notions.
These superlative lists often commemorate a figure for having done a remarkable thing in a certain year, but what Beyoncé and Nyong’o are doing is current and will happen in the future.
Using Stengel’s criteria for measuring influence, Beyoncé has allowed at least me to feel strength in my gender and my race. It is a feat that is remarkable and worthy of Time’s title but also shows that we can defy antiquated social institutions. It makes me optimistic about the future knowing that Beyoncé is out there being a beacon of change with her actions. So yes, when Queen Bey says, “Bow down,” you bet I will.

The United States brokered peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians deteriorated Thursday following the Israeli diplomatic-security cabinet’s unanimous vote to terminate negotiations, according to CNN. The decision came amid the announcement of reconciliation between rival Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, both of which have ruled separately for the last seven years.
This accord will set the stage for a united Palestinian government representing both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, with the promise of elections to be held within the following six months, according to the BBC.
Israel immediately condemned the agreement, accusing Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and the Palestinian Authority of preventing any means of having real peace.  He further reiterated Israel’s refusal to negotiate with any government that doesn’t recognize its right to exist (though let’s keep in mind that President Abbas has been negotiating with the most right-wing coalition in Israel’s history, within which two parties — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s own Likud party and the HaBayit HaYehudi party — unapologetically deny the right of a Palestinian state to exist).
“He has to choose,” Prime Minister Netanyahu said of President Abbas in a statement. “Does he want peace with Hamas or peace with Israel? You can have one but not the other. I hope he chooses peace, so far he hasn’t done so.”
Others, however, don’t share Netanyahu’s distress. The European Union praised the Palestinian reconciliation, reaffirming the importance of any new Palestinian leadership’s commitment to achieving a two-state solution, which includes recognizing Israel’s right to exist.
And that is exactly how President Abbas has promised he will lead. In fact, it’s how he has led since the Oslo Accords in 1993. Abbas has presented his conditions for a two-state solution: a state of Palestine based on pre-1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital, with a mutually agreed upon solution to the Right of Return and the Palestinian refugees. Though Israel has every right to doubt the intentions of Hamas, which has made no secret of its refusal to recognize Israel, to assume that President Abbas’ stance would suddenly change is ridiculous, as is the assumption that Palestinian unity would somehow change the fact that a majority of Palestinians support a two-state solution. Rather than dismiss reconciliation as a step back, it’s high time Israel recognize the opportunity — both for a unified Palestinian leadership to carry out its international commitments and, perhaps for the first time, for tangible peace.
In a statement, President Abbas reaffirmed his commitment to achieving a two-state solution to the conflict, adding that there is “no incompatibility between reconciliation and the talks.”
And he’s right. If anything, the only disingenuous thing was negotiating in the absence of Palestinian unity in the first place. For too long, the issue of Gaza has remained the elephant in the negotiating room. No one is denying it. In fact, the inability of President Abbas to represent all Palestinians in a final agreement has long been one of Israel’s chief concerns.
This concern can finally be laid to rest — if Israel’s leadership will let it.
It is still unclear what this process will look like. But to completely dismiss the reunification of the Palestinian people will be a failure to recognize the critical opportunity unification could play in achieving a two-state solution in the region, as well as a failure to realize that Israelis and Palestinians simply won’t see peace without it. Palestinians are in great need of legitimate leadership that represents both the West Bank and Gaza and this unification is a start.

Palestinians have in their government groups that don’t recognize Israel,
And Israel has groups that don’t recognize Palestine, even more extreme, the Israeli government has members who deny the existence of Palestinians and ,actually , the Isrseli leadership is currently based on right wing expansionist policies.
If you can’t negotiate with people you disagree with , who are you suppose to talk to? Yourself?
Israel has already negotiated directly with both HAMAS and with the Lebanese Hezbollah.
Why is this time any different?
When the PLO and Yasser Arafat signed the Oslo Peace, which was to lead to a just 2 state agreement finalized in 5 years, back in 1993, the PLO and Arafat were considered terror groups by Israel and the US.
Every excuse the current Israeli leadership has stated is for the most part, word for word, exactly what the South African Whites argued.
The Blacks were going to drive the whites into the sea, they can’t negotiate with terror groups like the ANC and N

There
is no “Palestine”. There might have been, but they chose war instead-
time and again:
The
would-have-been “Palestinians” would have had a state IN PEACE in 1937 with the
Peel Plan, but they violently rejected it.
They
would have had a state IN PEACE in 1939 with the MacDonald White Paper, but
they violently rejected it (and Jews would have even been restricted from
BUYING land from Arabs).
They
would have had a state IN PEACE in 1948 with UN 181, but they violently
rejected it (and actually claimed that the UN had no such mandate!).
They
could have had a state IN PEACE in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza from 1948-1967
without any Jews- because the Arabs had ethnically cleansed every last one; but
they violently rejected it. In fact, that’s exactly when they established Fatah
(1959) and the PLO (1964).
They
could have had a state IN PEACE after 1967, but instead, the entire Arab world
issued the Khartoum Resolutions:
A. No
peace with Israel
B. No recognition of Israel
C. No negotiations with Israel
They
would have had a state IN PEACE in 2000 with the Oslo Accords, but they
violently rejected it- as always.
And as
soon as Israel pulled every single Israeli out of Gaza, what did the
would-have-been “Palestinians” do? They immediately started shooting thousands
of missiles into Israeli population centers, they elected Hamas (whose official
platform calls for jihad with no negotiations until Israel is destroyed) to
rule them, and they have dug tunnels crossing into the Negev to kill and kidnap
Israelis.
And even
afterwards, Ehud Olmert made his subsequent generous offer that went far beyond
even that of Barak. The would-have-been “Palestinians” rejected it.
They had
many chances.
They
threw them all away because destroying Israel was higher on their priority
list. It still is.
Oh well.
That’s their choice.
Sorry but Even our Country refuses to Negotiate with Terrorists. The Fact that the Terrorist Hamas have joined with the PLO. You can’t negotiate in good faith with Terrorists.
Travis
You don’t negotiate with your friends
You negotiate with your enemies.
Did you forget that Israel was founded on terrorism?
Menachem Begin was the most wanted terrorist by Interpol before being voted by Israelis as their leader. Ariel Sharon’s claim to fame was throwing grenades inside the homes of non combatants he knew had primarily women, children, and elderly Palestinians.
Palestinians deserve to have their stories told, free from outside oppression and subjugation, and to have their civil and human rights restored
Salah, your prophet’s practice (as is recorded in the Muslim
hadiths) was to sign peace treaties only when brute force would not work, i.e.,
when he was forced to retreat.  If
brute  force would work to conquer a
people than Mohammed used it. If not he signed a treaty and abided by it only
so long as it took to rebuild his strength at which time Mohammed would pretend
the treaty had never existed.
Now the Palestinian’s through their proxy armies – Egypt,
Syria, Jordan, etc…- have invaded Israel time and time again only to be
embarrassed on the field of battle, so they now fight Israel in the field of
words. They twist words to trick, fool, delegitimize and to win the war of
words. In this battle field the Palestinians are winning, and your article is
more of the same.
Those who seriously believe the Palestinians – or any
Muslims for that matter – will ever allow Jews to live peacefully in Israel live
in an Alice in Wonderland world.  Muslims
are currently ethnically cleansing the Christians out of your homeland (Egypt)
and out of Sudan, Pakistan, Iraq, Nigeria and elsewhere too. Muslims are
currently ethnically cleansing Animists out of Sudan, Somalia, Mali and
elsewhere too. Muslims are ethnically cleansing the gays out of Muslim lands,
the Bahia out of Muslim lands, the Zoroastrians out of Muslim lands. Muslims
are ethnically cleansing Hindus from their ancient homelands of Pakistan and
Bangladesh.
Yet you would have us believe Muslims will make peace with
the Jews of Israel? Now why would anyone other than a naïve college idealist
believe this could possibly happen. Muslims cannot even make peace among
themselves – a day does not go by when we don’t read of Muslims brutalizing
Muslims – so why would Israeli politicians risk their people’s lives on a
treaty that isn’t worth the paper it’s written on per ancient Islamic tenets?

In the final weekend before the summer season, the box office was alive and kicking.
After dominating the last three weekends, Captain America: The Winter Soldier finally lost the No. 1 spot to the revenge romantic comedy The Other Woman, which wrangled $24.76M. While not as strong as Cameron Diaz’s 2011 hit Bad Teacher, which is now a show on CBS, it’s still a strong opening for a romantic comedy, especially in a weekend that, at least until recently, used to be a dead zone for films.
Starring Diaz, Leslie Mann and Kate Upton as three women getting back at the womanizing man that’s been lying and cheating with all three of them (Game of Thrones’ Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), The Other Woman did a good job of playing up the shenanigans and dynamics between the three female leads.  While it’s nothing new plot-wise (the film is essentially a younger, blonder version of The First Wives Club), it played to the strengths of the characters — and yes, we’re counting Upton’s ditziness as a strength.
Directed by Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook and My Sister’s Keeper), one of the film’s major draws is, sadly, the novelty of a film featuring three female leads. While the romantic comedy genre has seen more busts than breakouts lately (unless you want to count Silver Linings Playbook), this was able to appeal to an audience that, it bears reminding, comprises of 52 percent of moviegoers.
The next three films were also the top three films last week. Captain America had another large drop to $16.2M for a total of $225.1M and an international total of $645.36M.
The faith-based breakout Heaven is for Real finished in third with $14.35M, bringing its total to $52.46M. This is a film that cost only $12M, so everything from here on out is icing on the cake.
In fourth was Rio 2 with $13.88M and a total just shy of $96.39M. Its pace is still behind the first Rio, but Blue Sky Studios and 20th Century Fox should still be happy with the result — not to mention it’ll be the only animated option for families throughout the month of May.
The second new release of the weekend, Brick Mansions, opened at fifth place with $9.5M. An American remake of the Luc Besson-produced parkour thriller District B13, this film was notable for being the last film that starred Paul Walker, who died last year in a car accident. Also starring David Belle and RZA, trailers and other marketing played it straight with Walker’s presence without seeming insensitive.

While the film was never expected to set the world on fire (the original District B13 was more of a cult film than a blockbuster even in international markets), the billing of Paul Walker likely gave this film more awareness than it normally would have. And while the reviews were poor, the film seemed to show an actor that was coming into his own as a lead, making his loss that much harder.
At seventh place was the third new release of the weekend, The Quiet Ones, which opened to an awful $3.88M. That’s just a third of what Oculus opened to just two weekends ago, which many pundits considered a disappointment. Starring Jared Harris, Sam Claflin and Olivia Cooke, the film dealt with a more intriguing slant on the paranormal genre, loosely based on a controversial parapsychology experiment from the seventies.
But the marketing hit just about every cliche in the book. Even with the prestige of coming from Hammer Film Productions, the historical British Gothic horror studio that recently came back to prominence with The Woman in Black, the film just couldn’t distinguish itself, leading to one of the worst openings ever for a paranormal horror wide release.
But beyond that doom and gloom, next week is the start of what should be an epic summer season, with a range of anticipated superhero movies (Amazing Spider-Man 2, X-Men: Days of Future Past), comedies (Neighbors, 22 Jump Street), sequels (How To Train Your Dragon 2, Transformers: Age of Extinction), and even the King of the Monsters (Godzilla). It should be a blast!
