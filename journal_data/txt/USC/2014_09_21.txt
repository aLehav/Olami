Oliver Franke, a senior lecturer of aerospace and mechanical engineering at the Viterbi School of Engineering, died Thursday morning at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of a heart attack.
“Oliver contributed greatly to our teaching mission,” wrote Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yortsos in a memorandum sent to Viterbi faculty and staff on Thursday. “He was an outstanding instructor.”
Franke had received an engineering diploma and a doctorate from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 2005 and 2009 respectively. Franke was with the Department of Materials Sciences and Engineering at MIT until he joined the USC faculty in 2010 as a visiting assistant professor.
Franke, who was named a senior lecturer in the fall of 2012, was married to Viterbi aerospace and materials science professor, Andrea Hodge.
“This has hit all of us very hard because [Oliver and Andrea] are very likeable people, and so it’s a significant loss for not only us but for [Andrea] as well,” Yortsos said.
Students in Franke’s classes remember him for his enthusiasm and eagerness to teach. Kevin Chan, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, was in two of Franke’s classes.
“He encouraged our participation and even went as far as to give us chocolate for our efforts,” Chan said. “He reminded me that teaching and learning is more so a dialogue than a speech.”
Vincy Chan, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, said that Franke was known for his ability to engage students in the classroom and inspire his students to become better engineers.
“I think my words fail to describe the impact Dr. Franke had on my academic and professional life,” Vincy Chan said. “He was truly one of the most inspirational and influential mentors I’ve had.”
Viterbi will hold a memorial service for Franke at the Caruso Catholic Center next week. The time and date are to be announced. Franke is survived by Hodge.
“It’s very sad to have one of your colleagues pass away, particularly at a young age,” Yortsos said. “His family and wife are in our thoughts and prayers.”
 
Thanks for this article about Oliver. We will miss him tremendously….

The FreeBike Project, a startup launched by former USC students that provides eco-friendly transportation, is expanding its reach to about 800 bikes nationwide by the semester’s end.
Ads on wheels · Students pay a yearly deposit for free bicycles. The company is funded by advertisement revenue from the bicycle itself. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The service allows students to pay a deposit to lease a bike for the school year. Since its founding in 2011, FreeBike Project has expanded to more than 20 campuses.
The founders, Johan Bender, 24, and Kim Sanderhoff, 35, came up with the idea when they were study abroad students at USC.  The Danish duo met during their Introduction to Entrepreneurship course at the Marshall School of Business during fall 2011. They decided to stay for a full academic year after the FreeBike Project took off.
 
“It was just completely arbitrary that we ended up in the same class –— and then because we were both from Denmark, we ended up working together for the final project and that’s when we started the FreeBike Project,” Sanderhoff said.
The company has recently launched a project with the Bikes for the World organization to donate a bike every week. The project is a social media effort that involves the FreeBike Project riders submitting a photograph of themselves and their FreeBike Project bicycle. Riders post their photographs on a social media outlet with the hashtag #bikesfortheworld and the company pledges to donate a bicycle per week in the name of the user with the best photo for the week.
Sanderhoff, the company’s chief operations officer, was a model, actor and member of the Royal Danish Army before starting his undergraduate studies at the Copenhagen Business School.  He was born in South Korea and grew up in a small town in Denmark. After serving for the Royal Danish Army, he spent nine years living in South Korea.
Sanderhoff’s interest in entrepreneurship developed during his years as a student in Denmark, where he studied business and psychology. He took this interest to the United States when he arrived at USC during the summer of 2011.
“I felt at home at USC, people are so ambitious,” he said.
His partner, Johan Bender, received his undergraduate degree in business and finance from the Copenhagen Business School.  Bender focuses on the marketing and sales division of the company while Sanderhoff handles the day-to-day global operations. Bender is currently in the Danish offices of FreeBike Project and could not be reached for a comment.
“In five years I see the FreeBike Project active all around the country, and if that ends up happening, in 10 [years] I hope to see it all around the world,” Sanderhoff said.
Students participating in the project are also excited about where the company is heading.
Kathryn Rosenfeld, a junior majoring in chemical engineering, has used the FreeBike Project since the beginning of her sophomore year.
“I remember seeing them advertise bikes all over when I was a freshman,” Rosenfeld said. “One time I went up to someone and asked them how they got them, and they just told me to google FreeBike Project USC so I did, and I found their website.”
She said that the advertising on the bicycles also calls attention to the bicycles themselves.
“People come up to me actually pretty often and ask me about it, and I actually tell them the exact same thing,” she said.
Students were impressed by the company’s mission.
“It seems like a very interesting opportunity for a new company to be heading in the direction of both international philanthropy as well as positive eco-friendly contributions to the planet,” said Juan Ramirez, a junior majoring in global health.
Ramirez said a plan involving giving free bikes to students and also providing the rest of the world with free bikes is a novel idea.
“Where is the profit? – Its gives me hope in the current system, when business people have ‘giving as a goal,” Ramirez said.

On Friday, USC hosted the groundbreaking ceremony for Jill and Frank Fertitta Hall, a new building for the Marshall School of Business.
The hall, which is scheduled to be completed by May 2016, will be located at the southeast corner of the University Park campus at the intersection of Figueroa Street and Exposition Drive. It will open in time for classes beginning in the fall semester of 2016.
The Fertitta family donated the lead gift for the 102,000-square-foot, five-story building. The cost of the building has not been disclosed.
Frank Fertitta, a USC alumnus who graduated from Marshall in 1984, is the owner of Fertitta Entertainment, a company that develops and manages resorts and casinos, and of Station Casinos, the largest provider of gaming entertainment in Southern Nevada.
“He would end the meeting every single time with, ‘If you need something, call me.’ And that is a perfect example of the Trojan family,” Marshall Dean James Ellis said of Fertitta during his speech.
“When [President C. L.] Max [Nikias] and [Ellis] approached me with the possibility of helping out on a new building for undergraduate students, Jill and I immediately recognized the significance of the opportunity and what it would mean to the school,” Fertitta said during the ceremony.
Fertitta said that education was an important part of his philanthropic efforts.
“The two of us feel very fortunate to be able to make a gift to the Marshall School of Business that will help improve the educational environment and give the undergraduate students a home they can call their own.,” Fertitta said. “I think a world-class business school like USC deserves to have a world-class facility, and that’s what today is all about with the ground breaking.”
Fertitta Hall aims to expand and modernize Marshall’s student experience. The building is expected to increase the school’s undergraduate student capacity by nearly one-third.
According to the building’s information page on Marshall’s website, the hall will contain 20 classrooms and two lecture halls that can accomodate up to 149 students each. All the classrooms will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology including cameras that support interactive web conferencing with guest speakers.
“It’s fabulous, one of the things to walk around and see is all of these fabulous new buildings we have, and what Fertitta Hall is going to do for the business school is transformative,” Amy Ross, president of the Alumni Association Board of Governors, said at the end of the ceremony.
Sophia Doyle, a sophomore majoring in business administration, was among the Marshall students at the event. She gave a speech in praise of Fertitta Hall as a home to Marshall’s undergraduate students that will continue to foster a spirit of entrepreneurialism.
“I have an idea, [and] Fertitta Hall will give me a place to go and build it,” Doyle said.

To kick off its second semester as a campus organization, Motivate & Empower (M&E) held its first THINK Conversation, a student-facilitated social issues discussion, on Saturday in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Forum. The event, titled “A Day in the Life of ME,” provided a forum for USC students to not only verbalize their views on relevant topics such as gender inequality and inaccessibility of education, but to also create a plan of action for M&E to address these issues in the community.
Think it over · The Motivate & Empower organization encourages students to utilize discussions as a “brave space” to discuss issues. – Carol Kim | Daily Trojan
 
According to the organization’s website, M&E aims to inspire a positive leadership movement on college campuses by serving as a catalyst and support network for student action. The THINK Conversation was designed as one aspect of the organization’s motto, “Think. React. Change.” This semester, the organization plans to add a new component to its existing framework through student-proposed M&E CHANGE Initiatives that help better the overall human experience at USC and in the surrounding area.
“At USC, it’s hard to separate yourself from what you look like or the color of your skin,” M&E Vice President of Community Outreach Cecilia Quintana said.
The founding chapter of M&E was officially launched at USC in March by now-sophomore international relations major Maya Carter, who serves as president of the organization. Since then, the organization’s reach has rapidly expanded, with new chapters formed on other campuses such as Loyola Marymount University.
Several LMU students belonging to the university’s new M&E chapter attended Saturday’s THINK Conversation.
At the event on Saturday, students were asked to list labels that were imposed on them by others on campus. Terms named included “b-tch,” “ethnic,” “ghetto” and “privileged.”
To foster an open dialogue about these titles, Carter then asked students, “What limits you in this box? Why did you place yourself here? What are some unique passions you have that you wish more people knew about?”
Members of the M&E leadership team encouraged students to treat the THINK Conversation as a “brave space,” meaning that conversations should be honest and open without fear of judgment.
Students’ responses were candid.
“I visit my USC friends’ homes, and it seems like one door opens to Beverly Hills and their other door opens to Bel-Air, and, ‘Oh yeah, Beyonce just moved in down the street,’” said Tucker Aust, a sophomore majoring in theatre. “There is definitely a perception at this school that everyone is extremely affluent, and it can be alienating at times.”
The diverse group of students broke into small groups and discussed each other’s responses. Before the THINK Conversation concluded, students were asked to create a plan to change how people discuss these labels and stereotypes on campus, using their individual passions.
Janaé Headly, a sophomore who serves as M&E’s vice president of public relations, felt that the first THINK Conversation accurately reflected the organization’s mission.
“The diverse groups of students that came together — not only from ’SC but from other college campuses also — show that students want to make a difference,” she said. “They just need the necessary resources and information to do so, which is what we hope to provide.”

This was a much-needed bye week for the Trojans, a chance to regroup. Not just from the devastating loss to the Boston College Eagles, but from a whirlwind first month of the college football season. The debut season for coach Steve Sarkisian and Co. has been chaotic to say the least.
From fake stories of heroism to allegations of racism, USC was under the microscope before they even kicked off against Fresno State. Couple that with a tremendous victory against the Bulldogs and a triumphant upset of the Stanford Cardinal and emotions have been running high for the Trojans. The disappointing showing against BC just continued the roller coaster ride that has been the Trojans 2014 season.
Now after the proverbial initial storm has passed, the team and fans alike have a chance to take a breath and reflect on the short season that has been and the upcoming Pac-12 schedule.
Sure, there are still some unanswered questions at this point. Namely, will an infuriatingly conservative offense continue to be the norm this season? Or will the team come out against Oregon State firing like offensive coordinator Clay Helton had them playing against Fresno State?
There are other issues regarding the Trojans’ thin defense that are also up in the air. There is, however, a lot we do know at this point in the season, things that foreshadow a very bright future. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler has taken the next step in his development. Fellow junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor has emerged as the most dependable third down target at USC since Robert Woods in his sophomore season. Junior defensive end Leonard Williams and sophomore safety Su’a Cravens have more than justified their prodigious preseason praise, wreaking havoc on opponents.
More than anything else though, the future is rosy because of an unbelievable freshman class. When the sanctions limiting scholarships were handed down a few years back, some Trojan fans posited that the penalties weren’t, in fact, crippling. This optimistic, but ultimately naïve, opinion was based on the premise that the Trojans would have to run their program like an NFL organization.
NFL teams only carry 53-man rosters, and at its lowest point USC would be down near that number of scholarship players. All this meant was that USC couldn’t miss often in recruiting. Unfortunately, over the last four years, the Trojans have missed out spectacularly when it comes to recruiting.
Each year, the Trojans have brought in a nationally ranked class, yet the results have been tepid at best. Sure, there are the bright spots, like the aforementioned players above, as well as steals like redshirt running back Javorius “Buck” Allen and former defensive end Morgan Breslin. For the most part, however, past USC recruiting classes have failed to live up to expectations.
Whether this is a lack of player development, the revolving door of position coaches or poor talent evaluation when the players were in high school is anyone’s best guess. The fact remains that highly touted recruiting classes have floundered overall.
That seems to have changed this year. Three games in, and the freshmen for the Trojans are making an undeniable impact. The crown jewel of the class, wide receiver/defensive back Adoree’ Jackson, might actually be better than advertised.
Jackson already is the best cover corner in the secondary. His return skills are so feared that teams are already kicking away from him. Not to mention the fact that though he has touched the ball sparingly on offense, he is a threat to score every time he gets his gloves on the pigskin.
He is just the tip of the iceberg. Wide receiver/defensive back JuJu Smith is a physical phenom with the potential to go down as the best Trojan receiver ever. His rare mix of speed and power combined with a penchant for elusive moves is truly remarkable. Wideout Ajene Harris was a revelation in camp in the slot, and once he learns all the receiver positions, I think he will be the steal of this recruiting class.
The offensive line is really where the Trojans have found success. A much maligned position group over the past few years, the influx of young talent has been impressive, the Boston College game notwithstanding. At just under 400 pounds, the speed at which guard Damien Mama executes pull blocks has to strike fear in the hearts of defenses up and down the coast. Toa Lobendahn has already cemented himself as a fixture at right guard, and guard Viane Talamaivao almost ran step-for-step with the receivers when Allen scored on his screen pass last week.
There are others who have already made an impact, like tight end Bryce Dixon, and I’m sure more players will develop along the way. USC’s trio of highly touted cornerbacks is sure to produce one stalwart to play opposite Jackson over the next few years.
Regardless of whether every player in the 2014 class makes an impact, the Trojans already have the foundation for the future. Top-tier talent is what dynasties are built on. With a couple more classes like this, USC will be well on its way.

When most people think of USC’s student-athletes, they only think about their sports and not much else, but what about their academics and life in general?
Well-balanced · Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler attributes his success on and off the field to perseverance and networking skills. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
Last week, redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler, senior forward Alexyz Vaioletama, redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen, senior swimmer Stina Gardell, senior outside linebacker J.R. Tavai and senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley spoke about balancing all of their responsibilities.
Topics ranged from advice about classes to motivation to careers.
Vaioletama and Tavai — both Samoan — talked about their heritage, family life and the impact on their success as athletes. Both discussed how important their families were in their lives.
“I had to play the big role of being the older brother to my five younger siblings,” Tavai said.
Allen shared about his experiences in his classes.
“If you need help, get it,” Allen said. “Growing up I always thought help was a bad thing — I looked at it like a weakness.”
Being the first in his family to go to college, Allen emphasized that students should take advantage of their opportunities and not be afraid to ask their professors for help.
“If I didn’t do it, I knew no one else was going to do it for me.” Allen said.
Kessler recalled his early years at USC, when he lost out on the starting quarterback job twice.
“I could either take the easy way out and transfer,” Kessler said. “Or I could stick to it and work hard.”
Stanley, who transferred to USC from Missouri in the spring of 2012, shared about her previous experiences and adapting to life in Los Angeles. Stanley chose to leave Missouri after she ran into some issues with her coach who switched her to forward.
“That’d be like putting Cody as O-line,” Stanley said. “You just don’t do that … It doesn’t make sense.”
Growing up in the Midwest, she added that the diversity shocked her the most when she first came to USC.
“It’s been the coolest experience,” Stanley said. “I came out here and it’s been the best decision of my life and the best thing that could happen to me.”
Vaioletama said that of her favorite parts about USC is the relationships she has formed; she’s had teammates from Australia, Canada, and Russia.
“It not only helped me with my success, but it’s helped me just through life in general,” Vaioletama said.
Kessler added that he really appreciates the networking opportunities at USC.
“My advice for you guys from a relationship standpoint: Go out there,” Kessler said. “Go to events. Go meet people. Even just mention your name because sometimes it can help you out in the future.”
Allen revealed that he plans to play in the NFL and said that his career goals are anything but selfish.
“I stopped doing it for myself a long time ago,” Allen said.
Instead, Allen draws inspiration from his family to keep him working hard.
When asked about his career goal outside of a life in sports, Tavai said he’d be a chef. He was inspired by his mother who cooked for seven kids.
Gardell studied international relations and aims to get her Master’s degree in Sweden.
“My goal is to work with Interpol,” Gardell said.
Both Kessler and Stanley share aspirations to stay close to sports and work in broadcasting and sports media.
Vaioletama mentioned that she would be interested in pursuing a career in the military, as others in her family have.
Allen reflected on his memories at the Boys and Girls Club when discussing his career goals.
“All it takes is one person to believe in you,” Allen said. “No matter what it is, if you want to be a doctor, a lawyer, anything, it just takes one person to believe in you.”
Allen continued, “After the NFL, I’ll do something with kids through the Boys and Girls Club.”
Overall, the night was a good chance for the athletes to relate to their fellow students.
good story, inspiring

The No. 3 men’s water polo team suffered its first loss of the season on Sunday at the Kap7 NorCal Classic. The Trojans (10-1) racked up two wins against top-20 teams in the early rounds, but fell 9-7 to No. 2 UCLA in the semifinals.
Greek freak · Senior driver Kostas Genidounias came up big for the Trojans at the Kap7 NorCal Classic this weekend, scoring seven goals in three games. The four-year starter leads the team with 32 goals so far this season. – Christoper Roman | Daily Trojan
The first game of the tournament was a rematch of the Trojans’ previous encounter against No. 19 Air Force; the results were very similar as USC took the match 20-7. Nonetheless, head coach Jovan Vavic said that the team approached the game differently than last time.
“The first time we played them, they were very tired,” Vavic said. “They played four games prior to playing us, so we knew they would be much more physically exhausted in the game we played in Redlands. This game was the first game of the tournament, so we knew they’d be playing a little better.”
The Trojans, as usual, started out hot with a 6-0 surge. In the end, eleven different scorers helped put the game away for this deep Trojan squad, including senior driver Rex Butler who led the game and the day in scoring for the Trojans. According to Vavic, though, Butler was not always a great collegiate scorer.
“He’s become a better shooter,” Vavic said. “He was an excellent shooter when he came to us but wasn’t very confident. He would miss a shot and then he would shut down.”
Vavic talked about Butler, emphasizing his all-around improvement.
“Rex [Butler] is a mature player right now,” Vavic said. “He’s been with the program for four and a half years. He’s much more confident and much stronger. He was not physically strong when he first started playing for us. Now he’s a veteran. He knows the system. He has improved his defense very much.”
Their second game against UC Santa Barbara was a much fiercer contest, but whenever the Gauchos got close, the Trojans started to pull away. USC surged again to a 3-0 lead at the start. The Gauchos cut the lead to 6-5 in the third, and again to 8-6. After that point, however, the Trojans were in control, eventually winning 12-7.
In addition to Butler, senior driver Kostas Genidounias came out strong on Saturday. Together they are a key part to this team’s success.
“They have a great understanding of each other’s movements in the water,” Vavic said. “They complement each other really well because both of them are good shooters but also are very good passers, and both are accomplished players. Having these two makes the opponent worry about what we can do.”
The two seniors were near the top of the scoring lists in both games Saturday. Butler led scoring against Air Force in the first with four goals while Genidounias was tied for third with two scores. Against UC Santa Barbara, Genidounias led scoring with three goals, while Butler was tied for second with two goals.
In addition to the two veterans, freshman goalie McQuin Baron also made a big impact for the Trojans on Saturday with a career-high 15 saves against the Gauchos. His previous high was 14 against Pacific earlier this season.
The Trojans headed into Sunday never having trailed a minute of the season. But UCLA has been a thorn in USC’s side over the past few seasons and lived up to its reputation.
USC fell behind 2-0 early on and finished up the first quarter at a 3-2 deficit. The Trojans fought their way to the forefront though, heading into halftime with a 5-4 lead. The two powerhouses traded goals throughout the third quarter. The Bruins took over in the fourth, though. USC had a 7-6 lead, but UCLA surged for three straight goals to win the game 9-7 and end the Trojans’ NorCal Classic title aspirations.
Vavic reiterated the inexperience of his team but remained optimistic for the future.
“We have so many new players,” he said. “I have confidence in this group … They know how to win.”

As restaurants in Los Angeles go, few concepts have the vision and ambition to conquer the old Towne Food & Drink space at the foot of the WaterMarke Tower in Downtown. The $4 million restaurant shuttered in March 2013, and it paved the way for the next big restaurateur to make its mark in what is becoming one of the nation’s most demanding (and intriguing) food scenes. Earlier this year, Rob Weakley and David Bernahl, the people behind the L.A. Food & Wine Festival, set out to meet the challenge with their restaurant, Faith & Flower.
I’m so fancy · With elaborate, studied dishes, such as the delicious deviled eggs, Faith & Flower works hard to impress your eyes and palate. — Razan Al Marzouqi | Daily Trojan
The first thing to notice upon walking in to Faith & Flower is that the restaurant is gorgeous: The designers at AvroKO eschew the modern (and frankly, tired) industrialist aesthetic favored by every “hip” restaurant in Los Angeles, and opt instead for crisply folded floor-to-ceiling drapery and Art Deco-inspired dimpled leather booths. Planet-like clusters of ornate orb-lighting dominate the lined ceilings, and a tiered chandelier in the main dining room practically drips with Belle Epoque-era opulence. Small touches like a wall appointed with ostrich feathers invoke images of 1920s flappers and walnut woods lend the restaurant an old, opulent feel without falling victim to the stodgy, white tablecloth-draped austerity of outdated steakhouses.
Considering the ambiance of the space, the food and beverage at Faith & Flower has a great deal to live up to. Lead Mixologist Michael Lay’s beverage program answers the call — his English Milk Punch is already a favorite among the cocktail cognoscenti. Those more inclined to the familiar might try the Harry Winston: Lay’s twist on an Old Fashioned uses Japanese blended whiskey, teapot bitters, King’s Ginger and Okinawa black sugar to lend Don Draper’s drink of choice an irresistibly floral nose with a citrusy undercurrent that smells deceptively more like yuzu than the flamed orange peel listed on the menu.
The restaurant’s cocktails are, of course, a predecessor to the food, and with Executive Chef Michael Hung at the reins, Faith & Flower seems to be in good hands. Though Los Angeles Times food critic Jonathan Gold was gently critical of the chef’s execution in a review earlier this summer, Hung seems to have improved his craft and slightly re-tooled the ingredients in his menu.
The servers term Hung’s style as “tapas plus,” or as a slightly larger version of tapas dishes that are meant to be shared. The menu itself draws from an assortment of disparate culinary cultures: vadouvan (curry spice) crème-fraîche finds itself on a bed of crushed potatoes, Korean kimchi mingles with the yolk in a perfect deviled egg and chile verde and carnitas crowns a wood-fired pizza.
For starters and small bites, the Kanpachi Ceviche is an absolute must. Hung’s Kennebec potato chips are at once airy and substantive, holding up nicely against the ginger beer-adulterated Kanpachi and citrus. It’s a whimsical dish that could stand on its own legs as a cocktail snack — just make sure to leave some for the other guests.
Hung, who honed his traditional French skills at San Francisco mainstays Jardinière and the Michelin-starred La Folie, draws from his experiences in his time with Traci Des Jardins for some of his proteins. Hung’s duck confit is aptly executed, with the fork-tender dark meat falling apart like a slow-cooked pork shoulder. The woodsy, autumnal notes are only further accented by the watercress soubise and sweet peaches. At $17 for a portion that could serve as a main course, it’s also a surprising bargain.
In following with the comfort theme, the popular oxtail agnolotti is textbook al dente and served with bone marrow butter. It’s well executed and savory without being unctuous, though it might be a tad too understated. Vegetables are not standard steamed or sautéed affairs; instead, Hung infuses them with flavor to better suit a pairing with the proteins. Broccolini with anchovy salsa, for instance, would pair with the ribeye with vermouth and oyster jus. Sauteed Blue Lake green beans come topped with bay shrimp gremolata to pair them with Faith & Flower’s seafood dishes, which include an exquisite, melting-tender black cod. It would be remiss to neglect mention of the pizzas, which are fantastic. Faith & Flower’s crunchy, chewy wood-fired crust could hold its own against any specialty pizza shop in the city. Overall, it’s hard to miss on a menu like the one at Faith & Flower, where the potential combination of dishes, flavor profiles and experiences is mind-bending.
To help navigate these options is the helpful wait staff. Though they shy away from making outright unqualified recommendations, they are capable and knowledgeable. Food service is controlled back of house, where Hung and his staff determine the best possible pairing of the dishes ordered and bring the dishes out in an order that best complements flavors. Other facets of service can be a bit more workmanlike than necessary — one night, a member of the waitstaff whirls around refilling water with such vigor that water splashes out of the cup back onto the table.
Small misgivings notwithstanding, Faith & Flower seems to have situated comfortably into what it is: one of the largest, most intriguing restaurants in a city that seems to be clamoring for a culinary identity. It is at once nostalgic and disruptively progressive, smart and unpretentious, with a fondness for the well-crafted drink and an appreciation for multiple culinary cultures bouncing off one another, with each finding a way to make the other better. So replacing a $4 million restaurant that could very well become a representative of the city’s food scene is a daunting task — but in Los Angeles, maybe all it really takes is a little faith.

What good is a Batman show where Bruce Wayne never dons the cape and cowl?
That’s the question fans have been asking since Gotham, the new series premiering tonight on Fox, was first announced last year. The long-gestating brainchild of showrunner Bruno Heller, the creative force behind HBO’s sumptuous but short-lived period epic Rome and the bland but popular CBS drama The Mentalist, Gotham is set roughly a decade before Master Bruce takes up the mantle of the Bat, meaning the majority of the franchise’s most iconic characters — the Joker, Catwoman, the Riddler, the Penguin — are either obscure up-and-comers or completely absent from the story (Robin isn’t even a hatchling at this point).

Mining the single most recognizable setting in the DC universe might seem like a roadmap to ratings gold, but Heller’s series is actually a calculated risk for Fox, who committed to 16 episodes and an exclusive subscription deal with Netflix before the pilot’s debut. The last live-action Batman series to suffer from a distinct lack of Batman was 2002’s Birds of Prey, a superhero gloss on Buffy the Vampire Slayer that was famously cancelled after only 13 episodes. So why does Gotham seem destined to succeed where previous attempts have shriveled up faster than a Venom-deprived Bane? Two words: James Gordon.
That’s right, the focus of the show is trained squarely on fan-favorite Detective Gordon (Ben McKenzie), the fresh-faced Gotham City transplant who will eventually ascend to the rank of commissioner, cutting through a morass of corruption to emerge as one of Batman’s staunchest allies in his never-ending war on crime. The first episode opens with Gordon arriving in Gotham and locking horns with his new partner Harvey Bullock (Donal Logue), a cynical, slovenly veteran who appears just a few shades shy of being dirty. The first few minutes are worryingly heavy with hackneyed procedural dialogue, but the narrative stabilizes as the two men slowly develop a grudging respect for each other.
Despite Bullock’s protests, the pair’s first case together ends up being the murder of Thomas and Martha Wayne, which leads to Gordon’s first encounter with the newly orphaned Bruce (David Mazouz, best known for playing Kiefer Sutherland’s autistic son in Touch), emotionally excoriated by the loss of his parents, and his faithful butler Alfred (Sean Pertwee, swapping the standard prim-and-proper elocution for a full-throated Cockney drawl). After vowing to bring the killer to justice for the sake of the boy’s soul, Gordon quickly finds himself caught in a battle of wits with the glamorous but deadly crime lord Fish Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) and her simpering manservant, a hook-nosed, umbrella-wielding cretin by the name of Oswald Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor).
As evidence of a devilish conspiracy against the Wayne family steadily mounts, a cavalcade of future rogues scuttles from the shadows, including obsessive puzzler Edward Nygma (Cory Michael Smith), prepubescent cat burglar Selina Kyle (Camren Bicondova), budding horticulturist Ivy Pepper (Clare Foley) and a nameless standup comedian who is persuaded to stop taking life so seriously.
The Gordon character, previously inhabited by the likes of Gary Oldman and the voice of Bryan Cranston, is a surprisingly meaty role, the battered moral compass of the Batman mythos, and McKenzie tears into it with dogged determination. The actor, already known for portraying a conflicted cop in TNT’s crime drama Southland, might be in danger of repeating himself here, but he acquits himself admirably by playing Gordon not as some Serpico-style martyr but rather as a flawed, noble man with superhuman reserves of kindness and decency. It’s suddenly easy to remember why Frank Miller insisted on putting Gordon front and center in Batman Year One, the acclaimed graphic novel where the future Commissioner is revealed to be every bit the hero Batman is, if not more so.
Of course, it wouldn’t be a Batman show without a few quality villains. Taylor is definitely the early standout here. His Cobblepot is a real piece of work: a scheming sadist who’s grown adept at using ingratiation and flattery to conceal his grandiose ambitions. His scenes with Pinkett Smith are over-the-top but far too diabolical to qualify as Adam West-era camp, especially when the treacherous twosome begins plotting against Carmine Falcone (John Doman), the boss of all bosses in Gotham City.
Nearly every scene in the pilot is injected with a sense of heightened reality, an atmosphere that blends Tim Burton’s Gothic playhouse aesthetic with the more grounded neo-noir sensibilities of Christopher Nolan. This is the most fully realized version of Gotham City fans are likely to see outside of Batman: The Animated Series and the Arkham City games. It will be interesting to see if future episodes with more modest budgets are able to recapture this unique look and feel.
Unlike ABC’s wildly inconsistent Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gotham works partly because it’s not beholden to a larger cinematic universe. This version of Batman’s origin exists completely outside any other official continuity, including the Nolan trilogy and Zack Snyder’s upcoming Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. That means these characters and their adventures will be allowed to unfold organically, without the need for endless tie-ins and crossover events (there’s been no indication thus far that Gotham exists in the same world as CW’s Arrow or next month’s The Flash, although that could change moving forward).
The long-term success of Gotham will largely depend on how the writers handle the Bruce Wayne character. Will the spotlight remain on Gordon and his efforts to root out corruption in the GCPD, or will Heller and his team take the Smallville route and show young Bruce actively pursuing his destiny? Mazouz is a gifted young actor, but it would be a mistake to simply remake Batman Begins on the small screen for the teenybopper crowd. If viewer or studio pressure ends up getting the better of them, however, they would do well to remember this fundamental truth about the character, something many creative minds have forgotten at their own peril: Bruce Wayne died with his parents. What survived became Batman.

The Internet has brought fame to an unlikely breed: the cat. From cats that jump in and out of boxes, to those who seem incapable of happiness, the celebrity cat, or celebri-cat, is one of the most strangely appealing online figures. And there’s one in particular who’s unlike any other.
Lil BUB has been featured in an award-winning documentary, has her own web series and is a published author. Remember, she’s a feline. Her small shape and tiny legs make her look like a permanent kitten, but her most prominent features are a pair of bulging eyes and a small pink tongue that remains perpetually sticking out. She’s easily one of the most unusual-looking celebri-cats, but that’s why her fans adore her.
BUB and her “Dude,” owner Mike Bridavsky, traveled from Indiana to Los Angeles to co-host the Feline Film Festival in Exposition Park on Sunday. A true celebration of the new age of the cat, the festival featured an 80-foot screen projecting the web’s top cat videos and short films. But first, Lil BUB stopped by Adopt & Shop, the festival’s principle sponsor, to the delight of 60 fanatics.
The meet-and-greet allowed fans in Culver City to meet the friendly feline and snap a photo and pet her, after they purchased a $50 ticket. Aside from her quirky cuteness, Lil BUB is a bit of a philanthropist and has raised nearly $200,000 for animals in need. Bridavksy said his cat had been raising money for almost two-and-a-half years by making t-shirts for fun before she was really famous. Now, it’s a completely different enterprise.
“It’s a full-time job now,” Bridavsky said. “It’s been going on for two-and-a-half years so we’re actually pretty used to it, but I think it’s a lot more work than people realize.”
Bridavsky manages everything himself — lucky for him, BUB loves traveling and the attention — but  it’s  important      to  acknowledge that all this is business and at the end of the day, Lil BUB is just his pet.
“She’s my cat,” he said. “And I’m just a guy. It’s amusing and you get to meet interesting people and do neat projects, so it is a pretty cool job to have, and I get to spend it with my cat.”
But being a celebrity cat isn’t for every pet. Bridavsky fully credits Lil BUB for making it big, adding that he’s just helped her along the way. As he puts it, he has four other amazing cats who shouldn’t be and don’t want to be famous. BUB, he said, is a special case.
“I think it’s very rare, obviously, to find a pet that is destined for stardom and BUB is definitely that cat,” Bridavsky said. “She loves to meet people, she loves to go places and she’s totally calm. That’s just the way she is.”
It hasn’t always been easy for BUB, who was born the runt of her litter, with several genetic mutations that have made life more difficult for her. Her teeth never grew in and her lower jaw is shorter, which explains why her tongue is always sticking out. She has extra toes on each of her paws, including her hind legs, and she’s only four pounds — very, very small for an adult cat.
“She’s not really a cat, honestly,” Bridavsky said.
The biggest hurdle for BUB is a bone condition called osteopetrosis, which means that her bones get bigger and more deformed the older she gets. A year and a half ago, BUB could hardly walk or move at all, as her short legs restricted her movement. But Bridavsky found treatment for her and in the time since, BUB has regained her ability to run and jump, things that specialists never thought she’d be able to do again.
Back at Adopt & Shop, BUB snacked on a late lunch before greeting her fans, eating noisily on top of a pink blanket embroidered with her name. It was one of many gifts that Bridavsky has received on her behalf over the last three years. He’s also received email addresses from female fans, $300 in cash, a lot of fan art and has even seen 15 tattoos featuring his pet.
“Honestly it’s all kind of heartwarming and touching because it’s all for a special cat,” Bridavsky said. “The tattoos are pretty cool, but hopefully there’s not one of me.”
Lil BUB greeted nearly 60 fans, posing for photographs with squealing fans fawning over her soft fur and silly face. Several donned their BUB merchandise or other shirts that indicated their cat fanaticism. BUB offered autographed pictures with personalized inspirational messages to each attendee.
The event ended in many happy faces, a few adopted cats and a hushed excitement. Said one woman in a green BUB shirt happily clutching her signed picture, “I’m definitely framing this.”
 
Great synopsis of the wonder that is Lil Bub

In the video above, USC students were asked on Thursday about the upcoming gubernatorial race between Democratic incumbent mayor Jerry Brown and Republican challenger Neel Kashkari. In a recent poll by the Los Angeles Times and the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, results revealed a high amount of political support for Brown while many were unable to identify Kashkari. 
With an approval rating currently standing at 58 percent and leading by 21 points among likely voters, Brown holds a strong lead over his Republican challenger, according to the Point argument in last week’s Point/Counterpoint. However despite the odds against Kashkari, the public shouldn’t be too quick to dismiss him as nothing but an underdog, argues the Counterpoint.
The California gubernational election will take place on Nov. 4, 2014.

For the film connoisseur, the four seasons might as well be renamed Sundance, Venice, Cannes and Toronto. Each is a huge celebration highlighting new cinematic works, while recognizing the old and influential. It’s a year-long chase that eventually leads to the epitome of excellence in film, the Oscars. Yet, the Academy Awards, or any critically lauded film event for that matter, would not receive as much traction if it weren’t for film festivals.
Recently though, coming off of the closing nights of the Toronto International Film Festival, some film critics from the Huffington Post and Time have questioned the relevance of film festivals. They attribute these cinematic presentations to massive networking events rather than a platform to purely showcase films. They mention competition with streaming giants such as Netflix, claiming that creative content stemming from films is now outdated and, quite simply, as Elliott Grove put it in the Huffington Post, that film festivals are a place where people in the industry just attend to feel “special.”
These are mere appropriations of the meaning of film festivals. In actuality, with our rapidly evolving and highly connected society, film festivals are the best platforms to promote quality movies. That’s why TIFF, or wherever filmmakers converge and network, is such a hub for inspiration. Film festivals take place in international locations across the world throughout the year, leading people to go to new places and see works from new perspective. Ultimately, films with broader viewpoints gained from various cultural environments are generated, leading them to speak to a wider range of audiences. It contributes to the goal film festivals want to achieve — to celebrate the art of cinema.
Film is a medium that predates the majority of modern entertainment such as Netflix, Hulu and YouTube. Though Internet outlets have become more accessible in the digital age, the environment of a theater and the way a story is told through movies allows for transportation into a world that a laptop or even a television screen can’t offer. This notion that cinema is an organic art form separate from the binge-watching, self-uploading video culture that dominates today is heralded at film festivals. They also prove that people do care about movies and will even venture out to collaborate with other movie lovers as well. According to TIFF’s official website, during the organization’s first festival in 1976, there were only 35,000 attendees. Meanwhile, last year, close to half a million people lined up to see various films in the Toronto circuit.
All the people waiting to see a specific movie don’t necessarily contribute to this big-headed mentality critics claim film festivals seem to have. It’s a given that when the lights dim in a theater, there will be a reverent and respectful — not pretentious –— hush, and people will immerse themselves into a story. If the movie captivates the audience, there will probably be a standing ovation. The audience, as a group of consumers, is part of the process of realizing the good in movies. It’s not always about the action-packed CGI sequences; it’s also about capturing the nuances of everyday life, moments more likely to be shown at a film festival. Sometimes following a showing, there will be a question and answer panel, which also doesn’t serve to put people in the entertainment industry on a pedestal. Instead, it allows the viewers of a specific movie to understand more about the art form.
Festivals encourage people to view more films and examine stories in another form. Instead of criticizing an event or this form of artistic expression, there should be encouragement for people to watch quality, groundbreaking movies. Like reading an immersive book or listening to a poignant song, movies also deserve to be a commonality and not merely discarded as entertainment. Film festivals do just that.

In the wee hours of a late summer morning, the United Kingdom heard the words every country wants to hear when it gets down on one referendum — “No.” Thursday marked a historic vote in Scotland on whether to secede from a 307-year marriage with Britain. As the results came out, pro-unionists in Scotland and across the United Kingdom let out a sigh of relief. Scotland’s first minister and Nationalist leader Alex Salmond conceded defeat but vowed to keep the nationalist spirit alive and capitalize on the promises made by U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron that the latter will give Scotland more powers and autonomy in government. The vote might have failed, but the newfound hope for independence lives on.
Deena Baum | Daily Trojan
 
In a last-ditch effort to prevent secession, Cameron promised sweeping reforms for Scotland, promising legislation just shy of independence itself. Economics had been the reason many viewed independence as a viable option. Scotland possesses vast oil reserves that serve as strategic military bases for the region. With tourism, whiskey and banking industries as well, few doubted Scotland wouldn’t survive as an independent nation. With that dream on the backburner for now, the vibrant country should look to gain some concessions from the United Kingdom and build on its autonomy.
A vote for secession would have been embarrassing for Cameron and the United Kingdom as a whole, but with that now in the past, the prime minister must look to deliver on promises or risk uproar from the Scots. During the campaign, Scots demanded autonomy essentially on everything other than national security and financial policy.
Yet, giving Scotland so much autonomy in domestic affairs could be a slippery slope for Britain. Other members of the United Kingdom — England, Wales and Northern Ireland — might demand concessions as well in order to obtain more autonomy in constituent affairs. To prevent that from happening Cameron must make good on the promises he made, being careful enough to give something to the Scots while also maintaining the integrity of the office and state.
Even with the referendum defeated, the Scottish Parliament has seen an extreme boost in morale and confidence. With leverage in negotiations and the full backing of its people, the legislative body will now look to have greater autonomy and turn the other cheek when it comes to taking orders from London.
Even with promise of more autonomy, Scotland might look to vote on independence again in the future. Salmond was universally praised for his efforts in the campaign. He galvanized support across Scotland and garnered strong investments that boosted momentum and almost won the referendum, prompting opinion polls to indicate a victory. Salmond resigned after the results were released, but the spirit of his desire for independence is in full swing. The referendum was the largest turnout in Scotland’s history. Approximately 85 percent of eligible voters turned out, with a majority of people under the age of 55 voting to become independent. That translates to a future where autonomy is desired by a majority of Scots.
The next few months will be telling of the stability and future of the United Kingdom. If Cameron fails to engage in serious talks with the Scottish Parliament to grant more room for self-governing, it will further antagonize young voters and increase their desire to move away from an increasingly out-of-touch Westminster. If more self-governing powers are granted, it will set precedents for England, Wales and Northern Ireland to follow suit. Some have declared it is time for the United Kingdom to adopt a more federalist structure to its government, a move that would certainly curry the favor of Scots and anti-unionists alike. Independence fever might break out in the United Kingdom, and it will be interesting to see how the multitude of dynamics and their interplay affect not only the domestic affairs of the United Kingdom, but also its standing in the world.
This referendum might have failed, but the valiant efforts and struggle to gain independence lives on in the hearts of millions of Scots.

One of the biggest discussions in college football is how do the power five conferences—the ACC, SEC, Big Ten, Pac-12 and Big 12 rank. There is not much dispute as to who the best conference is top to bottom—the SEC. The SEC, who had won seven straight national championships before Florida State won it last year, has become a measure of how good college football teams really are.
There is no debate that the teams that have had success in the SEC — Alabama, Auburn, LSU — are at the top of the food chain, and it is widely agreed that the Big Ten is a struggling conference with many mediocre teams partly based on their performance against the SEC in bowl games the past decade or so. Furthermore, most people believe the Big 12 Conference is strong seeing as Missouri and Texas A&M came from the Big 12 to the SEC and immediately began contending for conference titles. Texas A&M was a top ten team their first year in the conference featuring a big win at No. 1 Alabama, and Missouri won the SEC East their second year in the conference. But what about the Pac-12?
Although the argument itself over who the best conference is difficult to make, it is especially difficult to measure where the Pac-12 stands. They rarely go head-to-head against the SEC. There are no bowls that pitt the two conferences against each other. The last time they did was in the intense 2011 BCS National Championship that resulted in a close 22-19 win for Auburn over Oregon. Fortunately for college football fans, the new four-team playoff will encourage more head-to-head Pac-12 vs. SEC matchups. For example, USC is set to play Alabama in the 2016 Cowboys Classic.
Another way one could try to determine how the Pac-12 fares in college football is by looking at it’s bowl record the past few years, but it really does not make the picture any clearer. In general it is difficult to discern a whole conference’s strength based on it’s teams performances in bowl games. Weaker teams in a conference may play well while the stronger ones may struggle and vice versa.
In addition, the games are not always equally; often times a relatively strong team from one conference will play a relatively weak one from another conference. Nonetheless, it is really one of the only ways to compare the conferences. Last year, (the 2013-2014 season) the Pac-12 finished 6-3, but it’s two division champions, Arizona State and Stanford, both lost their bowl games, including a Rose Bowl loss for Pac-12 champions Stanford.
In the 2012-2013 season, although the Pac-12 won its BCS bowl games (Oregon won the Fiesta Bowl and Stanford won the Rose Bowl), the conference was 2-4 in its other bowl games. During the 2011-2012 bowl season, the conference went 2-5. Looking at the big picture it would seem that the conference is on an upward trend toward the top of college football the past three years, but the performing of the better teams of the conference in the big games seem to contradict that.
So, if we were to rate the power five conferences from strongest to weakest, where would the Pac-12 be? One could make a strong case that the Pac-12 is better than the Big Ten right now, since the Big Ten seems to struggle every bowl season, and because the Big Ten powerhouses are all suffering from early season losses, including Michigan State who lost to Oregon.
Many analysts thought that game featured the Pac-12’s best against the Big Ten’s best, and Oregon came away with a 47-26 win. The Pac-12 vs. Big 12, ACC, and SEC arguments are more difficult to make. Last bowl season, the Pac-12 went 2-0 against the ACC with a combined 52 point win margin between the two games, but the ACC is on the rise after it overthrew the SEC with a national championship last year and has had some big nonconference showings and wins to begin this year including a win for what many believed would be a mediocre Boston College team against a top ten Pac-12 opponent in USC.
The Pac-12 vs. Big 12 argument is equally as confusing looking at their bowl records against one another. Last year in bowl games the Pac-12 was 1-1 against the Big 12. The year before the Pac-12 went 1-2 against the Big 12, but the one win for the Pac-12 was a match between the two conference champions, Oregon and Kansas State; Oregon won fairly handily 35-17. Most likely, the conference is better than the Big Ten, not quite as strong as the SEC, but somewhere in between with the ACC and Big 12. Hopefully, the arrival of the four-team playoff will help clear the conference debate up for college football fans.

So as many John Green followers already know, Variety announced that model Cara Delevingne has been cast as the lead role of Margo Roth Spiegelman in the film adaptation of Paper Towns, Green’s third insanely successful young adult novel. Paper Towns is about two estranged childhood friends, Quentin and Margo, who reunite for a night of debauchery when Margo, dressed as a ninja, creeps into Quentin’s room and insists he come with her to enact vengeance against those who’ve hurt her. The next morning, she’s disappeared: and Quentin, driven by his infatuation with his mysterious neighbor, sets off to track her down.
If you’ve been following Delevingne’s career, this casting choice is probably no surprise: she’s the talk of the modeling world, the newest “it girl”, and has recently begun nabbing acting roles. There’s no denying these John Green adaptations are – let’s put it gently – lucrative: so far The Fault in Our Stars has garnered an exorbitant $300 million worldwide. Considering the massive money attached to these teen blockbusters, it’s no wonder they’d want to attach one of the hottest names in the entertainment industry to the film – but the casting choice has so far proved a bit controversial. So what are the pros and cons of the Cara Delevingne casting choice, beginning with the not-so-positive?
 
Cons:
She’s inexperienced: She’s acted before, but most of her projects (Pan, Tulip Fever) have yet to be released! Basically, no one actually knows whether she’s as capable in front of the camera as she is on the runway.
She doesn’t fit the character physically: It has to be addressed that the character of Margo was described explicitly as curvy – and model Delevingne certainly doesn’t fulfill that qualification. Fans who were hoping for a beautiful and bigger protagonist in the adaptation have every right to be disappointed, and Hollywood is once again demonstrating that it’s not exactly a haven of body acceptance. But hey, in the end, having the part be well acted is the most important thing!
She’s British: This isn’t a bad thing! But Emma Watson has been perfecting her American accent since she was a child, and she still got mocked for slipping up in The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Delevingne is set to portray a teenager from the suburbs of Orlando, Florida – it doesn’t get much more American than that.
 
Pros:
She’s so cool: There’s a reason Delevingne is “all that” right now – beyond being gorgeous, she’s generally the coolest person ever. She’s a drummer, she’s openly dated Michelle Rodriguez, she makes goofy faces hot, and she’s got the strongest eyebrow game in the modeling industry. She gives off the “I don’t care what you think vibe” better than any other model today – and that’s saying something.
John Green has complete faith in her: The author has posted on multiple social media sites about the decision so far, promising on Tumblr that, “Like everyone involved in the film, I was blown away by her audition. She really, really, really gets Margo”. Considering Margo is Green’s character, we have to have faith he knew what to look for in the auditions better than any fan would!
Let’s not miss the point of the book itself: At its core, Paper Towns is about not assuming things. It’s about a kid who realizes that he’s infatuated with the idea of a girl, not the girl herself. That’s the point of the book: that you can’t project a fantasy onto a real person. So let’s not be too critical of this choice – after all, questioning the casting choice is letting preconceived notions of Delevingne – as a model and larger than life personality – cloud our perceptions before they’ve even started filming.
 
Point is, there’s now a Margo Roth Spiegelman and a Quentin Jacobson (Nat Wolff of Nickelodeon and Fault in Our Stars fame), and the movie is happening. That in itself should be enough to put a smile on any Paper Towns fan’s face!
At least until Looking for Alaska’s cast list inevitably comes out, and we do this all over again.

Week one leaves fantasy owners with the wrong mindset heading forward into the season. They are either prematurely crowning themselves champion of the league after an early win or scrambling to make any kind of trade to shake up their roster and not feel the pain of defeat again in week two.
Both parties need to stop. Fantasy Football is a cruel game full of ups and downs on a week-to-week basis that send owners on an emotional roller coaster. Even if your stud player didn’t perform to your standards just relax and wait it out.
However, if you can’t stand your team’s week one performance and are looking to make a major splash by adding someone on the waiver wire or making a trade it’s understandable. CHOOSE WISELY.
 
Studs
Kelvin Benjamin, WR, Carolina Panthers
This rookie wide receiver is 6’5” 243 pounds of pure monster. While with any rookie there are bound to be some learning curves, Benjamin didn’t show any problems against the Buccaneers as he carved their defense up for ninety-three yards and a touchdown. Look for Benjamin to continue this type of performance throughout the course of the season because lets face it who else is Cam Newton going to throw to after losing their top four receivers from last season.
 
Carlos Hyde, RB, San Francisco 49ers
Yes, Hyde is also a rookie. While most owners do not like rookies because they are risky and sometimes inconsistent, they do also provide the highest upside. Plain and simple there isn’t a rookie running back with more upside than Hyde. While he is currently blocked for playing time by Frank Gore, Hyde will see limited carries and could provide help in deeper leagues. However, everyone needs to be aware of him and try to stash him on their bench because if Gore goes down with an injury Carlos Hyde immediately steps into the conversation of being a top ten fantasy running back.
 
Zach Ertz, TE, Philadelphia Eagles
While I was going to go another rookie in Brandin Cooks (Future Star) I decided to switch it up and go with the second year TE out of Stanford (Fight On). Chip Kelly, the coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, already said that Ertz will play a larger role in their offense this year and boy did he mean it. Ertz in week one caught three balls for seventy-seven yards and a touchdown. Expect more performances like this from Ertz, as he should be looked at as a serious weapon in the redzone for the Eagles.
 
Duds
Allen Hurns, WR, Jacksonville Jaguars
Hey look, Hurns is a rookie and I don’t like him for fantasy! While he did have an extremely impressive week one, if it wasn’t for wide receiver Cecil Shorts being out he never would have produced numbers close to that. I expect Hurns to receive fewer reps when Cecil gets back from his injury and return to fantasy irrelevance. Do not waste your time picking him up or trading for him because he, like Kevin Ogletree who had a huge first game in 2012 and then proceeded to do nothing the rest of the season, is an absolute fluke.
 
Cordarrelle Patterson, WR, Minnesota Vikings
Honestly this pick could end up being completely moronic by the end of the season. With that being said the hype around this guy is absolutely ridiculous. SURE he had a big week one, but if it wasn’t for his sixty-seven yard fluke of a touchdown he only had a pathetic twenty-three yards receiving. To make matters worse he doesn’t have a good quarterback throwing to him because Matt Cassel, Teddy Bridgewater, and Christian Ponder combined wouldn’t amount to a top twenty quarterback in the NFL. Be skeptical of his hype and don’t rely on him too much as a WR1 or WR2. Sell high on him if you can and try and get a more proven WR.

You can either laugh or cry, but New York Fashion Week has finally come to an end. Although this action-packed week merely lasted eight days, fashion week once again proved that it is an all-embracing, global event that instantly impels people to pause whatever they are doing in their lives and give full attention to. New York Fashion Week promptly became the talk of the town, flooding the newsfeed of countless tweets, posts, and Instagrams.
With so many shows, designers, trends, and not to mention the A-listers sitting front row to scrutinize on, it’s easy to miss what really happened at New York Fashion Week. Many fashion insiders got a peek at what styles are transpiring for Spring 2015 at NYFW, and to ensure that you don’t miss out on the upcoming trends, here are the highlights of NYFW.
For one thing, many of the designers played with avant-garde in a very subtle way with the reexamination of the classic periods. Motivated by the timeless styles, figures, and hues from the past, big name designers showcased experimental yet time-honored collections that are not only aesthetically appropriate on catwalks but also on the streets of New York City.
 
Picturesque in Pastel
For Spring 2015, just as Spring 2014, the designers fiddled with soft, creamy pastel palette, such as pasty pink, faint blue, and ashy lilac. However, to bring new energy into the collections, the brand designers incorporated the pale pastels with surprise pop of colors, including sunshine yellow and illuminating tangerine. Furthermore, to make the palette more wearable on the streets and to don a more modern take, the brand designers also added subdued hues, such as dusky granite and tinted metallic to balance out the wide range of vibrant, pale colors. So, if you have any pastels in your closet from last spring, make sure to keep them because they will definitely be wardrobe staples for the foreseeable spring.
 
Salute to Nature
Can you get more “spring” than the sprinkles of floral patterns?  For Spring 2015, the designers proved that exquisite styles could arise from simple, mundane matters, such as Mother Nature. In preparation for the spring season where new flowers and liveliness blossom, designers unveiled graceful floral prints mixed with lavish foliage prints that contrasted so elegantly on dark fabrics. Although the designers played with femininity and delicacy, emanated from the botanical patterns, they surely dabbled with the idea of androgyny as well with the shadowy, darkened variations of background colors. You may have pointed and laughed at Hawaiian flannel shirts before, but soon enough, you will see floral prints on front pages of top street style blogs.
 
Classy in White
This may come as a shock, but you can surely have great style without the burden of its overbearing cost. In this year’s NYFW, the big name designers displayed a new trend that you might already have in your closet. If you don’t, you will certainly find one in your boyfriend or dad’s closet.  Go steal one, right now. The white button-down shirts and flannels were exhibited up and down the runways, demonstrating both feminine and masculine styles as well as useful layering tricks. By fusing timeless, classy white button-down shirts with exuberant pastel colored shorts, radiantly hued skirts, or dimmed, structured pants, the designers enlivened such simple design and developed it into an elegant, tasteful style in every angle. This year’s NYFW upheld the white button-down shirts as one of the most accessible and affordable trends to follow for the approaching spring.
 
A is for Androgyny
When people think of spring, especially in terms of fashion, most tend to envision flowers, pastels, and anything else that embodies girlishness. Even before Miley Cyrus shocked the world with her impulsive boy cut, the 21st century fashion world has been consistently interested in the masculine-meet-feminine style. Boyish, baggy fit was definitely prominent in this year’s NYFW runways, toning down the overly feminine styles suited for spring. Yet, in order to further praise the beauty of woman silhouettes, the designers integrated over-sized masculine clothes with soft, effeminate pieces. Talking about androgyny, the designers left out the expected stilettos for casual sneakers and easy-going sandals, making the collections more appropriate for street styles. So, in relations to being androgynous (if you’re into it, go for it, please), this year’s NYFW underscored the phrase, “Less is more.” So ladies, sometimes it’s more beautiful to be dressed down, so don’t be afraid to kick in some sneakers with your dresses.
These are some of the highlights from New York Fashion Week, encasing Spring 2015 collections. If you want more detailed information about this year’s NYFW, definitely check out the very innovative and fun play executed by Opening Ceremony. Now that’s a way to showcase a new collection. The renowned designer, Ralph Lauren also revealed a groundbreaking show with a 4D-runway, using water-screen projections.
All in all, this year’s NYFW ascertained the perpetually evolving and flourishing fashion taste, bringing the world together as it fused art, history, and fashion together, demonstrating a beautiful and profound spectacle.

Succeeding the streak of positive reviews from his previous work, The Guard, Calvary is John Michael McDonagh’s second directorial triumph. A low budget Irish independent film played by strong actors such as Brendan Gleeson, Chris O’Dowd, and Domhall Gleeson, the movie is about a priest who is constantly challenged about the validity of faith, righteousness of the church, and absolution of sins. The title can be quite misleading, but the story is not nearly as didactic or overly religious as it may sound. In fact, the narrative treats Christianity as a mere setting for the plots to be driven by, and the story does not put down or impose the religion. Through the use of this element, however, it seems that the attempt of the filmmakers is to provoke the viewers to question the capacity of forgiveness and the fickleness of human nature.
The movie begins with a shot of Father James, played by Brendan Gleeson, listening to a confession of a man out of the frame. The man tells him about how he was raped by a priest as a child and that the rapist had died. After explaining to Father James that there is no point in a bad priest dying since it would not be shocking, the man announces that he will shoot Father James at a local beach in a week because he is a good priest who has done nothing wrong. The story spans over a week as the priest visits other members of the congregation who have made disturbing confessions to help them with their problematic lives, and the audience soon learns that Father James himself does not have a perfect life; he is a judgmental alcoholic and a father of a suicidal daughter.
As grim as the subject matter of the film is, Calvary has surprisingly funny moments. McDonagh sprinkled over a decent amount of dry humor throughout the film, which can easily catch the audience off guard. By drawing back the attention of the viewers that might have slightly drifted away by the slow pace of the film—which one can argue completely justifiable as this reflects the overall bleak atmosphere of the town and the priest’s emotional state as he makes effort to stay calm while his death day approaches—such wry wits heighten the sense of disgust, awe, and sympathy at the pinnacle of the story. Calvary really takes the time to progress in the plot line allowing the characters to fully develop and the themes to completely steep into the viewers’ minds, but this also means that not everyone is going to come out of the theater feeling satisfied. It does not cater to those who seek for suspenseful actions and dynamic entertainment, although it can get quite intense towards the end.
Nevertheless, with its breathtaking cinematography, Calvary would definitely captivate any cinephiles who appreciate the visual aesthetics of a film. The ample use of one-point perspective wide-angle shots is rather reminiscent of Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel, and the muted color palette suggests a resemblance to Tom Hooper’s The King’s Speech. Dabbled bits of drab red on top of the overall musky green tone, the soft juxtaposition of the contrasting shades in the frames are eye catching yet comfortable to look at. As if that isn’t enough, the sparing amount of aerial shots of the scenic landscape of Ireland accompanied by delicate melancholy scores make it difficult for anyone to look away.
The silences that do not cease to be graceful thanks to Brendan Gleeson’s contemplative facial expressions well flaunt his capability as an actor. His lines are often comparatively terse, but his lack of words is filled by his strong performance. Whether Gleeson mutters for a short duration or roars with anger, his emotions are successfully conveyed.
With a thought-provoking script, charming visuals, and solid actors, Calvary is a notable film for its humble budget, especially considering that it is McDonagh’s second feature length work as a director. The film may seem like it falters at times due to the particularly gradual pace, and the superfluous understatements can be slightly overwhelming at times.Nonetheless, if you enjoy good-looking independent dramas with a stoic ambience, or if you simply want to be entertained by a drunk widowed swearing judgmental priest who was never really there for his suicidal daughter, Calvary is a movie to watch while it is still in theaters.
