In light of recent years where rampant fires turned the West Coast’s skies into a “Blade Runner 2049” blood orange hue, tens of thousands of people dying in Delhi due to preventable air pollution, Texas frozen in place and communities in Southeast Asia facing the threat of extinction from rising sea levels and storm surges, it is naive to separate one’s own participation from the events that have decimated the Earth to a point of no return.
Whether it be reducing emissions, pollution or waste from home life, your career endeavors or elsewhere, some companies are inching toward the realization that sustainability in its most basic and buzzword-y terms is very lucrative, but not so much for the environment. 
Surfing, encompassing more of a lifestyle than most other sports and activities out there, is pushing its endorsers and suppliers to take the lead in areas of ocean conservation and the reduction of emissions from the garment industry. But the impact surfing has on global anthropogenic CO2 and energy use far exceeds these broad categories. 
In 2009, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the textile and leather industry consumed 2.15 exajoules of energy across the world, most of it powered by coal and electricity. If you’re curious or don’t understand energy units like me, one exajoule is 1018 joules, and the earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan in 2011 off the coast of Thoku had about 1.41 EJ behind it.
After the fast fashion boom out of the UK from 2000-2005, clothing consumption increased to the buying of about a third more garments per year, per person. The advent of “sustainable” fashion has pushed people to buy more clothing, not out of need, but out of interest. In 2018, according to data from the “Fashion on Climate” report, the garment and footwear industry created more greenhouse gas than the countries of France, Germany and the UK combined.
Tourism, a particularly difficult sector for international climate change agencies to balance, is projected at what is called a “business-as-usual” scenario (no significant mitigation techniques) to increase its emissions by 130% up until 2035, with that from flights and accommodations tripling. Travellers who frequent long-distance journeys to — I don’t know — surfing hot spots such as San Clemente to Bali, contribute most to these emissions. 
Am I saying every single person in the world is a surfer or that surfers are the reason for accelerated climate change? Average reading comprehension would say no. But it’s important to note the different players that provide what you need for surfing, or any other activity, and how they interact with the ocean and greater climate.
Consider the tool of the trade — surfboards. Indigenous peoples of Hawaii and Polynesia have been and are arguably the most environmentally conscious surfers out there, beginning on heavy boards made out of trees. Since then, most surfboards have been made out of a few different yet similarly toxic materials: blanks made with petroleum-based polyurethane sealed with carcinogenic polyester resin to boards starting from expanded polystyrene (Styrofoam). While the average surfer’s quiver is sure to last decently long, a professional surfer can go through one of these boards almost every week. 
The GOAT of surfing, 11-time world champion Kelly Slater, made a more meaningful statement on the subject when he won the 2015 Rip Curl Pro event in Bells Beach on an Ecoboard. The board has a certification from the nonprofit Sustainable Surf that verifies the board has one of the following: “a measurably reduced carbon footprint, renewable, recycled and/or up-cycled material inputs,” or “uses materials and processes that reduce toxicity during manufacturing.”
However, attempts to make surfboards almost completely sustainable, including one made out of an invasive species of seaweed in the British Isles, have not proved successful in making low-volume and strongly constructed boards. 
The GOAT of surfboard shaping, to some, San Clemente’s Matt Biolos, is skeptical of the reception of these boards, which is understandable coming from the owner of Lost Entreprises, which boasts over 30 former champions, current world tour trotters and up-and-comers on its brand team. 
“Surfers are not going to sacrifice the performance of a light board for being green,” Biolos told the New York Times in 2009. 
Yes, that quote is older than some of the current surfers on Lost’s team, but it still speaks to an important choice. During that time, Southern California was putting out around 800 boards a day, with 40% of the blanks they were coming from going to landfills. With around 13-24 million surfboards sold globally in a year, who knows how many more from quarantine-inspired activity and the surfing equipment industry valued at $3.1 billion in 2018, it’s hard to overstate the impact that a once-daily activity for locals of Polynesia in the 4th century, since transformed and colonized by domineering global capitalism, has had on the environment. 
There are some good moves happening right now to address this issue: Apparel and footwear company Globe launched its Low Velocity program last year to “put environmental priorities and products of quality and longevity ahead of fast fashion sales of disposable items.” Biodegradable traction pads and buy-a-board-plant-a-tree sales are increasing. Labs like the Center for Surf Research are encouraging people to think of their passion for surfing in terms of a career and purpose. Some surfers are at the forefront of environmental activism and ocean conservation around the world. 
But in a world with maybe 36 million surfers, the individual shouldn’t have to be reminded that their contribution to helping the environment doesn’t start and end at the beach parking lot.

Darin Gray, the co-director of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering K-12 STEM Center, was recently named the James E. Ballinger Engineer of the Year 2020 by the Orange County Engineering Council  — an award which honors exceptional engineers renowned in their fields.
The OCEC honored Gray for his long-term work at the STEM Center and awarded him for his influence on disadvantaged students. For the last 25 years, Gray has been part of the STEM educational outreach and has helped many Black and Indigenous students, students of color and girls pursue STEM as a profession. Gray said his work aims to excite students about STEM and educate teachers about how to teach them.
“I’m just really appreciative, honored, that the OCEC thought enough of me and in terms of all the people who’ve won that award,” Gray said. “I’ve been to the ceremony back in the pre-COVID days, and the people who have won that award are some of the top people in the field, and to be included in that company — it was just such an honor.”
Gray said Viterbi Dean Yannis C. Yortsos’ motto, “changing the face of engineering,” is what he always strives for. He makes engineering fun by showing students what geometry and math coordinates can create. One example was when he taught kids about creating 3D computer-aided design for 3D printers. STEM kids love to have such activities, Gray said, but even drama students like it because they don’t have to build props by hand. 
“Attracting students to engineering is not an easy thing, particularly for students who are underrepresented and don’t have the means,” Yortsos said. “[Gray is] very persistent. Very understanding of the environment in which he works, [he’s] clearly an expert in that. Very passionate about making the connection between engineering and the underserved communities — in a way he is an ambassador of engineering to high school kids.”
The OCEC commemorates engineering work yearly at a gala event and honors the best engineers, scientists, educators and students. OCEC members can nominate a colleague or a friend through the OCEC Annual Awards Nomination form. In order to receive an award, OCEC sets high standards that require long-term achievements and the engineers to still be active in their fields.
Gray has both operational and program responsibilities at the STEM center. While in charge of diversity, equity and inclusion, Gray oversees a few STEM programs created to help elementary and high school students. He is responsible for the logistics of the center, such as budgeting, preparing youth compliance proposals and fundraising. During summers, Gray also teaches Discover Engineering at USC, which is a college class for high school students. 
Gray said he was always good in math and science, but his original plan in 10th grade was to become a doctor. Although placed in an advanced class at the time, Gray changed his medical direction after a girl he liked told him he should become an engineer. Gray said he didn’t know what an engineer was until then, and had to go to the library to find out.
“I just had a crush on her, and in my chemistry class I was the top student, even though there were a bunch of seniors there, I always outscored everybody else, and the fact that she thought I would be a good engineer was good enough for me,” Gray said.
While Gray’s crush led him to enroll in a summer engineering program in Detroit, his love for the field is what drove him above and beyond. Since then, Gray has received bachelor’s degrees in biomedical and electrical engineering and in math, and a master’s in teaching from USC. In 2018, Gray also received a doctorate in education technology from Boise State University.
Gray furthered his career by becoming a member of the California State Guard, where he teaches basic cyber coding. He is currently studying to receive a master’s degree in cyber security from California State University San Marcos and is set to graduate in May 2021.
Before becoming a teacher, Gray worked for the Hughes Aircraft Company. At the time, he also began volunteering and teaching computer skills to disadvantaged students at an alternative high school, where he also tutored them in the evenings in order to elevate their math knowledge. Gray said he soon realized there wasn’t a lot of focus on getting students interested in math, so he decided to step in and become a teacher. 
“I came from a similar neighborhood and it was school that helped me to change my life,” Gray said. “And so, I went to my boss at Hughes and I said I want to become a teacher. He didn’t believe me at first, he thought I was just playing. He said I don’t think so. So, I left to become a teacher.”
As Gray continued teaching, he took on the role of alternative education and work center outreach consultant at a different school in the Los Angeles Unified School District. For 20 years, he would spend mornings running the school — working on community outreach, teaching, hiring and budgeting.
In the afternoons, he would go to USC to run the after-school programs, such as the USC Viterbi Mission Science program, which helps elementary and middle school students gain STEM experience.
Gray’s former high school student from the Metropolitan Skills Center AEWC, Jecery Ninonuevo, said that both her and her daughter were able to graduate because of Gray’s program. Ninonuevo, who’s now a nursing home administrator, almost dropped out of school when she became pregnant at the age of 15. She said that Gray never abandoned his students and he would make sure they would all graduate. 
“I don’t think there’s any teachers out there who have the same empathy and compassion that he had for kids like me,” Ninonuevo said. “[Gray] would go above and beyond to make sure that you get those credits for high school graduation, like find ways to motivate you.”
Today, Gray continues to motivate students and focuses even more on improving diversity, equity and inclusion, because he said the pandemic is leaving kids of color and girls behind. When Gray worked in both private and public schools, he saw a big gap on what equipment kids had access to. Many students who don’t come from affluent areas either don’t have internet access or are unable to afford a laptop, and the coronavirus has increased that gap even more, Gray said. 
Gray’s goal over the next few years is to be able to deal with learning losses due to the coronavirus. The way Gray’s USC Viterbi K-12 STEM Center team is pursuing this goal now is by making sure that everything they do, from outreach to educational programs, emphasizes equity and is accessible to everyone.
“What Dean Yortsos talks about is ‘changing the face of engineering and making the world a better place,’ so we internalize that in everything that we do,” Gray said. “One of the ways you make the world a better place is by educating everybody. You empower everybody, how you change the face of engineering, how you change the face of STEM, by giving access.”

After almost a year-long coronavirus-induced hiatus, USC baseball opened its season this weekend with a 2-1 series win over LMU. The young squad’s solid pitching and defensive agility allowed the Trojans’ to pitch a shutout in game two of the series but ultimately wasn’t enough in Sunday’s 11-inning nail-biter.
During the series opener on Friday the Trojans experienced a rough start at bat with no hits and only two walks over the first five innings of the game. Meanwhile, on the mound, redshirt-junior pitcher Isaac Esqueda allowed a single and double in the first inning, leading to two runs for the Lions.
Redshirt freshman fielder Tyresse Turner broke the ice offensively for USC with a sixth inning home run to right field. Redshirt junior right fielder Jamal O’Guinn made it a tie game the next inning.
USC’s relief pitchers shut down LMU’s chances to respond in the final two innings, and LMU’s sophomore pitcher Alex Burge allowed a single in the ninth and a pair of subsequent walks that cemented the 3-2 walk-off victory for USC. USC converted exactly three hits to three runs by the end of the game.
“[It] took us a while to settle in and then to get a victory. To start the season no matter what year it is, it’s always good to be 1-0,” head coach Jason Gill said. “You don’t ever want to be chasing .500, you want to be ahead of it.”
While Saturday’s fences didn’t see any action from USC’s bats the Trojans still managed to pull off a dominant 5-0 win. Turner, Clay and O’Guinn picked up RBI’s alongside freshman shortstop Nate Clow whose single in the first jump-started the offense.
On the defensive side, redshirt sophomore pitcher Chandler Champlain picked up from where he left off last season, striking out six batters while walking zero. 
With the help of redshirt sophomore first baseman Clay Owens and some outfield hustle from O’Guinn, only one LMU player advanced to third during Champlain’s six innings. Redshirt junior pitcher Brian Gursky made quick business of LMU’s batters during the final innings, striking out four of his 10 batters to pick up the save.
“They are trusting their defense and I think our defense played excellent behind them,” Gill said. “Zero errors and a lot of balls put in play, and so, that’s kind of a recipe for success.”
On Sunday, The Trojans let a 6-5 third inning lead slip away. For the next six innings the teams battled back-and-forth on the scoreboard, resulting in USC burning through six pitchers. In the ninth inning another fielding error allowed Lions’ freshman pinch hitter Evan Leibl to advance the runner on third and tie the game 8-8. 
“Offensively, I wouldn’t have changed a thing,” Owens said. “We put our team in the position to win the game multiple times, but it just didn’t work out for us in the end.”
USC looked like it could secure a win in the first extra inning with redshirt freshman second-baseman Connor Cirillo advancing to third. Unfortunately for USC, Cirillo was left stranded after redshirt junior shortstop Ben Ramirez grounded out to LMU’s pitcher. 
The game came down to the bottom of the 11th inning when USC redshirt junior pitcher Jason Starrels allowed a single from junior centerfielder Kenny Oyama to seal the deal with a pinch runner scoring. 
Despite failing to close out the series sweep, several new Trojans stepped up and proved themselves in the team’s first outing. Clow, who logged his first RBI Saturday, also clinched a homerun on Sunday in his debut as a freshman pitcher and shortstop. Behind the plate, freshman catcher Garrett Guillemette led the defense with 18 total putouts and one assist with a second-base stealing caught on Sunday. The freshman also logged two hits and a run over the course of the series. 
The Trojans now look forward to a home series against Cal Poly next weekend. First pitch is Friday at 5 p.m.

USC fell to No. 13 Oregon 72-48 Sunday at Galen Center. The Trojans are now 10-10 overall and 8-9 in Pac-12 play. 
Sophomore forward Alissa Pili led USC in scoring and was the only Trojan to break double digit points on Sunday, scoring 14 points on 42.9 % shooting from the field. Pilli also contributed with six rebounds, two assists and one block. 
USC sophomore center Angel Jackson was second on the team in scoring, chipping in nine points for the Trojans over 18 minutes played. Jackson also chipped in one rebound and a steal.
USC head coach Mark Trakh highlighted Jackson’s aggressiveness in the tough matchup after the game.
“Angel did a really good job,” said Trakh after the game. “I just see her working harder everyday in practice, and I see her with a gleam in her eye and a spring in her step, and I just think she’s going to be really really good moving forward.” 
Jackson discussed the energy she brought to the matchup after the game. 
“I don’t like it when people are down,” Jackson said. “My team — they know that about me so they just trust in me. They are always there to hype me up and I’m there to hype them up.” 
For Oregon, freshman guard Sydney Parrish led the Ducks with a team high 17 points and four steals. Three other Ducks — senior forward Erin Boley and redshirt sophomore forwards Sedona Prince and Nyara Sabally — scored in the double digits, contributing 13, 11 and 11 points, respectively. 
The game started with the Ducks finding immediate success from behind the arc. Of Oregon’s first 14 points, 12 came from behind the arc.
Pili started off hot to counter the Duck’s early barrage, scoring the Trojan’s first seven points, but by the half, Oregons’ 3-point shooting success had overwhelmed USC and led to a 39-25 lead. Much of the Ducks’ lead was built by continued success from 3-point range during the second quarter where they shot 50%. 
USC continued to struggle in the third quarter, shooting 26.7% from the field and missing their only 3-point attempt of the quarter. Oregon’s play during the quarter wasn’t exceptional — the Ducks managed to shoot 37.5% from the field and and an unimpressive 22.2% from 3-point range — but was still enough to expand their lead to 19 points by the end of the quarter. 
Despite his team’s blowout loss, Trakh expressed continued confidence in his team’s play and emphasized the need to continue getting better.
“We ran our offenses well; I thought our defense was decent, not great, but it improved,” Trakh said. “We got one more game, and then we got the conference tournament and then we got the WNIT or hopefully the NCAA depending on how we finish. I still have faith in the kids, and I know this is far from over and we just got to go and keep working hard and keep improving.” 
With only one game left on the schedule, Jackson emphasized the importance of maintaining focus heading into the postseason. 
“We know we have to work harder. We’re getting it together, but we always know there is more room to improve,” Jackson said. “So we’re going to buckle down, practice, buckle down on these last games we have, and we’re going to come out and fight, just fight.”
The loss was USC’s last game at Galen this season. The Trojans will head to Westwood next weekend to face off against crosstown-rival No. 8 UCLA. Tip-off is at 1 p.m.

This review contains spoilers. 
Written and directed by Chloé Zhao and adapted from the 2017 nonfiction work “Nomadland: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century,” “Nomadland” is like its namesake — it toes the line between two spaces and genres, never settling in one. Ultimately, the film chooses to inhabit a distinctly poetic home at the nexus of documentary and drama. This unique intersection is given new meaning in “Nomadland,” where real-life nomads star as themselves.
“Nomadland” balances a sweeping aesthetic vision with the more grounded reminders: this story isn’t meant to provide a rosy venture into the benefits of nomadic living; instead, it’s a glance at what it means to leave places and the people who take such ventures.
The film begins by introducing Fern, played by two-time Academy Award winner Frances McDormand, a widow who loses her job at the U.S. Gypsum plant in Empire, Nevada. She wanders from place to place afterward — working at an Amazon warehouse, to living in a gathering place for “nomads:” others like her who live out of trailers and on the road. The story follows Fern as she traverses across landscapes and meets new people, cycling back to the Amazon warehouse, harvesting beets at another job and leaving permanence before it gets too close to her.
Close ups of Fern in her van are juxtaposed with the moving scenery behind her. Voiceover dialogue takes place simultaneously over footage of landscapes. It’s a jarring kind of reality and loss that feels like a haunting of a space; a gritty reimagining of land affirming its human connection. There’s also quiet, more reflective undertones in the stories that these nomads share as they sit around the campfire, about their lives before they lost their jobs and their family members and became the people who found homes in “houselessness.” 
Poetic shots of Fern’s solitary figure are paralleled with her interactions with others. One relationship of significance is between Fern and Swankie, a fellow nomad whose brashness and strong personality make her easily the most unforgettable character in the film. 
When Swankie dies toward the end, the product of a long-term battle with cancer, the nomads host a campfire to commemorate her life. As the nomads pay respect to their former friend, the sparks from the campfire rise into the night, a visual allusion to these lives fading into the U.S. landscape and a greater, larger unknown. 
As Fern progresses in her journey into this unknown, a melancholic tone permeates the cinematography, contrasted with the sounds and images that are distinctly part of the story. We see the clothes cycling through a washing machine at a laundromat. We hear the nomads singing together, a reminder that there’s a temporary home to be found even in the most transient of places. 
The somber music that floats throughout the film conveys Fern’s own grief at losing her husband. Despite the fact that Fern constantly travels from one place to another, Zhao’s portrayal of Fern often feels stagnant, as if there’s still one place that Fern can’t ever leave no matter how much she moves. 
Perhaps that’s what grief is, and in that regard, “Nomadland” is full of grief. It feels like a meditation on the memories that weigh us down even as we separate ourselves from the places where they were formed. 
In addition, wider discussions of the dichotomy between a mere road trip and a life on the road invite the audience to consider the intent behind living. The distinction between the life of the nomad and those who participate in the nomadic life temporarily illustrate the importance of circumstance in determining whether loneliness is artificially or authentically constructed. McDormand’s performance shines in the latter, as her distant expressions imply not only her distance from others, but also the audience. 
“Nomadland” does feel slow-paced at times, dragging its feet in the stunning cinematography. However, the pacing indicates that this narrative is purposefully meant to mimic the lifestyle of the nomads who drift from place to place. It’s hard not to feel overwhelmed by the seeming emptiness of Fern’s life at times, but the emphasis is on the details. It’s the small elements, the sloshing of a coffee thermos or the echo in a canyon, that remind us Fern’s life defines a kind of home in and of itself. 
There are so many goodbyes in “Nomadland” that it feels like the story first and foremost pays homage to the absences in life. What’s most memorable about the film, however, is that it takes the time to acknowledge the presences as well — the presences of community, small moments of joy and humanity in a wider economic recession. 
Fellow nomad Bob describes the nomadic life best: “One of the things I love most about this life is that there’s no final goodbye … I always just say, ‘I’ll see you down the road,’ and I do. And whether it’s a month or a year, sometimes years, I see them again.” It’s a beautiful reminder that even the goodbyes themselves aren’t permanent, nor the places that created them. 
As far as storylines go, “Nomadland” wanders aimlessly, much like its central character. Yet in the moments where it needs to, it pauses to evoke a nostalgia in its audience for a bare, American life. It cherishes the bits of freedom and agency found in a raw kind of realness. It stops, and lingers.

Earlier this month, Korean American novelist Jenny Han did a great interview with NBC Asian America, where she spoke about the meaning of Asian American representation in her “To All the Boys” trilogy. What resonated with me most about this interview was Han’s words about Asian American storytelling as more than about struggle. 
It was possible, Han said, to write about an Asian American girl falling in love, a universal process for many young adults, and not emphasize difference. It was possible to normalize aspects of Asian American identity and culture without struggle as the main focus. 
I don’t have much to add to Han’s words; she articulated everything that I had been struggling to say. So, in true Zoom University discussion board format, I want to center Han’s words by responding with experiences of my own. 
First, though, I want to preface with some context: I love young adult novels. Back in the 2000s, I was a “Hush, Hush,” “Fallen” and “The Mortal Instruments” kind of girl, and I would read any book with a mysterious woman in a ball gown on the cover — which is to say, nearly half of the young adult shelves at the local library. My greatest memories from when I was younger stem from sitting in that little corner of the library, listening to Taylor Swift’s “Fearless” album over headphones and devouring the latest installment of Ally Condie’s futuristic “Matched” series. 
It was only natural, then, that I’d want to start writing young adult fiction of my own. When I first started writing, I wrote mainly about white protagonists in dystopian settings because I thought that was the standard. 
As I grew older and into my identity more, being a young adult felt a little different from the kinds of stories I read about. Instead of writing those stories, I started focusing more on Chinese Americans in distinctly Chinese American settings — my version of a young adult novel. 
Like Han, as I ventured more into the writing community, I began feeling like there was pressure for my work to be a work of struggle. Once, in what felt like an extended hate comment about my writing, a white workshop instructor griped that my subject matter wasn’t what he believed Chinese identity was about. Until that moment, I had never really thought about being Chinese American as a commodified experience for white consumption.   
It felt like the only time my voice as a writer was valued was when I was integrating my Chinese identity in ways that felt artificial to who I was and became exploitative of trauma. It felt like I needed to write about my parents’ immigrant struggle and hardship in order to be considered significant. These were parts of my identity, but they weren’t all of it. I stopped writing for a long time because I was always considering whether or not I had unintentionally boxed myself in as a Chinese writer.
(Disclaimer: many Chinese writers do write about immigration and hardships in nuanced, illuminating ways. Those stories should be valued just as much as any other story. I would never claim that my experiences are universal because they’re not.) 
In reality, I just wanted the freedom to write about Chinese people having supernatural powers or having forbidden romances with hot fallen angels or worrying about other concerns than their pursuit of the elusive American Dream. To put it plainly, I wanted to write young adult novels without necessarily incorporating ideas co-opted as part of a Chinese writer’s identity. 
Recently, I’ve dipped my toes back in young adult fiction. I read Chloe Gong’s “These Violent Delights” these past few weeks and absolutely loved it. It was the first young adult novel I’d read that featured discussions of Western imperialism and Chinese history and a protagonist implicitly struggling with Chinese and American identity without having that become the central focus. 
Moreover, “These Violent Delights” is a retelling of “Romeo and Juliet,” and I think that’s what makes me love it all the more for what it represents to me: that it’s possible for Chinese writers to pay homage to the works that have shaped us while interpreting those stories in our own ways. 
There are so many other Chinese authors that are redefining the young adult genre. Katie Zhao’s forthcoming young adult novel “How We Fall Apart” is described as a mix of “Crazy Rich Asians” and “One of Us is Lying.” It’s about the competitive Asian American school environment, but it’s also a thriller and a dark academia murder mystery. Having read Katie Zhao’s previous work on Wattpad, I can already tell it’s going to be amazing. 
Xiran Jay Zhao’s young adult novel “Iron Widow” is also a story I’m incredibly excited about. As a reimagining of Chinese empress Wu Zetian that combines mythology with all the makings of a young adult novel, it’s the kind of premise that I loved reading. It’s also the novel that I think, subconsciously, I’ve been waiting for a long time. 
Just seeing these authors redefine what it means to be a Chinese young adult novelist makes me want to start writing again. I’m still afraid of many things — mostly the hate comments that make my face burn — and I’m worried about being labeled as a Chinese writer. Yet, I think Chinese young adult novelists are doing so much incredible work in the genre and like the Chinese writers before them, are paving the way for more Chinese stories to be told. 
Most importantly, these stories make me believe that one day, the young adult genre will be full of stories that Chinese writers want to write about. They make me believe that one day, we can redefine the young adult experience and show the wide range of narratives Chinese writers have to offer. 
That might be a little futuristic, but it’s the kind of future I want to see.

From releasing her first single, “White Boy” in 2019 to becoming an internationally recognized singer-songwriter, Jensen McRae is making her spot in the music industry with her lyrical poems and dusky melodies. Often strumming away on her acoustic guitar, the 23-year-old has an unforgettable celestial voice.
“I’m a poem,” McRae said. “People often ask me how I write things [and] my inner monologue is narrative. I see the world in complete sentences or lines of a verse. I often feel like a poem inside of a meat suit.”
She had a reason to feel this poetic epiphany. When an anxious 12-year-old McRae waited in line at a charity event, clutching a letter addressed to her idol Alicia Keys, little did she know that she would take home more than just an embarrassing photo. 
“It felt like a sign from the universe,” McRae said. “She asked me if I was a musician and I said yes, and told me to keep doing it.”
From then on, McRae cherished that moment and took it as a call to pursue music. 
Along her ongoing journey as an artist, USC alumna McRae created folk and alternative pop-sounding music, always writing from her heart. Personal experiences, books, television shows and stories from her friends inspire her songs. By prioritizing authenticity and the significance of underrepresented voices, McRae empathizes with her audience through mainstream platforms such as YouTube, Twitter and TikTok. This sensitivity toward others developed at a young age, she said.
Growing up in Los Angeles, taking piano lessons and with a firm grasp on writing, McRae experimented with poems at an early age, which later informed her songwriting. Inspiring her brother Holden McRae in the process, McRae began elaborately executing exquisite performances for her friends at school, family and fans on YouTube. 
“Seeing her thrive in that environment, it seemed like the logical choice and it seemed like a place that I would definitely want to be,” said Holden, a freshman majoring in popular music performance. 
McRae’s proficient talent for songwriting was resolute in a song written for her 7th grade English class. From there, she began producing thoughtful pieces evoking empathetic themes, connecting with her listeners. McRae’s music resonated with promising potential and inspired those around her.
“She continued to do that in addition to self-motivation and becoming more confident with her image. I think it’s great how she started off by being genuine to herself,” Holden said. “I’ve seen that stuff my whole life. To see other people enjoy her art is really nice to see.”
As McRae gradually communicated to a diverse audience, a new scope defined her prospects as a musician, advancing her insights and shaping her personality geared towards musical styles.
“She was very thoughtful, very quiet, taking it all in, extremely thorough. She was remarkably dedicated and had incredible work ethic,” said Chris Sampson, associate professor of songwriting and founding director of the popular music program at the Thornton School of Music. 
When she was in high school, Sampson first met McRae at GRAMMY camp, a summer camp for young musicians. His songwriting lessons continued at USC, which McRae later attended. Thrilled with her progress, Sampson said he believes she deserves to be heard. 
“It’s important that people hear  what she has to say because she is one of the smartest writers I’ve ever worked with,” Sampson said. “It’s very gratifying to me that she has been able to write at such a high level.” 
According to Sampson, McRae hasn’t changed her style at all and has kept true to herself, connecting with audience from all walks of life.
“When we are connecting with an audience through songs, it has to be authentic, it has to come from a place that is genuine to the writer, and Jensen is very skilled at drawing upon her own experience, her own feelings, her own advantage point,” Sampson said. “But then she’s able to translate that into larger themes that resonate and connect with a universal audience.” 
The larger theme of womanhood and rape culture in her song “Wolves” draws from shared yet concealed experiences among McRae’s audience, written from her personal reflections and stories from her friends. Her dedication and determination to endow memory and meaning into each verse validate a sense of catharsis. 
“Jensen’s remarkable skill is to take these very genuine, authentic moments and feelings and impressions and transform them into something that universally people can have an emotional response to,” Sampson said.
As a musician, McRae faced her sophomore slump in college when she realized that an academic setting stripped away her ability to put focus toward the joyful elements of making music. Although she felt restrained by the structural obligations required of academic standards, she soon broke free. 
“It is optimal to learn the rules in order to break them,” McRae said. “I realized that I had a baseline of mastery over a lot of the more technical elements of user creation and that I also had more freedom because I could more easily identify why what I was doing was working or not working.” 
In the end, USC entrusted McRae with the confidence of a writer, performer and musician. The swift lyrical tasks and constraints required by her classes challenged her to new depths when it came to a Phoebe Bridgers vaccination anthem.
On Jan. 14, McRae tweeted about coronavirus prospects in an imagined Phoebe Bridgers song. Little did she know, it would go viral and within a matter of hours, she was an internet sensation. After establishing a TikTok following by writing songs based on random journal entries, McRae decided to take initiative. 
“I thought that in the spirit of my online presence of writing songs very spontaneously and improvisationally that I would just write the song that I was talking about. I said to seize the moment,” McRae said. “In 10 minutes, I wrote that first verse and then the next day, it blew up a little bit and then the day after that, my phone was just ringing off the hook of people saying I broke the internet.” 
Together with her team and producer Rahki, McRae spent the night  finishing and recording the song. 
“Immune” was released on Jan. 27 as a Jensen McRae track rather than a Bridgers parody. The viral song’s captivating lyrics serve as a post coronavirus vaccination anthem despite the bleak reality of social distancing.
“It’s a fictional story about two friends who’ve had feelings for each other for a while who are going to get vaccinated together,” McRae said. “And because the line at Dodger Stadium is so long, they end up hooking up in the car, and they feel weird about it after.” 
After taking the lead in creating the visuals for previous songs, “White Boy” and “Wolves,” McRae plans to also work on a music video for “Immune.”
Named one of the 21 artists of #YouTubeBlack Voices Class of 2021, McRae hopes to take this opportunity and invest in creating visuals for her music, which will continue to resonate with politics, race and frankly personal stories. 
“I’m excited to be a part of it because I’ve never really seen Black art honored so intentionally that way. It really spoke to my mission statements as an artist, which is to show the full multi-dimensional experience of the Black community,” McRae said. “The only way to do that is by doing what the YouTube Black Voices campaign has done which is choosing Black artists who are all different shades, different gender identities from different countries representing different genres of music.” 
Music acts as a processing mechanism for McRae to convey political or emotional topics. Reflecting on a short conversation with producer Rahki, she recited dark lyrics of fear and anxiety universally shared by women in her single “Wolves.” Borrowing from an uneasy experience at a college party, she also wrote “White Boy” about microaggressions in interracial relationships. 
Besides writing and singing for her audiences, McRae listens to their voices, carefully noting their concerns, addressing their questions on her YouTube channel, Instagram and Twitter. She wishes to establish a platform for young people, enabling them to feel seen and heard. 
“I want to encourage people to listen more critically to music and to read poetry, and to just engage with language in a bigger way,” McRae said. “I hope my music inspires people to write their music, express themselves with more intention and clarity.”
Facing coronavirus’ limitations like any other musician, McRae aspires to reach musical milestones of merely making her music, supporting herself and traveling the world without any restrictions socially or physically. 
“I always say that I can tell a songwriter by their notebook and Jensen has one of the most amazing notebooks I have ever seen,” Sampson said. “She’s never without it. And I would see her take every moment that she had, that she could take. And she would be writing down her reflections, her stories sitting on some couch in the hallway.” 
Notebooks entailing descriptive encounters and keen observations helped McRae translate her struggles and efforts into melodies, incorporating a sincere nuance and distinguishing her from other artists. 
“I could actually tell instantly that she was a true songwriter,” Sampson said.  
Having already filled 16 journals, McRae is currently working on her 17th, reflecting her thoughts and impressions of the world into diary entries and lyrical rhymes. 
In the meantime, McRae plans on releasing an album at the end of 2021. Basing it on her childhood, adulthood and college experience, she completed the album in mid-2019, before the pandemic broke out. 
As a biracial woman from L.A., McRae sings about all the ways she has come of age. Especially noting her economic privileges growing up, the new album is about her realizing the world by leaving her parents’ protective bubble.
McRae’s unique style and mission statement as a singer-songwriter entail a mindful awareness of her listeners. First impressions have never been so inspirational and dimensional. 
Her lyrics are more than mere words, enticing room for interpretation, as she introduces new threads and nuances for her persistent listeners. The dimensional aspect of her songs offers a riddle of filling empathic memoirs, rather than catchy yet meaningless tunes.
“With Jensen you’ve got a multifaceted approach that allows you to appreciate her writing on multiple layers, through multiple listens, and that’s a rare quality,” Sampson said.

Celebrity culture is a continually evolving and perplexing field populated with unique characters who have captivated the attention of the world. The path to fame is an arduous one, which only the lucky few can ultimately achieve. What does that path look like today?
Currently, the term “influencer” is inexorably linked to celebrity status. Defined as “someone with the power to affect the buying habits or quantifiable actions of others by uploading some form of original content,” the influencer is a product of the technological age. While more traditional celebrities — the athletes, the musicians and movie stars — are still revered, they are forced to share the spotlight with influencers. Likewise, influencers and other conventional celebrities must continue to be held accountable for their actions. 
Ultimately, the shift in content consumed, or rather the explosion of new media, has caused this new type of celebrity. Social media can be accessed by anyone, instead of needing to appeal to conventional holders of power, like media executives or record labels. There’s no barrier to entry, and those who achieve fame are consistently entertaining to some audience. In this sense, what the path of the modern influencer offers is both democratizing and a viable career.
A recent Nielsen study notes that “YouTube overall reaches more people aged 18-49 than all linear TV networks combined.” While a share of YouTube content is created from traditional corporate entities, such as music videos or YouTube-produced TV shows through YouTube Originals, the vast majority of the billion hours of video watched on YouTube every day are self-produced.
TikTok, another influencer platform, became tremendously successful because it carefully tailors its user’s feed to meet their interests — taking advanced metrics such as watch time and user interaction to curate the best feed possible to their audience. With such a powerful program using immense reserves of data to determine entertaining talent, it’s comical to suggest any human could do a better job at finding what a consumer finds to be amusing.
The story of a successful influencer is eerily comparable to that of an actor. Take the story of David Dobrik, who moved to Los Angeles, faced financial difficulties and eventually gained enough of a cult following to amass a net worth of $7 million. Unlike traditional forms of media, Dobrik monetizes himself, his life and his friends as content. He isn’t the star of a television series, he is the series.
Even though all influencers do not meet the Hollywood mold or come to prominence with the help of a network or studio, they are still responsible for the mistakes they make. YouTuber Logan Paul famously filmed a dead body in Aokigahara, a Japanese forest famous for attempted suicide, and received enormous online backlash. Olivia Jade, a former USC student and beauty YouTuber famous for her less-than academic perspective on school, fell from grace after the Varsity Blues scandal. 
While many influencers have been problematic, plenty have used their power for good. Take Mr. Beast, a YouTuber with nearly 54 million subscribers whose content centers around entertaining and creative charitable activities. One of his most memorable initiatives was Team Trees, a collaborative fundraiser which ended up planting a tree for every dollar donated. He planted 20 million trees and was only able to accomplish the feat due to his enormous following. 
The influencer is not the model citizen by design, even if their platform elevates them to that status. Influencers should be held accountable for their influence, whether they’re engaging in controversy or advertising for a product. Furthermore, as college students and consumers of entertainment created by influencers, we have an obligation to hold them accountable, just as any other celebrity. 
Will influencers continue to be problematic? Certainly. However, that’s the nature of a single person having a tremendous amount of impact and not a problem with the way that celebrities are selected in modern times.

As the term “not-for-profit” suggests, nonprofits typically lack independent income, instead relying on outside financiers to support their mission. Considering I spent far too long brainstorming it, hopefully the name of my column, “Progress Without Profit” also makes this clear. If we can agree that nonprofits depend on others for funding, we must consequently ask ourselves, who are their donors? More importantly, does the dangling carrot of promised funds incentivize nonprofits to work in certain ways? 
Not all donors are created equal in the eyes of nonprofits. It takes less energy and effort for a nonprofit to receive $5 million from one wealthy donor, than to persuade 50,000 people of average income to each donate $100. In 2017, high net worth donors in the United States gave an average of $29,269 to charity, whereas general population households donated an average of $2,514. So, while people who attend fancy galas or participate in pricey silent auctions might contribute ten times more than the typical household, they are not the most representative of society. 
This disproportionate representation forces nonprofits to toe the line between pleasing their uber-wealthy donors and advocating for change that hurts those same donors. It is the ultimate example of “don’t bite the hand that feeds you.” Nonprofits, however, should not be afraid to call out the structures supporting their wealthy donors at the expense of the communities nonprofits want to help.   
Nonprofits are reluctant to speak about political issues, for fear of losing their tax-exempt status, but maintaining tax-exempt status is not mutually exclusive to advocating and addressing root causes of inequalities. Nonprofits can advocate and lobby for important issues, provided they follow certain rules. 
Nonprofits continually shy away from discussing the tax system — specifically, bringing attention to how loopholes benefit the wealthy. People served by nonprofits don’t usually have significant capital to invest, nor to leave to their children; their taxes typically will be on ordinary income (i.e., earned wages).  
Thus, it makes sense for nonprofits to strongly oppose things like capital gains tax treatment on carried interest, as well as estate taxes and corporate tax shelters that often exploit low-income people of color for the benefit of the white and wealthy. I understand that in the short term, nonprofits’ opposition to tax loopholes may damage relationships with the big (mostly white) philanthropy that fuels them, but long-term, this opposition supports nonprofits’ stated missions. 
Economic conditions allowing tax loopholes to benefit the wealthy also create stark income inequality. A full-time minimum wage worker cannot keep their family above the poverty line. Between 1978 and 2012, a CEO’s compensation increased by 875%, while the average worker’s compensation increased by only 6%. In a more relevant example to college students, many college officials earn over $1 million a year (President Carol Folt included), while more than 20% of their workforce on campus earn poverty level wages for a family of four. 
The same system that creates the poverty and economic issues nonprofits aim to remedy also allows mega philanthropists to exist in the first place. Nonprofits hesitate to confront and call out systemic issues because their prosperity relies on people who benefit from the current system. Complicity with the system reinforces the flawed logic that mega philanthropists negate the harm caused by the accumulation of their money by simply donating a small portion of it. 
I once volunteered at a gala for a nonprofit, working with other women who were members of the community the nonprofit served. The gala attendees who streamed into the event were old, white and rich — the opposite of the women who worked the event. The women put on smiles and politely chatted with the attendees to check them in. Once we heard attendees putting thousands of dollars down for auction items in the other room, the women finally put down the masks they’d worn all evening. They recounted racist and classist comments they’d heard in the last hour, but did not respond to in order to receive donations for the organization.
This disconnect between donors and clients is not an isolated event. Appeasing donors at the expense of clients is meant to benefit the population served in the long-term. But, does it really? 
The argument against nonprofits speaking out against the wealthy is that regulating exorbitant wealth eliminates money that goes to philanthropy. But if nonprofits went after tax policies and spoke publicly about income inequality, they would be creating a more just, fair system that requires less philanthropy after-the-fact. 
If nonprofits speak out against practices that benefit their wealthiest donors and lose support, they are not ruined. Smaller donations are the future of fundraising. Nearly 50% of all GoFundMe donors are millenials and Gen X, as social media becomes an increasingly valuable tool to build coalitions of small donors for a cause. In fact, 82% of millennials report they’ve donated to a nonprofit in the last year. 
I understand that nonprofits are in a tough spot. I truly do. I’m sure many want to speak out but have to make the choice between advocating and funding. I don’t blame them for prioritizing funding, when the alternative is the collapse of a life-saving program or the firing of an essential employee. 
In a perfect world, however, nonprofits wouldn’t rely on wealth gained from the exploitation of others to operate. Actually, in a perfect world, nonprofit services wouldn’t be necessary to begin with. Until then, nonprofits should not be afraid to ruffle the feathers of big philanthropy in order to carry out their missions effectively, honestly and purposefully.
