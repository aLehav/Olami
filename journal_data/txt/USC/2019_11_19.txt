Elle Fersan, director of the USC Immigrants and Global Migrations Initiative, is preparing materials to help students as the Supreme Court decides whether or not to allow President Donald Trump’s cancellation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. As the future of the program is being evaluated by the court, many undocumented students face uncertainty about their status in the country. 
“We know this is coming,” Fersan said. “And we’re working to create legal pathways to mitigate this issue if DACA is rescinded. Obviously, we can’t do anything illegal, so we have to find creative ways to legally address the needs of our students.”
The IGMI is an initiative from the Office of the Provost and the Gould School of Law that advocates for undocumented individuals both on and off campus by holding events and conducting research.
Without DACA, which grants those illegally brought into the United States as children the chance to work and go to school legally, undocumented students would not be able to study in the country. The Trump Administration announced plans to challenge DACA in early 2017, but the Supreme Court did not hear oral arguments until Nov. 12. According to CNN, the majority-conservative court will likely rule to end the program.
Selena Castillo, a DACA recipient and a freshman majoring in international relations, said the recent hearing forced her to consider a future without the program.
“We live on a limbo,” Castillo said. “I’ve been thinking about all my plans for the possible outcomes … trying to cope with this idea that we can lose that little bit of stability that we do have. It’s hard because we’re different, but we’re living a lifestyle as though we’re the same.”
If DACA is rescinded, undocumented members of the USC community may turn to programs available on campus. Improving Dreams, Equality, Access, and Success is an organization on campus dedicated to giving students a safe space to talk freely and connecting them to the resources they need. IDEAS, currently shares space with La CASA, and is pushing for a permanent space to provide continuous support for those affected should DACA be struck down.
“IDEAS started as a community of support,” said IDEAS executive director Valeria Resendiz, a senior majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change and political science. “[It was a] space where you could build community and feel safe with one another; develop professionally, develop socially.”
The group also partners with the Immigration Legal Assistance Center, which offers free consultations and covers the cost of DACA renewals for USC students. Vanessa Gomez Brake, associate dean of religious life, acts as a resource that undocumented students can turn to for counseling and assistance.
“[Citizenship status] is not something you talk about necessarily, just in passing,” Gomez Brake said. “So providing this safe space where they can come to me and talk to me about everything that’s going on, I then am able to point them in the right direction in terms of the resources they’re seeking.”
In the wake of the Supreme Court hearings, President Carol Folt recently tweeted her support of undocumented students who participate in the program.
“@USC continues to stand in solidarity with our #DACA recipients,” she wrote. “Dreamers are an irreplaceable part of what makes our school, our city and our country such an amazing place.”
Despite Folt’s promise, some feel the University could do more to protect and support undocumented students. Their citizenship status makes it challenging for them to find jobs or internships while studying at USC. 
The Undergraduate Student Government published a three-page scholarship resource guide for undocumented students, and the University has an eight-page resource guide to help guide undocumented students through financial aid and scholarship processes. 
On top of the money available through the California Dream Act, which offers financial aid to qualifying undocumented students, the USC Financial Aid Office also provides additional assistance to some. Still, their citizenship status makes it largely impossible for these students to find jobs or internships while studying on campus.
“Right now, I’m a Norman Topping Scholar,” Castillo said. “I’ve been a Bovard Scholar, Summer Bridge Scholar. So USC has given me a lot of money and resources.”
However, Resendiz said that while resources exist, many remain unaware of what is available to them in the community.
“We do have community support; however, it’s really decentralized, so students aren’t really aware of this information,” she said. “Sometimes it’s not even publicized. You just have to know the right people to have access.”
Resendiz said that USC should train its faculty and staff to better understand and accommodate the needs of undocumented students, especially now that DACA is in question. Gomez Brake is forced to fill two roles, serving as both a religious leader and point person for these students.
“As much as I enjoy the work, I think it would make a lot more sense if we had dedicated staff and a space for this particular need,” Gomez Brake said.
Ferson promised that IGMI is going to do everything it can to improve the situation on campus. It will begin by assembling a comprehensive and easily accessible list of all the resources available to undocumented students.
“It’s daunting for students to look for these resources,” Ferson said. “But when they find them in one place, it will be much easier for them to navigate this huge structure.”

As protests continue to escalate in Hong Kong, students in various USC programs in the region have had their classes moved online. The demonstrations against a bill that would allow extradition to mainland China began in June and have grown more violent since, with protesters fighting back against police. 
At the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, where USC students in the World Bachelor in Business Program study during their sophomore year, a local student died Nov. 8 after falling from the third to second floor of a parking structure during a protest several days earlier. 
As protests grew more violent, HKUST communicated with USC and decided to move classes online, Marshall School of Business Manager of Undergraduate International Programs Sean O’Connell wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
“As always, the safety of our students comes first,” O’Connell said. “We are working closely with our partners at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology to stay aware of the situation in Hong Kong and to take appropriate and necessary steps for the safety of our WBB students.”
Outside USC students from Hong Kong, others have returned home, are traveling or will be leaving soon, according to O’Connell.
Georgia Stahl, an international programs coordinator in the Annenberg  School for Communication and Journalism, said the one student in the Annenberg Hong Kong program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong will also finish their classes online for the remainder of the semester. Stahl and other abroad coordinators met last week and decided that moving classes online would be the best way to ensure student safety. 
Stahl said six students had planned to attend the CUHK program in Spring 2020, but the international programs office helped some of the students join other programs or remain at USC for the semester. 
Yakira Matisonn, a sophomore in the WBB program, said classes were canceled from Nov. 8 through Nov. 13 following the student’s death because his death led to more protests. Rather than lasting for a few hours each day, she said the protests lasted all day and into the early hours of the morning and were more violent than before. 
Matisonn said she and other students left within a few days of the announcement that classes would move online for the semester. Now that she’s home in South Africa, Matisonn must complete two online lecture classes and will have to coordinate with classmates to work on group projects and turn in assignments across different time zones. 
Matisonn said she understands the safety concerns but had a hard time leaving Hong Kong after meeting students involved in the protests. 
“For my friends and I, we had very mixed emotions,” she said. “My roommate and I started because it’s a very complicated situation, and we feel very deeply connected with the situation in Hong Kong because we’ve been living there. A lot of us have gone to the protests … [and] seen everything firsthand.”

The Undergraduate Student Government proposed a resolution to incorporate the Student Assembly for Accessibility under the Programming Branch of USG during the Senate meeting Tuesday. SAA represents students with disabilities on campus. 
The Programming Branch of USG currently encompasses a variety of student organizations, including five special-interest committees that plan campus events and 10 community-focused assemblies that represent the interests of different student groups. Assemblies such as the Black Student Assembly and Queer & Ally Student Assembly serve as funding and advocacy umbrella organizations that unify individual member organizations. 
USG Director of Accessibility Affairs Gwen Howard, who helped draft the resolution, said the inclusion of SAA under the Programming Branch would allow the organization to reap the various benefits of USG’s recognized assemblies. These benefits include increased funding and greater visibility and support that comes from a USG endorsement. 
“What works best to change culture is bringing people together and talking about different issues,” Howard said. “That really can’t happen without a budget and settings and venues and being able to be face-to-face with other people and build camaraderie around that.”
Statistics cited in the resolution indicate that disabled students do not believe they receive adequate services or recognition on campus. A 2018 survey conducted by former USG Director of Accessibility Affairs Hailey Robertson found that 50% of participants were not satisfied with the level of academic support and resources for accessibility. 
Co-director of SAA Javin D’Souza, who collaborated on the resolution with Howard, said the resolution would also build a stronger community on campus for disabled students. 
“This overarching representation is at least going to send a message to students that there is a space for you when there historically has not been,” D’Souza said. 
The resolution has garnered the support of Colleges Against Cancer, Kicks for Kids, National Alliance on Mental Illness and Eye to Eye, all founding member organizations of SAA. 
The resolution calls for SAA to be integrated as the 11th cultural assembly of the Programming Branch after a successful trial period, which would last from Jan. 13 to March 31. SAA would be granted $6,000 from the administrative budget during the trial semester to fund member organization expenses. 
During the meeting, the Senate also passed more amendments to the 2020 Elections code to clarify issues of candidate endorsement and elections teams. USG members, excluding those from the Elections and Recruitment team, Judicial Council, associate director of marketing, director of graphics and the elections commission, may publicly support and campaign on behalf of candidates. However, they cannot endorse candidates, and support cannot hold affiliation with USG.

After a spectacular 41-17 victory at Cal last Saturday, things are looking up for head coach Clay Helton’s Trojans. After the weekend, USC is now ranked No. 23 in the latest College Football Playoff rankings, and — more importantly — half a game behind No. 7 Utah in the Pac-12 South. 
A win against crosstown rival UCLA Saturday would improve the Trojans’ record to a respectable 8-4 and keep USC’s faint hopes of a Pac-12 Championship alive. Provided the criticism USC has faced all season, both achievements might go a long way in determining the future of the program. 
But before the speculation begins, the UCLA game comes first. 
The Rivalry 
Last year, USC fell to UCLA 34-27 in one of the Trojans’ worst performances of the disappointing 5-7 season. 
Despite the sting of the loss, redshirt junior wide receiver Tyler Vaughns insisted that Saturday’s game is not about revenge. 
“Not at all,” Vaughns said. “It’s not revenge for these guys. It’s reset and just play this game. It’s not revenge at all. We’re just trying to go out there and ball out like we usually do.” 
But according to many players, the sting of that loss hasn’t entirely faded. 
“Obviously, last year, we didn’t get the outcome that we wanted,” sophomore wide receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown said. “So I think we’re all coming into this week with a little chip on our shoulder.” 
When asked about how special the USC-UCLA rivalry is, redshirt sophomore offensive tackle Jalen McKenzie underscored the game’s significance. 
“It’s the biggest week of the season — from the standpoint of self-pride, university pride,” McKenzie said. “It’s all of that, so you’re playing for everything.” 
With all the noise and hype that is sure to accompany the days leading up to the game, offensive coordinator Graham Harrell emphasized the importance of preparation.
“Hopefully it doesn’t affect us too much,” Harrell said. “Obviously, there will be a lot of outside stuff going on and for both the fanbases it will be a big game. We got to give ourselves the best chance to go play well and the best way to do that is to prepare the right way.”
Freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis echoed Harrell’s sentiment.
“I’m really excited to just get an opportunity to compete — any week, regardless of whether it’s a rivalry,” Slovis said. “We don’t want to get too emotionally involved, we’ve just got another game on Saturday.”
Vaughns also reiterated that the team’s mindset won’t change for the rivalry game. 
“It’s business as usual,” Vaughns said. “We’re trying to go 1-0 this week. We’re not trying to focus on putting too much hype on the game or anything like that. We’re just trying to go out there and beat them.” 
Support for Coach 
At many schools, an 8-4 record and a bowl game are evidence of a successful season. At USC however, this performance and the results of the last two seasons are simply not enough. 
Given the likelihood that Saturday will be Helton’s last regular season game as USC’s head coach, his players made sure to voice their support. 
“We support him 100%,” Vaughns said. “He had our backs when we came here and recruited us out of high school. We’re just trying to give him our best.” 
St. Brown added that contrary to what many may think, most of the players don’t pay much attention to the controversy. 
“A lot of us don’t even see it,” St. Brown said. “We’re not all on Twitter or social media like you guys. So we don’t even see all the stuff that people [say]. Like I said, we just go out there … We know what the players are and what the coaches are, and we just go out and play.” 
Injury Report
Helton said redshirt junior running back Vavae Malepeai practiced in full pads Tuesday and is getting more confident after undergoing knee surgery in October. He remains day-to-day. 
The coaching staff also intends to ease Vaughns, who is still recovering from an ankle injury, back into the offense. Helton said the standout receiver looked better during Tuesday’s practice than he did in last week’s practices. 
Sophomore linebacker Palaie Gaoteote IV is unlikely to play against UCLA.

The USC women’s basketball team suffered its first loss of the season Monday, falling to UC Santa Barbara 57-46. 
The shorthanded Trojans were undefeated before the road contest in Santa Barbara, posting a 3-0 mark following a trio of comfortable wins to open up the 2019-20 campaign. 
The Gauchos were 1-2 heading into the matchup, coming off a tight loss to San Jose State.
Injuries and mistakes killed the Trojans, who were without standout graduate transfer guard Stephanie Watts and senior forward Kayla Overbeck due to injuries. They remain without freshman guard Madison Campbell and redshirt sophomore guard Shalexxus Aaron, who have yet to make an appearance this season due to their own respective ailments. 
The freshman duo of forward Alissa Pili and guard Endyia Rogers shouldered the offensive load. The two built upon strong starts to their Trojan careers; each posted 10 points, and they combined for 11 rebounds. 
However, the Trojans struggled to run offense and keep possession of the ball all night, finishing with 19 turnovers, one lower than their season high mark of 20, and 9 more than UCSB’s total. 
The Gauchos made USC pay for its turnover woes, winning the points off turnover battle by a mark of 22-5, a gap of 17 points in a game that was decided by 11.
A strong stretch from the Trojans gave them the lead following a 5-0 personal run from Rogers, but the Gauchos answered back with an 11-0 run to jump out to a lead they did not relinquish. 
Stout defense from UCSB limited the Trojans to 3 points for the final five minutes of the first half, and the Gauchos carried a 34-26 advantage into halftime. 
The offensive struggles would continue for the Trojans, as a dismal 20-point second half ensured UCSB never had to look back. The Gauchos won the game comfortably despite a late push from head coach Mark Trakh’s unit. 
The previously mentioned comeback effort nearly came to fruition as freshman guard Alyson Miura sank a clutch 3-pointer to bring USC within 2 points with four and a half minutes to play. 
The Trojans’ late push fell short, however, as the Gauchos pulled away in the late stages to bring the lead to double digits.
Trakh commended his team for its continuous effort despite being so shorthanded.
“I don’t fault the young kids at all — there’s going to be a learning curve, and they’re a talented group that’s working hard,” Trakh said. “We’ve just got to keep moving in the right direction and being very patient with them.”
Trakh also added that a recent slew of injuries have forced the young Trojans into a “baptism by fire,” as they’ve been forced to adjust to the speed and intensity of the collegiate game on the fly. 
The Gauchos were also spurred by a dominant performance from freshman forward/center Ila Lane, who had a double-double with 21 points and 12 rebounds, including five offensive rebounds. The win moves UCSB to an overall mark of 2-2 on the year.
Santa Barbara was also led by junior point guard Danae Miller, who filled the stat sheet with six rebounds and four assists to go along with 12 points. 
The Trojans shot just 25% from the free throw line, on 2-of-8 shooting. In the Trojans’ first three games, which were all wins, they shot over 90% from the charity stripe in two games and 78% in the other. While not the only issue in USC’s first loss, this would be troubling for the Trojans should the trend continue. 
Trakh attributed USC’s free throw woes to inexperience. 
“I think that’s youth and understanding; you’ve gotta be ready to play and understanding that teams are going to come after you,” Trakh said. “I think that’s a learning experience.”
USC women’s basketball is back in action against star junior guard Chennedy Carter and No. 6-ranked Texas A&M Saturday at Galen Center at 5:30 p.m.
As for his expectations for Saturday’s big matchup, Trakh said he’s looking forward to seeing how his team responds to the UCSB defeat and competes against some of the top talent in the country. 
“I think how we bounce back and what kind of heart and desire we play with will give me a barometer on this team,” Trakh said. “The future is bright — we just have to be patient.” 
Saturday will certainly be an early test for Trakh’s young squad, and the Trojans will be eager to make a statement against a premier opponent following their first loss of the season.

Cheating is the most infuriating thing to a sports fan. From corking a bat to using performance-enhancing drugs, scummy players will always find a way to gain the upper hand on their opponents. 
Last week, the Houston Astros organization was accused of using computer and video technology to steal pitch signs during its 2017 World Series-winning season. An act like this is disgusting from a professional baseball team, and serious consequences must be handed down. 
It’s a good thing that esports are so heavily regulated to mitigate cheating and deem performance-enhancing drugs useless. Right? Not even close. 
While professional gamers aren’t pumping their muscles full of steroids to move their mouse more vigorously, professional esports has seen its fair share of cheating scandals and corruption at the professional level. In 2015, Cloud9’s CS:GO team was embroiled in controversy after it came out that the entire team was using Adderall to improve alertness and reaction time for the ESL One Katowice 2015 Tournament.
Perhaps the most notable cases of cheating came from the eXTREMESLAND 2018 Asia Finals. Nikhil “forsaken” Kumawat of OpTic Gaming was caught using an aimbot, a computer program that assists the user with aiming, during the tournament.
Cheating might be a bigger problem in esports than in its traditional sports counterpart. The root of this issue lies in the basis of esports. Youth e-athletes don’t play on teams; they start their digital sports career alone. Them and the computer. 
All you need is a computer and an internet connection to play esports. No coach. No team. No officials. While this structure is appealing for players looking to dive into esports, it carries several problems with it. 
Take youth baseball, for example. From the very first day, you are held accountable. Umpires, coaches and teammates will teach you right from wrong and 99% of the time will prevent you from cheating. That form of accountability doesn’t exist within esports, as cheating is normalized from the amateur level.
There is no one to prevent players from popping Adderall before playing a competitive match in the comfort of their own home. Amateur tournament officials aren’t testing its players for PEDs.
Anti-cheat algorithms have gotten impressively good in the past several years — handing out permanent bans to cheaters while limiting the number of false positives. However, the cutting edge anti-cheat systems are only as good as the cheating methods they are trained to find. It will be a long time before anti-cheat systems can identify new forms of cheating without human interaction. 
The cheating issue in video games is twofold. 
Primarily, it is infuriating for new players. How would you feel if you played in a high school baseball game and a freshman on the opposing team hit the ball over the fence 100% of the time, threw 110 mph and caught literally every batted ball? You would be pretty pissed off. Now imagine if that happened in a significant portion of the games you played in. That’s how the cheating situation in esports feels. 
This is utterly discouraging to players who are trying to play the game fair and become better the right way. Players feel the need to install cheats to compete, leading to more cheaters and more players quitting the game. 
Yes, you are going to play with cheaters on your team every now and again, but no one wants to win illegitimately. 
The second — and perhaps more significant impact — is in the way it could affect professional play. As mentioned earlier, several players have taken their cheating ways through the amateurs all the way to the professional stage without getting caught. 
With esports attempting to one day become an Olympic sport, competitive gaming needs to clean up its act. If this sport wants to be taken seriously, it can’t enter the Olympics like the athletes in the doping-infused 2004 Olympic Games. 
For esports to gain traction on a multinational stage, spectators shouldn’t have to worry about potential cheaters slipping through the cracks. Moreover, if competitive gaming is to continue to grow at the rate it has in the past several years, video game companies need to minimize cheating as effectively as possible. 
Cheaters destroy the integrity of the game, but even worse, they destroy the community of the game.

Over the past week, students, faculty and the USC community have been in uproar over the quality of mental health resources on campus and with a justified reason. The deaths of nine students within the past three months, three of which are attributed to suicide, are prompting questions concerning how the community ought to move forward, with an even more pertinent concern for the well-being of students. 
Concerns over mental health are not new to USC, nor are they new to any other college campus. Every day, more research is conducted showing that students all around the country are struggling with their mental health. Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among the U.S. population, but it’s the second most common cause of death among college-aged students. 
Independent of college, young people are in a period in which their ability to regulate emotions are still in development. These biological factors coupled with the challenges of adjusting to a new environment makes sense of the anxiety and mental health issues that are emerging for many students regardless of their mental health history. 
Students are grappling with hopelessness and are searching for meaning, Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni wrote in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times in July. Soni, who also serves as the Vice Provost for Campus Wellness and Crisis Management, wrote that while students in the past had come to him asking questions about how they should live, they now are more likely to come in and question why they should live. 
It’s time for USC to start acknowledging mental health for the crisis that it is — one that affects the public health of the community. A public health crisis includes any sort of health crisis that has significant impact on the lives and social environments of people in a community. The consequences are not only felt in the individual lives of the people but also within the community’s institutions. 
It seems that the mental health concerns at USC have only exacerbated the insecurity and lack of transparency felt between members of the community and the institution. While students have suffered, whether it be with their own mental health or with finding answers over the past several months, the University’s response has felt like a disingenuous attempt to avoid further controversy. 
The University has shared minimal information about the students who have passed. Some information has even been reported incorrectly: USC provided the wrong grade and date of death for two students in community-wide emails. Administration has sent emails out aiming to dispel any mistruths about the cause of death but such notice is already made clear and accessible to all through public DPS reports. 
In 2018, USC Student Health expanded their counseling services with the addition of 10 new counselors, but this new expansion doesn’t even provide on-campus care for 100% of students. According to Robert Mendola, executive director and division chief for counseling and mental health services, the expansion aims to send 20 to 30% of students off-campus for counseling resources. 
While it’s helpful to have decreased the number of students needing to go off campus for mental health counseling, it’s still an inadequate system. In addition to the logistical challenges posed by sending students off-campus, many students who are granted on-campus treatment are only allotted a certain amount of sessions or until rendered mentally stable enough to not need immediate on-campus care. 
The subpar mental health services combined with the weak communication about these services by the University is a disservice to students at USC. It is unclear where the line will be drawn for the University to recognize that this community in particular is in severe need of extra support regarding the mental well-being of its students.
In many ways the challenges faced by USC students are quite bigger and more complex than those on other campuses. USC is home to hundreds of victims of sexual harassment and misconduct at the hands of its own health professionals. It’s home to students whose parents are being criminally indicted for bribing their children’s admission. And as of this semester, it is now home to many students whose peers have died. It’s time for a change in how we care for the mental health and well-being of all students.

In light of the recent deaths on campus, many students are grieving the loss of loved ones or are supporting friends who are grieving. To mourn in a healthy way and effectively support our peers, it’s important to make an effort to understand how people experience grief and address some common misconceptions.
To empathize with those in mourning, it’s key to understand the various emotions one may be experiencing. Perhaps the most well-known conceptualization of grief comes from Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’ five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. 
While this systematic progression through grief may be helpful to some people, modern research has shown that there is actually no “standard” way to grieve. In fact, Kübler-Ross’ theory referred to patients who were grappling with their own terminal illnesses rather than the loss of loved ones.
In reality, there are many differences in the ways people grieve the loss of loved ones, and most people don’t progress through each of the five stages methodically, if at all. These differences depend on a variety of factors, including cultural background, personality type and the nature of the loss. Additionally, grief varies not only by the person, but also by the loss within each individual.
Simply put, there is no right or wrong way to grieve. The five stages of grief should not be used as a step-by-step guide to properly mourn. In fact, adhering too firmly to this framework can be harmful — it can induce feelings of pressure or guilt within those who are not experiencing grief in the proposed five stages. The best thing one can do to support a friend in mourning is to listen. Although it may feel helpful to tell them about our own or other people’s experiences with a loss to help them understand their own feelings, this can be counterproductive because you could be setting them up with false expectations. For example, telling someone that it took you three months to get over the worst of the pain can make them feel panicked if their pain has not lessened at the three-month mark, or even guilty if those feelings faded far earlier.
Another misconception about bereavement is that pain and sadness should consume your emotions. Actually, positive emotions are both normal and healthy and should not elicit feelings of shame or disloyalty as they often do. According to George Bonanno, a clinical psychology professor at Columbia University, positive emotions in the months following a loss can indicate resilience and healthy long-term outcomes. 
Finally, it is important to make a distinction between uncomplicated and complicated grief. In the initial stages of uncomplicated grief, it is common for individuals to experience intense sadness, difficulty concentrating and disengagement from daily activities. In a study by clinical psychologist Mary-Frances O’Connor that looked at brain scans of grieving people, women who had lost a loved one in the past five years showed activation in the same parts of the brain that process physical pain when reminded of their loss. 
Given these symptoms, it is crucial for professors to be understanding and lenient to support any bereaved students during this period. Furthermore, a review by Catriona McDaid, a senior research fellow at the University of York, found that group therapy can be an effective intervention for people mourning suicide-related deaths.
Even though this initial acute grief may feel unbearable, it is a healthy, normal part of uncomplicated bereavement. Eventually, uncomplicated grief will progress from acute to integrated, meaning the pain will fade as the grieving come to terms with their loss and find new ways to maintain the presence of the deceased in their lives.
On the other hand, complicated grief occurs when an individual does not make that transition, meaning the symptoms of acute grief persist over a prolonged period of time. These symptoms include difficulty accepting death, avoiding things that remind them of their loss, recurring pain, intense yearning and feelings of bitterness or anger. 
In the same study conducted by O’Connor and her colleagues, patients who were diagnosed with complicated grief also showed brain activation in the part of the brain involved with the feelings of pleasure and reward that come from social attachment. This implies that they are still holding onto their relationship with their loved ones as if they were still alive rather than coming to terms with the loss.  Due to interactivity in that part of the brain, patients have a harder time regulating the anger, bitterness and sadness characteristic of acute grief.
For all of these reasons, assessing whether someone is experiencing complicated grief requires a certified clinician. In these difficult times, it is more important than ever for USC to have enough mental health professionals to not have to turn any students away or refer them out.

Los Angeles shelters some of the most diverse and eclectic menus in the country. It contains countless of ethnic food enclaves that rival the nations themselves, constantly pushing the boundaries for healthy alternatives and showcasing hundreds of talented chefs. There are many dishes that L.A. has seemingly perfected — tibs and injera in Little Ethiopia, Thai boat noodles in Hollywood, tacos in a thousand different permutations. Over the past few decades, this city has slowly transformed into a gustatory wonderland.
But the pizza still isn’t quite right.
Or at least, there’s a standing assumption that the pizza in L.A. isn’t quite right. 
Compared to a slew of cities heading east, pizza culture appears to have never hit California with the same urgency. Unlike its cracker-crusted, deep-dish, square-cut, honey-dusted counterparts, California pizza never bothered to distinguish itself. In fact, one of the only identifying factors for L.A. pizza is a blatant disregard for precedent, topping pizza with smoked salmon, barbecue sauce or even pasta. 
Of course, part of L.A.’s pizza identity was formed by the chain California Pizza Kitchen, which has built a reputation for unorthodox, outside-the-box thin crust pies. Inspired by chef Ed LaDou of Spago fame, the concept of California Pizza Kitchen combined California cooking techniques with an Italian tradition, resulting in not-quite-Neopolitan pizza with an emphasis on flavor. 
After Spago started serving smoked salmon and cream cheese on a pizza, L.A. began to consider the Italian delicacy in a new light. Nancy Silverton’s Pizzeria Mozza offered a unique but delicious take on pizza, grounded in its expertly made dough and wood-burning oven. Quickly and steadily, L.A. began to solidify its Italian identity.
Now, in the surge of restaurants committed to quality ingredients and authenticity, great pizza can be easily found. Another Nancy Silverton project, Triple Beam Pizza, serves Roman-style square-cut pie by the ounce in Highland and Echo parks. Cosa Buona serves classics with bubbling cheese and a leopard-speckled crust of char in Echo Park. Jon and Vinny’s serves chilled burrata on razor-thin Neopolitan crusts on Fairfax. Pizzanista! serves mac and cheese pizza by the slice on Sundays in the Arts District, matched by a hefty selection of vegan pies. 
In a way, a city’s iconic pizza functions like a Rorschach test — a point of analysis for the uneducated tourist. Some cities base their pies off tradition (St. Louis’ bizarre provel-and-cracker situation), or comfort (Chicago and Detroit’s carb-heavy variations), or ease (New York’s marriage to the dollar slice). 
For many, California’s pizza might be interpreted as a desire to stand out, to haphazardly combine flavors in a desperate attempt to gain recognition. Will pho pizza be the next barbecue chicken? No.
I tend to view L.A.’s pizza as a direct dialogue with its citizens. California’s loose definition of a proper pizza allows for chefs to push into new culinary directions, with a blank canvas to explore from every angle. Without a strict cultural adherence to a flavor or style, each facet of the dish can be reinvented: Unique sauces, doughs and toppings have all made their mark in L.A. 
This uninhibited pie freedom also feeds into the assumption that L.A. has poor pizza possibilities. Expectations of red sauce and mozzarella cheese can be throttled by a Thai chicken pizza or a pizza hidden under a pile of arugula. Chefs can get too creative and fly too close to the sun. Take a New Yorker to the wrong pizza joint and watch their horror as their beloved slice is bastardized.
But a good pizza in L.A. combats all false beliefs. Thankfully, there are quite a few of them.

What do you get when a biochemistry major, a journalism major, a business major and a civil engineering graduate start a band? It sounds like the beginning of a bad joke, but the four members of Lori Loughlin’s Lonely Hearts Club Band have proven otherwise. On Oct. 25, they competed against three other groups at USC’s Battle of the Bands and won a $300 Amazon gift card as a testimony to their talent.
Lead vocalist and keyboardist Joseph Dabu, or JP, was scrolling through his Instagram feed when he saw the application for the contest. He immediately contacted his high school friend Bruno Pita, a biochemistry graduate student at UCLA who plays the bass. Pita then contacted fellow Bruin Joe Aleshaiker, a recent alumnus and civil engineering major. 
Lastly, Dabu reached out to Niles Miller, a junior majoring in business of cinematic arts  who he met at Remedy Through Music, a student organization dedicated to visiting local hospitals and retirement homes and playing songs for the patients, nurses and visitors.
Before they even started playing, what first characterized their personality was their group’s name — witty, original and just a little bit controversial. 
“We couldn’t come up with a name. We had a placeholder name [The Rivals] which was terrible,” Pita said. “I was actually ashamed of going up on stage like that … I couldn’t think of anything that was acceptable,” Pita said. 
On the last day the band was able to change its name for the competition, Pita desperately pulled up the Los Angeles Times and saw a headline about Lori Loughlin’s indictment. A lightbulb went off in his head. The alliteration of the three ‘L’’s was brilliant, and the callback to the quintessential Beatles album worked perfectly. 
“It’s funny because both Bruno and Joe are from UCLA and Niles and I are from USC,” Dabu said. 
But Pita hopes no one’s feelings were hurt. 
“I like to think of it as making your food spicy,” Pita said. “It might sting a bit but it makes the food more interesting to eat.”
Although the spice in their name is certainly ear-catching, the food — or in this case, their music — is what kept the audience enthralled and eventually led them to victory. Their renditions of “Don’t Let Me Down,” “Something” and “Somebody to Love” showcased their skills as musicians and proved that you don’t have to major in music to find your passion in music. 
Aleshaiker is living proof of this. Since graduating, he has been working on his music full time.
“I’ve been playing since I was 9 years old, so it’s always been a passion of mine,” he said. “For me at least, it’s definitely a big part of my life.”
Likewise, Miller, the band’s drummer, said his passion for music has always been present in his life. He learned to play the djembe and bongos with his dad and went on to play percussion and drums in middle school and high school. 
“I did do jazz ensemble for about a year, but then I stopped because it was too much with my current workload,” Miller said. However, he still considers playing the drums a great passion.
Pita, on the other hand, only started playing music his junior year, learning to play the piano on an iPad app and eventually picking up the guitar. But unlike his bandmates, Pita mostly sees the instrument as a stress-relieving hobby. 
“That’s how we actually started jamming together, he was just so hyped I think to have someone that played with him,” Pita said. 
Even though Lori Loughlin’s Lonely Hearts don’t identify as a Beatles cover band, the undertone and general respect for the iconic group is clear in their band’s style, and each member identifies with an individual Beatle. 
“I’m George, 100%,” Aleshaiker said. “I feel like George is always kind of in the background but is always contributing.” 
The other three have yet to reach some consensus. Bruno says he’s a Paul because he plays the bass and sings the higher harmonies. Dabu says he’s a Paul because he’s left-handed. And although one might be tempted to call the drum player a Ringo, Miller objected. 
“I decided to leave it up to the BuzzFeed quiz on there,” Miller said. ”And I got that I’m a Paul!”
Even though Lori Loughlin’s Lonely Hearts Club Band started out as a one-time performance, their win at Battle of the Bands was a definite confidence booster. 
“There was a lot of good competition, so I was actually kind of surprised that we won,” Aleshaiker said. 
Dabu agreed and lauded the other three bands they competed against. 
“We just banded together in September … and the other bands I’m sure, had been established, and probably were practicing more often than we were,” he said.
But Natalie Williams, a freshman majoring in art who attended Battle of the Bands, dismisses their humble remarks. 
“I wasn’t really surprised they won,” she said. “They had a lot of energy and were really hyped up. It was obvious they practiced a lot.”
In the end, it wasn’t just their hard work but their passion for music indisputably paid off. 
“We just wanted to have a good time,” Dabu said. “I’m glad we did that.”

Therese Kelley hasn’t slept much in the past week. 
Kelley hasn’t turned her phone off since her son’s friend and fraternity brother died while at school at USC last week. While her son’s been grieving and going to a funeral and vigil, Kelley is thousands of miles away at their home in Charlotte, N.C., waiting for calls and texts to see how he’s doing.
Even though her family is close and communicates often, Kelley said it’s been hard not seeing him as he grapples with tragedy. So when she came across the Local USC Moms and Dads on Call Facebook page that Rory Bennett, an alumna and mother of a current senior, created to offer support to students, she joined right away.
“I’m 3,000 miles away and [with] everything that was going on, you start to feel very helpless,” Kelley said. “And then when you have moms, parents who are saying ‘We get it, and we don’t want our students to feel this way’ … I responded immediately.” 
And Kelley wasn’t the only parent who wanted to make sure her children had support. Since Bennett started the page last Tuesday, nearly 1,400 parents and students have joined. Bennett said she sees the group as a “safety net” for students to know that, even if they aren’t close to their families or if they live miles away from them, they have adults to reach out to who can check up on them, give them advice or help them find resources on campus. 
The group doesn’t aim to replace professional mental health services or other resources students may need, but Bennett said she hopes it can help students get the support they need when they are looking for advice on a school project or need someone to talk to or check up on them when they or their parents think they need someone to talk with. 
“I come from the feeling like if the kids need something, we’re going to beat down the doors to be there,” Bennett said. “If somebody is reaching out and needs help, call me a helicopter parent, I don’t care — I’m going to be there in force with whatever a kid needs.” 
The group is also hosting its first event Tuesday afternoon on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street called Cookies and Cupcakes to give students baked goods and spread the word about the group. 
“[We want] to let these kids know that there are local parents, both moms and dads, that are here to help,” said Gina Eckstein, a mother who helped plan the event. “If they’re stuck in a bind or if they need somebody to talk with … just so that they feel that there’s a support system nearby.”
Even though she can talk to her son often, Kelley is comforted knowing there are adults nearby who can check on him when she can’t. 
“I am actually able to go to sleep tonight, knowing that if I had to pick up the phone or send a message to this group, somebody would be at my son’s door, banging that door down if he was at risk, or reaching out to him to give him a hug,” Kelley said. “That is what, ultimately for a parent, can make the difference between being here today or not being here tomorrow.“

Thursday’s Conquest festivities will no longer include a bonfire, as Trojan Pride Committee decided to cancel the annual bonfire in light of the Getty fire and will replace it with alternative activities. The USC Concerts Committee also announced Friday that rapper-songwriter Rico Nasty will headline this year’s Conquest concert.
Students said having Rico Nasty as a headliner came as a pleasant surprise, lauding the committee for booking a Black female rapper with an “edgier” background than many others in the genre.
“She doesn’t look like Nicki Minaj, and not in any type of negative way, but just like very different types … Black women in rap don’t have to be one type of image,” said Tia Richards, a sophomore majoring in public relations. “Especially considering the fact that USC is such a predominantly white institution, I think it’s cool that there is a headliner for the other population that goes here as well.”
Jonathan D’Aguilar, a freshman majoring in public relations, said he began listening to Rico Nasty’s music as a freshman in high school and is looking forward to seeing her live Thursday.
“As my first Conquest, it’s like a pretty big thing for me,” D’Aguilar said. “Rico Nasty is a little bit different from all [her peer artists]. She has a unique style of fashion and of music and rapping.”
The concert will take place Thursday at 5 p.m. in McCarthy Quad and also features EDM artist Channel Tres as its opener. Along with the concert, Conquest 2019 will include a rally that will feature the Song Girls, the Spirit of Troy, drag queen Angel Dust, USC Spirit Leaders and the football team, in addition to food trucks, carnival activities and more.
This year’s bonfire, an annual USC tradition first recorded in 1912, has been canceled due to concerns of insensitivity following the Getty fire, which was contained earlier this month after damaging 25 residences in the Los Angeles area, according to the L.A. Fire Department. The Los Angeles fire marshal and Student Affairs canceled last year’s bonfire due to air quality concerns.
According to the executive board of the Undergraduate Student Government Trojan Pride Committee, which plans the annual Conquest activities and opted to replace the bonfire with alternative activities, the decision to cancel the bonfire was made in conjunction with the UCLA Bruin Spirit Committee in recognition of the hardships those affected by the fire endured.
“It’s a really tough decision for us to cancel the bonfire because we can understand the cultural significance behind the event,” said Henry He, the director of the Trojan Pride Committee. “We feel like we are making the best decision we can right now because we definitely need to be respectful for the people [impacted by the fire] in the first place.”
In place of the bonfire, the committee plans to set up a mural for students to cover with handprints and will hold a “Pie the Bruin” activity during which students will throw pie tins of whipped cream at a wooden Bruin structure similar to the one usually burned in the bonfire.
“A rivalry game allows us to all unite against UCLA, and the bonfire — along with other events that we do — sort of symbolize that spirit, the Trojan pride that we have,” said Helen Yin, a freshman majoring in business administration. “I think it’s also a hallmark of a tradition in college too, just to feel that college spirit.”

The Hollywood Reporter ranked the Thornton School of Music the second best music school for composition in film and television in the country and highlighted the school’s Screen Scoring Program.
“Without sounding arrogant, we are used to these kinds of rankings,” Thornton Dean Robert Cutietta said. “I don’t take that lightly, but I also think it’s an extremely good reflection of the school. There is quality in every corner of this school.”
The Screen Scoring Program has changed since its creation in the mid-1980s. Cutietta said the Thornton school modifies to reflect the changes in the musical landscape, especially with the Digital Revolution. Additionally, Cutietta and program chair Daniel Carlin implemented several changes, including transforming the program from a graduate certificate into a one-year master’s degree program for a cohort of 20 graduates. 
Students in the program take eight courses, receive individual lessons from faculty members and complete 10 recording sessions in different studios.
“It has far, far surpassed what I expected from the program in the most positive way,” said Austin Hammonds, a graduate student in the current cohort. “From the outside view, it’s this idyllic thing that everybody wants to achieve and get in and work hard and it’s a world-renowned program … transitioning to the inside view, when I’m here … it doesn’t feel like you’re this person that everybody [wants to be].” 
Hammonds said he is constantly surprised by each member of the cohort because he thinks everyone is on the same level and brings brilliant ideas, which fosters a healthy competition that in turn increases everyone’s talent.
“They do a great job of finding a diverse group of people who are strong in a bunch of different areas,” said Matthew Thomas, a graduate student in the current screen scoring cohort. “When we actually go into this program, not only are we learning from our faculty, but we are learning from each other and building on each others’ strengths.”  
Thomas said he enjoys the intensity of the program, which he believes mimics the fast pace of the music industry. He thinks the program places aspiring composers at the forefront of the industry, preparing them to find jobs or become freelance composers.
Carlin said the program’s location in Los Angeles has allowed participants to benefit from working with professional musicians and collaborating with the School of Cinematic Arts. All of the program’s faculty members, who also currently work in the industry, teach part-time and help recommend job opportunities and build networks for students. 
Cutietta and Carlin expect the program to change more with the industry, but there are no plans to expand the program despite high demand from prospective students.
“I think USC students really are a very special breed,” Cutietta said. “They are coming in and wanting to really do something with their art form.”

Students, faculty and staff from the Price School of Public Policy gathered Monday morning to discuss the school’s racial climate and the need for discussion of topics like implicit bias following an incident Thursday of alleged racial harassment. 
Nearly 75 members of the Price school community attended the two listening sessions hosted by LaVonna Lewis, the Price associate dean of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
At the talks, Lewis discussed the USC and Price school atmospheres for underrepresented students, giving audience members the opportunity to voice their thoughts and ideas.
“It is important to me that every student, staff and faculty member at the Price school feels like they belong, that they are valued and that they are not alone,” Lewis said to begin the discussion. “That is why we are here this morning.”
Lewis detailed the incident in an email to Price students, staff and faculty Friday and requested they attend Monday’s listening sessions. Lewis wrote that several students from her Social Justice Issues in Public Policy and Urban Planning class had been discussing a project related to race, class and privilege in the Price student lounge when they were harassed by three white students. 
Lewis said one of her students, who is Black, and his group were told to be quiet. The three white students claimed that Black people didn’t face problems anymore. 
While the students targeted in the incident were not identified, Lewis said they expressed hurt and surprise in the aftermath of the incident.
“They felt silenced, they felt targeted, they felt afraid and they felt uncertain about their place at not just USC but at [the Price school],” Lewis said. “You can’t come in our house and cause harm and not be called out about it.”
Sol Price Center for Social Innovation Director Gary Painter said that while he was disappointed to hear about the incident, he hopes the Price school’s diversity and inclusion plan will yield positive results and improve the school climate.
“My first reaction was even a feeling of failure because it has to be our responsibility to make sure that our students … can come to learn, to belong and to engage on issues that currently face our communities, our country,” Painter said. “There’s a passion to … make sure that our students, our staff, our faculty do find this a place where they can grow and engage.”
Throughout the sessions, Lewis emphasized that the incident was not isolated but rather aligned with current prejudices and political ideologies.
“Clearly, we’re seeing behavior on campus that mirrors our broader society and the broader University, where there appears to be more willingness to share negatively our thoughts on difference and speak out loud our prejudices,” Lewis said. “While we are clearly not alone, that offers small comfort. We can do better.”
Price professor Erroll Southers addressed the audience at the first session, sharing that his time in law enforcement showed him the prevalence of attitudes like those of the instigating students and that those in the Price school community should continue to speak out when they feel threatened by prejudice.
“What happened on Thursday can and does happen here, and I think that’s the first reality we all have to deal with,” Southers said. “The most important thing for me in this conversation is safety and security. You should not feel unsafe, you should not feel at-risk, you should not feel that you can’t walk into a classroom and be yourself because of who you are.”

Cool, fun and edgy describe both the personality and music of Casey Asterino, a Thornton alumna whose stage name is Astrina. Asterino, who majored in music with an emphasis in composition and songwriting, describes her sound as a mix between “Radiohead and the XX, which are pretty different. But I think somewhere in between is where my music lies.” 
She often plays with fellow alumni Tre Ulseth (guitar), Haley Kloess (keyboard and background vocals), Philip Walker (lead drummer) and Kevin Nahai (part-time drummer). 
Asterino met her fellow musicians in October 2016 when they enrolled in a music industry class taught by assistant professor of practice Tim Kobza. Through the class, the members learned how to work together musically while managing their heavy course loads. After the class ended, they realized they had something special and decided to create an actual band, Asterino said. 
The members continued on with their music after they graduated, performing at places such as the Resident, The Federal, House of Blues, The Mint and the 626 Golden Streets Festival. 
Ulseth, a 2015 alum who majored in business and minored in studio guitar, met the band members when he was granted permission by the professor to take the course as a post-grad. He said he has found that his studies helped him take on a greater role in helping Asterino manage the band. Ulseth said his business background has helped increase the band’s marketing efforts, as well as made sure they take on opportunities that benefit the band financially. 
“It’s forced me to acknowledge the factors other than one’s music that leads one to musical success,” Ulseth said. 
Kloess, a 2016 alumna who majored in theatre, said her experience in acting has shaped her performance style. 
“It definitely helps with the comfort of being on stage and being OK in front of an audience,” Kloess said. “It’s also really helpful for collaborating with other people because when you’re in theater, you have a lot of different personalities, and everyone has to be on their game and know their part but also be able to coordinate with other people. I think that’s very helpful in music, as well.”
While they studied in his class, Kobza noticed that Asterino synced well with her fellow musicians, so they were invited to perform at USC’s Battle of the Bands, which took place at Ground Zero Oct. 25. Kobza liked their sound and knew this would be a great opportunity for Asterino to showcase her music. 
“I just thought that any opportunity that you can get in front of a new audience … and getting in front of some new audience members in a kind of return to her college venue that she used to play at when she was in my class, that’s kind of cool,” Kobza said. “Ground Zero was where we used to have our shows so it was pretty fun.” 
Asterino added that she greatly appreciated the chance to perform on campus since it brought her back fond memories of studying at USC.
“The part that was cool for me was playing at Ground Zero stage again because I haven’t done that since I was a student, so it was very nostalgic,” Asterino said. 
The band ended up winning second place among an array of talented musical acts. 
That performance meant a lot to Ulseth, who also enjoyed the nostalgia that it brought him. 
“Being able to play on that stage again, we played that stage back when we were in school, and it’s just a very nostalgic thing for me,” Ulseth said. “I remember when I was a freshman at USC watching other student bands perform there, and I was just envious. It seemed inaccessible. And now it is something that is accessible … It was kind of a wake-up call about the types of things you take for granted as you grow.” 
Kobza believes that Asterino has great potential for longevity in the music industry. 
“I think that Casey has a real gift for songwriting and composition,” Kobza said. “She has the background in classical music, which makes her have a little different take on the final product in terms of the arrangements and production of their music, which I think makes her and [the band] stand out.” 
As she leads her band into the future, Asterino’s driving hope is simply to be able to play music with and for other people for a long time.
“In the next few years, I hope to be able to tour and open for a bigger act at some point and start playing festivals,” she said. “[I want to] just grow my audience and build a community around it.”
