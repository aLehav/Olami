For over 100 years, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum has stood as one of  the city’s greatest symbols of sports culture and history. 
Adding to its historicity, the building is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Since it opened its doors on May 1, 1923, the Coliseum has played many roles throughout the years, serving as home to much more than just the Trojans football team.
The Coliseum is currently under renovation to prepare for more USC football and the 2028 Summer Olympics. For some, it may be hard to accept the changes coming down the pipeline for the historic venue, including the reduction of the number of seating and expansion of the box suites and press area. 
The renovations come with a $270 million price tag, as well as the renaming of the historic building as the United Airlines Memorial Coliseum. Nonetheless, it is likely that most fans will continue to call the stadium what they have called it for almost a century: “The Coliseum.” 
“When construction is complete, our home field will be the best it’s ever been, for our players, our students and our Trojan fans, and that’s thanks to the contributions from founders and alumni and partners like United Airlines,” said USC Athletic Director Lynn Swann.
When it was opened, the Coliseum was dedicated to the Los Angeles veterans of World War I and rededicated to all veterans in 1968. Five months after opening, the first football game was hosted in the Coliseum on Oct. 6, 1923, featuring a showdown between Pomona College and USC. The Trojans prevailed with a score of 23-7 in front of a crowd of nearly 13,000 people. 
Countless other historical matchups have taken place in the Coliseum. In 1946, Kenny Washington and the Los Angeles Rams broke the NFL color barrier in a 20-10 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles. Just three years later, the Coliseum hosted the first contest between the NFL and AFL champions, now known as the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl returned to the Coliseum in 1973 when the Miami Dolphins bested the Washington Redskins 14-7, making the Dolphins the first NFL team to achieve an undefeated season and take home the national title — a record that holds to this day.
On an international scale, the Coliseum has been renowned for hosting not one, but two Olympic Games in 1932 and 1984, and plans are already underway for its third in 2028. Many of the stadium’s most iconic features were added to the building for the 1932 Olympics, including the Olympic rings over the entrance and the Olympic Torch, which is now lit during the fourth quarter of USC football games and during the Olympics no matter where they are being held. 
Additionally, the seating capacity was raised from what was already one of the largest stadiums in the United States at 75,144 seats to 105,574 seats for the 1932 Games. The famed bronze athlete statues were erected for the 1984 games. 
The Coliseum has also hosted countless events in various forms of entertainment. Religious personality Billy Graham’s Southern California Crusade drew in the Coliseum’s all time attendance record of 134,254 people on Sept. 8, 1963. 
In 1985, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band played four nights in a row at the venue. Eight of the songs performed throughout the stint were recorded and immortalized on their 1986 box set “Live 1975-85” as well as in the “War” music video. 
The Coliseum has also hosted more recent musical affairs. The world famous music festival Electric Daisy Carnival was held in the Coliseum from 2008 to 2010 before making its permanent home in Las Vegas. The stadium was also used as a speaking venue for former South African president Nelson Mandela in 1990, and the site of John F. Kennedy’s nomination acceptance speech for president at the 1960 Democratic National Convention.
It is easy to tell why Southern Californians have a special affinity for the massive sports arena in USC’s backyard. It has been around for nearly every visitor’s lifetime. For USC students in particular, this stadium is the backdrop for many Trojans’ greatest memories.

The 18 new faces joining the Trojan football team will be looking to make a difference for a squad that looks drastically different from last year’s. The vacancies created by stars like Sam Darnold, Ronald Jones II, Deontay Burnett and Uchenna Nwosu, as well as major contributors across the rest of the roster, have left plenty of shoes to be filled. 
As daunting as the prospect of replacing over eight starters is for a team, the influx of talent in the incoming freshman class should offer plenty of hope for head coach Clay Helton and his staff. The class comes in ranked in the national top-five by both Rivals and 247Sports, as well as holding the highest average star rating for both services. Many of these highly touted prospects will have a chance to contribute immediately, especially in light of the recent departures from the team.

J.T. Daniels |  5-Star QB 
Immediately after he arrives on campus, Daniels will compete for the starting quarterback position following Darnold’s departure. The Gatorade National Player of the Year comes to USC after reassigning to this year’s class following a junior season that saw him throw for 4,123 yards and 52 touchdowns for Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana Calif. — all while throwing only four interceptions. Daniels led his team to an undefeated season and a national title — Mater Dei’s first in 28 years. 
The 6-foot-2, 205-pound freshman brings impressive arm strength and accuracy to the table, as well as an ability to create plays outside of the pocket, as proven by his 561 rushing yards and nine rushing touchdowns last season. Daniels will compete with redshirt freshman Jack Sears and redshirt sophomore Matt Fink for the starting position on the roster.
Amon-Ra St. Brown | 5-Star WR
The 5-foot-11, 190-pound St. Brown was arguably the best receiver prospect of this class, choosing USC over Notre Dame and Stanford, where his older brothers played. As a member of the same national champion Mater Dei team as Daniels, he put up a gaudy statline of 1,320 receiving yards and 20 touchdowns last season. St. Brown’s exceptional quickness, hands and route running make him a threat from anywhere across the formation, and a favorite to win a starting receiver role for the Trojans. 
Although incumbents Tyler Vaughns and Michael Pittman seem to have the outside receiver spots all but locked down, the departure of Deontay Burnett to the NFL leaves an opening at the slot receiver position. Although he will have to compete with returning receivers redshirt sophomores Velus Jones Jr. and Trevon Sidney, St. Brown could be in good position to take hold of the slot.
Olaijah Griffin | 5-Star CB 
The son of West-Coast hip-hop legend Warren G, Olaijah Griffin has the opportunity to make a name for himself in his very first season for the Trojans. A former UCLA commit, he comes to USC as the third-highest rated cornerback prospect in the country. Griffin has all the tools to be a lockdown corner at the D-I level, with a sturdy 6-foot, 180-pound frame, good man-to-man skills and excellent football instincts. The ineligibility of cornerback Jack Jones, last year’s starter at the position, leaves an opening in the first team defense opposite from senior Iman Marshall. Griffin could very well find himself in that spot at some point this season.
Isaac Taylor-Stuart | 5-Star CB 
Hailing from former USC running back Reggie Bush’s alma mater, Helix High School in San Diego, Taylor-Stuart will compete alongside Griffin for a spot atop the cornerback rotation. 247 Sports had him ranked as the best prospect to ever come out of San Diego, and for good reason. 
Taylor-Stuart’s physical toolbox is stacked. Speed kills at the cornerback position, and Taylor Stuart has it in spades. Although his claim of a personal best 4.25 second 40-yard dash seems hard to believe, 247 has his time listed at a blazing 4.30. In addition to his track-star speed, he carries a 6-foot-2, 187-pound frame — big enough to match up with even the bigger receivers at the collegiate level. His unique combination of speed and size makes him a name to watch this upcoming season.
More Names to Watch
The sheer depth of this freshman class makes it difficult to write anyone off as a first year difference maker. The No. 1 linebacker recruit of the country, early-period signee Palaie Gaoteote of Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, could very well have the most impactful season of any of the newcomers. Four-star defensive back Talanoa Hufanga from Corvallis, Ore., has been with the team since spring, and could make a bid to crack the starting secondary, possibly as Marvell Tell’s battering mate at safety. Four-star wide receiver ATH Devon Williams of Antelope Valley High School shouldn’t be counted out either, with the opportunity to make an impact on the receiving rotation.

This off-season, the Los Angeles Rams have garnered more headlines and attention than any other team in the NFL.
They added defensive tackle Ndamukung Suh and cornerbacks Aquib Talib and Marcus Peters to an already talented defense in blockbuster moves. On the other side of the football, the Rams bolstered the league’s highest scoring offense with yet another weapon for burgeoning quarterback Jared Goff. They traded for explosive wide receiver Brandin Cooks, who is coming off a 1,000 yard season with the Patriots. 
The Rams will undoubtedly make some noise in 2018. Each of their competitors in the NFC West — consisting of Seattle, San Francisco and Arizona — is going through upheaval of some sort (the 49ers, led by prodigy quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, are still likely one or two years away from the playoffs). In theory, this is the perfect year for the Rams to join the league’s elite and improve upon their surprising 11-5 season in 2017. 
But the Rams are not necessarily built for the long haul. Cooks is in the final year of his rookie deal (hints why New England had no problem flipping him for a first-rounder). Similarly, Peters will become an unrestricted free agent in 2020, while Suh signed on for just one year. 
On top of that, the Rams have yet to come to terms with a new deal for defensive tackle Aaron Donald, the team’s most dominant player. Once his rookie deal ends after this season, Donald could become the league’s highest paid defensive player, whether that contract comes in Los Angeles or elsewhere. 
With myriad young stars at the end of their cheap rookie contracts, the Rams won’t be able to pay everyone for the long haul. Tough decisions over Cooks, Peters, Suh and Donald are on the horizon, and the situation wasn’t improved by the team’s lack of a first or second round pick in this year’s draft. Head coach Sean McVay and Co. likely have a one or two year window to win big, or risk crashing and burning. By the time their new $4 billion, 300 acre stadium opens up in 2020, the Rams may not have the star power to match the impressive venue. 
In contrast, the Rams’ future roommates and cross town rivals, the Chargers, have not created much buzz this offseason. Coming off an ill-advised and overly combative “Fight for LA” campaign during the 2017 season, the Chargers embarrassingly struggled to sell out the 27,000 seat StubHub Center in Carson, Calif. in 2017. 
It was never going to be an easy debut season in Los Angeles for the Chargers. They alienated their only real fan base when they left San Diego in 2017, and the team lacks the Rams’ historical ties to the area (even though the Chargers’ first season in franchise history was played at the Coliseum). The Chargers’ move to L.A. was hard to see as anything more than a money grab for the Spanos family, which has owned (and barely operated) the franchise since 1984. 
Bad PR aside, the Chargers have at least built their roster for the long haul. The team’s core of running back Melvin Gordon and defensive ends Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram are still in the hearts of their current deals. 
Unlike the Rams, who weren’t able to add meaningful young talent in the draft, the Chargers took safety Derwin James at 17th overall, which was widely considered the steal of the first round (James was projected to go in the top ten by numerous outlets). They also added former USC outside linebacker Uchenna Nwosu in the second round, who ESPN draft guru Mel Kiper Jr. called “the best player on the board” at that point. 
“This Super Bowl we’re going to win,” Ingram told reporters on Monday, according to ESPN. “We haven’t been to the playoffs in a while. I think it’s going to be crazy, this Super Bowl we’re going to win is going to be crazy.” 
It’s difficult to see the Chargers reaching those heights in 2018, given their young roster and murderer’s row of a division (the AFC West includes the Broncos, Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs, who all look like playoff contenders). 
But the next five years look bright for Ingram and his team. The defense has quietly reached elite status with its stiff secondary (they gave up just 197 passing yards per game) and menacing pass rush, which created the fifth-most sacks in the NFL last year. Meanwhile, 36-year-old quarterback Philip Rivers appears to be only getting more prolific with age, throwing for 4,515 yards in 2017 with just 10 interceptions. 
The Rams have taken over the spotlight for now, but there could be a new leading team in Los Angeles sooner rather than later. One is built to win; the other is built to last.

Kanye West has, in many ways, been the most divisive artist of the last decade. The mere mention of the hip-hop mogul’s name is either met with sharp criticism or immense praise; reactions to West are rarely on the fence.

Unfortunately, his latest project, “Ye,” is not much more than a rehash of old tricks and attempts at sparking controversy. Throughout the album, West attempts to address his recent controversies involving his Twitter and TMZ interview. Unfortunately, he fails to utilize this tactic as effortlessly as he did on “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” which remains the artist’s magnum opus — an album that marked West as a musical risk-taker and hip-hop icon.
Though fans rely on West for his sonic innovation and reinvention, much of “Ye” adopts a similar style to that of “The Life of Pablo,” the rapper’s critically and commercially acclaimed 2016 album. Where “Pablo” is praised for its intentionally haphazard and elegant improvisational essence, “Ye” falters. What results is an occasionally great but ultimately disconnected array of messages, rather than a cohesive whole. 
“Ye” touches on several themes throughout its 23-minute run. The seven songs deal with fame and celebrity, love, family and mental illness. For the first time, West publicly reveals his battle with bipolar disorder, citing it as a superpower rather than disability on the track “Yikes.” In a similar manner, the album’s opener, “I Thought About Killing You,” is representative of his tangential, unpredictable thoughts throughout the record. 
From a musical standpoint, the album has several peaks, but the lyrics pale in comparison to the rapper’s past works. West attempts to regurgitate ideas presented far more eloquently in past albums. Consequently, “Ye” is a reflection of the artist’s failure to to evoke empathy among listeners.
On “Wouldn’t Leave,” West raps, “I say slavery a choice/ They say, ‘how, Ye?’” in a fruitless and simultaneously self-indulgent attempt to justify his thoughtless comment to listeners. Albeit well-intended, West fails to articulate his thoughts as well as he once did. 
A stronger track, “Ghost Town,” is a vast improvement over most of the album’s remaining tracks. The track features 070 Shake, a New Jersey rapper whose raspy verses steal the limelight on the song. “I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed,” she croons artfully. Yet, the record finds West hiding behind the samples and production rather than using them as a springboard for lyrical profundity. 
On the album’s closing track, however, West nails the biggest and most profound message on the entire project. On “Violent Crimes,” West addresses the shift in his views of women — from “something to nurture, not something to conquer.” Now West is embracing his role as a father as he pleads for his daughter to fully embrace her childhood and steer clear of what he warns to be dangerous men. He further cautions against the dangers associated with adolescence, from cutting class to standing at the altar, warning his daughter, most importantly, about predatory men. 
Despite its minor successes, “Ye” is Kanye West’s first album to feel like a retread of old ideas. While it forges into new sonic territory with “Ghost Town” and “No Mistakes”, the majority of “Ye” fails to paint the troubled artist as the genius he is often revered as. Instead, “Ye” feels trite and unoriginal, marking a rare musical misstep in West’s career.

Joe Moses is a proud man: proud of his parents and family, proud of his four children and proud of his commitment to giving back to the community that raised him. Now 33 years old with plenty of years of experience in the music industry, the Los Angeles rapper is steadfast in his values, and prides himself on loyalty above all else.

“I come from an old-school generation, how my family grew up,” Moses said. “Five dollars, I’m in debt with you. Two dollars and fifty cents, I’m in debt with you. A dollar, I’m in debt with you. It’s loyalty over everything.”
On his new EP “SuWop,” years of cultivating those relationships has paid off, in the form of high-profile features from longtime friends such as Ty Dolla $ign, Future, and Snoop Dogg. The project sees Moses returning to his musical roots, with songs he wants people to feel and resonate with rather than the “ratchet” music he created earlier in  his career. Creating the final tracklist was a painstaking effort, however; Moses recorded 290 songs before selecting only seven to release to the world, and credits his Artists and Repertoire representative for assisting in the year-long refinement process.
“This time I just did me, I felt comfortable in the studio and was more relaxed,” he said. “My A&R Shawn Barron helped me get through a lot and coached me through a lot. I don’t give him enough credit, just being there for me, and stepping up and helping me get my situation.”
Moses saved the most introspective moments for last on “SuWop,” spilling his shortcomings and regrets on the outro “Good Dad.” With personal lyrics about his own situations with the women in his life, the story is very much his own, but Moses hopes that others in his position will heed his words as well.
“It needed to be talked about, not just about my baby mama,” he said. “It’s about men in general, always putting the blame on women, when sometimes it’s us. This lifestyle changed me, I was a strong individual but it changed me. I take all the blame for my actions; you can hear it in the song, but everybody knows what they signed up for.”
On “No Yee Sh*t,” Moses breaks down his lifestyle over classic West Coast production. Snoop Dogg, one of the region’s pioneers, assists the song with a smooth, effortless verse. Moses was quick to praise the legend for being an integral part of his own journey. 
“Not even big bro, that’s like an uncle to me,” he said about their relationship. “I watched Snoop become the man that he’s became, and he watched me become the young man that I’ve became. I go to him any time I need some good game, good conversation, from a person who’s been through it.”
Lately, Moses has been following Snoop Dogg’s path in another avenue as well: getting involved in youth football. Moses is currently the owner of the Los Angeles Chiefs, which is part of the Orange County Junior All-American Football organization. Moses makes sure to use his platform and resources to uplift the kids outside of their regular schedule. 
“I get money for these kids, I spend it all on the L.A. Chiefs,” he said. “I take them to football games on Fridays and Saturdays, I spend time with them, I love them like they’re my nephews. We go on trips, we go to Magic Mountain and do all that. That’s like my pride and joy.” 
Now that he’s established himself in the community and the industry, Moses embraces the opportunity to give back in the form of advice as well. He often plays the mentor role to those in his circle, pushing them to create the necessary change in their own lives rather than waiting for outside circumstances to boost them upward.
“I’m trying to make my people take positions and jobs; creative control and building community resources,” he said. “When we start taking positions as a culture, black people will be much better. We’ll have mom-and-pop street stores and 99-cent stores, and we’ll run things a lot differently.” 
That self-starting mentality has empowered him to improve his own situation. Previously, Moses says his lack of focus was impeding his career trajectory. Through self-reflection and conversations with those around him, however, Moses dramatically improved his work ethic and eventually parlayed his talent and connections into a deal with Atlantic Records. Now, he recognizes the potential magnitude of the moment in front of him, and revels in his desirable position.
“I’m nervous, but I’m excited,” he said. “I’m blessed. From what I come from, shootouts in broad daylight, robbing, stealing and hustling, this right here is a blessing. I wouldn’t take this for granted for anything in the world.”

Last weekend, amid a barrage of strange and unprovoked racist tweets, Roseanne Barr left Twitter and her show, the eponymous “Roseanne,” was dropped by ABC. The cancellation was as sudden as the tweets themselves — near-indecipherable shouts in the dark, calling former Barack Obama aide Valerie Jarrett the child of “Muslim Brotherhood & planet of the apes” and stating, with no observable context, “Chelsea Soros Clinton,” before tweeting that George Soros himself was a “Nazi who turned in his fellow Jews to concentration camps.” 
Roseanne’s Twitter “rant” was in fact wholly bizarre, though unfortunately not uncharacteristic to those who knew her. Co-star Sarah Gilbert lamented that her “kids, and her TV kids, try to keep her off social media,” and that friends and family had encouraged her to step away from Twitter prior to the show’s launch. 
To take a step back, though, “Roseanne” had more to offer than its namesake  did. Although the actress is an outspoken Trump supporter, the show was not so much about supporting the president and his rhetoric as much as understanding whom it swayed. Barr the person is, quite obviously, to one degree or another a racist. But the show had a purpose other than to rationalize Barr’s political persuasions. The sitcom aired on Tuesday evenings, and held about as much importance and reverence as a weekday evening sitcom can; but its cancellation, though absolutely necessary, is also deeply unfortunate. Because its message was — in some way —  necessary.
There are some who will contend that it is unimportant to understand the white working class and its sociopolitical viewpoints simply because they are “wrong.” To some, there is no value in this exploration of cultural diversity, because the mere presence of problematic beliefs disqualifies them from participation in a cultural mainstream. It is true that toxic ideologies shouldn’t be allowed to permeate the national spotlight, but what “Roseanne” did was portray people who were seeking to catch up to the modern sensibility, not reject it out of some knee-jerk prejudice. 
“Roseanne” allowed us to  bridge that great gap of cultural dissonance for 30 minutes. Its message, soundly, was that of the many other ABC shows seeking to promote greater diversity, like “Fresh off the Boat” or “Black-ish” (granted, their creators do not e-shout “Chelsea Soros Clinton” in the middle of the day): That is to say “this is our day-to-day, these are our concerns, these are our struggles, this is how we approach them.” 
And by and large, Roseanne depicted a white working-class family tackling modern issues of social justice with a remarkably open mind. The message was not that these people do not care about or decry social justice but simply that they were doing their best to catch up with the concept of social justice. “Roseanne” forms an understanding of today’s issues in a town that’s still 15 years behind 15 years ago.
An example: Roseanne’s daughter (portrayed by Sarah Gilbert) and her two kids used to live in the big city, Chicago; they’re down on their luck, so they move back home to live with Grandma and Grandpa (Roseanne and John Goodman). Turns out grandson Mark (Ames McNamara) prefers wearing dresses to school. He’s eight. In the version of “Roseanne” people seem to presume, this would have been the moment a masculine Grandpa Goodman takes Mark hunting or teaches him carpentry or something, or they have a big heart-to-heart and find out Mark dresses this way because he saw it somewhere in the “liberal media,” or perhaps he’s only “confused.”
Instead, their concern is not how Mark chooses to dress — the family could care less what he wants to wear — but that the other kids will tease him at school. Roseanne tells him, “Come talk to your Grandma,” sits him on the couch, and explains to him that she’s afraid he’ll be mistreated. He says he doesn’t care, and she impresses upon him — “You know, sometimes you have to choose your battles. Is this really that important to you?” Mark responds: “Yes.” And Roseanne affirms that she’ll support him. He goes to school, he’s cruelly teased, and the next day Grandma Roseanne shows up at school and addresses the classroom — be nice to Mark, or I know where you live. Perhaps a crude take on a rust-belt version of justice, but nevertheless — this is their way of supporting Mark’s gender-nonconformity. It may not be the sophisticated nature of the metropolises, but Roseanne gets the message right. At the end of the day, it’s one of support.
The concerns of these people are the ones we hardly hear; their world is one that many in big cities and on opposite coasts will never observe. Grandma Roseanne, for example, is addicted to opiates, self-medicating to supplant a knee surgery she can’t afford. Grandpa Goodman notices that their elderly neighbor next door has passed away, and sneaks over to steal the copper piping (and the stair lift, for Grandma and her knee) before the estate sale. Roseanne’s daughter, waitressing at a local restaurant, convinces her coworker to go back to school — telling her that the free community college offers night school, and how to sign up. 
Just as “Fresh off the Boat” is a depiction of an immigrant narrative the mainstream deserves to understand, “Roseanne” represented another cultural niche by telling a different story. The show’s characters are not perfect, and they are not always admirable role models. But must they be? 
Although Roseanne Barr could not allow her story to take precedence over her racism, and although her cancellation was easily deserved, do not dismiss the meaning of  “Roseanne” due to its creator’s disappointing actions. What the show served to do was important, and hopefully, another similar series will take its place — albeit without a creator who has a penchant for spewing toxic beliefs. It is, at the end of the day, a genuine tale of a human experience told and observed through art. And as far as casual 30-minute television goes, that seems, at least to the viewer, to be the point.

Every once in a while — when I really want to torture myself — I scroll through Scott Pruitt’s Twitter account. Pruitt, the current administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and one of the most inflammatory members of the Trump cabinet, doesn’t seem to care about the environment or its protection.
Pruitt is currently under almost a dozen investigations for allegedly taking gifts from lobbyists, violating anti-propaganda laws and misusing federal funds for things like 24-hour security detail and a $43,000 soundproof phone booth installed in his office. On top of that, he also doesn’t think climate change is caused by humans, and rejects the scientific consensus that human-generated carbon dioxide is contributing to global warming.
With every action he takes, Pruitt proves that he has little interest in morality, science or environmental protection. Since his induction into office in February 2017, I have kept up with his actions and scandals, wondering what political agenda he is actually trying to advance other than barefaced contrarianism toward scientific fact. 
But on June 1, Pruitt published an editorial on Fox News’ website praising President Donald Trump for pulling the United States out of the Paris climate accord last year. The article, titled “Trump put America first when he withdrew from Paris Accord one year ago,” is the most direct expression of Pruitt’s worldview that I have seen: applying the “Make America Great Again” and “America First” ideologies of the Trump administration directly to our country’s handling of natural resources. I shouldn’t have to say this, but that’s a really, really bad idea.
First, I should point out that the “Make America Great Again” approach is dangerous in every aspect of politics; its implications of toxic nationalism have damaged our well-being and reputation in foreign relations, economics and equality. But this attitude is especially egregious when it is applied to the environment. 
Art by Chana Kim | Daily Trojan
The Paris climate accord was a historic moment in the international fight against climate change. It allowed countries to set their own respective goals for reducing carbon emissions, with the ultimate goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. There was no mechanism to force signatory countries into specific goals by specific dates; they were simply expected to set targets that were higher than they had previously set. It was a remarkably flexible deal that allowed each country to respond to their unique needs while moving toward a more sustainable global community, but that apparently wasn’t satisfactory for Pruitt. 
In his op-ed, Pruitt says that the climate accord was “a bad deal for the American people,” because it would require taxpayer money and would produce “no clear benefit for hard-working Americans.” I’d say there’s no clear benefit other than slowing sea level rise, reducing extreme weather events, finding sustainable energy sources, preserving animal and plant life and keeping the planet livable for upcoming generations. But to each his own, I guess. The fact that Pruitt is offended by using taxpayer money to hit carbon emissions targets, but has no issue spending $1,560 on custom-made pens makes the “saving-taxpayer-money” argument a bit hollow. 
Pruitt claims that the sustainability gains that the U.S. has made in the last 40 years, such as the lowered levels of major air pollutants, should be attributed to the “genius of the free market,” not government regulations. Nevermind the fact that the free market also caused those pollutants to be there in the first place, and that laws like 1995’s Air Pollution Control Act did nothing to aid this reduction. 
He also implies that the Paris accord would not fair to the U.S. because it does not put harsh limits on major polluters like India and China, even though the entire idea of the agreement was to let countries set their own goals. Nevertheless, he saw the contribution of American tax dollars to achieve a stricter goal than China or India had set as an unfair use of our funds, despite the fact that every dollar spent on sustainability can benefit and improve the lives of all Americans. 
In short, applying nationalist rhetoric to environmental issues and removing ourselves from international agreements is incredibly unproductive. While Pruitt wants to put “America first,” he disregards the fact that conservation is cooperative, collaborative and impossible to win — because the Earth doesn’t play favorites along national lines.

Two students at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism have been selected to be the 2018 Summer Associates through the USC Center for Public Diplomacy. Established last year, the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy and the center’s non-resident fellowship program allows public diplomacy students to obtain internships and to work with the ACPD to collect data and expand networks. 
(From left to right) Students Robert Dunbar and Daniel Toomey were selected to intern at the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy and the Mayor of Los Angeles’ Office. Photo from the USC Center on Public Diplomacy.
According to the CPD website, the associates work closely with ACPD on research projects, data analysis and creating different materials for PD practitioners.
Daniel Toomey, a junior majoring in journalism, will intern at the Mayor’s Office of International Affairs in Los Angeles as part of the Olympic Development Committee. 
As a summer associate, Toomey is currently assisting organizers with preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics, which will be hosted in Los Angeles. He will attend planning meetings, where officials will be making crucial and structural decisions on how the city will prepare for the event.
“When you’re hosting the Olympics, half the game is making sure you can even manage it,” Toomey said. “It’s a far ways away, but now is when you have to start planning for those types of things.”
Prior to interning with the Olympic Development Committee this year, Toomey has worked behind the scenes in other sporting events as well. According to Toomey, he worked with NBC’s features department as a production intern for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea.
“Daniel’s experience with NBC at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and his leadership within USC’s Annenberg Media Center are an important fit as we in the Mayor’s Office of International Affairs explore how best to action and communicate our ideas for the city over the next ten years in the lead-up to welcoming the world to Los Angeles for the Olympic and Paralympic Games,” Mayor Garcetti’s Director of Olympic and Paralympic Development Erin Bromaghim said in the released CPD article. 
Robert Dunbar, a USC public diplomacy graduate student, will work with the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy in Washington, D.C. 
“I’m really looking forward to getting experience with the federal government,” Dunbar said. “I haven’t interned for the government before, so that should be exciting. I’ll be working on the annual comprehensive report on public diplomacy spending that the state department does. I’ll be learning a lot about public diplomacy in the field of countering bio extremism.” 
Dunbar previously attended Saint Mary’s College of California, where he received a bachelor’s degree in political science. He is particularly interested in international affairs. Dunbar also spent a semester studying abroad in Italy and has fostered a particular regional interest in Spain, Italy and southwestern Europe.
“Hopefully I’ll be able to bridge the gap between the academic series that we’re learning in my program,” Dunbar said, “I hope to apply those theories to the actual field and practice related to national security policy.”

Brie Ortega has been hired as a temporary adviser to Norman Topping Student Aid Fund scholars.
NTSAF Governing Board Chair Sierra Williams announced the addition of Ortega to the Fund in a letter to scholars and Governing Board members late last month.
Ortega’s hiring comes after Christina Yokoyama’s termination as program director in February.  Provost Michael Quick announced then the removal of the NTSAF program director position as a part of an effort to restructure the program. Yokoyama served as director for 11 years, supporting first-generation, low-income and underrepresented USC students in the program.
Many scholars and former Governing Board Chairs opposed the decision to remove her position.
“The NTSAF is a student-funded, student-administered and student-led initiative, yet the decision to reorganize was devoid of any student voice,” the NTSAF Governing Board chairs wrote in a letter published in the Daily Trojan in early January. “We are requesting a reversal on the decision to remove the program director position, and that senior administration begins to work collaboratively with instead of against the governing board.”
Ortega received her bachelor’s degree in sociology from UC Berkeley and attended UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, where she received her master’s degree in social welfare. Her official first day at NTSAF was May 29. 
“After [Yokoyama’s] removal, a lot of students were complaining about the lack of support or the lack of full-time staff in the office,” Williams said. “In order to make up for that lack of social support . . . they hired [Ortega] so that students can have another person to talk to aside from the associate director as well as Dr. Andrea Hodge, who is the vice provost of undergraduate programs.”

The Office of Orientation Programs has implemented new changes to this year’s sessions. To encourage incoming students to bond with other freshmen and and their orientation advisors, they will be arranged into groups to solve a five-part challenge on facts about the University. Photo by Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
Beginning June 7, USC will host freshman orientation programs to welcome the class of 2022. 
Over the summer, USC will offer seven on-campus orientations, five off-campus U.S. orientations and three international orientations to accommodate the needs of rising freshmen. 
Several changes were made to this year’s orientation sessions. According to orientation advisor Minji Cho, one of the many changes includes a new interactive task for attendees. This event will take place at the beginning of orientation, once the incoming students are separated into their groups with other freshmen and their orientation advisors. 
“Rather than sitting in a circle and talking with their peers and orientation advisor, the freshmen will participate in a five-part challenge called ‘Trojan Challenges,’” Cho said. “They will go around campus while learning about USC facts. This year’s redesigned challenge will be a lot more interactive than previous years . . . it’s designed to help the students bond with each other.” 
According to Cho, the orientation advisors will also perform their annual “SCits,” which sheds light on significant campus issues for today’s students. However, they have added new topics that students may face during college, such as social anxiety and microaggressions. 
“Freshman orientation gives incoming students an opportunity to acclimate to the campus,” director of orientation programs Lisa Starr said. “It allows them to meet fellow students, touch base with their academic advisors and to experience a little bit of the Trojan Family before they start here in the fall.” 
Orientation is scheduled to take place over the course of two days. On the first day, students meet with their orientation advisors and groups, take necessary placement exams, attend seminars for their respective colleges and tour the University Park campus. During the second day, students register for their fall classes, learn about different campus services and organizations and are introduced to their residential colleges. 
“When students come to orientation, we want to start their journey towards academic success and to make sure they feel excited about their upcoming classes,” associate director of orientation programs Julia Stanton said. “The other layer to that is to connect students with other people . . . we’re really hoping that students have the chance to connect with not only current students, like the orientation advisors, but with other incoming students as well.” 
According to Starr, the most crucial aspect orientation offers are the academic advising sessions that students are required to attend. 
“At [their advisement appointments], they learn the nuts of bolts of what they need to do in order to be successful once they get here in August,” Starr said. 
Orientation advisors will assist incoming students and parents throughout the two-day event. According to Stanton, the advisors underwent extensive training during the spring semester to prepare for the arrival of new students. 
“We’ve got an amazing group of students, they just have a lot of great energy and each year, the students are really engaged and excited to foster the new class,” Starr said. “Their whole purpose is to let the incoming students see an actual student perspective and to have someone be a role model for them. They are there not necessarily to be the authority, but to be there as a resource.” 
From the spirit rally to the Student Services Fair scheduled during orientation, Starr hopes that incoming students will feel welcomed and take advantage of the University’s resources.
“To get the most out of orientation, I encourage students to attend as many events as they can and to take this opportunity to connect with other students,” Stanton said. “I think that connecting with other people — incoming students, staff and academic advisors — is what really makes USC a second home for students. Using the different resources offered will give students a strong transition to USC and everything that is ahead of them in their years here.”

Photo courtesy of USC Roski website
Prior to her appointment,   Lin-Kirk served as the vice dean of design and was a professor at Roski for over 17 years.  During her tenure as vice dean, she utilized her background in design education to push for interdisciplinary studies and individual practices, which she helped integrate into USC Roski’s programs and courses. 
“Haven Lin-Kirk is an exceptional choice to lead USC Roski,” Provost Michael Quick said to USC News. “She is a respected professor, an artist and designer, accomplished scholar and researcher. We are excited to see the USC Roski school under her leadership.” 
Beyond her work at USC, Lin-Kirk has lectured at other institutions such as Scripps College, Loyola Marymount University and Otis College of Art and Design. Lin-Kirk has also worked for clients like the Los Angeles Times, NASCAR and Adobe. 
Along with her experience in teaching, Lin-Kirk has showcased her artistic capabilities to the real world. Her art exhibits were held at locations such as the Brewery Arts Complex and East Gallery at Claremont Graduate University. 
“It requires countless contributions to actualize our students’ potential,” Lin-Kirk said. “I look forward to engaging with all who are a part of this school to continue to elevate the programs and their benefits for our emerging artists in the coming years.” 
Lin-Kirk’s deanship will officially begin on July 1.
