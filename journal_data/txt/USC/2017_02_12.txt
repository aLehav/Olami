At least one student plans to take legal action against StuHo, the parent company of the Element housing complex, after a series of construction delays led to poor living conditions for residents.
Sean Chapin, a sophomore majoring in human biology, said he met with legal counsel on Feb. 6 to discuss possibilities for receiving monetary compensation from the company. Chapin, along with numerous other residents of the housing complex, had to live in Downtown for several months while Element was under construction, and now experiences ongoing issues with the quality of the building. Residents of Element received a 20 percent discount off of their rent for this semester, but Chapin says that’s not enough.
“[The legal counsel] told me I can report [StuHo] to the Department of Housing if they’re subject to rent control,” Chapin said. “He gave me some next steps for negotiating with them and also said we could pretty easily win in small claims court. He also said we should be getting more than a 20 percent [discount].”
Chapin received free legal aid from Undergraduate Student Government, which offers counseling to undergraduate and graduate students each Monday. StuHo could not be reached for comment.
Element, which is located off campus at the corner of Adams Boulevard and Hoover Street, was promised to be completed in August 2016. Designed to have four stories with 46 townhomes and 4,100 square feet of street-level commercial space, the project experienced issues with obtaining city approval and delays with construction that are still not completely resolved. Students began moving into Element in late November.
However, residents say that construction at Element is still not completed.
“We’re moved in, but they’re still working on the pool, and some of the restaurants I think they were supposed to have in the front,” said Somya Dalal, a tenant at Element who is not a USC student. “They just finished the gym, but they’re waiting on equipment.”
Chapin said that he was also frustrated by the continuing construction at Element.
“I feel tricked,” Chapin said. “Getting woken up at 7 a.m. every day [because of construction] sure isn’t helping my stress.”
A representative from Element’s management, however, said that all construction was complete except for the pool, which was delayed “because of the rain.”
But Stacy Moroz, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said that she continued to experience problems once she moved in. Her original Element unit was compromised by water damage and a failed electrical system, and she was told by Element management to move into a completely new unit. 
“Complications with the first unit were borderline unbearable. Imagine activating a screeching fire alarm every time you took a shower,” Moroz wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We were expecting a functioning unit. So far it looks like we got one, but the first unit we had was also supposedly functioning until it quite obviously no longer was. I’m not exactly optimistic about the success of this one.”
Although the unit is an improvement from the small rooms in the Da Vinci apartments, Moroz said that its distance from campus and different layout from the three-bedroom, three-bathroom floor plan that was advertised made it less than ideal for students.
“In comparison to the Da Vinci apartment we lived in at the beginning of the year in Downtown, [Element] was better due to the proximity of commute,” Moroz wrote. “It’s ‘better’ than the previous accommodations, but in the same way a broken toy is better than the same not broken toy. With the same design and previous complications, who’s to say it won’t break again.”
Ultimately, residents at Element feel as though StuHo did not deliver on its promises. 
“We’ve just been waiting for a lot of things to be done, and I don’t think that everything we were put through is worth what we got,” Dalal said.

For the fourth year running, USC has placed in the top three institutions nationwide for fundraising. 
USC maintained its third- place position behind fundraising powerhouses Harvard University and Stanford University, which placed first and second, respectively. Alongside USC, the University of Pennsylvania, Cornell University and Yale University also rounded out the the top 10. 
The top 10 included mostly private schools like USC, with only two public schools, The University of California San Francisco and University of Washington. UCLA finished just outside the top 10 at No. 12. Combined, the top 10 schools collected almost a third of every dollar donated to U.S. colleges in 2016. 
Across the nation, donations to universities have kept up with the raising rate of inflation in 2016, reaching a combined $41 billion in donations, a growth of about 1.7 percent from the 2015 total. 
In total, the survey reports that USC raised more than $1 billion in gifts and new pledges in 2016, with nearly $667 million of them in cash. This marks an important benchmark on President C.L. Max Nikias’s Campaign For USC fundraising initiative, now in its sixth year, which has nearly reached its $6 billion fundraising goal to advance academic opportunities at USC as well as expand the University’s role as a positive impact on the global and local community. So far, the campaign has raised $5.89 billion from more than 300,000 donors.
“USC’s fundraising momentum keeps building, confirming how much our community of supporters believe in the exciting growth at the university,” said Albert R. Checcio, USC’s senior vice president for university advancement, to USC News.

Doheny Memorial Library transformed into a ballroom on Saturday night for the 29th annual USC Libraries Scripter Awards. The black-tie gala was held in the Los Angeles Times Reference Room.
The Scripter awards, established in 1988, recognizes screenwriters along with the authors of the original works they adapted. Originally the awards were given only to film adaptations, but last year a new category was created to recognize TV adaptations.
At the event, Provost Michael Quick shared the key role that libraries play in the academic life of the University.
“They are the core of what we stand for in higher education,” Quick said. “The unfettered search for truth, the accumulation over time of the knowledge that allows us to progress as humans, our launching point for future leaders. The libraries represent the absolute best of what it means to be human, of what it means to revere the truth, of what it means to make a difference in the world.”
This year’s winning author, Tarell Alvin McCraney, and screenwriter Barry Jenkins, were recognized for the film Moonlight.
There was also a tie tonight for the TV category between screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski with author Jeffrey Toobin for FX’s The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story and screenwriter David Farr with author John Le Carré for AMC’s The Night Manager.
According to the Scripter Awards website, the Scripter selection committee is “comprised of Writers Guild of America Members, Academy Award-winning and -nominated screenwriters, authors, film industry executives, faculty, and select members of the Friends of the USC Libraries.” This year’s committee, chaired by USC professor Howard Rodman, chose finalists from 80 film and 45 TV adaptations.
“One of the things I love about the Scripter Awards is that it’s the only award, that I’m aware of, that honors written work into film,” Rodman said to Red Carpet Report TV. “And, unlike many other awards that honor just the movie or television show, this actually goes back to honor equally, the writers of the original work.”
This year’s finalists for film adaptation included Eric Heisserer for Arrival, August Wilson for Fences, Allison Schroeder and Theodore Melfi for Hidden Figures, Luke Davies for the screenplay for Lion, and Barry Jenkins for Moonlight, adapted from In Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue by Tarell Alvin McCraney.
The finalists for television episodes included David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for the episode “The Winds of Winter” from Game of Thrones, adapted from the series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin, Erik Oleson for the episode “Fallout” from The Man in the High Castle, Tara Herrmann and Jenji Kohan for the episode “Toast Can’t Never Be Bread Again” from Orange Is the New Black, and Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski for the episode “Manna From Heaven” from The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story.
Every year the Scripter Award funds specific projects around USC. Sponsorship levels ranged from a $500 “Supporter” level which included dinner for one and a formal invitation to the Scripter Reception, to a $30,000 “Gold” level, which included dinner for a group of 16, transportation to and from the event, membership in the Dean’s Council of the Friends of the USC Libraries, and a private dinner with the Dean.

A late comeback attempt from USC was shut down by No. 5 Oregon Saturday night, as the Ducks topped the Trojans by a score of 81-70 at the Galen Center.
With 2:40 remaining in regulation, junior guard Elijah Stewart knocked down a 3-point shot that pulled the Trojans within three points of the Ducks.
Oregon responded by closing the game out on a 10-2 run over the final two minutes of regulation to clinch its 14th consecutive victory against USC. The Trojans have dropped their last seven games against the Ducks in Los Angeles, and they haven’t beat Oregon at home since the 2009 season. 
The Trojans finished the game by missing their last four shot attempts in the contest; USC made no field goals over the final 2:40 of regulation.
“That was a tough game. We played hard, but not well enough to win,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “Our guards were off tonight in their decision making and shooting. To beat a top-five team in the country, you have to play better.”
Poor shooting from the field was a struggle for USC all night Saturday. The Trojans finished the game shooting 22-for-59 (37.3 percent).
USC’s shooting woes may have been most evident from beyond the 3-point line. In the first half, USC shot 2-of-15 (13.3 percent) from beyond the arc. Overall, the Trojans shot 6-for-27 (22.2 percent) from distance.
“When you’re 6-for-27 from three and a lot were wide open and you miss three dunks, it’s hard to beat a team like this,” Enfield said.
A layup from sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright gave USC its largest lead of the night against Oregon, as the Trojans led 49-46 with just over 13 minutes remaining.
“Tonight shows our growth. It shows we can play with anybody,” said freshman guard De’Anthony Melton, who finished with nine points and two steals Saturday. “We need to learn how to close out games.”
As was the case for many USC shooters Saturday night, Boatwright had his share of struggles from the field. Boatwright finished the game shooting 3-of-15 (20 percent), but he did hit all eight of his free throws to finish with 15 points against Oregon.
Leading the way for the Trojans was sophomore forward Chimezie Metu, who recorded a team-high 16 points Saturday. Metu finished 6-of-8 from the field while reeling in four rebounds and dishing three assists.
“We have to protect the ball. We had too many turnovers,” said Stewart, who totaled 15 points on 5-of-10 shooting.
USC committed a total of 16 turnovers against the Ducks after averaging 11.1 turnovers per game entering Saturday. Oregon capitalized on Trojan mistakes, as the Ducks outscored USC in points off turnovers, 23-12.
Oregon junior forward Dillon Brooks finished with a game-high 21 points on 8-of-14 shooting. Brooks was 3-of-5 shooting from deep against the Trojans.
Brooks finished as the game’s leading scorer despite fouling out with 3:28 remaining in regulation.
Oregon sophomore guard Tyler Dorsey scored 19 points (6-of-13 shooting) and recorded five rebounds. Ducks junior forward Jordan Bell finished with a game-high 14 rebounds; he recorded a double-double as he also scored 12 points Saturday.
Overall, Oregon edged USC on the glass by a margin of 39-34.
With the loss, the Trojans were unable to avenge their 84-61 loss to the Ducks earlier this season on Dec. 30. USC has never upset an opponent ranked in the top five nationally at the Galen Center.
Saturday’s loss also put an end to the Trojan’s five-game winning streak in Pac-12 play.
USC will look to rebound in conference play as it travels to Pauley Pavilion on Saturday to take on No. 10 UCLA. The Trojans will be looking for a big upset of a top 10-ranked opponent and its fifth consecutive victory over the Bruins.

In a quick turn of events, the No. 9 USC men’s tennis team moved their Friday afternoon doubleheader against University of San Francisco and UC Davis to Thursday evening because of inclement weather set to arrive. Still, a quick schedule change was unable to stop the surging Trojans as they claimed swift victories before next week’s ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Charlottesville, Virginia. 
The Trojans were able to etch out 6-1 wins over the visiting universities at Marks Stadium. The men quickly came out ahead against San Francisco by nabbing quick doubles points. No. 35 pairing senior Nick Crystal and sophomore Laurens Verboven defeated the Dons’ duo of Christian Brockstedt and Oliver Poysti by way of 6-1. Shortly after teammates senior Rob Bellamy and sophomore Jack Jaede secured another victory and the Trojans’ first points on a 6-2 decision against Paul Giraud and Woravin Kumthonkittikul. 
In singles against the Dons, USC pieced together three straight-set wins to clinch victory. Freshman Riley Smith started things off against Brockstedt with a 6-1, 6-1 win on court four. Meanwhile, No. 119 Jaede matched the same score against Poysti on court three. Verboven secured the clincher over Giraud by way of 6-1, 6-4 victory. Junior Thibault Forget allowed the Dons to score their first and only points of the afternoon before No. 36 sophomore Logan Smith defeated Johan Joehagen 7-5, 2-6, 1-0 (10-6) to put the Trojans back up. Junior Jens Sweaney fought off a match point to win out against Kumthonkittikul 4-6, 7-6, 1-0 (10-7) and secure a Trojans victory.
UC Davis saw action shortly after a decisive Trojans victory. Once again USC’s double play allowed for an early advantage with freshman duo Brandon Holt and Smith quickly winning 6-1 over David Goulak and Tommy Lam. Senior Nick Crystal and redshirt junior David Laser won 6-2 to put the Trojans on the board first. Five straight singles victories followed doubles play and ultimately allow USC to win 6-1.
Bellamy and Crystal registered 6-1, 6-2 and 6-2, 6-2 victories respectively against Goulak and Alec Adamson. Holt set up for the clincher with a 6-2, 6-2 win against Bryce McKelvie. Smith’s 6-3, 6-2 victory over Everett Maltby allowed Forget to avenge his earlier loss by way of comeback against James Wade 1-6, 6-2, 1-0 (10-4). Junior Henry Ji was the Trojans’ only loss of the late evening affair as he dropped 6-3, 6-4 sets against Max Pham.
“We played with great energy under the lights,” head coach Peter Smith said. “It was great to see the guys play hard and get some good matches in. Big thanks to USF and UC Davis for playing a day early.”
The Trojans will now head out to Virginia this weekend as they will compete at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships. In the past the Trojans have competed against crosstown rival UCLA as well as cross country opponents such as Ohio State, UNC and Wake Forest.

USC’s loss on Saturday night to Oregon perfectly captures the current state of the men’s basketball program. The Trojans have climbed their way out of the conference basement cellar and are now entrenched as a respectable upper-tier — but not yet elite — team in the Pac-12.
Saturday night proved this as the Trojans went toe-to-toe with Oregon for about 35 minutes of the game before turnovers, poor shooting and a lack of physical play underneath ultimately doomed them.
This performance was significantly more impressive than the clunker the Trojans turned in at Matthew Knight Arena to close out 2016, but it still showed the Trojans have some work left to do to advance to the upper echelon of the conference and cement themselves as a top-20 national program.
This certainly should not be taken as a complaint with head coach Andy Enfield’s work thus far.
Except for a few strong years under Tim Floyd, this is the best the USC program has been over the last decade and a half. Enfield has consistently improved the team, stockpiling talent each year and making incremental improvements to solidify USC as an NCAA tournament team.
As someone who remembers a painfully empty Galen Center during a way-too-close-for-comfort win against Northern Arizona in Enfield’s inaugural season, the last season and a half have been incredible to watch. 
Now, it is about taking the next step forward and consistently competing with Oregon, UCLA and Arizona — and figuring out a way to beat Utah as well.
Saturday was a game where, despite brief spurts, the Trojans went cold from beyond the arc.
While this is surmountable in games against inferior opponents, the Trojans as they are currently constructed need hot shooting to win games against elite opponents. 
So far in their marquee matchups, USC has only come out firing on all cylinders once, which was in their win against UCLA. Otherwise, the Trojans don’t have a fluid enough half-court offense to create points like a disciplined Virginia or Wisconsin team might.
Enfield is spot on in his vision to build a winning program outside of the one and done model that only works if you have a strong basketball brand or visionary coach. Outside of Duke and Kentucky, no one else can seem to make that work. The best way to compete for every other team, the Trojans included, is to recruit talented players, who won’t leave after their first season, and develop them to fit a multitude of systems.
The Trojans are reaping the rewards of this process with the development of juniors Elijah Stewart and Jordan McLaughlin as well as sophomore Chimezie Metu, and, to a lesser extent because of limited playing time, Bennie Boatwright. These players were highly touted recruits in the Los Angeles area, and by closing in on them Enfield built the foundation of the program.
This same model appears to be paying dividends with freshmen De’Anthony Melton and Jonah Matthews as well, who both appear to have extremely bright futures.
The Trojans have this foundation, but they are missing two elements that would crystallize Enfield’s vision and lead to closer games against opponents like Oregon and Arizona. The Trojans need a strong, sturdy low post presence and more consistent shooters.
When redshirt sophomore guard Shaqquan Aaron and Stewart are making shots from deep, the Trojans are practically unbeatable. In general, it seems when Aaron is on, the Trojans are one of the best teams in the country. However, while Aaron is certainly an excellent talent, he is not a knockdown shooter, and neither is Stewart. In order to win consistently in big games, USC needs to find one or two more guys like Boatwright and Matthews, who have strong fundamentals and a fluid stroke. 
Looking across town, it is clear that the ability to space the floor has helped UCLA immensely.
When a team has four to six players who shoot it exceptionally well from 3-point territory, it is highly unlikely they will all go cold in the same game.
The second thing the Trojans need is a bruiser. The Trojans were hurt by the loss of Nikola Jovanovic, who might have played this role, but even he struggled against physical big men inside. Without shooting, the Trojans offense goes stagnant, which is exacerbated when talented brutes like Oregon’s Jordan Bell dominate the glass on both the offensive and defensive end. This has been the Trojans’ undoing against Utah and Arizona, and if the team isn’t hitting 3-point shots and getting out in transition, they struggle to win because of this lack of frontcourt strength.
The Trojans can work on both of these elements moving forward. The team has been extremely dependable this season, winning all the games it should. The next step in turning the Trojans into the elite program they have the potential to be is finding shooters and a big man, and going toe to toe against teams like Oregon in every matchup.

The unranked men’s volleyball team fell in three sets to No. 3 BYU on Friday, but it was not as easy of a victory as some might have thought if they casually glanced at the matchup on paper. 
Ultimately, almost all of BYU’s players on the court contributed to make every play look like a perfect dig, an on-target set and point-earning kill.
“If they pass great, the advantage is definitely on their side of the net simply by virtue that they have a strong attacker in every position,” head coach Jeff Nygaard said before the game.
Both BYU and USC started the game missing key players. For the Trojans, rising transfer outside hitter Gianluca Grasso, who has been putting up consistent, strong numbers since joining the team a few weeks ago, was out due to a sprained ankle. His absence was clearly felt as USC was only able to put up 36 total kills to BYU’s 45. 
For the Cougars, junior opposite and kill leader Ben Patch had to miss the game for an undisclosed injury, but missing Patch did not keep BYU from staying strong across the front.
BYU opposite Tim Dobbert and outside hitter Jake Langlois put up a combined 23 kills, with Dobbert hitting at .500 percent. The team also maintained their consistency with the help of libero Erik Sikes’ match-leading 12 digs and middle blocker Price Jarman’s match-best five blocks.
“I’m happy for the guys and their performance as a team,” BYU head coach Shawn Olmstead said. “Tim did a great job tonight, and Jake was aggressive in all areas. It was good to get some reps for the others as well, and they did a good job in that role.”
The game started out with USC taking control and leading 11-5 in the first set. The Trojans were in rhythm and appeared to be playing with ease. However, BYU slowly crept back and duked it out with the Trojans at the net to eventually take the set with three consecutive points to end it 27-25. 
From there, BYU surged ahead with USC right on its heels, but it would be the Cougars again that pulled ahead far enough that USC couldn’t catch them at the end of the second set. 
By the third set, BYU had hit its stride and held the lead for the entirety of the set to finish out the game with the victory.
Across the board, the Cougars outdid the Trojans in almost every category. They ended by hitting .352 to USC’s .168, nine blocks to four, 36 digs to the Trojans’ 27 and four aces to one. 
Part of this could be attributed to their predominantly upperclassmen starters, who have been with the program and in the system for longer than the Trojans’ younger team. 
“The more mature you are,” Nygaard said, “the more experience you have, the more comfortable you are in your own skin and the more comfortable you are with whatever is thrown your way.” 
What kind of reporting is this where you don’t give the scores of the 2nd & 3rd sets. Coach Nygaard has done absolutely nothing in two years at the helm. One or two top recruits can make a big difference even as freshmen. Time for a change in leadership at the top.

“I’m a loser, baby / so why don’t you kill me?”
This refrain, from Beck’s 1993 hit “Loser,” was a memorable lyric from the artist’s concert last Friday at the Hollywood Palladium. Beck’s claim of being a “loser” may seem strange today — 24 years after writing this song as a homeless musician, he has now beaten Beyoncé for a Grammy, been covered by Johnny Cash and created Sea Change and Odelay, works that have been widely accepted as two of the greatest albums of all time. However, his claim on the title “loser” remains fitting, for Beck still uses his music to identify with outcasts through his eclectic lyrics and experimental style.
Reveling in musical eccentricity, Beck led a concert that was a mishmash of genres, including funk, hip-hop, rock and folk. However, all the songs exhibited his signature alternative flavor:  Rock tracks like “Soul of a Man,” “E-Pro” and “Devil’s Haircut” stirred the audience into a frenzy with their squalling guitars and pounding drums, whereas the funky “Sexx Laws” had everyone dancing while the psychedelic “Black Tambourine” coaxed some audience members to light up a joint.
To balance out the high-octane evening (“but don’t calm down too much,” Beck said with a smile), the artist showcased his signature folk in the mesmerizing melodies of “Lost Cause.” Overall, it was a perfect mix of head-bangers and softer pieces that allowed audience members to breathe.
The artist’s freewheeling style resulted in a casual atmosphere, and Beck and his band improvised tributes to numerous artists, including David Bowie, Michael Jackson and Prince; they even merged their song “Where It’s At” with the Beatles classic “Strawberry Fields Forever.” 
The Palladium’s structure allowed the audience to crowd around the stage, granting Beck opportunities to interact closely with his fans. He good-naturedly accepted requests ranging from “Paper Tiger” to the Brazilian-inspired tune “Tropicalia.” The band’s relaxed, joyful demeanor, as well as the palpable love of their fans, created a fun-filled atmosphere and an intimate connection between artist and audience.
The concert also solidified Beck’s reputation as an impeccable performer. His instrumental abilities were on full display: He showcased his riveting harmonica skills during the bluegrass-inspired “Fourteen Rivers Fourteen Floods” and jammed out on his guitar with the  Jack White-co-written tune “Go It Alone.”
Though Beck’s vocal range is limited, his lyricism and the passionate vocals almost defy criticism; he poured his soul into songs like “Think I’m In Love” and “Blue Moon,” leaving little doubt about the deep connection he has to his music.
Beck’s roots in Hollywood resulted in a concert steeped in genuine commitment to the area. The Los Angeles-born artist paused to reminisce about how Hollywood shaped his artistic identity. He also pointed out how the studio where he recorded many songs was only three blocks away — although that was “back when Hollywood was not the place you should walk around,” the artist noted.
Not only did Beck perform “Qué Onda Guero,” a song about growing up in the multicultural East Los Angeles, but he also invited the choir of the nonprofit Urban Entertainment Institute to perform with him, led by Compton native and constant collaborator Fred Martin. 
The group of young, primarily African American women performed with him for most of the show, singing the gospel song “Like a Ship (Without a Sail)” in the “stand-up-in-church-and-cry-Hallelujah” spirit as the smiling audience clapped along. 
It was the night’s most powerful performance; it portrayed a message of hope and perseverance that Beck noted was especially “appropriate for these times.” Throughout the night, the artist continued to push a positive atmosphere, crying “If you love your life, say yeah!” during his Chance the Rapper-inspired song “Wow.”
At the end of the night, when Beck shouted “I’ve found some friends tonight,” the sentiment rang true. He and his band had turned out a brilliant performance, entertaining everyone with their stellar music and most importantly, connecting deeply with their fans and the community at large.

Last November, I tried coming out to my mom. It didn’t work out.
For the past year and a half, I’ve been facing the same dilemma of whether or not I should come out to my family. I’m proud of my sexual orientation, and I’m glad to say that I have people in my life who accept me, but this hasn’t been the case with my parents.
For many young Asian Americans, conflict of identity is not a strange occurrence. As the son of two Vietnamese immigrants, I can attest that it has taken a very long journey to get to where I am today.
I grew up loving my heritage and culture. After coming to America, my parents continued to hold on to their values — Vietnamese cultural values that they used to raise me and my older brother. It meant greeting my relatives whenever they came to visit. It meant no English inside the house. It meant waiting for all your elders to eat before you could start picking up your chopsticks. And it also meant that romance should strictly be between a man and a woman.
I’ve been doing a lot of thinking about my future for the past couple of months. When I came back home to Little Saigon for Thanksgiving break, I felt like it would be the right time. My boyfriend and I were discussing the possibility of coming out to our parents during that period. I even asked my brother for advice. Both of them agreed that no matter what happened, my parents would still love me.
While I knew it was true, I could not fathom the shock that would come if I came out to them about my sexuality and my lifestyle differences. As my co-editor Terry Nguyen said in last week’s column, “I was living under a different ‘bi’ label my entire life.”
I have always been bicultural, and the intersectional struggle of my identities created a conflict between my sexuality and the culture I was brought up in.
For a very long time, I had been struggling to come to terms with my sexuality and gender identity. And when I finally overcame that struggle, a new one arose. I didn’t know how to balance the difference between who I am to my family and who I am to the rest of the world.
My parents don’t understand the concept of bisexuality — because from their cultural lens, there is only a simple binary in love, relationships and family building. Without this understanding, I also wouldn’t be able to tell them of where I stand on the Kinsey scale as a male-leaning bisexual.
Despite all the qualms I had, I knew I wanted to give my parents a chance — a chance for them to finally understand a part of my life that I had hid from the two people I loved the most.
So on Thanksgiving day, I had a moment with my mom. She and I were talking about my future, where I wanted to work, what career aspiration I had — and the conversation came up.
“Mom… what if I like both boys and girls? Is that OK?” I asked. She chuckled a bit.
“I don’t think that’s possible, and I wouldn’t support it,” she said. “I want to you to grow up into the world as a man so people don’t laugh at you. You know it’s true that gay people live a hard life, especially in our community.”
It hurt to hear her dismiss my thoughts so quickly and instantaneously. But I understood and knew that she wasn’t ready for it. And nor was I for everything that I thought I had been ready for.
As much pain as I was in at the time, I know now that I still have a long way to go before things will change for the better. I’m still thinking of ways to overcome the cultural barriers that lie between me and my Vietnamese parents. I know that in order for them to finally understand me, I have to have a better understanding of my own identity and where I stand in comparison to my parents in terms of our cultural differences. And hopefully at that point, things will get easier.
I’m currently writing this column with hopes that one day, I’ll be strong enough to share these thoughts with my parents. I’m also stuck at the crossroads, but I know one day, I’ll be able to choose my own path. And somehow, some way, everything will be OK.
Allen Pham is a sophomore majoring in public relations. He is also the lifestyle editor of the Daily Trojan. His column, “The A Game,” runs every other Monday.
Sometimes the only way to change a community is to come out to that community. Good luck in changing hearts and minds – including your parent’s. It’s not as hard as you might think.

Through the doors of the USC Fisher Museum of Art, a spacious gallery boasts pieces that, at first glance, seem to have no connection with each other. The center of the installation is a painting of a fruit stand on a wooden panel, its background adorned with gold leaf. At the top was the title of the exhibition: Miracles Unknown.
Upon first glance, a fruit stand offers no significance to the abstract principles of miracles and the unknown. A fruit is a mundane object — the antithesis of the unknown — but through these everyday objects, the curators of this exhibition attempted to channel a sense of mysticism surrounding commonplace items like fruit.
Seniors Lauren Jones and Yomyung Regina Chung, junior Madelyne Gordon and and sophomore Antonia Jade Matias-Bell worked with Fisher Museum Director Selma Holo to tackle what these two subject matters mean. After a week of browsing through catalogs from previous exhibitions at the Fisher Museum’s permanent collection and choosing some initial artworks, the art history majors decided upon the theme and located the artworks.
“Throughout this process we were working on our wall text and trying to verbalize what our theme was,” said Chung. “And the last step was, we hung them up.”
The first half of the installation discusses the miracles individuals encounter everyday and often take for granted; the other half examines the unknown of everyday existence, an unfamiliar and scary concept that is simultaneously awe-inspiring.
Bell and Chung teamed up to show the existence of miracles through a section titled “Everyday Miracles.” The exhibits include a variety of artistic works: A two-part photograph of an artist’s hands, an oil painting of a shipwreck, a plexiglass depicting a winged dinosaur flying out of the La Brea Tar Pits and a series of photographs by Christina Fernandez, which illustrates her grandmother’s journey from Mexico to San Diego, Calif. At first glance, the artworks appear unrelated to each other, but the overarching theme of everyday miracles created cohesion and started a conversation about the definition of a miracle.
“We didn’t want to just deal with miracles in the sense that we think of them as being mythical or out of reach, but something that actually has already been here … like the choice of our works that have already been with the USC Fisher Museum,” Chung said.
According to Chung, miracles already exist in daily life but are rarely recognized. The “Everyday Miracles” installation intends to portray a search for commonplace miracles and the mature perceptions of individuals once they realize this precious phenomenon.
Gordon and Jones worked on the second part of the exhibit, which was named “Unknown.” The exhibit started with a two-part photograph of a family called “En Circulo I” by Mira Bernabeu. The first photograph depicts a large family in a dark auditorium. The second photograph shows the same family in an almost identical pose, but there was a stark difference: They are without their clothes. Like “En Circulo I,” all parts of the exhibition raised questions that bring out the unknown in daily life.
The installation frames the uncertainties of life through the lens of an artist: how art can be used as a way to identify the unknown and to present the artist’s reaction. It can be an attempt to reach a solution, but it can also be the artist trying to figure out how they feel about the unknown. “We decided together to use the show as an opportunity to explore what we consider the unknown, especially in this current time that we’ve entered where access to healthcare is unknown, people’s immigration status is unknown, gender identity, personal identity … all these questions that sometimes we don’t have the answer to,” Gordon said.
One artwork stood out as a commentary to today’s turbulent times: a silver print by Loren Sandvik depicting a bloodied woman holding her baby, set in a background of pitch black. Called “Lucy Alamillo and Maia Ixchel Ramirez,” the picture was taken in 2000 as the artist’s way to comment on immigration in the United States. The basis of immigration and border protection contains a plethora of uncertainties, but it is the reality of life for many.
“Especially after the travel ban that Trump has issued in his executive order, the photograph is still relevant today, 17 years later,” Gordon said. 
At the center of the exhibit stood the “Fruit Stand” painting. It displays common themes found within Miracles Unknown. 
“We decided to share this central painting because … [of the] common ground between the two themes that we independently came up with,” Gordon said. “[It] happened to work really well together,”
“The Fruit Stand” by Robert Glen Ginder channels Byzantine-era art style, but instead of depicting the usual subject matter of Madonna-and-Child, the artist chose to paint a fruit stand. The juxtaposition between this everyday object and the traditional theme of miracles shows that, to the artist, miracles exist in everyday life.

This past week, deportations and raids led by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement turned Los Angeles from a city of hope into one of fear and uncertainty. Almost 200 undocumented Angelenos were detained and deported. 
Daily Trojan
Los deportó la migra. Chills go down my back when I hear those words. The sheer thought that mi mamá y mi papá could be arrested and separated from me is one that has haunted me since I was small child. As a 10-year-old, I remember watching Univision and seeing hundreds of people like my family being raided and deported. My mom would hold a rosary in her hand, praying to la Virgen de Guadalupe, to protect us. My dad would go to work with his head down, scared that la migra might show up to his work and round up his construction co-workers. 
Texas, Georgia, New York and North and South Carolina have seen these raids in 2017 after President Donald Trump took office. Trump is doing what he promised: rounding up the “illegal aliens” and sending them back. But he’s not making America great again; he’s separating families and leaving American children without their parents.
Here at USC, we live in a gentrified bubble. We are divided from Los Angeles by virtual gates of misconception and entitlement. We fail to realize that there are high school kids down the street, workers at your favorite Mexican restaurant and even some of your classmates who live in constant fear of a family member being deported. With a presidential administration that won’t directly affect the majority of this school’s population, there are people like me, who don’t know if their parents will be snatched from their homes and sent to a country they barely even remember.
The vast majority of the undocumented people in this country are not criminals — they’re people with dreams. They’re people who are willing to take risks. They’re people who came to this country to find a future for their children. Now, hundreds of them are being separated from their families. For my parents, it’s been over 20 years since they stepped foot in their native Durango, Mexico. But with Trump, our fear that they could be deported is more real than ever.
It’s 2017, and we’re back to hiding in the shadows. The fear of my parents’ deportation has always existed, but now, the possibility of them getting sent back is more likely now than it ever has been.
Last week, a mother named Guadalupe García was deported from Arizona and separated from her two children for using a fake social security number in order to get a job. She came into this country to give her two kids a better life and a future that would have never existed back home. 
The woman’s name is Guadalupe, just like la Virgen of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico. With her brown skin and black hair, she symbolizes the struggle and the unending hope of the Mexican people who live in the United States. 
Guadalupe García, or Lupita, represents a similar struggle. She is an echo of all of the Mexican mothers who live in the United States without papers. She is the symbol of risk and the definition of hard work. She is my mamá. She is my tía. She is my madrina. She is the definition of the undocumented Latina who risks everything for her children.
La Virgen de Guadalupe was known to say, “Am I not here, that I am your mother?” to Juan Diego, explaining to this poor, indigenous man that he would never be alone, as she would always be there. Now, Lupita won’t be able to be there for her two children anymore, like la Virgen de Guadalupe said she would be for us. Lupita is now separated from her children by an already-existing wall.
The problems nationwide are real, and they are constant, but things can be done locally to protect our community, even here on campus. It’s time that the school’s administration take action to prevent Trump’s xenophobia from affecting the Trojan community and its surrounding areas. The University must declare itself a sanctuary for undocumented students and workers and use its billionaire budget to provide resources for the families who fear deportation surrounding our campus.

Sadly, Trump’s contentious issue is yet one more that makes being an international student difficult, on top of our already complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   One such new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.    
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study or wherever you come from, because that is the TRUE spirit of the American PEOPLE, not a few in government who have the loudest voice!

In the dead of night two weeks ago, thousands of volunteers, including USC students and faculty, hit the streets of Los Angeles for the Homeless Count, an annual service event. Based on last year’s census, on any given night, over 80,000 Angelenos sleep on the streets. That’s nearly twice USC’s total undergraduate and graduate population. But the problem is a lot more personal than a simple statistic. It’s personal when you see tents lined up underneath the nearby underpass, when someone on Figueroa Street begs you for some change or some food. It’s also an issue that affects many students, such as the 13 percent of community college students who are homeless. The rising costs of tuition and housing force them to live out of cars or friend’s apartments.
We all have defining experiences with homeless individuals that shape our perception of some of the most marginalized people in our society. For me, though I’ve been heckled and had food thrown at me, I’ve also received some of life’s best advice from someone in a shelter and have met some of the most resilient, creative, hopeful and inspiring people on the streets. We cannot limit our experiences with homeless people to hurried glances or pitiful expressions — otherwise we run the risk of succumbing to the notion that some people are too far gone to save.
Sometimes it takes a donation to save a life, but sometimes it only takes a smile to brighten one. To even begin eradicating the plague of homelessness, we need to first expand our capacity to empathize with those that we fear and don’t understand. It’s easy to walk by the huddled masses on the corner. It’s easy to look away and move on.  But it’s hard to overcome apathy. It’s hard to overcome stigma. Yet inaction can no longer be our course of action.
Los Angeles as a city has begun to rise to the challenge. Ballot Measure HHH last November secured $1 billion to invest in housing for the homeless, and Measure H on March 7 seeks to allocate sales tax revenue to services that rehabilitate the homeless.
But as students and citizens, we have a role to play as well. On Feb. 27, Homelessness Awareness Week at USC, hosted by USC’s newly formed Homelessness Action Committee, will provide opportunities to gain knowledge on how to join the cause. The student organization Share a Meal hits the streets twice a week to serve burritos to the homeless people in our backyard. And the University itself this past year unveiled a multi-pronged initiative to tackle homelessness through professional schools such as the USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and with community partners and the city itself.
But this is only where our activism begins, not ends. Even if we lack the time and means to volunteer with a local nonprofit or advocate for the passing of Measure H, we can still work to humanize homelessness on a personal level and on a daily basis. By offering to buy food for those who call Figueroa street home or by taking a minute to engage in a simple conversation with someone on the street, we validate the humanity of those whom we are prone to ignore and forget. By having the conviction to challenge the apathy and stigma we encounter within ourselves or in others, we can begin to change the dominating, pessimistic narrative surrounding homelessness.  Ultimately, the first step in addressing a problem isn’t seeing that a problem exists, but rather realizing that real humans suffer from it.
Homelessness is often seen as some inextricable problem with so many causes and failed solutions that it seems inevitable that some Americans will line the streets every night. But it’s neither necessary nor normal for human beings not to have a place to call home. It’s neither moral nor acceptable for our most marginalized population to be left behind as we walk by their sleeping bags and tents.
But it’s not too late to change course. These people may be homeless, but they are far from hopeless. We students directly may not have created the problem, but we each must play a part in ending it.

A late comeback attempt from USC was shut down by No. 5 Oregon Saturday night, as the Ducks topped the Trojans by a score of 81-70 at the Galen Center.
With 2:40 remaining in regulation, junior guard Elijah Stewart knocked down a 3-point shot that pulled the Trojans within three points of the Ducks.
Oregon responded by closing the game out on a 10-2 run over the final two minutes of regulation to clinch its 14th consecutive victory against USC. The Trojans have dropped their last seven games against the Ducks in Los Angeles, and they haven’t beat Oregon at home since the 2009 season. 
The Trojans finished the game by missing their last four shot attempts in the contest; USC made no field goals over the final 2:40 of regulation.
“That was a tough game. We played hard, but not well enough to win,” head coach Andy Enfield said. “Our guards were off tonight in their decision making and shooting. To beat a top-five team in the country, you have to play better.”
Poor shooting from the field was a struggle for USC all night Saturday. The Trojans finished the game shooting 22-for-59 (37.3 percent).
USC’s shooting woes may have been most evident from beyond the 3-point line. In the first half, USC shot 2-of-15 (13.3 percent) from beyond the arc. Overall, the Trojans shot 6-for-27 (22.2 percent) from distance.
“When you’re 6-for-27 from three and a lot were wide open and you miss three dunks, it’s hard to beat a team like this,” Enfield said.
A layup from sophomore forward Bennie Boatwright gave USC its largest lead of the night against Oregon, as the Trojans led 49-46 with just over 13 minutes remaining.
“Tonight shows our growth. It shows we can play with anybody,” said freshman guard De’Anthony Melton, who finished with nine points and two steals Saturday. “We need to learn how to close out games.”
As was the case for many USC shooters Saturday night, Boatwright had his share of struggles from the field. Boatwright finished the game shooting 3-of-15 (20 percent), but he did hit all eight of his free throws to finish with 15 points against Oregon.
Leading the way for the Trojans was sophomore forward Chimezie Metu, who recorded a team-high 16 points Saturday. Metu finished 6-of-8 from the field while reeling in four rebounds and dishing three assists.
“We have to protect the ball. We had too many turnovers,” said Stewart, who totaled 15 points on 5-of-10 shooting.
USC committed a total of 16 turnovers against the Ducks after averaging 11.1 turnovers per game entering Saturday. Oregon capitalized on Trojan mistakes, as the Ducks outscored USC in points off turnovers, 23-12.
Oregon junior forward Dillon Brooks finished with a game-high 21 points on 8-of-14 shooting. Brooks was 3-of-5 shooting from deep against the Trojans.
Brooks finished as the game’s leading scorer despite fouling out with 3:28 remaining in regulation.
Oregon sophomore guard Tyler Dorsey scored 19 points (6-of-13 shooting) and recorded five rebounds. Ducks junior forward Jordan Bell finished with a game-high 14 rebounds; he recorded a double-double as he also scored 12 points Saturday.
Overall, Oregon edged USC on the glass by a margin of 39-34.
With the loss, the Trojans were unable to avenge their 84-61 loss to the Ducks earlier this season on Dec. 30. USC has never upset an opponent ranked in the top five nationally at the Galen Center.
Saturday’s loss also put an end to the Trojan’s five-game winning streak in Pac-12 play.
USC will look to rebound in conference play as it travels to Pauley Pavilion on Saturday to take on No. 10 UCLA. The Trojans will be looking for a big upset of a top 10-ranked opponent and its fifth consecutive victory over the Bruins.
