In the moonlit veins of Kamathipura, a notorious district of Mumbai peppered with Parsi cafes and secondhand bookstores, Indian director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s “Gangubai Kathiawadi” (2022) unearths an abundance of life.
With street vendors wailing prices of Banta Soda before a lavish New Roshan Talkies theater and the scent of Nalli Nihari inundating every crowded bylane, Kamathipura drips with an old-world charm in every frame, delicately laden with memories of a golden age. Beholding the fractured years of the 1950s through cinematographer Sudeep Chatterjee’s lens, each nuanced set is bathed in this fairytale-like quality. 
However, “Gangubai Kathiawadi” never begins once upon a time. 
Adapted from “The Matriarch of Kamathipura,” a chapter from S. Hussain Zaidi and Jane Borges’ book, “Mafia Queens of Mumbai,” Bhansali’s newest film chronicles a tightly-woven tale of the lives of sex workers in a red-light district of Mumbai. On that theme, the film’s opening shot reveals a disturbing close-up of a young girl who was recently sold to human traffickers, smothered with cosmetics for an unsettling customer.
This sets up the haunting tone that consumes this movie. Foregrounded by the echoes of Mirza Ghalib’s ghazal: “Yeh na thi hamari qismat” (This was not my destiny), her gut-wrenching shrieks are drowned out by the din of passing trains, as Bhansali and his co-writer Utkarshini Vashishtha indict their audience for turning a blind eye to abuse — in lanes not too far from our own, to people not unlike ourselves.
In wielding this compelling narrative, the story urges our empathetic gaze to linger even further, as the life of the young girl is mirrored by the protagonist, Gangubai Harjivandas Kathiawadi (Alia Bhatt). All-consumed by the world of Hindi cinema and entangled in her own dreams of stardom, Ganga is the naive daughter of a venerated barrister in Kathiawad, who falls prey to the exploitation of her suitor.
Lured to the big city under the pretext of a promised role in a Bollywood film alongside star Dev Anand, Ganga finds herself stranded in Sheila Masi’s (Seema Pahwa) local brothel, chained to her destiny and oblivious to being trafficked into sex work by a man she loved, Ramnik Lal (Varun Kapoor). Somehow, the endless horizons of Kathiawad melt into the four walls of Kamathipura, as they choke Ganga into finding a home in the cracks of the forlorn city. 
In a spine-tingling scene where the electricity supply of the neighborhood is cut off, the gallis are lit up by the dwindling radiance of handheld candles. The narrow street is strewn with hints of yellow flickers that accentuate the bodies of the brothel women as objects of desire, who struggle to lure customers into their abode of closed doors. In many ways, this scene exhibits the necessities of their survival, lending it the ethereality that defines the bloodcurdling aesthetic of Sanjay Leela Bhansali. It is here, in the shadows of the darkness, that Ganga sheds her old skin and steps into herself as Gangu, a milestone on her journey to becoming Gangubai Kathiawadi: president of Kamathipura and advocate for sex workers.
In “Gangubai,” Bhansali reveals a throbbing heart. In tandem with his stylistic approach, each carefully choreographed scene placed within a divinely-crafted set spills out of the borders of the screen into the real world. It absorbs its beholders into the lanes of Kamathipura, translating viewers from a mere pair of eyes into stakeholders in the protracted fight for justice.
Although flesh and bones on characters like Gangu’s rakhi brother Rahim Lala (Ajay Devgn) and archnemesis Raziabai (Vijay Raaz) are scant, as broken pieces in Bhansali’s puzzle, they seem to fit just right. Beyond these extravagantly lackluster sets and their cesspool of characters, however, “Gangubai Kathiawadi” — a genre-bending creation in a male-dominated industry — finds an indescribable comfort in Alia Bhatt. 
Draped in a swan-white saree against the sunless backdrop of Kamathipura, Bhatt is floodlit with desire. Her youthful features coupled with a rich baritone and black sunglasses offer an incorrigible swagger to her character, bringing “Gangubai” to life with ease. Each delicately painted scene is clotted with a whirlwind of emotions that is complemented with Bhatt’s tailor-made expressions; her eyes, which convey sentiments that shoulder the film’s poetic dialogue-baazi, are marvelously strung together with its lyricism.
For this reason, the audience finds itself filtering through a gamut of emotions, often caught between an intense tear-jerker and a one-line comic relief masterfully delivered by Bhatt. Imbuing layers of mortality to her character that is unfounded in any script, Alia’s “Gangubai” is revolutionary beyond words, with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s rose being the exception in her garden of thorns. 
In Bhansali’s profound universe, the soundtrack bleeds seamlessly into the film, the characters breathe in syncopation, and the beholder is left with a fragment of infinity that outlives even “Gangubai Kathiawadi.” In the snug silences that conjunct the dialogues, her gaze meets the eye, a bidi rests in the crevices of her lips and her resemblance to the moon permeates the film: “Gangu chand thi aur chand hi rahegi.”
Lost in the midst of a once upon a time and a happily ever after, Bhansali’s Kamathipura is not fraught with princesses, only a mafia queen.

While Gale Sinatra taught a reading comprehension class at the University of Utah, she witnessed how some of her students struggled to relate to the topic of evolution because the science contradicted many of their families’ beliefs. These difficulties became a topic she would attempt to embark on her extensive research journey.
“I was really surprised and taken [back] by that,” Sinatra said. “That studying science is hard to begin with for some people, and then, it gets more complicated as there’s different aspects of it that people struggle with, from an emotional standpoint or from an identity standpoint.” 
Sinatra, the Stephen H. Crocker Professor of Education at the Rossier School of Education, saw the importance of understanding why many teachers encountered similar issues when it came to controversial scientific topics such as evolution and climate change. With her educational background in psychology, much of Sinatra’s work focuses on identifying these educational roadblocks and assisting educators with their methods of covering these complex topics with their students.
Because of her many years of research and efforts, the National Academy of Education recently elected Sinatra into the organization, a selection she said she is honored and grateful for. Sinatra said she is excited about the National Academy’s mission of improving educational practices and policies and wishes to improve the Academy in any way she can. 
“I hope I can get the National Academy to support more initiatives in climate change education,” Sinatra said. “I do not believe we’ve done a good job in K-12 education in supporting climate change education.”
In addition to the Academy’s recognition, colleagues and students, such as Imogen Herrick, commended Sinatra’s contributions to her fields of study.
“It just demonstrates what an awesome impact she’s had in educational psychology and science education to be selected as such an elite group. It’s almost like a stamp of approval that you’ve truly made an impact on the world,” said Herrick, a doctoral candidate studying urban education policy. Sinatra currently acts as Herrick’s advisor in the PhD program.
Lawrence Picus, associate dean for research and faculty affairs at Rossier, met Sinatra ten years ago at USC and has worked with her on various projects. He said that he supports Sinatra’s attitude toward her research and position at the University. 
“From the very beginning, she was collegial,” Picus said. “She worked with other people. She wanted to be part of the fabric of Rossier and just [has] always been willing to do things and do whatever we needed.”
Sinatra said she finds many of the issues that result in science denial and misunderstanding come from the lack of proper guidance on complex scientific topics. Because of this confusion and lack of direction, people rely on each other for explanations rather than experts on the subject.
“When you don’t understand something about science, then all your emotions and motivations and maybe your identity, your political affiliations, those tend to sort of fill the gap of knowledge,” Sinatra said. 
In addition to her future work with the National Academy, Sinatra has some recent accomplishments related to her research. Sinatra co-authored a book titled “Science Denial: Why It Happens & What to Do About It” with Barbara Hofer, a psychology professor at Middlebury College, in which she further explains the importance of assisting educators with their classrooms and what leads to misinformation.
Additionally, Sinatra and Herrick are working on a project at the La Brea Tar Pits exploring the capabilities of augmented reality and its capability to teach others. 
“I think our goals are to build an augmented reality exhibit that helps to do that, that helps people learn science and helps to recover ideas that maybe aren’t fully correct, and help them to find the correct understanding,” Herrick said. 
Sinatra will continue with her research and projects on education and will be formally inducted into the National Academy of Education at a Washington D.C. meeting in November.

After hearing about the free vegan meals offered at the USC Office of Religious and Spiritual Life courtyard through a group chat for QuestBridge recipients, Hyewon Choi, a sophomore majoring in communication, began attending the Jubilee Vegan Café regularly. 
Attendees of the cafe are greeted by Rev. Sunny Kang at a sign in table decorated with informational pamphlets on the environmental and spiritual benefits of a plant-based diet. Once they register with their name and email address, they’re encouraged to grab their free meal and sit among other attendees throughout the courtyard. At each table are students gathered around, eating, working and talking.
Choi said she was surprised at how welcoming the cafe is to students and had not seen an outreach program like this during her time at USC.
“I have seen USC giving food during midterm or final week, but I haven’t seen this consistently,” Choi said. 
To make the Jubilee Vegan Café happen, the Progressive Christians at USC teamed up with Vegans of Los Angeles and the USC Office of Religious and Spiritual Life to provide free weekly vegan meals to all members and registered guests.
Meals are provided at the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life Courtyard every Wednesday from noon to 1:30 p.m. Membership is open to all students, regardless of religious affiliation, and is free under the condition that members volunteer at least once a semester to set up and help cook the meals.
According to the United University Church’s website, the purpose of Jubilee Vegan Café is to “provide quality vegan food to support vegan students, staff, and faculty,” “promote vegan food and plant-based lifestyle among students, staff, and faculty” and to “educate and promote animal rights.”  At the weekly lunches’ sign-in table, attendees can learn more about the environmental, spiritual and health benefits of a plant-based lifestyle through distributed pamphlets.
While the cafe gets established, the UUC provided food prepared by a caterer, but later in the semester, Senior Associate Dean of Religious Life Rev. Jim Burklo said that the cafe plans to launch a co-op by involving student members in cooking and serving the meals. The students at Progressive Christians at USC will cook alongside Jubilee Vegan Cafée members.
Previously, the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life worked with UUC to host the Good Karma Cafe. Established about 12 years ago, the Good Karma Cafe served as an accommodation for students who follow a vegetarian diet for a religious reason, and later developed into what Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni described as “an amazing place of community” where students could go meet new people.
“What we saw is that we really started it as a food accommodation resource, but it became an amazing place of community and connection and belonging and creativity,” said Soni in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Good Karma Cafe served vegan meals for $11 out of the UUC building before the University  bought the building from the church, which is now being renovated for the School of Dramatic Arts. Briefly, the Good Karma Cafe continued at the St. Mark’s Lutheran Church but closed down due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Soni said the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life came up with the idea for the Jubilee Vegan Café after the Good Karma Cafe shut down and they “began to imagine how [they] could continue in the same spirit.”
Burklo said that, at the time, the Good Karma Cafe was initially created, “there were not enough vegan options on campus,” and said that having those options is crucial for students whether they purchased a meal plan or not. Burklo said that the Progressive Christians at USC are committed to both social and environmental justice, and by continuing the work of supporting students with both a personal or religious commitment to plant-based eating, they adhere to the group’s mission.
Though the UUC relocated to Union Avenue after selling its building to the University, it continues to sponsor the Progressive Christians at USC and work with the University Religious Center, with which they collaboratively fund Jubilee Vegan Café.
The UUC is one of more than 60 congregations within USC’s “Defined Neighborhood Outreach Boundary,” which consists of a square mile radius around campus. The Office of Religious and Spiritual Life works directly with many of the larger congregations, Soni said, as a way to connect the USC community with the diverse community of L.A.
“Los Angeles is the most religiously diverse city in human history, and our neighborhood is really a microcosm of that diversity,” Soni said. “The whole world is in our neighborhood, worshiping and gathering in some way or another.”
The Jubilee Vegan Café welcomes all students, according to Burklo — which he described as “an oasis of friendship and community.” More than 50 different religious and spiritual clubs are hosted by the center alongside events and programs for students without a religious affiliation, such as biweekly vegan dinners hosted by the Secular Student Fellowship.
“All students on our campus are going through a spiritual growth process, whether it’s religious or not, and we’re there to serve them all,” Burklo said.

The United States is currently the most expensive country to go to college. With the growing desire of students to pursue higher education, the U.S. has taken advantage of this prospect and turned it into the ultimate business transaction.
The Education Data Initiative released a study showing that the cost of attending college has drastically increased in the U.S., with an annual growth rate of 6.8%. They also reported that the average cost per year for an in-state student attending a public university is $25,487, $43,161 for out-of-state universities and $53,217 for private universities. Let’s juxtapose these high numbers with the median annual household income: $67,521 in 2020. 
It is important to highlight the terribly high cost of attending a public university. These high costs are partly influenced by the lack of state funding, combined with the targeting and influx of full-paying students. Many of these institutions, both public and private, are marketed towards people who will pay the full price. This not only limits the acceptance rate for those asking for financial aid but consequently justifies higher tuition costs. Since universities know that there are a set of individuals who will pay for it, they will raise their prices. 
Simply look at the recent financial aid scandal between 16 of the nation’s top universities, who allegedly conspired together to reduce financial aid awards through methods of price-fixing. There are efforts being made within some of the world’s most “prestigious” institutions to ensure that there are as many full-paying students as possible. 
While USC prides itself on its merit and financial aid awards, the margin that many families are still expected to pay is universally considered high and forces a vast majority of students to take out student loans. 
Within the 2020 graduating class throughout the U.S., 55% of bachelor’s degree recipients took out student loans and graduated in debt. The average college loan borrower owed $38,792 in 2020 and reached a cumulative high of $1.58 trillion in debt. At the ripe age of 22, college grads are buried in debt. College is supposed to open doors and opportunities, not tie an individual down in 30 years of loan repayments. 
It is justified for students to want “the college experience” and everything that it entails. What is not justified is for college institutions, especially top-tier universities, to take advantage of that and make education incredibly financially inaccessible. 
In comparison, many European countries such as Norway, Finland, Sweden, Germany and Denmark offer free college tuition to public universities. Even China has significantly lower tuition rates relative to the U.S. The vast difference in prices when doing these side-by-side comparisons is not surprising considering the high costs of healthcare in the U.S., compared to the significantly lower or free costs in many of these other countries. The U.S. is notorious for attaching a hefty price tag to basic needs and wants. 
As college begins to get more expensive in America, it makes people wonder, is college really worth the price? For some jobs, such as a physician, a college education is fundamental. Similarly, many jobs outside of the STEM and medical fields, like corporate, law and education also require a college education. The value of college can also be seen through whether or not jobs are recruited from particular schools. The sheer number of people still going to college demonstrates that many people see the value in retaining a college degree. 
Much of a college education’s value can be derived from networking, research, academic and social opportunities, and there are not many other places where one can gain access to all of these things in the same place. However, there is also a sense of privilege that comes with acquiring a college degree in the sense that college graduates are more likely to get high-paying jobs relative to non-college graduates and with the high cost of attending university, these benefits are only accessible to those of higher socioeconomic status.
With the numerous factors that come into play when considering higher education, money should not be one of them. While the idea of success is subjective, having the discussion of whether or not it is worth going to college continues to remain unclear. However, what is clear is that the cost of attending college has become unnecessarily overwhelming.

Two weeks ago, I got my own skateboard. Running between two classes on the opposite sides of campus in 10 minutes can be challenging, so I decided that a skateboard would be my ideal way to commute. However, my decision was not made without any concerns. There are no designated lanes for pedestrians, and the bike lane paint on Trousdale has almost completely faded away, showing its current state of complete abandonment. With my novice skateboarding skills and the lack of clear skateboarding and cycling guidelines on campus, there’s a lot that can go wrong. 
Skateboards, scooters and bikes are popular and convenient means of transportation for college students nationwide. Although some colleges, such as the California State University system, ban them for safety reasons, many other colleges hold neutral attitudes toward these transportation tools and take measures to protect both riders and pedestrians. For example, UC Irvine has designated bike lanes for cyclists and requires skateboarders to walk their skateboard in campus core areas. Stanford University also poses a 10 mph speed limit for bikes in pedestrian zones. 
At USC, the guidelines do not seem very clear, despite the University administration apparently recognizing the potential safety issues of skateboards and bikes. In early February, the University held USC Safety Days to educate student riders on safety issues and emergency responses. There are also some signs indicating that students need to walk their skateboards, scooters and bikes in areas such as the Trousdale intersection and USC Village. But the signs are not very noticeable and are often ignored by students, either accidentally or intentionally. Moreover, when it comes to more crowded areas, the University does not have clear instructions, causing confusion among both riders and pedestrians. 
For instance, walking on the crowded Trousdale Parkway or Childs Way walkways in the middle of the day can be dangerous: Pedestrians never know when a skateboarder or cyclist will brush past them without a warning. If the riders are pros, they would be more experienced and know how to ride safely and fast. However, newer riders may not be able to handle emergencies properly. Last semester, I saw a skateboarder who failed to control their speed, accelerated down a ramp and hit a person in a wheelchair.
It is necessary for the University to not only provide safety training but also present more guidelines for riders. USC Safety currently has some safety instructions for bikes and scooters, but they are more similar to safety tips and only serve as suggestions. There is no further instruction on what to do on crowded roads or while riding through crowds of pedestrians. 
In order to help student riders who want to learn more about how to navigate themselves safely around campus, the University should provide more detailed written instructions. Students should be able to find more information regarding the use of bikes, skateboards and scooters on campus on USC websites, including the places on campus that don’t allow riding, the recommended speed for riders and when they should use bike lanes and sidewalks. The bike lanes could also be reestablished or put in use during campus “rush hours.” Furthermore, the University could consider creating more designated pedestrian or bike lanes on crowded roads on campus, creating an area for people to walk safely without having to be constantly alert. Finally, USC Safety could also hold online webinars more frequently to help more students learn about transportation safety on campus.
Skateboards, bikes and scooters are dynamic features of USC. They have not only provided convenient ways for students to commute but also instill passion and high spirits in everyday campus life, for me at least. For USC, the better way to encourage riding is to provide clearer guidelines and instructions for riders as well as pedestrians. This can help to reduce possible confusion, better the campus experience for both riders and pedestrians and make campus life safer and more enjoyable.

After days of bracing this week’s icy cold weather and hammering away at those midterm cram sessions at Leavey, the temptation to crawl back into your snuggly twin XL beds is alluring. A perk of eating at one of the three dining halls on campus is the variety of different cuisines served daily over the “same” menu at USC’s eleven retail cafes on campus — but again, who wouldn’t pick a warm, comfy meal at home over trekking to the cafeteria?
Well, to emulate that same variety, here are some lesser-known “secret menu” items you can buy with one of the bajillions of your meal swipes!
Law (and Fertitta) Cafes’ Salmon Bowls & Boba
The infamous salmon filet draped in Sriracha mayo, sprinkled with nori and laid upon a bed of steamed white rice with a side of avocado — popularized on TikTok in late 2021 — has the Law Cafe’s line winding out the door. You don’t have to walk down the basement and brave the hungry crowd, as this fish dish is available at Fertitta Cafe. With a meal swipe, you too can receive this Emily Mariko meal (a la carte) at two locations on campus.
Although not lately, Thai milk tea and milk tea (both served with boba) were also available for a meal swipe at the Law Cafe. With campus opening up more and more each day, we are crossing our fingers for the return of this convenient fuel for our after-class treat.
Seeds Marketplace’s Chicken Tenders & Crinkle Fries
The ultimate comfort food. These crispy chicken tenders and crinkle fries sprinkled with cajun seasoning are only available for meal-swipe orders through the USC Campus Dining Mobile Order App during the “lunch” meal period (11 a.m. to 4 p.m.). After checking the boxes of “Chicken Tenders” and your preferred drink under “Student Lunch Meal Plan” on the app, simply head to the back right corner of Seeds Marketplace and pick up these fried delights.
Fertitta Cafe’s Asian Snacks, Mochi & Panna Cotta
After a long week of unused meal swipes, you can head to Fertitta Cafe to gather some favorite childhood Asian snacks lined along the right wall near the entrance. As a two-for-one-swipe deal, you can choose from Hi-Chew candy, dried mango, Yan-Yan Chocolate dipped biscuit sticks, Hello Kitty jelly-filled marshmallows, white and milk chocolate wafers, butter cookies, Pocky, Sriracha Peas, My Pote potato chips and Asare rice crackers. If you’re feeling thirsty, feel free to mix-and-match one of these sweet treats with a full-sized drink. Explore the array of perishable food and stock up your dorm supply with new goodies!
Popovich Cafe and Literatea’s Flavored Lattes & Pastries
Coffee: A college student’s fuel to function. Rather than spend “real money” at Starbucks, be sure to frequent either Popovich or Literatea for all your coffee and latte needs! A singular meal swipe will get you any latte with a “flavor” (including mocha, caramel, hazelnut, or the occasional seasonal syrup like pumpkin spice in the fall), additional shots of espresso if you need that extra kick-starter to your day, an option for a milk substitute (ie. oat and almond milk) and a pastry or bagel of your choice. Although not listed as a meal swipe, this morning combo is readily available upon request of the friendly cashiers at these early-opening cafes.
Tutor Hall Cafe’s Banh Mi & Miso Salmon Bowls
Tucked away in the southwest corner of campus, Tutor Hall’s truly underrated Chipotle-esque Indian food meals have a new competitor, the Vietnamese beef and lemongrass chicken Banh Mi sandwiches. Layed between halves of warm and toasty French bread, the meat filling is complemented by cucumber, cilantro, Sriracha mayo and Daikon slaw that provides an all-encompassing bite of muted and zesty flavors. This sandwich, chip and drink combo is the perfect on-the-go meal if you’re around the Viterbi School of Engineering.
Another salmon dish without the Law Cafe line. This alternative for those not near the east of campus can enjoy this bowl (misleadingly listed under the “salad” option of the USC dining app), which consists of a salmon filet doused in Sriracha mayo served with jasmine rice, julienned carrots, cilantro and crunchy wonton strips.

The internet’s favorite sad boys have come back swinging with their third record “Sweet Tooth.” Moving away from their midwest emo band origins, Mom Jeans. have embraced the music of their youth and created a pop-punk record that artfully combines their usual lovelorn, whiny lyrics with hooky songs perfect for screaming at a concert. 
Their first two albums, “Best Buds” and “Puppy Love,” were filled with low energy, slightly more obscure songs that were perfect for listening alone in the dark, sobbing into your pillows. On this record, the sobbing still comes into play; however, it’s more likely to start while you jump around your room and pretend you’re at a blink-182 concert. 
This is a welcome change for the band. The opening track “Something Sweet” launches into their harder sound, and it’s immediately clear that the energy has changed. What remains however, is the pining, depressing lyrics that are still searching for someone or something to take the pain away. The second track, “What’s Up?,” released in 2021 as a single, racked up over 2 million plays on Spotify ahead of the album’s release, and by listening to the lyrics, it’s obvious why. Vocalist Eric Butler yells away, “But still I’m just pretending that I’m fine / When I’m feeling lousy all the time / I’m such a fuck / I’m such a fucking piece of shit / And you hate me for it.” This new pop-punk sound matches the regretful, angry and self-deprecating themes present in Mom Jeans.’ sound since their beginning. 
“This record was definitely an attempt to write songs and put together an album that had more broad listening appeal,” said Butler in an interview with the Alternative Press.
Regrettably, in their effort to have a more radio-friendly sound, we have lost some of the more iconic song titles that most people know them for (“Scott Pilgrim vs. My GPA” and “jon bong jovi,” anyone?). 
In looking back to their pop-punk predecessors, Mom Jeans. have taken some of the most fun elements of that time in music, such as the count-off refrain in “Anime Theme Song” and concert-ready chanting at the end of “Hippo In the Water.” They have definitely succeeded in making an album that’s ready for radio play, as these nods to their favorite bands will resonate with larger audiences.
However, it is a relief that Mom Jeans. have stayed in familiar territory with their lyrics and themes as they take risks with their sound, for it makes a great bridge between the old and the new. The greatness of Mom Jeans. comes from their relatability. Each of their records has featured relatable, everyday topics. We can’t relate to a famous band wrecking a hotel room or going crazy in Vegas, but we can relate to one that, after a bad breakup in “Crybaby (On the Phone),” sings “And I’ll never undеrstand why you’d do this to me / You really messеd me up / I’ll load all my stuff in the back / Of Brandon’s 2011 Toyota RAV-4.” We all have a friend with a 2011 Toyota RAV-4 to support us, don’t we?
Similarly, on tracks like “White Trash Millionaire” and “Anime Theme Song,” Mom Jeans. return to their well-loved, relatable themes of trying to stay sober — “So as the months get colder, I’m less sober / I’ll see your face over and over” — and hating yourself in relation to other people’s opinions — “​​Baby, I’m sorry, don’t wanna be lonely / I’ll change if I have to, just wanna be with you tonight.” 
Mom Jeans. have never strayed away from some truly depressing topics, but in “Graduating Life,” we see a new mastery of mature and artistic descriptions of pain. It’s a truly emotional and softer track compared to the rest of the album that gives us a glimpse of their future progression after this record. It’s obvious they came into this album with a more nuanced vision for their work, and it shows in lyrics such as “The future seemed so bright / But you just can’t wait to graduate life / This moment feels so nice, but you just can’t wait to graduate life.” The simple acoustic backing gives the song a gravitas it would not have had otherwise, with a wonderful little horn section in there, too. 
Mom Jeans. have truly moved in a new, inspiring direction with “Sweet Tooth,” and it makes looking to the future exciting. Taking influences from new places and having a different perspective for their band, they have pushed themselves to create songs that are more complex and interesting but still have their lovable relatability and Butler’s whiny yet endearing voice. After a stunner like this, it seems the only place to go is up.

I can still remember the first Bon Appétit video I watched. Sitting in my freshman dorm, Claire Saffitz attempted to create gourmet Doritos, experiencing constant setbacks and asking fellow chefs for advice.
For years, Bon Appétit has been one of the most popular food magazines, but the launch of their YouTube channel made them a cultural phenomenon. As a lifelong foodie and Food Network lover, it seemed only natural I would get sucked into the Bon Appétit multiverse. Throughout the pandemic, the Test Kitchen staff kept many of us entertained, offering moments of laughter during a trying time.
George Floyd’s murder in May 2020 forced a racial reckoning within our country,  and Bon Appétit was not immune to the criticism. Staffers began posting on social media about the ways in which the magazine’s Eurocentric view of food fed into racist narratives about non-white communities.
Tammie Teclemariam, a Bon Appétit staffer, tweeted a picture of the magazine’s then-editor-in-chief, Adam Rapoport, dressed in brownface for a Halloween costume.
As the photo gained media attention, many staffers pointed out that Rapoport’s leadership had given way to rampant racism, sexism and homophobia within the Bon Appétit workplace.
Sohla El-Waylly, a Bengali American chef and Test Kitchen personality, took to her Instagram stories to condemn Rapoport’s actions and point out she made significantly less than her white counterparts.
At the same time, Christina Chaey, a Korean American chef, announced that she had not gotten paid for her video contributions. Alex Delany, another Test Kitchen star, was called out for a Confederate flag cake posted to his Tumblr and a Vine in which he says a homophobic slur.
Andy Baraghani, a senior food editor, explained the ways Delany’s Vine reminded him of the homophobic abuse he has experienced throughout his lifetime. However, Twitter users were quick to point out the paradox of this situation.
Though Baraghani is gay, he is also a beloved and power member of the editorial staff. Contributor Alyse Whitney pointed out that Baraghani frequently used his influence to make it hard for her to advance her career at Bon Appétit.
Like many of us, I assumed that unsubscribing from Bon Appétit’s YouTube channel and ignoring the stars of the Test Kitchen was enough to absolve myself. However, an organization as powerful as Bon Appétit will always regenerate.
Once the media blitz died down, Bon Appétit returned with several new editors of color, led by editor in chief Dawn Davis, a Black woman committed to creating change within the magazine.
Bon Appétit now has almost six million subscribers, even more than what they had in May 2020, just before they were “canceled.” An organization with this much power over the food industry is not going anywhere.
Though Bon Appétit promised to create a more diverse workplace, it is our job as content consumers to hold their feet to the fire.
We cannot ignore the political significance and monetary control the food industry has, and Bon Appétit accounts for much of that power. We need to ensure that they fulfill their promise to diverse and equitable food media coverage.
It is not enough to get rid of blatantly problematic staff members like Rapaport and Delany. We can’t create a world in which Baraghani is not held accountable for his racism and misogyny because he has experienced homophobia.
In an intersectional world, it is important to remember our marginalization and our privileges interact with one another. Despite his oppression, Baraghani wields power privilege within the Bon Appétit hierarchy, putting him in a position to hurt other marginalized folks.
As celebrities do their best to dodge the bullets of cancel culture, they are quick to point out that marginalization, assuming this makes them immune to oppressing others. Baraghani remains a senior food editor at Bon Appétit, retaining his position of power despite the allegations against him.
While this article centers the food industry, these conversations about accountability extend much further. Cancel culture hopes that the monetary and social consequences media personnel face will be enough to force abusers to learn about social issues.
In reality, canceling someone rarely extends past a few media cycles. For the most part, the Bon Appétit staff who came under fire in June 2020 eventually regained their social media following and high-powered positions, and as other stories begin to dominate media headlines, supposedly canceled celebrities are easily able to return to their former status after generic apologies and claims of growth, once again wielding the power to hurt those around them.
By canceling a single person, we never have to critically analyze the systems that put them in power in the first place. We never have to consider the ways sexism, racism and homophobia are entrenched in our power structures. We never have to push ourselves to hold both individuals and establishments accountable for their everyday abuses.

Men’s basketball will host No. 2 Arizona Tuesday in a sold-out game. 
The Trojans were defeated 72-63 in the teams’ last meeting Feb. 5. However, USC has not lost any of the six games they played since the loss in Tempe. The Wildcats, on the other hand, lost their most recent matchup to unranked Colorado.
“We took note from Colorado, obviously,” junior forward Isaiah Mobley in an interview with Daily Trojan said. “They beat them by a pretty good margin, so we took note of that and then just worked on ourselves as well.” 
Over the past six games since the loss to Arizona, USC has regained a lot of the buzz that was lost following two losses to Stanford. 
Beating UCLA without Mobley and avenging the loss to Oregon earlier this year in Eugene were both accomplishments that the Trojans were praised for when it came time to vote for AP Polls. Senior guard Drew Peterson’s play has been a large factor in the win streak, averaging 18 points over the six-game win streak. 
The Wildcats’ loss to Colorado marks just their third of the season, with the other two coming from ranked UCLA and Tennessee. The team boasts a balanced lineup with four of five starters averaging double figures. 
Sophomore guard Bennedict Mathurin leads Arizona in scoring with 17 points per game, but had just 8 in the first meeting. Sophomore forward Azuolas Tubelis is second in scoring with 15 points per game. Tubelis had 18 points and 11 rebounds against the Trojans last month.
Arizona has beaten its opponents with a scoring margin of 17.8 throughout this season, which sits behind No. 1 Gonzaga for second in the nation. 
With the Wildcats at the top of the Pac-12 standings and ranked No. 2 in the nation, this game marks an opportunity for USC to prove themselves to national media doubters. 
“This isn’t just a new game,” Head Coach Andy Enfield said. “It’s a big game, sold-out crowd against Arizona, who’s second in the nation. We’re both the top two teams in the league currently with the standings, and we’ve been playing good basketball and so have they, so this is a huge game for us. We’re going to try to hold a home court advantage here, and it should be a lot of fun.” 
Other than just looking at Arizona’s loss to Colorado, Enfield stresses the importance of making improvements from USC’s loss Feb. 5.
“We just played Arizona, so we look at our game,” Enfield said. “Of course, we look at some of the things from the Colorado game, but they’re a different team. They play a little different style than us, so we have to use our strengths and try to play as competitive defense as we can for 40 minutes.”
Despite the crowd being sold out and this being one of the most important games of the season for the Trojans, Enfield is not worried about his players’ preparedness as he believes most of them are up for the challenge. 
“A lot of these guys have big game experience and March Madness experience,” Enfield said. “I think we’ve been very competitive on the road. We’re 9-2 on the road, 3-0 on a neutral site, so we’ve won a lot of games away from home.”
Tip-off is 8 p.m. at Galen Center.

It’s beginning to look a lot like March Madness. 
The regular season will end this weekend with conference tournaments set to begin next week. As always, the few remaining games will define the season for many teams, as an extra win or loss could be the difference between a spot in the NCAA tournament and a spot on the couch. 
The good news for USC fans is that the Trojans, barring any extreme plot twists, have already secured a spot in March Madness. Behind Head Coach Andy Enfield, the Trojans have had a successful season, going 25-4 with remaining games against two of the Pac-12’s best: Arizona and UCLA. 
CBS Sports has USC projected to be a 6-seed, a regression of sorts as the Trojans were ranked fifth overall in the Associated Press poll just six weeks ago. However, USC can get a boost come Selection Sunday with an impressive finish in the regular season and conference tournament. 
With this week’s games against the Wildcats and the Bruins, the Trojans have an opportunity to gain momentum at the most important time of the season. 
If USC wins its remaining two games and UC Berkeley beats Arizona, the Trojans will be the top seed in the Pac-12 Tournament and will have added two impressive wins against top 25 ranked teams to their resume. 
This will require USC to play disciplined but aggressive basketball. While the Trojans have proven they have the talent to knock down elite teams, beating UCLA at home earlier in the season, they also have struggled against subpar competition.
Just recently, it took two overtime periods for them to squeak out a win against an Oregon State team with a measly 3-23 record. 
If a double overtime thriller wasn’t enough excitement on USC’s road trip to Oregon, don’t count out the 70-69 win over Oregon. 
 Senior guard Drew Peterson sank a 3-point shot with 11.5 seconds remaining to bring the Trojans ahead by a point. The Ducks, with every win vital as their chances at an NCAA Tournament bid are getting smaller and smaller, gave the Trojans their best shot. While many of USC’s victories have not been pretty, the team knows how to win. 
When Peterson plays his best, the Trojans typically win. 
Over their six-game winning streak, Peterson is averaging 18.3 points, 7 rebounds and 4.3 assists per game. In his last outing against UCLA, Peterson played almost flawlessly. The senior had 27 points and shot 69.2% from the field. He also showed up on the defensive end, adding 5 blocks. 
Another key player for the Trojans is junior guard Boogie Ellis. The Memphis transfer has proven his toughness this season and had a game winning shot in the Trojans’ 62-60 victory over Washington State. Ellis was out for the Oregon State game with an ankle injury but was able to play 24 minutes against Oregon. A healthy Ellis will be vital for USC in the coming weeks. 
Compared to the other Power Five conferences and the stacked Big East conference, the Pac-12 has had a disappointing year. 
Arizona, USC and UCLA are all likely bids but, barring Oregon making it over the dreaded bubble or a Cinderella story in the Pac-12 Tournament, that’s it. 
Every other conference has at least one more team in the mix, with the ACC also having a relatively down year. Apologies to Bill Walton, who revealed that he had eight Pac-12 teams making the Big Dance, but the Pac-12 will be lucky to get a quarter of its teams in the mix. 
However hectic the USC basketball season has felt at times, the Trojans are in a prime spot for another successful NCAA Tournament. Buckle in basketball fans, because March is here.

Let me make this clear right from the beginning: This column will be about “Elden Ring.”
I know that some of you are probably tired of hearing about this game already, but please try to understand. Not only is it the most-watched category on Twitch, surpassing even “Just Chatting” by more than 100,000 viewers at the time of writing this column, it is also downright phenomenal according to almost every single gaming website out there.  
And by yours truly.
Since the game came out last Friday, it has dominated my waking hours in a way I never expected it to. If I’m not playing “Elden Ring,” I am watching streamers who are — sometimes simultaneously and across platforms. Usually, I would care about spoilers but this game is so vast that, if I didn’t spoil myself just a little, I might end up missing an entire area by mistake.
I am getting too ahead of myself. After all, what even is “Elden Ring”? Well, let me try and put it in simple terms. 
It is an open-world, role-playing game set in a fantasy world designed by FromSoftware, most famously known for developing the “Dark Souls” series. Much like in their other games, normal enemies in “Elden Ring” are ruthless and bosses can take hours to beat. Not only that, but checkpoints are sparse; leveling is tough and the story is so thin you can beat their games without knowing what anything meant. 
Suffice to say, this game won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. Until this point, I too was one of the many people who simply couldn’t find myself getting into the game. As soon as I got to the first boss in all the other FromSoftware games and realized how unfair it felt, I simply gave up. Sure, I watched YouTubers play it, but I never thought to complete them myself.
That is until I saw people play “Elden Ring.” For some reason, the game felt extremely fun. Maybe it’s because an open-world suits hard video games more than a linear path does. After all, if an area is too hard, you can just move to another one. 
Or maybe it’s because, by not holding the player’s hands and letting them figure out the story by themselves, players are actively encouraged to explore this beautifully detailed world, picking up the scraps and forming conclusions on their own. 
Regardless, I found myself more enthralled and immersed in the “Elden Ring” universe than I have been for any other game. Yes, someone who previously hated playing games as hard as this is now a die-hard fan who will revisit FromSoftware’s older titles. Of course, I am not alone in this, as “Elden Ring” is the company’s best-selling game by a huge margin already. 
In other words, it has just drastically increased its player base without fundamentally changing the formula of its game.
Feels like the esports scene could learn a thing or two from this, right?
Yes, yes, I somewhat lied when I said this column would be about “Elden Ring.” But if you’re interested in the professional gaming sphere like I am, it’s almost impossible to not think about how it can emulate such earnest success. 
In previous columns, I have already discussed companies attempting to increase their audience, specifically Riot Games and its recent push in making “League of Legends” a household name. When compared to “Elden Ring’s” boom, however, all that bending-over-backward that Riot is doing feels extremely artificial. 
That’s not to say that their strategy is wrong. After all, they couldn’t just stop supporting “League of Legends” and release a “better” game the next year. Indeed, on the surface, it seems like making a “better” game the next time around is all that we can learn from this recent success. 
However, this is only partly right. 
“Elden Ring’s” success points toward a possible way to produce a better product: Instead of simply churning out the same game over and over with slight quality of life differences or steering the franchise in a completely different direction, think about the ideal experience players yearn for and find a way to make that work. 
While that sounds complicated, it’s a concept that can be boiled down to “What do players wish our game was like?”
Nintendo recently asked themselves the same question, releasing “Pokémon Legends: Arceus” and finally setting the Pokémon franchise into full 3D as people have desperately hoped for. Lo and behold, the lesson holds — “Pokémon Legend: Arceus” is the best-selling Pokémon game on the Nintendo Switch. 
Esports companies can learn from this dogma and improve their games using audience expectations. Sure it’s not a foolproof format, but depending on the game, it might be easier than expected. 
For example, if Riot intends on expanding “League of Legends” from a game to a cultural phenomenon, adding more tangible lore elements into the game and providing an easier learning experience for the people who join might help. 
And for those who don’t expect their games to reach over into audiences that aren’t gamers, such being the case of tactical shooters overall, simply adding a series of maps that revise angles or adding new weapons that provide balance might be enough to get your player base re-engaged and bring others who are already used to playing similar games.
“Innovation” is always a word that is thrown around, but FromSoftware proves it is a goal genuinely worth pursuing. Regardless of how comfortable you feel your game may be in the professional world, looking at your fans’ expectations and doing your best to provide a game that fits with their vision will help you way more than dumping thousands of dollars into your competitive scene. 
After all, even with all the insane market research that happens in the field, it doesn’t take a genius to understand that what gamers want the most is simply a fun game.

USC swept a three-game series against the University of Nebraska at Omaha this past weekend at Dedeaux Field.
The sweep pushes the Trojans to three games above .500, now sitting at 5-2 through the first seven games of the season. 
Friday night’s match was hotly contested, with USC redshirt senior lefty Isaac Esqueda pitted against Omaha’s senior right-handed pitcher Mike Timmins. Both pitchers lasted over six innings and departed in the seventh inning with their teams down a run. 
In the bottom of the seventh, redshirt sophomore outfielder Rhylan Thomas hit a double to bring home redshirt sophomore Adrian Colon-Rosado for the tying run. Redshirt sophomore Miko Rodriguez came home on a sacrifice fly from redshirt sophomore infielder Tyresse Turner to take a 3-2 lead.
The Mavericks would tie the game on a sacrifice fly from second baseman Cam Frederick in the top of the eighth. The offenses for both squads stalled into extras, until a walk-off double from redshirt senior outfielder Trevor Halsema secured a 4-3 victory in 12 innings.
Game 2 of the series saw sophomore right-hander Tyler Stromsborg make his second start of the season for the Trojans. Omaha started sophomore right-handed pitcher Charlie Bell.
USC took the lead in the first on a single by Halsema, scoring Thomas and never looked back. 
A sacrifice fly by redshirt junior infielder Emilio Rosas and a third-inning bomb by junior infielder Nick Lopez proved to be enough offense for the afternoon. Stromsburg departed after five innings with the Trojans protecting a 3-2 advantage, and the bullpen silenced the Maverick bats the rest of the way.
Halsema was the spark plug for the Trojan offense, tacking on three hits and two RBIs on the day. Redshirt junior pitcher Garrett Clarke nailed the 5-2 USC victory with a save in the ninth.
Looking to seal the series sweep Sunday, the Trojans matched sophomore pitcher Jaden Agassi against Omaha junior lefty Caleb Riedel.
“It’s really hard when you’re 2-0 going into that third game to not think about trying to sweep a team,” said Head Coach Jason Gill in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “But at the end of the day, it’s not about sweeping the team — it’s about winning the day.”
However, the Trojans were challenged by the scorching hot bats of the Mavericks, as Omaha managed to chase Agassi out of the game after 5 hits and 3 runs in 2.1 innings of work. 
Redshirt junior pitcher Carson Lambert closed out the frame and subsequently shut the Mavericks down through the fifth.
“Jaden didn’t have a great day, but it wasn’t for a lack of effort. He just didn’t have his stuff,” Gill said. “Turn on the TV and watch the big leaguers — there’s times where those guys don’t have their stuff either.”
The Trojans cut Omaha’s lead to 1 on a two-run shot off the bat of Lopez, his second homer of the homestand. Each squad eventually added one run off of RBI singles. Entering the bottom of the eighth, Omaha held onto a slim 4-3 lead.
Leading off the inning, Halsema pounded an opposite field homer to right field to knot the score at 4. Redshirt sophomore infield and third baseman Johnny Olmstead scored on a passed ball to take the lead for USC. A triple to right-center off sophomore infield D’Andre Smith’s bat provided a two-run cushion and ultimately sealed a four-run spot in the eighth.
“We’ve been down in some games and our offense isn’t firing, but the guys are finding ways to scratch and claw and put more runs up than the other team,” Gill said. “We’re throwing strikes and playing catch, which is keeping us close enough for our offense to come back late.”
The series sweep pushes the Trojans to fifth in the Pac-12, half a game behind sixth-ranked Stanford. 
The Trojans have a busy schedule, but Gill says that the team will look to capitalize on practice time.
“Wednesday and Thursday are big practice days this week,” Gill said. “We have some stuff offensively that we need to get to, and maybe some situational game drills that we can work on for our offense.” 
Now well above .500, USC will look to continue its winning streak against Loyola Marymount Tuesday.

When she was seven years old, Logan Christianson made her first best friend. She grew up alongside Adia, whose Punjabi family became Christianson’s “second home.” Through this, she was introduced to Bollywood, joined in on celebrations of Indian holidays and made a lifelong friendship that sparked her interest in cultural and language study.
“Getting that intimate peek into someone else’s culture or someone else’s livelihood from such a young age, I feel, was really monumental in making me value different languages, different cultures,” Christianson said.
These early interactions cultivated an interest in global connections and community for Christianson, a freshman majoring in international relations. When the opportunity came to join a new foreign literary journal last fall, Christianson quickly put her name forward and now serves as the journal’s productions and social media manager.. 
Set to publish in April, Trojan Bloom is USC’s first student-run multilingual literary journal and is a space for students to publicly express creative works in their studied or native languages. According to Tania Apshankar, a junior majoring in creative writing who serves as the journal’s first editor in chief, the publication aims to foster interest in foreign language programs, encourage intercultural communication and present students the opportunity to further explore language in creative ways.
Trojan Bloom plans to offer biannual editions both in print and digitally, featuring exclusively undergraduate creative works in fiction, nonfiction, poetry, cartoons and other forms of literature. Works can be submitted in one of the 15 languages taught at the University and are limited to a maximum of 500 words. Students interested in submitting this semester must do so by March 8. 
For Apshankar, the journal’s emphasis on the multilingual aspect immediately attracted her. 
“There are a lot of literary journals on campus that are student-run which are in the English language,” Apshankar said. “We definitely felt this need. There’s a gap for foreign languages.” 
Hannah Schoettmer, a sophomore majoring in sociology, is both an editor and web designer at Trojan Bloom. Schoettmer said the journal’s multilingual approach is significant in its practical applications in both the “global workplace” and “global community.” 
“We live in a society that’s becoming increasingly multilingual especially with the advent of the internet and international travel,” Schoettmer said.
Associate Professor of Classics Lucas Herchenroeder, a member of the journal’s faculty advisory board, emphasized the practical applications of being multilingual and also said language learning is a way of “encountering forms of human experience that are beyond our own.” 
Lydia Whitman, a junior majoring in creative writing and editor at Trojan Bloom, said she believes the journal’s stories are unique in that they can be both reflective yet also introduce new ideas.
“I hope that when people read these, they will be able to relate to the content but also to learn something new about someone else,” Whitman said. 
While the journal has yet to fully explore plans to expand in other forms of media, intentions for biweekly podcasting are in the works. Herchenroeder said he hopes to expand podcasting into Latin and Greek in the near future. 
“I think podcasts would be great, not just for the students producing them [but listeners too],” said Herchenroeder, who used podcasts to study Arabic as a doctoral student.
The journal’s editorial team said they aim for readers to reorganize their perceptions of language not only as a route of functional activity, but increasingly toward a method of personal fulfillment and growth. Additionally, the journal aspires “to give more tools to language learners and also a platform for people to portray whatever they’ve been learning or writing in different languages,” Apshankar said. 
Herchenroeder said he anticipates a strong turnout for the first issue and believes students will recognize the opportunities the journal presents. 
“I hope that the journal will encourage serious thinking about the special opportunities that students have for language study and exploration during these very short few years that they’re in the University,” Herchenroeder said.
Editor’s note: This article was updated at 12:04 p.m. on March 2 to reflect that the deadline for submissions to the Trojan Bloom multilingual literary journal has been extended to March 8.

No. 16 USC holds an all-time record of 17-36 against Arizona since 1996. With Head Coach Andy Enfield’s squad facing the No. 2 ranked Wildcats on Tuesday, let’s look at five memorable matchups between the two Pac-12 powerhouses. 
2000: USC upsets Arizona 80-72 
The last time the Trojans defeated a squad ranked as high as No. 2 in the AP Poll, forward Brian Scalabrine led the upset over Arizona in the Sports Arena. Despite being without their leading scorer, forward Sam Clancy — who was out for the season due to his fractured right foot — Scalabrine’s career-high 27 points and forward David Bluthenhal’s career-high 26 points covered up the holes in USC’s offense. 
The win was especially crucial as the Trojans snapped the Wildcats’ seven-game winning streak and leapfrogged Arizona to take hold of the top spot in the Pac-10 conference. 
2018: Arizona defeats USC 75-61
In the 2018 Pac-12 championship game, the Trojans ran into a future No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft, Deandre Ayton, who showed why he was the top player in the draft. 
Ayton put up 32 points and 18 rebounds, finishing with an array of jump hooks, and-ones and alley-oops, to secure Arizona’s second-straight Pac-12 championship. Throughout this heavily anticipated meeting, Ayton repeatedly took advantage his matchup against former Trojan Chimezie Metu. 
2021: USC blows out Arizona 87-73
Heading into 2021, the Trojans were defeated 10 consecutive times when visiting Tucson at the McKale Memorial Center. However, a second-half explosion led by then-redshirt junior guard Isaiah White and freshman forward Evan Mobley snapped the losing streak and gave USC momentum heading into their next game against Arizona State. 
Wildcat freshman Azuolas Tubelis put up 31 points, but it wasn’t enough to combat the combined 25 second-half points from White and Mobley. Mobley also finished with a double-double, while making his presence felt on the defensive end.
2011: USC defends home court, upsetting Arizona 65-57
Led by now-Chicago Bull forward Nikola Vucevic, the Trojans upset the No. 10 Wildcats in the midst of an up and down season. Sitting at 15-12, USC marched into Galen Center determined to defend its home court against a better opponent. 
Vucevic led the way with 25 points and 12 rebounds, drilling four clutch free throws late in the game to put the Wildcats away for good. Guard Jio Fontan also added 21 points as the Trojans knocked off a top-10 ranked team for the first time in two years. 
However, the most impressive stat of the night for the Trojans was a season-low eight points for future No. 2 pick in the 2011 NBA Draft forward Derrick Williams. While Williams’ professional career did not result in stardom, he was not a player anyone wanted to face during his time with the Wildcats, averaging 19.5 points and 8.3 rebounds a game in his final collegiate season. 
USC’s staunch defense threw Williams off his rhythm and pulled off a huge upset to turn the tide in the Pac-10 conference. 
2016: USC defeats Arizona 103-101 in a 4-overtime thriller
By far the most memorable matchup between USC and Arizona, the two squads could only be separated after four overtimes. The Trojans eventually came out on top after two game-winning free throws by guard Elijah Stewart with 22 seconds left on the game clock.  
USC was up 12 points with just over five minutes to go in the fourth quarter, but the Wildcats clawed their way back into the game to force overtime, led by guard Allonzo Trier’s 25 points. 
On the other side, Stewart put up a career-high 27 points across the 60-minute game, mentally willing it out until guard Kadeem Allen’s contested three-pointer bounced off the rim and the buzzer sounded off. The Trojans came out on top after their first quadruple-overtime game in over 20 years. 
USC used this historic game as momentum, heading into UCLA four days later and defeating their crosstown rivals.

Books were never a real source of controversy for me. I saw them as a vehicle for entertainment and education. That was, until my senior year of high school.
One of the required readings for my English class was “Native Son,” a story about a Black man living in poverty in Chicago’s South Side in the ’30s. Naturally, we read excerpts of the book in class where my white teacher did not hesitate to read a racial slur aloud. With every graduating class, this became a point of conversation once students got to their senior year. Questions of “Did y’all get to the part where he says it?” and arguments of whether he should’ve skipped over the word were constant. 
Do I personally believe he had any right to say a racial slur, even in the context of education? No. But, to his point, that was the way the book was written and was meant to be read. This was the first instance where I saw how a book can cause some serious debate, but outside of the controversy, I found that I actually learned a lot about societal issues from reading “Native Son.”
Last year in my home state of Texas, legislators passed a law regulating how ideas of race and gender can be taught in school. Following this, Rep. Matt Krause sent a list of 850 books to superintendents to question whether or not they were on school bookshelves and claimed that they might “make students feel discomfort.” This list mostly targeted books about race, gender and sexuality.
Book bans are nothing new, but they have gained a serious amount of traction over the past year. The American Library Association reported it received a record of 330 book challenges last fall, a result of politicizing reading. 
The unprecedented drive of book challenges mainly comes from conservative groups, who are now taking the issue to politics. Advocacy group No Left Turn in Education argues that these books spread radical ideologies. Others say that kids just aren’t ready for books about sex. 
But when you’re challenging books about race and sexuality, you’re taking away these topics from those who really need it. You’re taking away the representation of marginalized groups in literature. Challenges to white, heterosexual stories are far and few between. These bans are inherently discriminatory in how they target marginalized points of view. Books are important to kids as they grow up and begin to learn about the world, and they need to feel that resources and representation are there for them.
Now, it’s important to note that not all challenges are coming from the conservative side. Books such as “To Kill A Mockingbird” have been under fire for years for how they address race. I implore everyone not to erase the racist history in literature. It’s important to keep these stories on the shelves as a point for reflection and understanding the problem. I learned from Professor Todd Boyd here at USC, though he was referring to film, that these older books represent an actual history in itself, a history that should not be forgotten.
The truth is that this movement of book challenges comes from parents asserting their own political ideologies into school and shielding their kids from what they deem inappropriate. To me, it feels like an act of parental control. With pandemic restrictions lifting, kids are getting back out into the world and away from their parents’ ever-so-watchful eyes. 
Here’s the thing: You can’t shield your kids from reality forever. If a student wants to learn about sexual orientation, then they will find a way to, so don’t make it harder for everyone. Taking books away from schools only limits the perspectives students are allowed to think about. At the age where people are just beginning to learn about the real world, they need to be able to have access to diverse and comprehensive information.
Let students make their own choices. Help them be inquisitive and learn about new things, especially in regards to race, gender and sexuality. If parents feel that strongly about their children not learning about certain subjects, then it’s up to them to make that clear. Have a personal no-read list if necessary — though I don’t think that’s appropriate either. But definitely don’t take resources away from a whole school.
Markus Dohle, CEO of the publishing company Penguin Random House, personally donated $500,000 to fight these bans and created the Dohle Book Defense Fund to provide support to communities where books are being challenged. While his actions may also be within self-interest (as multiple books being challenged are published by Penguin), it’s important to see why others should follow suit.
The bottom line is that books offer an incredible amount of information regarding all subjects, and schools need to provide more accessible resources, not less. Book challenges remove the opportunity to learn.
In a New York Times article, author Laurie Halse Anderson said it best: “By attacking these books, by attacking the authors, by attacking the subject matter, what they are doing is removing the possibility for conversation.”
