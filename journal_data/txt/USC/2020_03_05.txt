The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism announced a new master’s program in public relations and advertising last month. The new program will replace the strategic public relations master’s program beginning Fall 2020 and will adapt to changes in the industry.
“Today’s students are much more used to this new and emerging media environment and don’t even think in terms of the somewhat outdated silos that exist in corporations, such as public relations, advertising and marketing,” said Burghardt Tenderich, associate director of the USC public relations studies program. “Our students naturally take a much more holistic approach.” 
The new program will continue to evolve its curriculum to keep up with changes in the media industry, but it will focus more on research and analysis.
The program will also be offered as a progressive degree. Students can begin the coursework in their senior year and complete the master’s program over the course of two more semesters.
Tenderich, who leads the new program, said its core aim is to be completely media- or channel-agnostic; it will not focus on one specific media mechanism, which differs from traditional public relations programs that focus on the media.
“We want to make sure that our students are prepared for the jobs of today, tomorrow and in five years from now,” Tenderich said. “Taking this much broader, more holistic approach toward public relations and advertising is the way to go.” 
Tenderich said Annenberg faculty wanted to build a program that follows a researched, strategy-based methodology. One of their new courses doubles down on quantitative data analysis, while another focuses primarily on qualitative data.
“We think that the best public relations practitioners always begin at a point of research, and research then leads to critical thinking, to the development of strategy,” Tenderich said. “We think that is the best methodology and something we frequently [don’t] see in industry, where companies come up with publicity tactics that are clearly not based on research, critical thinking and strategy.” 
The program’s practice-oriented methodology sets it apart. Many part-time instructors are accomplished industry executives, and those in the program will work closely with the industry on job placements and internships, Tenderich said. Additionally, it will be working with the Annenberg Media Center, as the degree will have two core multi-platform content production courses that have Annenberg Media Center elements. According to Tenderich, students will also be encouraged to volunteer for Media Center work.   
The impetus for this new program originated from Annenberg Dean Willow Bay’s installation speech in August 2017, in which she said it was the opportune time to review the public relations program and address a changing public relations industry and its future. 
In a recent interview with the Daily Trojan, Bay said Annenberg plans to expedite the development of new graduate programs, which was a process that was already underway in August 2017 and has since continued. 
“I believe all of our graduate programs are responsive and adaptive, and that we add new classes frequently and refresh existing classes every single semester,” Bay said. “We integrate industry professionals as faculty to bring in current thinking and the best current practices, and to help us identify emerging trends and changes. That’s a standard part of everyday operations at Annenberg.”
A council of advisers composed of Annenberg faculty and senior executives in the public relations, advertising and influence relations fields was created to help implement the program. The council is looking for an entry-level candidate that is able to think critically, analyze and translate data into action, have a level of economic literacy and be able to create multi-platform content. 
It took nearly a year since the creation of the advisory council in Spring 2018 to complete all the research, which was split into primary and secondary research, according to Tenderich. The primary research included informal focus groups with public relations and advertising executives, a following review with members in the industry and of related programs and additional market research. Secondary research included reviewing industry studies, academic literature and press articles in various industry publications. 
Those who gave input  included the public relations curriculum council, the Center for Public Relations Board of Advisors and Bay. Other contributors included Gordon Stables, clinical professor of communication and director of the Annenberg School of Journalism, and Josh Kun, professor of communication, chair in cross-cultural communication and director of the Annenberg School of Communication. The team spent several months more to build the curriculum and submit it to USC for approval. 
Anthony Baca, a graduate student studying strategic public relations, said many students are still unsure about what the new program will bring.
“[We’re] not really quite sure what’s gonna come about with it but I think it’ll bring a lot more knowledge and perspective into the degree program,” Baca said. 
Fred Cook, director of the USC Center for Public Relations, said the program exists to prepare students to work in different areas in communication and public relations by broadening the traditional curriculum. Cook, who was on the committee to create the program, said it will teach students the skills that will allow them to succeed as leaders in their future careers.
“Reflective of a trend in the industry, where all these marketing disciplines are merging, we think that the students in the future have to be able to understand every aspect of marketing and advertising and public relations branding in order to be successful,” Cook said. “We’re broadening the scope of what we teach to make sure that they can take advantage of all these different industries when they graduate and have a lot of different opportunities across different sectors.”
Tenderich said current and prospective students, practitioners and executives have given the program and its creators overwhelmingly positive and encouraging feedback. 
“We hear from our constituencies that this is the right move at the right time,” Tenderich said. “We’re excited about that and we think that this new program will build on the success of the previous one.”

Secretary General of the Kofi Annan Commission on Elections and Democracy in the Digital Age Stephen Stedman discussed the hindrances of the internet age on the democratic election process and provided recommendations for steps the government can take to lessen the disruption of fair democratic election through media to more than 50 people at Ronald Tutor Campus Center Wednesday. 
The conversation, which was moderated by Center for the Political Future director Bob Shrum and Global Policy Institute director Steve Lamy, elaborated on the findings from the Report of the Kofi Annan Commission on Elections and Democracy in the Digital Age released in January, which detailed the impacts of social media in elections.
The Annan Commission aims to protect the legitimacy of democracy. Its recent report shared data about new democracies globally and provided recommendations for governments hoping to protect democracy from the threats of technology, including misinformation and propaganda. 
Stedman, a professor at Stanford University, said countries with high polarization like the United States were likely to face disinformation. 
“If you are a country, like the United States, that has pre-existing high levels of polarization, has pre-existing high levels of distrust in institutions and has highly partisan traditional media, you are going to be particularly vulnerable to network propaganda, disinformation [and] hate speech,” Stedman said. 
Stedman said the U.S. climate of polarization and distrust was considered abnormal to those of other democracies. He said the upcoming election will be heavily impacted by dishonest advertisements, including hacking of candidates’ private social media accounts, campaigns and parties and paid advertisements that spread disinformation. Former 2020 presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg, who dropped out Wednesday, spent more money on advertisements than all the other candidates combined in hopes of gaining more votes, according to the Washington Post. 
“I think [2020]’s going to get really bad,” Stedman said. “I think political advertising in this country until November is going to be a sewer … There’s a whole bunch of unethical practices out there concerning the digital space and political advertising.” 
Facebook does not have strict guidelines for candidates and parties, Stedman said, which allows candidates and campaigns to promote anything on the website. Stedman also said the power of microtargeting is growing, meaning audiences with similar beliefs are only receiving information that affirms their own perspectives.
“We’re in a different age,” Stedman said. “What you can do with social media is much more potent than what you had in the past.”
Stedman used Mexico as an example, explaining that its last elections happened alongside the invention of “Verificado,” which allows voters to send in questions with a hashtag to clarify the truth behind messages.
Stedman said the Annan Commission did not investigate whether social media should be regulated or removed, but focused instead on evaluating electoral integrity on these platforms. 
Stedman said the government should define political advertising rather than allow media platforms to create their own definitions. He added that the government should require the digital world to be transparent by making it easier for users to identify bots. 
Daniel Mills, a sophomore majoring in political science and economics, asked Stedman whether the population can be educated and persuaded to reject biased, misleading political ads or misinformation on platforms. Stedman said that because the United States is polarized and the tactics have already been used by the Republican Party, there is no way to force the population to disregard certain ads online.
“Even with fact-checking, it’s not clear how effective [this strategy] is,” Stedman said. “Fact-checking doesn’t change the belief of somebody who is an ardent supporter … and if you are an ardent opponent of whoever is putting out the disinformation, you are already predisposed not to believe it.” 
Muyang Zhang, a graduate student studying aging services management, attended the event in hopes of learning more about U.S. politics as the 2020 election is approaching. The discussion helped Zhang identify the positive and negative effects of the digital world. 
“Media gives all people a right to say what they want, but because of this, more people may not know the truth but they still say a lot, so these words may confuse other people,” Zhang said. “There would be false news and true news. People need to figure out which one is true.”

USC reassured students that no cases of coronavirus have occurred within the USC community and encouraged students to go about their usual routine following word that Los Angeles County had declared a local health emergency Wednesday after an increased spread of the virus in L.A. and across the country. 
Six additional cases have been diagnosed in L.A. County over the last two days, bringing the current count to seven. Gov. Gavin Newsom also declared a state of emergency in California Wednesday in light of the state’s first coronavirus-related death that afternoon. 
In an email sent to students, staff and faculty Wednesday, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman reiterated the University’s recommendation against international travel and detailed best practices for preventing the spread of disease, including frequent hand-washing and refraining from touching one’s face.
“Although this announcement comes on the heels of other news related to COVID-19 in California, there is no Los Angeles community transmission at this time, and no cases at USC,” the email read. “L.A. County Department of Public Health has stated there is no immediate threat to the general public. Los Angeles County residents, students, workers, and visitors are encouraged to engage in their regular activities and practice good public health hygiene, as this is the height of flu season across the County.”
In an email to faculty and staff Tuesday, administrators advised instructors to familiarize themselves with online teaching tools, such as Blackboard and video call service Zoom, so studies can continue in the event that the coronavirus spread worsens and students are unable to attend classes on campus.
“Please become familiar with these online learning tools this week and practice engaging with your classes using one or both methods so that if the need arises, you can adapt quickly with minimum impact to our students,” the letter read. “To help with this process, we have taken measures to ensure you have the resources needed to make these preparations as easily as possible.”
Brian Bernards, associate professor of East Asian languages and cultures and comparative literature, sent an email to students informing them of the backup plans requested by the University. Bernards plans to use Zoom, Blackboard and Top Hat if necessary.
“While there are as yet no reported cases of coronavirus among the USC community, USC faculty have been advised to begin making contingency plans for moving course materials to online and distant learning platforms,” Bernards said in the email. “If this ends up being the case, it will be — although challenging and definitely not ideal — a doable transition for the EASC 160 curriculum to be delivered through a combination of the Blackboard, Top Hat, and Zoom platforms.”
USC also posted a University-wide notification to Blackboard this week warning students and staff about the risks of traveling abroad and urging students to reconsider international spring break plans. The message cautioned students about the complications that have arisen because of the spread of the virus, including flight cancellations, quarantines and problems crossing borders. 
Van Orman asked that professors waive the requirement for a doctor’s note to excuse absences due to respiratory illness, making it easier for sick students to stay home from class and keep from spreading the contagion. 
In a statement updated Monday, the University said its Emergency Operations Center group, which meets daily to assess local and large-scale risks, was keeping abreast of developments in the coronavirus epidemic. The group has been evaluating University-related travel, accommodating housing for students returning from abroad and assessing whether to postpone or cancel certain campus activities.
“We anticipate adjustments to the way we conduct our teaching will be necessary in order to ensure our students continue to make academic progress,” the statement read.
USC has canceled several of its international programs — including spring break trips to Europe and Asia and semester-long study abroad programs in China, Italy, Iran and South Korea, all of which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has designated with a Level 3 travel health notice — amid the spread of the coronavirus. 
The CDC recommended universities cancel study abroad programs, which USC heeded with its cancellation of all remaining international spring break programs. 
The update came hours after L.A. County declared a public health emergency in response to an uptick in coronavirus diagnoses.

Former Undergraduate Student Government Executive Officer Montana Houston was removed from her position as senior director of programming Tuesday following violation of USG policy and complaints from USG-affiliated assemblies. The decision came after several assemblies under the programming branch sent a joint statement to the executive cabinet outlining frustrations with her proposed amendment regarding the incorporation of new assemblies. 
President Trenton Stone would not disclose the circumstances of the violation.
Houston’s proposed amendment would change how future assemblies are incorporated within the programming branch and how they are differentiated from committees. 
The original bylaw, which was approved in a USG meeting in early February, stipulated that for an assembly to be recognized under USG, the organization would have to provide either the signatures of five presidents of member organizations looking for incorporation or a petition signed by one registered student organization president and 50 or more current undergraduate students. Houston’s amendment, in reference to this section, would eliminate the second option.
Assemblies, such as the Latinx Student Assembly and the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, drafted and signed the letter sent to Stone and Vice President Mahin Tahsin after Tuesday’s Senate meeting. LSA and QuASA declined to comment further on the complaints outlined in the letter. 
Houston expressed concern that the new process of incorporating assemblies would place a financial burden on the programming branch and make it difficult to accommodate the needs of existing committees.
Stone said Houston’s removal was decided by a majority vote of executives after the joint statement requested their official intervention. This process is guided by the USG bylaws, which outline the removal of a presidentially appointed USG member by the executive cabinet. 
Stone declined to comment on the content of the complaints, citing professional courtesy, but mentioned that they had been brought to the attention of the cabinet on multiple occasions. 
“We’ve had conversations in the past over numerous weeks, the fall semester and spring semester,” Stone said. “And this is the first formal complaint from the group as a whole. But there have been conversations and attempts to make adjustments over a number of weeks.” 
Houston assumed the senior director of programming position in February 2019 after she was appointed by Stone and Tahsin following their election win. 
Houston said she received disparaging treatment from USG members for her opinions on changing the bylaws, referencing a hostile work environment. 
“I was a target because I kind of supported different views, and I was targeted personally about my intelligence by my fellow [executive] members,” Houston said. “The sentiment grew from a very intellectual discourse that was really respectful.”
Stone said there will be another executive cabinet meeting to discuss USG’s contingency plan for fulfilling the regular responsibilities of the senior director of programming for the remainder of the semester. In the meantime, he said it was important to maintain this professional courtesy for Houston while also being transparent about the presidential removal process.
“I think there’s a balance of respecting the privacy of [Houston] and the different things that have occurred, as well as the privacy of the programming directors and assistant directors that sent the dissent letter,” Stone said. “There’s no requirement for us to [notify] the entire organization or the student body by any means, but I think [it is] in the best interest of just keeping everyone in the loop and trying to be communicative.” 
Eleonora Viotto, director of the Political Student Assembly, said the assembly signed the letter along with other cultural groups in solidarity with organizations that benefit from the bylaw, including the Native American Student Union. 
“We signed on because we firmly believe that USG and its programming board should be as inclusive and as diverse as possible,” Viotto said. “We loved the amendment that [the] Senate had voted on to promote that inclusivity and diversity and wanted to make sure the language remains the same.”
NASU members presented their support of the resolution in the February meeting’s open forum, acknowledging their appreciation of the opportunity to take advantage of more resources guaranteed by USG recognition.

Whenever conversations on art arise, genre can be a necessary and helpful tool for artistic categorization. Genre allows us to sort works — music, literature and film alike — into groups based on shared motifs, stylings and concepts. We use genre as a reference point for new works, as well as a means of deciphering our own preferences.
For mediums such as music, film and literature, genre is king. In fact, it feels nearly impossible to have a conversation about a title without invoking genre. Think about trying to describe “Knives Out” without the term “whodunnit.” Or, try recommending Kanye West’s “Jesus Is King” album (a hard enough task as is) to a friend without using the term “gospel.” It’s really hard, right?
It’s for this reason that I don’t understand why the concept of genre isn’t used as much to talk about comedy. You wouldn’t ask your friends to catch a movie with you without knowing what types of movie you want to go see. It’s rarely asked: What kind of comedy is it? What kind of jokes will they be telling? Should I invite my mom or should I have never even considered sharing an experience like this together? With comedy, audiences are much more likely to be content with simply going to see “a comedy show.”
The thing is, comedy does have genres. Dark comedy, slapstick comedy, blue comedy, observational comedy, deadpan comedy and cringe comedy are all separate, legitimate genres. Still, we treat comedy as a different, more easily accessible art that doesn’t require the bookish categorization across the board that other art forms do. 
This casual sentiment toward comedy exists because it’s the one art form we create every day when we crack jokes with our friends. Because of this familiarity, most of us consider ourselves to be intuitively good judges of comedy. When it comes to jokes that we don’t particularly enjoy, we’re much more likely to declare them bad than to simply concede that the joke’s not for us — that it is not our genre of comedy.
We also tend to forget that all of us have had an embarrassing situation where we’ve tried telling a joke to someone and failed at getting a laugh. Someone may have thought your joke was stupid or simply did not understand it. Either way, it’s a microscopic but significant blow to the ego that not many people willingly experience. Most people just fake laugh as an easy patch when the joke doesn’t land. However, when the person conveys their disengagement with the joke, you know one thing: The joke didn’t work.
There is one rarely used and vastly underrated phrase that can be used to approach a clash of humor. It’s a completely respectful way to signal that the joke didn’t land for one reason or another. 
“I’m sorry, it’s just not my sense of humor.”
This one phrase conveys the message, but why don’t we use it often? For one, most people tend to think they’re funny and most people’s conception of funny is a near-universal sense of humor. Most people typically use humor to connect, not categorize people by their own circles of humor. But this, in essence, is what a sense of humor is. A sense of humor is not simply enjoying all kinds of humor relatively the same amount — it’s having a defined idea of the kinds of humor you click with the most and the least.
Think in terms of music. You may enjoy a great jazz composition from time to time, but what you really like is rock and hip-hop music, thus, you listen to and search out the latter more. You wouldn’t go to a Jason Aldean concert if you knew that you didn’t like country music. Why would you go to a shock comic’s show if you don’t typically enjoy edgy or provocative humor? You can still go — just know what you’re getting into and understand that it might not be exactly what works for you.
It’s funny — most people think of a good sense of humor as a tendency to enjoy any and all jokes that come their way, but is it a sense of humor if you don’t have a sense of the kinds of humor you truly connect with?
With this in mind, don’t panic if you don’t really “get” a joke or if someone doesn’t love yours. One can still connect with and show appreciation for a joke without disingenuously laughing, putting it down or feeling slighted. There are plenty of jokes in the world to tell and enjoy. This one just might not be your sense of humor.

Most students may have expected Dave Burd’s first appearance on campus to be as rapper Lil Dicky, possibly performing at USC Springfest. But in a departure from his rap career, the artist and activist visited the School of Cinematic Arts Tuesday night to screen the pilot episode of his new FXX show “DAVE.” 
“I just feel like it’s bizarre to address me as Lil Dicky,” Burd said to the audience in the Ray Stark Family Theatre. “I love my rap name. I hate it as well. But I think I’m supposed to hate it, but I love it, too.” 
Although Lil Dicky has a reputation as a comedic rapper, as hinted by his title, the show reveals a side of him that most fans may not know. 
Inspired by Burd’s real-life journey, “DAVE” revolves around a goofy Jewish man who goes viral on YouTube and plans on becoming rap music’s next big star. Juggling his kindergarten teacher girlfriend with his hectic lifestyle demanded by his career pursuits, he is extremely talented and confident, yet ill-prepared. 
Created by Burd and Jeff Schaffer, the “Seinfeld” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm” director who also attended the screening, the show captures audiences with its witty dialogue and Burd’s comic delivery. 
Before the screening, Oscar Ramos, a first-year student in the film and television production MFA program, expressed his interest in the rapper but was unfamiliar with Burd outside of his musical endeavors. 
“To be honest, I came for Lil Dicky, but I’m hoping that’s kind of an introduction to Dave Burd,” Ramos said. “I don’t know much of his outside work aside from his rapping.” 
Ramos got what he hoped for. Both the show and the Q&A that followed introduced the audience to Dave Burd, the person, and Dave, the subject of Burd’s comedy. 
Burd and Schaffer joined the audience for the screening, and Burd said he enjoyed watching the viewers’ enthusiastic reactions to the episode.
“DAVE” is similar to FX’s “Atlanta,” which follows two cousins’ experiences in the Atlanta rap scene. Burd acknowledged the show as an inspiration for his own, which has been in the works for about six years.
“You guys work for ‘Atlanta?’” Burd joked when the crowd applauded his praise of the show during the Q&A. 
Throughout the night, Burd proved that more than just his music is comedic. With each question and crowd reaction, Burd offered a clever response, much like his not-so-far-fetched character. 
One question after the screening regarded Burd’s use of a Jewish slur in his 2013 song “All K.” Burd stumbled through the beginning of his response but later argued that he took control of the typically offensive word and that, for the sake of a joke, its use was permissible. 
“I really believe in my moral compass,” Burd said. “I think it’s clear that in anything I make, I’m not remotely anti-Semitic.”
Following that, Burd was hit with a follow-up question about his 2018 collaboration with singer Chris Brown, who was charged with felony assault in 2009. 
“As a society, we have two choices: We can never hear from him again, or we can allow him to use his talent for good,” Burd said. “I want you to know that I really respect that question. That’s the first time I’ve ever even been asked that question, surprisingly, and I don’t know how I’m not asked it at every moment.” 
Ironically, earlier in the conversation, Burd admitted to being tone-deaf and said he hopes that comes through in “DAVE.” 
“You’ll just see kind of the most tone-deaf, narcissistic version of me … but I certainly am narcissistic, and I’m honestly tone-deaf a lot,” Burd said. “But I think it’s slightly hyperbolized for the show. I really want people to see that — see me for me.”
Olga Khaminwa-Joseph, a freshman majoring in narrative studies, was initially familiar with Burd’s music career alone but noted similar themes between his rapping and the show. 
“He’s very vulnerable but in a way that it doesn’t feel like vulnerability. It just feels very natural,” Khaminwa-Joseph said about the show. “And I think you kind of hear that in his music, too. It’s sort of self-deprecating, but I think in the show it’s not too self-deprecating — it’s just fun.”
The show’s relatability shines through as Dave, the character, also experiences the awkwardness of seeing a doctor about a possible case of herpes that is actually only razor bumps. With considerably raunchy moments like these, the show also presents itself as an opportunity for the real-life Burd to take some creative liberty in telling his own life story. 
“Why would I tie myself to reality when I can do anything?” Burd asked the audience. 
“DAVE” is currently  on Hulu and new episodes will premiere Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on FXX.
