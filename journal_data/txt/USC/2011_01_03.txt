Lindsey Munday has been hired as head coach of the new USC women’s lacrosse program, athletic director Pat Haden announced Monday.
Munday, 26, was a key contributor as both a player and an assistant coach during Northwestern University’s run of five consecutive NCAA championships, spanning from 2005-2009.
An All-World member of the U.S. women’s lacrosse, she had been serving as head coach at Mount St. Mary’s in Maryland after being named to the position on Aug. 30, 2010.
“It was imperative that we hire a coach with the energy, experience and plan to build a premier women’s lacrosse program,” said Haden in a statement. “Lindsey Munday embodies all that we are looking for as we take on this exciting endeavor. Her background both as an elite player and an elite coach who has been part of five national championships is a perfect match for a program that we hope will soon play at a championship level.”
At Northwestern, she served as the program’s recruiting coordinator and offensive coach, also helping to scout opponents. During her tenure, the Wildcats compiled an overall record of 85-4, including a 23-0 mark in 2009, and won the NCAA title in 2007, 2008 and 2009 while advancing to the NCAA championship game in 2010 as well.
“I am honored and humbled to be named the first head women’s lacrosse coach at USC,” said Munday. “USC is a truly unique university with premier academics and championship athletics. The University’s storied history, coupled with the support from its administration top to bottom, will provide the USC women’s lacrosse program with the resources to be nationally competitive.”
Set to begin play starting with the 2012-2013 season, the team will compete as part of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, becoming the conference’s seventh women’s lacrosse program. The other teams include Denver, Fresno State, Oregon, St. Mary’s and UC Davis.
“It is an incredibly special opportunity to begin a new program and I cannot wait to recruit student-athletes who are passionate about lacrosse and about joining this amazing time in USC women’s lacrosse history.”
As a former member of the USC Women’s Lacrosse team, I am so excited about this announcement! I had such a wonderful experience on the club team. It really made my time at USC so much fun! Good luck and fight on!!!

Jerry Brown was sworn in as California’s 39th governor by Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye in the Sacramento Memorial Auditorium on Monday morning.
The new governor’s speech, which lasted about 18 minutes, concentrated on how the state will handle the current fiscal crisis.  Brown plans to reveal a spending plan next week that he says will have “no more smoke and mirrors” and “no more empty promises.” He also stood by his campaign promise that any taxes proposed would have to be approved by voters.
Though Californians have a large deficit to overcome, Brown said our ancestors have overcome greater challenges in California.
“The people of California have not lost the pioneering spirit or capacity to meet life’s challenges,” Brown said.  “This is a time to honestly assess our financial condition and make the tough choices.”
Brown said he hopes Californians will put aside their political differences for the betterment of the state.
“The year ahead will demand courage and sacrifice,” Brown said.  “We need to learn to work together as Californians first, members of a political party second.”
Are politicians even worth mentioning on a trojan-daily. Does even one meet the trojan’s qualities?….????
