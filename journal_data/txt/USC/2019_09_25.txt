A walk down Trousdale Parkway is filled with new vibrant colors and art thanks to the banners featuring artwork by local artist Pola Lopez in celebration of Latinx Heritage Month. For the first time in USC history, banners that represent all 25 Latinx countries and feature symbolic images, ranging from ancient artifacts to a portrait of civil rights activist Cesar Chavez, hang above USC’s historic walkway. 
La CASA partnered with University Communications to produce seven original art pieces that embodied the diversity within the Latinx community and unveiled them Wednesday afternoon at Tommy Trojan, where 50 attendees listened and enjoyed the Latinx music. 
Billy Vela, director of La CASA, told the audience that the organization invited students in the Latinx community to present aspects of their culture before selecting and pitching concepts to the artist during a seven-to-eight month process. 
“This has been a long time coming, based on the shoulders and hard work of our ancestors … [and] all the other marginalized communities,” Vela said. “At this time politically in our country, it is imperative that we really know each other, and more importantly, that we actually respect one another because every culture and every [group of] people have amazing things to offer.” 
Lopez organized the students’ concepts to create seven pieces depicting Mesoamerica, indigenous people and the civil rights movement La Causa. Two paintings reflected the 25 flags of Latin America, unified with the statement somos todos un pueblo (“we are all one community”).
“[Lopez] really did encompass everything it means to be a person of Latinx descent,” said Yocelyn Pina, a freshman majoring in architecture. “In particular, I really love the one showing Latinos graduating and their parents because it really is, for many Latinx students, such a struggle and a monumental moment in their lives being able to get an education and being able to get support while getting that education.” 
During the unveiling, event planners like Winston Crisp, the vice president for student affairs, and David Galaviz, associate vice president of local government relations, and student staff members Diana Greer and Xavier Hernandez spoke about the significance of the banners. 
“It’s a very big moment to have this year at USC, to have our culture displayed in the middle of campus right next to Tommy Trojan,” Hernandez said. “I’ve never been part of something like this or seen something like this on campus. To have a voice where we can see a lot of the input that we put on campus, to see people we actually know [on the banner], to see unsung heroes not everybody knows but will know is going to be a very, very beautiful journey.” 
While pins with miniature versions of the artwork were distributed, Latin fusion dance team Break on 2 performed as part of the celebration. Andrea Porras Portillo, the team’s president and a senior majoring in communication, said events like the banner unveiling and her group’s performance help make the Latinx community more visible on campus. 
“It creates an interest in our culture, in our dances, in our music, in our art and in our people that I think is really essential to create a culture of diversity and inclusion,” she said. 
Avaion Ruth, a freshman majoring in health and human sciences, said the banners make Latinx culture more visible at USC. 
“When you go outside to L.A., there’s so much Latino culture, but when you get on campus, it’s a lot more whitewashed, so I think it’s definitely important that we’re not erasing the culture that’s around USC,” Ruth said. “I think it’s amazing to walk down [Trousdale] and look up and see people who have skin like mine.”

When A.J. Eckstein transferred to USC as a sophomore, he was looking forward to joining a club that would combine his passion for business with his Hispanic heritage. He quickly realized after attending the Marshall School of Business involvement fair that there was no such club specifically for Latinx students. 
It was up to him to launch his own club.
Eckstein, now a senior majoring in business administration, said that he spoke with leaders in Marshall and La CASA and learned that there had been a chapter of the Latino Business Student Association at USC founded in 1978, but that the organization had folded in 2016 because it lacked the leadership to continue. 
Eckstein spoke to friends on campus, who agreed that they needed to bring the organization back and began recruiting friends to help relaunch the club. 
Eckstein met Ricardo Reyes, a senior majoring in neuroscience, through a consulting club at Marshall, and they started working on the organization during the summer of 2018, focusing on recruiting members, getting USC recognition and finding sponsors. 
“He knew that I was Mexican through my background and he also has some Mexican background,” Reyes said. “We wanted to bring opportunities to the Latinx community because we noticed there weren’t any major clubs.”
They spent the summer calling LBSA chapters at other colleges and past USC LBSA alumni and messaging incoming students on Facebook to spread the word about the organization’s relaunch. 
They also reached out to Jody Tolan, who served as the faculty adviser for the former LBSA chapter, to join their team. 
Tolan, an assistant professor of clinical management and organization, watched the old LBSA group become inactive as its leadership, consisting predominantly of seniors, grew busy searching for jobs, she said. When Eckstein emailed her in April last year to express his interest in reviving the organization, she said she was impressed by his energy and enthusiasm to create a space for Latinx students at Marshall.
“What happened in the past was seniors would take it on and do it on their own and didn’t recognize they needed to build an effective team,” Tolan said. “I think [the current leadership has] been very good at recognizing how to build a team that is committed to the long-term vision of the organization.” 
Through the work they put in that summer, LBSA received four sponsors for its first semester, including Ernst and Young, Boston Consulting Group, Oracle and Union Bank. The organizations agreed to provide financial support along with one-on-one talks with recruiters for LBSA members. Within a semester, LBSA grew to more than 100 members.
Now with around 170 general members and 11 executive board members, the organization remains open to students from all majors and backgrounds. Reyes said there are no cutoffs and no selective application process to join the organization. 
“The whole point of LBSA was for it to be inclusive, especially for people that are struggling to get involved or to learn,” Reyes said. “A lot of organizations had a very difficult process to get in, so we didn’t want to do that. Essentially anyone that applies gets in.” 
LBSA hosts events throughout the semester that include professional and social networking, community service and mentorship programs. They hold a speaker series to bring entrepreneurs to talk with members, lead resume and cover-letter workshops, tour companies like Hulu and Deutsche and host recruiting events in which members get one-on-one time with company representatives.  
LBSA also collaborates with other organizations like the Black Business Student Association to hold larger and more diverse recruitment events.
To make sure the organization continues after they graduate, Eckstein and Reyes decided to pass on their leadership roles to underclassmen this semester and serve as advisers to train new leaders for LBSA.
“I think if I were to graduate as the president then once I passed it down, I would not be there to help them and to really essentially put the training wheels on and help them get through these first initial steps.” Eckstein said. 
Temoc Chavero, a junior majoring in business administration, served on the founding executive board in Fall 2018 and this year serves as president of the organization. He said having Eckstein and Reyes as advisers has helped the board members transition into their new roles while still allowing them to make decisions for the organization. 
Chavero said the board records everything it does at meetings and events and trains younger members to lead the organization once the current board graduates.
“[LBSA] had disappeared, and it was a tragedy, so we are being much more sustainable this year so that it’s much easier to pass on the information,” Chavero said. “We want to bring in people from all types of different majors and backgrounds and not only celebrate the Latino culture and not only promote them, but also because ultimately our end goal is to create the next generation of Latino role models.” 
Last year, LBSA received Marshall’s Diversity and Inclusion Awar, and Eckstein received the Most Outstanding President Award. Both Eckstein and Reyes said that when they visit campus several years after graduating, they hope to see the organization grow and thrive. 
 “We do want it to last,” Reyes said. “It should last. It doesn’t make sense for it to not exist … I hope that if I come back in a couple of years, it’s still here.”

Good Karma Cafe at USC has moved to a new location at St. Mark’s Lutheran Church, right across from campus on Vermont Avenue. The popular student cafe was originally located at the United University Church and relocated after the University bought the location at the end of 2017 with plans to renovate the area. 
The cafe, which offers affordable plant-based meals for students in a buffet-style setting, officially started business in the new location Tuesday after operating out of the United University Church for nine years. 
Head chef and founder  Sarvatma Das said the University has its own plans to renovate the space, and the cafe was told it would only be able to stay temporarily until the renovations took place. With the purchase, Das said the restaurant would also have to pay new insurance and other fees that it hadn’t before. 
“I detected no ill will, but obviously, the University is very much a business … and we don’t fit,” Das said. “They care about insurance [and] lawsuits … so they set certain rules that made it difficult, so we chose to work in a [friendlier] environment, and the St. Marks Church offered that.” 
Das said the restaurant wants to inform students about the new location and noticed that many of the restaurant’s loyal customers have returned. He said the new location, which is closer to off-campus student residences, might attract more customers. 
“I think [the location] is farther away from some of the departments, but it’s closer to where [students] live,” Das said. “We were across the street from the Viterbi [School of Engineering], and a lot of students wouldn’t come because it was a long walk, and now it’s just going across the street. I think the clientele may change a little bit, but already I’ve seen already in the first two days, I would say, two-thirds … of our loyal customers.”
The eatery is focused on sustainable practices and also allows customers to bring their own containers to take food back home. 
“We encourage people to bring Tupperware — first of all, because it reduces the carbon footprint and also because we are very generous with our portions,” Das said. “And we don’t mind if people want to take some home to eat later. Because, again, you guys are busy… [Students] have finals, essays, interviews, etc. We want you to make an educated choice by eating good stuff so [that] your brain develops at the same time that your body.”
The move benefits students like Maria Camasmie, a senior majoring in narrative studies, and Franco Laxamana, a senior majoring in mechanical engineering, who have been regular customers and now live closer to the lunch buffet.
“My housemate and I recently were talking about how we were generally worried about the move for the sake of Good Karma,” Camasieo said. “Obviously, for us regulars who went all last year and the year before, we’ll keep going even if it moved farther [away]. But we were wondering if they would get as much attention from younger students … being off campus and a little bit farther than their previous location.”
Laxamana said he enjoys the pop-up because of its sustainable practices and likes the new location’s spaciousness.
“There’s definitely a context of charitability, almost — I really like that. It’s a good common area to congregate in,” Laxamana said. “It seems a lot more airy in here … as opposed to the last location where it’s a little bit more intimate. That kind of gives a different vibe to it.”
Students also have the opportunity to volunteer at the cafe and, in return, get to eat for free. Simone Augustine, a senior majoring in pharmacology, volunteers at the cafe and likes the friendly community. 
“You can volunteer at any part of the day, so you can come from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. You can come help cook, and then if you come around noon, you can help serve the food,” she said. “If you [volunteer], you obviously get to eat for free and you get to know the community.”

After successful campaigns at the Battle in the Bay Classic in San Francisco and the Milwaukee Tennis Classic, the Trojans are setting their sights on this weekend’s Oracle ITA Masters hosted by Pepperdine University and the Malibu Racquet Club. Junior Daniel Cukierman will be the sole player representing USC in Malibu.
Cukierman took a nontraditional path to USC. Coming from Israel, Cukierman served in his country’s army before beginning his tennis career with the Trojans, making him older than the typical college junior. He also represented Israel at the 2017 Davis Cup, a knockout-style tournament hosted by the International Tennis Federation featuring participants from all over the world, similar to soccer’s FIFA World Cup.
Cukierman, who previously played at Ironi Daled High School in Tel Aviv, Israel, was once placed at No. 525 in singles in the Association of Tennis Professionals’ rankings. He also participated in Israel’s Futures tournament, reaching the singles and doubles finals multiple times. Cukierman is currently ranked No. 8 in the nation in singles via the Intercollegiate Tennis Association.
Last year saw many accomplishments for Cukierman on the court, as he reached his peak singles rank at No. 4 and doubles rank at No. 21 with his partner and former Trojan Tanner Smith. On top of that, Cukierman was named to the All-Pac-12 First Team and was a Pac-12 All-Academic Honorable Mention. 
Cukierman also racked up the most singles wins on the team last season with a record of 34-11 and achieved a 26-11 record in doubles. Although he mainly played with Smith throughout the season, Cuckierman was also paired with sophomore Bradley Frye, former USC player Jack Jaede and senior Riley Smith, posting positive records with all of them. 
At the NCAA Super Regionals, Cukierman lost in both singles and doubles to North Carolina. However, he still reached the singles final at the Southern California Intercollegiate Championships and won last year’s Oracle ITA National Fall Singles Championship. 
Cukierman hopes to build upon his past achievements and maintains similar expectations for Malibu this weekend. Head coach Brett Masi also has high hopes for Cukierman and the rest of his team.
“For these guys, [as] the next tournament comes, it is just small things … in their games that they’re going to be able to do, whether it’s their serve or volleying or whatever it can be,” Masi said. “There are certain assets to their games that they are going to try to strengthen.”
By tightening up  the small parts of their game, Cukierman and his team hope to improve their skills and rack up more wins against tough opponents. The Oracle ITA Masters tournament will have players from all over the country, ranging from rivals like UCLA to East Coast schools like Columbia.
The tournament runs Thursday through Sunday at Malibu Racquet Club.

“’SC has heart!,” screamed redshirt junior safety C.J. Pollard to a group of journalists on his way to the locker room following USC’s upset win over No. 10 Utah. “’SC has heart!”
It was an emphatic end to a terrifically bizarre Friday night at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. I’ve seen the Coliseum when it’s rocking. I’ve sat there in the heat of midday when fans are too lethargic (hungover) to raise two fingers and say “fight on.” But this night was different — the atmosphere could only be described as dreamlike. 
The setup was too juicy to be true. Former Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer — USC head coach Clay Helton’s heavily rumored replacement — would be there alongside the rest of the Fox Sports College Football crew. President Carol Folt, the only person who could make such a move happen, was there just hours after being inaugurated. At halftime, USC’s band spelled out “CAROL” in homage of her visit. They might as well have spelled “CLEAN HOUSE.” 
Reggie Bush, the disgraced Trojan icon, sat to Meyer’s left. It was his grand yet unheralded return to the same field where he became a legend. Although he officially was there in a “work” capacity, to the thousands of fans who chanted his name, he might as well have been getting his No. 5 retired.
The same can be said for the dozens of players who shouted at him in adoration as they ran back to the tunnel. For so many of them, Bush was the reason they chose cardinal and gold. Heck, Bush is one of the reasons I chose to attend USC. So the moment when redshirt freshman running back Markese Stepp dapped up his idol on the sideline after scoring a touchdown wasn’t just a novelty — it was an inevitability. Folt choosing to take a picture with Matt Leinart instead of Bush was icing atop an already infinitely-layered cake. 
There was so much setup. Then the game began. When freshman quarterback Kedon Slovis went down with a suspected concussion, the entire Coliseum held its breath for the second time in the last four weeks, only exhaling when redshirt junior Matt Fink took the keys and drove the offense in his place. 
In my four years at USC, I’ve seen a good team in 2016, a bad team in 2018 and an underachieving team in 2017. This year’s edition of the Trojans can’t be pinned down so easily. Already, they have two wins over Top-25 teams. They also lost to BYU, can’t tackle and have thrown more interceptions than anyone else in the Pac-12. 
The Trojans are either a fun type of bad or an infuriating type of good. Just like Jon Snow, I “know nothing” about the 2019 Trojans. They could easily run the table or lose out, and I wouldn’t be surprised. Well, I know nothing about the Trojans, except this: Pollard was right. They do have an abundance of heart. It’s a welcome change from other teams in the Helton era, who were prone to second-half collapses and rolling over when situations got dire. 
After last season, linebacker and team captain Cameron Smith insinuated that the team lacked fight. This 2019 team can’t stop fighting. Utah drove deep into USC territory eight times, but only scored two touchdowns and were forced to attempt four field goals. 
The Trojans’ defense blocked a kick, forced a fumble on their own 2-yard line and stuffed Utah senior quarterback Tyler Huntley for a turnover on downs. They struggled to contain the edge and rein in athletic quarterbacks, but when backed against their own end zone, USC suddenly turned into the 1985 Chicago Bears. 
The Trojans’ offense is equally resilient. Already, they’ve dealt with two quarterback injuries and both times, the passing game didn’t skip a beat. USC comes in at No. 11 in the nation for passing yards per game, despite not having a single quarterback in the top 70 in yardage. 
Along with losing Slovis, USC was outgained 247 yards to 13 in the run game. The Utes dominated time of possession, holding the ball for twice as long as the Trojans (38:12 to the Trojans’ 21:48). Nonetheless, USC continued putting the ball in the end zone and never gave up on the running attack. They iced the game with five straight run plays for two first downs. 
At every postgame press conference, Helton has invoked the phrase, “So what, now what?” It sounds like a cheesy one-liner from a hopeful coach, but the players have taken it to heart and adopted it as their mantra. It seems to be working. 
USC faces an impossibly tough road ahead, with games against No. 17 Washington, No. 10 Notre Dame, No. 13 Oregon and No. 15 Cal on the horizon. But they have the explosiveness on offense, starpower on defense — looking at sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga and freshman defensive end Drake Jackson — and mettle all around to at least ruin a few more seasons. 
Sign me up. The Trojans will always be fun to watch.

Following its upset win against former No. 10 Utah last Friday, No. 21 USC is preparing to take on No. 17 Washington on the road at one of the loudest venues in college football.
The Trojan defense is coming off what was arguably its best collective performance of the season, despite losing two key players — sophomore cornerback Olaijah Griffin and sophomore safety Talanoa Hufanga — due to injury. The young squad has shown confidence in practice this week as they look to continue building momentum at Husky Stadium.
“I think they just feel more comfortable playing together,” defensive coordinator Clancy Pendergast said at Wednesday’s practice. “Moving into the fifth game of the year, you hope to develop some continuity where the guys are feeling more comfortable playing together. We got a lot of new pieces out there, so I hope it continues to get better.”
Pendergast is now tasked with orchestrating strategies for a defense that may not include Griffin and Hufanga. Griffin left the Utah game early with back spasms and has been limited during practice, while Hufanga entered concussion protocol earlier this week and is dealing with an AC sprain.
USC’s active defensive players — namely true freshman cornerback Chris Steele and redshirt freshman cornerback Isaac Taylor-Stuart — are getting set to fill in any gaps if needed.
“The cornerbacks are ready because it starts from practice, and they were prepared for the games,” Taylor-Stuart said. “We go against great receivers every day, one-on-ones [are] a war. We fight for everything, and [practice] is what prepared them for the game.”
Steele said Pendergast emphasized focus on the task at hand.
“Coach Clancy tells us all the time to just block out the noise, so we’re out there, and we don’t even worry about it,” Steele said, referring to the raucous environment in Seattle. “We’re just focused on our assignment, making sure we’re in the right place at the right time.”
Freshman defensive lineman Drake Jackson and redshirt sophomore safety Isaiah Pola-Mao, two players that shone for the Trojans defensively against the Utes, are expected to continue their impressive play this Saturday.
Pola-Mao came up big when it mattered most on Friday, especially with his crucial third down sack on USC’s one yard line that forced a Utah field goal in the second half. Jackson recorded a safety that gave the Trojans a comfortable two-point cushion.
The Huskies will also come into Saturday’s contest with a 3-1 record, their sole loss coming from Cal in a close 20-19 game during Week 2. Washington’s last contest, a 45-19 road victory against Brigham Young, is sure to raise some eyebrows for USC fans, as the Trojans lost to BYU in overtime during Week 3.
But despite the past, head coach Clay Helton has continued to preach to his players the importance of having a short memory, especially with the mantra, “So what, now what?” which he has uttered at every postgame press conference this season.
With injuries to USC quarterbacks sophomore JT Daniels and freshman Kedon Slovis, the Trojans will place their trust in redshirt junior quarterback Matt Fink to lead them past the Huskies. Fink came in for an injured Slovis after just two plays, and his performance was heralded by USC fans, the media and Trojan legends Reggie Bush and Matt Leinart, who were in attendance.
“I’m always ready,” Fink said after the Utah game, sitting in between Bush and Leinart on the FOX Sports postgame show. “I’ve always wanted a moment like this, where I can come in and perform to the best of my ability.”
Fink and USC will face off against Washington and junior quarterback Jacob Eason Saturday at 12:30 p.m. on FOX.

Cannabis is a budding industry (pun intended!). Weed has undoubtedly boosted economies by creating jobs and increasing financial opportunities in states where marijuana is legal. But as with all competitive and lucrative businesses, cannabis comes at a high price.
In my last column, I talked about how the root of marijuana’s inequity stems from racist propaganda campaigns dating back to the 1920s. Fast-forward to the present day and weed is still entrenched in racial politics, conversations about gentrification, over-policing and poverty. As cannabis intertwines with capitalism, the world of weed will likely remain unequal.
According to the American Civil Liberties Union, even though cannabis consumption is equally popular among all Americans regardless of race, police have continued to disproportionately target and incarcerate people of color. An ACLU study found that Black people were 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana than white people nationwide in 2010. In states with larger discrepancies, such as Washington, D.C., that number rises to 10.
Now, cannabis companies and corporations continue this discriminatory trend, mimicking societal racial inequities and perpetuating wealth gaps. According to The Globe and Mail, in 2017, 81% percent of American cannabis companies were owned by white people, the majority of whom were men. The few women rising up the ranks of the weed industry were also white.
“The top tier of the legal pot industry is run almost exclusively by white men, and retailers, dispensaries and pharmacies nationwide are expected to take in nearly $45 billion in revenue in 2024 from all cannabinoid sales,” wrote Eileen Rivers in an article from USA Today.
When recreational legalization measures were first passed, it was difficult for past marijuana offenders to obtain funding and permits for their business ventures. Doors opened for those already in the medical marijuana business, and loans were reserved for those without past convictions. As a result, wealthy, white CEOs and politicians flooded the market, like former House Speaker John Boehner, who supported the War on Drugs and just last year joined the board of a cannabis company.
It’s a story we know far too well — white people profiting off of what people of color go to jail for. 
Cannabis was first introduced to American mainstream culture by communities of color who used the plant for creative, medicinal and recreational purposes. It was particularly influential for artists in the Jazz Age. As weed enters its second golden age, appropriation and gentrification of the drug threaten to continue and amplify the disenfranchisement of entire people groups — especially those already affected by classism and racism. 
While hundreds of thousands of Black people are still serving life sentences for low-level marijuana offenses, white entrepreneurs are given the opportunity to benefit from the expanding market. And as white business owners are lauded for their seemingly pioneering efforts, making millions in profit, people of color remain incarcerated, even though they were selling small amounts of weed solely to support their families. Ah, the hypocrisy of it all.
And while change has been made, such as through last year’s federal First Step Act — which seeks to curb mandatory minimum sentencing and lessen drug sentences — there is still a long way to go. Only a handful of states have allowed low-level offenders to expunge, or clear, their marijuana records. Even fewer states have granted equity and licensing programs, which provide loans and other assistance, to former drug dealers entering the legal market. 
A complex interplay of racism and anti-poverty sentiment continues to shape weed culture. And as we dismantle the power structures surrounding weed through decriminalization, we must also reopen doors that have been previously closed to communities of color.
To be blunt, weed was never just about weed. It has always been about politics, culture, race, class and the unequal systems which govern all of these. Once cannabis entered mainstream consciousness, it was immediately politicized and radicalized, and its negative perceptions were effectively tied to brown and Black communities. 
White entrepreneurs have a moral responsibility to use their power, wealth and privilege to call for change and lobby Congress for the federal expungement of records. 
And as consumers, we should support local weed shops that give back to the community.

Etienne Kabwasa Green, known as Kabwasa in the rap game, is a senior majoring in visual anthropology with a minor in communication design — but his true passion lies in music. Since growing up in Watsonville, Calif., music has played a major role in Green’s life. 
“I grew up in a family that pushed music a lot,” Green said. “Even when I was really little, I started messing around on GarageBand … then in high school, I did mixtapes and put them on SoundCloud. Finally, when I got here to USC, I met some people in the music school, and from there I was a little bit more directed and started putting music on all the other platforms and working with producers and sound engineers and all that stuff. 
“The past three years have been the [most] serious … of my music career.”
Since coming to USC, music has become Green’s priority. Green’s music is a genre of rap with elements of R&B, soul and trap, allowing him to add his own personal flair to each track. Although rap is his greatest love, his father influenced his music style by having Green listen to funk, soul and other genres. This helped with his collaboration on Digital NEST’s short film “Service With a Smile,” where his single “Worker’s Truth” showcased such musical blends. 
“I always liked rap the most,” Green said. “I like high-energy music. [But] I don’t think I was initially introduced to rap. My dad, when I was younger, showed me funk … and I really liked that … When I found rap, I was immediately drawn to that. I sing, and I have a falsetto voice that helps, so I started to tie the singing into the rapping. So I made a jazz-rap, kind of R&B-ish-rap combo.”
Green is always working on multiple genre-bending projects, but there are times when he has to focus on school when he would rather be making music.
“For me, it’s definitely important that I finish through and get my degree,” he said. “But at the same time, if there are opportunities in music, I don’t usually hesitate to take those opportunities because I’m lucky enough to know where my passion lies.”
Kabwasa said he has an exciting array of projects in his sights, both as a soloist and with fellow Trojan artists. He is currently working with Yasin on a single called “What U Need” that will release Oct. 4. 
Green met Yasin during Gearfest, a music festival hosted by the Black Student Assembly. Green performed with rapper Clarence the Kid, while Yasin performed with USC’s 24kGoldn. 
“Later on, I saw Yasin again, and basically he said that we should link up and try to make a song together,” Green said. “We went and recorded the song over the summer, and it’s been ready for a long time, but now it is finally in the works of getting out.”
Besides striving to improve his craft, Green hopes to make a personal statement with the content of his music. His two middle names, Nkumabui (Congolese name meaning “leader of the people”) and Kabwasa (meaning “crown”), give  him the motivation to inspire others. 
“If I could take two different feelings that I want people to get — especially people I want to represent, like minorities — I want people to feel positivity [and] joy from my music and also at the same time, pride and power,” Green said. “If I could bring these two things to people, then I think my music has done its job.”
Above all else, Green hopes to represent his hometown in a positive way. 
“Definitely where I grew up in Watsonville, that culture comes out in my music I feel like more than anything,” Green said. “I definitely want to keep it that way because I feel like it’s a place that deserves some representation and a voice.”

USC is the No. 18 school in the nation according to the Wall Street Journal/Times Higher Education 2020 rankings, joining the ranks of the Ivy League, top technological institutions and prestigious liberal arts colleges from around the country. But USC has one defining characteristic that distinguishes it from every other school in the top 20: an honors college. 
The McCarthy Honors Residential College is a residential living community for first-year students located in the newly built USC Village. Housing approximately 500 merit scholarship recipients, the “vibrant, tight-knit community of scholars” all “share a commitment to rigorous intellectual and academic achievement.” According to Residential Education at USC, the building boasts state-of-the-art architecture evocative of the quintessential East Coast college look and houses a “magnificent” honors dining hall. Rather than dealing with communal bathrooms, students enjoy private bathrooms in their air-conditioned suites. Along with multiple study rooms, lounges and a laundry room on each floor, the exterior consists of “two spacious landscaped courtyards” with “luxury outdoor furniture.” 
Honors colleges are prevalent at schools where there is a wide range of students with different academic abilities and goals. In many cases, “publicly supported state schools often create honors colleges to attract talented students who might otherwise select a liberal arts college or private research university,” according to Best Value Schools. However, USC — a private institution with an 11% acceptance rate — already attracts and accepts academically motivated, engaged and like-minded students. 
According to the Class of 2022 student profile, the middle 50% ACT scores for fall admits ranged from 31 to 35 while the average GPA fell between 3.79 and 4.0. Even receiving a 31 — the lowest score of the class average range —  is the 97th percentile among high school students, demonstrating that most USC students are among the top 3% of scorers on the standardized test nationally. 
So what is the purpose of stratifying high-achieving, academically inclined students in their first year from fellow equally motivated students? 
Located at USC Village, McCarthy is the only freshman residential college located off the main campus grounds. Some of the most populous freshman living communities, such as New North, Birnkrant and South Residential Colleges, are on the other side of campus, isolating McCarthy from other freshman dorms, hang-out spots and activities. 
In addition to how it geographically ostracizes some first-year students from their peers, the existence of an honors college creates a hierarchy among students, which is problematic at an elite institution. Once students make it through the competitive college admissions process and arrive at USC, the University should not continue to compare them to one another, as it is detrimental to students both within and outside of McCarthy. Every student adds a unique touch to the greater USC community, and no first-year student should be considered more or less worthy than another. 
It is time to phase out the honors college and group all students into residential communities not by whether they have a merit scholarship but by what they want from their freshman living experience. USC does its students a disservice by assigning housing based on something as irrelevant as their merit scholarship status. The freshman experience is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and students should have the freedom to tailor it as they choose — regardless of whether or not that means living in McCarthy. 
Overall, the honors college at USC is unnecessary to first-year students, isolating students within McCarthy and inadvertently degrading those outside it. At the end of the day, isn’t USC already a “vibrant, tight-knit community of scholars?”

Don’t let the haunted exterior fool you: Ground Zero is still open … sometimes. 
There’s no food or drinks at the Ground Zero Performance Café, despite the ads depicting tea and coffee in the darkened windows. The building stands skeletal, buried between the dorms of South Residential College. Otherwise dead during the week, it revives zombie-like for weekly Open Mic Nights; on Mondays from 9 to 11 p.m., the space fills with the rustlings of a pitifully small crowd which grows ever scarcer as the night advances — unsurprising when it’s the same four acts each week, and there’s nothing edible to incentivize students into coming. 
Before 2017, Ground Zero functioned as both a performance space and an actual café, serving coffee, tea and snacks, but most importantly — their famous milkshakes. However, the student-run business closed that year for renovations and has yet to return to its former glory. As reported by the Daily Trojan, the year-long remodel was originally set to include improvements of the coffee bar and the installation of bathrooms. However, a lack of food credentials and general inaction on the University’s part left Ground Zero a shell of its former self. 
Sept. 11 to to early November — otherwise known as USC’s reassignment period — witnessed an exodus of students desperate to make other living arrangements. From where did they flee? South Residential College’s dorms: Pardee Tower, Marks Hall, Marks Tower and Trojan Hall. What the buildings lack in air conditioning, they make up for in shortage of room and overall mediocrity. EVK — quaint as it is — doesn’t compare to upper-crust Parkside and Hogwarts-esque USC Village Dining Hall. And for these luxuries, students pay an arm, a leg and $4,808. 
For McCarthy Honors Residential College, there’s USC Village. For Parkside Residential Colleges, there’s outdoor seating, firepits and proximity to campus restaurants. Ground Zero is the only thing South has — and it amounts to an utter joke. 
Having entrusted USC with the keys to both their futures and bank accounts, students deserve some level of parity, regardless of their dorm situation. Otherwise, the University is swindling money from students’ pockets with unequal levels of return. 
This behavior is unsurprising given the University’s history of unethical conduct. In addition to the ongoing admissions investigation, USC has recently been accused of coercing restaurants Rance’s Chicago Pizza and BBCM into above-market leases under fraudulent pretenses. While the lawsuit has yet to reach its conclusion, the implied pattern of criminality doesn’t do USC’s struggling image any favors.
USC owes it to the student of South Residential College to establish a semblance of equality — and Ground Zero’s restoration is the first step. Not only could the addition of food items increase student jobs and traffic to an otherwise desolate area, but it would return much-needed pride to South students. 
Admittedly, not everyone can have the best. But at a university where attendance costs total a gigantuan $77,459 per year, there should be a certain expectation of quality.
