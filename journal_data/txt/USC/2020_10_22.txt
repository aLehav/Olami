Using individualized music therapy, SoundMind is an innovative application and Trojan-founded company that uses research-driven technology to provide mental health support to PTSD victims. The app’s beta version, launching in early 2021, will be first intended for frontline workers to help combat stress brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The app will then expand in the second edition with more features and include more audiences such as military veterans  and Black and Indigenous people and people of color.
Joining the military at 17, SoundMind CEO Brian Femminella witnessed firsthand the mental health difficulties that military personnel face. After one of his closest friends lost the majority of his memory after an accident training overseas, Femminella was inspired to help victims of traumatic brain injury and PTSD.
Following his service, Femminella started at USC in 2018, where he conducted research with  Thornton School of Music professor Scott Spencer for two years. In their research, Femminella studied music therapy’s ability to counteract the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and thanatosonics, the experiences that erase the boundary between sound and violence, publishing over three different studies. 
In their studies, Spencer and Femminella focused on the idea of sound in battle and the lingering effects of sound in the form of PTSD. Experimenting with this idea, they tested the ROTC team’s 2-mile run performance to assess if their performance changed when listening to music while running. According to their findings, there was a significant increase in performance, proving their theory that music can have a beneficial impact on people in the military.
“After doing all of that work and hearing testimonials and seeing our close college friends go through an immense amount of stress and now with COVID, we decided to start the company,” said Femminella, a ROTC member and junior majoring in intelligence and cyber operations and political science. “I really chose to start the company on the grounds and the fact of, there’s now more time than ever where there’s anxiety, increased stress, depression.”
Founded in January by Femminella and current COO Travis Chen, the two were later joined by Jason Silberman, SoundMind’s chief product officer and app developer. In the company, Silberman focuses on  iOS development, Chen directs the business end and Femminella oversees the entire operation and works on outreach. 
“Brian and I are both — and Travis — all are very strong minded people and I think that works out really well because we’re both happily will tell each other that they’re wrong and are OK with being told we’re wrong and will then talk it out and come to a conclusion that we can all agree to,” said Silberman, a junior majoring in computer science/business administration, “and I think it works better that way because we all come from very different backgrounds and have differing opinions and expertises.” 
Their team also includes juniors Andrew Clark, who is majoring in business administration, and Jonathan Joei, who is majoring in film and television production, who focus on marketing and media to spread SoundMind’s story.
According to Femminella, SoundMind differs from similar applications in that the software and interface design is individualized to the user. The biggest feature on the application is the composer, which, similar in concept to Tinder, allows users to swipe left and right on various soundscapes to filter through sounds and create an interactive, personalized experience. Sounds featured on the app include musical instruments such as piano or guitar with ambient noises playing in the background, such as birds chirping or wind flowing. 
“If you don’t like one of those sounds, you could hold it and you could swipe it away, and if you don’t like the entire soundscape, you could shuffle it or if you love it, you can save it,” Femminella said. “So why is that different? Because it creates an individualized aspect to music that is missing from the market. It allows users to even have that little bit of interactivity.” 
Femminella also said there will be a binaural beats visual section, which allows users to have different feelings such as relaxation or concentration depending on the different sound frequencies of the beats. The app will also feature games to exercise different brain functions to help those who struggle with memory recognition, depression or anxiety. Additional features include mood tracking using color schemes, a section for support groups and a rapid response button to contact loved ones and even 911 in an emergency. 
Spencer noted that Femminella has embraced an inherently interdisciplinary approach, which has resulted in stable and structured success.
“Here is a project that is doing real, tangible good,” Spencer said. “This is what research should be trying to achieve — making the world a better place. Brian envisioned a project that could be a solid and logical step in tackling a much bigger problem.” 
Chen said that the market for SoundMind’s work is undeniably substantial. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America,  47.7 million adults, about 21.6% of the U.S. population, are affected by PTSD or anxiety. In addition, 1.5 million Americans sustain a traumatic brain injury each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. According to a PR Newswire study, the total global market value of mental health applications is set to reach about $4 billion in 2027.
“Obviously COVID-19 has definitely shown that mental health is so, so important. Corporations are turning their heads and their priorities also into mental health resources for their employees and for their students at university levels,” said Chen, a senior majoring in international relations global business. “We really think that this is going to be an important space to enter into and all three of us on this call have personal stories of why we’re doing this.” 
USC alumna Priya Rana Kapoor, who received her masters in marriage and family therapy and currently serves on the USC Alumni Association Board of Governors, met Chen and Femminella through their association with Society 53. Since then she has been a close mentor of the SoundMind team due to her previous experience at USC Keck Hospital’s neuroscience department.
“They have incredible passion for their app but also for helping this underrepresented or underserved community, and they really care about the product and what they’re going to put out into the world and how they’re going to help people,” Kapoor said. “And so that’s really what gets me.”

After he was ruled offside in a match against Arsenal on Saturday, a frustrated Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero put his arm around the referee while complaining about the call. The referee, Sian Massey-Ellis, is one of the growing number of women refereeing professional sports. 
Regardless of Agüero’s intentions, his actions were inappropriate. Women are not only becoming referees across professional sports, but they are rising to prominent positions as coaches and executives in a traditionally male-dominated field. As they do so, women in all positions deserve far more respect than what was demonstrated by Agüero.
Just recently, the world watched as the Los Angeles Lakers brought home an NBA championship led by Finals MVP LeBron James. Although the spotlight seemed to be on James for being such a forceful leader on the court, another leader was also making history. That night, Jeanie Buss became the first woman owner of an NBA franchise to win a Finals championship. 
Without Buss’s leadership, there may have never been a Lakers team worthy of playoff contention this season. Working through struggles in front office positions in recent years, Buss’s determination prevailed as she stuck to her guns to keep Rob Pelinka, the team’s general manager, on staff). This move would eventually lead to his important acquisition of superstars James and Anthony Davis. 
Successful leadership from women can be seen from the president of an organization to the assistant coach positions. Becky Hammon has demonstrated her knowledge of the basketball game as an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs since 2014. 
In “An Open Letter to Female Coaches” by Pau Gasol in The Player’s’ Tribune, he firmly writes, “I’m telling you: Becky Hammon can coach. I’m not saying she can coach pretty well. I’m not saying she can coach enough to get by. I’m not saying she can coach almost at the level of the NBA’s male coaches. I’m saying: Becky Hammon can coach NBA basketball. Period.”
Gasol, a potential future NBA Hall of Famer, said he has been coached by some of the greatest minds in basketball from Phil Jackson to Gregg Popovich, yet Hammon exhibits an IQ for the game worthy of being in the same conversation. If a legend like Gasol can say without a doubt that Hammon can guide a successful team, I am not just hopeful, but confident we will see more great minds of women like her come to prominence in the league. 
Hammon and Buss are just two outstanding women achieving success in men’s professional sports. These two have the ability to increase excitement surrounding not just women in the NBA and NFL but women’s sports themselves. 
As a younger generation looks to put even more energy into women’s sports, I am in awe of the talent from my own age group. Young NBA and WNBA stars Tyler Herro and Sabrina Ionescu are equally amazing. 
In her senior season at the University of Oregon, Ionescu became the first player in NCAA history to tally 2,000 points, 1,000 assists and 1,000 rebounds in a collegiate career. 
Seeing the power that women have had within sports, women as referees deserve much more respect than Sergio Agüero exhibited this past Saturday. From president to coach to player, excellence among women in all areas of all sports is evident. I believe as younger generations of women build legacies similar to their role models before them, leaders such as Jeanie Buss, Becky Hammon and Sabrina Ionescu will soon be everywhere in men’s and women’s sports. 
Women role models do not have to have the accolades like those mentioned above. They can be found even in those younger than yourself, like my sister Greta. As I continue to find success at USC in volleyball, I will always be first to express my pride in my sister’s game in high school basketball and rugby. Beyond the natural competitiveness between siblings, I find a competitiveness and dominance in her game that I can learn a lot from. 
Looking forward, I am excited to learn from not only my sister’s game but any women athletes who have a competitive edge that I can build into my own.

The Undergraduate Student Government presented a resolution Tuesday designed for Black and Indigenous students and students of color at USC. The resolution is meant to support marginalized students who attend the predominantly white institution and calls for the University to denounce “acts of discrimination and bias perpetrated” against them.
Created by Sen. Lennon Wesley III, the resolution states that with marginalized students making up 30% of USC’s incoming Class of 2024, the University has an obligation to “ensure these communities equitable opportunities for success in their education.” According to the Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace cited in the resolution, Black and Indigenous students and students of color have faced increased incidents of racism during online instruction.
“It genuinely pains me and genuinely hurts me to see a lot of things going on within our community … when it comes to BIPOC students, how they’re being treated,” said Wesley in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “There are certain actions that needed to be taken as soon as possible for us to really get to a place where we can appreciate everyone in our USC community … and I feel like that’s a little difficult for BIPOC students as of this moment.”
Although the “Stronger than Hate” initiative launched by President Carol Folt is meant to combat biases and discrimination in the USC community, the resolution calls for USC to partner with USG to create a separate campaign to address the discrimination and biases affecting Black and brown community members. The resolution also urges USC to increase awareness of resources such as the Office of Equity, Equal Opportunity and Title IX. 
The resolution also calls on the University to acknowledge the experiences of low-income, Black and Indigenous students and students of color outside of cultural holidays or heritage months. Wesley said USC should also partner with local businesses and organizations that support Black and Indigenous people and people of color.
Katelyn Lee, USG’s cChair of the Committee on Academic Affairs, Katelyn Lee also submitted a resolution calling for the University and professors to provide financial transparency regarding the cost of textbooks and other course materials.
According to the resolution, students often refrain from purchasing textbooks from the USC Bookstore, with costs averaging around $1,200 for the academic year, because they often don’t know what materials they’ll need until the semester begins.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Lee also said the lack of communication between professors and the USC Bookstore has contributed to the issue of financial transparency due to instructors being unable to provide timely information on textbooks. To mitigate the issue, the resolution calls on USC to take active steps to ensure instructors provide information on required and recommended materials to the bookstore at least six weeks prior to the start of the semester and reflect the information on the University’s Web Registration site.
To remind instructors to provide this information, the resolution also looks to urge the Provost’s Office to send a memo eight weeks prior to the start of the semester to those who have not submitted their list of required or recommended materials. 
“[Students are] left unaware of what books we’re required to purchase or rent for our courses until one to two weeks before the start of the course,” Lee said. “I [want] this resolution to bring more attention to this affordability issue and [hope] that instructors will increase their financial transparency so that students are able to minimize cost by viewing the books list ahead of time and then change their courses around, or at least have extra time to prepare for these costs, especially during this time when there’s more need due to COVID.”
Several members of the USG Senate also debated the appointment of ex-parliamentarian Andrew Fowler to the Senior Executive Aide role. Senators such as Sen. Julian Lin and Wesley respectively raised the issue of Fowler’s frequent absences at meetings and relationship with former Sen. Isabel Washington. Following text messages that revealed Washington and her colleague Nathaniel Manor — the former USG assistant director who would have succeeded Washington but was later barred from joining the Senate — engaging in racist and xenophobic rhetoric, Washington resigned in early July.
Despite the concerns, Fowler was approved with a 10 vote majority with two senators abstaining. Other appointments included students such as Anna Rodriguez and David Martinez for the Elections Commissions and Rohit Bolla and Jackie We for the Communications Department. 
The Tenant Protections Resolution, created by USG Committee Chair for External Affairs Chris Perez and Graduate Student Government Director of External Affairs David Angel, passed unanimously. Through the resolution, USG will call on the Los Angeles City Council to consider policies that allow college students to cancel their leases and receive rent relief during the coronavirus pandemic. 
While Angel knows the resolution itself will not change current policies, he told the Daily Trojan he hopes it will help pressure the city council to support students. Although conversations have begun with the council members, Angel also said USG looks to construct a petition and create a coalition of universities and colleges in Los Angeles to further incentivize the council to take action on the issue. 
With the approaching spring semester, Angel also said they are looking to work with the University to be more transparent in its communication of reopening plans, which led many students to sign leases near campus expecting a hybrid education in the fall. 
“Ultimately, the goal is to find some sort of avenue, whether it be at the university level, at city level or the state level, to help students get out of their leases, or at least take some of the burden off from housing insecurity,” Angel said after the meeting. “We’re just going to keep pushing until … we can actually change something to alleviate that burden on students.”

During his acceptance speech for Top Latin Artist at the Billboard Music Awards earlier this month, reggaeton singer Bad Bunny dedicated his award to a perpetually undervalued group in the Latin music industry: Latinx women. 
“I want to dedicate this prize to women around the world, especially Latinx and Puerto Rican women. Without you, nothing would exist. Nothing. Not music, not reggaeton. Nothing,” the Puerto Rican artist said. Continuing in Spanish, he called out misogyny: “Stop sexist violence, stop violence against women. Let’s educate right now, in the present, to have a better future.”
Bad Bunny is known for challenging Latinx stereotypes of masculinity with his penchant for pink suits and painted fingernails. But the artist failed to credit Boricua singer Nesi as a featured artist on his hit single “Yo Perreo Sola” despite his message on machismo and misogyny. While he brought Nesi out to perform her parts during his Billboard performance, Bad Bunny’s lack of respect for Nesi and his collaboration with primarily male artists is more telling of the industry overall. 
Male acts dominate the 2020 Latin Grammy nominations, with urban artists J Balvin, Bad Bunny and Ozuna earning the most nominations, respectively. Only five women, including flamenco trap singer Rosalía and reggaeton artist Karol G, across 53 categories, earned more than one nomination. 
This awards season reflects a pattern of gender inequality in the Latin music industry. Ruidosa, a festival organizer and Latinx feminist platform, analyzed more than 500 categories during 2017’s major Latin music awards, including the Latin Grammys, the Latin Billboards and the 40 Principales Awards. The study found that women were both grossly underrepresented in nominations and won awards at lower rates than their male counterparts. Women received only 14% of nominations in 2017, with men and gender diverse bands earning 76% and 10%, respectively. Of the award winners, women made up just under 12% compared to men earning 82%. 
Even the most iconic female artists experienced pervasive sexism in the Latin music industry despite their success. Although she’s now a household name, Mexican American pop artist Selena Quintanilla dealt with rampant sexism in the ’90s. Working in the male-dominated Tejano genre, Quintanilla initially struggled to break into the industry, with machismo radio programmers refusing to play her music. Despite the discrimination she faced, Quintanilla ended up dominating the Latin music charts. Billboard recently ranked Quintanilla third on the “Greatest of All Time Latin Chart,” behind Enrique Iglesias and Luis Miguel. 
While female representation is abysmal in mainstream pop music, it fairs even worse in reggaeton music, a genre that’s disproportionately more male than female. Reggaeton, which originated in Puerto Rico in the late ’90s, is one of the most popular genres in Latin music. Reggaeton fuses Jamaican reggae and dancehall rhythms with Latin American genres and Spanish rap lyrics. The genre, created by Black artists and producers, is now dominated by light-skinned and white male stars like J-Balvin, Bad Bunny and Anuel AA who fail to recognize the genre’s Black pioneers. 
But Afro-Latina singer Ivy Queen made a name for herself in the early 2000s as a reggaeton artist who helped pave the way for the genre. Her third album, “Diva,” is widely considered to have been vital in exposing reggaeton to the mainstream public. While a few female reggaeton singers such as Karol G and Natti Natasha have broken through on Latin charts in recent years, Ivy Queen confronted sexist stereotypes in the genre in its infancy. 
Male reggaeton singers rarely receive criticism for their lyrics that reduce women to sex objects, but female artists continue to face hostility for freely singing about consensual sex and pleasure. Ivy Queen’s music challenges the values ingrained in Latin American society that women should be chaste and pure. One of her biggest hits, “Quiero Bailar,” an ode to women who embrace their sexuality on the dancefloor, became the first Spanish-language track to reach No. 1 at an American station in Miami and won her a Billboard award. Her mainstream success as a female reggaeton artist was an anomaly for many years before the genre’s resurgence in the late 2010s. 
In response to the lack of reggaeton and trap artist nominations at the Latin Grammys in 2019, a slew of male artists spoke out against the Latin Recording Academy for disregarding an essential genre of Latin music. The Latin Grammys, under pressure, featured three new categories in 2020: Best Reggaeton Performance, Best Rap/Hip-Hop Song and Best Pop/Rock song. Now, male reggaeton artists completely dominate the nominations, with female artists woefully underrepresented. In the future, I hope that male artists can find the same passion advocating for reggaeton music and apply it to the women who continue to revolutionize the genre.
