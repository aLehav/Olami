Barely a month after it opened in the University Village — days before its grand opening — the owner of 21 Choices already doesn’t know where the branch will be in two years.
But Gudu Husson’s decision to open a store at the UV — which is set to be demolished by 2012 under USC’s Master Plan — brings into question whether the branch will still be around in two years.
Mike Lee | Daily Trojan
USC own the University Village, and plans to redevelop the land as part of its Master Plan, a
framework for the physical development of campus and surrounding areas during the next three decades
Yet Husson, owner and founder of 21 Choices, said the company simply wanted to establish the store’s brand, create a fanbase in the USC area and build credibility so that students would want to come back.
“We’re hoping and working [so] we get to stay here, to serve the students and the people in the community,” Husson said. “We want people to want us to stay here.”
Erin Moya, creative director of 21 Choices, said the company was aware of the Master Plan and had a timeline regarding the store’s operations in mind.
“The reason we started here and now was to get our foot in the door with USC,” Moya said. “We came here assuming we would be busy enough to justify a two-year project. Things are going as expected.”
While the company isn’t certain where they will be setting up after the demolition, Husson said they would be staying in the USC area.
“We know we want to stay either some place on campus or right off … We want to show USC that we are catering to the students so that we can get the best spot when the new places open,” Moya said.
21 Choices hopes to be even more of a presence on or near the UV after the reconstruction is completed, and be able to cater to both students and the surrounding community, he added.
The university administration said it would be working with current tenants — including 21 Choices — to negotiate which stores eventually come back to the new UV after the reconstruction is completed.
“We hope to try to assist tenants to find other locations and we give them improvement allowances,” said Kristina Raspe, associate senior vice president for real estate and asset management at USC.
The allowances are allotted amounts of money given to current tenants on case-by-case basis that would assist them to rebuild at the new UV, Raspe said.
21 Choices has already begun serving customers since its initial opening on Aug. 27, and a number of students who have visited the store say they would want it to remain even after the demolition.
“I think a lot of students would be sad to see it go because it has a lot of support,” said Allen Li, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “I hope they will be back.”
Lauren Rickert, a junior majoring in business administration, said she felt the store offered a different option for students who go to the UV.
“It’s very clean and new here. It is appealing to the USC student because they are raising the bar. People feel safe here,” said Rickert. “[After the demolition] I’m sure they will put it somewhere else or put another yogurt place somewhere.”

As employment rates drop, attendance at USC’s “Pink Slip networking parties” has skyrocketed.
The first “Pink Slip networking party” — a networking event for USC alumni sponsored by the Alumni Association — had about 100 alumni attendees. But just three months later, about 500 alumni crowded into the venue at the Remedy Lounge in downtown  to exchange resumés and attend career-oriented workshops Thursday night.
Making connections · About 500 alumni exchange resumés and attend workshops at a Pink Slip networking party at the Remedy Lounge, downtown. Attendance increased 500 percent from the first event. - Ben Rolnik | Daily Trojan
“These are essentially networking events for alumni seeking job search or career placement advice,” said Scott Mory, associate senior vice president for alumni relations. “We decided to start the parties because there was an interest among alumni.”
The program, which is open to all USC alumni, was started as a joint effort between the alumni association and Scott Turner, associate director of USC Marshall Alumni Career Services.
Peter Giulioni, executive director of Marshall’s Keenan MBA Career Resource Center, said the economy caused the attendance increase.
“The economy is horrid; [many] are unemployed and some of those people are going to be Trojans,” Giulioni said. “Unemployment is devastating both economically and personally and what better resource than the Trojan family helping alums review resumés and developing job searching strategies?”
Ginger Van Hook, an alumna from the Annenberg School for Communication who attended the Pink Slip party, said the event appealed to her because it was a “new way to recruit.”
“It was a completely different venue than I usually expect USC Alumni Association events to be,” Van Hook said. “I like it — it emphasizes networking in a fast-paced environment and that kind of environment is the way the world is now.”
At the party, alumni attended workshops about making themselves more marketable for the job search. They also went to one-on-one, 10-minute sessions with career counselors who saw their resumés and made suggestions on how to improve them.
“The 10-minute session was really beneficial,” said Ryan Dudasik, who majored in political science at USC. “They took my resumé and gave great advice on making it more specific, which is what you need in this economy.”
Some attendees came not to work on resumés or find a job in the Los Angeles area, but to bounce employment ideas off other unemployed Trojans.
“I’m hoping to leave Los Angeles and move to Seattle,” said Kathleen McElhenny, who recently lost her engineering job. “It’s always good just to talk to people who are in the same situation because they can have good ideas.”
This event was only geared toward USC alumni because current seniors and other students already have networking opportunities through the Career Planning & Placement Center, Mory said.
Despite these networking opportunities, some seniors still feel nervous about the job market ahead of them.
“I think we feel nervous about the job market regardless of the alumni parties because the job market is really bad,” said Crystal Cheng, a senior majoring in business administration. “It would be nice if more of those events were held on campus and seniors could go so that we can get to know the alumni on a more personal level.”

Akm Alam has owned the Quik Pix photo and camera shop in the University Village for nearly 28 years.
But now, Alam is just one of several tenants in the USC-owned UV who might be forced to close up shop in response to hard economic times.
Slow day · Store owners at the University Village say business has been declining and fewer students have been visiting. Many owners say they may be forced to go out of business. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan
“Business has been very, very bad,” Alam said, noting that last September is when he first noticed a decline in customers.
The combination of a national economic downturn and a decreasing number of student visitors has hurt store owners in the UV tremendously.
The school has not yet noticed this trend, according to Katherine Logan, assistant director of leasing for University Real Estate.
“Our vacancy rate last year was 7 percent, which was very low,” Logan said.
But Alam believes the university has yet to notice how many tenants are struggling. Many tenants are barely afloat, but can’t close down because they are locked into leases until the end of 2010. But Alam insists he’s not the only one who is fighting to stay open.
Soon after 2010, it may be that few of these stores are still around, anyway. As part of USC’s Master Plan, a complete renovation of the shopping center is scheduled.
A current draft plans for a “mixed-use residential University Village” that includes space for academic buildings, housing for as many as 1,000 students, retail space and a boutique hotel with 700 beds.
These changes will completely alter the face of the UV. The owner of Village Nutrition, known by his customers as Mr. B, said he expects these changes will eventually force him out of his space.
“I’ll go into imposed retirement. Most of us will be priced out of business,” he said. “Luckily I’m kind of old now and I need to retire.”
Mr. B’s said his store, a vitamin and supplement shop, is already faltering as a result of the recession.
“Most merchants are not faring well, at least not the ones who I’ve talked to,” Mr. B said.
He attributes poor business to both the economic recession and the changing customer base in the UV.
“The students are no longer the main market for most of these stores,” he said. “Either the students don’t like shopping around here or the quality isn’t up to their standards.”
Alam has noticed a similar trend at his photo shop. He said that although students once made up around 90 percent of his customer base, they make up only about 50 percent today. And his business is hit especially hard during winter and summer breaks when students leave campus.
“Business is based on the students,” he said. “When you lose it, you’re dead. You’re paralyzed.”
Logan said the UV is aimed both at students and at members of the community. When deciding on new lessees, she said, her department tries to find a balance between stores that cater to students and community members.
“Anyone that expresses an interest and will fit into the tenant mix, we will consider,” she said. “We look at tenants that will service the community, both the students and the community that resides around the shopping center.”
But students said they visit the UV for specific stores, such as the Starbucks, 21 Choices or the bike shop, and don’t branch out to the other merchants.
“I used to shop at Superior freshman year, until I discovered Ralphs,” said Anna Feldman, a senior majoring in economics and mathematics. “[The UV] is a place for errands, it’s not very welcoming.”
Suneesh Sasikumar, a graduate student studying electrical engineering, said he frequents the UV several times a week, but usually just for food or a quiet place to study.
“The food places are what I come for primarily,” he said, noting that on weekends he typically sees families around the shopping center.
Feldman said she thought adding more cafés and outdoor seating areas could help make the UV more student-friendly.
Brian Avila, who lives off Vermont Avenue and does not attend USC, said he likes the UV as is and would not change the types of merchants he finds there.
“I come maybe twice a week,” Avila, 18, said. “It seems pretty well-rounded with the movie theater, ice cream shops and grocery store.”
Maybe the reason these stores are hurting is because they are no longer viable.  No one develops film anymore and the vitamin shop is NEVER open.  When it is, customers will find it disheveled, disgusting and with expired product.   They can’t blame the economy or the University, it’s their own faults.

The USC women’s soccer team swept through the state of Oklahoma this weekend, beating both No. 24 Oklahoma State and unranked Oklahoma 1-0.
The Women of Troy (5-3), featuring a new backline after injuries to senior defender Meagan Holmes and her junior replacement Ashli Sandoval, shut out both opponents and extended their winning streak to a season-high four games.

“We had the baby backline,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said about his defense, which has no seniors and only one junior. “The group just seems to get better with every game.”
USC started off Sunday’s match with impressive form, forcing Oklahoma goalkeeper Kelsey Devonshire to make four saves in the opening seven minutes.
The Women of Troy broke through in the eighth minute when freshman midfielder Courtney Garcia took senior midfielder Marihelen Tomer’s pass and put it past Devonshire and into the net.
USC continued to dominate play until the 35th minute, when sophomore defender Chelsea Buehning was red-carded after making a tackle to prevent a breakaway by Oklahoma.
Playing with one more player than the Women of Troy, Oklahoma outshot USC by 14 to five in the second half. The Sooners were unable to score, however, as USC senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen made five saves to record her second straight shutout.
“Playing with a person down is always tough,” Olsen said. “You have to make adjustments on the field with your formation and how you go about your attack, and we were able to do that.”
USC’s victory over Oklahoma came two days after its upset of No. 24 Oklahoma State, the Women of Troy’s first win against a ranked opponent this season.
USC appeared to have fallen behind just more than 10 minutes into Friday’s match in Stillwater, Okla., when Oklahoma State forward Kasey Langdon took a rebound and shot it into the back of Olsen’s net. The play was whistled for offsides, however, and the goal was not counted.
The score was even for most of the first half, with both teams registering five shots in the period. USC gained the advantage in the 41st minute, though, when freshman forward Samantha Johnson won a loose ball and fired it inside the far post from 18 yards out.
The Women of Troy outshot Oklahoma State nine to three in the second half, but could not add to their lead.
The loss for the Cowgirls was their first defeat at home against a non-conference opponent in nearly nine years.
“Any time you can go away from home, out of region, and beat a team of Oklahoma State’s caliber, it’s a huge, huge result,” Khosroshahin said.  “We still have a lot of growth that needs to be done, but this weekend was tremendous for us.”

The No. 15 USC women’s volleyball team’s winning streak continued last weekend, as the Women of Troy swept both the Portland Pilots (25-22, 25-15, 25-13) and the Fresno State Bull Dogs (25-12, 25-20, 25-13) in their final non-conference games of the season at the Galen Center.
“We’re getting comfortable,” said head coach Mick Haley. “Getting our confidence. The competition wasn’t Pac-10 caliber [last weekend], but both teams played real hard against us. I just think we’re starting to gel and execute better and relax a little.”

USC opened Friday evening’s match against Portland without two of its starters, as Jessica Gysin was nursing a hamstring injury and Kimmee Roleder was out with the flu. But freshman Katie Fuller stepped in to produce a team-high 10 kills, hitting .471 in the match.
Sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams excelled in the game against the Pilots as well, with a total of nine kills, hitting .438 and five block assists.
Sophomore Alex Jupiter continued to post bold numbers on the young season, as she compiled eight kills, nine digs and a career-high seven blocks. Senior libero Alli Hillgren also achieved a season-high of 20 digs for the evening.
After a shaky start in the second set, with USC falling behind the Pilots 4-1, the Women of Troy answered with a 7-2 run and back-to-back blocks to gain the lead. A couple more errors kept the set close until the end when Portland’s 12 errors gave USC the 2-0 set advantage.
Portland’s errors continued to be helpful for the Women of Troy, and with a 7-1 run and two kills by Fuller, USC was able to gain their ninth sweep of the season. Saturday’s run in  with the Fresno State Bulldogs had the same outcome for USC, as it notched its 10th sweep of the season.
The Bulldogs fell to 7-5, as the Women of Troy hit .326 against their foes. Jupiter earned USC 20.5 points, along with 17 kills, eight digs, three service aces and one block, while hitting .452.
Williams continued to excel in Saturday’s game, driving in eight kills and four blocks, and sophomore setter Kendall Bateman landed 36 assists and three blocks.
Geena Urango and Williams started the game with two sharp kills in the first set, and, along with Bateman, nailed down a stuff block to give USC a 9-4 lead. Jupiter recorded two kills, opening a 16-8 USC lead, and the Women of Troy closed out the set with an 8-1 run, hitting .435.
Fuller continued her strong freshman effort by starting the second set with a five-point rally that helped USC gain a 2-0 set advantage. Haley was encouraged by the way Fuller and her freshmen classmates stepped up this weekend to fill in for Gysin’s and Roleder’s absences.
“[Erin] Yoder had a great second game [against Fresno State]. Fuller filled in for Roleder and did a marvelous job,” Haley said. “We also got a chance to use Kelly Irvin. She did a nice job for us also.”
Once again, Jupiter helped USC rack up the points with a kill and an ace on two straight points to tear the third and final set away from the Bulldogs 25-13, giving USC its 11th straight win.
After finishing with an impressive record throughout their first 12 games of the season, the Women of Troy look to bring their success into Pac-10 Conference play next weekend in Arizona. USC will take on Arizona on Friday, Sept. 25, and Arizona State on Saturday, Sept. 26, in what should present two tough matches for Haley’s squad.
“We got a heck of a match from Arizona … and Arizona State,” Haley said. “I expect [both Arizona and Arizona State] to play as well as we can play when we get over there. I expect a big crowd. I expect the matches to be very intense.”

SEATTLE — After making the long walk down a hallway to the visiting locker room, Pete Carroll spoke softly and contritely to the waiting throng of media.
Even the eternal optimist of the coaching world couldn’t find a silver lining after his team’s latest disappointment.
Familiar pain · Senior fullback Stanley Havili hangs his head in disappointment after the Huskies’ 16-13 upset over the No. 3 Trojans in Seattle. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
“We’re not real good right now,” Carroll said. “We weren’t real good last week, either.”
A similar sense of doubt lingered in the Trojans’ locker room following its last-minute 16-13 loss to unranked Washington (2-1, 1-0 Pac-10) at Husky Stadium on Saturday. One week after engineering a fourth-quarter drive to push ahead of Ohio State, No. 3 USC (2-1, 0-1) found itself on the other end of a heroic rally.
Erik Folk kicked a 22-yard field goal for the Huskies with three seconds left, putting Washington on top and securing the team’s first Pac-10 win in more than a year.
Sensing an impending witch hunt, Carroll quickly pre-empted the blame game by taking full responsibility for the loss.
“When you play football like this, your chances of winning are so difficult,” Carroll said. “It goes right to me … I’m not doing a good enough job of making the points of how we win.”
Despite gaining more total yards than Washington, USC’s offense floundered on the heels of three turnovers, all of which came inside the Huskies’ 30-yard line. The Trojans also committed eight penalties for 75 yards and went 0-for-10 on third-down conversions.
“I can’t tell you how disappointed I am that that has not left us,” Carroll said of the recurring penalties. “That needs to get out.”
Aaron Corp, making his first career start in place of the injured Matt Barkley, struggled to find his rhythm within the USC offense. The redshirt sophomore finished with 110 yards on 13-of-22 passing with an interception.
Although Corp was able to connect with a few of his early targets on short passes, Saturday afternoon was filled mostly with regret for the signal-caller.
“I wish I had some stuff back,” Corp said. “I didn’t play well by my standards.”
The final three quarters were a sharp fall off from the Trojans’ hot start. Running back Joe McKnight scored a touchdown on USC’s opening drive and the Trojans’ offensive line opened huge holes that helped spark a slew of long runs.
“Early on in that game, you would have thought we were going to get beat 50 to nothing,” said Washington coach Steve Sarkisian. “They were running the ball up and down the field.”
With the game tied in the fourth quarter, Carroll instructed Barkley to warm up so that he could once again test his right throwing shoulder, which had been limiting him all week because of a bone bruise. But the true freshman, who started USC’s first two contests, was unable to shake off the pain and watched Corp play the last quarter.
USC’s offense showed late signs of life when a 29-yard punt return by receiver Damian Williams and a 34-yard run by McKnight set up the Trojans deep in Husky territory. But USC had to settle for another short field goal from Jordan Congdon, tying the game and putting the ball back in the hands of Washington quarterback Jake Locker with four minutes left.
Locker was a perfect 4-of-4 passing on the deciding drive and threw a 21-yard dart to Jermaine Kearse for a first down on 3rd-and-15. Another key catch by Kearse and a roughing the passer penalty by defensive tackle Averell Spicer gave Washington the ball at the USC 8-yard line, putting the ball well within range of the Huskies’ kicker.
The loss was a bitter reminder of last year for USC players and fans alike. Coming off a landmark win against Ohio State in 2008, the Trojans dropped their Pac-10 opener to Oregon State on the road in stunning fashion.
“We didn’t rise to the occasion,” Williams said. “We’ve been here before, it happened the exact same game last year — different opponent, same situation, same game.”
USC once again finds itself in a 0-1 hole in the Pac-10 race. The emotional weight of the loss would be tough, Carroll said, but the team has no choice but to move forward if it hopes to keep alive its chances at another Pac-10 title.
“This game is dead and gone already. It’s what we do about it that’s important,” Carroll said. “We have to play better football or we’ll be struggling all year long.”
This is quite sad. I am amazed that we did not learn anything given the lessons of the last few seasons. I hear we have the best athletes and a handful of blue-chip 5-star recruits. Talent does not mean you have heart. Corp looked like a deer ready to get run over by a car. Was scared.
Why isnt Mustain playing quarterbac?. He has game and SEC experience (8-0 with Arkansas as a starter). I always make excuses for our team each and every year. Seems we need to get serious and not be arrogant when we play opponents that we are supposed to win.
Pete Carroll is still the man, but he needs to accept that he can not be the lone coaching star. He and his other staff were outcoached by Sarkisian and Holt. I saw Mark Sanchez play with the Jets and wondered why we did not unleash him last year? Why cant we just play offensive football with some confidence? Norm Chow was the man. We need an offensive coordinator like him that has experience and it is not some young guy who Carroll can step on.
In spite of my disappointment, i do realize that these are a bunch of college kids playing the game. They are young but it seems that they seem to lack discipline.
Open up the offensive playbook and play football. Give Mustain a chance as well. Conservative play calling will not win you championships.
I hope we come out stronger versus Cal, Notre Dame and the Oregon schools. What  a stretch. Time to prove yourselves Trojans. We need to fight on and kick some butt.
This means we do not play scared. Hold the ball as if it is your most prized possession. Enough fumbles.
Fight on!

All signs pointed to it.
A week after a huge emotional win, a week of practice swirling with uncertainty, all leading up to a road game against a team nobody thinks has a shot.
Pressure cooker · Washington’s defense kept the heat on USC quarterback Aaron Corp, limiting him to 110 yards and one interception. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
Smelled like trouble.
Looked like trouble.
Man, was it ever trouble.
In what has become a yearly occurrence for USC, the Trojans’ undefeated record was blemished and their national championship hopes put into serious jeopardy at the hands of an unranked Pac-10 opponent, this year courtesy of Washington, 16-13 in Seattle.
Were you shocked? Were you tearing your hair out? Really, we should have sensed this one coming.
To start, the Trojans were coming off the program’s most intense victory in four years after beating Ohio State 18-15 last week in Columbus. The emotional letdown following that game was inevitable, no matter how much USC coach Pete Carroll tried to force his team to get past it.
But other than the emotional aspect, this game was not like the Oregon State debacle of a year ago.
In fact, the Trojans came out and started fast, with their offensive line blowing the Huskies off the ball as if they were tackling dummies. In the first quarter, junior running back Joe McKnight and senior tailback Stafon Johnson ran through holes wider than Lake Washington. The Trojans marched down the field in seven quick plays on their first drive and McKnight sped into the end zone with ease.
Against the Beavers last year, the Trojans were as flat as an old 2-liter bottle of Coke to start the game. Saturday, they came to play.
But so did the Huskies. Behind the heroics of quarterback Jake Locker, the Huskies took the Trojans opening punch and punched back — harder. Suddenly, those holes McKnight was waltzing through on the first drive were sealed by an invigorated Washington defense.
“They just outplayed us,” McKnight said, adding, “Hard work beats athleticism any day and that’s what they did.”
Yes, hard work, even from a football team that was winless last year. Forget the fact that the Huskies lost 15 straight games before beating Idaho last week. Forget that they were 19-point underdogs against the Trojans.
Remember that they are coached by two guys who know every inch of USC’s offensive and defensive playbook.
Washington coach Steve Sarkisian and defensive coordinator Nick Holt, less than a year removed from coaching alongside Carroll at USC, know the Trojans’ schemes on both sides of the ball better than any coaches outside of Heritage Hall. Very rarely in the game — and especially after the first quarter — did a Washington player look out of position.
Carroll gave Sarkisian and Holt their due credit.
“When you really like people, you want good things to happen to them, so I’m happy for them in that regard,” Carroll said of his former fellow coaches.
Now to the elephant in the room — Aaron Corp. Putting the loss entirely on the redshirt sophomore’s shoulders is neither fair nor valid. But he certainly did not help the Trojans’ cause.
He never got into a rhythm throwing the football. He consistently threw into traffic and finally paid for it with his red zone interception in the third quarter.
Corp was undoubtedly disappointed after losing his long-awaited first start.
“I wish I had some stuff back I didn’t play well to my standards,” Corp said.
Remember, however, that the two other costly turnovers USC committed inside Washington’s 35-yard line came on fumbles by Johnson and  redshirt junior fullback Stanley Havili — two plays completely out of Corp’s hands.
“When you play football like this, your chances of winning are so difficult,” Carroll said. “For us to go out there and turn the ball over like that, we fumbled the ball more times than we lost it.”
But that won’t stop people from pondering if Barkley would have done a better a job.
The answer, though, is that he wouldn’t have. Despite Barkley’s heroics a week ago, his statistics were nothing special. He deserved credit for his poise more than his completion percentage against the Buckeyes, so there’s no way of knowing if he wouldn’t have made the same mistakes Corp made on Saturday.
What really hurt the Trojans, however, was the uncertainty throughout the week leading up to the game. Barkley wasn’t practicing, yet Carroll wouldn’t rule him out. Corp said he approached every practice last week as if he was the starter, but that’s just not the same as definitively knowing that you’re going to be the guy.
Carroll, of course, did not say Corp was any less prepared because of it. But he couldn’t deny that his performance was subpar.
“We didn’t throw the ball well today.” Carroll said. “It was obvious. We threw the ball for 110 yards and couldn’t get the ball down the field. We rarely get in that situation.”
So while it’s pointless to argue about how things might have changed had Barkley played, the uncertainty brought about by the true freshman’s injury resulted in Corp not being fully ready to play and the offense being severely out of sync.
The mixture of all these things — an unavoidable emotional letdown after the Ohio State win, a coaching staff that knew all the Trojans’ plays and doubt all week over who would start at quarterback — made for one volatile combination that shouldn’t have blindsided anyone.
Just another shocking USC upset that really was no shock at all.

The story: USC is once again stunned in its Pac-10 opener in the Pacific Northwest, this time falling to Washington in a 16-13 disappointment for the Trojans in Seattle.
Last season’s 27-21 loss to Oregon State was on the tip of everyone’s tongues throughout the week because of the strikingly similar set-ups between the two games. In the end, the results would also be parallel.
Bittersweet · Senior fullback Stanley Havili had the best all-around game for the Trojans with 10 touches for 98 total yards, but his third-quarter fumble at the Huskies’ 12-yard line halted a USC scoring opportunity. - Leah Thompson | Daily Trojan
A familiar formula of self-imposed mistakes helped sink the Trojans on Saturday.
“Last year we killed ourselves with penalties and turnovers,” said redshirt junior wide receiver Damian Williams. “This year we killed ourselves with penalties and turnovers.”
USC’s offense rolled downfield throughout the first quarter to the tune of 111 rushing yards. But the Trojans went 0-for-10 on third downs and struggled to establish a passing game.
“We’ve played games below our standard of play before,” USC coach Pete Carroll said. “We underachieved here today.”
Key play of the first half: With USC marching into Washington territory and with only 18 seconds before halftime in a tie game, Carroll called for redshirt junior Stanley Havili to carry the ball on a 3rd down and 1 on the Huskies’ 29.
Havili was stuffed for a 3-yard loss, allowing the clock to continue running as the Trojans tried to get their kick team onfield.
But with no timeouts, USC couldn’t make the shift quickly enough. Redshirt senior Jordan Congdon attempted a 47-yard field goal that went through the uprights, but referees ruled that the clock had expired before the kick.
Instead of entering the third quarter with a three-point lead, the Trojans had to kickoff to the Huskies, tied at 10.
“When we didn’t make the first down, we went into hurry-up field goal mode and you need more than 20 seconds to get that done,” Carroll said. “We really had no choice.”
Key play of the second half: In the Huskies’ defining 63-yard drive to end the game, Washington junior quarterback Jake Locker came up with several key plays.
His 21-yard pass on a 3rd down and 15 may have been the most important play of the sequence. But Locker’s most impressive pass was his final one.
With his team at the USC 35-yard-line, Locker scrambled to the right and winged a pass down the sideline to sophomore receiver Jermaine Kearse to the 16-yard line. A roughing the passer penalty to redshirt senior Averell Spicer tacked on an additional eight yards for the Huskies.
Locker received heaps of praise from Carroll, who said the junior quarterback came through in the clutch.
“He didn’t surprise me a bit,” Carroll said. “When he had to have it, he made it.”
Havili’s roller coaster: Stanley Havili tallied 10 touches for 98 yards, but the fullback had an up-and-down day.
His biggest folly was a fumble after a short catch. Havili slipped and tried to keep his footing so he could turn upfield but instead lost the ball when the Trojans were in scoring position.
After the game, Havili was apologetic for his turnover.
“I just tried to do too much,” Havili said.
Quote of the game: “I gotta get a little rubber cord or something on him so I can just pull him back myself.”
Washington coach Steve Sarkisian joked after the game about defensive coordinator coach Nick Holt’s overzealousness on Saturday, but a win probably went a long way toward healing the wound.
Holt, who served as an assistant at USC for the last three years, earned a sideline infraction penalty for Washington when he stepped onto the field of play during one of USC’s third-down attempts. The Trojans fell short of their needed yardage, but the penalty gave them a first  down.
USC did not score on the drive, however, allowing Sarkisian to remain lighthearted about the mistake after the game.

The crowd that gathered for David Cross’ pre-book signing Q&A at Book Soup last Thursday was so large that it nearly bled onto Sunset Boulevard. And when the 45-year-old entertainer moved to take his place — sharpie in hand — behind the back-wall register, all of the film geeks, underground comedy buffs, Arrested Development fans, squealing women and plaid-wearing cool kids clutching copies of Cross’ first book-writing attempt, I Drink for a Reason, wound an orderly single-file line between shelves of recommended paperbacks.
The diverse congregation of fans was new for Cross, who never imagined that he would be adding “book author” to his long list of cross-medium comedy accomplishments.
Tough guy · Cross initially struggled to write I Drink For a Reason, his debut humor book that delves into pop culture and social commentary. - Photo courtesy of ID PR
“I’m brand new to the publishing world,” Cross said in an interview. “It’s very much a different experience from anything else I’ve done.”
Starting as a standup comedian in the mid-1980s, Atlanta-born Cross has expanded his offbeat jokes and biting humor into a multifaceted career. Currently, he is most recognizable as the goofy-looking psychiatrist-turned-wannabe-Blue-Man-Group-member Tobias Fünke on HBO’s Arrested Development, but his complete list of accomplishments is more expansive, spanning from one entertainment extreme to the other.
He wrote Emmy-winning sketches for The Ben Stiller Show, created and starred in his own HBO series Mr. Show with Bob and David, picked up bit parts in movies like Cable Guy and Scary Movie 2, recorded three full-length comedy CDs, appeared in music videos for The Strokes and Yo La Tengo and, more recently, has lent his voice to video games such as Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and children’s movies like Kung Fu Panda.
Underneath his extensive Hollywood resumé, however, Cross is still true to his standup roots. He often performs at comedy festivals and is known for popping in on friends’ shows and rattling through an impromptu set. It only seems fair, then, that his venture into the foreign realm of book signings is being coupled with the format most familiar to Cross as he turns his upcoming North American appearances into stops on his first standup comedy tour in five years.
“I just haven’t gone out on tour and done a new hour of material,” Cross said. “And the fact that I haven’t done that in a while and the book is coming out just sort of made sense.”
According to the press release, I Drink For a Reason is Cross’ “first and final book,” an understandable statement given the stress involved with its production. After being approached with an offer by an agent he’d never met, Cross spent seven frustrating months trying to comply with the contract’s anti-humorous fiction clause.
“I started to write stuff like George Saunders … and I was really struggling with it,” Cross said. “It wasn’t my forte and it was harder than I thought.”
So when he approached his editor to ask for an extension, Cross mentioned his months of difficulty trying to write a book of truths. The editor said it was no problem — “Write whatever you want” — and for the next year, the unhindered words of comedy’s king of intelligent randomness began to flow.
“It was like they took off the handcuffs,” Cross says.
The result of Cross’ writing freedom is a humor book that defies the standup-comedian-writes-a-humor-book cliché. It is not a transcription of favorite routines with cool text formatting like George Carlin’s Brain Droppings. Nor is it full of anecdotal memoir notes with supposedly funny commentary, like Ellen Degeneres’ My Point…And I Do Have One. Instead, I Drink For a Reason is 236 pages of pensive essays, stream-of-consciousness rants, pop culture scorn, autobiographical untruths and nonsensical lists written specifically for his literary debut.
The compilation reads less like a well-polished humor book and more like a one-sided conversation where Cross imparts onto readers every overly expanded random thought — and tangental sub-thought — he’s had in the last three years. Although it’s sometimes hard being sucked into the innermost depths of Cross’ brain, the subject matter is relevant and the variety of structure styles is the literary manifestation of his extensive humor experience.
“I wanted to compile a book of a bunch of different types of comedy writing — which I did,” Cross said.
When greeting anxious fans at last week’s book signing, Cross gave no sign of inexperience with the process. Sporting a wooly, graying beard, he confidently signed personal messages into hardcover editions and listened with a smile as people used the opportunity to mention when they last “met” him. With a quintessentially Cross humor book now under his belt, the comedian can again focus on his original love.
“Every medium has its benefits, but in the moment that I’m doing it, standup is always more fun,” Cross said.

Like the band Porcupine Tree, the scene at Club Nokia on Saturday night was difficult to define. The audience ranged from high school students wearing freshly bought band T-shirts to middle-aged men with long hair and long-forgotten dreams of beginning their own rock bands. Despite the differences in age and style, the audience was a powerful force and packed the venue. As the lights went down and the shadowy figures of the band members appeared on stage, it became clear why Porcupine Tree has been playing for more than 20 years.
Hailing from the United Kingdom, Porcupine Tree has released 10 studio albums since it first formed in 1987, and was nominated for a Grammy in 2007. The staying power of the band is clearly connected to its members’ ability to create eye-catching performances that combine music, lights and video. As the band played its set, which was led by vocalist Steven Wilson, film was projected as an accompaniment to the music. Images of haphazardly drawn demons and psychedelic patterns crossed the screens behind the band, creating a whole new sensation for the audience. This experience, while intriguing, was also quite bizarre. The images were hypnotic and slightly unnerving, as some included disturbing depictions of violence. This visual aspect of the concert, however, did not phase the dedicated fans of Porcupine Tree. It only seemed to enliven them more.
Tree people · Porcupine Tree livens up Club Nokia Saturday with its eclectic sound and breathtaking visuals. The band, which formed in 1987 in the United Kingdom, has 10 full-length albums, the most recent of which was released this year. Having experimented with a range of styles throughout the years — including psychedelic, progressive rock and metal — Porcupine Tree’s sound and look is completely its own. - Nathaniel Gonzalez | Daily Trojan
A video of screaming mouths lit up the dark venue as the band played a 55-minute nonstop set complete with songs off of its newest album, The Incident. The music was clearly not meant for the lighthearted and was not confined to one genre. Instead, because of the band’s vast history and experimentation over the years, many different types of music made up each individual track. From sounds that one would associate with the lighter, alternative rock of Jimmy Eat World to the heavy metal of Led Zeppelin, Porcupine Tree drew from a vast array of genres in creating its sound. Using electric guitars, a piano and an acoustic guitar, the band developed a layered sound with a heavy and persistent drumbeat. Wilson spoke, sang and screamed above the instrumentals, allowing the audience a break from typical, ear-piercing heavy metal. This diversity meant that the concert was never static; Porcupine Tree kept the audience guessing and thoroughly entertained.
In addition to the film and music mashup, the lighting added an engaging dimension to the band’s performance. At one point, the venue was darkened as Wilson emerged with a white-lit guitar. The instrument illuminated in the darkness complemented the slow rhythm of the melody. When the beat picked up and the sound transformed into a heavier type of rock, the lights danced and flashed across the stage.
The performance of Porcupine Tree speaks to the band’s maturity and development. With decades of experience performing around the world, the group understands the audience it aims to please and knows how to do so. Through its layer of multimedia, Porcupine Tree caters to the faithful audience it knows will follow.
Additionally, the heavy metal nature of its music is accessible to a newcomer; while it is loud and some headbanging definitely took place in the crowd, it was not overwhelming or suffocating. Instead, the lyrics were decipherable and, in fact, complemented the use of diverse instruments.
Years of experimentation with different genres result in a Porcupine Tree discography that is quite eclectic, making it difficult to wade through 10 albums and become one of the band’s faithful listeners. This difficulty to define the group allows Porcupine Tree to be what it is: a band that is able to try new styles and instruments without fear that fans will stray.

Office parties have a reputation of being a little — okay, a lot — on the awkward side. To borrow a line from Tina Fey’s cinematic masterpiece Mean Girls, these after-hours gatherings are like “seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.” Once the attorneys loosen their ties and take down their hair, things stop being polite and start getting real. The line between work and play gets a bit hazy, but one thing is clear: Mild embarrassment is always in the forecast.
For one Thursday a month, my law firm would hold a social immediately following the 5 o’clock workday. Essentially, a social is the watered-down, Natty Light equivalent of what the rest of the world refers to as a party. Human Resources would send out an email several days in advance, inviting all company employees to come together in the name of mediocre hors d’oeuvres and cocktails.
Eating while chit-chatting with co-workers has fostered some humbling moments. One highly regarded attorney snacked on fresh fruit as he told me about how he dated a pre-Clueless Brittany Murphy in middle school. Midway through the conversation, I noticed some pesky black seeds and a thin layer of red strawberry coating his front teeth. I started slowly moving my tongue back and forth over my teeth with the hope he would catch on and subconsciously begin to mimic my behavior. Soon after, I surrendered, realizing he was oblivious to my charade — that was my cue to politely excuse myself from the conversation.
It’s easy for me to be high-and-mighty and poke fun at the innocent blunders of my co-workers. But that’s not to say I was the picture of flawless office party etiquette.
Not even close.
Early in the summer, the law firm held one of its socials to coincide with the arrival of the new summer associates — law students who work May through August to gain law office experience. The addition of attractive, new employees is always a juicy topic for conversation.
Some of the secretaries and I took it upon ourselves to start an impromptu game of “do, date, or die” that began with the three male summer associates and ended up including every other male and female employee.
For those unfamiliar with this beloved American pastime, one person begins by choosing three people at random. The three people can be whomever — celebrities, friends, co-workers, fascist dictators or any combination thereof. Then the other players select one person of the three they would like to sleep with, one they’d like to date, and the third, often by default, who must make like John Tucker and die.
This is admittedly not an appropriate game to play in the workplace. If you do decide to go against your better judgment and play it, be sure to exercise a little discretion and a hushful tone.
The secretaries and I, however, failed to follow these words of obvious wisdom. Unbeknownst to us at the time, the summer associates heard everything we said. And I mean everything, including: the probable impotence of an elderly lawyer, the in-office exchange of sexual favors between co-workers and the deadly flatulence of the firm’s least favorite attorney. Even the most incompetent lawyer could successfully prosecute us for tactlessness on the basis of  defamation of character.
Another crucial, yet often unclear, matter of propriety is when you should make the great escape. If the social starts at 5 p.m., most people will leave around 6:30 or 7 p.m. at the latest, which gives them enough time to have a drink or two and then sober up before calling it a night.
Those play-by-the-rules employees are the ones you’re rarely sad to see go.
After the wet blankets head home, things begin to get interesting. Attorneys start misbehaving. Some take shots of Patron, some talk about tattoos in unmentionable areas and others argue over the correct equation for a stripper name (first pet’s name plus the street you grew up on vs. birthstone plus favorite ice cream flavor).
Even if the conversation takes a turn for the naughtier, it’s still a chance to bond with a group of people you probably spend more time with than your own family. Got a little something wedged between your teeth? Don’t fret — while it may be hard to look at, it can be endearing. All of a sudden, that hotshot attorney no longer seems like your big, bad intellectual superior.
Exposed the Playboy bunny ink on your hip? Chances are you’re not the only one in the room who has made a fool of himself after one too many appletinis.
All jokes aside, office socials are an opportunity to get to know things about people that wouldn’t necessarily come up in a promotional meeting or over a business lunch with the boss.
Sure, the dialogue can border on inappropriate, but when that immodesty is mutual, it often becomes “your little secret.” So when you pass each other the next morning on the way to the coffeemaker, you nod and give each other a knowing smile.
In the case of uptight vs. down-for-whatever, it is the judgment of this column that any and all disorderly conduct charges should be dropped in the event you choose to let loose instead of playing it safe.

Many diehard print journalists simply cannot stand online news aggregators. Wall Street Journal editor Robert Thomson called them “parasites or tech tapeworms in the intestines of the Internet.” So it should come as no surprise that the Google Fast Flip, the newest online aggregator, has taken a lot of flak in its first week.
Google Fast Flip, which currently has its experimental site running through Google Labs, aggregates news articles from 36 publishers so far and simulates a print magazine — hence the “flipping.”
Lucy Mueller | Daily Trojan
Users are greeted with an organized frenzy of newspaper or magazine screenshots at the homepage. Click on a screenshot, and it will maximize the image. Using the left and right arrows, you can “flip” through the pages of the virtual magazine until you find an article you like. Click on that image, and it takes you to the full article at the original site.
The site’s main caché is that  the pages really do load and flip quickly, despite being media-rich — assuming you have a fast Internet connection. It’s a fairly impressive attempt at translating a news magazine to the virtual realm.
But there are several drawbacks to Fast Flip. With rows of screenshots lining your computer screen, it initially looks a bit suffocating. Furthermore, you can’t really read the headlines of each article clearly in the minimized screenshots. Then again, navigate to The Los Angeles Times or The New York Times page and the beauty of visual search comes to light. For example, the LA Times has subheads running amok alongside images and bulky, irrelevant                                                                                                                                       advertisements, whereas Fast Flip has neat rows of identically sized screenshots from which to choose and trimmed, content-based advertisements running vertically along the sides.
Naturally, print journalists have raised an outcry about the dangers of news aggregators like Fast Flip. It takes readers away from print media, robbing publishers of a chunk of their revenue. But perhaps most disturbing is that Fast Flip and other virtual search engines imitate the style and, in a way, the interface of print journalism. In their view, it may endanger the future of print journalism as a whole by imitating, and perhaps eventually cannibalizing, the industry.
Yet Google claims this initiative is an attempt to help newspapers attract a larger audience and more creatively engage readers in the news. It hopes to bridge the gap between print and online media and even offer publishers an additional income stream (to make up for the revenue lost from print sales). Google splits its advertisement takings with the publishers, forming a partnership of sorts.
But Google must have its own agenda as well. This is business, and Google has found a window of opportunity that it should take advantage of. Launching Fast Flip will help monetize online content and cement Google as the premiere news aggregator on the web.
Diehard journalists should just accept that consumers — whether young adults or baby boomers — have already embraced technology. It was only a matter of time before print journalism fully jumped on the bandwagon. It’s not as if print journalism has remained stagnant for the past decade — newspapers’ online archives of news articles testify to this fact.
Publishers and journalists should have greater foresight and accept that, in essence, consumers are attracted to visually accessible sites. The average online user is already bombarded by a myriad of images every day, but he would still prefer images over plain words. This transition to visual searching seems like an inevitable step for publishers.
To keep pace with the rest of our technologically progressing society, it’s time for journalists to bridge the gap between the print and digital worlds.

France is stepping up again on an issue that is unlikely to be accepted by the United States or Britain. French President Nicolas Sarkozy is pressing for leaders at the upcoming G20 summit to consider a worldwide tax on every financial transaction, the proceeds from which would be used to fund global public goods.
While the idea is nice in theory, it’s highly unlikely that the United States would be willing to follow such a plan. Not only is it ideologically unsettling for the majority of Americans (we don’t like our markets to be regulated too closely by our own government, nevermind some shadowy “global” leadership), but we are also the ones who would be taking the greatest hit from such a tax. As the country with the largest financial centers in the world, the United States would be feeling the brunt of these taxes more than any other. And if there’s one thing Americans don’t like, it’s raising taxes.
Thus there’s no small irony in the fact that the so-called “Tobin tax” was originally introduced by an American economist. In the 1970s, James Tobin came up with the idea of a universal financial tax as a way to cut excessively speculative trades and encourage long-term decision-making. The idea is that people will spend more time deciding whether or not a risky financial investment is worth it if they know that they’ll have to foot the bill through a strictly regulated taxation system.
Tobin suggested that the revenues generated by such a tax could be used to aid developing countries. But his idea proved unfavorable in the eyes of the majority, so the International Monetary Fund and Bretton Woods system won out — leaving a legacy of massive debt and devaluation for developing countries around the world.
But developing countries aren’t really in the game plan for today’s Tobin tax. Rather, Sarkozy suggests that leaders could use revenues to fund some of the bailouts in the financial industry, or the multibillion-dollar stimulus packages being used to jumpstart economies around the world. This could provide a buffer against any economic slowdowns in the future. Perhaps leading countries in the global economy will be more willing to consider the Tobin tax this time around, since the global tax could benefit them directly — but then again, the United States and Britain won’t buy it, so other countries’ opinions really aren’t that important.
Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair put it well when he said, “If one or two countries refuse to adopt a common levy or action or taxation, then it makes it very difficult to implement.” If one country is trying to supervise cash flows while another allows these flows to continue to move unregulated, of course most people will try to avoid paying up by making their transactions happen overseas. And if the biggest financial centers in the world — the United States and Great Britain — refuse to regulate, then chances are no one else will want to pay, either.
It’s a shame, really, because in theory the Tobin tax could solve many issues. There would be a general framework and a workable set of rules for the flow of money on a global scale; there would be a massive sum of money on hand for any country to use if the markets were to sour again in the future; and bankers would finally have to be held accountable for every single transaction they make — not just when the Security and Exchange Commission decides it’s time for a checkup. But thus far, France hasn’t even gotten its closest trading partners, the European Union and Germany, to agree to the Tobin tax. Sarkozy has succeeded in making headlines, but there’s no reason to believe his ideas will ever move beyond paper.
Another consideration is the cost of such a plan. How high would these taxes need to be in order to fund all of the new bureaucracy, nevermind also attempting to pay off worldwide bailouts? To what new lengths of corruption would financiers go in order to avoid paying these taxes? These and other important questions will surely be raised by a host of skeptics before any reforms might take place.
President Barack Obama berated financiers last week for not learning the lesson of the Lehman Brothers. The strict warning was met with approval from most constituencies, for we all know something must be changed. But, as in the case of health care reform, there’s a general understanding that any truly revolutionary ideas are unacceptable. There are many things we don’t like about our system here in the United States, but that doesn’t mean we’re willing to change it. And while the financial system does need regulation, there’s no way we’re going to let someone else do it for us.

This opinion piece is just slight rewording and reorganizing of article published on BBC News last thursday. And it was Gordon Brown, not Tony Blair who said, “If one or two countries refuse to adopt a common levy or action or taxation, then it makes it very difficult to implement” and also the “If one country is trying to supervise cash flows while another allows these flows to continue to move unregulated, of course most people will try to avoid paying up by making their transactions happen overseas,” in slighty different wording, which you wrote it as your own opinion. Shame on you for copying article written by someone else!

With textbook prices soaring and digital filesharing becoming increasingly easy, some students are baffled as to why they are being asked to buy their professors’ own published works.
At a large university like USC, a substantial number of faculty members publish scholarly works and textbooks — and some of those professors require students to purchase their own textbooks for class.
This practice, however, has raised questions from students.
Aly Laux, a junior majoring in accounting and business administration, said her business administration class with Professor Merle Hopkins is easier because Hopkins wrote the textbook.
“It was easier to understand,” Laux said. “It’s nice to have the study guide in his own words describing the terms; I think he made it a really good introduction to a new topic.”
Hopkins, a professor of clinical accounting, said until about 10 years ago he produced a study guide for his business administration class as a supplement to the required textbook. He said he eventually found the study guide more beneficial than the text he had been using.
“What I became aware of was that the students were not buying the text — and if [they were] buying it, not using it,” Hopkins said. “Our old text was expensive … Me and my colleague agreed that we could
effectively teach the course with the guide.”
Hopkins declined to comment on the royalties he earns from his study guide.
Stephen Krach, a junior majoring in mechanical engineering, said he feels that having his book written by his fluid dynamics professor, Dr. David Wilcox, is beneficial for his class.
“My lecture notes match up perfectly with the book. I feel like it’s easier to learn it. It’s easy to have my notes and my textbook match as opposed to having a book that doesn’t match,” Krach said.
While some students find the books make it easier to understand the material, others said they don’t see the value in purchasing a hardcover version of the information they could likely derive from lecture notes.
“In some ways it supports their expertise,” Laux said. “It can also be a kind of fuzzy situation. You are already paying for their thoughts with tuition, so why do you also need the book, that’s why I take notes.”
Raymond McDermott, manager of course materials for the USC Pertusati Bookstore, said such textbooks can be an added advantage for students because they know they will be using them through the course of the semester.
“In many ways, it’s beneficial,” McDermott said. “And you’re getting your money’s worth. The book was designed around that class.”
Beyond cost, some students also said they felt professors who used their own books in classes could be forcing a single point of view on students.
“I took a Thematic Option class where one of the professors required us to read one of his books,” said Gordon Roland, a junior majoring in business administration.
“I felt that in especially class discussion I shouldn’t say anything that was against what was in the book — it seems like
whenever anyone said anything against the book that the professor had some way to refute it,” Roland said.
Using a professor’s book can also limit students to the different resources they have to access the information, Laux said.
“Sometimes I think it’s beneficial to have an outside source,” she said. “If I didn’t understand something then I wouldn’t have an
outside source to look at. When a teacher writes a book, it will be explained in the same way it already was.”
There are two major problems with professors requiring that their own text books be used in class.
First, it is tantamount to profiteering which no reasonable professor should be able to accept within their professional ethics.
Second, and this is perhaps more dangerous but fortunately less frequent, these books are not necessarily subject to peer review. I am thinking primarily of the example from Prof. Wilcox who is particularly adamant about the validity of his text against other peer reviewed texts. While it is unlikely that the university would allow a textbook that professed outright lies as truth, there are a good many inaccuracies and omissions that could easily prove to be more damaging than an outright fabrication.
The number of students who simply ignore the source of their lecturers’ information in favor of having a textbook that matches up exactly with their lectures is deeply concerning.
