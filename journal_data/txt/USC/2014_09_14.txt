Derek Adam Seehausen, a 26-year-old fourth-year medical student at USC who has been missing since Aug. 5, has allegedly been seen twice since his disappearance.
A tip to the Los Angeles Police Deparment on Sept. 10 described a man matching Seehausen’s description shuffling on Pacific Coast Highway near Solana Beach, California. Seehausen has plantar fasciitis, a painful disorder affecting the heel and underside of the foot, which private investigator Thomas Martin, who was hired by Seehausen’s family, attributes the man’s shuffling gait.
The L.A. County Sherriff’s Department also reportedly sighted Seehausen on Sept. 5 while searching Metro bus footage for a sexual assailant. They reported a sighting of a man with similar characteristics to Seehausen.
At a press conference on Sept. 12 at USC’s Health Sciences Campus, Jean Gadra, Seehausen’s mother, made her first public appearance since her son’s disappearance. Gadra said Seehausen posted a video of himself scuba diving through kelp on Facebook a week before he went missing. Her son also called her around the same time to tell her the dates of Keck School of Medicine’s spring graduation and talk about Christmas plans.
“This is an unimaginable nightmare for our family. We don’t understand it. … If you took a thousand people, Derek would be the last person that you would think would do this,” Gadra said.
After Seehausen had not attended class in two days, fellow students started to suspect that something was wrong. With Martin’s help, Seehausen’s family has photos of possible sightings and believes that he is still alive. Martin said that he hasn’t talked to any law enforcement officers who think that Seehausen is deceased.
At 10:34 p.m. on Aug. 5, Seehausen was caught on tape at a Vons ATM withdrawing $200. Later that night at 11:54 p.m., Seehausen made a $2,999 payment to a friend via his iPhone. He was last seen at 12:02 a.m. Aug. 6 on foot northbound on Alvarado Street.
Martin said that no foul play is suspected. He does not believe there is any connection between the payment and Seehausen’s disappearance.
A family member told NBC San Diego that Seehausen has ties in San Diego County, where Solana Beach is located, and is a frequent visitor to the area. Seehausen supposedly was planning to visit his best friend in San Diego during the time of his disappearance. He has also been known to surf at nearby Mission Beach.
Shuhan He, a close friend and USC student who spoke at the press conference, described Seehausen as intelligent, athletic and resourceful. He said Seehausen was top of his class and very motivated, and said he said he spoke to Seehausen three days before his disappearance about plans for the weekend.
Seehausen’s family and friends have set up a website, helpfindderek.com, hoping to expand their search by reaching out to the public for help.
Seehausen is about 6 feet tall and 180 pounds with brown hair and hazel eyes. According to NBC Los Angeles, he was last seen wearing a black sweater, maroon T-shirt, plaid shorts and colorful shoes. He has a distinct 5 cm flesh-colored scar on his right arm. Those with any information are asked to contact the LAPD Adult Missing Persons Unit at 213-996-1800.

Ambassador Ido Aharoni, Consul General of Israel in New York, spoke at the Chabad House on Sept. 12, where members of the Jewish community gathered for the bi-annual Jewnity Shabbat dinner.
United · Rabbi Dov Wagner of Chabad @ USC enjoys hosting the Jewnity event at the Chabad house becaues it creates a family-friendly environment. – Jessica Magana | Daily Trojan
 
The dinner, hosted by the Rohr Chabad Jewish Student Center, featured Aharoni and Russell F. Robinson, the CEO of the Jewish National Fund, who spoke to students.
“I’m here as an official representative of the state of Israel to say thank you to the Jewish National Fund for all the great work that they’ve done, and bring the message from Israel to the students,” Aharoni said.
Aharoni cultivated the concept of “nation branding” and founded the organization “Brand Israel,” a coalition of seven marketing and communication executives. The organizations aims to redirect the existing conversation about Israel.
“The conversation about Israel usually is about Israel’s problems,” he said.
Nation branding is derived from psychology, sociology and anthropology whereas classic diplomacy stemmed from law, history and advocacy, according to Ahraoni.
“Branding is all about emotions and relationships, about the tie that exists between a person and a place,” he said.
Students were in agreement with Ahraoni’s speech when he talked about the status of Israel.
“I think it’s very important for people to understand what’s going on in the world,” said Shaun Edalati, a sophomore majoring in international relations (global business). “Some people [including Jews] are uneducated.”
The event was sponsored in part by the Jewish National Fund, a nonprofit organization that purchases and develops land for Jewish settlement through reforestation and other efforts. Their visit to USC is part of a tradition that accompanies the Jewish National Fund’s annual conference, which is held in Beverly Hills this year.
“Every year it’s a different city,” Robinson said. “We’ve always made a decision that we’re going to hold a Shabbat dinner with the Jewish students from the nearest college or university,”
Shabbat dinners welcome the Sabbath day in the Jewish faith. The Jewnity Shabbat dinner is an event where all Jewish organizations, including Hillel and Chabad, congregate once per semester.
The tradition began eight years ago when student leaders at Chabad @ USC approached the staff at USC Hillel to create the event, according to Rabbi Dov Wagner of Chabad @ USC.
“I think they were excited to start this program with us,” he said, “It remains very popular among the students that are involved in each organization,”
Each semester, the location of Jewnity alternates between these two organizations to bring the entire community closer despite differing worship styles.
“At the Chabad house, I live here with my family,” Wagner said. “When people join us at Shabbat dinner, they’re going [to see] me, my wife and kids who live here on campus, it’s a little bit more of that home emphasis.”
Edalati agreed that the dinner was a reminder of home.
“It’s so much food,” he said. “It’s exactly what my mom would cook on a Shabbat night.”
A traditional service at Chabad requires that men and women sit separately so attendees can be in a group of their own gender and not be distracted by members of the opposite sex, according to Emily Hyatt, a rabbinic intern for USC Hillel.
Despite differences among Jewish organizations, the purpose of Jewnity is to remind students that Jewish groups are different parts of a single community. The evening started with traditional songs and prayers. Afterwards, the Chabad house hosted a multicourse feast.
Several student groups co-sponsored the event, including Trojans for Israel, USC Sigma Delta Tau and Alpha Epsilon Pi Fraternity.
Yonatan Hirshberg, a freshman majoring in screenwriting said he did not know what to expect out of the evening, but was glad he attended.
“I’ve met a lot of my friends and I saw my RA here,” he said, “I really liked the speakers.”
Upcoming events in the Jewish community include the Chabad 500 and spring Jewnity, which will be hosted at Hillel. Both Rabbis Wagner and Hyatt have a great passion for working with the students at USC.
“We can have a lot of different mindsets, different perspectives, different ways in which we worship, in which we express our Jewish identity,” Wagner said. “But at [the] core we’re one community.”

USC’s entrepreneurial umbrella organization, SPARK SC, hosted their 1000 Pitches kickoff event last Friday evening.
Innovators welcome · Stephen Chen, a junior majoring in computer science, greets students at last Friday’s inaugural 1000 Pitches competition held inside Annenberg’s Innovation Lab. – Zhiliang Zhao | Daily Trojan
An annual competition that began at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, 1000 Pitches encourages students from all academic disciplines to submit their ideas, or “pitches,” in any of 10 categories including mobile apps, consumer products and small businesses, environment, health, university improvements, education, tech and hardware, web and software, sponsor pitches and research. The competition awards $1,000 to the winner in each of the 10 categories.
A contestant pitches an idea by recording a video ranging from thirty seconds to three minutes in length that outlines his or her idea. Each contestant can pitch up to three ideas. Students can either submit their videos online or record at SPARK SC “pitch booths” — camera stations  to be set up on Trousdale Parkway on Tuesdays and Thursdays that allow students to pitch on the spot. The judging panel will consist of L.A. industry leaders who also sponsor the event.
In order to get sponsors for the new competition, SPARK SC director of events Calvin LeGassick had to do a lot of pitching of his own. He worked with Adena Bauer, director of communications for SPARK SC, to set up the event. Planning started in early spring and lasted throughout the summer.
“We felt that the entrepreneurial activities were really lacking and limited at USC,” Bauer said. “We’re trying to get students from all academic interests to put forth their ideas. We’re trying to foster an environment where students are working together to come up with innovative ideas and projects.”
Held in Annenberg’s Innovation Lab, the kickoff event drew nearly two hundred attendees, including students, faculty and sponsors. Representatives from two major sponsors, Cornerstone OnDemand and The Michelson 20 Million Minds Foundation, spoke at the event about their unique experiences with entrepreneurship as well as their optimism regarding 1000 Pitches’ potential.
Dean Florez, president and CEO of 20 Million Minds, emphasized the need for innovative ideas from young minds.
“You know how many millennials are in the United States, right?” he asked. “80 million — 80 million millennials [who have] a better understanding of what the problems are than a lot of guys my age. What’s really interesting about your generation is the fact that you are creating. You’re innovators. In fact, if you’re thinking about Silicon Valley, they have one really big, big problem. And that is [that] most of them are my age. And most of them look to you.”
The 20 Million Minds Foundation is a privately funded organization with the goal of developing innovative solutions to improve access, affordability and success for students in higher education. Founded by Dr. Gary K. Michelson — whose $50 million donation funded the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience in early 2014 — 20 Million Minds supports both nonprofit and for-profit entities as well as policy leaders that advance educational technology.
Florez also said that entrepreneurship can benefit from knowledge of the social sciences.
“It’s not just about business,” he said. “It’s not just about the next start-up in Silicon Valley that takes off. We need your ideas in education. We need ideas in healthcare. We scour around the world for the best. We want solutions. We expect a solution from you. There’s so many problems in higher ed.”
Vice President of Business Affairs and General Counsel for Cornerstone OnDemand Adam Weiss also spoke about his experiences in entrepreneurship. Cornerstone OnDemand is a company that offers talent management software to empower members of an organization to maximize skill sets, potential to learn and efficacy to collaborate.
“To be an entrepreneur does not necessarily mean you’re starting a company,” Weiss said. “It doesn’t mean you’re recreating the wheel. In fact, at least in my mind, the most successful and interesting innovations are what I call incremental innovations.”
He listed ride-sharing company Uber as an example.
“Uber uses cars — those existed before,” he said. “Uber uses drivers — those existed before. But incrementally, Uber created almost a whole new area for transportation. At the end of the day, it’s [a] question of responding to the wants that people ask versus solving for needs. It’s sensing what the underlying needs are in society and figuring the solution.”
Last year, Cornerstone launched the Cornerstone Innovation Fund as an effort to support promising start-ups that support the company’s vision. Depending the caliber of the pitches, the ideas that come out of 1000 Pitches might warrant the attention of the Cornerstone Innovation Fund.
“We’re going to have an incubator in our office where we’re fostering start-ups,” said Josh LeGassick, a solutions architect at Cornerstone and Calvin LeGassick’s father. “I think that we are going to do more as result of the pitches. Depending on how the results end up, we may want to promote some ideas.”
After the speeches, four students pitched their individual ideas to the audience as an icebreaker. The pitches included an online internship matching tool, healthy food trucks, an online thrift shopping experience and an alarm that incorporates social media. Following the opening pitches, a camera station was set up to encourage audience members to pitch their ideas immediately if they already had some in their minds.
Binh Pham, an undeclared sophomore who attended the kickoff event, said the competition addressed the lack of entrepreneurial opportunities at USC.
“I’m glad I found out about this event when I was at the involvement fair,” he said. “The pitches that kicked off the competition were really good. The contest in general is a great addition because I did feel that USC was missing an entrepreneurial aspect. This event has inspired me so that I might even submit a pitch based on some ideas I have.”

Saturday’s loss to Boston College marked a big bump in the road for the Trojans’ national championship hopes. Daily Trojan columnists Luke Holthouse and Jake Davidson join Daily Trojan sports editors Aubrey Kragen and Will Hanley to discuss the implications of the Trojans’ unexpected defeat at the hands of the Eagles.
Sark raving mad · USC fans voiced their displeasure with head coach Steve Sarkisian’s playcalling, but Daily Trojan columnist Luke Holthouse disagrees: Sarkisian called 46 passing plays to 29 rushing plays. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
 
What went wrong for the Trojans in Boston?
WH: It’s really easy to look at this loss and say it was just meant to happen. USC was playing 3,000 miles from home, 12 hours after its normal practice time on a slippery artificial surface. BC fans were slow to arrive but eventually packed the stadium, and the building was about as loud as it could get. The school honored two heroes —  Welles Crowther, “the man in the red bandana,” and Pete Frates, a former Eagles’ baseball player fighting ALS. It did make for quite the upset narrative that I’m sure BC fans will remember for decades to come. But there are realities here. USC could not move the ball on the ground. At all. Ever. Not once. This is a team that kept itself alive last week against the vaunted Stanford defense with a strong running game.
The Trojan defense looked mentally and physically slow, and eventually tired by the end of the contest. Cody Kessler, whose numbers looked great, had his moments, but for the most part was slow on his reads and checked down far too often. Even on special teams, USC looked utterly confounded by two consecutive squib kickoffs that pinned the team inside its own 20. To take nothing away from BC, it was a disastrous performance from the Trojans.
 
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian himself took the blame for the loss in a postgame press conference. How much of this game was affected by Sarkisian’s playcalling?
LH: I would not place that much blame on the play calling of Steve Sarkisian. Plenty on Twitter were asking for more pass plays given the feeble ground attack, but Sarkisian did call for 46 pass plays and only 29 rush attempts. Sarkisian needed to try to establish the running game to keep BC’s defense honest on potential deep balls. Not only that, but even when Sarkisian called for passes on big third downs, so many of them ended in sacks. Of the five sacks USC surrendered, all five came on third down, and four came in the second half. Add on the 37 points surrendered on defense, and I don’t think there’s that much else Sarkisian could have done.
 
JD: Sarkisian blew the game. Kessler could have torched that defense and vaulted himself into the Heisman conversation with a ruthlessly efficient 42-for-50, 450 yard and 6 TD game. As it is he completed close to 75 percent of his passes for three TD’s and 300 yards playing with a proverbial hand tied behind his back for three and a half quarters.
The Trojans were absolutely torched on defense, surrendering the most rushing yards in a single game in more than 26 years. Where did the defense falter specifically for the Trojans?
AK: First, I must say that BC quarterback Tyler Murphy was on another level on Saturday. Some of the best defenses in the country might not have been able to stop him — he was that fast. I also think BC just drew up a great gameplan. They were consistently able to get outside on us, which sophomore safety Su’a Cravens chalked up to miscommunication on the defense. Again, I don’t quite understand how the team didn’t fix that issue at halftime, but what do I know about reading an offensive scheme on defense?
 
WH: I never expected this to be a low-scoring game. Most teams struggle with the read-option, especially when they face it for the first time. If someone had told me before the game that the Eagles’ would score between 20 and 30 points and that Murphy would pick up over 100 yards on the ground, I would’ve been disappointed, but not surprised.
The basic goal of a spread offense amounts to a two-step process: First, spread the defense out with screen passes and read-option/sweep runs, and secondly, exploit the holes in the middle of the newly stretched out defense with inside runs and deeper passes.
That’s how Oregon has pummeled USC — and most of the country — in the past few years. The funny thing about this game, however, was that BC never had to get past step one. Murphy and his backs ran horizontally to stretch out the Trojan defense, and then just ran right around that defense when it couldn’t contain anyone. It was just a game of “beat me to the edge” that Murphy won literally every time.
 
It might be a little too early to say, but what are your projections for this team moving forward?
AK: As we saw at Stanford, USC has the stuff to hang with some of the best teams in the country. But we also showed our weaknesses this weekend. We might have a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde team this year, showing up in big games and losing seemingly easy ones. I think how the squad comes out against Oregon State will tell us what kind of team this is going to be.
 
LH: I think the loss is more indicative of problems to come than significant in and of itself. It’s out of conference so USC could still finish the year undefeated and guarantee a spot in the Pac-12 championship game. If the Trojans could beat an unbeaten Oregon team in that game along with wins at Notre Dame and UCLA along the way, I would be shocked if the team didn’t make the four-team national championship playoff. But that scenario looks particularly unlikely after this week. No one besides Oregon has really impressed me in the conference so far, so I wouldn’t be surprised if USC still won the South division, but that’s totally up in the air. Even if USC got there, it looks like the Ducks would run all over the USC defense in a potential Pac-12 title game. The most interesting stat of the night I think is that USC won the turnover margin — the Trojan defense forced one interception but the Trojan offense had neither a fumble or a pick — and still lost. This wasn’t some fluke performance; USC straight up got outplayed by a team that I didn’t think belonged on the same field.

The USC men’s water polo team picked up right where it left off last weekend on Saturday with two big wins over unranked Chapman and Occidental. Neither the Panthers nor the Tigers were a match for the six-time defending champions.
Leading by example · Senior driver Kostas Genidounias had a relatively quiet weekend with four goals in the Trojans’ 24-0 vanquishing of Occidental College. Genidounias had 16 goals last weekend at the Triton Invitational. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
USC (8-0) started off with a 14-0 run against Chapman before rolling on to a 21-6 win. In their second game, USC shut out Occidental 24-0. After Saturday, the Trojans were allowing 4.0 goals per game for the season. Coach Jovan Vavic, who has led USC’s men’s and women’s water polo teams to a combined 13 national championships, not only had his players ready defensively but also had them playing with offensive efficiency. Neither Chapman nor Occidental had a save against the No. 3 team.
Coach Vavic was not surprised by these surges.
“We are playing some less experienced opponents, and we are playing better players at the beginning of the game more,” Vavic said.
One of the greatest strengths of this group of players is its ability to work as a team. Senior driver Kostas Genidounias was the undeniable Trojan star of the Triton Invitational last weekend with sixteen goals. Nonetheless, both of yesterday’s games featured different stars at the top of the scoring list. Freshman driver Matteo Morelli led scoring with five goals in the first game. Senior two-meter Max Hurst-Mendoza did not score at all against Chapman but led with a career-best five goals against Occidental. Although Genidounias is the No. 4 all-time scorer in USC history entering the 2014 season, Coach Vavic emphasizes his ability as a distributer.
“Having Kostas on our team helps everybody,” Vavic said. “He’s not just a great scorer. He’s also a great assist player. He’s like LeBron James. A player like that on your team makes everybody better.”
Thirteen total Trojans scored on the first day of this tournament.
Additionally, players with international experience are able to provide an important lift to the team as well. Coach Vavic believes that these players are very valuable.
“That has been the reason we have been successful for so many years, because these young players come in and are able to bring this experience from Europe or Australia,” Vavic said. “They also are very skilled. Sometimes, these guys play on more experienced international teams. They have more experience than 18-year-olds.”
Freshman goalie McQuin Baron, who had 12 saves against Chapman, freshman two-meter Lachlan Edwards, who had four combined goals on Saturday, and freshman utility man Mihajlo Milicevic, who had two goals against Chapman, all have experience playing outside the United States. This group combined with the young local experience of freshman utility Bryce Hoerman, who had a total of three goals on Saturday. Freshman driver Grant Stein and freshman utility man James Walters, who both had four goals on Saturday, only add depth to USC’s already-deep squad.
Though USC’s opponents this week are not as strong as they were in San Diego last week, the team is slowly improving.
“Some areas are definitely better,” Vavic said. “Other areas need some more work, but overall it’s been pretty good. They are still learning to play together.”
Play for the Trojans resumed yesterday with a win against Concordia, 20-6 and another win against No. 18 Air Force, 25-7. USC improved to 22-0 overall against the two opponents. The Trojans were led by a contingent of freshmen in their victory over Concordia, as freshman driver Grant Stein netted nine total goals (four against Concordia and another five against Air Force). Freshman driver Matteo Morelli also had a big effort for the No. 3-ranked Trojans, netting four goals against Air Force.
The Trojans will face Air Force again Saturday for the NorCal Tournament in Stockton, California.

Saturday night’s loss to Boston College was miserable. After three and a half quarters, it was just shocking. The last eight minutes, however, elevated it to another level of agony because the second half of the fourth quarter demonstrated why USC should have won the game.
USC could have given up 600 yards on the ground, and the Trojans still should have won. Fleet-footed Boston College quarterback Tyler Murphy could have elevated his game from Ell Roberson impersonator to the second coming of Vince Young and the Trojans still should have won. The USC team could have shanked even more punts and muffed even more squib kicks, and the Trojans still should have won.
The reason is simple: Boston College’s secondary couldn’t handle USC’s wide receivers if they knew the plays ahead of time. They are a hapless bunch to say the least. The Trojans should have hung 70 on them. Those last eight minutes proved as much, when Coach Steve Sarkisian was finally forced to abandon the run and commit to the short passing game.
The result? Two crisp, beautiful drives down the field that shredded the BC defense. Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler channeled his inner Drew Brees, marching the Trojans down the field with quick, accurate passes letting his arsenal of athletic receivers, tight ends and running backs work in space. The only thing that could have stopped USC on Saturday night was what ultimately did them in: Coach Steve Sarkisian’s stubborn insistence on running the football.
Kiffin bubble screen, meet Sarkisian run up the middle. In theory, I’m all for Sarkisian’s power running scheme. In a year or two, I have no doubt that his vision of an up-tempo power running attack will be a force to be reckoned with. It worked against Fresno State, and I’m sure it could conceivably work wonders in more games this year.
And yet, it had no hope of working against Boston College. That much was evident by halftime. Sophomore running back Justin Davis was a revelation last year before an ankle injury ended his year prematurely. He still hasn’t recaptured the burst that made him so dangerous last year. Even with a hobbled Davis, a worn-out Allen and an offensive line splitting like the Red Sea, Sark insisted on running up the middle. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result, and that was the USC offense in a nutshell.
Every glimmer of hope –— a brilliant pass call to senior tight end Randall Telfer, a quick throw to freshman receiver JuJu Smith as he muscled his way to a first down — was soon dashed as USC’s stable of running backs were engulfed by a sea of Boston College defenders play after play. If I squinted at precisely the right angle, I probably could have seen Washington State defenders on the TV, camped out and waiting on Marqise Lee as he caught a bubble screen for negative yards.
As this exercise in futility progressed, every USC couch coach in the country was saying the same thing: throw the ball. Lo and behold, with eight minutes left in the fourth quarter, Kessler’s leash was finally taken off. Who would have thought that the most sought-after skill position players in the country would make plays with the ball in their hands. That revelation is surely one only the brain surgeons at the Keck School of Medicine could have dreamed up.
USC punted the ball eight straight times. If they had run their offense the way they did on their last two possessions drives, it is not out of the realm of possibilities to think they would have scored on anywhere from three to six of those drives.
Sure, the argument could be made that USC tried to pass in the first three quarters and Kessler often missed high in the first half and got sacked on four straight third downs in the third quarter. Those first half calls, however, are not where Kessler excels, and even Peyton Manning struggles when his head is repeatedly bashed into the turf.
Quick methodical throws to the plethora of athletes at Sark’s disposal is not a novel concept. It’s the same thing that works at the park. Superior talent generally triumphs in one-on-one matchups. Sometimes, the easy thing works, especially against an inferior defensive squad like the Boston College Golden Eagles.
Sarkisian is a brilliant offensive mind and a tremendous recruiter, but so was Lane Kiffin. Kiffin’s downfall was a healthy dose of arrogance accompanied by a refusal to alter his game plan and adapt. So far, Sark has shown flexibility in every facet of coaching besides actual in-game adjustments. I hope this disturbing loss was a wakeup call. USC can still be a team to be reckoned with. They have the most explosive receivers in the country; all it takes is getting them the ball.
There are plenty of other issues with the team, namely a defensive scheme that gets gassed and then gashed with a thin, beleaguered front seven. That’s not Sark or Justin Wilcox’s fault, that’s the NCAA for you. Even if the defense resembled a Monte Kiffin special on Saturday, USC should have won in a shootout. They had the ability to score at will, if Sark had just gotten out of his own way.
To his credit, he took full responsibility after the game. I know Sark is going to build an unbelievable dynasty at USC in the future. In the here and now, however, great coaches make adjustments to fit their current team. Plain and simple. Without Tre Madden, this isn’t a power running squad. It’s an explosive offensive, brimming with talent at the wide receiver and tight end positions. The minute USC starts to realize that identity is the minute games like the one played Saturday become a relic of a woebegone transition era.

The ninth-ranked Trojan football team suffered its first loss of the season this Saturday, a 37-31 beatdown at the hands of unranked Boston College.
Craving some defense · Sophomore safety Su’a Cravens and the USC defense was completely overwhelmed by Boston College’s ground attack Saturday, as they gave up 452 yards rushing to the Eagles’ offense, including a 66-yard touchdown run to Boston College quarterback Tyler Murphy. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Redshirt junior quarterback Cody Kessler finished the game 31-for-41 for 317 yards and four touchdowns, but USC’s inability to run the ball or stop the Eagles’ own dynamic rushing attack left the Trojans looking for answers as the Eagles’ faithful flooded the field after the game.
BC (2-1, 0-1 ACC) put up an astounding 452 rush yards, while USC (2-1, 1-0 Pac-12) totaled just 20. The 452 rushing yards were the most the Trojans have given up since the 1977 Bluebonnet Bowl, when Texas A&M put up 486.
“[Boston College] controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, and the end result was we didn’t get it done,” USC head coach Steve Sarkisian said. “We need to improve.”
USC had been preparing for BC quarterback Tyler Murphy all week, but appeared completely caught off guard by his speed. The Trojans allowed him to rack up 202 total rush yards, including a 66-yard scamper with just over three minutes left in the game that sealed the upset for the Eagles.
“He just beat us with his skills,” sophomore safety Su’a Cravens said. “We were anticipating him to run the ball, we knew he liked to scramble. We just didn’t execute. Third downs came up and he was just running all over the field, so we’ve got to take the fall for that.”
Murphy started slowly, though, which allowed the Trojans to jump out to a 10-0 lead.
Midway through the first quarter, Kessler hit junior wide receiver George Farmer in the end zone for the Los Angeles native’s first career touchdown. A 52-yard field goal from senior kicker Andre Heidari later in the first quarter put the Trojans up 10-0.
BC cut into the Trojans’ lead with a four-yard touchdown run by Tyler Rouse, but a missed extra point by kicker Joey Launceford left Trojan fans feeling confident.
Kessler answered with a 51-yard screen to redshirt junior running back Javorius “Buck” Allen to extend the Trojans’ lead, but from then on out, it was all Eagles.
As the clock wound down in the first half, BC’s Sherman Alston ripped off a 54-yard touchdown run to put the Eagles up 20-17 at halftime.
Though the Trojans looked sluggish at times in the first half, fans were anticipating a spark once senior linebacker Hayes Pullard stepped back on the field for the third quarter. Pullard received a targeting penalty in the second half of the game at Stanford and was forced to sit out of the first half of Saturday night’s game.
But despite Pullard’s best efforts, the Eagles continued to manipulate the Trojans’ defense to open up the second half.
“[BC] just went out there and executed the plan,” Pullard said. “We couldn’t just beat them off of raw talent. We have to base our focus on preparation, being able to contain these high-profile quarterbacks. That’s what we’re going to be playing against in the Pac-12, so I would look at this as more of a gain than a loss.”
Though Pullard and the USC defense couldn’t stop the bleeding, the Trojans’ offense was nonexistent. The Eagles sacked Kessler on third down on each of USC’s three drives in the third quarter, forcing the Trojans to punt deep in their own territory every time.
The Trojans’ offensive line finally showed its inexperience, as Kessler was sacked a total of five times in the game.
“[BC’s defense] did a good job getting to me,” Kessler said. “We should have made some better calls on my part and my O-line’s part, it was a combination of both.”
When the Trojans got desperate late in the fourth quarter, Sarkisian called for Kessler to throw the ball more often, and he provided a spark the team had been missing all game. Kessler went 17-for-20 in the fourth, including a touchdown toss to sophomore wide receiver Darreus Rogers with 1:18 left to cut BC’s lead to 37-31.
Murphy, on the other hand, went 0-for-2 in the fourth quarter and just 5-for-13 on the game.
The bye week comes at a good time for the Trojans, who were outgained 506 to 337 in total yards. USC will have a week off before returning home to host Oregon State, and the squad is ready to get back to the drawing board.
“The loss was hard,” Sarkisian said. “We’ve got a very disappointed locker room, but I really believe we’ll bounce back. We’ll do it in great fashion.”

Last week Sons of Anarchy and Boardwalk Empire premiered the first episodes of their final seasons. Because television is an extremely competitive business, shows rarely get to finish their stories on their own terms like this. Ratings dip or fail to get off the ground in the first place, actors decide they want to leave or studios decide they want something fresher. Thanks to all this, storylines are cut short all the time. The cream of the television show crop, however, gets to finish what it started. That, of course, opens up an entirely different set of problems for shows like Sons of Anarchy and Boardwalk Empire. Basically, writing a good ending is really, really hard.
After a show has been on the air for several seasons, an ending has to grapple with countless loose ends and somehow tie them up into a satisfying bow. The most famous recent example was the final season of Breaking Bad which aired last year. The loose ends were plentiful, and the pressure was on for a satisfying ending, as the show had set its own bar very high. What was released was a season of television unlike any other. The final eight episodes saw the plot reach a frenetic pace and sustained tension unlike anything that has ever been on TV, making each episode a big event. On social media, you could feel the excitement over each new episode, and the conversation in the week between the episodes was peppered with enthusiasm about the latest episode and speculation over what would happen next. It was one payoff after another, scenes that viewers had been trying to imagine for years finally appearing and then immediately providing new material to speculate about. The finale came and went and tied up every loose end while offering a satisfying conclusion.
That final season is a dream scenario for any TV show. Odds are that neither Boardwalk Empire nor Sons of Anarchy will reach such dizzying heights, as both shows, Boardwalk Empire especially, seem almost to be limping toward the finish line where Breaking Bad was coming to a crescendo. This is not too shameful, as it is hard to compete against one of the best shows of all time, but even though a last season with the electricity of Breaking Bad’s is almost certainly out of reach, the final season can be a big boost to a show on it’s last legs as it amps up its intensity. Sons of Anarchy seems like a prime candidate for this sort of late boost since its already high level of intensity could be turned up a few extra notches as the story comes to a close.
Where there is potential for a boost, however, there are many more potential tripping points where the perception of a show can be drastically altered by its final season or series finale. The final season of Lost was so notorious as a maelstrom of crazy plot points and loose ends that it tarnished the public view of the series overall. The Sopranos, despite its many years as another one of the greatest shows ever, is perhaps most well known in today’s pop culture landscape for its controversial cut to black in the series finale. David Chase, the showrunner for The Sopranos, recently made headlines by talking about that ending seven years after it originally aired. These are two classic shows whose perceptions in the public eye are disproportionately defined by their final offerings. Depending on your adherence to the maxim that any publicity is good publicity in show business, this might be something worth pursuing for a show like Boardwalk Empire that is dragging itself toward the finish line.
But perhaps before its writers decide to end the show by revealing that it was all a dream in Bob Newhart’s head in order to generate extra buzz, they might stop to think about how TV shows are watched now. Breaking Bad’s final season felt so special in part because it was a rare occasion when we as an audience were watching the same thing at the same time as everyone else anymore. With streaming and DVDs and even shows being released full seasons at a time, there is less emphasis on maintaining buzz between episodes and presumably more and more viewers hitting “watch next episode” whenever they’re watching a show as opposed to watching it live and waiting a whole week for the next morsel. Streaming has changed the way shows structure themselves, and it also has given new life to old shows that had fallen into obscurity. With a show’s entire run available to be watched at one time, not having a reputation for being a letdown at the end is a big boost against shows that have made finale noise for the wrong reasons.
So perhaps the best bet for a show that can’t go out with a bang like the Breaking Bads of the world is to instead aim for something satisfying after watching seven episodes in a row in bed.

The guitar is not extinct — not yet anyway. In an age where synth, auto-tune and heavy bass have infiltrated and dominated the music industry, there still exist musicians like Blake Mills, whose emotive sound relies on a delicate balance of strings.

Mills has been floating around  the music industry in the company of some of its biggest names, but has kept mostly quiet for the past four years. Now, Mills has reemerged with his second album, Heigh Ho, due out Sept. 16. It features an impressive number of guest musicians— many of whom Mills listened to while he was growing up— while still maintaining his individuality.
Mills has spent much of last year performing with the stellar songstress Fiona Apple, who makes a guest appearances on a couple of his songs and whom he credits with shaping many of his goals for the record.
“The goal going in wasn’t specifically directly musical, but rather one that was centered on making sense of something that’s really honest and not trying to adhere to a genre,” Mills said.
That’s something Mills witnessed firsthand playing with Apple. Her music has a lot of heart, but also a natural diversity and universality.
Mills has worked with a breadth of artists in addition to Apple, from Conor Oberst and Sky Ferreira to Beck, Lucinda Williams, Andrew Bird and Neil Diamond. While his impressive rolodex demonstrates both his skill and his style, many of Mills’ influences on the record were nonmusical.
Mills specifically cites a photography book that features images of deteriorating homes, ballet schools, ballrooms and open spaces shot in Havana, Cuba. He had just visited the country for a work trip, and the experience had a profound effect on him both personally and inspirationally.
“When people are doing scores for film, they’re influenced by pictures and the telling of the story,” Mills said. “There’s something cinematic about that music, and I think there are moments on the record that feel, at least to me, somewhat cinematic.”
Mills is equally inspired by melody, describing the catharsis he feels when he sits down and can play something new without knowing what it is — sound that happens spontaneously without meaning until it is given content or context. But that’s where he also faces difficulty.
Mills described his writing process as laborious and slow, one in which he grapples with finding the right word as he is critical of using any word that he doesn’t truly mean.
“The writing side is almost more like a hobby that I’m fascinated by, but ultimately frustrated with as well,” Mills said.
In the four years since he released his first record, Break Mirrors, Mills has accumulated an arsenal of emotions and feelings — both autobiographical and not — that informed much of his writing. Though Mills was careful to produce a record that he felt was honest, he feared falling into the singer/songwriter trap, in which the whole album becomes a long foray into his life story and his deepest, darkest secrets. It’s a fragile distinction and one that required much examination and introspection, he said.
“I try to write a song structure that isn’t around the weight of each word, but rather the celebration of the fact that there are words being sung,” Mills said. “But it’s hard to do that. When I write, I feel like I’m wandering through a neighborhood that I didn’t grow up in, that I don’t belong in.”
The result is subtle, nuanced emotion. Mills’ songs offer a glimmer of something significant, something to which the listener is not granted full access.
But Mills sheds light on many of the album’s themes with its title. Heigh Ho most typically evokes the jovial working song sung by the septet of dwarves in Disney’s Snow White, but Mills discovered that the phrase’s meaning originated as an exclamation of weariness or boredom of something that can’t be changed, a sentiment that strongly resonated with him.
“It’s exactly the process of making a record and releasing it on a commercial label and all of the uncreative and scary ways that art is digested after you make it,” Mills said. “To me, it totally sums up my feelings about projecting this thing to the world.”
Mills describes the release of his first record as letting a mouse out of a trap, simultaneously setting something free and relinquishing control. With Heigh Ho, Mills was introduced to the interworking of a PR team and a record label.
“I’m trying to keep as much of me in all those areas behind the creative part of it, but it’s a struggle because there are so many hang-ups and traps that can distract you from the creative side,” Mills said. “I’m just kind of learning of it right now and I’m honestly a little scarred by it.”
Mills will perform the second show of his headlining tour at the El Rey this Thursday at 9 p.m.

It takes only a few seconds for anyone to notice that USC is a very busy place. To newly admitted freshmen, the hustle and bustle of Trousdale Parkway at 10 a.m. is frightening and chaotic at the very least. In an urban campus teeming with movement, activity and distracted students, efficient transportation is unfortunately lacking. That’s where GenZe, a startup conceived in Silicon Valley, comes in. The company seeks to remedy ineffective transport issues with its line of effective and eco-friendly electric scooters.
The concept behind GenZe was developed when the company toured university campuses across the country in an effort to examine and analyze the daily routine of college students. What they found was that students weren’t using transport for any single purpose, instead using them for a variety of things. Furthermore, many were unsatisfied with the existing modes of transport and desired more from their vehicles.
“Students would have to wait for a campus bus in the snow, rain or hot sun. If they were taking a bicycle, there wouldn’t be enough space for their laptop, backpack or groceries,” said Yesim Erez, head of marketing and development for GenZe. “Furthermore, universities like USC are making it increasingly difficult for students to own cars because it’s very expensive to park, gas prices are high and students can’t always afford to pay for repairs.”
With such problems in mind, GenZe has created two products that combine practical functionality with striking aesthetics and innovation. The GenZe 2.0 is an electric scooter that provides substantial storage capacity and creates a hassle-free transport experience. Powered by a rechargeable battery module, the vehicle is complete with an electronics charging port and a 7-inch touch-screen monitor that syncs with smartphone applications and indicates important vehicular diagnostics such as speed and charge state.
Its counterpart is the GenZe e-Bike, a modern twist on the traditional bicycle. Its distinct feature is its throttle, which can propel the bike without any human exertion. Also powered by a lightweight battery pack, the e-Bike is extremely versatile, coming in the form of both sports and recreational models.
For any company centered on a product, one of the most important elements of its success is the nature of consumers’ response. Naturally for GenZe, the feedback has been tremendous. Many students have already purchased the vehicles online, and the company is preparing to exhibit its products on various university campuses on the West Coast, including USC, UC Davis and UCLA.
GenZe’s successful and innovative products cannot be viewed in isolation, however, as the people and work behind the company also distinguishes GenZe from similar businesses. Genze has an immense talent pool — many of its engineers have previously worked at Tesla Motors and Mercedes-Benz. Furthermore, the GenZe team is diverse, as all designers have had extensive experience producing consumer products. According to the company, even in vehicle production, understanding consumers and their nuanced tastes is essential to success.
“We carefully studied what students define as cool, and we came to learn that they have an affinity for minimalism,” Erez said. “Look at our scooter, for example. Many people like scooters but don’t think they look cool. Thus, we made the seat so that you can sit on it or put it on a slant and lean on it like a barstool.”
Despite its current success among university students, GenZe is looking to continuously improve its products and business model. The company currently delivers products to California, Oregon and Michigan, a limitation that it hopes to soon overcome. In the next year, GenZe plans to expand across the country. By doing this, the company can sell their products directly to students and be conveniently located to provide more services to them. Furthermore, GenZe is also looking to expand its portfolio of electric vehicles in order to better serve the transportation needs of students and urban commuters.
GenZe’s vision keeps its engine going. The company hopes that their products will allow students to utilize its own skills and talents to create the next generation of ingenious products that create a positive difference in someone else’s world. “Always start with the end in mind and always try to think of a solution that no one else is thinking of,” Erez said. “You always want to create a unique product that has a value-added difference.
The GenZe does what a bicycle, skateboard and even a car cannot. It fills a void and a need that no other product can in the same way.” For students curious about GenZe’s products, the company will be exhibiting the GenZe 2.0 and the e-Bikes outside the Lyon Center on Sept. 16 and 17.

I’ll be the first to admit that I don’t understand football, which seems blasphemous at a place like USC. I do, however, enjoy the feeling of unity between everyone while watching a game and shouting expletives at the other team. When we win, strangers jump up and down and give each other hugs, as if instead of fans we’re all comrades during a war. Yet, everything I know about football I learned from Eric Taylor’s inspirational speeches on Friday Night Lights.
What I do understand, however, is that the Ray Rice scandal has revealed the behind-the-scenes reality in the sport and the sad treatment of domestic abuse. I haven’t watched the series of graphic videos because I think that would just give power to Rice’s actions, but according to Time, the first entails Rice dragging then-fiancée, now wife, Janay Palmer out of a casino elevator after apparently knocking her out. This was in February 2014. They got married shortly after the incident. On Sept. 8, new footage, leaked by TMZ, surfaced that showed Rice brutally hitting Palmer back in February. The NFL, according to the Associated Press, had reportedly received a copy of the violent video early in April, but only suspended Rice for two days. Only recently, after the TMZ leak, was the NFL pressured to suspend Rice indefinitely.
I used to believe in the separation of private and public spheres. To a certain degree, I still hold on to that opinion, but the recent Ray Rice videos that have taken the internet by storm have led me to believe a person’s professional and private life can’t be separated when there is a bigger issue to consider — in this case, domestic violence.
A running back for the Baltimore Ravens, Rice has had a decorated career. According to ESPN, Rice signed a five-year, $40 million contract with his team in 2012. The following year, the Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl. Though Rice’s last season hit a slight slump, he still carried his team in multiple games.
Needless to say, I understand that Rice played a major role in the Ravens’ glory. Football has also become an integral part of American culture. Yet, that still doesn’t mean that Rice’s deeds can be overlooked. A Sports Illustrated column, “Monday Morning Quarterback,” states that for football players, marijuana detection leads to an automatic four-game suspension. There are other strict disciplinary guidelines detailing how to treat players that misuse other substances. Meanwhile, Rice initially received only a two-game suspension early in the football season for beating Palmer to a point of unconsciousness. Legal charges against him were also dropped.
This light punishment trivializes domestic abuse even more, dismissing it as just an unfortunate incident. It’s akin to saying when strangers assault other strangers someone should go to jail, but when a significant other assault someone her or she supposedly loves, it’s OK to return home. The way NFL handled this issue is deplorable. The NFL dealt with misconduct by simply slapping Rice’s wrist and letting him go, responding only when there was a possibility of glaring public outrage. This reveals the organization’s values and what sports entertainment has become. It’s no longer just about the people gathering together to cheer on teams in good spirit. Rather, it’s about the image of the stars and how it affects ticket sales.
Of course, we can’t forget the victim of this domestic violence, Janay Palmer — now Janay Rice. She released a statement not long after Rice’s suspension saying she would stand by her husband through these times. She posted on her Instagram, “To take something away from the man I love that he has worked his ass [off] for all his life just to gain ratings is horrific.” This spurred a movement that trended on Twitter: #whyistayed. Victims of domestic violence elaborated on their turmoil, allowing people to see that the focus should not solely be on Rice but on how we can prevent this psychological abuse. There are factors that go beyond leaving or not leaving that complicate this abusive dynamic.
Moving forward, the NFL needs to team up with the #whyistayed movement in exploring the psychological damage involved with violent relationships. This way, the media will start putting more focus on the issue at hand. Football should promote respect and camaraderie off the field as well as on it.
Even I can understand that about football.

I am not sure how watching the elevator video givers power to Ray Rice’s actions…sort of sounds like the author is saying she does not want to confront reality when reality is unpleasant – sort of a childish reaction – close your eyes and the unpleasantness goes away…
That aside, I agree domestic abuse is terrible and we should deal with it head on as a society – to eradicate it – but we never will because as soon as we try to tackle some deep and unpleasant issue – we avoid getting to the bottom of the issue because it might mean dealing with reality on reality’s terms – and in this politically correct world, that is too much to ask for. Let’s face it – young men who grow up without a strong, moral, mal role model and who instead are exposed to chaotic home life where they witness domestic abuse – will gravitate towards this in their adult life. THAT is the issue we should be tackling – but we never will do this because as soon as someone tries to do that – for some reason they will be called out as a racist and instead we will continue to pay lip service to the tragedies of domestic violence without getting too real about mitigating it.

Apple revealed that the first pre-orders for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus set an all-time record, causing the U.S. website to crash almost immediately after the launch. The buying frenzy came after Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as well as the Apple Watch, on Tuesday, Sept. 9. Indeed, some eager Apple customers began lining up outside Apple’s flagship store on Sept. 3 in anticipation of the Sept. 19 release date.

These customers think they’re getting the best bargain, but little do they realize they are playing right into Apple’s calculated marketing strategies. The hype surrounding Apple products is all too telling of the addictive and manipulative nature of American consumer culture.
In fact, consumers have become their own advertisers. It’s easy to look at these consumers and write them off as diehard Apple fans just waiting for their favorite company’s next release. Yet websites crashing due to demand and professional line-sitters are just cases of consumers creating free publicity for a company. Sellers on eBay and other websites list pre-ordered phones at more than twice the standard price.One Craigslist advertisement, for example, lists a pre-order at $10,000 to “be one of the first & few people to own this model and before the rest of the world.” These buyers are paying for an excellent phone, but they’re also paying for the “I got it first” title to gain the prestige associated with the latest gadgets.
The idea that the most recent iWhatever is even associated with prestige, however, is troubling. Marketers perpetuate the image of electronics as the ultimate status symbol, and consumers buy into it. For example, every edition of Apple’s iPhone comes in a slightly different shape — from the iPhone 3G to the 4 to the 5 to the 5c and now the 6 and 6 Plus — each model retains its basic look with a barely noticeable upgrade that lets the world know if the item is or isn’t the latest model.
Technology models are also groomed for the short term. A 4-foot drop test on YouTube documented two trials for both the iPhone 5s and a Nokia 3310 phone, a basic phone first released in 2000. As expected, the iPhone 5s glass shattered completely, while the Nokia 3310 separated into two to four easily reassembled pieces. Though fragility might come with advanced features, making its electronics durable simply does not seem to be Apple’s priority. Upgrading parts are out of the question. Though it should be a rudimentary feature, Apple has not created a model with hardware that can be upgraded without buying a new unit. Anyone who runs iOS 7 on an iPhone 4 can attest that the hardware is simply not capable of adapting to the updated operating system. Repairs are known to exceed even the cost of a new model. Often, a broken phone is an excuse to buy a new one.
The discrepancy lies in the persistent shortening of the time electronics are considered up-to-date as technology supposedly advances every year. Electronics could be durable, long lasting and easy to repair, but they’re not because those models are not conducive to constant purchasing and upgrading. In contrast, changing a model every year creates a culture contingent upon the next model and the perpetual anticipation of it. Such a marketing strategy creates a long-term emotional investment, which subconsciously establishes brand loyalty. For the consumer, it’s dangerous; the desire for a new product becomes almost mindless, and the reason behind the desire is simply the desire itself.
As consumers, we should start holding companies responsible. Consumer pressure to get companies to create durable hardware can and must become the instrument for social and environmental change. It is only through deliberate attempts to disassociate technology with social status that the identity as buyers first, people second, will ever be dismantled. Right now, consumers really don’t need the latest iPod or iPhone or iPad — they need something iPermanent.
 
I can’t wait for December when the author of this article recycles the sanctimony and bemoans the commercialization of Christmas…really? Aren’t we so over these preachy articles about not buying into corporate hype? 
I love the closer “As consumers, we should start holding companies responsible. Consumer pressure to get companies to create durable hardware can and must become the instrument for social and environmental change…” Not sure what the author is advocating – sounds like he would like for Apple and other tech companies to slow down innovation so we can hang on to our devices longer…
Sonali, glad to see you’re not a lemming. Apple and Steve Jobs have created a cult following.
Just digressing a little, but it’s also a fraud when college textbooks come out with new editions, per professor requirement. This dynamic is the same as Apple’s iPhone craze. Same sh’t, under a new skin.
