Former USC water polo Head Coach Jovan Vavic was found guilty by a federal jury in Boston. His charges include conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery. 
Prosecutors said Vavic received around $250,000 in bribes for accepting under qualified recruits into the water polo program. 
Vavic led the USC men’s and women’s water polo teams to 16 national championships and won Coach of the Year 15 times during his tenure at USC. He was fired after his arrest in March 2019.
Vavic’s defense incorporated his past coaching success in their argument, asserting that officials at the school demanded that he do whatever he could to raise money for his championship-winning program. They further claimed that Vavic had never lied or taken a bribe. 
His defense also argued that USC has a “pervasive culture” of accepting wealthy students who could later donate money.
The jury convicted Vavic on all counts after a “half-day of deliberations.” 
The “Varsity Blues” investigation ended with 57 people charged in a conspiracy to secure college admission for children of wealthy and famous parents. William “Rick” Singer, the California college admissions consultant who conducted this operation, bribed Jovan Vavic, according to prosecutors.
Singer pleaded guilty in 2019 to all charges, including facilitating cheating on the SAT, and is cooperating with the government.
Prosecutors said the money included $100,000 designating the son of John Wilson — a former executive at Staples and Gap — as a water polo recruit. In addition, Singer paid Vavic $120,000 to cover the private school tuition of his sons. 
Despite USC’s involvement, prosecutors were careful to note that all the universities involved with the scandal are “unknowing victims of the fraud.”

In its triumphant homestand, No. 21 USC women’s tennis came out on top against Washington State, No. 24 Washington, Hawaii and Cal State Northridge, defeating the latter two teams 4-0. 
The impressive win streak moves the Trojans to 14-10 overall and 5-3 in Pac-12 conference play. 
In the first leg of their doubleheader, USC won two doubles matches against Hawaii, securing the first point of the day. Senior Danielle Wilson and Redshirt freshman McKenna Koenig defeated Hawaii seniors ​​Nidhi Surapaneni and Gitte Heynemans 6-0. The next Trojan duo of No. 6 junior Eryn Cayetano and No. 41 senior Salma Ewing defeated Hawaii sophomore Léa Romain and junior Satsuki Takamura 6-2. 
From there, the team never looked back. On the singles courts, Cayetano again beat Takamura 6-1, 6-0. Freshman Leyden Games picked up the third point of the day for the Trojans, beating Hawaii sophomore Madison Kim 6-1, 6-2. To complete the sweep, Ewing defeated Romain 6-4, 6-1. 
A few hours later, the Trojans began their second sweep of the day against Cal State Northridge. 
The duo of Cayetano and Ewing continued their doubles dominance, winning their first match of the day 6-1 against CSUN seniors Joelene Coetzee and Ana Isabel Fraile Toboso. To secure the doubles point for USC, the redshirt freshman twins Gabrielle and Isabelle Lee defeated redshirt freshman Yulia Zhytelna and freshman Jacqueline O’Neill 6-4. 
On the singles courts, USC remained in control. Cheong defeated Fraile Toboso 6-0, 6-2 for the singles point. Games scored the next point for USC, winning against CSUN freshman Jasmine Tolmoyan 6-1, 6-2. 
To close out the match, Cayetano continued her impressive showing, defeating CSUN redshirt senior Ekaterina Repina 6-3, 6-1. 
Sophomore Naomi Cheong said the team looks to build momentum off these bounceback wins. 
“It definitely helps with our confidence,” Cheong said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’re definitely [going to] use these two matches to continue the work that we put in [against] Washington and continue to build that consistency of performance and play.”  
USC won its first match against the Cougars last Friday in a close 4-3 match, despite losing the opening doubles point. 
The Trojans picked up the next two points on the singles courts, as Cayetano defeated Washington State senior Savanna Ly-Nguyen 6-1, 6-3. Willson picked up another singles point for USC after defeating freshman Elyse Tse 6-3, 6-3. 
Freshman Grace Piper took down Cougars freshman Hania Abouelsaad 6-3, 6-3, earning USC its third singles point of the day. However, Washington State kept the match close, picking up a point of its own as No. 77 redshirt freshman Snow Han fell to freshman Maxine Murphy. 
Freshman Sloane Morra secured the match for the Trojans after winning a close one against Cougars senior Yang Lee 7-6(4), 4-6, 6-4. 
Although the Trojans had already clinched the match, Ewing and Cougars fifth year senior Michaela Bayerlova still played out their fixture. Ewing lost the matchup in three closely contested sets, bringing the overall match score to 4-3. 
For their second win of the weekend, the Trojans were dominant against the Huskies. In this ranked matchup, USC stayed in control, winning 4-1. 
The Trojans again failed to secure the doubles point early on, as the Huskies won two of the three doubles matches. But USC quickly got back into the win column, securing four straight singles points. 
Han started off the wins for the Trojans, defeating Washington senior Nika Zupancic 6-2, 2-0 after Zupancic fell to an injury. Cayetano then defeated sophomore Sarah-Maude Fortin 6-1, 6-2. Willson bested Huskies freshman Kelly Leung 6-4, 7-6 (10-9) before Piper secured the match for the Trojans against Huskies sophomore Yolanda Lin 7-5, 7-6 (7-2). 
Cayetano said the team remains locked in as they continue their extended stretch of home games.
“If anything, it’s just getting us closer to our goal and keeping us in that match mindset to play this weekend against Oregon and the following week against UCLA,” Cayetano said. “We’re super excited just to be home and be in front of our family and friends.”

Most workers at coronavirus testing locations will take on other roles within USC Student Health as testing is phased out, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student media health briefing March 8. Some testers were hired as temporary workers and may be let go as testing sites close. Trojan Check workers will receive pay until the end of April, the University said in a series of statements to the Daily Trojan. 
Coronavirus surveillance testing for fully vaccinated individuals ended March 1. USC dropped the measure along with a number of other coronavirus prevention protocols, including the no-guest policy March 1 and the masking requirement March 7. 
The Trojan Check requirement ended April 4. The workers who scanned Trojan Checks at campus entrances, known as the CARE Crew, are temporary workers. Some staff members will continue working to “close down operations,” the University said in a statement. 
“We are looking into employment opportunities throughout USC for positions that may be good matches for these staff members,” the University said. 
Trojan Check began in June 2020 in anticipation for an in-person Fall 2020 semester and has remained in place since. It functioned as a self-reported coronavirus symptom tracker that students, faculty, staff and visitors needed to complete to access campus.
USC first began testing in March 2020 at Engemann Plaza for students with coronavirus symptoms. Surveillance testing, or Pop Testing, began in August 2020. Student Health marked its millionth coronavirus test administered Feb. 14. 
The USC Bookstore and Pardee testing locations have already shut down. Van Orman said testing locations will remain open depending on demand, and as less people get tested, more locations will close. 
“We’re going to really judge it based on the number of tests we’re doing,” she said. 
Van Orman said that, even as surveillance testing winds down, testing will be available for people who are symptomatic, have been exposed and for high-risk individuals for the foreseeable future. 
“We’re undergoing a transition right now in our whole community about when testing happens,” Van Orman said. 
Van Orman said she envisions that, in six to 12 months, coronavirus testing will be similar to flu or strep throat testing, where only symptomatic people go to the doctor to get tested.

The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed the Resolution in Support of the Extension of the Pass/No Pass Grading Option for Spring 2022 Semester in an emergency senate meeting Thursday. The resolution, written by senators Victor Ye and Alvaro Flores, supports a student petition calling for an extension of the Spring 2022 Pass/No Pass deadline, which passed Feb. 11, because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. 
“We urge the Administration to seriously review the recommendations of this representative body and adopt the proposed extension to the grading policy,” USG wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
Senator Ye said that the number of students quarantining in USC sponsored hotels saw an increase compared to numbers from Fall 2021 and that the lack of required testing leads to reduced identification of asymptomatic coronavirus cases. Additionally, not all professors give students the option of joining class on Zoom, he said. 
Antonio Wu, a freshman majoring in public policy, said that, as a spring admit, this semester has proven challenging for him. His first semester in college began online and the rest has been hybrid. He said that the ongoing pandemic has taken a toll on his mental health, causing him to fall behind in some classes.
“We should definitely be given the opportunity to take ownership of our education and extend the pass/no pass deadline and make those decisions for ourselves,” Wu said.
Senator Aidan Feighery, who co-sponsored the resolution, said that the 14.79% peak positivity rate from Jan. 9 to Jan. 15 in addition to the hundreds of students currently in isolation shows the continuation of the pandemic. Students who are currently isolating may return to classes with almost no time to catch up before finals, he said.
“The idea that we are done with the pandemic and that it isn’t affecting students the same way that it did last semester is entirely misguided,” Feighery said. 
Feighery said that, while he understands USC wants to return back to normal, the administration should understand the perspective of students who continue to be impacted by the pandemic and that students have had very different experiences during the semester. He said the decision to not extend the deadline might result from the University trying to protect their interests by preventing the grade inflation that could come from students choosing to change their classes to the Pass/No Pass grading option.
“That desire to go back to normal in no way reflects what COVID currently looks like at USC,” Feighery said.
While the original petition called for an April 15 extension, Ye said the resolution was amended to omit a specific date in order to give administration more flexibility, which he hopes will make the administration more willing to accept it. 
Ye also said that, although the resolution passed, it does not mean the work regarding the subject is over and that this is just the start of the newly inaugurated senators organizing and bringing urgency to the situation. He also encouraged students to continue to push for this change.
“The USG’s passing of this resolution is the tip of the iceberg for other young people to realize the agency of those that represent the elected student body to make this happen,” Ye said. “I hope that this is a first step to making a lot more different changes that we hope with different community organizers, and as well as those that really believe in the power of young people to make this happen.”
The University said it will not be changing or extending the current Pass/No Pass grading policy in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
“We are returning to normal grading practices in the interest of equity for all students,” the statement read. “We advise students to talk with their academic advisors to determine their options.”

USC filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Ernest Kanevsky and Yuguo Bai, who were involved in a series of “prank” YouTube videos filmed at the University. 
Kanevsky and Bai have staged three “panic-inducing classroom takeovers” since 2021, each happening at USC’s Mark Taper Hall of Humanities. The defendants are not affiliated with the University. 
According to the lawsuit, the pranks are suggested to Kanevsky and Bai by their YouTube subscribers as dares with the goal of increasing their social media presence. 
On March 29, Kanevsky entered a classroom during a lecture on the Holocaust dressed as a member of the “Russian Mafia.” Kanevsky asked Bai, who was already seated, if there was a “Hugo Boss” — a fashion designer who made Nazi uniforms during World War II — in the room. Bai said that he was Boss and, at the same time, vulgar language played from his phone. Kanevsky told Bai his father owed him $50,000. After hearing this, students fled the building. Following the incident, Kanevsky and Bai were detained at gunpoint and later arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department. 
In late September 2021, Kanevsky and Bai, along with another person not listed in the lawsuit, entered a data sciences lecture. Kanevsky told the professor that Kanevsky’s father owned the school and he was there to “supervise.” The three perpetrators later escorted the professor from the room, claiming his class was “boring” and later referred to the professor as “dangerous.” Once escorted, they told the class the professor was “taken care of” and began lecturing about the benefits of marijuana. The perpetrators fled before the Department of Public Safety arrived at the classroom. After the incident, the professor requested for a DPS officer to accompany him to classes for several weeks. 
On Nov. 12, 2021, Kanevsky, Bai and two additional people entered another classroom in masked costumes from the television show “Squid Game (2021).” Bai told the professor that he needed assistance in evading people chasing him with weapons. Kanevsky then entered, chased Bai around the room and gave the illusion of kidnapping him. Bai told the members of the class that his mother would die after what had happened. The perpetrators once again fled before DPS arrived. 
The defendants violated University policy on all three occasions by entering Taper Hall, as lecture halls and classrooms are not open to the public. 
USC claims Kanevsky and Bai posed irreparable harm to the University and its members. These harms include physical and emotional damage among students and professors, parental concern, financial harm from increased DPS escorts and emotional support, loss of instructional time and harm to the University’s reputation. 
“The defendants’ conduct has caused University students to experience emotional distress and genuine fear for their personal wellbeing; against the national background of active shooter concerns on college campuses,” the lawsuit read.
USC is seeking a temporary restraining order against Kanevsky and Bai, a preliminary injunction that would restrain them from all University-owned property, compensatory damages and for attorney fees and other lawsuit costs to be covered. 
“Kanevsky and Bai have disrupted the classroom learning environment through provoking extreme fear and anxiety just as Plaintiff, like all institutions of higher education, is attempting to safely return students and faculty to a sense of stability and comfort in an in-person learning environment,” the lawsuit read.

A crowd of janitorial workers and supporters marched from Bovard Auditorium to USC Village Thursday in a continued demonstration calling for higher wages and better health care benefits. The protest follows last Thursday’s negotiations with contractor Aramark, which protesters felt did not adequately address the concerns expressed by the Service Employees International Union. 
Demonstrators carried a banner that read: “Janitors READY 2 STRIKE,” a sentiment also expressed at SEIU-organized protests that took place March 31 on campus and April 1 at Union Hall while negotiations were ongoing. 
Amid rising costs of living and inflation in Los Angeles, workers gathered a turnout of approximately 100 participants demanding respect, dignity and a livable wage. A large portion of the workforce receives less than $17 per hour, which workers, such as Reyna Diaz, said is insufficient to keep up with the cost of living. 
“We’re asking that they respect our work, that they give us a just contract, that they see us as an important part here at the University,” Diaz said in Spanish. “They should consider the cost of living … We are not going to survive on 45 cents.”
One of the lead organizers of the janitorial division at SEIU, Juan Carlos Venegas, said the union looks to challenge last Thursday’s negotiations, as Aramark did not present a counteroffer beyond the 45 cent yearly increase. 
“They’re offering 45 cents a year raises for these workers, and that’s just not acceptable,” Venegas said. “It is disrespectful to offer those kinds of increases at the negotiating table.”
At the rally, speakers protested Aramark’s offered raise and highlighted the funds the University spent settling ex-gynecologist George Tyndall’s case. The University paid out a settlement of over $1 billion in 2021 to former patients treated by Tyndall, who was convicted of sex abuse and unlawful penetration of his patients at the Engemann Student Health Center. 
As USC employs custodians through a third party, Venegas said the University is liable and responsible for a wage increase for the workers, who, he said, perform a valuable and under-appreciated service for the USC community. 
“They show up … in the morning so classrooms are nice and the campus is clean … and they’re doing it for wages that aren’t livable,” Venegas said. “We just ask for them to have some compassion for these workers and show their support for these workers.”
Among student allies of the union were members of USC Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation that collaborated with the union’s representatives and the janitors to organize the rally. Liddy Woodford, a freshman majoring in middle east studies and a member of SCALE, said she believes it is a sign of disrespect for students not to care about the protest’s cause.
“It’s very, very easy to attend a big, prestigious university like USC and get into that money bubble and not realize that there are people who are struggling to pay rent and support their families’ wellness,” Woodford said. “They are members of our community because these are friendly people we see and may or may not interact with every single day.”
SCALE member Nancy Shao, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said students who came out to show their support for the janitors are “angry” that the workers are not paid a livable wage. The coalition, Shao said, hopes their visibility will encourage other students to lend an ear and demonstrate unity for the cause.
“Due to the influence that students can also have on other students, SCALE is mostly here for outreach and we’re trying to make it known that this is what custodians have to deal with,” Shao said. “It’s really important that students stand in solidarity with custodians.”

Students walking down Trousdale on a hot Thursday afternoon may have stumbled across an unexpected little oasis of wellness near Tommy Trojan. 
A new student organization, the Self-Worth Project, encouraged students to uplift each other by writing positive messages.
Founders Maryanne Aziz and Patricia Gerges became friends their first semester at USC and started the Self-Worth Project because they agreed on a need for a community that openly supports and builds each other up and a safe space for students to embrace imperfection and be truthful to each other. While adapting to USC, they connected over shared experiences and observations of student life. 
Aziz, a freshman majoring in health sciences, noticed the impossibly high standards students hold themselves to, and the inevitability of failure in such an environment.
“[USC students] strive to be perfect, but, again, it takes a lot to be perfect,” Aziz said. “It’s hard for people to realize that it’s okay not to get it from the first try.”
Gerges, a junior majoring in health sciences, said her motivation to start the organization came from a realization of how social media furthers an obsession with perfection, and creates a negative culture of comparison.
“When I go on Instagram, I see all these people who go to USC … They seem like they’re having the perfect life, perfect bodies. They’re having fun; they’re getting good grades; everything’s just perfect for them. It seems like they’re living in this perfect world, where I feel like I’m not,” Gerges said. 
Gerges recognized the illusions many of her peers try to uphold and the struggles they feel forced to conceal. 
“I love psychology, and I love to talk to people about mental health and vulnerability,” Gerges said. “When I talk to people, I realize that we’re all struggling in this way, but no one is ready to have this conversation.”
Thursday’s event was the first for the Self-Worth Project. The organization set up a table between the Student Union and Tommy Trojan, which included colorful pens, notecards, candies and frozen yogurt and invited students to stop for a few minutes to perform a random act of kindness. Passersby received uplifting quotes on slips of paper and wrote positive messages that the Self-Worth Project passed on later to other students. The group also offered pieces of candy and cups of frozen yogurt at the event.  
Hulbert Dang, a sophomore majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, participated and said he was touched by the event’s reminder of self-care. 
“A lot of college students get stressed out from studies and forget their mental health,” Dang said. “This is a great way to relieve stress.”
Patricia Garcia, a graduate student studying product development and engineering, also appreciated the event’s positive message and the opportunity to impact another student. 
“You don’t really get stopped by everyday and someone hands you a positive note or positive affirmation,” Garcia said. “I hope whoever reads my note that I wrote, it impacts their day in a positive way.”
In the span of an hour, dozens of students stopped at the table to learn more about the Self-Worth Project and write an uplifting message.
Anthony Khoory, a junior majoring in sociology, oversees logistics for the Self-Worth Project. From his conversations with peers, he realized that students are sometimes “turned off to caring for each other,” contributing to feelings of isolation at USC. He said the Self-Worth Project looks to reinforce a culture where people come together over shared respect and love for each other. 
Khoory said, by offering students the opportunity to write positive messages to each other, the event captures the heart of the Self-Worth Project: the belief that each person has dignity and deserves care.
“Some people have different ways of explaining their self-worth,” Khoory said. “Somebody walking along who comes into contact with us could really have the whole trajectory of their day changed because of their interaction with us.” 
As the organization continues to grow, Aziz and Gerges said they envision the Self-Worth Project growing in two main directions. First, they plan to hold weekly discussions and invite guest speakers, including professionals and experts to explore topics such as meditation strategies and building healthy relationships with one’s body. 
The Self-Worth Project also hopes to expand to the South Central area in the future, allowing USC students to come up with their own projects and becoming mentors in the community by leading presentations or workshops with middle and high school students about self-worth and social media comparison. 
“Just because you don’t fall under the societal standards of obviously looking perfect or having perfect grades or having a social life or whatever, that doesn’t mean that you’re not worthy of love,” Gerges said. “Every person is worthy.”

To passersby on Florence Avenue, one building stands out from the facades. Nestled among the low-slung storefronts is one flat, navy blue structure adorned with two metal-screened windows and a large icon of an open book, “Sims Library of Poetry,” it reads in bold, white letters.
Two murals adorn the property’s front lot. The one facing the street reads, in all caps, “POETRY LIVES HERE.” To the right of the lot, on another blue brick wall, is a painting of poet Langston Hughes accompanied by an altered version of his poem “Dreams.”
Hold fast to Dreams
For when dreams die
Life is a broken winged bird
that cannot fly.
Hold fast to Dreams
For when dreams go
Life is a barren field
covered with snow.
Before Sims Library of Poetry — a community library in Inglewood that offers patrons a space to read, write and perform poetry — moved into its current residence, it lived out of a suitcase then in a garage. But before that, it was a dream in founder Hiram Sims’ head.
“I wanted to put Hughes’ ‘Dreams’ on a wall because I think it’s important for any human being to not only have dreams but to realize that you will have to hold the vision over time to realize it,” Sims said. 
Sims — a 38-year-old Los Angeles native, USC alumnus and poet — first began peddling poetry books by a variety of authors from a suitcase when he taught a poetry class at USC through the Community Literature Initiative. He said his students struggled to find poetry books at local libraries for required reading, but Hiram’s suitcase became a reliable resource for pupils and local poets alike.
After some time and shelf carpentry, Sims decided to expand his collection and open a library in his garage, enlisting friends in the poetry community for help.
“At the beginning of that day, we had my 300 books. All these poets came with boxes. At the end of that day, we had 2,000 books of poetry,” Sims said. “I realized that you could do anything if you could get people to work together.”
Sims Library moved into its current space in the summer of 2020, occupying what was previously a preschool that closed down during the pandemic. It also repurposed its predecessor’s playground into a spongy-floored outdoor patio with couches to stage weekly literary events like workshops, poetry readings and book launches.
Library manager Karo Ska helps organize many of the library’s events. Ska described one recent poetry reading, expressing appreciation for a diverse crowd of newcomers and pointing to events as a source of exposure for the library.
“There were a lot of people that hadn’t been to the library before, so everyone was like, ‘Wait, this place exists? Like, wow, this is amazing,’” Ska said. “That was cool to see people discovering it for the first time.”
Sims Library now holds about 3,000 books. Its collection ranges from vintage copies of classics — such as a second-edition copy of Langston Hughes’ “The Weary Blues” — to one-of-a-kind, handmade periodicals. Many book donations come from Sims’ colleagues in the poetry community and CLI alumni, many of whom are associated with the library.
Sims said he feels grateful to have found people who care about the library, and he’s thankful for patrons, friends and members of the volunteer staff who donate their money, time and labor to the cause.
“If something happened to the library, they would fight to make sure it did not go down,” Sims said. “That, to me, is a greater blessing than $1,000 or 1000 books.”
Sims said one of his goals in opening the library was to encourage people to write poetry, and he believes poets are often discouraged from their artistic ambitions. Many of the library’s volunteers, including Ska, are poets themselves who found Sims Library through CLI classes.
Volunteer Aujrel Pittman said that being part of CLI and Sims Library’s staff helped him realize the potential of his own poetry.
“For me, it allowed me to finally say I can do something professionally with my writing,” Pittman said. “I can take my journal and put it on a shelf at Barnes and Noble … It’s not just, ‘Oh yeah, I’m a writer. I got it back at the house.’”
To further encourage patrons to write, the library also houses a private writing room and work tables with laptops and a printer. Sims said that when visiting other libraries and making plans for his own, he received a wise piece of advice.
“A library is a place for people to do their work. So you have to create elements in your space where people can do their own work,” Sims said. “I thought that was powerful — computers, chairs, books, Wi-Fi, right?”
The library found its home in Inglewood through necessity, Sims said. He promised his students in Fall 2019 that he would move his garage library into a different space by the end of the school year, and the preschool’s closure in 2020 offered him a convenient and affordable opportunity.
Sims also said he lives near the building, so he already knows the local community well. He said he feels particularly validated when new visitors who live nearby come in and express appreciation for the library’s presence, and he’s grateful he can offer the area something new.
“That makes me happy for these Black and brown people to say that they’re proud that we are there,” Sims said. “And, to me, that is indicative of a community, right? When a community says, ‘You’re welcome to be here.’”

Young people have historically been essential to the evolution of cinema. They are the ones who have sustained the ritual of packing theaters — or, in this day and age, racking up streaming numbers — to support work that makes them feel seen and understood. Especially in the French filmic tradition originating in New Wave cinema, youthful angst remains a hallmark element in the types of young people represented on screen.
IFC Films’ slice-of-life movie “Paris, 13th District’’ (“Les Olympiades”), directed by the renowned Jacques Audiard, pays tribute to quintessential French cinema in its depiction of youth while also feeling distinctly contemporary. The narrative twists and turns through a series of the four protagonists’ chance meetings and crossed paths through their careers or romantic pursuits — sometimes even both.
The film comes at a time where Millennials and Gen-Z share the title of “young adult,” both generations facing the bottomless existential dread of a foggy, prophetically Orwellian future amid dwindling career stability, rising college tuition rates and an Internet-dominated reality.
The protagonists of the film reflect archetypes from both demographics. There’s Émilie (played by Lucie Zhang in a standout performance), an eccentric and edgy teenage cherub on the cusp of adulthood — a character reminiscent of Antoine in François Truffaut’s “The 400 Blows.” She works various jobs and craves to be seen as a sovereign adult independent from her family, except she lives in an apartment owned by her grandmother and calls her mom for help when she has a bad drug trip. Émilie also finds herself sexually attracted to Camille (Makita Samba), a high school teacher who moves in with her when she posts an advert looking for a roommate. He’s earned his masters and hopes to get his doctorate yet finds himself taking a “detour in real estate” to make ends meet.
Enter Nora (Noémie Merlant), a modest 33-year-old returning to university to pursue law after leaving her long-term real estate job. Though she’s accomplished and has her life together, Nora’s insecure and out of place — she’s an older college student in a sea of exuberant and crude juveniles. She attempts to fit in and shows up to a spring break rager where she is mistaken for popular cam star Amber Sweet (Jehnny Beth). At first a shattering moment of her delicate self-image, Nora forms an unlikely bond with Amber. The two women, complete foils of one another, connect via paid cam sessions to talk about their lives.
The city of Paris is also a character in and of itself. Audiard serenely captures the 13th District in black and white, framing cityscapes in wide-shot cinematography stylistically reminiscent of Mathieu Kassovitz’s “La Haine.”
The characters, a scope of the many variations of young Parisians, communicate with friends and family through phone calls and suitors through dating apps in an attempt to constitute lives for themselves. Émilie, in particular, represents a cross-cultural bond, as she has family in Taiwan and speaks in her native tongue with her relatives.
The depiction of sex also helps to paint Audiard’s vignette of the everyday lives of the protagonists. Sex positivity, especially casual sex, is an idea many current filmmakers around the world as well as many young people feel passionately about destigmatizing. Audiard also recognizes that there is a spectrum of comfort levels when it comes to engaging in sexual acts. Nora, on the one hand, rarely feels entirely secure in her sexual experiences, whereas Émilie craves sex to the point where she allots days on her calendar to have it.
Then there’s the question of what love is — and it’s not always clear if it can even be defined. Is it a matter of sex, or is there something else missing? Is it a matter of survival, or does it arise when we’re not looking for it? Émilie, Camille, Nora and Amber’s attempts to find these answers make for a simple story about coming of age, but Auidard’s approach to portraying the protagonist’s struggles in life and love make for memorable characters and a thoughtful viewing experience that lingers even after the screen fades to black.
Perhaps introspection is the new form of escapism. It’s evident that narratives exploring the messiness of modern life, such as Joachim Trier’s millennial folktale “The Worst Person in the World” and Sam Levinson’s wildly sensational teen drama “Euphoria,” have facilitated contemplative discourse and catharsis amongst contemporary audiences. “Paris, 13th District” paints modern love not as a quest of its own but as a medium for the exploration and fulfillment of the self. Audiard realizes that self-exploration does not promise a definitive conclusion, there’s pleasure in the process.
“Paris, 13th District” releases exclusively in theaters April 15.

No. 1 USC Beach Volleyball is heading up north to compete in the Pac-12 North Invitational tournament hosted at Stanford this weekend. The Trojans will face four conference opponents over the two day tournament: No. 9 Stanford and No. 12 Cal Saturday followed by No. 17 Arizona and Oregon Sunday.
USC enters the tournament having regained the top ranking in the AVCA coaches poll this week after defeating No. 6 LSU and No. 2 TCU at the UCLA invitational last weekend in Manhattan Beach.
The Trojans carry an 18-dual win streak into this week’s tournament.
“We really want to come in and make a statement,” said graduate student Sunny Villapando in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We have our certain brand of volleyball, which is big and aggressive and fast, and so I think that, when we go in, no matter who we’re playing, we like to keep that consistent look and keep the energy levels the same.”
This weekend, USC will face Cal, Arizona and Oregon for the first time this season. The Trojans have played the Cardinal once already this season, sweeping them 5-0 at Merle Norman Stadium during the Battle for LA Invitational in March. 
However, USC looks to focus on themselves.
“Everytime we play it’s a test to get better,” said Head Coach Dain Blanton. “I really like the focus on improvement, rather than watching the scoreboard. But, we play in a game that has a winner and a loser, so you want to be on that winning end, but, ultimately, you want to be getting better.”
For the Trojans, with only three weeks away from the Pac-12 Championships — which they lost last season to crosstown rival UCLA — each dual is a chance to stay aggressive.
“This is the time where we can really step on the gas, or we can hit cruise control,” said graduate student Hailey Harward. “It’s really important to try to keep pushing our limits and get better everyday. The main focus is just to focus on our side and be very locked in and get that one percent better.”
Harward, along with top court partner senior Tina Graudina, were just named the AVCA Beach Volleyball Pair of the Week. Graduate student Julia Scoles and sophomore Delaynie Maple on court three were awarded Pac-12 Pair of the Week as well. 
Despite the individual success, the Trojans remain focused on pushing the team forward through the final stretch.
“People are looking at our team because of the team’s success, and then people get pair awards and also individual awards come with that,” Blanton said. “The one thing you get to control is when you play matches.”
For the team, building off each other’s success is key to continuing the 18-dual winning streak.
“I love feeding off of when the team is playing, or in a close match, and they’re doing really well and they win,” Harward said. “To see them going all out for it, it just gives me confidence knowing that each court is doing their best.”
Both Villapando and graduate student Caroline Schafer will hope to bring that energy with them as they face their former teams. Villapando will have the chance to return to Stanford, where she played four seasons as an undergraduate, and Schafer will have her first chance to face the Golden Bears, who she played four seasons with. 
Regardless of the unique circumstances, the Trojans are ready and eager to come out to prove their point.
“This group is really, really competitive, and so, regardless of our outcomes every single day we are pushing each other. It’s that competitive energy between each other that propels us forward,” Villapando said. “We’ve reaped some good results in the first half of the season, but, again, it’s not how you start, it’s how you finish, so we’ve got to finish strong.”
USC’s first match of the weekend is 8 a.m. Saturday against Stanford.

The 2021-22 Pac-12 basketball season is over, but it didn’t end with thunderous applause. Instead, the season came to a close the same way most of the conference’s regular season played out — with disappointing loss after disappointing loss.
After a memorable season of Pac-12 basketball, we need to shine a light on those who deserve recognition for both the right and wrong reasons.
Second-Best Player of the Year Award: Terrell Brown Jr., Washington Graduate Guard
I’ve stated before that Arizona sophomore guard Bennedict Mathurin earned the Pac-12 Player of the Year Award. I still stand by that, but Brown’s phenomenal season needs a highlight as well.
On a team that finished with a record of 17-15, Brown could have checked out many times. But he didn’t.
Brown averaged 21.7 points, 4.3 assists and 2.2 steals on a team where he had virtually no help from anyone else. He also put up 30 or more points in four games, but the team went 2-2 in those games. 
Just a little more talent on the roster could have made the Huskies a contender, but Brown did all he could to power the team to an NCAA Tournament berth.
Coach of the Year Award: Tommy Lloyd, Arizona
Is there even a competition? It’s hard to point at anyone except for Arizona’s Tommy Lloyd for this award. UCLA’s Mick Cronin and USC’s Andy Enfield are the only two contenders that come to mind, but Cronin had a solid roster foundation from the previous season and Enfield’s Trojans flamed out in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
Lloyd inherited a fractured roster in the midst of heavy NCAA sanctions and earned that team a No. 1 seed. Think about that for a moment. After being named the Associated  Press Coach of the Year, it’s only right Lloyd earns that distinction in the Pac-12 as well.
Most Frustrating Player If He’s Playing Your Team Award: Kerr Kriisa, Arizona Sophomore Guard
Kerr Kriisa is a decent player. Almost any team would love to have Kriisa as a starter, but to be honest, he might not even be one of the three best players on his own team.
That is, until he’s playing your team. That’s when it’s time to expect a relentless onslaught of 3-pointers from Kriisa and a blowout loss paired along with it. 
Kriisa made seven 3-pointers in a game against Utah toward the end of the season. That’s how it feels to play against this guy. Right when you have an ounce of momentum, Kriisa quiets the arena with a stone-cold jumper.
Surprise Team of the Year Award: Washington State Cougars
This award could have gone in a lot of different ways. Oregon State went 3-28 after making it to the Elite Eight and Arizona went 33-4 with a first-year head coach. Both of those facts are surprising. But a let-down season from the Beavers was due, (although not to this magnitude,) and the Wildcats showed the most consistency of a Pac-12 team in the past decade.
So, I’ll hand this award to the Cougars. Expectations weren’t too high for Washington State heading into the season, but the Cougars ended up finishing fifth, ahead of teams like Oregon and Arizona State which had a decent amount of preseason hype. Washington State’s defense was one of the best in the Pac-12, allowing just 64.9 points per game and 30.6% shooting from behind the arc.
This team wasn’t spectacular but finishing in the middle of the pack is an impressive feat for the Cougars.
Disappointing Team of the Year Award: Oregon Ducks
If you want to defend Oregon’s season, go ahead. Injuries held this team back, certainly. That doesn’t mean this season was anything other than a big disappointment.
The Ducks missed the NCAA Tournament for just the second time in the last nine tournaments. This wasn’t Head Coach Dana Altman’s least talented roster during that stretch either. 
Senior guard Will Richardson averaged 14.1 points per game on 38.8% shooting from the 3-point line, and junior center N’Faly Dante was a phenomenal big next to the basket that gave some of the conference’s top teams fits.
Those performances were not enough to get this team past the quarterfinals in the Pac-12 Tournament or even to a record better than 20-15. 
For a team with preseason aspirations of winning the conference and making a deep NCAA Tournament run, the Ducks missed their mark by more than any other team in the Conference of Champions.

Following two tough losses to rival UCLA last weekend, No. 6 USC men’s volleyball looks to bounce back against Concordia Friday night at Galen Center. The match will open a two-match series, with the Trojans set to visit the Eagles Saturday night.
Last weekend, USC suffered just its fifth and sixth losses of the season when it dropped both matches to its crosstown rivals. After getting swept 3-0 at Galen Center last Thursday night, the Trojans fell to the Bruins 3-2 in Westwood Saturday.
One player who took the two losses to UCLA particularly hard was graduate student outside hitter/opposite hitter/setter Sam Kobrine. After spending five years in the Bruins’ program, Kobrine transferred to USC for his final year of eligibility following the 2021 season.
“It was definitely weird,” Kobrine said about playing against his former team. “They returned a lot of guys, so it was a lot of the same guys that I actually played with the previous year.” 
Adding to the awkwardness of the situation, Kobrine’s brother is on UCLA’s roster. However, Kobrine said he holds no hard feelings toward the Bruins’ volleyball program, and that he transferred for academic reasons.
“Just overall fit,” Kobrine said. “The graduate programs at ‘SC were more aligned with what I was trying to do.” 
For Kobrine and the Trojans to bounce back from their rough series last weekend, taking down a sneaky-good Concordia team is the first step. Despite having a losing record on the season, the Eagles boast four wins over top 25 opponents, including a sweep of a Stanford team that beat USC last month.
“Our biggest key is to just not underestimate anyone honestly,” Kobrine said. “Bringing it every single match is going to be key for us, because, I mean, there’s no bad teams in our league.” 
The match will also serve as senior night for the Trojans. For Kobrine and USC’s other four seniors — all starters/key contributors on the team — it will mark their final match in Galen Center. 
While Kobrine has only been at USC for one season, the remaining four — outside hitter Brandon Browning, graduate student libero Cole Paxson, setter Chris Hall and middle blocker Liam Schroeder — have all spent either four or five years in the program.
If USC wants to take down the Eagles, they will need their veterans to step up, as four of the five lead the team in at least one major statistical category. 
Hall leads the team in assists with a whopping 947,  900 more than the team member with the second most. Paxson leads the Trojans with 191 digs, Schroeder is first on the team with 70.0 blocks and Kobrine ties for the team lead with 26 service aces. 
Not to be outdone, Browning has racked up over 100 kills and digs on the season, ranking in the top four among USC players in both categories.
“There’s definitely a lot of things we can improve upon,” Kobrine said. “Just taking those lessons we learned from UCLA and applying them to Concordia and GCU, who are also great teams.” 
First serve between the Trojans and the Eagles is set for 7 p.m. at Galen Center Friday, with the second match set for the same time Saturday in Irvine.

No. 1 women’s water polo flies to Tempe, Arizona this weekend to battle No. 9 Arizona State in an MPSF clash. The Trojans currently sit at the top of  conference standings, with a perfect 4-0 record, and ride a five-game winning streak.
The team peaks at the right time. USC defeated No. 2 Stanford — ranked No. 1 at the time last Saturday — and No. 13 San Jose State this past weekend. Head Coach Marko Pintaric understands the importance of a Stanford win heading into the final stretch of the year.
“To win a big game like that in an opponent’s pool, it’s very, very motivating,” said Pintaric in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Those games tend to bring extra weight … in the way you prepare for the game. I’m very happy about the way the team reacted. The victory definitely brings confidence.”
There’s many reasons to believe that the Sun Devils matchup will prove victorious for the Trojans. USC has won 37 of the 39 games against Arizona State all-time, including the last 16. In last year’s 2021 NCAA title run, the Trojans defeated the Sun Devils 10-4 in the semis. Arizona State is also 1-3 in MPSF play, with its only win against the Spartans.
But, the Sun Devils are coming off a tightly-contested overtime loss at No. 3 UCLA, so USC is preparing for an intense game.
“We are getting ready for them like any opponent,” Pintaric said. “We don’t want to leave any boxes unchecked. So this week, Arizona is our only preparation and we are looking forward to the game on Saturday.”
Arizona State, as Pintaric notes, is a well-balanced team. The Sun Devils play two left-handed drivers on the right wing, presenting a unique challenge for the Trojans defense. 
Senior 2-meter Mireia Guiral will be key Saturday. Guiral reigns as the MPSF Player of the Week, in part for her four goals across two games but also for her defensive contributions. She stole the ball away six times and had two field blocks.
Guiral and the defense will be tasked with slowing down the Sun Devils’ star freshman driver and the MPSF leading scorer, Vanda Baksa, who’s scored 68 goals in 23 games. Baksa also acts as a willing passer and playmaker with 44 assists on the season. After playing stifling defense against Stanford’s terrific centers, the Trojans will transition to focusing on Baksa, who plays a bit further out on the perimeter.
This is the Trojans’ final game of a four-game road trip, and while the team is excited to return home, they’ve seen positive outcomes from traveling to away games.
“I see that they push through it,” Pintaric said. “It’s a great opportunity for more team bonding … and being tested on the road. I’m going to try to have the best experience possible.”
A win against Arizona State will likely nab the Trojans the top spot in the MPSF tournament, and a victory over the Bruins next week would seal it. The winner of the MPSF tourney, set for the weekend of April 22 at Uytengsu, will earn an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.
The Trojans face Arizona State at 1:00 p.m. Saturday in Tempe.

A phrase in cursive on the palm of your left hand. Your partner’s initials on your right ankle. Two intertwining hearts on your back. People use tattoos to express themselves and the things, people or places important to them. Yet, this art form is often discouraged for fear that it will affect someone’s chances of employment. While this may temporarily dissuade people from getting tattoos, it is not difficult to understand that this axiom does not hold true in the real world. 
Past research from Sage Journals in 2018 concluded that tattoos are associated with a lower level of employability or a more negative opinion of an employee, particularly among older consumers. However, much of this research has to do with perceived discrimination, not “actual discrimination” and “abstract negative attitudes toward body art.” Other research found that a variety of factors had “zero net effect of body art on personal income.”
In the Harvard Business Review, University of Miami professor Michael French explains that, in his study surveying more than 2,000 people, he expected to find “a wage penalty or employment difficulties, because hiring managers have said in previous studies that they’d discriminate against tattooed candidates.” However, the study found no such result. 
Nowadays, tattoos have gained greater acceptance, with 44% of people in the United States sporting at least one tattoo, according to a 2019 study by the Statista Research Department. As the causation study showed, showcasing some ink will not affect chances of landing a job. Some conntries go as far as to prohibit discrimination of people for job positions if they have tatoos. According to Inhersight, in the U.K., U.S. and many other countries, it’s still legal for companies to have a ‘no tattoo’ policy.
There is no reason that one’s self-expression—excluding tattoos that display offensive language or implications—should be frowned upon. Tattoos can make someone feel more whole and confident in themselves. Humans have used their bodies for artwork for thousands of years through tattooing, as evidenced by Ötzi, a man whose body has been preserved for 5,300 years. He himself sports some body art, as do human remains from 3,000 years ago found in Russia, Chile, China and Egypt. Something with such a deeply rooted history should not be looked down upon, especially since the majority have no intention of causing harm with their tattoos. 
As UCLA Chief of Mental Health Community Care Systems,  Dr. Joseph Pierre puts it, tattoos tell stories that words can not. As a psychotherapist, Pierre encourages using tattoos as a means of learning about a person’s important life events or troubles. Parents may get a tattoo that mimics that of their late son, or a cancer survivor may choose to get a “survivor” tattoo which can help them recover emotionally. Tattoos serve various purposes for many different people, and there should be no reason for their professionalism to get affected. 
Someone who has tattoos should not be held back from doing great work. Tattoos do not keep someone from being a good leader, a cooperative team member or a resourceful employee. A person who is more sure of themselves because of their body art could be more likely to put their best foot forward in their job. Someone’s job is only a part of their identity and the same goes for tattoos, so why would their tattoos define who they could be as a worker? 
It is up to this generation to change the narrative of tattoos and employment so that future generations are not held back from letting their creativity show. At the end of the day, we all have control of our own bodies and should not be judged or chastised for doing so.

The rave scene — a space with flashing lights, fast-paced electronic dance music and the liberal use of drugs — is an escape to a world where worries don’t exist. In studying this scene, the university student is the model organism for under standing the social and neurological phenomenon behind raves and music festivals such as Beyond Wonderland and Coachella.
“Rave” music derives from European techno music and American house music and first flourished in the United States and U.K. By definition, according to The Sociological Quarterly, “raves are grassroots organized, anti-establishment and unlicensed all-night dance parties featuring various genres of electronically produced dance music.” 
At raves, the music brings everyone together. When we listen to our favorite songs, the pupils in our eyes dilate and our hearts race as the cerebellum, a region in our brain responsible for movement, becomes active. At USC’s Brain & Creativity Institute, the Brain & Music Lab currently studies the relationship between music, psychology and neuroscience to understand the neural dynamics of connective emotion in response to music throughout our lifespan.
Music itself resembles a drug. Listening to music can relieve stress and this heightens when a person is high, creating a transcendent experience like no other. Clinical studies have even found that LSD enhances music-evoked emotion and volunteers reported feelings of “wonder, transcendence, power and tenderness,” which is where the use of drugs comes into play.
According to the University of Kent, raving and the use of psychedelics can help create “meaningful bonds” and prove useful in clinical therapies, respectively. In this study, Dr. Martha Newson discovered that, among the “4Ds” that alter states of consciousness — dance, drums, sleep deprivation and drugs — dancing and drugs, particularly psychedelics, were most strongly associated with strengthening social bonds. 
Though recreational mind altering trips from psychedelics have deep-rooted stigmas associated with them, their clinical applications should be recognized from a public health perspective.
Ketamine’s potential as a mental health treatment is seen in evidence supporting neuronal regrowth in the prefrontal cortex, the focal site for brain disorders such as depression and anxiety. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved testing of MDMA as a possible treatment for PTSD. Ketamine and MDMA are part of a growing field that explores party drug use in psychedelic therapies for behavioral and psychiatric disorders.
However, rave culture should not center around drugs. Even if raves are associated with drugs, this association shouldn’t be perceived in a negative light as these same drugs have clinical applications. The music and  people make raves truly enjoyable. 
The unity and togetherness at raves and music festivals lies at the heart of the rave experience. Raves should be viewed positively because of  the overwhelming benefits from listening to music in such an open and accepting environment. It is the freedom and connectedness that you feel when surrounded by the people you love, or even strangers who share the same sentiment for the artist and are there for a good time.
Now, if you’re thinking about going to your first rave but are hesitant because you don’t know the artist or don’t think you would enjoy it, I’d encourage you to go for the experience. Go for the vibes, neuroscience supports it.
