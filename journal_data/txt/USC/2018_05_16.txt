The University administration announced in a memo Wednesday evening that USC had received 85 reports and responses regarding a gynecologist who was fired due to allegations regarding sexually inappropriate and racially insensitive behavior.
In the memo, Senior Vice President for Administration Todd Dickey and Provost Michael Quick thanked those who reported their experiences with gynecologist George Tyndall following a memo from President C. L. Max Nikias Tuesday regarding Tyndall’s firing. The memo said a large amount of those who reported new information about Tyndall were former students.
“We are taking great care to respond to all persons individually, and to make sure that everyone is receiving our full support, as well as our compassion and understanding,” the letter stated. “Every response — whether identified or anonymous — is extremely important to us, and is being carefully addressed to determine the appropriate referral or follow up.”
Dickey and Quick invited those with more information on Tyndall’s conduct to continue submitting reports, and to contact University counselors if needed. 
“We want to reiterate that each individual report is being handled with sensitivity,” the letter stated. “We care deeply about how this matter has affected each person in our community, and we are dedicated to providing the most compassionate support we can.”
Tyndall was put on administrative leave in June 2016 and later terminated by the University in June 2017 following an investigation into his conduct with patients at the student health center.
In 2016, the USC Office of Equity and Diversity looked into Tyndall’s conduct at the student health center during physical examinations. A Los Angeles Times report found that several of Tyndall’s patients submitted letters to the University since the early 2000s.
“We understand that any unacceptable behavior by a health professional is a profound breach of trust,” Nikias wrote in the original memo. “On behalf of the university, I sincerely apologize to any student who may have visited the student health center and did not receive the respectful care each individual deserves.”

Studying abroad is one of the most life-changing and rewarding experiences of a student’s college career. Learning to fend for yourself in an entirely foreign country can help facilitate personal growth, broaden your worldview and strengthen valuable life skills. But before you board the plane, here’s a travel checklist to ensure a smooth experience:
Speak with a study abroad advisor to make sure you have completed all the necessary paperwork. Your passport must be valid throughout your semester abroad, and at least six months after (some countries require one year). Apply for a student visa if necessary. It may take a few days for the visa office to process your application, so do this well in advance! Rush processing fees can really add up. Don’t forget to check the State Department’s website for any other documentation required to enter the country.
Make sure to exchange currency
Contact your bank to check if it has the currency you’ll need abroad. If you’re thinking of taking weekend trips to other countries, check which currencies they accept. As a general rule, it’s always better to have more money in case of emergencies. Bring U.S. dollars if your bank doesn’t have enough currency to last throughout your trip; most airports have kiosks to exchange currency.
Authorize your credit card
Let your bank know that you’ll be making purchases abroad to prevent getting locked out of your credit card. Check which credit cards are accepted in the country. Some credit cards may have foreign transaction fees, so it’s usually better to pay in cash; or, you can apply for a travel rewards credit card if you’re a frequent globetrotter. If you plan to visit night markets or local stores, many vendors may only accept cash.
Ensure you’re covered
Explore the various international data plans that your cell provider offers. Some charge by day, some are monthly plans, and some have a rate per megabyte. Or, you can purchase a SIM card if your phone is unlocked. Even if you don’t think you’ll need to access your phone off-campus, you can download maps offline from Google Maps, which can be a lifesaver in an unfamiliar place. You’ll also be able to call your trip contact or emergency services. If you only want international calling services, a cheap and user-friendly option is Skype credit. 
Make a bucket list
This is your chance to explore an entirely new country, learn about its culture and find your favorite places. Make a list of all the must-sees and take the scenic routes if you have time; you can even make a personalized Google Map of all the places you want to visit. For a more authentic experience, ask a local for their favorite hidden gems. You never know what you might discover.
Pack light
The fewer bags you pack, the easier your life will be. Only pack the essentials, because you’ll definitely leave with more than you came with. Make sure you have enough prescription medication, contact lenses and other necessities you won’t be able to obtain abroad. You’ll be able to buy toiletries, stationery and snacks once you’re there. 
Ask a friend
Learn from an expert, and ask a student who has completed the same study abroad program for advice on what to wear or what to bring. They’ll know all the tips and tricks specific to your program. Or, ask a friend who lives in that country for advice on how to get around and what sights to see.

For high school and college students, summertime is associated with jobs and internships, extra classes and test preparation, as everyone scrambles to get ahead of the curve. As we grow older, we often forget the magic of summer, where no school meant hours of free time to explore your surroundings and enjoy everything that life has to offer. Here are some fun, quintessentially summer activities you can indulge in in between working a 9-5 and studying for the LSAT:
Catch an outdoor movie
During the sweltering summer months, everyone flocks to the movie theater for the chance to sit in a dark, air-conditioned room for a couple hours. Instead, avoid the crowds and catch your favorite flick once the sun goes down at an outdoor screening.  Rooftop Cinema Club screens fan favorites atop skyscrapers in Hollywood and downtown L.A.; Street Food Cinema brings together food trucks and classic movies. Or, if you’re looking for more of an old-timey experience, Paramount Drive-In Theatres or Vineland Drive-In allow you to  munch on popcorn and cuddle while watching a film in the comfort of your own car. 
Go tidepooling
Hitting the beach and playing in the waves is fun, until a particularly large one knocks you over and you have to drag yourself, sputtering, out of the water with seaweed in your hair. Instead, go exploring during the low tide and discover the sea creatures that lurk just beneath the surface. Poke a sea anemone and watch its tentacles unfurl in, or let a tiny hermit crab scuttle across your palm — you never know what you might find. Leo Carrillo State Park in Malibu, Calif. and Golden Cove Beach in Palos Verdes, Calif. are home to stunning ocean life. 
Pick your own fruit
There’s nothing like biting into a ripe, juicy strawberry freshly plucked off the vine — and then bringing home a whole basketful for later. Summer is a time of abundance, as strawberries, raspberries, cherries, watermelons and more all come into season. Hitch a wagon ride through the fields at Tanaka Farms in Irvine, Calif., or give the “olallieberry,” a blackberry-raspberry hybrid, a try at Underwood Family Farms in Ventura County.
Have fun at the fair
County fairs are a summertime staple; there’s nothing like trying your luck at the rigged ring toss at the carnival to characterize the adolescent experience. Feel free to indulge in a plate of funnel cake, but only after you’ve ridden the rollercoaster. The Orange County Fair runs from Jul. 13 to Aug. 12. and the Los Angeles County Fair takes place between Aug. 31 and Sept. 23.

Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino is the sixth studio album by the English indie rock band Arctic Monkeys. In a complete departure from their previous sound, the tracks on Tranquility are ethereal and transcendent. Courtesy of Domino Recording Company
The Arctic Monkeys’ latest album Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino combines masterful vocals with dreamy, smooth instrumentals, complete with crooning lyrics sung in lead singer and frontman Alex Turner’s signature Sheffield accent. Released on May 11, the 11-track LP is almost a complete deviation from the British indie rock band’s earlier works. Unlike their 2013 album AM, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino is nearly devoid of emblematic anthems, heavy guitar riffs and traditional rock elements. Instead, it seems to suggest a warping of time and space, revolving around futuristic piano sounds and breezy lyrics that make it a smooth listen. 
Considered by critics as the Arctic Monkeys’ most daring album to date, Tranquility was written in Turner’s home studio in Los Angeles, which he calls the “Lunar Surface,” a reference to Stanley Kubrick’s conspiracy theory of the fake moon landing. The album was crafted on an upright Steinway piano gifted to Turner for his 30th birthday, interweaving concepts of sci-fi, outer space, technology, fame and politics through pointed lyrics and velvety instrumentals. 
The song lyrics are lilting and ethereal, transporting listeners to a state of wonderment. The album’s first track “Star Treatment” opens with the lines: “I just wanted to be one of The Strokes / Now look at the mess you made me make / Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase / Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway / I’m a big name in deep space,” making vague allusions to pop culture and telling of strange journeys to fantastic worlds beyond our own. The lyrics appear to be written as a stream-of-consciousness,  forcing listeners to carefully analyze implicit messages and meanings throughout the introspective work. 
On“Science Fiction,” Turner sings, “The rise of the machines / I must admit you gave me something momentarily / In which I could believe” with the chorus “I want to stay with you, my love / The way science fiction does.” The words once again adhere to the overall sci-fi theme, set in the eponymous virtual moon casino. In an interview with Pitchfork, Turner said the deliberate choice to discuss an outer world was informed by his understanding of the current world we live in. Thus, the exploration of a surreal intercosmic space became the focal point of his social commentary. Few lyrics repeat themselves and the songs appear to have been modeled after the convoluted, ever-changing nature of space. Despite their unconventional lyrics, the Arctic Monkeys’ sixth album delivers a transcendent sound. Perhaps Turner’s intent wasn’t for listeners to understand, but rather for them to enjoy Tranquility as an immersive sonic experience. 
One can only imagine Turner lounging in a spacecraft bar wistfully musing over the existential affairs on Planet Earth, analyzing the current state with a critical — and often cynical — eye. Unpacking his lyrics proves to be no easy task and listeners can only speculate what exactly Turner aims to critique through his cryptic selection of lines.  is expertly polished, slow with a twang, and experimental, tapping into each listener’s inner psyche. It is also a transformative take on the Arctic Monkeys’ widely-known sound, ultimately providing a fresh comeback for the band after a three-year hiatus.

On his newest record Voicenotes, Charlie Puth fails to make a lasting impact on listeners, with simple songs that feature catchy, repetitive melodies and laughably juvenile lyrics. Courtesy of Atlantic Records
New Jersey native Charlie Puth rose to fame after penning the Furious 7 smash hit song “See You Again” with Wiz Khalifa. The music video for the track was briefly the most-viewed video on YouTube, catapulting Puth to pop radio stardom. The singer-songwriter continued breaking into the mainstream with collaborations with artists such as Selena Gomez and Meghan Trainor, leading to the release of his debut record Nine Track Mind. Though the record was met with mixed reviews, many critics recognized Puth’s potential to become a staple in pop music. 
Two years after his debut, the “Attention” singer has returned with sophomore record  Voicenotes. Months before its release, singles  “Attention” and “How Long” reached Top 40 radio. To perfect his vision, Puth delayed the project, reshooting the cover art.
Released on May 11, the 13-track LP has few — and fleeting — moments of originality. Its lyrics are overly banal, its production too simple and repetitive and its vocals far from versatile. The falsetto Puth adopts on “Patient” is cringeworthy, and the remaining tracks continue to use  the same cadence or are sung in the same key.
Puth attempted to inject some life into his songs by collaborating with Boyz II Men, Kehlani and James Taylor, but even they could not save Voicenotes from being a snoozefest. While “If You Leave Me” finds Puth giving his best attempt at a Boyz II Men impression, “Done for Me” shows the singer being overshadowed by his duet partner Kehlani. 
The best moments on Voicenotes are the opener and closer. “The Way I Am” is Puth’s personal reminder to stay true to himself, even if listeners love or hate him.  “Through It All” alludes to the inner turmoil the singer has faced in his rise to fame, as well as the challenges he  has overcome. These two tracks succeed in  authenticity and  introspection, which are lacking on the rest of the album.
Unfortunately, Voicenotes is plagued  with uninspiring, easily forgotten love songs that touch on the same tired topics. The ’80s inspired “Boy” tells the story of  a patronizing lover condemning his immaturity; “Attention” details a vitriolic Puth calling out his ex-lover for reveling in his attention but not his love for her. The James Taylor collaboration “Change” seeks to tackle current ideological divides, but its laughably juvenile lyrics fail to command listeners’ attention or merit serious consideration. 
Until Puth finds a distinct sound and a team of producers to cultivate  fresh, compelling tracks, the singer will continue to be a mediocre presence in the pop industry.

The National Institute of Health recently launched a nationwide data project seeking at least one million American volunteer participants. NIH partnered with the USC Keck School of Medicine and several other organizations for the $1.5 billion All of Us Research Program, which seeks to enhance health research breakthroughs and discoveries. 
Daniella Meeker, assistant professor of preventive medicine and director of Clinical Research Informatics, is the program’s principal investigator. Meeker emphasized how USC plays a particularly important role in this project because of its location in Los Angeles County, one of the most ethnically diverse communities in the country. 
“USC is uniquely positioned to help the team achieve its diversity goals,” Meeker said in a USC press release. “This initiative will inform the way that health care and precision medicine is created in the future. It’s like the human genome project but for the entire American population.”
A diverse participant pool is the NIH’s priority for this project, potentially establishing the largest DNA and health database for medical research in the world. By studying people from a wide variety of backgrounds, researchers will be able to gather biological, genetic, environmental and lifestyle information, especially from populations typically underrepresented in medical research. This will help with preventing and treating a multitude of diseases.
“The All of Us Research Program is an opportunity for individuals from all walks of life to be represented in research and pioneer the next era of medicine,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins. in an NIH press release. “The time is now to transform how we conduct research — with participants as partners — to shed new light on how to stay healthy and manage disease in more personalized ways. 
Since participant enrollment opened on May 6, tens of thousands of volunteers have already signed up. The program asks participants to fill out health surveys and to share electronic health records online. The website details how it plans to protect participant data and explains how being a part of the study can directly benefit both parties by helping the participant learn more about their own health. 
“The All of Us Research Program is part of the Precision Medicine Initiative,” the program’s website states. “Precision medicine is health care that is based on you as an individual. It takes into account factors like where you live, what you do, and your family health history.”
In addition to Keck, the USC Gehr Family Center for Health Systems Science and USC School of Pharmacy will also contribute to the project.

Graduating students of the animation and digital arts program learned to express their creativity through animation and film and presented the finished products to friends and family. Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The John C. Hench Division of Animation and Digital Arts held its annual graduation showcase Saturday evening at the USC Eileen Norris Cinema Theatre. Students who received degrees in the Bachelor of Arts, Master of Fine Arts or minored in animation and digital arts had the opportunity to present an animated short film to parents, friends and alumni on the big screen.
“The graduation showcase is the culmination of all their long, hard work,” Exhibitions Director of Hench-DADA Lisa Mann said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It is a tremendously exciting, cathartic moment when they can sit in the darkened theater with 400 guests, to watch and hear the audience’s reactions … be it laughter or tears, but always massive cheers.”
The evening began with the presentation of short films from the undergraduates. A reception after the screening specially highlighted students who worked with virtual reality. The graduate student projects were shown on the big screen afterwards.
The showcase was a culmination of three semesters of work from students who were in the BA and MFA programs and from two who were in the minor track.
“The BA and MFA students spend the spring semester of their third and second year respectively in ideation classes designed to help them find and develop their projects,” associate professor Trixy Wattenbarger said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “At the end of this ideation semester, students pitch their ideas to the full faculty for approval.”
Students were free to model their projects after any subject they desired. The stories ranged from a Viking on a quest to avenge her sister’s death to a struggling mother trying to provide for her daughter. 
“The works are all unique creations from every student. Some themes do repeat, like childhood memories and stories,” associate professor Kathy Smith said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “For others, they are dealing with issues directly impacting their lives like the refugee crisis, climate change or gender identity.”
There was a multitude of pieces that were shared. For example, Barry Strum, who received a bachelor of arts degree in animation and digital art, created the film “Pyramid Scheme.” Strum’s project tells the story of a mummy who searches for a romantic partner on the Las Vegas Strip, thinking he is in ancient Egypt.
“I came up with the idea for my piece in an art history class two years ago,” Strum said. “We were studying Tutankhamun and I had to go to Vegas one weekend, and I was like, ‘Why not put the two together?’”
After the students decided what story to base their film on, they created teams to determine the type of animation style their project would specifically implement. 
“Computer graphics is very difficult and it takes a lot of people to work one film,” Strum said. “I needed to make a team and find people and it’s really hard to do that within a budget. But it worked out really well and I got such great help and such great teammates.”
According to Strum, group members fulfilled a variety of roles, including modelers, voice actors and composers to score the project. Students were also paired with a faculty mentor and class advisor to receive feedback and guidance during the creative process. 
Presenting at the showcase gave the graduating students an opportunity to learn what it takes to create a quality film under time and budget constraints. This event also inspired other undergraduate students within the School of Cinematic Arts. 
“The show allows them to recognize their success and prepares them to face the next steps in their career trajectories,” Wattenbarger said. “Animation is still a relatively small community and gaining exposure to alumni and the public puts them in an excellent position to strengthen their network.”

The USC women’s water polo team defeated Stanford in a dogfight in the NCAA National Championship by a final score of 5-4 at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center. The title has bounced between the Trojans and the Cardinal since 2010, intensifying the longstanding rivalry between the two athletic programs. 
This time, however, the match for the ring ended with the entire USC team, coaching staff and even Athletic Director Lynn Swann plunging into the pool, celebrating its nearly flawless 26-1 season. 
The Women of Troy were coming off of a dominating performance in the semifinals, where they defeated UCLA in a 10-6 match in Trojan waters to secure their spot in the finals. Freshman driver Paige Hauschild scored 3 goals to help earn the victory, setting a new freshman scoring record at USC and giving her the confidence to step up in the finals. 
The final match against Stanford started as a strictly defensive game, with both teams remaining scoreless after the first quarter. Halfway through the second quarter, Stanford drew first blood on a goal from senior defender Jordan Raney. USC’s senior captain and driver Brianna Daboub responded with the Trojans’ first goal of the game to leave the match tied at halftime. 
Stanford’s junior driver Madison Berggren opened the second half with a goal. The Trojans quickly fought back with sophomore driver Denise Mammolito tying up the score. The Cardinal’s sophomore driver Makenzie Fischer answered to give Stanford the upper hand. However Hauschild found the back of the net to close out the third quarter, leaving USC and Stanford tied once again. 
USC took its first lead 30 seconds into the fourth quarter after another goal from Mammolito. It was now the Stanford’s turn to match USC, and the Cardinal depended on junior Kat Klass to execute. With fewer than  two minutes left, Mammolito completed her hat trick to give USC its final lead of the season, ending the game with a score of 5-4. 
Goalies on both ends had a stellar defensive performance. Stanford’s redshirt senior goalkeeper Julia Hermann ended with nine saves, while the Trojans’ junior Amanda Longan had 10 saves. Critical assists from sophomore utility Maud Megens, senior utility Hayley McKelvey and sophomore driver Kelsey McIntosh were a significant factor in USC’s title-winning performance. Hauschild’s four steals were essential to establishing the Trojans’ consistent ball control and confident possessions. 
Following the match, Longan was named the 2018 NCAA Women’s Water Polo All-American Tournament Team MVP. 
“We were able to hold our heads up the whole time being down for a little while there. And you can feel it out there is what held us in that game, knowing that everything we worked so hard for all year is on the line,” Longan said. “We were playing with ease just for the fact that we were prepared. And even when things weren’t going our way, it didn’t matter. We knew we were going to get through it.” 
She demonstrated strong leadership throughout the season, especially during the championship match.
Mammolito, Hauschild and Daboub earned first team honors, while Megens secured a spot on the second team for her efforts throughout the season and her assist in USC’s final victory. 
The Women of Troy were led by Jovan Vavic in his 24th season as head coach. Vavic also serves as the head coach of the USC men’s team, and has now earned a total of 15 national championships (six with the women and nine with the men) during his time at USC. He has played an instrumental role in USC’s water polo programs as the Pac-12 Coach of the Century, 13-time National Coach of the Year and 12-time MPSF Coach of the Year. He has coached 12 recipients of the Cutino Award, the most prestigious collegiate water polo honor given to one female and one male athlete each year. 
“They worked so hard,” Vavic said. “They really wanted this. They are just a fabulous group, and I really wanted it for them. When good things happen to good people, you just love it.” 
The Women of Troy attributed their success this season to the stellar coaching job from Vavic.
“Just pushing through like Jovan [Vavic] says, always play with heart and never give up. Always working for that next possession, that next center play, just keeping going,” McKelvey said. “It’s nice to be on top again. It just felt good to be back on top again.”

School may be over, but the USC baseball team is still hard at work, having won two out of three games against Washington State this past weekend. 
April was a challenging month for USC, as the team went 6-10 and earned just one series victory (against Arizona State). The struggling Trojans looked poised for yet another season of losses. But recently the team has reversed its course, catching fire in the month of May. 
Two weeks ago, USC defeated Cal twice in a row to secure its third conference series of 2018. The Trojans followed up by defeating Washington State last Friday and Sunday, giving the team its first consecutive series wins of the 2018 campaign. Now, USC is back at .500 with a chance to notch its first winning record in three years. 
The keys to USC’s small-scale “resurgence” have been solid hitting and capitalizing with runners in scoring position — the latter being an area the team has struggled in all season (the team is ninth in the Pac-12 in runs batted in). In their two wins over now-29-19 Golden Bears, the Trojans converted 27 hits into 20 runs scored. Even when USC dropped a game 6-2, it still managed to record 10 hits against Cal, proving the team’s ability to notch hits against tough competition. 
USC carried over its hot-hitting streak into this weekend’s series against Washington State. On Friday, the Trojans defeated the Cougars 8-6, anchored by a three-hit, three-RBI performance from redshirt junior designated hitter Stephen Dubb. 
The Trojans would go on to lose to Washington State 8-4 on Saturday, preventing a much-needed sweep of the 15-27-1 Cougars. USC once again turned in a solid day at the plate, with 11 hits from nine different players. But pitching woes haunted USC early on, as junior starter Quenten Longrie (4-5) gave up 6 earned runs in the first three innings. USC’s batting order was unable to close the gap. A 4-run surge in the eighth and ninth innings proved to be insufficient, forcing a series-deciding game on Sunday afternoon. 
USC got out to an early advantage on Sunday thanks to location trouble from Cougars junior starting pitcher Parker McFadden. He walked four batters in the second inning alone, giving up 2 runs on walks with the bases loaded. McFadden was quickly replaced by sophomore reliever AJ Block. In the fourth inning, USC exploded with 4 runs including one off of a double by junior outfielder Lars Nootbaar. Nootbaar displayed his best hitting performance of the season, with a season-high four hits in five at-bats. 
“It was good to see [Nootbaar] get four hits,” said USC head coach Dan Hubbs in a video posted on the team’s Twitter page. 
The Trojans compounded their early lead with 3 runs in the final two innings, finishing off the series with a 9-3 victory. Junior starting pitcher Solomon Bates handled the Cougars’ batting order with aplomb. He pitched seven innings, gave up just 2 runs (on two home runs) and struck out seven batters. 
“Any time we get seven strong innings, you know we have a good shot,” said Nootbaar of Bates performance. “[Bates] did his job today and offensively we took care of business.” 
Later this week, USC will stay home for a series against No. 4 Oregon State. The 38-8-1 Beavers are coming off of a series loss to No. 2 Stanford.

Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan
There is a major problem with youth sports. Year after year, high school — and even middle school — athletics are becoming increasingly intense. Sports have become much more competitive, and teams must work harder to combat their competition. But these changes are significantly hurting young athletes. Practices now last longer, games are scheduled more frequently and “off-seasons” are disappearing. On the surface, there seems to be nothing wrong with this — teams and players are simply looking to outwork their opponents. But in reality, these young athletes are now being forced into situations that put them even more at risk of injury. 
The public discourse on safety in youth sports heavily focuses on football. While football is an incredibly dangerous sport that is in dire need of technological advancements and rule changes, the aforementioned changes in structure pose as a silent killer. I have not only witnessed this — but I also have experienced it. 
I was raised as a multi-sport athlete. There was not a season of the year where I wasn’t playing a sport. Baseball in the spring, golf in the summer and hockey in the fall and winter. I was a model athlete. I was the type of athlete high school students aspired to be, but before long I succumbed to the cultural shift in youth sports. I stopped golfing to make time for a longer baseball season. A couple years later I stopped lacing up my skates to make room for baseball. 
You might ask, “Who plays baseball in the winter in the state of Michigan?” Every coach I have ever played under will answer with the same response: “Those who want to play in the spring.” 
I entered high school as a single-sport athlete. Baseball was the only sport I played, and I played it 12 months of the year. I’m not saying that no one can be a multi-sport athlete, but I felt that if I wanted to be the best baseball player I could be, that’s what I had to do. That, precisely, is the problem with youth sports today: Kids are “specializing” way too early, and this is leading to more risks and injuries. Any prolonged athletic activity can cause physical damage without proper care. There must be a balance with other activities and ample recovery care.
The summer after junior year of high school, I tore my labrum. I was fortunate enough to only partially tear my arm and was not required to undergo surgery. Before I continue, there was a lot I could have done to minimize the injury to my arm. I could have stretched, ran and iced more frequently. However, this does not subtract from the main problem with the state of youth baseball. 
With my high school team I practiced two to three hours each day, with games sprinkled throughout the week. Immediately after the high school season, I began my travel season, which lasted into August. And after the travel season? Fall-ball season. After fall-ball was the winter season, when I spent most days in the batting cages hitting, throwing and catching bullpen sessions. There was no break. Every time I played baseball I was using the same muscles and performing the same motions. This repeated, non-stop stress ultimately led to the tearing of my labrum. I am not alone. This is the story of thousands of athletes in various sports across America. 
The name Tommy John is feared by every baseball player, especially pitchers. The infamous ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction surgery named after former Yankees’ pitcher Tommy John is often known as the career-ending surgery among professional pitchers. It used to only be a concern among players in the majors, who at the time were the only ones who could throw hard enough and frequently enough to require the surgery.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the case. Young pitchers today are throwing harder, more often and for longer periods of time than ever before. The American Journal of Sports Medicine conducted a study that found that athletes between the ages of 15 and 19 account for 56.8 percent of UCL reconstruction procedures. That is a staggering statistic, and it bothers me that the sport of baseball is able to have negative effect on youth athletes. 
I firmly believe that there must be increased safety measures implemented in all youth sports. We have already seen the early stages of these changes take form in pitch counts and rest days for pitchers, but that simply isn’t enough. Dedicated team recovery days, limited practice lengths and mandatory off-seasons (which allow players to play another sport without pressure from coaches) are just a few examples of how we can minimize the risks athletes face from playing their respective sports. 
These types of changes won’t be easy to implement. Players and coaches will almost always find a way around the rule in effort to “gain an edge” on their opponents, but these first steps are fundamental to raising more awareness the dangers of youth sports today.

Last Friday, media mogul Oprah Winfrey delivered a commencement speech to graduates of the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. In her 23 minute-long speech, Winfrey dished out several familiar, commencement-style blanket statements as she encouraged the crowd of Annenberg graduates to make the world a “better place.”
But she also posed a challenging question: “What are you willing to stand for?” 
In the world of journalism, many have asked this question and many have refused to answer. To reporters who have been trained to approach stories with complete objectivity, the idea of “taking a stand” — of advocating for a certain cause — is nothing more than a disruption to their search for absolute, unadulterated truth. But we need to realize that, in many ways, exposing the truth is in fact a form of advocacy. And it’s not a bad thing. It’s journalism.
Reporters have had a long history of stepping outside the boundaries of objectivity and pushing for what they saw as positive change to society. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, people who took on this role were known as “muckrakers”: Investigative journalist Ida B. Wells, for example, was a leading figure in the anti-lynching movement. In 1968, renowned television news anchor and “most trusted man in America” Walter Cronkite famously opposed U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War during a special CBS News broadcast — which, in turn, shifted the attitudes of a public that was becoming increasingly distrustful of the government.
Today, as the label of “fake news” looms over the industry like a dark cloud, many reporters have shied away from the idea that their work should have a specific purpose. In an increasingly digital environment where encyclopedias of information can be accessed with a few finger taps, many of journalists’ duties have been determined by their responsibilities to take the most pertinent stories and present them in a manner the public can understand — to make sense of a chaotic amount of information.
This concept represents a shift in perceptions of what Winfrey referred to as the “editorial gatekeeper”: Whereas journalists were once able to control what information the public can access, the rise of social media platforms and “citizen journalism” has made that information ubiquitous and, at times, uncontrollable. But while they may not always take an overt stand like Wells or Cronkite, the reporters disseminating and repackaging content are inherently active players in their stories as well.
Journalists have long debated whether they should write for or about a community. But, as previously mentioned, the two options are often inextricably linked — intentional or not. We must realize that although many journalists may execute an objective reporting technique — resembling an uninvolved yet informed bystander — they contribute to the values and beliefs of the community they are writing about. The choices they make in including and excluding certain perspectives all contribute to the general message readers take away from a story. 
Therefore, considering that they have a powerful and far-reaching platform at their disposal, journalists have an obligation to speak both their voices as well as those of populations who remain unheard. As Oprah mentioned in her speech, graduating from college is a privilege not everyone has access to. Becoming a journalist is a privilege not everyone has access to. We live in a world where, as USC Annenberg Dean Willow Bay said, “so many people are shouting to be heard.” Journalists, then, must also learn to listen. They cannot make the public understand a story if they do not first understand it themselves.
But truth will not encourage progressive activism if readers cannot tell whether or not that truth is, well, true. Now more than ever, journalists must work for the public’s trust. Much of the difference between advocacy journalism and propaganda lies in transparency, which entails not only informing readers of where and how they got information, but also remaining accountable when that information isn’t correct. Being an active, responsible journalist means confronting faults and inherent biases and overcoming them with the public’s best interests in mind. It also means encouraging an active, responsible readership — one that checks the facts and ethics behind articles and contributes to discussions in the comments sections. 
As our world continues to evolve and as perspectives continue to diversify, the platforms communicating that diversity will shift as well. Indeed, it goes without saying that our society — the values and ideas that constitute the modern zeitgeist — is changing at an unprecedented pace. But we need to realize that journalists, too, will be a part of that change. They always have.

After 15 far-too-long weeks, it’s summer. Time to relax, to reconnect and recharge, to start those summer jobs and finally enjoy the sunshine. Summer is supposed to be a relaxing time, filled with lazy days in the sun, hammocks and barbecues — but for many young people, it is a time fraught with anxiety. 
As temperatures climb and hangout spots shift from living rooms and bars to beaches and pools, there is intense pressure to wear less clothing and unveil the “beach bodies” we’ve all supposedly been working on since January. And for those of us who have been chained to textbooks and email inboxes all spring, that can be a very scary prospect. But the beach body ideal is ridiculous: Body size and body image should not hold anyone back from enjoying summer activities.
The idea of a beach body is a modern, manufactured one. Swimming and going to the beach became recreational activities in the mid 1800s, coinciding with the beginnings of advertising and mass media. Early swimmers wore full-coverage dresses and suits to the beach, but over the decades, swim wear became less modest for both genders. Bikinis and swim trunks were introduced in the 1950s and were advertised by models, actors and athletes as symbols of an ideal, luxurious lifestyle. As these skin-baring styles became the norm, businesses capitalized on consumers’ insecurities, selling weight loss products, tanning creams and gym memberships to “get ready for summer.”
But the idealization of a specific body type — or the notion that people need  to be working toward a certain body type — in order to enjoy summer activities is, quite simply, idiotic. People of all sizes and abilities should be able to embrace their  bodies; suggesting that there is a proper body size for the beach or pool is just another example of the biases and stigma that have permeated throughout our culture.
The people who promote the beach body ideal — many of whom are making money from the products supposedly necessary for a bodily transformation — often say that by promoting weight loss, they are advocating for health and telling Americans to use their summer body as a kickstarter toward a balanced lifestyle. But it’s not that simple, and the shame-based tactics these companies use have damaging effects on mental and physical health. 
America’s warped body ideals are a topic that never seems to leave the cultural conversation. As sedentary lifestyles and processed food continue to affect millions of people, our society is saturated with images of unobtainable bodies Photoshopped to perfection. These images seem to prevent anyone who doesn’t look like a professional model for Nike or Victoria’s Secret from feeling okay with his or her body shape. According to the Yahoo Health’s 2016 Body-Positivity Survey, about 66 percent of American women and 30 percent of American men had a negative or ambivalent view of their bodies.
There is no denying that our country has some serious health issues — our rising rates of diabetes and heart disease are enough to show that — but by making our idea of an acceptable body difficult to obtain and shaming those who do not have it, we may actually be exacerbating these health issues. 
Having a negative or love-hate relationship with one’s body has been proven to discourage healthy behaviors like exercise and healthy eating. For many people, being shamed by peers and the media can often lead to feelings of resignation and unhealthy coping mechanisms, such as substance abuse and comfort eating, or the alternative route of extreme dieting, which can result in eating disorders and other health issues. Body shaming — whether indirect or direct — has dire consequences, and we need to find a more sustainable solution to help people embrace their body shapes while also encouraging them to practice better habits. 
In short, it is not worth it to try to change your body for the summer. Everyone deserves to have fun in whatever body they currently have, and as hard as it is, resisting the ideal of the perfect beach body may be healthier in the long run. Get a swimsuit that fits well and makes you feel good, take care of yourself and go to the pool as much as you like. We’ve worked hard enough this semester, and deserve to enjoy the season without stressing about body size and shape.
