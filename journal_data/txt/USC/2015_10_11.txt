Postmates saves you time by delivering your favorite food right to your door.
College students are always trying to maximize their time. Since academics and extracurricular activities consume a majority of our time as students, being able to do as much as we can as efficiently as possible is crucial so we can enjoy other hobbies, too. Here are some free phone apps that will make you more productive and can really come in handy as a college student.
1. Songkick
If you love going to concerts as much as I do, then Songkick is the ideal app for you. Songkick is a great way for you to track your favorite artists when they’re on tour and search for upcoming concerts in your area. You can customize your preferences by selecting your locations or letting Songkick scan your Apple Music, Spotify and Facebook to suggest artists for you. Songkick shows you who is playing, the venue they will be playing at and the time and date of the performance. Not only does Songkick show who will be playing in the area, but the app also sends you notifications for when concert tickets go on sale, allowing you to forget about spending hours searching online, looking for which concert to go to next.
2. Groupon
As college students, we want to do all these fun, miscellaneous activities — but that can be hard to do on a limited budget. Now, that’s possible thanks to Groupon. Groupon is an app that offers promo codes and discounts for various places in the area. Instead of hunting around the internet for deals, Groupon streamlines the process so that you can decide what activity you want to do, and which promotional deals to take advantage of, in minutes. Some services include dining, fitness and spa visits along with many other amenities. You can save your coupons on your online profile and save them for later or search for more coupons in the app. Exploring L.A. has just gotten a lot easier — and cheaper!
3. Postmates
Forget the tedious calls and busy phone lines, food delivery has been revolutionized now that Postmates is available at the touch of a button for hungry customers. Unlike other local delivery services such as Tapingo and Envoy, Postmates is a 24-hour service that delivers for a wide range of restaurants and stores outside the USC parameter. Their efficiency in delivering food to you in under an hour is unmatched. In addition, Postmates features smart tracking in which you can see the location of your Postmate in real time while he or she is bringing the food to you.
4. Evernote
Evernote is the perfect app for organizing school work. Evernote is a note taking app that allows people to effectively sort their notes and share them with others without closing the app. It also allows you to attach web clips onto the note. Not only is Evernote suitable for individual work, but it can also be used for group projects. Evernote has a chat option where people can simultaneously collaborate on projects and take notes??.
These  free apps are only a few of many apps that can accommodate to your specific interests while increasing productivity. Try them out and see what you think.

College is truly a self-reflecting time, and it goes by much more quickly than we expect it to. When you come to orientation as a freshman, you might be in denial that you will all too soon be a senior, or that you should even listen to all those boring informational sessions. However, here are five things that you should actually pay attention to at orientation and should continue to keep in mind throughout your four years of college:  
1. Your Mental health is a priority
As college students, we tend to romanticize the idea of being busy and overwhelmed and attribute it to simply being a college student. However, your mental health is not just important — it is a priority. You’re not a bad person for taking breaks from work and your social life to take care of yourself. If you ignore the warning signals your body is sending you now, it will turn into a habit later in life. Put yourself first. If you’re in need of an outside support system, the USC Engemann Student Health Center offers individual student counseling and group counseling.
2. Time management = life management
Try not to fall for the seduction of procrastination. Though an assignment may not be due for another week, when you have other commitments as well you’ll realize how important it is to be ahead of the curve. While you may have the ability to finish assignments the night before, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should. At the very least, you should be brainstorming by the time it is assigned, as this can give you the necessary time to change ideas and get advice from classmates and professors. For advice on time and stress management, pay a visit to the USC Kortschak Center for Learning and Creativity on the third floor of the Student Union.
3. Office hours don’t have to be awkward
Most people reserve office hours for the times when they need to argue against a grade, but office hours should be used prevent this situation in the first place. Not all professors seem approachable, but if office hours are listed and are not “by appointment only,” I encourage you to attend. Whether it’s one question or one hundred questions, they are yielding themselves as a resource to you. It can also come in handy later if you’re interested in being a TA or need a recommendation letter. Office hours not only help in class, but it demonstrates the type of student you are. Be a good student!
4. Your RA is your friend
The residential assistants are more than just the people who send out emails on your floor. They are, in fact, students who decided to volunteer their time and energy to helping other college students have a memorable experience. They are trained in everything they do, so they are a great source of help — especially for issues that run deep with emotion. Sometimes you just need to talk to someone without judgment, which is one of the many things RA’s can provide. Establish a relationship with your RA and be sure to attend some of the events they host. They usually have free food, too.
5. You are the only one who can measure your success
On a prestigious campus like USC, it’s basically a battlefield of competition for internships and jobs. It’s important to not be discouraged by everyone else’s success. Instead, focus on the things you want to do, and how you are going to achieve those goals. There is no foolproof path to success, but mimicking others surely isn’t the way. The only person in charge of your life is you even if it feels like employers are holding the reigns. You’ll find that success is often a measure of satisfaction more than anything else.

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, the Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research hosted “Singing in the Lion’s Mouth: Music as Resistance to Genocide,” a two-day series of events on Saturday and Sunday that examined the role of music in resisting violence and raising awareness.
The event was put on in collaboration with the Thornton School of Music and sponsored by Visions and Voices.
Two documentaries were screened over the weekend: Screamers, which illustrates how the rock band System of a Down spread awareness about the Armenian Genocide through their music, and Following the Ninth: In the Footsteps of Beethoven’s Final Symphony, which reveals how Beethoven’s “Ode to Joy” has been used to resist 20th century dictatorships.
The screenings were held in the Ray Stark Family Theatre in the School of Cinematic Arts.
A panel featuring filmmaker Carla Garapedian was held following Screamers and a discussion with director Kerry Candaele was held after Following the Ninth.
“Music is one of the arts that is the most emotional … and it can directly affect people,” Professor Wolf Gruner, director of the Shoah Foundation, said. “People turn to music as a coping mechanism when they suffer the most extreme violence and persecution because it helps reassure [their] own mental and emotional health, connects [them] to other people and [helps them] find strength to resist mass violence.”
On the second day, speakers from the University of Cape Town in South Africa and Universitas Padjadjaran in Indonesia, as well as guests from the University of Colorado at Boulder, Columbia University and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum discussed how music has been utilized to resist violence during the Holocaust and the Armenian and Indonesian genocides.
Following the symposium, Thornton students performed a concert in the Alfred Newman Recital Hall that featured pieces used as instruments of resistance during the Holocaust and other genocides.
“People think of [music] as entertainment, [but] we have statements from survivors who have said things like ‘music was life, music was more important than food,’” said Nick Strimple, a professor at the Thornton School and an expert on Jewish music. “It’s a very interesting concept because we don’t have a frame of reference in our own lives for what they were going through and how important the activities of daily life that we take for granted were for them.”
Twelve Thornton Chamber singers performed Pierre De Geyter and Eugene Pottier’s left-wing anthem “The Internationale,” as well as Hermann Leopoldi’s and Fritz Löhner-Beda’s “Buchenwaldlied.” These pieces were performed simultaneously much like they were in the Buchenwald concentration camp to drown out the chanting of Communist prisoners.
In an instrumental performance, Daniel Newman-Lessler, a pianist and graduate student at the Thornton School, performed “Two Polonaises,” a piece from a manuscript discovered in the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp in 1944 by an inmate.
“Music is an equal playing field. A good piece of music is big enough to fit anyone with different … life experiences,” Newman-Lessler said. “People talk about music as a universal language and one that transcends cultural barriers. I think this is very much true [because music] can convey various problems and emotions.”

Monday Night Dinner is a weekly tradition between IFC fraternities and Panhellenic sororities During MND, everyone wears cute dresses or skirts with nice blouses and eats dinner together in the house. Each sorority visits all of the fraternities to make deliveries of candy, snacks and other small gifts to members of the houses and the boys do the same for the sororities. Picking out outfits each week for these dinners can be a little stressful, but hopefully this post will inspire you and make your outfit picking a little bit easier.
1. Neutral with a pop of color
One of my favorite ways to dress is wearing neutrals with a few pops of color. For this outfit, all you need is a simple dark colored t-shirt dress, a pair of neutral heels and some colorful accessories like a purse or jewelry. I chose to keep the color the same with the necklace and bag, but it isn’t necessary if you’d rather show off a few different colors. Layering a long necklace with an otherwise plain dress elongates your torso, creating the illusion that you’re a little bit taller than you actually are and making the outfit a lot more flattering. You could also opt for a brightly colored lip when doing your makeup and curl your hair to really step up the outfit.

2. Patterned Sundress
Even though it’s officially fall, in sunny Southern California it doesn’t really get cold enough to ditch sundresses until November at the earliest. A cute patterned sundress is perfect for Monday Night Dinner — slightly dressy, but not over the top. Pair it with neutral sandals (or heels if that’s your thing), throw on a metallic crossbody or clutch, and you are good to go. If you’re not in too big of a hurry to get to the Row after class, you could either straighten or curl your hair and apply simple makeup to match the “not overdone” aesthetic that this outfit conveys.

3. Sleeves for cold weather
Once it starts cooling down, sleeved dresses will be more acceptable and probably a lot more desirable. It may be winter at this point, but I can never turn down an adorable white dress and brightly colored clutch. As Lilly Pulitzer once said,  “Not always sunny, but always in a sunny state of mind!” In Southern California I’m pretty sure we stay in a sunny state of mind all year long — unless there’s rain. When it rains, nobody leaves the protection of his or her house. Whether you opt for a white dress or one in a darker color, you can never go wrong with metallic sandals, flats or heels. You can straighten or curl your hair with this dress, but a neat high ponytail is definitely acceptable with this outfit as well.

4. Patterned skirt with a simple blouse
For days when putting on a dress is just out of the question, opting for a more business casual outfit is totally acceptable. Wearing a skirt that’s patterned rather than a solid color, elevates the outfit, making it look dressier while still letting you feel casual. Pairing the outfit with metallic accessories allows the focus of the outfit to be the pattern on the skirt. This steps the outfit up even one notch higher. You could straighten or curl your hair depending on your mood, but I’d recommend wearing a lipstick that matches one of the colors in the skirt to tie it all together.

USC faced off against UCLA Friday and Saturday night in two parliamentary-style debates, which covered the war in Syria and U.S. immigration policy. The first debate, which had competitors debate the U.S. backing of Syrian rebel groups, ended in victory for the USC team.
The event was followed by a multi-school roundtable debate on Saturday, which set teams from USC and La Verne University against UCLA and Pepperdine. The debate, over the costs and benefits of building a wall across the United States’ southern border, ultimately went in UCLA and Pepperdine’s favor.
The debate took place at Politicon, a nonpartisan political convention at the Los Angeles Convention Center that hosted political commentators, comics and politicians including Newt Gingrich, David Axelrod, James Carville and Trevor Noah.
The event took place over two days and featured multiple panels, movie screenings and musical performances, all with the goal of creating “a platform for media of all types to present their own events,” according to its website.
Friday’s debate had a USC team of senior business administration major Ideen Saiedian and first-year law student Nathaniel Haas, who affirmed the resolution that the U.S. should remove its backing from any rebel groups in the Syrian civil war.
USC’s strategy centered around denouncing the unpredictable nature and unintended consequences of U.S. support for rebels, citing the rise of ISIS and the ineffective influence of the U.S. program in Syria so far.
“When was the last time the United States successfully supported a rebel group in a civil war that led to the successful transition to democracy?” Haas asked. “It wasn’t even a civil war — it was World War II, where we had to drop nuclear bombs and rewrite a nation’s constitution in order for it to work.”
UCLA’s response emphasized the instability and human rights abuses of the current Assad regime, arguing that the only way to create peace in the region was to arm rebel groups that would fight back against the long-standing dictatorship.
Ultimately, judges handed the debate to USC, citing the “unanswered questions raised from the USC side” as the deciding factor, according to judge Steven Olikara.
Saiedian, a member of USC’s policy debate team, credited his and Haas’s success to the long hours of preparation that went into researching the Syrian conflict. Though they only found out the topic a few days before the debate, it happened to be the same topic the policy team had been preparing for since summer. According to Saiedian, this preparation involved 30 hours per week of research and tournaments every two to three weeks, such as last week’s tournament in Kentucky, in which USC placed in the top 35 teams.
Saturday’s debate had a different format, with teams from two schools partnering up to debate whether a border wall would be a cost-effective way of significantly reducing illegal immigration.
The USC team, consisting of sophomore economics and mathematics  major Kristoff Weakely and freshman economics and sociology major Rebecca Harbeck, argued against the resolution, warning that the wall would not stop illegal immigration, and instead would marginalize immigrants and create a less accepting environment in the U.S.
The opposing side, which supported building a wall, cited the success of cities such as San Diego in reducing illegal immigration, and ultimately won the debate due to the convincing nature of their economic argument, according to the judges.
Though Weakely and Harbeck faced a setback, they plan to continue competing throughout the upcoming school year. Both members of the policy debate team found it difficult to transition into the parliamentary-style debate, which involves a different speaking order and more participants; however, they ultimately believed that their efforts paid off.
“It was very confusing, but I feel like we made the thesis of our arguments clear and did the best we could,” Weakely said.

USC students, Los Angeles residents, city officials, USC administration and the Los Angeles Fire Department gathered Saturday morning to celebrate the grand opening of Fire Station No. 15. The ceremony, held at the new fire station, highlighted the partnership between LAFD and USC, which funded the construction of the new facility.
“I’d like to thank USC, not only for paving the way for this beautiful new station, but for your hard work each week in putting this together,” LAFD Assistant Chief Ronnie Villanueva said. “We met every other week for months on this program, and without everyone’s help, this could not have happened.”
The reception featured speeches by President C. L. Max Nikias, District 9 Councilmember Curren D. Price Jr., Chief Deputy City Engineer Deborah Weintraub and LAFD Fire Chief Ralph M. Terrazas, as well as a commemorative presentation by LAFD Battalion Chief Curt Klafta and a performance by the USC marching band. The event culminated in a ribbon cutting ceremony, after which guests were able to take a tour of the fire station.
Nikias emphasized the importance of the work done by LAFD firefighters.
“The strength of any city rises from the passions, hopes and dreams of the people who call it home,” Nikias said. “Those passions, hopes and dreams can only thrive with the peace of mind, with the feeling of safety and security and with the protection of life and property.”
Fire Station No. 15, now located at the intersection of Hoover Street and 30th Street, was originally located on Jefferson Boulevard. Terrazas discussed the reason for the move and spoke about the new fire station’s potential.
“By trading the property, and them building us this fire station, it allowed the Village to expand into one contiguous piece of property,” Terrazas said. “I think it was a great arrangement for both sides. The fire department gets a brand-new fire station, and we needed a bigger station to house all the resources — all the ambulances and fire trucks — that we could not fit in the old station.”
In addition to increased space, Terrazas also cited modern sustainability upgrades, efficiency and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act as ways that the new fire station has improved upon the old one.
Though most of the old fire station will be demolished to make room for a pedestrian walkway, the front of the old building has been moved and will now be repurposed as a production studio for the School of Cinematic Arts.
“The men and women of the Los Angeles Fire Department faithfully served the USC campus and the community for over 65 years,” Terrazas said. “I’m very happy to hear that at least part of old Fire Station 15 has been moved to a new location and will continue to serve in the community as part of the USC Robert Zemeckis Center for Digital Arts.”

The Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in collaboration with MediaShift  — a virtual media company and online magazine that covers how traditional media is changing due to technologies like podcasting, blogs and social media — organized a women’s hackathon over the weekend in Wallis Annenberg Hall to provide opportunities and spaces for women to turn their ideas into viable businesses.
The winner of the hackathon was the team with the idea for Habitat, an environmental news startup that uses virtual reality storytelling. Honorable mention was given to LikelyMedia, which would use virtual reality and real data to make projections about the future and VRacity Media, which would provide virtual reality journalism content via a subscription service and supported by sponsored content.
“It’s really important for journalists to explore this area because it’s growing so rapidly; it’s a very powerful form of storytelling,” said Amara Aguilar, assistant professor of professional practice in digital journalism at USC Annenberg and one of the judges of the hackathon. “It’s especially important for women to be involved in this industry because women are greatly underrepresented in these industries, and we really need that diversity to lead and to tell powerful stories.”
Publisher and founder of MediaShift Mark Glaser said Hack the Gender Gap came from West Virginia Reed College of Media, one of the sponsors of the event. Glaser worked with school to host a similar hackathon in October 2014. Glaser said he visited USC last January and discussed the possibility of hosting a hackathon at USC with Willow Bay, director of the school of journalism.
“The idea is how can we give women and students a chance and space that they might not get and feel empowered to be in teams, creating things on their own, and having great support network,” he said. “The goal has always been [to] get women to do what they might not be able to do under circumstances and [to] give them a unique experience they wouldn’t get otherwise especially in schools where they don’t have things like this.”
The hackathon, attended by 75 students and participants and 15 mentors from the fields of technology, marketing and media who served as facilitators, started Friday night with a panel discussion.
The talk hosted female technology and business leaders that focused on how women in technology and media are achieving success, breaking down barriers and making a difference.
The panel included Sara Christenson from the investment company Raptor Group; Alex Schaffert, managing director of digital strategy and innovation at KPCC: Carrie Southworth, cofounder of Twigtale, a platform for personalized children’s books; Potsie Rivera, former UI UX designer for dating app Grindr; and Jennifer de la Fuente, web designer and Annenberg adjunct professor.
Bay, the moderator of the panel asked the panelists, “Is tech a boys’ club?” Schaffert answered.
“The world is a boys’ club. But change is around the corner. There are free coding classes in libraries in Los Angeles. Girls are already going to the libraries,” she said. “We just have to make sure that these skills are available [and accessible] in public spaces.”
Bay added that women are heavy users of social media and the key audience in that marketplace, yet companies are not hiring the majority of their user base.
“That’s what our research has shown as well — the majority of users of social media are women,” said Jean Truelson, Annenberg alumna, CEO and founder of the San Francisco-based company Dogpatch and a mentor for the hackathon. “For me as founder, I want to be able to build enough of that space and support in social media. I know the majority of my potential users are women. I’m here to support them because I want to be able to hire them later, or support their company and future startups that are going to get out of this group.”
Truelson said the best advice for women interested in entrepreneurship is to get started.
“Don’t get too stuck in just doing research, or ‘I need more education,’” she said. “You can go and get an MBA if you want to work for a major company but if you want to learn how to start a company. Start a company. That’s when you really learn everything you need to do and make all the mistakes — it’s truly a good job training. If you have an idea, and you’re truly passionate about it, go and do it.”
Students who attended this hackathon echoed this enthusiasm and interest. After the opening panel, the students formed teams to come up with startup ideas utilizing immersive journalism and virtual reality.
“I like the opportunity to collaborate, and it’s an interesting environment where folks from across the country, with different skill sets, different years as well as experience, just to be able to work together and collaborate on a project is a really interesting proposition,” Monica Castillo, a graduate student in journalism said. “I don’t know much about [virtual reality], and I learned a lot already so far, whatever its limitations, whatever we can make [out of] it. This is kinda like a classroom.”
Jordyn Holman, a senior majoring in print and digital journalism and a columnist for the Daily Trojan, said the hackathon challenged her team to think outside of the box because virtual reality is so different from traditional print and digital journalism.
“Technology is the future,” she said. “You need to get these technical skills, but conferences like this shows you exactly what skills you need and exactly how they can be used for reporting specifically [with] virtual reality — which takes people right there — that’s kinda the whole point of journalism, to make people understand. Virtual reality is the biggest gift in making people understand what’s happening.”

No show · Athletic Director Pat Haden asked Steve Sarkisian to take a leave of absence for an undisclosed reason after the coach missed Sunday’s practice. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton will be the interim head coach for now. – Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
If the USC football program wants to win national championships, then Steve Sarkisian cannot be the head coach. I originally wrote this column before the news broke that Sark is taking a forced leave of absence, but the fact that he is further substantiates the fact that he should not be on the sidelines representing USC at any more games.
It’s tough to call for someone’s job, especially a guy like Sark who seems to be well-liked and appreciated by his players and staff. There also seem to be elements at play that are much greater and more important than football. If Sark is dealing with issues, I hope he gets the help he needs and is able to get his life back on track.
Unfortunately as callous as it is to say, dealing with off-the-field issues as a head coach is not conducive to success. Additionally, being nice and fun aren’t exactly the requisite traits one looks for in a potentially dynastic head, coach. This team, like last years, is undisciplined and unfocused, which is most likely a direct manifestation of the coaching staff’s lackadaisical approach to certain facets of the game.
The way Sark coached the Washington game combined with his leave of absence serves as an affirmation of his inability to steward the Trojans’ program back toward relevancy and greatness.
Many things in college football are complex. There are nuances and subtleties to amateurism, student athlete compensation and the widening schism between ground and pound football and aerial spread attacks. One of the few black-and-white issues that remains in college football is winning, and what it takes to have a stalwart program. There are no shades of gray when it comes to victories; a team needs a championship caliber coach. At this point, it is abundantly clear that Sark just doesn’t fit that model.
The best coaches are widely revered CEO-type figures on the weekdays and shrewd tacticians on gameday. Sark is unfortunately neither. It’d be one thing if he embarrassed USC with his drunken antics, and then put together blowout victories on a weekly basis. Instead, outside of recruiting, the only time USC makes the news under Sark is from an upset loss or a scandal that has nothing to do with the             on-the-field product. That is simply unacceptable.
The fact that the same players are committing the same penalties and making the same mistakes against Washington that that they made against Arkansas State is mind boggling and inexcusable. A top-flight coaching staff addresses and corrects these mistakes, or finds players who are intelligent and disciplined enough to not commit drive- and                game- killing penalties. Instead, Sark and co. have let these continue unabated, occasionally blowing up on the sideline at the most egregious of all fouls.
The issue with penalties isn’t what ails the Trojans. It is just a symptom of the more pervasive problem with the program: the fact that the team lacks an elite leader. Again, these conclusions don’t just come from the Washington game, as woeful as that may have been. One could, and many have, fill up entire columns chronicling the ineptitude that took place at the Coliseum on Thursday night.
It’s more than just those things. Not blitzing the life out of a true freshman QB starting on the road, forcing passes to the sidelines, refusing to just run the ball when it worked so well are all decisions that are emblematic of a coaching staff that shouldn’t be at the helm of any team with championship aspirations.
Many Sark apologists will point to sanctions or his admittedly tremendous recruiting talents as reasons for him to stay. However, sanctions aren’t the reason Sark gets outcoached four or five times per year. As for recruiting, USC recruits USC. Lane Kiffin, Pete Carroll and even Paul Hackett, who brought in both Matt Leinart and Carson Palmer, attracted great talent. It doesn’t matter how many five-star recruits you get to commit if you can’t beat inferior talent because of poor coaching.
My hope was that Sark’s recruiting prowess would compensate for his inadequacies as an actual head coach. Apparently, I was misguided in this hope. I expected the team to lose when they faced off against equally talented teams, due to a coaching disadvantage. What I didn’t foresee was USC also losing to teams that they should beat by four touchdowns. Every team has letdowns, but Saban and Meyer limit those to once or twice a year and still sometimes find a way to win. Sark’s teams have letdowns every other week it seems.
One of the most striking comments from Sark on Thursday was that fans needed to get used to close games in the deep and talented Pac-12. I think I speak for most reasonable fans when I say that we would all be fine with close games, if we won them more than we lost. Outside of Stanford’s woeful performance and the Arizona kicker’s missed chip shot field goal last season, USC hasn’t won a close game against a quality opponent under Sark. It’s the height of insanity to basically tell fans to expect some losses, when Sark has the resources and talent he has at his disposal.
USC needs a coach who wins these close games, but also who combines USC’s significant talent advantage with his own significant abilities to once again be a prominent national contender, not a preseason prediction that fell by the wayside.
Not all of the blame lies with Sark however. Some of it lies with Athletic Director Pat Haden as well. While he has certainly cleaned up the Athletic Department and made strides in other sports, football and basketball have underperformed under his tenure. It’s great to win championships in water polo and have a high APR, but fans, and the boosters who fund a lot of these programs, care about only one percentage and that is how many wins vs. how many losses the Trojan football team has.
Trojan fans expect excellence, and Sark isn’t excellent. It may only be a year and a half into his tenure, but at this point he is a sunk cost. A clean break from Sark is what the Trojan football program needs in order to be relevant again. They should be in the news for winning games and not for the possibility that the team is led by a coach battling substance abuse issues.
There is nothing I want more than to be proven wrong about this. If Sark is able to get healthy and turn his life around, and then somehow lead the Trojans back into the upper echelon of college football programs, I will be the first to congratulate him and cheer him on. Most USC fans and supporters just want what is best for Sark as a human being and for the program; there is no other agenda.
Unfortunately, that seems like a pipe dream at this point. Sark just does not seem to be the guy to transform the Trojans back into a championship contender, more likely, he is the guy who will keep them mired in mediocrity. With the leave of absence, it might take a while to find out, if ever, but hopefully this disastrous situation ends well for both Sark and the USC program. Sometimes relationships don’t work out, and I hope someone in charge can be mature and rational and end this ill-fated hire before the USC program is irreparably damaged.

Well, sadly, you thoughtfully hit all the key points. A change is certainly in order and I cringe at what the fallout of all this will be. To go from the (mostly) glory years under John McKay, John Robinson, and Pete Carrol is very hard to take. Yes, being a head football coach at USC, or any high-profile college, is a high pressure job that only a few can command successfully. Sark is gone and we all wish him well and godspeed both with his personal battles and whatever career he can resurrect. The questions remain about whom to replace him with, should Haden go, and how quickly can the Trojans rebound and gain respect and field success? Hindsight is always easy, of course, and Sark should not have been hired in the first place. It is also a reminder that Orgeron should have been given an opportunity, if no one else. The football team will eventually resurrect itself but it may be another long two or three years before that begins, and perhaps all of the travesty in the past few years will be a blessing in disguise, both at USC and college football in general. I think the only way to let this healing process begin is with the team itself – play clean, intelligent, hard football, get some important wins in the rest of the season, and hold your heads high even at the lowest times.

Just keep winning · Junior Blake Edwards (pictured) and sophomore Grant Stein accounted for 80 percent of USC’s goals against Santa Barbara. – Kyleen Hengelhaupt | Daily Trojan
The No. 2 Trojan water polo team went undefeated in the SoCal Invitational and has advanced to the championship game where they will face No. 1 UCLA Sunday evening. The Trojans are looking to capture their fourth straight SoCal championship.
USC defeated Stanford 9-6 in the semifinals to advance to the finals.
USC jumped out to a 3-1 lead in the first quarter and never looked back, extending the lead to 5-1 by halftime. By the fourth period, the Trojans had a 7-4 lead.
Junior Blake Edwards continued his dominating weekend as the Trojans leading scorer with another four goals. Chase Koplow, Lachlan Edwards, Matteo Morelli, James Walters and Mihajlo Milicevic each scored an additional goal for the Trojans.
Goalkeeper McQuin Baron had another strong day in goal for USC with seven saves on the day, four of them coming in the opening quarter of the match.
The Trojans opened the tournament with a dominant 17-3 win over San Jose State Saturday afternoon. The Trojans took an 10-0 lead into halftime after a big second period in which they scored eight unanswered goals.
Junior Blake Edwards netted a hat trick in just the second period. Redshirt freshman Chase Koplow and redshirt sophomore Mitch Embrey each also tallied hat tricks over the course of the game. Sophomore Lachlan Edwards also netted two goals in the second period.
The Trojans also had additional goals from five other players: James Walters, Matteo Morelli and Nick Lavayen.
Baron only played for the first half of the game, but kept the Spartans scoreless, not allowing a goal.
As the afternoon rolled around, the Trojans went up against No. 6 UC Santa Barbara defeating them 10-8.
USC opened the game with a 4-1 first quarter and was able to hold off every attempt by UCSB to cut the game to one goal.
Two Trojans netted four goals a piece. Blake Edwards and sophomore Grant Stein counted for 80 percent of the Trojans scoring in the game. The other two goals came from Lachlan Edwards and Bryce Hoerman.
Baron stood tall in the goal for the Trojans once again with 11 saves in the game.
The win propelled the Trojans to the semifinal match on Sunday afternoon against Pac-12 rivals Stanford where they won, 9-6.
The Trojans faced off against crosstown rivals UCLA in the championship match on Suday evening, but results were unavailable at press time. A recap of the match can be found online.

The men’s tennis team’s play at the Saint Francis Health System ITA All-American Championships came to a close on Saturday when junior Nick Crystal lost in the Round of 16. Crystal, who is ranked No. 42 in the nation, was the final Trojan competing in the tournament in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Crystal pulled off back-to-back upsets to reach the Round of 16, including an upset in the Round of 32 against Kentucky’s Beck Pennington 6-4, 6-2. In the Round of 16, Crystal faced Ohio State’s Hugo de Feo, who defeated Crystal 6-3, 7-6 to end Crystal and USC’s play in the tournament.
Senior Max de Vroome also had a good showing at the event before being eliminated in the Round of 32. De Vroome entered the match with a four-match win streak, earning him the No. 61 spot in the country. His streak was snapped, however, by No. 22 Andre Goransson, 7-5, 6-2.
Crystal and the Trojans will return to action on Oct. 15 at the USTA/ITA Southwest Regional Championships in Malibu.
This appears to be a very down year for the tennis team. No genuine leader to rally around. Don’t understand why Coach Smith has not recruited well the last couple of years after the program reached the highest level nationally?

Generally in music, the word “genre” narrowly isolates styles of music into very distinct categories. Conversely, an interesting. yet under-recognized, aspect of EDM is that “electronic” is not really a holistic term for the genre. In fact, most EDM artists and producers would argue that their music fits into a plethora of different genres far outside the term “electronic.”
My first run-in with this aspect of EDM was actually after my first year at Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas. A few weeks after I came home, Insomniac sent me an email survey to fill out to be entered into a drawing for tickets for next year’s EDC Las Vegas. I thought filling out a survey would just take a few minutes, so I went ahead entering my input on the experience.
Toward the end of the survey, there was a section that asked what my favorite “genre” was and requested I mark all that applied. I sat staring at the page and the enormously long list of things I had never really heard of, including “hardcore,” “garage,” “acid house” and “underground house trippy.” In my naïveté, I actually did an online search of my favorite artists to find out what genre they identified with.
This started a whole new era of my EDM appreciation as a world of very diverse sub-genres all identifying under one word, “electronic.” In fact, I came to understand that the initial word “electronic” was not actually how many artists understood themselves. This term merely was a representation of the mode in which they produced music — through technology and the innovations in synthesizers rather than live instruments.
Listening to the radio became a new experience for me. I started to hear terms like “techno,” “trap” and “dubstep,” but it took a very long time training my ear to understand the actual legitimate musical differences between them.
In fact, most common listeners wouldn’t be able to tell the difference. Techno and house music are almost one in the same, but with roots from Detroit and Chicago, respectively. Using many of the same instruments and a plethora of synthesizers, these two genres, though almost indiscernible, create significant argument within the industry about their respective properties.
“House” has several variations within itself, such as “deep house,” “acid house” and “progressive house.” I remember thinking that this was so bizarre even on my first trip to The Ministry of Sound in London, England. Though I went to see the DJ Kaskade,  a self-proclaimed deep and progressive house producer, the club had several other rooms dedicated to more EDM.
This multi-genre sensory overload is a defining point in the world of EDM. There are many DJs who very narrowly identify with one genre, something they have strayed very little from. There are also others who are somewhat all over the place in terms of their electronic sub-genre identities: for example, Diplo, who has dabbled in dubstep, trap, tropical house and post-hardcore.
Not only are the existing number of sub-genres limitless, but the future of EDM is also defined by the continuous addition of these classifications that seem to spring out of thin air. I was just listening to the BPM satellite radio station the other day and the Chainsmokers’ YouTube EDM 15 was on. I was engaged because I personally love their radio spot, as they tend to talk an extensive amount about the industry between their songs. In fact, they brought up the emergence of tropical house and a new wave of New York garage that was hitting the club scene again.
With all these sub-genres, it is fascinating to watch the positive and negative effects on the industry from such diversity. For one, there are ardent fans who can become very personally invested in a specific type of sub-genre, identifying solely with that realm. In this respect, not only is it limiting for the fan base, but it is also limiting for the artist or DJ themselves. Such a pigeon-holed artistic existence can create incredibly stressful limits on an artist who can sometimes corner themselves into a sub-genre, thus failing to evolve. The inability to branch out and reinvent oneself is the greatest downfall of any artist. This world of hundreds of electronic sub-genres can tend to narrow an artist’s avenues.
On the other hand, this concept of so much diversity within one overarching umbrella genre is something that enhances my opinion that EDM is the music of the future. Its ability to constantly absorb diversity and produce new waves and revivals of old and new styles can continually bring in fans. This diversity, artistic creativity and unique take on the genre as a whole is something that continues to define the EDM industry as one of innovation.

On Oct. 10, the ninth annual “Faith and Hope: Beyond Prison Walls” art show took place in Downtown at Homeboy Industries, one of the largest gang intervention, rehabilitation and re-entry programs in the country. The program has been providing job training and therapeutic services for previously incarcerated men and women for the last 26 years. On Saturday, however, their space was transformed into a gallery with artwork from former and currently incarcerated artists.
The event was hosted by the Partnership for Re-Entry Program, a nonprofit organization that seeks ways of improving the successful reintegration of parolees back into the community. Before being released, former inmates are provided with a self-improvement modular correspondence course. Each year, PREP puts on an art show featuring not only a general viewing, but also a silent auction, a live auction and a raffle. During the live auction, there is a reading of poems, biographies and letters written by the artists. The art within the gallery ranged from crafts to paintings and jewelry, emphasizing the array of art programs within the prison complexes.
Though  none of the artists featured in this year’s show were present at the event, many representatives from PREP were on the floor interacting with the viewers and giving more information on the purpose of the art show. Lucy Copp, a volunteer for PREP and a USC alumna, began working with the organization after attending last year’s art show when she moved to Los Angeles to begin her master’s degree. Her duties with PREP include reading letters from inmates, looking for transitional housing upon completion of a re-entry program and writing official letters of approval to the parole board, which grants the inmates permission to move into the transitional housing.
“When lifers, or people who are sentenced to life, receive parole to re-enter society, they have to do six months of transitional housing first, which means they can’t go directly home but have to live amongst other former inmates,” Copp said.
Without a letter of approval, these men and women cannot move out of their institutions, regardless of good conduct or re-entry programs they have participated in, so PREP has been proactive in aiding this process for inmates. Sister Mary Sean Hodges has been a pivotal force behind the organization, as she works directly with men and women at the prisons to prepare them for facing the parole board. Upon arrival, she had her hands full with every part of the exhibit and made herself available to anyone who needed assistance.
“I think [Hodges] just realized that there’s so many prisons with art programs with people doing incredible work,” Copp said. “So, why not have them send the artwork out and have people see it?”
The location of the show may have been small, but it was clear that this movement had made an impact inside and outside of the institutions. One of the volunteers for PREP is a former inmate named Gary Thomas, who now serves as the assistant director alongside Hodges. Thomas began volunteering at PREP when he was released from prison last year. Hodges was a large influence in his involvement, as she visited him in prison. Thomas knew many of the artists and people depicted in the art personally from when he was incarcerated — some for more than 30 years. His support for this artwork comes from a particular experience of knowing these men who he says live the remainder of their lives based on one mistake.
“Most of the art that you see comes from the people who have never done anything like this before in their life until they got to prison,” Thomas said. “They have tremendous talent inside because [they] learn about themselves from the inside out.”
Thomas expressed his connection to the show as a chance for people to see these artists as something outside of an act they may have committed years ago. He recounted stories of friends who have been eligible for parole but chose not to leave prison because of the media depictions of prisoners and the inability to break out of this image. Since working with PREP, the letters of support that he has written with Hodges for transitional housing have helped more than 100 inmates get released and maintain a clear record.
“If a man has done the work to learn and to better himself while he has been down, who am I to deny him help? My job is to help people,” Thomas said.
With events like the Faith and Hope art show, the volunteers of PREP sought to remove the stigma around re-entry for former inmates and create a more accepting and positive environment for people looking to make a change in their lives. As Thomas said, “Don’t judge me by my past. I don’t live there anymore.”

In June, the University revoked its monthly $30 stipend to employees who purchase transit passes. To compensate for the subsidy cut, USC is offering three free parking passes per month for the University Park Campus only. In the absence of a concrete transit support system, the University should instead give all employees the option to rent out housing units owned by the University.
This new development comes at a time when the University is facing massive construction projects, including the establishment of the new University Village. Because of this, the administration claims there is no longer a budget for transit subsidies, though with USC’s $4 billion-plus endowment, it’s skeptical that the school cannot reallocate funds to better support its employees. But maybe this comes with a silver lining and allows University officials to reevaluate their methods of assistance.
It’s obvious that neither the former program nor the current parking allowance is conducive to the USC employee lifestyle. The monthly stipend didn’t even cover half of the cost of the transit pass, which comes with a $100 price tag. The supplement of parking passes are also futile, as many people rely on the Metro system to get to work. Moreover, for those who do have access to a car, the allowance to park three times in a campus parking garage is a mere drop in the ocean in the face of other transportation fees, such as gas and car maintenance. As the largest private employer in Los Angeles, USC must extend its housing assistance program to beyond the representation of just faculty and staff.
Currently, Los Angeles serves as one of the most unaffordable urban areas in the United States. Since 2012, housing prices in the city have risen 27 percent, a figure due to grow even larger as a result of high demand for property and gentrification. Though USC does acknowledge this housing crisis, the University directs this attention to select personnel of academia and not the housing and hospitality staff.
In March, KQED News followed a day in the life of a Stanford University dining employee, whose cumulative travel time to and from work took six hours. This situation is hardly unique to the Palo Alto area and applies to USC directly. All employees of USC could benefit from housing services by placing them in areas close to campus. Having a free, real estate match program for USC employees explores feasible options for their budgets. These are resources that need to be available to everyone.
With the advent of University Village, another approach the University could take is to transform an off-campus student apartment building into an affordable housing option for USC employees only. As more attractive residential listings are made available for the student population, certain areas might be neglected and are better served as potential housing opportunities for people who actually need them.
Ultimately, students should see USC employees as education partners contributing to the overall community. With employees’ monthly transit budget already slashed, it’s time we take a more immersive approach to help the people who have supported the students for so long.

Danni – are you proposing USC take away housing that might be needed by a student and provide it to employees? The problem with this “solution” is that it assumes employees want to live in the same dorms/apts as students do. It also assumes this is an option the workers want.

The past month just hasn’t been great PR for sustainability at USC. A few weeks ago, a protest by Environmental Core put the University’s lack of renewable energy infrastructure under the microscope. The event reinvigorated students’ requests to bring solar power to campus.
And on Sept. 29, associate professor Lisa Schweitzer began the first of a crusade of blog posts criticizing the University’s elimination of the employee transit subsidy program that gave employees $30 a month for transit passes. Most recently, the University announced that it would replace the program with a parking subsidy for employees on campus. Schweitzer’s response? A giant middle finger GIF, and rightfully so. The transit subsidy program was essential to supporting sustainability on a corporate level, and eliminating it is  unequivocally bad policy. It sets a dangerous precedent and calls for a more comprehensive revisit to the University’s sustainability goals.
According to the University’s facts and figures page, it employs more than 19,000 faculty and staff, making the University the largest private employer in Los Angeles. Removing the subsidized transit pass means that employees now have to pay $100 a month to use public transit to get to USC — compared to a subsidized cost for parking a car. Such a tradeoff means that the University significantly incentivized 17,000 people to use cars to get to campus instead of public transit.
From a sustainability perspective, that’s a big problem. As Schweitzer explains, Transportation Services has no opportunity cost for parking garages — either they use them, or they lose them. And empty parking garages most likely incited the move away from the transit subsidy program to begin with. But better policy would use the space for housing that could produce a return on investment instead of contributing to carbon emissions and pollution — as if Los Angeles didn’t have enough of that already.
From a social justice perspective, the elimination of the subsidy program is an even bigger problem. If recent Justice for Janitors protests and last year’s Fight for 15 protests have taught students — and anyone paying attention — anything, it’s that the University has been quick to cut costs at the expense of their employees while raising historic amounts of money — a projected $6 billion, to be precise. Making the use of public transit so expensive for employees, many of whom are paid minimum wage, demonstrates that the University is out of touch with the needs of these individuals. Access to a car may be impractical for many employees, and removing transit subsidies forces them to fork over the $100 monthly cost just to get to work in the morning. And as Schweitzer points out in her blog post, minimum-wage employees in Los Angeles “exist in a hard whipsaw between housing costs, car ownership costs, transit mobility costs and stagnant wages.”
Moreover, the transit subsidy policy ignores today’s transit climate. Construction on the recent extensions of the Expo Line to Santa Monica and the Gold Line to Foothill demonstrates Los Angeles’s efforts to expand public transit to be more comprehensive and accessible. These expansions, however, come as costs to ride the Metro have risen in recent years. So for the University to revoke transit passes in the wake of improvements to public transit is particularly tone deaf to both the costs of public transit and its increased convenience.
USC should wield its power to be a leader in sustainability instead of putting profits before the good of employees and the students who will inherit the carbon-laden atmosphere long after President C. L. Max Nikias has left office. The University’s sustainability page shows that the Board of Trustees’ Campus Planning Committee last approved sustainability resolutions in 2010. One of them states, “Be it further resolved, that the University maintain active incentive programs to encourage faculty, staff, students and visitors to use transportation modes other than the single passenger automobile.” In light of such a blatant failure to live up to its expectations five years later, it’s time for the University to critically examine whether its policies have met its goals, and perhaps craft new goals to keep sustainability in mind as the University continues to expand. To do so would indicate to students, employees and the surrounding community that the University is now — more than ever — committed to crafting a legacy that will support students for centuries to come.

Monday’s Daily Trojan contained an error. The column stated that employees would receive free parking on campus. Employees will receive subsidized parking. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
The author of this article merely thinks USC decided to cruelly stop providing the $30 stipend. From what I understand, the university made this decision to save over half a million dollars a month at a time when they need to look for all opportunities to save money. So I guess the question remains – hey if USC should continue to pay this stipend, where should USC get the money? Just magically out of unicorns and pixie dust?

Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
USC head coach Steve Sarkisian is taking a leave of absence, Athletic Director Pat Haden announced.
Haden’s announcement came after Sarkisian did not show up for the team’s practice on Sunday.
Haden said that he asked the second-year head coach to take an indefinite leave of absence after determining it was clear to him that Sarkisian was not in the right state of mind.
“It was clear to me that he was unhealthy,” Haden said.
Offensive coordinator Clay Helton, who was at Haden’s side during the press conference, will serve as the team’s interim head coach for the second time during his tenure at USC.
“It’s an honor,” Helton said. “Fortunately or unfortunately, I’ve been in this position before.”
Helton previously coached the Trojans to victory over Fresno State in the Las Vegas Bowl in 2013.
“I’ve spoken to our team and our coaches — they obviously had a great deal of concern for the health of coach Sarkisian,” Haden said. “It was also clear to me the support that Clay has from the team and the staff.”
While it remains unclear what exactly led to the decision to temporarily part ways with Sarkisian, it comes just a few days after the Trojans fell to Sarkisian’s former program, an unranked Washington team, 17-12 at the Coliseum.
USC (3-2, 1-2 Pac-12) went 12-6 under Sarkisian since he took the helm of the program in 2014 and will have to quickly turnaround to face rival and No. 14-ranked Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana, on Saturday.
“We’ve got a big task this week with the Notre Dame game, and Clay will do a great job getting our team ready,” Haden said.
The Trojans will be facing, perhaps, its toughest three-week stretch of the season with three ranked opponents — the Fighting Irish, Utah, and Cal — on the horizon.
Sarkisian’s future with the program, however, remains uncertain.
In August, Sarkisian apologized for inappropriate behavior he exhibited at the annual Salute to Troy event, where he appeared to be inebriated while slurring his words.
The 41-year-old Sarkisian later admitted to mixing an unspecified medication with alcohol and said that he would seek treatment.
Leave of absence?  Why wasn’t Sark simply fired? (Because Pat doesn’t have the ****s to can his hire and friend even in light of the damage it’s doing to the University.)
Now both Sark and Pat should be thanked and booted out onto Figueroa by Nikias. Now, not later. 
There are lots of alumni beating this drum, so let’s get it done before we lose the whole season.
 Now! Now! Now1
i told him after that pep rally fiasco, championship or he’s fired.  now what? is jimmy johnson working?
Finally, someone is echoing what I was saying at his hiring. It seems some people have to go through the failure to come up to speed with those of us who saw Sark at Washington and made the correct assessment, which is,”can not take us to the promise land”. And to think, we lost a really good defensive coordinator over this hire.
The coach was a disaster for USC from the beginning as you have succinctly stated.
