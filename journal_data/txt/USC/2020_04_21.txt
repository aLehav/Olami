Four-year basketball seniors Nick Rakocevic and Jonah Mathews woke up in their Las Vegas hotel room five days after Mathews made the shot that shook Los Angeles: a game-winning 3-pointer against then-conference leader UCLA in front of a home crowd of almost 8,000 and with only one second left in the regular season. 
Mathews, who became USC’s 3-point record holder during that final regular-season game, had no idea that the buzzer-beater would be the final shot he would take in a Trojan uniform.
“I wasn’t thinking that was going to be my last shot,” Mathews said. “I was thinking I have a bigger shot coming.”
After receiving a first-round bye in the Pac-12 Tournament, the USC men’s basketball team was set to play Arizona in the quarterfinals March 12. But on the morning of the game, Mathews woke Rakocevic to watch the Power Five tournaments topple one by one. ACC. Big Ten. 
“Give it 30 minutes,” Rakocevic told Mathews. “They’re about to cancel the Pac-12 Tournament, too.”
Sure enough, five hours before tip-off that day, the Pac-12 announced the suspension of all conference play in response to the coronavirus outbreak. In another four hours, the NCAA would cancel both its men’s and women’s basketball tournaments. 
The announcements shattered the hopes of a USC team carrying momentum into their postseason.
“We were about to go win the Pac-12 Tournament [and] go to the Sweet 16 and the Elite Eight in the NCAA Tournament,” Rakocevic said. “That’s what I feel like everybody believed in. That’s what we were going to do … When I found out [the tournaments were canceled], it was just heartbreaking.” 
A No. 45 NET Ranking practically guaranteed the men’s team a run in the NCAA Tournament, and for the players with dreams to go pro, the tournament was intended as their showcase for scouts. Redshirt senior guard Daniel Utomi transferred from the University of Akron to USC for his last year of eligibility, citing USC as the best place to support his pro basketball aspirations. 
“Everyone wants to play in the NCAA Tournament,” Utomi said. “That’s where a lot of people make their money at … You get a couple of games in the tournament, everybody’s watching. Who knows what happens?” 
The men’s players weren’t the only ones to have their season swept out from underneath them, however. Although a much younger squad, the USC women’s basketball team also boasted its share of standout seniors. While the team had already fallen to UCLA in the quarterfinals of their Pac-12 Tournament, they were poised for a trip to the Women’s National Invitation Tournament in late March — that is, until COVID-19 took its reign over the sports world. 
Like Utomi, Aliyah Jeune, a graduate transfer guard from Morehead State, arrived at USC for her last year of eligibility to further her basketball career.
“[The cancellations] took away an opportunity … for me to showcase my talent more,” Jeune said. “I was hurt, I missed the last five games of the regular season, and then the season got canceled … My dream is going pro. I’m still trying to reach that dream.”
Nevertheless, Jeune said that after receiving her master’s in entrepreneurship and innovation from USC, she doesn’t know if she could benefit from another year of eligibility if the opportunity presented itself. Rakocevic agreed. His college career ended when the NCAA Tournament was canceled during the bus ride back from Las Vegas.
“I played my four years there and I did what I said I was going to do, and it was time for me to go on to my next journey, to the next level,” Rakocevic said. “I’m sad that’s how it went out, especially it being my last year, but it was time to move on after they ended it like that. I knew even if they brought back the eligibility, I still would’ve ended up signing with an agent.” 
As it turns out, Jeune, Rakocevic and the other seniors will not be given the choice to extend their college playing careers. The NCAA voted March 30 to give spring-sport athletes an additional year of eligibility but said their decision would not apply to winter-sport athletes in spite of their shortened postseason.
Since the decision, many of these seniors have been focusing on the next step in their basketball careers. Jeune signed with an agent just last week. Mathews said he is about to sign with an agent and move to an apartment in Santa Monica. Utomi explained that’s all one can do amid the pandemic.
“You sign with an agent, but until this coronavirus stuff goes away, we don’t know,” Utomi said. “Everything is on pause.” 
Despite nationwide gym closures and limited access to facilities, players are expected to keep up with their training if they want a future in the sport.
“[The hardest part has been] not being able to find a basket, not being able to shoot anywhere,” Mathews said. “I haven’t gone this long without working out.”
Yet if there is one thing these seniors can agree they will miss most, it’s their teammates. Jeune said that out of the three collegiate teams she’s played for — Rutgers, Morehead State and USC — the coaching staff at USC nurtured the most family-like atmosphere.  
“I wanted to spend more time with my teammates, even after the season, to get to know them better,” she said.
For Mathews and Rakocevic, who have known each other for more than seven years and roomed together on every road trip, the circumstances were even more jarring. 
“When I committed to [USC], I texted [Rakocevic] for like a month,” Mathews said. “Like ‘Bro, come on, we need you. You have to commit.’ The first day, we just hit it off. For us to reach 1,000 points on the same night [and] be the winningest players, to do it all together was super special. I don’t know a lot of players that can say that.”
Rakocevic, too, reflected on his senior-year experience as though Mathews were standing in the room beside him.
“This last year was different just because it was more weight on me and Jonah’s shoulders,” he said. “We knew that we had a bunch of young guys that we wanted to lead and show them how to win big games.”
As team captain, Mathews had one final piece of advice for his team following the seniors’ premature swan song:
“Knowing I’ll never have a USC practice again, it hurts,” he said. “So I would tell [my team] to take advantage of all the practices, all the things you don’t want to do. Because in the end, you think, ‘I want to do that. I should have done that.’ And that’s something you don’t want.”
“Just enjoy it,” Mathews added. “Because it’s over in the blink of an eye.”

It’s fourth-and-goal from the opponent’s 7-yard line for the Trojans. The score is 27-24, six seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. Head coach Clay Helton, in typical new and improved 2020 Clay Helton fashion, rolls the dice. Kedon Slovis drops back. Under pressure, the sophomore quarterback escapes the pocket, but there’s hardly any room. With the game seemingly lost, sophomore receiver Drake London appears in the back corner of the Coliseum’s east end zone. Slovis finds him, London reels it in. Game over. 
The reaction from the crowd? You could hear a pin drop. 
We seem to be approaching that anticlimactic reality more and more every day as the coronavirus pandemic rumbles along. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director Anthony Fauci said last Wednesday that sports could resume this summer and fall if there are no fans at the stadiums. It’d be an unprecedented reality, one that could dramatically change the way the college football season plays out from coast to coast.
But here’s the thing: It could actually benefit USC. Here’s why.
Let’s divide USC’s 2020 schedule into two categories: The Cakewalks and, for lack of a better mealtime analogy, the Tough Cookies. Let’s examine the former first.
The Cakewalks category is made up of seven out of USC’s 12 regular season games. Those are vs. New Mexico, at Stanford, vs. Arizona State, vs. California, at Arizona, vs. Colorado and at UCLA.
The Cakewalks are the games USC has no business losing. They’re the games in which home field advantage should make absolutely no difference — if the Trojans drop one game, the problems extend way beyond the venue; if they lose two, the entire coaching staff should go. 
USC should go 7-0 at best and 6-1 at worst in these games — and if it’s the latter or anything worse, I don’t want to hear the whole they-would’ve-won-if-it-was-at-the-Coliseum garbage. That shouldn’t matter. As such, ignore the impact of empty stadiums on these seven games.
The Tough Cookies group is where things get interesting. That group comprises: neutral site against Alabama, at Utah, at Oregon, vs. Washington and vs. Notre Dame. 
These are the games that, as hinted by the descriptor, will be USC’s most challenging of the year. I could see the Trojans going 1-4 in that set; I could also see them going 4-1. These are the games in which home field advantage will certainly be a factor, and I wouldn’t be shocked if each game is so close that it’s essentially decided by the atmosphere in the stadium. 
Start with the first of those games. The Trojans and Crimson Tide will match up in the infamous Jerry World — AT&T Stadium in Dallas, 605 miles by car from Bryant-Denny Stadium in Tuscaloosa, Ala. and 1,422 miles along the shortest route to the Coliseum. 
USC fans travel well (albeit less so in recent years), but this is Alabama we’re talking about. Given that and the respective mileage, it’s hard to imagine a full stadium would yield anything but a Crimson Tide crowd. (Plus, who voluntarily ventures to the South unless you’re already in the South?)
But eliminate that crowd altogether. All of a sudden, it’s not quite as much of a home game for Nick Saban’s bunch. USC now has a fighting chance — to get stomped by only 30 rather than 50. (Sorry, I had to say it.)
Games No. 2 and 3 in the Tough Cookies slate are in Eugene, Ore. against the defending Pac-12 champs and Salt Lake City against the reigning Pac-12 South champs. USC is 0-3 in its last three games in Salt Lake City and 1-3 in its last four games in Eugene. USC indisputably has a tough time winning in these cities, and who’s to say that would change in 2020?That is — unless the stands are empty. Unless the elevation in Utah and the, uh, trees (?) in Oregon are what’s been giving USC trouble all along, the Trojans will clearly have a less daunting task ahead of them if these games are essentially played at neutral sites.
Now, the last two Tough Cookies: home games against Washington and Notre Dame. Start with the former. Throw Alabama, Utah, Oregon and Washington into a pool and pick the least intimidating opponent. If you have even the slightest semblance of college football awareness, you’ll go with Washington — which makes this game the one in which the Trojans can most afford to sacrifice home crowd advantage. 
Sure, there’s also Notre Dame. But how much will a non-conference game at the season’s end mean for a team that figures to compete for a Rose Bowl — which is based on conference record — and not the rankings-based College Football Playoff? Beyond bragging rights, not much. Of all the Tough Cookies, this is probably the one USC fans should care about least. 
The other thing about those two home games against the Huskies and Fighting Irish? Washington is USC’s third-to-last game of the regular season, Notre Dame is USC’s last. There’s a real possibility that USC takes on Alabama and Utah in Weeks 1 and 5 on the road without fans, then social distancing restrictions ease up and Trojan fans show up in droves to take on Washington and Notre Dame in Weeks 11 and 13.
Another possibility: California, which is far ahead of most states in terms of bending the coronavirus curve, maintains restrictions the whole season while the eagerness of governors in states like Utah and Texas to reopen everything and ease social distancing guidelines might backfire and bring about a second wave, necessitating stronger social distancing policies into college football season. Just saying, if you really want to see college football this year, you might want to listen to the medical experts on this one.
Obviously, I’m not even touching on the impact empty stadiums would have on the fans trying to fill those stadiums, student-athletes who enjoy playing in front of packed houses and ticket revenue for athletic departments including USC’s. That’ll all go to shit, I’m not gonna lie to you.
But at the end of the day, the team’s job is to win games, and from that standpoint, silent stadiums might not be the worst thing for USC.

The prospect of cheering in the stands of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is a light at the end of the tunnel for many Trojans amid the chaos of current events. During times like these, the notion of gathering together to celebrate the great traditions of USC football under a warm autumn sun seems like nothing short of paradise.
For some eager fans, the only thing that could possibly improve this daydream is an ice-cold beer.
Unfortunately for them, they won’t find one anywhere on the menu at concession stands in the Coliseum. Since the 2005 season, the sale or possession of alcoholic beverages has been strictly prohibited at the Coliseum during USC football games. Those caught violating this prohibition face the possible consequence of being permanently banned from attending future games.
Prior to that season, students, faculty and other sports fans of legal drinking age were more than welcome to purchase and consume alcohol while they rooted for cardinal and gold. However, insisting that alcohol was to blame for reports of crude behavior at games, then-USC President Steven Sample banned booze from being sold inside of the stadium. This attempt to curtail inebriation at the venue aligned with the Sample administration’s push to reorient University culture around its newly-created moniker: the “Trojan Family.”
The presence of drunk and raucous college students at football games conflicted with the Sample administration’s vision of a wholesome, family-friendly event. Rather than risk the embarrassing possibility of offending potential boosters (or their children) by college students under the influence, the administration eliminated access to alcohol within the Coliseum’s gates — but only for students and the general audience.
Unsurprisingly, the administration’s own luxurious suites and private boxes have continued to be exempt from this policy. Tickets to the Coliseum’s variety of private lounges, suites and boxes include access to premium cocktails and other beverages as a part of the staggering price-tag — an amount which frequently surpasses several thousands of dollars each.
Of course, there are no analogous accommodations in the student section of the Coliseum. Under this policy, USC students who pay to see their classmates compete on the field are not allowed to enjoy the same alcoholic comforts as those privileged enough to have a spot in the Scholarship Club Tower or the Field Suite. 
At USC in particular, college football originated as an integral aspect of the undergraduate experience. It was and continues to be a focal point for the community, an avenue through which students could escape from the anxieties of their studies and support their school’s team. While this humble origin has ballooned into the lucrative spectacle that it is today, college football remains an essential part of ordinary life on campus. 
As the University continues to ascend in academic prestige and the curricula become increasingly intense, those select autumn Fridays and Saturdays are an ever-more invaluable outlet for students to unwind. At its core, college football — at USC and elsewhere — is played primarily for the enjoyment, entertainment and relaxation of students and fans. By refusing to allow students to drink alcohol as a part of this respite, University administrators continue to demonstrate the prioritization of outside parties — and of their pocketbooks in particular — at the expense of USC students. 
Moreover, by exempting themselves from their expectations for others, the administration continues to reinforce a culture of elitist hypocrisy. As a result, the University denigrates those same students whose interests it is supposed to serve. Abolishing this policy and permitting the sale of alcohol to students and other common patrons of the Coliseum would drastically ameliorate the morale of a student body that has consistently been beleaguered.
Besides, let’s face it: After what could eventually amount to months of quarantining, we could all use a drink or two come football season.

Resilience is defined by Merriam-Webster as the “ability to recover or adjust easily to misfortune or change.” While vague, this seemingly basic definition gives us a window into the idea that hardships fundamentally change who we are — if not how we act and react — as members of society. In every sense of the word, resilience is a pretty sought-after personality trait and is generally seen as a sign of strength.
If we take a bit of a deeper look though, we notice that resilience in humans is almost always a result of some sort of psychological adversity. It’s almost as if it is seen as a token of trauma, which isn’t always the case; hardship does not necessarily breed resilience. Rather, resilience is more commonly built through hindsight and fostered in childhood. Yet, there’s only so much that teaching resilience can do as tribulation is often a test of resilience and not everyone faces affliction in childhood.
It’s fair to say that amid the spread of the coronavirus the entire world is experiencing hardship. The return to some sense of normalcy will require an understanding and fostering of resilience. This is especially true for those on the frontlines of combating the virus — healthcare professionals, grocery store workers, anyone who isn’t holed up in their home — but it is still applicable to pretty much everyone. It’s important to understand that one person’s pain does not minimize another’s while still understanding that there’s a spectrum of strife.
For a while I didn’t think of myself as a resilient person. I had experienced a good brunt of adversity as a child, but I never thought that made me resilient or strong — although my family and peers commonly professed I was on a daily basis. Truth be told, trauma didn’t make me resilient or strong — at least not directly. It made me feel vulnerable to everyone around me, and it made me feel weak. 
As a result, I let my pride and desire to be viewed as neurotypical prevent me from doing what is emotionally intelligent — seeking resilience by ignoring the very brutal reality of my strife and following the status quo in academics, social life and the like. I often felt leery of confessing my need for more support or accommodations to my teachers or peers, scared of being pitied and viewed as weak. Needless to say, it not only didn’t work, but also left me feeling more defeated. 
It wasn’t until I had given myself the room to properly heal, reflect and develop hindsight that I cultivated a backbone again and saw my hardships as a precursor to my resilience and strength. And I’m still working on it every day. Swallowing my pride and coming to the conclusion that my work and attitude were made worse by ignoring my sorrows was one of the best things that ever happened to my mental health, relationships with friends and family and life in general.
With that said, I don’t completely fault myself for minimizing the extent to which my pain affected me. Societal and cultural norms have a tendency to ignore mental obstacles that are a result of adversity. I’ve found that, especially in the United States, the sentiment that persists is “business as usual,” the nuances of strife often being overlooked and buried in order to keep up with the status quo. The reality of life and its circumstances do not coincide with this sentiment, though, and they certainly do not align with the true meaning of resilience. In the long-run, this attitude is more destructive than it is constructive.
Nonetheless, these unique circumstances offer a time for real constructive social change. Insight offered from words like resilience, that are so commonly thrown around in times of trial and tribulation, can especially serve us now and going forward. We will come out of this and build resilience together. 
As I end this semester, I hope that my column has offered some solace to those who have been so kind as to read what I have to say. I hope that it has offered a sense of solidarity to those who often feel their mental health is easily overlooked. I hope that, together, we can continue the conversation of the importance of mental health and wellness to ultimately cultivate a community that is more sensitive to one another.

As the cannabis smokers’ holiday rolled around April 20, I was reminded of how much weed culture has grown. From hearing about the legal ramifications of smoking weed in earlier years through documentaries about the ’60s to gradual medical legalization, it is fascinating to see how accepted cannabis has become in our society. Not only is it recreationally legal in several states, but it is now becoming more mainstream and marketable than ever with cannabis-themed shows, restaurants and technologies. Netflix’s “Cooked with Cannabis” is one such product. 
“We are able to put something that has been demonized, and that is still not completely legal, and we’re bringing it to the forefront to show that it is not about loser stoners,” said singer-songwriter, chef and host Kelis Rogers in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. 
As the title suggests, the “MasterChef”-esque show has chefs compete against one another to create dishes using a shared ingredient: cannabis. The show is hosted by Rogers and weed chef Leather Storrs, while a panel of guest stars also provides commentary and judges the competition, dropping occasional weed-related jokes and remarks. 
The hosts and guests oversee three rounds of cooking and taste the weed-infused foods, getting higher after every round from both the food and aroma from cooking. Because of this, the contest becomes rather pointless as the judges get more and more stoned; the show continues, but the judges’ perceptions change as munchies set in and all the food begins to indistinguishably taste good.
To accompany that, the humor from the hosts and guests often falls short. Any mention of cannabis comes in the form of corny, dry jokes that one would expect from a poorly written movie where characters smoke weed and overreact to their high. 
Despite the revolutionary aspects of “Cooked with Cannabis,” the show is not so much to further cannabis culture but simply employs a familiar cooking show format and adds a twist.
Kelis claims she wants to remove the stigma surrounding weed yet emphasizes one of the biggest stigmas by portraying “loser stoners” as a negative image. Also, the cannabis knowledge shared on screen is nowhere near the level of depth a series like this should display. 
There were over six million arrests relating to cannabis between 2010 and 2018 according to the ACLU, most of them having to do with possession. Mention of the MORE Act, which details plans for national legalization, would also greatly benefit the cannabis community as a whole but the hosts and guests fail to mention any of this. This is the kind of discourse expected from a modern cannabis-themed show, yet the hosts and guests never dive into any kind of informative conversations regarding cannabis and legalization. 
Many companies use the 4/20 holiday to raise awareness about the continuous legal problems involving cannabis in the United States. According to a report by the ACLU, Black people are 3.6 times more likely to be arrested for cannabis-related offences compared to white people nationwide. Ben and Jerry’s Pecan Resist campaign highlights this legal disparity, an example of how a show like “Cooked with Cannabis” can use its platform to bring more light to important issues like this rather than simply attack stigmas. 
Instead, they just sit back, get high and wait for free food. If you don’t care to learn about cannabis history and culture, then this might be the show for you, but the overall gentrified portrayal of cannabis in mainstream media is lackluster.
It’s sobering to see the guests take the competition less seriously as they get higher. If you’re not getting high alongside them, or even if you are, it’s not enjoyable to watch these people act foolishly in the background. Even the contestants themselves often seem relaxed and aren’t even sure about how much THC they end up using in some of their creations. 
The only positive take away from the show is the culinary creations the chefs are able to make using different cannabis-infused ingredients. The “Smash Burger” with mimosa-infused charred poblano butter that contains around 2 milligrams of THC is something I definitely wouldn’t mind trying; the watermelon cocktail with THC powder-infused elderflower also sounds appetizing. These meals and drinks are innovative and show a glimpse of new ways of integrating cannabis into food. The commentary, lead up and basically anything but the food presentation, however, is simply not worth it.
While this show doesn’t do much for cannabis culture as a whole, it is exciting to see cannabis become more commonplace and celebrated on a day like 4/20.

Set to the ringtone “Uplift,” my alarm goes off at precisely 10 a.m. (maybe 9:30 depending on the day). I reach over, turn it off, nap for another five minutes and finally drag myself out of bed. And then my day starts in a similar fashion as yesterday: work out, attend Zoom lectures, finish homework, eat food, FaceTime friends, pray, shower and sleep. I wake up the next day and the next only to do the same routine all over again. 
What has unfortunately also become part of my daily routine is telling myself “don’t worry, you’ll finish that tomorrow” even though I know I probably won’t. It’s like I keep waiting for something adrenaline-inducing to happen, something that could really justify my procrastination — but nothing ever does. So I wait until the next day, and the next day and the next, praying for something (it’s unclear what) to come. 
But it never comes. 
I’ve been stuck in this same cycle without even realizing it. And it’s only intensified with quarantine. Sure, in the beginning, I was eager to be productive and creative with my time (by securing internships, fine-tuning my photography skills and more), but now I’ve succumbed to a new yet unchanging quarantine routine — one that involves even more intensified procrastination and unproductiveness. As a result, I can’t help but think about an existential play I read in an IB English class in high school.
Written in 1949 by Irish playwright Samuel Beckett, the two-act tragicomedy “Waiting for Godot” tells the story of two men, Vladimir and Estragon, waiting for the arrival of a third who (spoiler alert) never comes. Each act follows a day in the life of these two men that mirrors the last with uncanny similarity: They meet the same people and wait for the same person — Godot — over and over again. Vladimir and Estragon believe that waiting for the third man is necessary to receive meaning about their existence and their purpose. Even though he doesn’t come the first day, they determinedly repeat the same monotonous routine the next day. 
On almost every page, there are moments when Estragon turns to Vladimir and asks him what they are doing, as if he’d forgotten what they did the day before. At times, he tells his friend, “Let’s go,” indicating that he wanted to do something else but is met with a fierce response from Vladimir, who spits back, “We can’t … We’re waiting for Godot.” The repetitiveness of  this conversation denotes the majority of the play’s prose, highlighting Beckett’s recurring theme of choice and, more importantly, its significant power. 
Blinded by their need for clarity regarding “the meaning of life,” Vladimir and Estragon kill time waiting for someone who supposedly has the answer to it all. In doing so, they fail to realize that this very act of waiting is indeed a choice in itself. 
Stuck in a seemingly endless cycle, the two men are unable to translate a conscious decision into a physical act. So at the end of Act 2, even though Vladimir and Estragon agree to find shelter as the moon appears and night falls, they continue to stand silently, unmoving, like statues, returning to the same spot each day.
I’ve never truly understood the meaning of Beckett’s absurd play until now. The extra alone time on my hands has given me a chance to reflect and what I’ve realized is that though we may not like to acknowledge it, many of us have a lot in common with Vladimir and Estragon. Sure, we aren’t wanderers who wear bowler hats, but we nevertheless share their monotonous behavior of waiting.
Like Vladimir and Estragon, we’re all in a state of internal pause, sucked into a never-ending time loop. Waiting for a text back. Waiting for a show to return. Waiting for the lecture to end. Waiting for something — whatever it may be. But unlike the two of them, we have the advantage of knowing we have the freedom to choose. And it is this knowledge that will help us break our daily cycle of habit and inaction. 
Because ultimately, as Vladimir points out to Estragon near the end of Act 2, “We have time to grow old. The air is full of our cries. But habit is a great deadener.” 
So let’s try to get rid of our bad habits. We all have the choice to do something better. Let’s stop recreating yesterday while praying today will be miraculously different. 
Shutting off my morning alarm (after the first time it rings) with enthusiasm, I’m ready to embrace tomorrow’s new day — a day that’ll feature less waiting and more doing. From here on out, I’ve promised myself to spice up my dull routine and use newfound time to try new things. And I hope you do the same even after quarantine ends. You, and only you, have the choice to change something in your life. 
So stop waiting around for something to happen. Just go out there and start doing.
