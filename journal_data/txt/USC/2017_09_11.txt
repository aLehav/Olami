Going into this past weekend, women’s soccer head coach Keidane McAlpine and his team knew what they needed to improve on: bringing the energy — especially in the first half — and capitalizing on early opportunities. With those objectives, the women’s soccer team beat both Santa Clara and Iowa State at home.
On Friday, the Trojans started their two-game stretch facing off against Santa Clara. The Broncos entered the game with a 2-3-1 record, having played a couple tough Pac-12 teams including No. 1 UCLA. But the experience of playing top-tier teams was not enough to help the Broncos in their battle with the Trojans.
As McAlpine had hoped, the Women of Troy came into the game on fire. For the first 20 minutes of the match, the Trojan offense was creating opportunities left and right but was unable to capitalize on their chances. To add to the dominance, the USC defense managed to push Santa Clara to the outside of the field, preventing the Broncos from moving inside the Trojans’ box.
However, the Trojan defense broke down and allowed a goal to freshman forward Kelsey Turnbow midway through the first half. Although the Trojan defense began to fade, the Broncos were denied any further goals. If it were not for two jaw-dropping saves by redshirt freshman goalkeeper Kayla Collins, the Women of Troy could have easily entered the half trailing by 3 goals.
Per usual, the Women of Troy re-established focus at halftime and returned to play a magnificent second half. The intensity surged back into the Trojan offense resulting in goals from each member of the freshman duo — Savannah DeMelo and Tara McKeown. The equalizer came in the 58th minute after junior forward Leah Pruitt raced down the right side of the field and placed a perfect pass onto the foot of DeMelo, who tapped the ball in to tie the score at 1-1.
The tie seemed to have only sparked the Trojans’ offense more as they continued to pound shots toward the Broncos’ goal. In under 10 minutes, the Women of Troy converted the
go-ahead goal with a blistering shot from McKeown in the 66th minute.
For the final 10 minutes of the match, Santa Clara threatened to score multiple times but failed to find the equalizer. With the win, the Trojans improved their record to 3-1 heading into their game against Iowa State.
In a post-game interview, McAlpine discussed the first half performance of his team and how he plans to build on the performance heading into Sunday.
“I wouldn’t say [the first 30 minutes] were great, I would say they were better,” McAlpine said. “What would make it great is the discipline on the finishing, the discipline on the defending and not breaking down in those moments — ending more tackles in the middle of the field.”
In the Sunday match against the Iowa State Cyclones, the Women of Troy took another step in the right direction. At the start of the contest, the Trojans were energetic, aggressive, strong defensively and absolutely dominant. However, the Trojans’ intensity diminished later in the game. Despite the improvement, McAlpine believes his team needs to finish the match the way they started.
“Today was one of our best efforts in that area,” he said. “However, I was disappointed in our ability to maintain our competitiveness and energy throughout the 90 minutes of the game.”
The Trojans opened the first half with their fastest goal of the season. USC took an early lead in the 7th minute as junior forward Leah Pruitt attacked a deflected pass and found the back of the Iowa State net. The Women of Troy returned to the Cyclone’s zone to add another goal just 12 minutes later. From the top of the 18-yard box, sophomore defender Julia Bingham launched a shot toward sophomore keeper Antonia Reyes. Before Reyes could get a hand on the ball redshirt senior forward Alex Anthony deflected it into the bottom left corner of the net to extend the Trojans’ lead to 2 goals.
The Trojans’ offense had several scoring opportunities in the second half, none of which were converted.
“[We] got the goals early,” Pruitt said. “We could have done better staying with that intensity.”
USC’s defense limited the Cyclones to seven shots, all of which came in the second half and none of which were on target. As a result, redshirt freshman keeper Kayla Collins recorded her second shutout of the season, without making a save. 
The Trojans now head back on the road with a proud 4-1 record to compete with Loyola Marymount and San Diego.

This past weekend, the women’s volleyball team traveled to Santa Barbara, Calif., to compete in the Thunderdome Classic.  The Trojans prevailed in all three of their matches, which included tournament wins against Arkansas, UC Santa Barbara and Yale.  These victories extend the Trojans overall season record to 7-2.
Entering the matches, USC was ranked 19th in the country and anticipated to win its matches.  But the first tournament match against the University of Arkansas turned out to be a challenge as the Trojans barely pulled out the victory in five sets (22-25,
25-21, 20-25, 26-24, 15-9).  Arkansas and USC both brought their best defense to the match; both teams combined for 31 blocks.  The Razorbacks accounted for 16 of those blocks, and they kept the Trojans on a season-low .176 hitting percentage.
For the Trojans, junior libero Victoria Garrick was a key contributor in holding Arkansas to a .168 percentage by having 20 digs in the match.
After the tough match with Arkansas, the Trojans managed to rebound with a sweep of UC Santa Barbara (25-16, 25-16, 25-20).  Against the Gauchos, the Trojans found their groove as they improved their hitting percentage to .389, which they achieved with no errors in the first two sets.  Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier led the Trojans with 10 kills, junior outside hitter Alyse Ford added nine kills and senior opposite hitters Brittany Abercrombie and Niki Withers scored seven kills each.
The Trojan offense also received contributions from their setters, especially against UCSB.  With an accumulated 41 assists between senior setter Reni Meyer-Whalley and sophomore setter Cindy Marina, the Trojans had 46 kills that match in comparison with Santa Barbara’s 26.
In the final match of the tournament against Yale, the Trojans were not contested and defeated the Bulldogs in three sets (25-19, 25-21, 25-12).  Junior outside hitter Alyse Ford swung for an impressive .562 percentage with 10 kills.  Sophomore outside hitter Khalia Lanier also had 10 kills on a .214 attack percentage.  
Throughout the match with the Bulldogs, the Trojans only trailed once.  Their performance earned the squad its third match sweep of the season.  
The Trojans will continue play next weekend in the Maryland Classic against Maryland and Oklahoma.

In the weeks leading up to the season, head coach Clay Helton remained optimistic that redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe would return to the field at full strength. However, the former Florida transfer’s leg injury has failed to improve as expected, and for now, he will be shut down until further notice. 
After sitting out much of spring practice with a shoulder issue, Imatorbhebhe injured the area around his hip and thigh about a month ago. He returned to practice a week before the first game and even played against Western Michigan, recording one catch for 11 yards and making a few key blocks for running backs junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr. 
However, his condition apparently took a turn for the worse after Week 1, and Imatorbhebhe did not dress out against Stanford last Saturday. Now, Helton is offering no timetable for his return. He is listed as doubtful for this weekend’s game against Texas. 
“I was hoping that it would get better and better but it’s just not,” Helton said. “So I’d rather at that position, how much change of direction there is, just shut him down, let the doctors, physicians get him healthy and get him back.”
Though the Trojans scored 42 points against the Cardinal without him, Imatorbhebhe’s absence could still prove to be a significant loss to their offensive line. Last year, the tight end emerged as one of redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold’s favorite red-zone targets. He was the team’s fourth-leading receiver in 2016, racking up 250 yards with four of his 17 receptions going for touchdowns. 
“He’s one of those very, very specially skilled athletes, and if they’re not 100 percent right, it’s hard,” Helton said. “So we’re going to invest in getting him
100 percent and however long that takes I really don’t have a crystal ball for.”
Junior Tyler Petite filled Imatorbhebhe’s role as starting tight end in the first two games of this season. Petite has caught six passes for 59 yards in his teammate’s absence, and he is a seasoned veteran. He appeared in all 13 games for USC in 2016, catching 10 passes for 156 yards and two touchdowns.
In addition to Imatorbhebhe’s injury, Helton also delivered news on redshirt freshman kicker Michael Brown, who was injured on a kickoff against the Cardinal. Brown suffered a torn ACL and will miss the remainder of the season, meaning freshman Chase McGrath will handle both placekicking and kickoff duties for the remainder of the campaign.
The news will come as a bitter blow to Brown, who entered the preseason as the presumptive favorite to replace 2016 starter Matt Boermeester. McGrath has yet to kick a field goal in his career, but he has knocked through all 13 of his extra-point attempts.

Sometimes an answered prayer can be a curse, not a blessing. 
It was only a few weeks ago that I had some great concerns about the state of my Los Angeles Dodgers. I was terrified. The club was coming off of a historic 52-9 run over a 61-game stretch. The bats were blazing, pitching was on lockdown mode and the Dodgers had amassed a 20-game lead on second-place Arizona in the NL West. 
With every home run, walk-off hit and shutdown pitching performance, I cringed more and more. I feared that the Dodgers may have been using up all of their “mojo” far too early in the campaign. Everything about this team a few weeks ago just felt too magical — it was all too ideal. Too much good was floating around the team in the dog days of summer. 
In casual conversations with colleagues and friends, I actually proposed the notion that the Dodgers needed a bit of controversy and failure. I pled for the Dodgers to undergo a stumbling block; a little five-game losing streak would do us some good, I thought. Maybe Yasiel Puig could even get into it with a teammate in the clubhouse and throw a punch or something? That would be a nice little storm that would rattle the heavenly ambiance which this team had. Everything was too rosy and perfect in Dodgertown. 
Well, it’s safe to say that my wish has been granted beyond measure. 
The Dodgers did in fact undergo that five-game losing spell I hoped for. The team dropped five consecutive contests at the end of August, which included getting swept by the Arizona Diamondbacks out in the desert. While others began to squirm in their chairs and on social media about the mini winning drought, I was calm and collected, assured that this team needed a healthy taste of defeat.
On Sept. 1, Clayton Kershaw did snap the Dodgers’ losing streak with six innings of shutout baseball against the San Diego Padres in his first start off the disabled list. Los Angeles came away with a 1-0 win in San Diego that night. 
What has followed that game has been a cataclysmic pitfall in the eyes of many Angeleno sports fans. 
Since Sept. 2, the Dodgers have lost 10 consecutive games, the longest losing spell of any team in the majors this season. The undisputed best team in baseball for the majority of 2017 has played the poorest baseball of any team in the bigs over the past two weeks. 
This Dodgers team, which pulled off the winningest 50-game stretch in the majors since 1912 (43-7), is the same team which has lost 15 of its last 16 contests overall. In fact, Los Angeles has become the first team in Major League history to have both a 15-1 and a 1-15 stretch in the same regular season. That’s not the type of history you typically want to make. 
The 20-game division lead which the Dodgers had over Arizona on Aug. 26 has since dwindled to nine games. While the chances of a division title choke-job by the Dodgers are nearly impossible with only 19 games remaining this season, Los Angeles doesn’t want to see that gap with the Diamondbacks get any smaller. However, despite the immense struggles of late,  it must be noted that the Dodgers (92-57) still hold a four-game lead on the Washington Nationals (88-55) for home-field advantage. 
Looking at some of the numbers for this team, you can see why this team has spiraled the way it has. 
Over the past 16 games, this Dodger offense has hit at an anemic .200 clip while averaging only 2.4 runs per game. Over that span, the Dodgers haven’t been much better on the mound, either. In addition to not receiving production from offensive catalysts like Cody Bellinger and Chris Taylor, the Dodgers’ newly-acquired Curtis Grandson has hit a brutal .085 since being acquired by the team on Aug. 19. Also, many Dodger fans have been quick to note that the team is 7-17 since Adrian Gonzalez rejoined the club on Aug. 18. 
Over the same stretch, the Dodgers haven’t been much better on the mound, either. In his last start on Sept. 7 against the Diamondbacks at home, Kershaw wasn’t anywhere near his usual self — allowing four runs in only three and two-thirds innings of work. Overall, the Dodgers’ pitching staff has accumulated an ERA of 5.81 over the past 16 games.
Now, is it time to completely hit the panic button? No. 
The Dodgers are still the owners of the best record in all of baseball. And with 19 games remaining, there is still a good chance that this team will hit the 100-win mark for the season if they find a way to play .500 ball through the finish line. 
But let me balance my optimism with some necessary pessimism: No team has ever won the World Series after undergoing a 10-game losing streak in the regular season.  
All I wanted for my Dodgers was a healthy dosage of turbulence. But what I have seen instead is a brutal nosedive into the earth as the regular season’s conclusion nears, and a pressure-packed postseason commences.

As Hurricane Irma swept into Florida last weekend, all eyes were on Miami and Tampa and other well-populated cities in the state where yet another natural disaster threatened immense destruction mere weeks after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas. Behind Irma, however, the damage was already done: on the U.S. Virgin Islands, and several other Caribbean nations that battled the hurricane when it was still considered a Category 5. And despite the devastation incurred there, the Virgin Islands and its neighboring islands received muted attention from the news and social media, despite their popularity as tourist destinations.
It’s worth comparing to an incident that surrounded another U.S. territory earlier last month, when North Korea toyed with the possibility of a missile test directed at Guam: a small island between Hawaii and the Philippines. Guam is very much a part of the United States — but that didn’t stop President Donald Trump from flippantly discussing the region like it was far detached from anything that matters to Americans. True, Trump made a bevy of concerning statements regarding the possibility of nuclear war with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s regime. But one of the most disturbing was his flippant response: “Let’s see what he does with Guam” — as if the island were only a piece of bait, as if Guam were not populated with members of the American public, as if the people who live on the island are not people at all. 
The immeasurable gap that exists between the presidential administration and the marginalized people it governs is a profound lack of empathy, one that unfortunately draws its power from the same roots shared by the media’s practice of focusing on the stories and humanity of white people above that of everyone else. The U.S. territories have never received their fair share of attention from both the politicians and citizens who live in the continental United States, but it is unimaginable that one island (among a series of Caribbean islands) may be devastated by a Category 5 hurricane and still not make a dent in the American conscience.  
With regard to Hurricane Irma, it is understandable that a massive share of the media’s attention was turned toward Florida, where plenty live and were at risk. But it is by and large no coincidence that the people who live in Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands are majority people of color (in Guam, Chamorro followed by Filipino; and in the Virgin Islands, majority black) who regardless of geographic location do not fall into a long-held notion of victims who deserve attention and empathy. 
Forgetting or ignoring the devastation (potential or realized) on these islands parallels the shameful trend of recognizing terror and tragedy only when they hit European or majority-white countries. And, besides being shameful in the current climate of national politics, this practice plays into a myopic perception of what it means to be and count as an American, where both being a citizen in a U.S. territory and being a non-citizen within the continental border gets one nowhere. 
That is not to say, necessarily, that the U.S. Virgin Islands (as well as Puerto Rico, which narrowly escaped the full impact of Irma’s blow), were totally forgotten: Trump did assign funds for the U.S. Virgin Islands after Irma’s destruction there. Still, continuous aid and relief is an imperative maintained through widespread attention, and it is precisely that in which the U.S. territories are lacking. 
It is becoming devastatingly clear that what it means to be American is no longer enough even when one is a citizen, living on American soil. Instead, what the response to Irma has made clear is that the definition still firmly rests on the old and ugly historical status quo that worth is defined by how long one’s race has been in charge. It is a thinking that influences policies and media practices, in which vulnerable and marginalized communities have less power and little say, and that cuts down on the potential for empathy precisely when these communities need it the most.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
In June, Trinity College suspended professor Johnny Eric Williams after he shared a controversial post on Facebook. The post Williams shared suggested that people of color should “let them f—ing die,” referring to white people who were racist toward non-white medical professionals. Williams’ actions yielded a social media avalanche and protests before Trinity College decided to not only suspend the sociology professor at the end of the month, but also briefly close off its campus.
The media frenzy surrounding Trinity College has since died down, but on Sunday, the Washington Post published a feature on the changing role of university professors in today’s political climate — a time when ideas that were previously unheard of throughout modern history have wormed their way back into the mainstream at the expense of many marginalized groups within America’s increasingly diverse population.
The feature, entitled “What it feels like when a professor’s comments ignite a fury,” is woven with perspectives from a number of stakeholders in this campus political shift, from a representative of the American Association of University Professors to a female professor at Georgetown University who confronted white nationalist Richard Spencer when he came to speak at the university, and was widely trolled as a result of this. 
The article serves as a clear — and not unjustified — warning of the dangers and vitriol that university faculty who dare to publicly take political stances might face. Today’s national political dialogue includes no shortage of big-picture debates, and yet the mere act of weighing in on these big-picture debates has ironically become one in and of itself — and a big one, at that. 
The definition of “being political” has dramatically broadened in the era of President Donald Trump, which is particularly impactful for university professors whose jobs can sometimes depend on their neutrality. Ultimately, in the face of this culture shift, it’s become increasingly clear that forcing college faculty to inorganically transform their classrooms into depoliticized spheres is doing more harm than good.
As a society, we’ve collectively reached a moment in which almost everything has become “politics.” Now, it has become a matter of politics to be respectful or to call your peer a “liberal snowflake” and go on speaking when they tell you a topic makes them uncomfortable; to give or not to give a platform to pseudoscience that says African Americans are biologically inferior to white people at universities. Openly taking stances about what may have once seemed like the norm — that women are the equals of men and have a right to be part of the workforce, that where you were born should not limit your access to the American Dream — has become a politically charged act. 
To be neutral at a time when that which was once self-obvious is now suddenly and dangerously on the table for discussion is no easy feat — especially for academics, many of whom have studied the historical consequences of silence in times like this. To explicitly or implicitly demand neutrality from professors who lecture about politics, history, gender, race and identity in today’s political climate benefits no one. 
Giving equal weight to fundamentally unequal ideologies establishes dangerous false equivalences that are often the forces that normalize hatred and bigotry. This can also breed ignorance in students who may be misled about history or current events if their professors equate vastly different experiences or vastly different events for the sake of adhering to a status quo that discourages them from “taking sides.”
In the era of “fake news” — a time when inaccurate information, sensationalized headlines and premature reporting, often with one slant or another, are dominating social media — students should be able to rely on their classrooms and academic environments to be sites of truth and honest, factual discussions. And put simply, when large-scale humanitarian debates such as the reality and urgency of climate change have become written off as “politics,” it’s become impossible to provide truth and honest, factually based discussion without being “political.”
It’s quite a tall order to ask a professor to discuss climate change as a matter of “some believe it, some don’t,” when people are literally dying, starving and getting sick as a result of this ecological phenomenon. And yet, in today’s polarizing political climate, to unequivocally say that climate change is not only objective fact but also a human rights issue is to inject “liberal bias” into academic dialogue. 
As of late, the USC administration has contributed to dismantling this dangerous and prevalent norm with two community memos responding to recent Trump administration decisions. One from earlier this month clearly stated that the University supports undocumented students despite the administration’s intention to rescind the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. On Friday, the University released another statement pledging to adhere to Obama-era Title IX guidelines to protect sexual assault survivors’ rights, despite a rollback from the Department of Education. 
Today, to be nonpolitical often requires sacrificing human decency and camaraderie with the marginalized. And for academics, this also means sacrificing their intellectual integrity. But at the end of the day, addressing this dangerous norm is ultimately the fight that all university professors must take part in.

Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
The USC Thornton School of Music has recently unveiled five new master’s degree programs; the contemporary teaching practice and music industry programs will begin in May 2018, while the community music, screen scoring and arts leadership will commence the coming fall. Created largely due to the changing music industry and climate of music education, many of these new programs go against the grain and focus on expanding a student’s breadth of topics and specialties through flexible electives and final projects. Some master’s programs are accepting students without a previous music degree, instead focusing on students who have finished their undergraduate degree but still have a lingering passion for music that they want to explore.
Arts Leadership
For students who aspire to lead their own music program, the arts leadership program is the degree to pursue. Classes revolve around leadership in the contemporary arts world as well as the different dimensions associated with leadership in the field, from alternate structures for organizations to the environmental trends affecting the art world. 
To gain personalized field experience, students may choose between three options: an internship to acquire hands-on experience, a 10-day summer program detailing the essentials of orchestra management or directed research to explore aspects of fields that catch the student’s interests. Finally, students will undertake a practicum of a real world leadership position that will mirror their creative interests. As a two semester program with diverse electives, it is perfect for any student interested in any leadership position in the arts.
Community Music
As a combination of social advocacy, education and community involvement, the creative music degree is for students with diverse interests looking to bring their talents outside of the sound booth or concert stage. The two-year intensive program will help students diversify possible career pathways, including teachers, facilitators and mentors for growing artists. The classes mirror these varied goals with electives in philosophy, arts leadership, public policy and social work. 
Events hosted across Los Angeles and the USC Thornton community engagement programs promote outreach into neighboring communities, with work mainly within non-traditional settings such as hospitals, prisons, senior community centers and areas geared toward the marginalized or disadvantaged. The focuses in music teaching, arts leadership and other programs make this degree well-suited for those looking for ways to give back to the community.
Contemporary Teaching Practice
Diverging from traditional instruments, a more culturally diverse classroom, and a changed academic environment, students who wish to teach in K-12 schools, either public or private, will be well armed with the master’s degree in contemporary teaching practice. Along this pathway, students will take classes from both the Thornton School of Music and Rossier School of Education, with classes detailing both general education principles and courses specifically designed around teaching music. In addition to the degree, the program assists in certifying graduates with five-year preliminary credentials from the state of California, as well as certification through the Commission on Teacher Credentialing and the California Department of Education. The three-semester program’s capstone project is a full-time student teaching guided practice to further develop teaching skills in a real-world environment. 
Screen Scoring
The screen scoring master’s degree, a highly competitive, 20-student cohort and two-semester program, will teach students the mechanics of composing, conducting and producing music for any medium shown on a screen, from video games and live-action films to video games and virtual reality systems. A partnership with the School for Cinematic Arts will allow for collaboration with fellow students in filmmaking and game design to compose up to 10 scoring projects. Given their interconnectedness with other industries, classes aren’t limited to solely music; students may also choose related topics in technology, business and the movie industry. The goal is for students to develop a portfolio of original scores over the course of the program.
Music Industry
Spearheaded by Thornton’s new music industry program chair, this three-semester program is geared toward those who have a lifelong passion for music and the program accepts those without a previous degree in the music field. The first semester details the basics of business, the music industry and entrepreneurship, while the second semester mainly consists of planning, producing and pitching their individually crafted master’s degree campaign. The third semester’s online night courses are designed to save time for working students, who will also begin executing their prepared campaign, whether that be running a live music event, creating an online web series, or collaborating with local artists for a passion project. The small, 15-to-25 student cohort will keep discussions centered and inspire collaboration, and the four emphasis options in music supervision/visual media, applied music performance, live music touring and musical entrepreneurship allow students to tailor the program to their interests.

After five years in the making, Mutemath’s highly anticipated Play Dead finally arrived on Friday. Despite some lineup changes resulting in the departure of Roy Mitchell-Cárdenas and Darren King, two of the original band members, the Grammy-nominated band did not disappoint its fans with an album that perfectly showcases what Mutemath is all about.
Play Dead features a much more experimental electronic rock vibe than previous albums by Mutemath, but nonetheless radiates its signature sound. At a mere 51 minutes, the album features 10 tracks, including the singles “Hit Parade,” “Stroll On” and “War.” Mutemath opted for longer songs, often featuring instrumental breakdowns. 
Play Dead comes just under two years after Mutemath’s previous album, Vitals, was released and reached No. 49 on the U.S. Billboard 200. This is the band’s sophomore record released with Wotjeck Records, a record label created and owned by Mutemath since 2015. Though released only recently, lead singer Paul Meany explained via Instagram that the album took five years to make and that he is grateful for everyone’s patience. 
The album opens with “Hit Parade,” which was the first single released in June to promote Play Dead. While “Hit Parade” is a five-minute track, the listener never gets bored of the song. Despite starting slow, the song quickly hits the catchy chorus, repeating, “Tie yourself to me, Cavernous jewelry, I’m on your shoulder, Don’t leave me sober.” A relaxing, yet upbeat melody combined with synths and drums makes “Hit Parade” one of the best tracks on the album. The song finds a perfect balance of classic rock and more experimental electronic sounds.

“Hit Parade” leads into “Pixie Oaks,” the second track of the album. In contrast to “Hit Parade,” “Pixie Oaks” starts immediately with a chirpy beat. Featuring a mid-song breakdown and catchy riffs throughout the song, “Pixie Oaks” definitely has the potential to be a hit. 
The third track of the album “Stroll On” features a much more cheerful backtrack. Filled with catchy drum beats and a beautiful harp melody, the song creates a feeling of peace for the listener. With a funky breakdown toward the end of the song, “Stroll On” captures the sound of Mutemath. 
The most recent single and the eighth album track “War” takes on a much more aggressive sound than previous songs. With a killer electric guitar carrying the song and some groovy breakdowns, “War” embodies more of Mutemath’s classic rock sound compared to a track like “Achilles Heel,” which features much more experimental sounds. The album closes with the six-minute long “Marching To The End,” which is filled with ballads and a soft melody. Mutemath had a decent mix of slower tracks like “Nuisance” and “Placed On Hold” and more energetic tracks like “Break The Fever” and “Everything’s New.”
After accompanying Twenty One Pilots on its Emotional Roadshow World Tour in the summer of 2016, Mutemath has gained a new audience and following. Combined with its quality album, the band should expect to have a successful touring season this fall. The band will embark on a 31-date U.S. tour starting in September to promote Play Dead. Mutemath will perform in Los Angeles on Oct. 13 at The Wiltern and in Santa Ana on Oct. 14 at The Observatory. 
Although Mutemath released their previous album only two years ago, Play Dead is a great comeback album and should put Mutemath back on the radar for a while. Given its success on tour with Twenty One Pilots and prior achievements, Mutemath should expect to gain a lot of positive attention with Play Dead. The album perfectly encapsulates Mutemath’s bold and unique sound and strikes the perfect balance between classic alternative sound and groovy experimental sound. An album full of genuine and solid songs, instrumental breakdowns and catchy choruses, Mutemath has truly defined its sound through Play Dead.

Opening night at LA Opera is probably my favorite night of the year. I’ve been to every opening performance for the last five years and I’ve gone alone to most of them. But this year, like the last, I took my boyfriend Matthew. This season’s premiere was Georges Bizet’s Carmen, an opera that seems to be largely known by the general public. It has remained a main staple in operatic repertoire since its 1875 premiere and is a guilty pleasure of mine.
Besides Bizet’s exuberant Spanish-hued score, the best thing about Carmen is the titular character herself — in short, Carmen (the character) is the baddest b-tch in all of opera. She doesn’t, nor has she ever lived her life according to a man’s liking. Yet, she craves men like sweets and tosses them after she’s taken a bite. Within the first 30 minutes of the show, she’s arrested for slashing an “X” into another woman’s face. She escapes prison by seducing her arrestor, Don José, whom she later pretends to love (Some operaphiles argue that she actually did love him at one point. I, however, remain unconvinced). She, in turn, leaves him for another. Her actions don’t catch up with her until the end, when (spoiler alert) her former suitor Don José stabs and kills her.
Leave it up to a straight man to ruin everything.
Though obviously tragic, there is something romantic about her death. Carmen didn’t conform to what José wanted her to be, and dies having never strayed from her values, no matter how skewed they were. With this in mind, one could say she died with honor. That may be bold to state, but when I reflect on death, or at least what I hope to accomplish in my life, I can think of no greater regret than to falter from my own character.
Of all my quirks and attributes I’ve always prided myself on my independence and ability to thrive in solitude. Even as a child, I learned quickly how to take care of myself. Before I met Matthew, I was content with singledom. True, I did want a boyfriend, but it had nothing to do with filling an empty void. But that’s the healthiest part of our relationship — the mutual understanding between “need” and “want”; I didn’t need a boyfriend and neither did he. And although Carmencita and I agree on many things, casual dating doesn’t make much sense to me. Or at least, at the time I met Matthew, it didn’t. I thought, what’s the point of dating if not to strive for something more serious? Though my thinking at the time may have been judgemental and sophomoric, there is something to be said about fostering meaningful relationships with those I allow into my life. When one “needs” something, the power is immediately out of one’s hands. With wanting, however, one takes control of the situation.
Adversely, “want” can be dangerous, because we always want what we can’t have. For example, while I was single, I strived for a relationship. But I had never been in as serious a relationship as I am now. So now that I’m in a relationship, I crave more alone time. Don’t get me wrong: The solitude I crave doesn’t stem from an unhappiness in the relationship. But as someone who thrives from the time I spend alone, it’s been a challenge to maintain independence without inadvertently ignoring Matthew. I feel the only time I truly have to myself is when Matthew is asleep, and I don’t feel glued to my phone, or feel the need to be present. This can be challenging, because of the tension that builds while ignoring my own needs.
My friends don’t really see my moody side. It’s a precious gem reserved only to those closest to me. Some have never seen it while others bear the brunt of it far too often. Yet even though I cherish my alone time, I do find myself yearning for Matthew after too long. The shift is quick — one minute I’m content and the very next moment I crave his presence. The shift is so quick, like the flick of a light switch after being in the dark for so long.  Your eyes need some time to adjust to the stimuli of bright light. Likewise, I need time to adjust to company. With Matthew, I need no time to adjust. Everything feels exactly where it should be, which is the best thing I could ask for in a relationship.
I’ve had to make sacrifices in my relationship. Everyone does. Matthew, I’m sure, has made equal sacrifices, ones I’m sure he’ll never talk about to me directly. And that’s fine. It’s the secrets we keep from each other that make any relationship work. These secrets make me feel like I’ve retained a bit of myself, the same me before I met Matthew. Like Carmen, my secrets are mine, and I’ll never let a man change me, for better or for worse. I cherish my idiosyncrasies, as well as my privacy. And again, like Carmen, I’d choose death over strict obedience.

Who came up with the stupid feminist statue? F*** this statue. I hope somebody tears it down.
— Sexist in South Central

Dear Sexist,
In the winter of 2014, USC President C.L. Max Nikias first invited me to campus, but it took a few years for me to arrive! I’m thrilled to finally be here, not only because I have the privilege of watching over hundreds of inspiring, diverse scholars in the University Village but also because I have the opportunity to help educate students like yourself about feminism. 
On one hand, there’s the dictionary definition of feminism. However, even my cold bronze heart can recognize that “the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes” does not inspire much further understanding of the belief. To me and many others, feminism is a movement for the pursuit of equality and fairness for all people. (One common misconception about feminists is that they hate men or believe women are superior. This is not true and the people who believe that are actually called misandrists.) 
One important aspect of feminism is supporting the freedom of choice. As a feminist, I believe a young woman should be celebrated and supported whether she chooses to pursue a career in mathematics or marketing and a young man should be celebrated and supported whether he chooses to pursue a career in dental hygiene or dance. Stereotypes about what is appropriate behaviour based on gender is sooo 424 BC.
Another aspect of feminism is the importance of recognizing the misogynist elements of our society and seeking to quash them. In just this past week, employees at Google found that female employees are paid less than their male counterparts for doing the same jobs. And earlier this year, the Harvard Business Review shared research that found venture capitalists spoke differently about entrepreneurs based on their gender: “Many of the young men and women [entrepreneurs] were described as being young, though youth for men was viewed as promising, while young women were considered inexperienced.” These are just two out of many more examples of ongoing inequality. Clearly, there’s lots of room for improvement and feminists are bravely taking it upon themselves to fix things themselves.
S, I do hope this was helpful in understanding what I stand for. If you’re still confused, I’d recommend reaching out to the USC Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment for additional information. My good friend Athena speaks very highly of them and I’m sure you would benefit from their companionship!
Here to stay,
Hecuba

“This is not true and the people who believe that are actually called misandrists.”  
Dear reverse-sexist bigot,
This is breathtakingly shameless feminist doublespeak.  Fortunately, you are about to go for good because everyone with more than one brain can see through your twisted tales of woe.  But just keep giving us more of the same because it will seal your fate and hasten the day when your evil ideology is tossed back on trash heap of history from when it came to paraphrase misandry scholars Nathason and Young.
You are attacking the writer because she said, “To me and many others, feminism is a movement for the pursuit of equality and fairness for all people.” To regard this belief as evil under the pseudonym FreedomFirst is both hypocritical and cowardly. Moreover, to feel threatened by the mere placement of a statue of a woman is a sexist sentiment. If you have a reasoned, logical, and value-driven argument against equality of the sexes, I would love to hear it. Until then, stop defending these baseless attacks.
No.  I’m attacking the writer because she lies shamelessly about her favorite female supremacist hate movement.   Feminism has nothing whatsoever to do with fairness or equality which can be seen clearly by observing the feminist response to Betsy Devos’ speech on how Obama’s OCR weaponized rape.   Feminism IS evil both in ideology and application.   We are not going to tolerate totalitarian tyranny cloaked in the sheep’s clothing of ‘equality’.   Instead, we are going to give women the equality they so richly deserve as MP Phillip Davies is doing in England.  If you were any kind of real man, you’d have done your due diligence already, given up you traitorous and suicidal chivary, and gone on the offense to cure this  deadly socio-political cancer once and for all.  Cassie Jaye’s Ted talk and film are must sees for men like you.

Welcome to Sex and the Campus, a weekly column where I discuss all things love and relationships. It should be noted that I do not claim to be any kind of expert in either area. Dating is hard, but hopefully reading this column won’t be. 
If you have any burning questions about love and relationships, or just have a good dating horror story to share feel free to send them to dailytrojanblogs@gmail.com 
This week we’re talking about the college student’s most allusive word: Balance. What does it mean, and how do we achieve it?
The short answer to that question is, we don’t. What even is balance, and why are we all chasing after it? For a USC student finding balance usually means juggling having leadership positions in at least two student organizations, an internship or two, a job, taking 18 units (and excelling in all of them), all while finding time to go out every weekend, have meaningful friendships, and — if you’ve somehow escaped the hook-up black hole — a relationship. If your head is spinning that means you understand how ridiculous it is to be held to such a standard.
A wise man once told me that balance is an illusion — I neither remember the man nor his name, but his words have always stuck with me, and I agree with him. Our brains are very powerful things, they can do a lot; just not everything. There’s a reason why young adults are burning out either half way through college, or even before they step foot on campus. The pressures on us are immense, especially in a day and age where you can put in so much and there’s not much guarantee of a job. 
When we’re feeling overextended and overwhelmed the first things to fall by the wayside are our friendships and relationships. Girl’s night turns into Girl’s-once-a-year, and date night is just a distant memory. Why is it that our first inclination is to turn away from what could restore us the most? 
I’m an isolator, my first thought when I’m feeling burned out is to turn inward and try to get some alone time. That’s not a bad thing, it’s just how I recharge. The problem is now I have a boyfriend, friends, 18 units, clubs, a job, and an internship. My world has turned into a carousel of people and responsibilities. In the tiny moments I have to catch my breath, I start to feel the creeping of guilt. I could be using my extra hour to study, or grab lunch with a friend, or even hang out with my boyfriend. When really I all I want to do is cocoon on my couch and watch One Tree Hill. 
We shouldn’t ever feel guilty for taking time for ourselves, it’s important not only for our health, but also our relationships, and our grades, and our work at our job/internship. You see, what the world doesn’t tell you is that in order to be a better friend, girlfriend, leader, or employee, you have to be a better you. That can only happen when you’re feeding your soul. Maybe that means going to the beach, or getting in a good workout, or finding a nice place to read a book, or maybe even dancing the night away at a dope party. Whatever that thing is for you, do it, and have no regrets. 
USC teaches us a lot, but it doesn’t teach us how to really care for ourselves — for the things we can’t see like our hearts, and minds, and souls. That’s why I don’t think there’s such a thing as true balance. If we do everything we can, but we lose ourselves or our relationships in the process, what really have we gained? Do what you love, and don’t feel bad for any of it. At the end of the day you truly shine when you feel whole.

Katie Chin | Daily Trojan
I used to be an incredibly shy person. I’ve been told that, as a young child, my first reaction when encountering unfamiliar adults was to cry, refuse to speak or hide behind the safety of my mom’s legs — or all three. I’m not exactly sure why I was like this. Perhaps it was because I didn’t like being at the center of anyone’s attention, nor did I enjoy being prodded by questions from doting adults, but meeting new people just seemed like such a daunting task that I avoided it at all costs. 
 
Though I eventually grew out of this phase, my tendency to remain quiet and reserved prevailed. For a long time, I found comfort in taking a more passive approach on most things; I listened and kept observations to myself instead of asking pressing questions or attempting to find answers. It all drew back to my childhood predisposition of fearing the other, the unfamiliar. Though I was no longer afraid of it, I acknowledged it just before the point of actually engaging with it. 
 
Fast forward to today, and I can confidently say I am a completely different person. I really do love talking to strangers, and I’m constantly asking others questions of “why” or “how” in hopes to understand the bigger picture of whatever is at hand. I’m no longer the timid little girl who ran away from unfamiliar faces or refused to speak when confronted with new conversation. And while some of this change can be attributed to time and maturity, sure, my shift in character and how I carry myself can be largely attributed to discovering my love for journalism. I joined my high school’s newspaper during my sophomore year and have been involved in campus publications and various reporting internships ever since. 
 
Put simply, journalism has given me the confidence and skills I never knew I lacked until they had already become second-nature. It emboldened me to talk to people I would normally have no business speaking to, and the constant demand to interview complete strangers about potentially any topic helped me develop the fearlessness to strike up conversation with anyone, whether it be a head coach, distinguished professor or school administrator. Through these experiences, I’ve learned that everyone has a story to share if you ask the right questions.
 
Consequently, journalism has allowed me to get used to asking tough questions and expecting answers in return. I can hold people accountable, and I don’t need their permission to do so. I’m not afraid to ask questions that others might assume would put them in an uncomfortable situation, because if I don’t ask them, then who will?  
 
Getting used to thinking on your feet comes naturally in a fast-paced news environment, and journalism has taught me again and again the importance of  meeting deadlines and performing under pressure. However, even when my stress levels are high and my hours of sleep are low, my passion for journalism remains. 
 
I think the reasoning behind my sense of confidence lies in the fact that I believe journalism serves a greater purpose, beyond myself. I love the craft not only because it’s led me to become more well-spoken, well-written and well-informed, but also because I see it as a commitment to inform the public and advocate for those who do not have a voice. Journalism is a platform that I can call my own. 
 
Just as my early experiences with journalism emboldened my character throughout high school, it has also supported me in the next chapter of my life: college. Through working at the Daily Trojan, I’ve acquired the confidence and knowledge to dive into the vast world that is USC without looking back. What better way is there to acclimate to campus life than by reporting on it? 
 
The Daily Trojan has become my home, my family, and where I spend almost every evening — glued to a huge Mac in the top floor of the Student Union building until late hours of the night. I spend more time in the newsroom than I do my apartment, and willingly so. I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else other than surrounded by people who I’ve come to appreciate as incredible journalists, colleagues and — most importantly — close friends.

Austin Paik | Daily Trojan
In the final drive of the second quarter, redshirt quarterback Sam Darnold finally came alive.
It wasn’t that his night had been subpar — he threw a perfect first half, consistently hitting his receivers and buying time in the backfield to keep busted plays alive. But when he opened the final drive of the half with a 49-yard pass to Steven Mitchell Jr., Darnold found a way to silence the doubt that began to cloud his Heisman hopes after a disappointing season opener.
The ball hung in the air long enough for every fan in the stands to crane their necks to watch it, then dropped perfectly into Mitchell’s arms as he crashed into the ground. The crowd went wild, as any crowd will when it witnesses a hero step up fully into his spotlight. The roar was equally as loud one play later, when Darnold connected a 25-yard pass to Burnett, who dove and stretched out to snag the ball in the end zone.
The team carried its 28-17 lead into the half, entering the locker room to a rumbling cheer. Coaches and players alike danced off the field and leapt to chest bump each other. 
It was a completely different scene than what took place just a week earlier, when the Trojans trudged into the locker room to smattered boos. And the game was a different feeling for the team as well, as USC went on to top Stanford 35-24, breaking a three-year losing streak to the Cardinal. 
“There was an energy about our kids and a confidence about our kids,” Helton said. “We’ve had a lot of hard roads and hard days with [Stanford] in the past. Our kids had their jaws set and had the mentality to come out and be physical and they believed in what they were doing.” 
After facing criticism in the wake of the Western Michigan game, the defense approached the game with one plan in mind — to attack. The unit packed the box, blitzing heavily to disrupt the Stanford rush game and holding star running back Bryce Love to only 168 rushing yards, most of which came in the first quarter.
Up front, the defensive line was a nightmare, with senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu breaking up four passes, and junior tackle Rasheem Green swatting away another. Senior defensive tackle Josh Fatu wrapped up the lone sack of the night, but most of Stanford quarterback Keller Chryst’s nine incomplete passes were forced by aggressive pressure on the pocket. 
To senior linebacker Cam Smith, the game was an answer to the questions that the first week of play presented to the defensive unit.
“We’re playing really well as a unit,” Smith said. “As a group we clicked really well tonight and we’re going to build confidence off of this game.”
The offense also thrived, especially in the explosive first half, with a wide range of players breaking out for moments in the spotlight. Mitchell hauled in two touchdown catches, notching a career-high 94 receiving yards on the night, while freshman running back Stephen Carr continued to impress with 119 yards of rushing. Darnold went 21-for-26 after completing his first 11 passes, tossing four of the night’s touchdowns. 
Behind a balanced rushing game and improved chemistry between Darnold and his receivers, the Trojans were only scoreless on two drives of the first half.
“The ability for our receivers to make plays when needed … it was huge,” Darnold said. “When [their] opportunity presents itself, they make the most of it. Whenever they get the opportunity to make a big play, they have.”
The second half slowed considerably, as both teams struggled in a scoreless third quarter. Penalties held the Trojans back on both sides of the ball, but the team’s response was positive, with players skipping and dancing to the sidelines to pump the crowd up.
“We take a lot of energy from the fans,” Darnold said. “When our fans come out and are loud it helps us as players to have that energy. We can feed off that and that’s something special you don’t get anywhere else.”
Darnold broke the silence in the fourth quarter, tossing 35 yards to Burnett to put the Trojans within striking range. After rushing for a quarterback keeper, Darnold scrambled and lofted a pass over two defensive backs to hit Mitchell in the back corner of the end zone. The touchdown pushed the lead to 35-17, and fans began to filter out of the stands as the point differential widened.
The Cardinal responded quickly, relying on long passes to cut the lead to 35-24 with seven minutes remaining. But a 22-yard touchdown run by Jones with under five minutes to play in the fourth quarter was enough to put the game away.
DT, come on.  That score was…………?    Looks like the fans were not the only ones filtering out of the stands.

Thirteen seconds. That was all the No. 2 men’s water polo team needed to prove that they are going to be a force to be reckoned with this season as freshman Driver Marko Vavic scored, sending the crowd into a frenzy of excitement. In those 13 seconds, the team established a lead it would hold for the entirety of the game before finishing in an 8-6 victory over No. 3 Stanford.
“It set the tone for the rest of the game” senior goalie McQuin Baron said, “especially as a freshman, hitting that shot. I think it gave him that confidence for the rest of the game. Marko had two or three other shot blocks and two or three goals.”
Vavic, who was actively present both on offense and defense, was not the only player to make a mark. Baron, who finished the game with 12 saves, is climbing closer to taking the title of most career saves at USC, only needing 18 saves to tie it. However, the veteran player is continuing to push himself and has his sights set on improving.
“I set a goal limit for how many goals I want the other opponent to score, which is usually four, so I failed that obviously, but that’s okay,” Baron said. “I think the biggest thing with sports is watching film on your opponents. That’s my biggest preparation when coming into a big game like this.”
The Trojans are now 3-0 for the season and1-0 at home and in conference play. The victory on Friday not only was a confidence booster for the team, but also established that the Uytengsu Aquatics Center will be a place that opponents can always expect a battle for the victory. 
“It is everything. You never want to lose at home,” Baron said. “You never want to give them that advantage, especially when you play them down the road and you play them at their house and they beat you at your house already. You never want to give them that.”
As the first MPSF game of the season, the Trojans had been preparing for this game for a long time. The program has a long history with Stanford, with an overall record of 65-60, including both times the team met last season. However, USC did not let last year’s result change the way it approached this game.
“It was a great game,” Baron said. “I mean, they’re a wonderful team. They red-shirted five or six seniors, so this was a big win for us going into the rest of our season, especially this early in our season knowing that we are a competitive team and that we have what it takes.”
“We have just been waiting for this game to finally come,” Vavic said, “so to actually just get a win was awesome.”
Do you mean “Victory Over Stanford” in the title?

What a difference a week makes.
Seven days ago, in the aftermath of the Trojans squeaking by Western Michigan to open the season, their national championship hopes were dashed, redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold was no longer a Heisman trophy candidate and Stanford was going to march into the Coliseum to pummel them in Week 2 — supposedly.
After all, if USC struggled to contain Western Michigan’s run game, and Stanford had arguably a better offensive line and run game than the Broncos, then surely the Trojans would be no match for the Cardinal, right? At least, that’s the conclusion most college football pundits — including myself — came to last week. And in the process, we all underestimated Western Michigan, were too quick to panic at USC’s slip out of the gates and were pleasantly surprised when the Trojans suddenly switched to beast mode in a 42-24 win over Stanford on Saturday at the Coliseum.
The Week 1 overreaction was not lost on players, even after the big win.
“I don’t think the media really realized that Western Michigan is a real team,” junior linebacker Porter Gustin said.
If Western Michigan wasn’t a real team, then make no mistake: Stanford was a real team. The Cardinal came into the Coliseum ranked 14th in the country, fresh off two weeks of rest following a 62-7 beatdown of Rice in their season opener and ready to extend the good times in Los Angeles — Stanford had won seven of its last 10 games against USC and four of the last five at the Coliseum. And though notorious USC killer Christian McCaffrey was no longer on the roster to terrorize the Trojans, he had a formidable replacement in running back Bryce Love, who was bound to give USC fits on the ground.
So it was entirely plausible to give Stanford the edge heading into the game. The betting spread right before kickoff was just minus-4.5 in favor of USC, which is close to nothing considering the home team usually gets a 3-point cushion. Essentially, it would be a toss-up, and the Cardinal had a lot going for them, from history being on their side to a strong run game to being well-rested.
But the one thing they didn’t have was a dynamic quarterback. Keller Chryst is no Sam Darnold, and the Trojans’ quarterback, like the rest of the team, woke up on Saturday and shut up all the critics. His stats were of the video-game variety that we became accustomed to seeing from him last season. Darnold completed his first 11 passes, finishing 21-of-26 for 316 yards and four touchdowns — those numbers would get him selected first overall in any NFL draft. Unlike last week, when he looked out-of-sync with his receivers, taking sacks and throwing incompletions, Darnold moved around like a slinky, eluding pressure, running around, throwing deep balls and doing whatever it is that makes him so good.
“Great job by this guy,” head coach Clay Helton said, patting Darnold several times on the arm during the postgame press conference, “creating over and over and over. His ability to create and keep his eyes downfield was phenomenal.”
Of course, it helped that the Trojans’ run game — perhaps their lone bright spot in Week 1 — continued to excel against the Cardinal, opening up time and space for Darnold to operate. Freshman running back Stephen Carr and junior running back Ronald Jones II both ran for over 100 yards, with Jones scoring two touchdowns. Freshman Vavae Malepeai and junior Aca’Cedric Ware also chipped in, giving USC a four-pronged attack on the ground that few programs possess. In fact, Malepeai and Ware — the third and fourth options — could easily be No. 1 or No. 2 backs on other Pac-12 teams, but the Trojans are just that loaded at the position.
The running back situation serves as a metaphor for what the Trojans could be this season – talented and deep with sky-high potential. Helton said Saturday’s win “felt like” the most complete game USC had played under his tenure, and it probably was from the standpoint that the Trojans had an equally potent running and passing attack – 316 yards in the air and 307 yards on the ground – and the defense shut down the Cardinal when it mattered most in the second half, limiting Stanford to just seven points after halftime. After a poor performance on both sides of the line against Western Michigan, the Trojans saw vast improvement on Saturday, with the offensive line giving Darnold time to work his magic and the defensive line closing up gaps and pressuring Chryst.
However satisfying it was, though, this win shouldn’t be worth much of a celebration for USC. Not for a team now ranked fourth in the country, with national championship aspirations and a Heisman candidate under center. Not for a team that saw its hype train slow down considerably and its season nearly derailed in Week 1. Not for a team without a week off this season that, as the Pac-12 favorites,  will surely get every opponent’s best shot. 
“The thing we proved is we played to our standard,” Helton said.
On Saturday, we saw the USC team that we expected to see, that we will need to see every week if it is to compete for a national title.

The USC Thornton Symphony took the stage at Bovard Auditorium on Friday, filling the air with notes both tragic and victorious. Titled “The Triumph of Life,” the concert included symphonic works by two heralded composers: Allegro maestoso from Symphony No. 2 in C Minor by Gustav Mahler and Symphony No. 5, Op. 100 in B-flat Major by Sergei Prokofiev.
To Jonathan Sie, a second year master’s student studying trombone performance, the title was the perfect way to express the power of music. 
“With all the emotion that goes on in the music, we’re really just saying something that can’t be said in words,” Sie said. “It’s the triumph that we have as humans, to participate in this unique craft.”
The concert was dedicated to the memory of Emeritus Professor and former Director of Conducting Studies Daniel Lewis, making the sentiments of its title fitting for several reasons. The spirit of the late professor was felt early and often in the auditorium, with Thornton School of Music Dean Robert Cutietta kicking off the evening with a few words of remembrance for the beloved musician. 
Resident conductor Sharon Lavery said she had the honor of working with Lewis at an international conducting workshop in Connecticut, and his presence made a big impact on her. She cites his student Jung Ho Pak as her reason for choosing to study at USC, recognizing the talent level of all who had been under Lewis’ tutelage.
“[Lewis] was one of the reasons I decided to pursue conducting as a major,” Lavery said. “I found him to be incredibly motivational. He inspired all of the conductors.”
With Lewis on the mind of audience members throughout the theater, the orchestra launched into a moving performance of Mahler’s second symphony. Punctuating extended stretches of sorrow with brief yet roaring periods of jubilance, it was a dynamic performance from start to finish. 
Conductor Carl St. Clair took charge throughout the evening, directing his orchestra with gusto while ensuring no detail was overlooked. Spending most of the symphony with arms highly animated in tune with the music, he closed with a lengthened pause for silence, remaining motionless while allowing the audience a moment to process what they just heard.
“He can inspire the orchestra in ways that is rarely defined among conductors,” Sie said of St. Clair’s style of conducting. “He has the unique gift for internalizing everything in the music, and then being able to bring out exactly what he wants from every person in the orchestra.”
After leaving the stage during a brief intermission, St. Clair returned to enthusiastic applause and signaled for the start of Prokofiev’s symphony. Written in 1944, the piece was inspired by the then-recent Allied victories in World War II, creating a tone that is optimistic yet still fraught with the turmoils of war. 
Oboist and second year master’s student Theodosia Roussos found parallels between playing in the orchestra and fighting the good fight on the battleground, citing the need to maintain composure in critical situations. 
“Being in an orchestra is a little like being a soldier,” Roussos said.
“You have to be courageous, but really calm under pressure. I try to just feel nothing, so that when I’m playing the music, I can feel everything, and not be distracted by anything that’s going on in my own life.” 
The orchestra performed all four movements from Prokofiev’s symphony, telling a complete story with a full range of emotions. With less tragedy than the previously performed work by Mahler, the audience was held in a state of suspense while the narrative developed, eventually culminating in an explosive peak that validated the journey. 
If the ensuing applause was any indication, it was a masterful performance throughout, and further proof that sometimes, music says far more than words ever could.
This was a magnificent event.

“Can we joke about race in America?” was the leading description to Visions & Voices’ latest event, Stand-ups Speak Out. The answer, as one might expect, was an overwhelming “yes” from one of the most diverse crowds I had ever seen at a USC event. Even comedian Jenny Yang was surprised: “I like diversity but this is too far,” she joked after spending a good four minutes free-styling to the unstable beat of the crowd’s clapping hands. The event was an illustration of how comedy explored race, identity and stereotypes — a refreshing and nuanced idea in the volatile political climate of recent months.
Improv and sketch comedian Dwayne Colbert emceed the show, interjecting with anecdotes about seeing his father naked, and following them up with statements like, “I am not a comedian.”
The show opened with the adorable JR De Guzman, who was easily also the highlight. De Guzman, who hails from the Philippines, used his guitar to deliver some of the most poignant and original jokes of the night. Aside from the staple gag about Asian parents and their hostile relationship with their children’s careers, De Guzman employed his schoolboy charm to confess the disadvantages to living with your parents. The worst of all, he said, is when they tell you that they’re about to have sex: “He was at my doorframe with a wine bottle and he said, ‘JR, go to sleep.’”
De Guzman also addressed issues of racism with the same lovable originality. One of his songs inspired interracial babies everywhere: “You can be the president!” he sang in his vanilla voice. When recounting how he visited Tennessee with his white girlfriend and was met with disapproving bigotry, he launched into a song from the perpetrator’s point of view: “Nobody dates my sisters but me.” The crowd roared.
Yang also delivered a similarly energetic performance that touched on her experience as an Asian American at the predominantly white Swarthmore College and how she felt about the statue of  Confederate General Robert E. Lee being taken down — which was, by the way, “turned on.” Her best moment was a strange bird-sound-cum-mating-call to illustrate how women act when they haven’t seen each other in a while. Her parting message: “Let’s not comment on each other’s bodies.”

David Arnold, although arguably the most famous stand-up of the group, was a disappointment. He had his moments — for instance, when he stated that “white people have been lying their whole life” and received many a hoot in response. However, it seemed as if he spent half of his set telling the audience to relax, relax again, and that no one gives a f— about white people. In a word, he was dripping with a certain cool guy attitude that got old extremely fast.
Finally, there was Priyanka Wali: a fellow Trojan, practicing physician and in her own words, “a down ass b—- who likes to kick ass.” Wali honed in on practically everything that is funny about being Indian: her grandparents’ arranged marriage, Indian dating websites and how you have to select a skin tone on page two of your profile (the shades are grouped by bread — wheaty, toasty and so on). 
After creating an account for herself on shaadi.com without a single picture and the aforementioned personality description, Wali recounted how she got email, after email, after email — one from a father looking for a match for his son. Yes, it was the staple Indian joke, but Wali had an infectious presence that made even the stern old man next to me giggle. 
 
Thanks for the write-up and review, Kanak! Just want to clarify for the record my quote in the first paragraph (“I like diversity but this is too far”) was presented out of context and I did not imply we’ve literally gone too far in having this event. I love predominantly “diverse” spaces and performance events. Thanks!

Dear Asian Americans: It’s time to check our privilege. 
Sometimes, we all have the feeling that the world is going insane. This past week — especially in the wake of Hurricane Irma, the impending Hurricane Jose nearing the Caribbean islands, the 8.1 magnitude earthquake that shook southern Mexico and the political turmoil currently disrupting American society — I find it futile to write about myself and my struggles. (Note: I am not depressed; I’m simply melodramatic.)
My problems don’t compare to those of the people affected by natural disasters or the undocumented individuals who face even more uncertainty in their daily lives. 
Last Tuesday, as President Donald Trump formally rescinded the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, I realized the position of privilege I lived in as an American citizen and how that privilege can easily be translated into willful ignorance through a decisive lack of action. 
The DACA program has been a beacon of hope for 800,000 undocumented individuals — and possibly to even more of those who were seeking to apply. As an American citizen, I lacked exposure to and education about challenges facing immigrants in the U.S. naturalization process growing up. It was easy to think that the conversation surrounding DACA applies only to people unlike myself: a Vietnamese American, born and raised in the United States. 
To Americans who are not of Asian descent, the word Asian American conjures up a specific image — arguably, a stereotype — of an individual. Asian American identities, however, are so uniquely complex and multifaceted that this categorization of a group of people who stem from the large Asian continent is unfair. The description fails to discount the economic disparities and, in some cases, hostilities between ethnic groups.
All the talk surrounding the Asian American community as successful, high-achieving and hardworking further disguises the reality that we are America’s fastest-growing immigrant group, with some emigrating from poor, second-world nations that lack sufficient resources to promote higher education. According to AAPI Data, about 1.6 million of the 11 million undocumented people living in the United States are Asians — and it’s frustrating to not see the Asian American community condemn a detrimental political action that destabilizes the future of its own undocumented youth.
Asian Americans have been silent, remaining on the sidelines of politics, for far too long. Although we are not as immersed in the conversation around illegal immigration as Latinos are or as profiled by the color of our skin as African Americans, we are not exempt from the same institutional barriers that they face. 
The Migration Policy Institute estimates that Asians made up 10 percent of the population eligible for DACA enrollment. Although the bulk of DACA recipients originate from Mexico and other Latin American nations, a sizable number of recipients hail from South Korea, the Philippines, India and other Asian countries.
On Thursday, the USC Latina/o Student Assembly hosted a Defend DACA rally on campus to protest the White House’s announcement. Considering the aforementioned statistics, why, then, were no Asian American assemblies present to protest this issue?
And generally, why do so few Asian Americans advocate for political issues? Why are we not willing to condemn injustices within and outside our community? Why do we hesitate to stand in solidarity with other movements?
Many of our parents were immigrants to the United States and were barely able to navigate the sociopolitical potholes of the system; therefore, it was almost impossible for them to be advocates in political movements they didn’t understand. 
This generation is now responsible for the next wave of Asian American activism, but it’s disappointing to see our lack of political participation and advocacy compared to our minority counterparts. 
It’s time for Asian Americans to check our privilege — the privilege of silence and willful ignorance that has coined us the phrase “model minority.” 
Terry Nguyen is a sophomore majoring in journalism and political science. She is also the news assignments editor of the Daily Trojan. Her column, “Fémmoirs,” runs every other Monday. 
 
DACA, as it was implemented, is unconstitutional. If you want it, it cannot be an executive order. It must be legislation.
LOL! You’re trying too hard. You need to take the red pill.
Social justice activism is dominated by non-Asians, so Asians are expected to support other races while they get attacked for supporting their own causes (eg: SCA5). Because Asians are seen as “privileged”, they are constantly told their problems are non-existent or don’t matter.
Terry Nguyen sees nothing wrong in stereotyping Asians as a model minority and calling them “privileged” yet if someone stereotyped Blacks as musical and athletic and called them “privileged”, she would quickly turn around and condemn that as racist. People like the author are part of the problem.
I wonder if Asian Americans — like people of other races — do not get politically involved because there are divisions not only among Asian groups (E Asian, SE Asian, S Asian)…but because there is a division in how much we support other POC.  
Whether we Asian Americans support other POC sometimes seems to break down like this:  
(1) “if my family, Asian friends, or I were discriminated against, bullied or worse by Group X, then Group X is my biggest threat and biggest enemy, bigger than Group Y.”  
(2) “those of you who ally with Group Y, why don’t you look at how Group X bullies/discriminates against/kills Asians too”
Generally, I find the lack of empathy in the Asian American community toward other races is quite disturbing. It is saddening that older generation of Asian immigrants refused to speak out for what they believe in  because they are afraid that it would no long make the the “model minority.” That is the problem with Asian American community; they are afraid of criticism and feedback. Younger generations should change that because the community should face the reality as a whole rather than keeping up our pride and reputation.
This is preposterous

“Can anyone think of an application of cultural psychology in examining the results of an individual’s Brief Sensation-Seeking Scale score?” 
My psychology professor admirably maintained a high level of energy as she projected her question, despite seeing the tired faces of the 200+ students barely keeping awake as the lecture period neared its end. Despite my own exhaustion as I completed my eighth hour of lecture for the day, I thought about the question. The Brief Sensation-Seeking Scale score predicts how likely a person is to seek exciting, new things, and to participate in high-thrill activities. Cultural psychology is the branch studying the ways in which our cultures shape us. As I formulated a potential answer, I heard a soft chuckle and a whisper, that even a week and a half later makes my blood boil: “Muslims are more violent because their religion tells them they should be.”
We are, unfortunately, a society of extremes. Our availability heuristic heavily influences our cognition. For example, when criticizing the opposing political side, Democrats can be quick to include all Republicans under the “alt-right” category, and Republicans are quick to see all liberals as the “alt-left”. The term “moderate” has come to be meaningless. 
Similarly, we too easily divide society into two extreme categories: those who are racist, and those who are not. We tend to see the former as individuals who scream racial slurs in public and openly criticize immigrants for the sake of filling media minutes. On the other hand, we perceive those we have deemed “not racists” through idealistic, rose-tinted glasses as people who are accepting of all cultures and see everyone as an equal.
But if not a legitimate answer I could write down in my notes, the horrific words that escaped the lips of the group of young white men sitting in the row behind me gave me perspective. Their insensitivity shone a light on a kind of silent racism, which is only practiced behind closed doors and therefore unknown to anyone else. They introduced me to the racism spectrum, with a middle ground that is characterized by a facade of acceptance that we have been tricked into believing is reality. This is an array of people who perceive themselves as culturally accepting, but in reality foster an attitude arguably as devastating than that of individuals who shout racial slurs in public. 
For the sake of simplifying this rather complicated issue and fitting this argument in my page limit, let’s use the analogy of the visible light spectrum to explain racism. If we define outwardly racist people as “violets,” then we can define those who are fully accepting of others as the “reds.” The topic of investigation is the range of blues, greens, yellows and oranges that fall in between the two extremes. 
There are the men in my psychology lecture — the blues and greens — who speak ill of the backgrounds and cultures of their  “ethnic friend” (as they term them), but parade around with these same friends as if to say, “I’m hanging out with Sanjay and Osamah, I can’t be racist.” And we as a society have fallen into their trap. We applaud their behavior and use this mindset as a basis to label them as members of the latter group. 
However, this spectrum contains individuals who are inadvertently racist, passing comments that reveal their almost innocent insensitivity — the yellows and oranges. These are the people who are quick to say, “Well in America, we say ____”, when an international friend uses a different term for an object. For example, 
These are also some of the people who jump to the first #DefendDACA rally on campus because they believe President Donald Trump’s decision to end this Obama-administration program will lead to the deportation of their international friends — they fail to differentiate between international students and the individuals protected under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, viewing all of their “ethnic friends” as a homogeneous group (I could launch into a grand explanation of this difference, but to avoid exploring a tangent with no return, I recommend performing a Google search). We see their support for an important cause, and are blindsided to the flaws in their logic. 
But one might ask, how are we supposed to distinguish between the violets, blues, yellows and reds? Unfortunately, we can’t. Doing this would inevitably result in yet another trap of abandoning all trust in humanity and automatically assuming that even reds are secretly blues. Not only would this further all the existing unrest around race relations in society, but it could also push us further away from the solution. 
Instead, the solution is found within each individual person. We must ask ourselves if we have even unintentionally made a comment with racist undertones. We must ask ourselves when we have asked that an international student change her vocabulary so it is easier for us to comprehend, instead of making the effort to instead understand their terminology. 
Not only are these “middle” people unaware of other cultures and facts, but they are also blindsided to their own ignorance. And ignorance of your own ignorance is only a temporary, fragile bliss.
Nithya Rajeev is a sophomore majoring in human biology. Her column,“The Spectrum,” runs every other Monday.
The author says:  “this spectrum contains individuals who are inadvertently racist, passing comments that reveal their almost innocent insensitivity — the yellows and oranges. These are the people who are quick to say, “Well in America, we say ____”, when an international friend uses a different term for an object.”
So I’ve been racist towards my British friends by telling them that we say “eraser”, not “rubber”, and “trunk”  instead of “boot”?  I feel so ashamed.
Nithya, there have been 5 Islamic terror attacks in Europe in the last 2 days, are you completely sure that the guys sitting behind you are wrong? Do you know what’s happening in Sweden? I think you’re going to have to come to grips with the fact that the Koran really does specifically, repeatedly order that innocent people be harmed to spread Islam.
Not accepting a culture is NOT equivalent to racism.
I understand the sentiment of this article, and the author makes several good points about heuristics. However, it is important to note that criticizing a culture is not the equivalent of criticizing a race. Criticizing Islam for its flaws is not the same as criticizing people based exclusively on their skin tone. Any cultural practice should not be beyond scrutiny. Bad behavior is bad behavior. Violence promoted by Islam is bad behavior. By the same token, pedophiles protected by the Catholic Church is bad behavior. Criticism is entirely valid on both of these cultural institutions and should not be misconstrued as a criticism tied directly to race.
Red pill.
So if I don’t embrace radical Islam and open borders which color in the spectrum am I?
Open borders has become a relatively new, liberal concept. You view that conservatively, thinking it better that the US control its borders, as it has, for better or worse, since WW I.
“Radical” means extreme liberal. You do not favor that, so again, you are thinking conservatively.
Your thinking is conservative, and so, is it bad? No, not to me. To accept open borders and radical Islam as desirable, in my view, would be a nihilistic, unthinking wish for national self-destruction.
I agree, Lunderful. Great comment. The few thousand KKK, American Nazis and White Supremacist cult members are a regrettable part of our population of 325 million. Yet their loud vitriol gains them great attention and much wailing over “widespread racism in our country.” Yes, our country has some, but some excitable people take the fringe mentioned above as representative of the country as a whole. Not the case, but as you wrote, their noise is loud. For some, that is enough.
My original point below is that after hundreds of hours of the media, instructors, clergy and other people endlessly and repetitively lecturing about racism, a person who is not racist can get sick of the tiresome and insulting accusations. But if one mutters “enough, already!” then others may condemn that impatient person as a “racist.”
Unless you don’t understand how white supremacy is one of the foundations of this country, and that the resultant systemic and individual racism affects people of color, then I guess one would get tired of hearing about racism…
NONSENSICAL RAVINGS OF A LUNATIC MUCH? IS MEXICO A MEXICAN SUPREMACY? IS CHINA A CHINESE SUPREMACY? IS INDIA INDIAN SUPREMACY? YOU MAKE THE WAY CIVILIZATIONS HAVE BEEN CREATED ALL OVER THE ENTIRE WORLD FOR ALL OF HISTORY NORMAL EXCEPT IN WHITE COUNTRIES WHERE IT IS AN ABOMINATION! HAHA YOUR HISTORICAL ILLITERACY TAKEN FROM BLACK SUPREMACIST NONSENSE IS COMICAL AT BEST!
You’re commenting in all caps. I think that’s enough for me to understand that you’re not equipped to have this discussion.
Correct. White supremacy, certainly as seen in the ugly, inhuman and evil institution of slavery, was one of the foundations of our country.. That ended more than 150 years ago. But yes, some people in our country unfortunately do have nasty racist attitudes, so unfair racial discrimination survives.
But you missed my point. I agree that education on this evil can be very helpful and needs to be pursued diligently and for many years to come, if we are to solve the problem.
My point is those who are not racist, who understand how racism viciously impacts people of color, and who understand the need for continuing education – can get impatient with a lesson already well learned but constantly repeated. At that point, it seems personally insulting and upsetting to hear “you are a racist and you need to do this and this and not that.”
Unfortunately, you’re not understanding how white supremacy works. White supremacy, as the foundation, begets systemic and individual racism. So you have a pseudo science backed by racist ideas of the lack of humanity in non-whites. Slavery was simply public policy based on white supremacy, which is why when slavery was ended, the white supremacist public policy simply adapted with Black Codes and then Jim Crow segregation. Again, racism is the visible tumor to the white supremacy cancer. So while it is quite easy to believe that it’s individuals who are ‘evil’ or ‘racist,’ (or a subset of whiteness: rednecks, KKK, Nazis, Mississippians…anyone who fits the stereotype of a white racist…hence an obviously bad person) the reality is that all white Americans benefit from a white supremacist system that’s implemented institutionally and systemically. 
So for example, you have the FHA making loans for over 40 years to whites at a 98% clip, while denying the same loans to blacks at around the same rate. One group is able to build equity, stable neighborhoods, use rising property taxes to fund schools, while the other group rents, is prevented from integrating white areas through intimidation or redlining or block busting (which spurs white flight and the flight of real estate value) and eventually the accumulation of wealth. How white supremacy works is that whites think that getting an FHA loan is par for the course, and that their newly won middle class status was earned, while never noticing that the black group was prevented, even if they were on the same level, from attaining the same benefits. Where does racism come in? If you’ve come to believe that black are a series of negative stereotypes, then you can rationalize and justify their place in society, while rejecting the evidence that says discrimination helped one group and hurt another. 
The point is that most white Americans aren’t racist, but they’re not anti-racist either. They hold a middle group of non-racist, where they take no proactive action to recognize the systemic issues of white supremacy and racism, but instead rely upon individual morality as the ultimate arbiter of whether or not racism is a thing. To be called upon to deal with racism suddenly becomes a tiresome thing, as though dealing with actual racism isn’t the true problem. It’s a privilege that white Americans hold in that they came be as race averse as they’d like, while people of color wake up every day navigating a world where they fight white supremacy as a societal problem, while also tackling the individual racist realities, while also fighting to succeed like any other American. 
For students of color, dealing with campus racism is typically their first true understanding of how American society works. And it’s a hard reality. If you’d like to know more about campus racism, I just so happened to write a book on it: Blackballed: The Black and White Politics of Race on America’s Campuses. It will open your eyes to what this young woman so eloquently recounted.
Thank you. Much better stated, much clearer! Your last two paragraphs are especially relevant, much more to the point. Generalities about any given white individual might not apply, because that person could be free of bigotry and racial prejudice. Even if so, if I understand you, that for such an individual, a benign, passive attitude does not make for a solution. Instead, one must make an affirmative, constructive response to overcoming racism, whether personal, organization or societal. Thanks, Alpha.
With all due respect Alpha1906, you and the black community are not the sole targets of racist behavior over the course of our history in the USA.  How can you hold folks accountable for behavior their ancestors exhibited?  Just about every society on the planet at some time or another held slaves in one form or another.  Even in Africa, there were slaves who were owned by black African slave owners. The Jews were slaves to the Egyptians and others for thousands of years. They don’t demand reparations. They don’t push their history in your face. The Jews rose to the occasion and made a better life for themselves and their children so that the children could live a better life than the one they had.
Even this “white dude” as you have so ungraciously called us has been a  target of racists perversions.  Growing up with a jewish last name and going to Catholic School created it’s own problems. I learned to fight on the playground, and hated every moment of it, but that’s life. I am not bitter.
Going to Jewish COmmunity Center summer camps and being the only non-jew in the the camp presented its own problems. I learned to fight in the camp grounds and woods of the greater Chesapeake Bay and Tidewater locales of Norfolk, VA.  I am not bitter.
Always being the new kid on the block and in school, because we moved every 2-4 years, as my dad was a US Naval Aviator, 20 year man, I learned to fight in the backyards of my neighbors.  I am not bitter.
Spending summers on Kauai with my mother’s family and being the only haole in the area and being picked on by the locals, some of whom were my cousins; I had to learn to fight on the beaches of Kauai.  I am not bitter.
The moral of the story is this: You make you own destiny young man.  Yes, you may have had some serious community issues in your younger days, perhaps not, but today, the plight of the black community rests soley on the community leadership or lack of it.  I do not own your racist views. I am not responsible for your racist experiences.  You own it. You deal with it. You make the best of what life throws at you.  I lived in the South for 12 years and in Hawaii for many years and if you want to see poor, go there.  But the hatred that you pursue is uncalled for and ionly promotes the problems in this country.  What I and perhaps others on this thread would like to hear from you would be;
What do you propose to help make your community a better place to live for young black children?
What role models are you using in your talks with young black kids about whom to model their life from?
What are your peers doing to promote love and peace within your lives and communities?
And BLM is not the answer, as they are more of the problem.
I stopped succumbing to the liberal politics of white guilt a long time ago.  The country has done more for the black community over the past 60 years than any other group of citizens, and folks like you still work to divide the country.  Next thing you’ll want is financial reparations from what happened 150 years ago.  Ain’t gonna happen.
For one, you again do not understand how white supremacy works. You think that racism is something that happened ‘in the past’ by someone’s ‘ancestors.’ That’s not how it works. White supremacy is one of the foundations of this country, so you’re living with that fact as we speak today. No need to look to ‘ancestors,’ you instead need to understand that this white supremacy begets systemic and individual racism that you see in society today. It manifests itself in how institutions throughout society benefit white Americans for the most part, while creating situations where people of color have to fight for the same rights. 
I’m trying to figure out where you got that I said that blacks were the sole target of racism in this country. White supremacy is about benefiting white Americans and not treating non-whites as human, so you get: the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, Jim Crow laws against black, Mexicans, and Asians in California, Japanese American Concentration camps, restrictive mortgage covenants, etc. etc. etc. I think in your zeal to create a red herring about why white supremacy isn’t responsible for creating a system of racism, you started throwing out a hodgepodge things, just to see if anything sticks. 
African sold slaves. True. However, chattel slavery in the Americas is different than any other human slavery in history in that enslaved Africans were treated as property. Which by its very nature means that they were looked upon as not being human, which means that this country has often not considered it necessary to treat us as human beings. So the fact that Africans sold slaves does nothing to negate the fact that the brutality and inhumanity of white supremacy created a system of racism that we live with today. 
I would go through the rest of your statement, but basically it boils down to the common answer you get from white Americans who fail to understand white supremacy, and who do not want to change it. You fall into a common notion that African Americans are somehow paralyzed by a society in which white supremacy and systemic racism is underlying policy of the land. We’re not. The miracle of miracles is that in an America where everyone is striving to achieve, African Americans still achieve DESPITE the hurdles of white supremacy…or the paternalism of white Americans who think that the country ‘has done more for blacks over the past 60 years’ as though African Americans are interlopers and are not part of’ ‘this country.’  Which goes back to the point that if your mindset is that blacks are not truly human, then how can they be part of ‘this country?’
Lastly, and I’ll end here: If you think that Black Lives Matter, which fights to make sure that black lives are counted and strives to end police brutality against the black community, is the problem, then you’ve instantly put yourself on the side of police brutality and white supremacy. Which tells me that you just might need a few more black role models in your life…other than musicians and athletes, to explain to you how this old American system works.
OK. You win. I give up. I’m too stupid to understand. I confess that by your logic, I surely must be a racist. But nonetheless, I wish you well and can only hope and pray for the day when the scourge of racism, its actions and its mean, twisted, thinking, will pass.
My last comment actually wasn’t directed at you, but at TheKatman…
The “extreme” elements in American society are insignificant – albeit, often loud.  Don’t confuse noise with significance.
So sorry that Nithya had to endure the racist comments of those students behind her. Racist comments have no place at USC. Not sure what the psych professor was saying at the time, though. If the instruction had become a rant or a tiresome, redundant harangue, though, the students behind Nithya may have been merely fed up and impatient with what has become repetitive, tiresome and even insulting to those who are not racists.
I have heard students fellow students respond impatiently to such lectures with muttered negative, racist-seeming comments, although they are not racists. “Not racists? Then why would they make negative comments?”
Because it becomes tiresome and irritating to be admonished, chided, and lectured on something one already believes, in this case, the need to regard others fairly and not by race. I hope that is what happened that day in class, and those students behind Nithya were merely fed up and impatient with an old, constant theme, and not truly racists or haters.
I find both the writers connection and your comment’s connection with that of criticizing a religion as being equal to an attack on a ethnic group disturbing.This is a very dangerous insinuation that must be met head on. The very idea and first principle of this article is that committing blasphemy or criticizing a religion and the followers of a religion founded by an illiterate businessman is an attack on some race or ethnic group is preposterous. That a criticism I have of Christianity is not an attack on white Europeans or attacking the Orthodox church is not an act of racism against Armenians. Why is that a religion of 1.5 billion people, whose followers are “Muslims” as followers of Christ are “Christians” must be protected. If they say Islam projects violence in the modern era they are right. After all the religion claims to the last and final revelation, in the countries where its’ teachings are followed by theocratic fascist regimes we have the subjugation of women as slaves, the stoning and killing of apostates and homosexuals and the proposal to denounce Jew’s as second class citizens. If I say “Christians” are dumb for wanting to be against the use of condoms, which in Africa would do miracles for the AIDs epidemic there, I am not accused of being “racist” or bigoted. In fact that opinion is applauded, but if I say as I may that the Islamic world has since its inception projected violence and without a renaissance will continue to do so I am racist. For what? I am simply criticizing a religion, though not as well articulated, those two men were pointing out a problem with Islam. For this author and you to equate this with racism is morally and intellectually irresponsible and only shows how far the termites have spread. And as Islam and its apologists spread around the world how much longer may I be able to read “The Satanic Verses” and criticize their archaic religion and its followers before its replaced with “The Protocals of the Elders of Zion” and me being exiled for being an atheist. 
It doesn’t matter how well it is articulated. They could make it soundly and with good evidence or they could do something as draw a cartoon or make a slide comment as they did. There is no substantive difference in the critique.
Tyler:  Please clarify your main point. I am trying to understand, but am confused. 
Opposition to the concepts of radical Islamism is not based on intellectual philosophy, but on perception to its unmistakeably violent, murderous practices. And no, that is not “racism,” because radical Islamists are not a “race,” but followers of an extremist version of a religion.
That much I get, I think. Please go on from there and identify your main point.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
Last week, Hurricane Harvey unleashed devastation unseen for a decade on the Houston area. This week, Hurricane Irma began closing in on Florida, causing communities throughout southern Florida to evacuate. With dozens dead and untold property damage, the full costs of Hurricane Harvey and now, Irma, will not be known for years to come. Recent projections paint a bleak picture. 
According to The New York Times, most disaster and risk management experts predict the full economic cost of Hurricane Harvey to be between $70 to $108 billion — putting it on track to be either the first or second most expensive weather catastrophe on record in the United States. Other experts are even less optimistic. Joel Myers of weather forecasting service Accuweather, for example, projects that the hurricane may cost the American economy upwards of $190 billion.
Living in California, it is easy to sympathize with the situation in Houston, while largely ignoring it. But this is a grave mistake: Hurricane Harvey illustrates the terrifying future of extreme weather patterns that the Los Angeles area will face in the coming years.  
Southern California, particularly Orange and Los Angeles counties, is a largely coastal region prone to flooding. Though not threatened by hurricanes, California’s southern coast nonetheless faces seasonal storms and flash floods. As climate change disrupts weather patterns and causes more severe events, the area remains vulnerable.
Research Professor Alan Rose, who works at the Sol Price School of Public Policy, told the Daily Breeze that “the number of high-level rain events are likely to increase from climate change.” And with this greater volume of rain, comes a greater possibility of disastrous flooding. 
Rose’s research found that the consequences of flooding caused by a catastrophic storm or tsunami hitting Southern California would be immense. In fact, Rose said, “The loss estimates for a severe atmospheric river storm are larger than our estimates for catastrophic earthquake.” The effects of such a disaster would be felt across the entire state and even the nation. 
For those skeptical of the possibility of a devastating storm hitting California, look no further than the so-called Great Flood of 1961 through 1962. As Salon reports, the flooding was so severe that the Central Valley was reduced to a lake — with the Los Angeles Basin and much of Orange County completely immersed in water. 
This occurred before the region was heavily populated or climate change was creating more severe weather patterns. If a flood of similar magnitude occurred now, it would be much more costly. Rose’s research indicates that the damage to infrastructure would cost upwards of $100 billion to repair. 
The effects on Los Angeles alone would be devastating. In a recent study, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated a large-scale storm would uproot 50,000 people and inflict $13 billion in property damage. Situated on a series of low-lying estuaries, Orange County would be hit even harder — sustaining around three times more destruction than Los Angeles County.
With such high stakes, local policymakers must step up to the plate. Climate change is not going away, despite the claims of so-called skeptics. While cutting emissions is integral to reversing global warming, localities should take other practical steps to endure such cataclysmic weather events.
At the moment, a patchwork of local governments are in charge of maintaining California’s emergency flood control infrastructure. The disorganization and lack of real funding spent on the issue is striking. As a result, California’s coast is vastly unprepared for increased flooding or a climate disaster.   
To prevent a crisis, the state government must be bold. The legislature should include comprehensive coastal infrastructure modernization in the transportation updates funded by the recently passed gas tax. Coastal infrastructure is inherently tied up in trade, so ensuring areas like the Port of Los Angeles remain operational even during severe flooding is well within the gas tax’s mandate. New seawalls, sustainable buildings and flood control systems for residential areas would bring these communities up to date with their surroundings.  
If Southern California policymakers do not heed the warnings of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, we as a region will be vulnerable. One day soon, extreme weather patterns will come to Los Angeles. When they do, we must be ready.

To help foster a more peaceful and mindful environment on campus, a new student organization is working to provide techniques to alleviate stress and promote healthy lifestyles among the USC community. 
The Music Meditation Club was founded by Jaya Chaitanya Das, a former hip-hop producer. Das originally had the idea to create this student group to combine two elements — music and meditation — to improve students’ overall mental health. 
“I’m showing the ways that people can cope with stress through music therapy,” Das said. “I want to address these things especially because there are high rates of stress and anxiety in colleges these days. I want to give [students] an alternative through meditation to help alter their lifestyle, awareness and consciousness.” 
Prior to receiving his position as a chaplain on campus and creating this club, Das devoted much of his life to traveling to different monasteries throughout India and in the United States. 
The club meets every Monday from 6 to 9 p.m. at the University Religious Center, and the meetings are generally accompanied by vegan desserts, guest speakers, discussions and group meditations. 
“We aim to involve music and meditation,” graduate student and club president Vibhanshu Sharma said. “Although there are a lot of meditation techniques out there, Jaya and I thought of bringing these two together because music has a significant impact. Music can bring us down if we hear sad music, or it can be romantic and really cheer us up.”
At the last club meeting, more than 80 students showed up. The class began with guided breathing and yoga and then continued with a panel discussion. Filmmaker and self-published author Koi Fresco was then introduced as a special guest and spoke about how he dealt with his recent car accident and how spirituality and meditation helped him overcome the physical and emotional pain. 
The meeting was then concluded with a meditation session to the beat of musical instruments. The session attracted a diverse group of students, ranging from those who were familiar with meditation to those who were completely new to the practice. 
“I got into these existential questions since my freshman year in high school and I’ve been mulling those ever since,” said Garrett Flynn, a freshman majoring in computational neuroscience. “I’ve listened to a lot of lectures on YouTube and tried to incorporate as many practices as I could, on my own. But a lot of the times the motivation wasn’t there, so it’s nice to be able to go and meet with a community who are also interested in the same things, because it helps hold yourself accountable.”
Das hopes to educate students about the variety of methods to cope with stress through philosophy, mindful eating, guided breathing, yoga and mantra meditation. Each of these techniques helps improve one’s health through various methods and has a specialized purpose. 
“Yoga is for your physical health, guided breathing is for your mental health and mantra meditation is for your spiritual health,” Das said. “Guided breathing is being more aware of your breath. We take about 20,000 breaths a day, but how are we aware of just a few of them? It helps you become more aware and helps you focus on the moment.” 
Although all of the methods are important and useful, according to Das, the organization heavily emphasizes the ancient practice of mantra meditation. The Sanskrit word “mantra” can be split into two — “man” means mind and “trai” means free, literally translating to “freeing the mind through sound,” Das said. 
The method involves three steps: to chant, focus and repeat. According to a mantra meditation guide Das passed out, the first step is to chant the three names of “Hare,” “Krishna” and “Rama” to create a spiritual sound vibration. Next, the key is to focus on the words of the chant to create a transcendental feeling and to revive one’s consciousness. Finally, students are encouraged to repeat the chant and to make it a regular daily practice to promote relaxation. 
“Being a graduate student myself, we have a lot of stress not only in terms of course curriculum and workload, but also in terms of jobs, internships and personal life,” Sharma said. “You need to learn how to balance and manage everything together so I personally feel like this [mantra meditation] is something people would like because everyone feels these kinds of hardships.”
 Das plans to invite more guest speakers in the field of yoga and meditation to help teach and deliver to the students, such as the founder of Def Jam Recordings Russell Simmons, singer Lana Del Rey and former YouTuber Kevin Wu, also known as KevJumba. 
For its future plans, the USC Music Meditation Club aspires to continue spreading the importance of handling stress in a safe way through meditation and other ancient practices through the campus, Das said.

At the wake of updated immigration policies and the recission of DACA, the Gould Immigration Clinic will begin offering free programs for citizenship and naturalization assistance for members of the USC community in mid-to-late September, Provost Michael Quick first announced the program in a memo on Aug. 31. 
The clinic will offer seven free citizenship orientation workshops from Sept. 19 to Sept. 23, on both the University Park Campus and the Health Sciences Campus. As of Tuesday, approximately 165 people have signed up for at least one of the workshops, said Jennifer Macias, a staff attorney at the clinic. 
“We have become aware that services for permanent residents who are eligible for naturalized citizenship are underutilized in our community,” Quick said in the memo, which was also signed by Senior Vice President of Administration Todd Dickey and Senior Vice President of University Relations Thomas Sayles. “We hope to increase awareness and utilization of the citizenship naturalization process for our faculty, students, staff and their families, as well as our neighbors.”
In California alone, about 2.2 million adults are eligible to naturalize, and about a third of those are Los Angeles County residents, according to a 2016 study by the Dornsife Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration. 
According to Niels Frenzen, director of the clinic, the center’s studies on naturalization helped to inform the University’s decision to provide resources for these residents within the USC community. 
“USC, as a large employer in Los Angeles County, [has] a lot of staff members and there are doubtlessly thousands of [eligible-to-naturalize adults] on our staff,” Frenzen said. “It certainly includes faculty. It certainly includes students.”
In addition to aiding USC community members, the Immigration Clinic has offered free naturalization assistance for the general public since January, through funding from the California Department of Social Services and the USC Office of the Provost, according to the Gould Immigration Clinic website. 
Throughout his time in office, President Donald Trump has increased deportations of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. Permanent U.S. residents are still at risk of deportation under current immigration law, despite their current status as legal non-citizens.
“The best defense against removal is being a U.S. citizen,” Frenzen said. 
He added that allowing the naturalization process is an important step for eligible immigrants. 
According to U.S. Immigration and Citizenship Services, an individual is eligible for naturalization if they’ve been a permanent resident in the United States for five years, or three years if they are the spouse of a U.S. citizen. If they are under 18 years old, they can be eligible for naturalization if one of their parents is a U.S. citizen. 
To become naturalized, individuals must complete an application, interview process and exam to ensure that they are able to read, write and speak English and have an understanding of U.S. history and government.
To aid with the process, the Immigration Clinic will offer free sessions in October and December to aid in completing and screening naturalization applications. It will also provide free individual legal assistance for those with more complex naturalization cases. USC employees can enroll in 12-week courses in English and civics to prepare for the naturalization exams and interviews for free, while students and other community members can enroll in these classes for a fee of about $50, Frenzen said. 
Andrea Avila, a graduate student studying public policy, is currently going through the naturalization process with the help of the Immigration Clinic. She came to the United States when she was 12 years old, and became undocumented when she overstayed her visa. When she was 20 years old, she married a U.S. citizen and became a legal permanent resident. Now, she is looking to become a citizen through naturalization. 
“The application is very invasive in terms of your life — [it asks for] any trip you ever had and any organization that you’ve been a part of, so it took me trying to remember every single little thing that I had done and just making sense of all of it,” Avila said. “It made it easier to have someone who knew about the process to help me go through everything and put it into a cohesive application.” 
Having an on-campus clinic also made getting help much more convenient for Avila. 
“There are other venues to do the naturalization process, but I would’ve had to go out of my way to go to those places,” Avila said. “While having it here on campus, I can just take a break after class and go to their office, or just run really quick to ask a question.”
The clinics will be staffed by USC student volunteers. 
“We’re training law students and other students on campus that are interested in volunteering through our project, so they are the ones [helping] complete the naturalization forms at our clinics,” said Dulce Sanchez, program manager of the Immigration Clinic. “Immigration attorneys supervise the students and review the applications before we send them off.”
Beyond the aid it provides for naturalization, the Immigration Clinic provides free consultations and other legal assistance for all cases involving immigration — primarily through the USC Gould Student, Faculty, and Staff Immigrant Legal Advice Project.
Along with the steps already taken to aid the community with immigration issues, Quick’s memo also said that the University plans to “assume national academic leadership” regarding issues of immigration, and it will continue to find ways to provide help for immigrants in the USC community.
