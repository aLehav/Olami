A day after the Nov. 1 deadline for students to receive their flu vaccinations, compliance with the requirement grew by the “hundreds,” Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said in a student health media briefing Tuesday.  
Currently, 55% of undergraduate and graduate students and 70% of professors and staff uploaded their vaccinations. While the deadline has passed, there are no consequences for late submissions, and students can continue to complete Trojan Check without uploading their flu vaccination, Van Orman said.
The University also plans to send email reminders at the end of the week to unvaccinated students. 
“We’ll be starting to remind people that they’re out of compliance and making sure people get it before we start enforcing with Trojan Check and before flu season, that’s the most important [thing],” Van Orman said.
USC will likely enforce flu vaccines for Trojan Check by the end of the fall semester — around Dec. 15 — and students and faculty will be unable to return to campus for Spring 2022 without their vaccine. However, Student Health does not want students to miss finals as a result of flu shot compliance, Van Orman said.
According to Van Orman, the USC Care Crew will begin enforcing a vaccination mandate for guests entering campus on Nov. 8 and will require guests to show proof of vaccination or a negative coronavirus test within the last 72 hours — a policy consistent with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.  
To address reports of students completing Trojan Check with guest status, USC Care Crew will route all individuals that show up with guest statuses to a vaccine and testing verification system that requires proof of vaccination and photo ID. Students will not be allowed to use guest status after Nov. 8 as identification cards will be checked to verify the individuals are actually guests.
While coronavirus cases on campus increased two weeks ago as a result of the fall break, cases have not spiked further. Student Health reported 37 cases among students last week, compared to the 39 cases two weeks ago.
“We’re not seeing a spike, which we’re really happy about. But we are continuing to see them slightly elevated from where they were at the low point in the semester,” Van Orman said. 
Although USC Student Health does not have specific numbers, many in the USC community have received booster shots from the USC pharmacy, Van Orman said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone who received a Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine more than two months ago should receive a booster shot. For people who received Moderna or Pfizer more than six months ago and are over age 65, booster shots are recommended. 
USC has not decided coronavirus policy changes related to Trojan Check, coronavirus testing or mask mandates for the spring semester, Van Orman said. The policies will likely be driven by Los Angeles County guidelines closer to the start of the spring semester.
“We’re prepared to continue to do it, it really just depends on what we’re seeing with cases. Students have done an amazing job with complying with testing, and I think we’ve been able to keep our cases very low because of it,” Van Orman said.
USC plans to continue testing in preparation for Thanksgiving break and as students travel home to their families without coronavirus. USC Student Health also looks to send pre-Thanksgiving messages to encourage students to get tested immediately after they return to campus. 
“That’s when people travel that testing is very important. And we saw a really good testing post midterm break,” Van Orman said.
Student Health looks to also warning students to be observant of the prevalence of coronavirus while traveling , particularly when going out to restaurants or bars. 
“What we advise people is to really be aware of what the prevalence is where you’re going, because not all numbers are falling in a lot of the country right now,” Van Orman said. “So there are things you can do when you’re traveling, especially if you’re going into a higher prevalence part of the country.”

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault, drugging and violence. 
Since Wednesday, Oct. 27, the Undergraduate Student Government, Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence and USC administration planned to host an in-person town hall Tuesday where students and professors could voice concerns about the drugging and sexual assault reports at the Sigma Nu fraternity house and other locations on fraternity row. 
However, on the morning of Nov. 2 — the day of the town hall — USC administration canceled the event, and told USG they wanted to hold a Zoom Webinar instead with a question and answer chat feature.
“In a lot of ways, we felt like we were on the same page with [USC administration],” said USG president Alexis Areias. “But, as it got closer, and then today, it became very clear that University admin was not super comfortable with the vastness of this event, which was now open to the entire student body.”
At 3:22 p.m., less than two hours before the event, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles Zukoski and Acting Vice President for Student Affairs Monique Allard sent a communitywide email inviting students to a 5 p.m. Zoom Webinar with “USC senior leaders” to answer questions about the sexual assault reports. The webinar was unaffiliated with USG and the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence.
“We have chosen the webinar format to allow students an opportunity to discuss sensitive experiences without identifying themselves and to provide a chance to listen and participate if they choose in a safe setting,” the email read.
However, Areias said the webinar format took away from the impact of the planned event that would have allowed for more direct communication with administration, who are not usually accessible to students. 
“We were really, really hopeful that something like that could take place, and also to have that moment of community,” Areias said. “I think we can all agree. We know from Zoom and from being there and then back in class. There’s just a very stark difference there.”
In an Instagram post, USG wrote that the event’s cancellation was “disheartening.”
“We believe this discussion is instrumentally important and strive to emphasize the values of transparency and inclusiveness in addressing the issue of sexual violence,” the post read. 
Sydney Brown, president of the Trojan Democrats — an organization part of the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence — said she began collaborating on the town hall last week after Tuesday’s Panhellenic town hall in which sorority members expressed concerns and shared their Greek life experiences with administrators such as President Carol Folt.
Brown, who also serves as the chairwoman of the external affairs committee for USG, said she was “very unhappy” with the University’s response to the sexual assault reports and had looked forward to the town hall.
“It’s pretty enticing — the thought of being able to actually go face to face with administrative representatives to share your story in sort of a listening session format, and then also to hear the presentation that they had prepared,” Brown said. “I think that students were really looking forward to that.”
Around 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, Brown said Areias and USG vice president Lucy Warren called her into their conference room and said USC cancelled the town hall. 
“It was incredibly disheartening. I was angry,” Brown said. “It honestly did make me very emotional.” 
Brown said the joint town hall would have been one of the first times, in her experience, that the administration welcomed an event with student organizations, interested in hearing student perspectives and “supportive of students who are eager to speak their mind and share their thoughts and opinions on the issue of sexual violence at USC.”
However, the webinar format took that opportunity away, and “almost entirely defeated the purpose of the town hall to begin with,” Brown said.
During the town hall, administrators such as Folt, Zukoski, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman and Senior Vice President and General Counsel Beong-Soo Kim spoke about the University’s response to the sexual assault reports before answering questions that attendees wrote in a question and answer section.
Associate Vice Provost for Student Engagement Emily Sandoval and Assistant Vice Provost for Student Equity and Inclusion Naddia Palacios relayed questions ranging from why the administration has not abolished Greek life to what the consequences are for students who “have slandered and verbally abused the Panhellenic community.”
Following the town hall, Areias said the webinar format allowed students to learn information about resources on campus and covered many of the issues USG wanted addressed. However, she believes the previous format would have been beneficial.
“What’s so beneficial about that is that you really do give administration a temperature check on what the University is really feeling,” she said. “Not many students get the opportunity to interact with administration on a daily basis. And, so, to have the opportunity to share personal thoughts, I think would have been incredibly beneficial for both students and administration.”
USG issued a statement last Wednesday with a list of demands for the administration, including accountability for perpetrators, institutional reform, supportive resources for students and transparency about how long the administration knew about the reports. 
In a communitywide email Friday night, Folt admitted USC first learned about drugging and sexual assault reports at Sigma Nu on Sept. 30, nearly three weeks before students received an email from the Department of Public Safety. On Oct. 16, another student reported to DPS that they were sexually assaulted by a member of Sigma Nu.
Areias said USG has not had any additional communication with the administration since the event was canceled.
When asked for comment about USG’s frustration with the cancellation, USC referred the Daily Trojan to Zukoksi and Allard’s email.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault, drugging and violence. 
USC administration held a town hall webinar Tuesday evening to discuss drugging and sexual assault reports at the Sigma Nu Fraternity and other fraternities on the Row. Speakers included President Carol Folt, Provost Charles Zukoski, USC Senior Vice President and General Counsel Beong-Soo Kim, Department of Public Safety Chief John Thomas and seven other members of the administration. 
USC, in partnership with the Undergraduate Student Government and the Student Coalition Against Sexual Violence, initially scheduled to the host the townhall Tuesday night in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom. The University canceled the event and hosted their own webinar unaffiliated with USG and the student coalition. 
Senior Associate Vice Provost for Student Affairs Monique Allard, during the webinar, said USC canceled the joint forum because administrators heard from students that discussing sexual assault would be uncomfortable in a public format. 
Folt began the event by promising students change in the University’s process of reporting sexual assaults. 
“I’m confident that we’ve already put in place the safety net that would have caught that delayed warning. So it won’t happen again,” Folt said. “We owned it publicly and we will continue to do that. We won’t hide; we’re not going to run away from these hard problems. We really want to run towards them and fix them.”
USC delayed reporting information about “five to seven” druggings and sexual assaults initially reported to USC’s Relationship & Sexual Prevention Services, according to a Universitywide email Oct. 29. The cases, reported to the Department of Public Safety between Sept. 25 and 30, took nearly a month before the reports were disclosed to the public in an Oct. 20 email. 
According to the University’s Frequently Asked Questions included in the Oct. 29 email, RSVP reached out to other USC departments — including DPS, USC Student Health, Student Affairs and the Office of Campus Wellbeing and Crisis Intervention about the reports on Sept. 30 — but a meeting to discuss the information was not scheduled until Oct. 18. 
“In retrospect, [the meeting] should have been scheduled much sooner so that the information from RSVP could have been analyzed for the community,” Kim said. 
Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman provided resources to attendees during the webinar, including Sexual Assault Response Team centers, which are county designated to assist victims and have trained providers to conduct forensic exams.
“The goal of a forensic exam is not only to provide any needed care to that individual, but also to collect and preserve physical evidence that can be used in a criminal investigation,” Van Orman said.
Following a webinar question that asked Folt whether she would stop ongoing protests, Folt said stopping protests is not under USC jurisdiction because they occurred on private streets, but marches on campus are allowed and supported. 
Folt encouraged people to be active in events such as the webinar where discussion “could be better off” staying within the USC community instead of the surrounding area to keep the events “associated with the people that really want to hear it and be a part of it.”
“I would really hope that we could try to direct people away from being in neighborhoods where not only are there many students, many survivors, people trying to go about their business but also neighborhoods where there are children and families,” Folt said.
During the webinar’s question and answer section, Zukoski was asked if USC would consider the abolition of Greek life on campus. He rejected the idea and said sexual assault is a broader, problematic issue in society.
“Sexual violence is problematic across all of our society and across all of the USC community,” Zukoski said. “It is individuals who commit crimes, it isn’t the entire organization … Large numbers of students see the fraternities and sororities as places to build community.” 
Following the question and answer section of the webinar, Allard concluded the webinar by thanking the attendees and speakers and promised the administration’s support in continuing the conversation. 
“We will continue this dialogue because it’s important to us to be here to support you, to listen and to move through this journey together,” Allard said.

After a year of online performances held on Twitch, USC’s resident drag performers are making an in-person comeback at their 12th annual USC Drag Show Nov. 13 at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center Ballroom. “The Birth of Drag,” the theme for this year’s show, will feature looks and performances that represent the revival of the drag scene and student life after coronavirus lockdowns. 
“I think of it as the most fun event that happens at USC, and it’s the best kept secret of USC,” said Sasha Urban, director of the Drag Show. “Audience members can expect to be overwhelmed with talent and artistry and comedy and cunt.”
The drag show will be the Queer and Ally Student Assembly’s biggest event of the year, said Urban, a senior majoring in journalism. The show is expected to seat up to 800 audience members in a celebration of queer art. “The Birth of Drag” will be headlined by Monique Heart of “RuPaul’s Drag Race” in addition to a variety of student performers: Annie Vaxxer, April Mae June, Aura Sublime, Daisy Darling, Gal Fieri, Jamie Angel, Miss T Wood, Ra Oblivion, Romeo Black, Satin Ringz and Tyra Durdxn. 
“I truly cannot stress enough how diverse the performances are. From pure sex on legs to the funniest stuff you’re ever going to see in a USC production to some of the scariest stuff you might see, it really runs the gamut,” Urban said.
USC’s annual drag show has evolved over the past 12 years into a thriving production that has featured drag royalty, such as Kylie Sonique Love, Gia Gunn, Scarlet Envy and Landon Cider. 
Nicholas Guzman, a senior majoring in international relations and the artist behind Jamie Angel, joined the show after freshman orientation. 
“It’s a really unique opportunity to be able to witness and be a part of, I know other universities have drag shows, but I don’t know if any of them ever do [it] this big,”  Guzman said.
After refining Jamie’s persona and aesthetic with the two virtual drag shows streamed on Twitch earlier this year, Guzman said they are excited to bring that energy to the big stage in front of a real audience.
The performers represent an array of gender identities who use drag as a form of gender subversion and gender expression. With the audition fliers calling for all kings, queens and things in between, this year’s show will represent an array of gender identities. 
Liv Haddad, a senior majoring in creative writing and whose drag persona is Romeo Black, began exploring masculine, feminine and androgynous gender identities through drag. 
“[Drag] definitely began as a way for me to explore my gender identity and my gender expression because I started doing drag pretty much right after I realized I was a non-binary trans masc and I still wanted to present in feminine ways,” Haddad said.
The performers also represent different levels of experience, featuring both seasoned performers and rookies who will make their debut at the show. Caleb Flenoury, a sophomore majoring in electrical and computer engineering, will be debuting as Satin Ringz in the show. 
The drag show also allows students to embrace and express themselves in ways they have never been able to previously. Flenoury describes his own experience where his parents discouraged him from pursuing drag. QuASA’s drag show provided Flenoury a place to be himself. 
“This space is inviting,” Flenoury said. “It allowed me to express myself in a way I couldn’t in some places.”  
Urban said that audience members should expect an immersive experience, with high production value and a variety of performances. This year’s show is composed of the largest cast in recent years,  and audiences should expect to see a runway presentation followed by performances ranging from a Beyoncé medley to Gal Fieri crashing her car in a drive through. 
“What everyone’s doing here is kind of a little bit crazy, a little bit fun. I think even if you’re not familiar with drag at all, you can come and have a great time,” said Tyra Durdxn, a drag queen who will perform at the event.
After performing as Annie Vaxxer in the drag show since 2018, Urban wanted to maintain the legacy of USC’s drag scene and preserve that community.
“I was so determined to make sure that the show does not die. I do not want COVID to kill this show. That would be the saddest thing to ever happen,” Urban said. “This is a really special event and to be an audience member in it is going to be like you’re a part of history in the making.” Correction: A published version of this article contained an incorrect quote from Haddad. The quote has been updated to reflect the correct wordage. The article was updated to correct the name of performer Gal Fieri and her pronouns. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

K-pop boy group THE BOYZ returned Nov. 1 with their third single album, “MAVERICK.” The three-track album departs from the group’s usual playful image, and instead embraces darker, more impactful concepts with hip-hop and R&B influences. 
The 11-member group — composed of members Sangyeon, Jacob, Younghoon, Hyunjae, Juyeon, Kevin, New, Q, Juhaknyeon, Sunwoo and Eric — debuted in 2017 under Cre.ker Entertainment. They have since established themselves as one of the most popular fourth-generation K-pop groups in the world, with numerous music show wins and a victory on Mnet competition show, “Road to Kingdom,” which pitted emerging boy groups against one another for a chance to compete on a later competition show, “Kingdom: Legendary War,” which aired in June. The album, which sold more than 158,000 copies on its first day of release, comes after the release of their sixth mini album, “THRILL-ING,” in August. 
The title track “MAVERICK” can sum up the album’s entire concept. The song is catchy from the beginning, with an addictive rhythm and impactful bass that complements the members’ dynamic additions to the tune. The group’s blend of main rapper Sunwoo’s powerful rapping with Kevin’s melodic rapping, juxtaposed with smooth vocals throughout the song’s verses, balances the intense chorus, in which the members repeatedly chant, “Back in the game son” and “I’m a, I’m a maverick.” 
The group sings about being a so-called “maverick,” or an independent-minded person, and choosing to forge their own path: “When everybody’s trying to be the same / I exist as I am,” and “A familiar path? That’s so boring / Why am I always so perverse?” 
The song’s lyrics make sense for a group such as THE BOYZ, who have delved into concepts examining youth and individuality numerous times. Identity film “GENERATION Z” portrays each member in a different light based on the message they each wanted to convey to fans, ranging from self-image to emotional openness, and ends with Kevin voicing the piece over, saying “We want to be honest, in our voice.” “BE YOUR OWN KING” focuses on a running theme to “Make your own,” with members making their own characters, stereotypes and freedom. 
Fans eagerly anticipated the release of “MAVERICK” upon seeing the group’s concept photos, which depicted the members wearing neck collars, reminiscent of those worn by characters in “Battle Royale,” a 2000 Japanese horror film, and viewing the album’s highlight medley, which includes a voiceover similar to that of the instructor in “Squid Game,” a 2021 Korean thriller Netflix series. 
The “MAVERICK” music video draws parallels to both “Battle Royale” and “Squid Game,” with  the video’s opening scene consisting of the members unconscious in cars and later fighting with each other. The usage of survival imagery to illustrate themes of self-originality and identity is unorthodox in itself, and is one that THE BOYZ nails. 
The album makes a noticeable shift with “Hypnotized,” a “dreamlike” song with strong R&B influence. A necessary break from the strong beats of the title track, “Hypnotized” is slow, yet still packed with intensity, as the members sing about their infatuation with someone, with lyrics such as “I’m falling deeper and deeper inside” and “Baby, I can’t get away from you, hypnotized.” The group continues to juxtapose whispers against strong vocal ad libs in this track, paired with a consistent instrumental throughout. 
In contrast, “Russian Roulette” has a mystifying instrumental, utilizing a variety of samples that adds to the song’s interest and depth. The group reverts back to the album’s overt survival game concept, singing “I’ll bet my everything / A game standing on the edge of a cliff in the deadly darkness” and “The more dangerous the game / the more addicted it gets.” Main vocalists Sangyeon and New shine on this track, with their vocals in the bridge brightening the song before its final chorus.
While the album’s mere three tracks all contribute a different sound, they complement each other and the group’s latest concept seamlessly.

The fall season brings the most comforting, nostalgic flavors. From pumpkin spice to apple cinnamon to hot chocolate, it can be difficult to satisfy these cravings while in college without blowing all of your money on pumpkin spice lattes, and cooking may seem like a challenge in tiny apartments with limited ingredients. Luckily, there are plenty of simple, cheap recipes you can make for fun November flavors with just a microwave and a few staple pantry items. Here’s a list of flavorful and seasonal treats you can make in the comfort of your kitchen. 
Pumpkin Cranberry Oatmeal 
I’m willing to bet this is the best thing you will eat this fall. Who needs pumpkin pie when you can have a warm, delicious bowl of this oatmeal? 
Prep time: 2 minutes
Cook time: 1 minute
Servings: 1
Ingredients: 
Instructions: 
Stir together oats and water and microwave for approximately 1 minute, or until oats begin to look soft. Add the pumpkin, brown sugar and cinnamon. Microwave for 30-60 more seconds, adding more water if needed. Mix in cranberries to taste. 
Apple Crisp 
This recipe is simple but amazing. It tastes like eating dessert for breakfast, but you can tell your parents you’re eating healthy. 
Prep time: 5 minutes
Cook time: 2 minutes 
Servings: 1
Ingredients: 
Instructions: 
In a microwavable mug, combine apple chunks, ¼ teaspoon cinnamon and melted butter. In a separate dish, combine flour, oats, brown sugar and the remaining cinnamon. Work in the softened butter using a fork. Layer this mixture with the apple chunks in the mug and microwave for approximately 2 minutes.
Cinnamon Banana
This recipe is courtesy of my sister, and, I will admit, I thought she was crazy when she shared it with me. It sounds weird, but don’t judge until you’ve tried it! It is the perfect snack when you just need a little bit of holiday cheer and it will make your kitchen (or dorm) smell amazing.
Prep time: 1 minute
Cook time: 30 seconds 
Servings: 1

Mash the banana into a microwave safe bowl. Stir in the cinnamon and vanilla extract. Microwave for 20-30 seconds and prepare to be amazed! 
Hot Chocolate Popcorn
If you’re not a fan of spices, this is the recipe for you. Hot chocolate is a holiday staple, but Los Angeles weather doesn’t always invoke a hot-cocoa-sipping mood. For those days when you need a chocolate fix, try this surprisingly simple, addictive treat. 
Prep time: 10 minutes 
Servings: 4
Ingredients: 
Instructions: 
Melt the chocolate chips by microwaving in 30 second intervals and stirring in between until smooth. In a large bowl, slowly pour the chocolate over the popped popcorn, then stir until the popcorn is completely coated in chocolate. Lay the popcorn out on a baking sheet and pour the crushed peppermint over the top. Allow it to set for about 30 minutes (or put the pan in the freezer to speed up this process). Once the chocolate on the popcorn hardens mix in mini marshmallows, if desired.

When you’re missing home-cooked meals, you have to try this. It only takes a few minutes to prepare, it’s super cheap and it tastes just like Thanksgiving at home. 
Prep Time: 1 minute
Cook time: 8 minutes
Servings: 2
Ingredients: 
Instructions: 
Wash the sweet potato and poke about 25 holes all around it using a fork. Microwave for 8 to 10 minutes until mushy. Be careful removing itfrom the microwave — it’ll be hot! Let cool for 2-3 minutes.

Picture this: You’re at summer camp, and, from half a mile away, out of nowhere, you hear “California Gurls” by Katy Perry. The source? A spontaneous ensemble of elementary school-aged children, led by a five-year-old Alex Oliva. 
For Oliva, a senior majoring in performance (popular music), that song meant more than an earworm. Oliva believes that every song contains value, whether it’s a quick and catchy pop song playing on the radio or a soulful ballad.  
“Sometimes, the actual content within [a song] isn’t meaningful, but, as a whole, songs can be meaningful,” Oliva said. “But, just because it was such a fun song, now, whenever I hear it, I just get so happy, and I want my music to mean that for people, and to remind them of a specific place or time.”
Oliva entered the music realm with piano lessons at four years old. In eighth grade, his curiosity was piqued by YouTube pop music singing tutorials, where he said he “re-fell” in love with music. Investing time into his favorite music genre expanded his horizons as an artist. 
His musical influences stem from his parents’ vast range of favorites such as Stevie Wonder, Earth, Wind & Fire, Chicago, Whitney Houston and Bon Jovi. Oliva’s passions transition from classic rock and Motown to R&B elements from rappers such as J. Cole and Kendrick Lamar. 
Working with others has given Oliva the opportunity to improve and gain more experience in forming a personal style — or “groove” — as well as leadership skills he’s developed from directing a band, he said. 
“I’m constantly learning from my peers. I learned just as much from my peers [as] I [have] learned from my teachers, I’d say,” Oliva said. “I just feel really blessed to be able to learn from them constantly and be a student [of] their wisdom.” 
Signed to 840 West, USC’s student-run record label, Oliva’s first single, titled “Baby Girl” released in September 2020 and his most recent single, “u & i,” featuring Jillian Batt, dropped March 2021. Each song received more than 6,000 streams on Spotify.
“Both of those [songs] were kind of like me dreaming of other times. Just normalcy when I didn’t have normalcy, I guess you could say,” Oliva said. “I love spending time with my family, but I was definitely missing a connection with friends. Even though those songs are romantic, there is still influence that I draw from how much I love my friends. So it was kind of approaching those [songs] certainly with a sense of desire, and wishing to be back to a place where I wasn’t.”
“Baby Girl” was Oliva’s attempt to lighten up the gloom of 2020. Performance and relatable music makes Oliva an unforgettable artist and personality to his colleagues and vocal instructor.   
“What really stood out for me with Alex is, he’s all about performing. Like, he’s really into performing and making sure that he’s very audience-driven,” said Kristin Logemann, a sophomore majoring in music industry. “He wants to make sure that everyone is having a good time and is relating to his music.” 
Jeffrey Allen, an assistant professor of practice at the Thornton School of Music, can attest to the charisma Oliva embodies as a hardworking student and singer who truly takes in opportunities and lessons whole-heartedly to consistently improve and define his voice. 
“Alex has a kind of joie de vivre. I think he’s got a very intoxicating energy,” Allen said. “In the performance world, we have people who have a lot of ability, we have people that have a lot of technical training, but there’s always that X factor. And I think Alex just has some of that X factor.” 
Oliva’s next single will be more vulnerable compared to the previous two and geared toward alternative R&B. He also plans for his next few releases to carry similar themes that contain a story but also string together a larger narrative. 
“The genre is a little bit more aligned with what I want to do. And a lot of them are kind of about looking back at my struggles,” Oliva said. “A lot of those songs kind of look back to those moments, and some of it is when I got out of it, and some of it is when I was in the thick of it.” 
Growing up in a predominantly white town in Philadelphia, Oliva said he didn’t see many Pilipino artists or musicians he could look up to as role models, but he’s found a way to consider this a benefit.
“I think [not having many Pilipino musician role models] was almost a blessing because I didn’t feel like I needed to listen to one type of music. So I got all these amazing influences from all different types of cultures and perspectives,” he said.
Developing his own artistry in the music scene with his individual style and beliefs, Oliva said he hopes to become a voice for Pilipino children with dreams similar to his own. 
“Music and dancing and art in the Pilipino culture is so prevalent and so vibrant. And people are constantly singing; that’s one of the first places where I really played and sang pop songs for people,” Oliva said. “[I] started playing and singing for people and I saw what that can do, and how it can bring people together. So I really do want to make sure that there’s Pilipino children out there who can look and see like, ‘Hey, that’s a Pilipino person that’s killing it and has their own artistic vision for their life.’”

USC women’s soccer will round out its 2021-22 Pac-12 season in a de facto conference title match against cross-town rivals No. 3 UCLA. The derby match comes after the Trojans defeated former title contenders Stanford in an overtime thriller after conceding 2 goals in the first half. 
USC remains atop the Pac-12 standings with 26 points after 10 conference matches. UCLA,unbeaten in all season matches, are second in the conference with 24 points. With a win or draw, the Trojans would clinch its first outright Pac-12 title in program history. 
The Bruins come off a narrow win against Berkeley as junior forward Mia Fishel scored a golden goal in double overtime to keep UCLA in conference title contention. Fishel is currently UCLA’s highest goalscorer and has provided 5 goals and 4 assists in conference play this season. 
USC faced the Bruins twice last season, both 2-2 affairs. The Trojans ended UCLA’s eight-game winning run during their first bout in a friendly match in the middle of the Pac-12 season. 
Head Coach Keidane McAlpine looks to see improvements from last season’s matches against UCLA. 
“It’s not just any game — it’s a championship game,” said Coach McAlpine in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We’ve had two brief matches with [UCLA] in the spring that both ended in draws … We feel like we’re better than we were in the two matches that we played last year so we feel good about our ability to go out and play well.” 
Despite beating Stanford 3-2 last Sunday to remain first in the Pac-12, USC conceded two first half goals at home. 
Junior midfielder Croix Bethune’s goal and freshman forward Simone Jackson’s contributions helped the Trojans come back from the 2-0 deficit and cemented an invincible home record for the 2021-2022 Pac-12 season. 
“We had a lack of defensive understanding, so we didn’t do well enough in the way we wanted to do it,” McAlpine said. “From a mentality standpoint, I thought that, once we got a little down in the game in the first half we didn’t quite hold onto our confidence … I’d like to see us rebound a little faster.” 
Senior forward Penelope Hocking, all-time program goalscorer, remains questionable for the derby match after experiencing an injury against Washington State two weeks ago. 
Junior forwards Hannah White and Jackson emerged from the bench in past matches and pitched in important performances. Redshirt senior midfielder Savannah DeMelo also adopted a more defensive role in McAlpine’s side. 
“The confidence that [White, Jackson and DeMelo] have in their roles changing have been important and paramount to our success,” McAlpine said. “I also feel like [freshman midfielder] Helena Sampaio came into the game and gave us great minutes, and, even though there were only a few moments, [freshman forward] Julia Gomez and [sophomore forward] Katie Roditis gave us great minutes.” 
USC and UCLA will compete in their last match of the Pac-12 season in what will determine the conference winner. Both teams remain unbeaten in conference play and look to become the best team in not only the Pac-12 but in Los Angeles. 
“In this match, the intensity is high, the crowd is fantastic — we’ll be playing against another sold-out crowd,” McAlpine said. “That energy also hypes up the game and the players have a better energy about them … It’s one of those games that will hold up a lot of meaning, just as the schools being rivals, but will also hold a lot of meaning when it comes to preparation for the tournament.”
The Trojans will face the Bruins Friday in the Bruins’ Wallis Annenberg Stadium. Kick off begins at 8 p.m.

The NBA possesses a completely different outlook this season. Referees are striking down on foul-baiting; offenses are struggling to score at the high caliber we have seen over the past few years and team defenses are thriving. Let’s take a look at how some former Trojans have fared so far in the NBA’s 75th anniversary season. 
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls: 
DeMar DeRozan’s veteran presenze has made the Chicago Bulls a definitive playoff team. Holding the best record in the Eastern Conference, the Bulls look to be relevant in the NBA picture after missing out on the playoffs for the past four years. 
Adding point guard Lonzo Ball and DeRozan — two legitimate offensive threats and excellent passers — has allowed guard Zach LaVine to move off the ball within the offense, cut to the rim, come off screens and pindowns and create scoring opportunities for others. 
DeRozan’s lack of three-point shooting hasn’t been an issue. He’s putting up his highest scoring totals since his best year with the Raptors when they won 51 games in the 2015-16 season. 
DeRozan recently put up 37 points on 15 for 20 shooting against the Boston Celtics in a comeback victory Monday night. 
He could find himself making another All-Star appearance if he can continue to change the trajectory of the Bulls franchise and propel them to the playoffs. 
Forward Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers:
As revered as Trojan Athletics programs are, they have yet to house an all-time great NBA player. DeRozan, a four-time All-Star, is the most successful player to come out of USC. But eight games into his NBA career, Mobley looks absolutely generational. 
The 7-footer has drawn comparisons to Kevin Garnett and Anthony Davis, hefty expectations for a 20 year old. His defensive prowess drives these comparisons — his ability to swat shots with both hands, vertically contest without fouling and defend premier perimeter players with his agility. 
His presence on that end alone already transformed the Cleveland Cavaliers into a formidable defense and a tough opponent on a nightly basis, something that couldn’t be said for the franchise since LeBron James’ departure. They have already notched impressive wins against the Denver Nuggets, Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets and Los Angeles Clippers. 
Offensively, he’s got the skill, averaging 13.6 points, 7.9 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game. Mobley had a huge homecoming game against the Lakers when hescored 23 points and 6 rebounds. He has the touch to finish deep position floaters and hooks, as well as the shooting ability from both the mid-range and three-point line. 
Perhaps his most underrated skill is his passing and overall offensive awareness; the Cavaliers love to run sets where Mobley holds the ball in his hands and initiates from the top of the key. He has not only transformed the Cavaliers’ defense but also gives them a boost on offense, which makes him hard to keep off the floor — he leads the team in minutes per game as a rookie.
Mobley’s slow release and slender frame are his two biggest deficiencies at the moment — two issues that can be corrected within a few years. It’s rare to see a player look NBA-ready early in his career. Trojan basketball may have produced a generational talent. 
Guard Kevin Porter Jr, Houston Rockets:
The Houston Rockets drafting shooting guard Jalen Green — the second pick in the 2021 NBA Draft — has forced Kevin Porter Jr. to adapt to a new role. Porter Jr. has the skills and raw talent to be an excellent offensive talent, so Head Coach Stephen Silas had to give the former Trojan astarting job. 
But neither Green nor Porter Jr. have the strength to guard the small forward position, so the Rockets have experimented with having both in the backcourt, with Porter Jr. playing the point guard. He has shown flashes of being a playmaker, but the jury is still out on whether he can fully command a team’s offense and keep the ball moving.
Six games into the season, Porter Jr. and the Rockets struggled, winning just one of their six games this season. He leads the league in turnovers with 5.3 per game while his field goal efficiency dipped to 40.9% on 11 shots per game. The point guard experiment looks to have failed early in the season.
But Porter Jr. is only 21 years old on a team without much talent around him, and you can see the flashes of an offensive mastermind on a nightly basis, but young players often tend to be inconsistent as they adjust to the NBA. 
On this Rockets team without playoff aspirations, the former Trojan can get real time reps every game without the pressure of winning. He’s a work in progress, and the Rockets knew that when they signed him as a free agent.

With the arrival of the college football playoff rankings Monday, we got a first look at the schools vying for the top four to compete for the nationalchampionship. 
Although these games are enjoyable to watch because they include the best of the best, the schools usually end up with the same lineup almost every year with some iteration of Alabama, Clemson (although not this year for sure), Oklahoma, Ohio State and some other major powerhouse, such as Georgia. 
I’m not going to lie; it does get somewhat boring just seeing the same teams play over and over again. That’s why college basketball is much more enjoyable among fans of both sports because there are 64 teams, increasing the possibility of more upsets between the small and major programs, thus, the name March Madness. 
Unfortunately, you can’t really call the CFP madness. 
I think the most evident case of the restrictive atmosphere of the football playoffs is the example of the 2017 UCF Knights, who went undefeated and still didn’t get an invite. There were arguments that their schedule was too easy compared to other schools, but why not give them a shot to see how they would fare against the top schools? 
Still, UCF was able to edge out Auburn in the Peach Bowl, showing it was able to compete with top college football schools in the nation. Hopefully, the same won’t happen to Cincinnati if they stay undefeated this season. 
Nevertheless, all these complaints I just mentioned might go away soon. Currently, the CFP committee is reassessing the competition’s format with the introduction of more teams. After announcing the expansion this summer, the committee considered looking into what would be a more equitable way to involve more teams. Right now, the current debate is between an 8-team or 12-team format. 
There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Obviously, the major reason for the 12-team format is that more teams can participate, especially those that are not from the Power 5 conferences. With more teams, this also equals more television revenue with estimates at around a combined $450 million of additional revenue if the 12-team format takes place in 2024 and 2025. 
Additionally, with more involved programs, that means their fans will more likely attend these playoff bowl games and purchase merchandise, which can bring more money to schools. Still, by having 12-teams, more games can also lead to other issues such as injuries and other troubles with a longer season. 
Moreover, as the playoffs expand with more bowl games, the bowls that are not included are going to lose even more value now. Although, this is not really a one-to-one comparison  (think about March Madness compared to other post-season college basketball tournaments, such as NIT and CBI — I highly doubt too many people are watching the latter two). So, the same issue could occur again with these other non-playoff bowl games in the future. 
A potential solution could be to get rid of bowl games in the playoffs so that every game is equal, similar to how it is in March Madness. But that is very unlikely to happen. The major bowl games have too much history since their start with the 1902 Rose Bowl. 
If major teams are playing in just the “semifinals” or “quarterfinals,” the playoffs will lose some of the game’s sentiment for them. Additionally, losing the sponsors for these bowl games will not help financially either. Schools and conferences can get payouts in the millions if their team wins one. 
Even though there is more risk with a longer season, I believe the 12-game approach would be the best way to structure the playoffs so that teams have a chance at the championship. Rather than playing the what-if game to see if an undefeated non-Power 5 school could have beaten Alabama in the playoffs, let’s try to actually see that happen moving forward. 
It would be great financially, and more importantly, it would make watching the playoffs more enjoyable as well.

While my straightforward personality can be broken down into three simple categories — my love for gerontology, my grief for my exes, my obsession with TWICE  — I rarely talk about my interest in occupational therapy. Through classes for my occupational science minor, professors instill time and time again that I need to develop my own definition for occupations, so here’s my take: Occupations are activities that, whether we enjoy them or not, are critical to our daily function and social engagement.
In fact, I am learning more about my favorite occupation through a class on animal companions and communication — specifically, animal assisted therapy. Personally, I have a maltipoo named “Tobias ‘Toby’ Angelo” — a generic, small, crusty-eyed white dog owned by a middle-class Asian family. Toby certainly does not qualify as a therapy dog like some of his peers, but he still helps me get through my day as one of the few things I look forward to on my drive back home. 
Toby is also pretty young — turning three on this column’s day of publication — despite officially relegating me back to the youngest in the family in human years. While I potty trained him and gave him the whole rundown of sitting and lying down to curate a facade of independence, I still give him showers, take him on walks and put him to bed every night. I also just talk with Toby, ask him how his day went, nap with him at home and rant about my road rage incidents on the way back from USC. 
Yet, when I think of my pet owner responsibilities, my head’s broken gerontology record drives me to piece together the life of an older pet owner. 
“But Lois,” you, the inquisitive reader, say. “Certainly, the benefits of having an animal companion, dog or not, would outweigh the inconveniences that may come with the caretaking and cleaning responsibilities of owning a pet.” 
Simply put, it depends on a smorgasbord of variables — the animal’s housing, caretaker, breed and attitude, previous experiences with other pets or animal companions, etc. However, studies show that older adults will experience some form of physical health benefit in the presence of  dogs, as they provide companionship for a population often plagued with social isolation and depressive attitudes. 
But, let’s think of older adults who may not have the physical capacity or emotional wellbeing to care for a canine companion. Organizations such as Paws4Elders aim to provide older adults with human-animal bonds beyond usual fostering or adoption methods. 
In a new sector named “robotherapy,” Paws4Elders has a new space dedicated to situations “when interactions with live pets are not possible” and where an “artificial animal can still yield health benefits and ease stress.” Pet partners include Tombot and Joy for All’s series of companion pets. 
The innovation provides an interesting look into the future, especially with the rise of artificial companion animals. This discussion is nothing new either, with articles from as early as five years ago evaluating the pros and cons of these programmed pooches. It erases the hassle of clean-up duty, grooming and veterinary care while also ridding owners of the physical benefits that come with walking and the sense of spontaneity that accompanies real canine partners. 
The technology has its merits and tradeoffs; however, studies show the long-term benefits vary when comparing real to robotic companions. In short, interventions utilizing technology as a framework for health and well being, while sustainable and less intensive, must invoke the same feelings and experiences as their real life counterparts. 
Ultimately, the field of animal assisted therapies and interventions continues to develop with different groups reaping various benefits from their animal companions. While regulations and guidelines on service and therapy dogs’ education have yet to be nationally standardized, it’s without question that the benefits help promote a better quality of life. 
For older adults, the pros, cons and alternatives to pets or animal-based interventions should be discussed upfront and center as part of the decision making process. A one size fits all approach negatively impacts all older adults, both those able to adequately care for their pet and those who may need a bit of assistance. 
So, when I’m rocking back and forth on my front porch and call out to a Terminator version of Toby that looks like the Boston Dynamics robot dog, I’ll sit back and think, “Back in my day…”

Infographics have taken over our Instagram story feeds. Some make use of pastel colors with pink backgrounds and light-green texts. Others employ images and decorative stickers, perhaps a star or two in the corner. 
While aesthetically pleasing, these infographics address heavy topics, ranging from the Israel-Palestine conflict to the Taliban in Afghanistan to climate change.
It is hard to resist reposting these, especially with the social capital that accompanies “wokeness” and social awareness. While many mindlessly add these Instagram infographics to their stories to spread awareness of an issue, these actions could also have real and harmful consequences.
Firstly, these infographics contain the potential for misinformation. Whether the person posting the slide has good intentions or not, humans err and Instagram does not monitor its accounts in the same way mainstream news media publications fact-check their work. Yes, users can “flag” certain posts, but in such a dense media ecosystem, the responsibility falls on the user to determine the right facts themselves, which will inevitably promote misinformation. 
Infographics have also risen in popularity because they are easy for scrolling users to digest. As communicated by a University of Rochester study, “More than 50 percent of the cortex, the surface of the brain, is devoted to processing visual information.” 
By taking the path of least resistance, users are more likely to engage with an infographic than a dense article with cited facts and information. However, they may miss crucial context because the infographic simply does not have room to fully explore the issue in 10 compact slides.
As stated by @BeeBabs or Bolu Babalola, a British author who has been featured on the 2021 Forbes 30 under 30 Europe, on Twitter, “[Infographics] should be launchpads for your own reading/fact-checking.” While many people hold this sentiment, Instagram accounts such as @so.informed, @feminist or @chnge still oversimplify complex issues to promote their accounts and elevate their own political agenda.
@chnge even monetizes activism by selling merchandise while sprinkling advocacy posts in its feed. In the same way that one should not consume partisan media because it lowers trust and increases polarization according to Pew Research, one should not only look at infographics from sources with a clear political leaning.
For example, @so.informed has almost three million Instagram followers. As its name suggests and biography states, this account seeks to inform people so they are more willing to take valuable action. 
However, this account is unapologetically partisan. On multiple occasions, it explicitly endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders, both by reposting his tweets and by wishing him a happy birthday. The account even endorsed Nina Turner with the caption, “Nina Turner is running for the 11th House District in Cleveland. Let’s talk and then let’s do all we can to get Nina elected!”
The account raises awareness of many important social issues, from LGBTQ+ rights to mental health issues to gun violence. However, because it openly skews to one side of the political spectrum and condenses complex information, users should independently fact-check posts before reposting and potentially spreading misinformation. 
The infographic epidemic has also led to a phenomenon known as “slacktivism.” The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS formally defines this term as an action taken on by “people who support a cause by performing simple measures [but] are not truly engaged or devoted to making a change.” 
When someone reposts an infographic, they may feel like an activist by simply clicking “post,” but activism is much more than that. As stated by Cherwell, the student magazine at the University of Oxford, “A side effect of slacktivism is that it has also somewhat glamourised what protesting at the grassroots level looks like. In reality, organizing is a tedious and emotionally exhausting process that requires fighting for basic human rights in a political system that is reluctant to change.” 
While there is undeniable value to using social media’s landscape to break down issues for users, we must address the problems that arise with infographics to avoid perpetuating them. It is true that community-centered accounts use infographics to relay valuable information, so how do we ensure that these accounts are not affected negatively by the sea of disinformation perpetuated by other infographics? The solution is research. Every infographic publisher has a responsibility to relay accurate information, and as users, we should openly question where infographics have gotten their facts from, as well as their intentions in the same way we should with media publications. 
We must be mindful of the media we consume and repost, all while taking accountability for the errors we make. Slacktivism and lazy reposting will not create change, but actively participating in our communities and in social justice campaigns will.
