In USC’s most recent practice Tuesday, senior running back Curtis McNeal broke off a long run down the sidelines. He broke a couple of tackles along the way and sped down the field, giving the Trojans a reminder of how he ended last season. McNeal ran for more than 1,000 yards, and given the fact that he only started a handful of games, completed an impressive feat.
Changes · Senior runningback Curtis McNeal rushed for more than 1,000 yards in 2011. His yardage went largely unnoticed, however, on the national stage because of USC’s emphasis on the passing game. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
McNeal and the Trojans have long been known as “Tailback U” because of the legendary backs that have graced the campus: Mike Garrett, OJ Simpson, Charles White, Marcus Allen, Ricky Bell, Anthony Davis and Sam Cunningham. Each one of these players made his own impact on the USC record books. Three of them won the Heisman Trophy, and each went on to play in the NFL. Simpson and Allen are in the NFL Hall of Fame.
Yes, USC has had its share of great backs, but recently the “Tailback U” label has been largely irrelevant.
From 2006-2008, the Trojans did not have a single rusher gain 1,000 yards. Joe McKnight broke the streak in 2009, but in 2010 the Trojans again failed to have a 1,000-yard rusher.
Though the 2005 Trojans featured two 1,000-yard rushers in Reggie Bush and LenDale White, they might not have even been the focal point of the offense: Quarterback Matt Leinart was under center, running the offense with precision and throwing to receivers such as Dwayne Jarrett and Steve Smith.
When McKnight gained 1,000 yards, it was hardly an awe-inspiring 1,000 yards. Instead, all the attention was on the freshman quarterback out of Mater Dei High School named Matt Barkley. McKnight was not even named first or second team all conference for his efforts. His work went largely unnoticed.
The same can be said of McNeal last year. He had a lot of yards but was sort of lost in the mix behind Barkley’s 3,500 yards and 39 touchdown passes, in addition to his pair of 1,000-yard receivers, Robert Woods and Marqise Lee.
McNeal had some huge games, such as his monster efforts against Stanford and Washington. But those games are not remembered for the running efforts the Trojans put forth; they are remembered for the passes Barkley threw.
USC is as strong as ever right now, as they look to be a preseason top-five team come September. But “Tailback U” does not hold the same weight it used to, and it hasn’t for a few years now.
The passing game has taken over football, but some programs still emphasize the running game as their focal point. This year’s national champion, Alabama, featured Trent Richardson, who finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. Oregon has been led by a fierce running game the past few seasons, headlined by LaMichael James, Kenjon Barner and De’Anthony Thomas. Wisconsin, which went to the Rose Bowl last season, had Russell Wilson at quarterback, but Montee Ball was the Heisman Trophy finalist. USC, however, no longer fits in with these programs, and certainly hasn’t for years.
Though they have a 1,000- yard rusher, the team is not built around the ground game. When McKnight ran for 1,000, he was not the focal point. Bush and White were a huge part of the 2005 offense, but they were not necessarily the most important parts of the offense.
There is no problem with USC not being a running-based offense like it used to be; the landscape of college football has changed significantly since Mike Garrett won his Heisman in the 1960s. USC is not really “Tailback U” anymore. It certainly was in its heyday, but “Tailback U” serves as a memory in this era of USC football. It is a remnant of the past, something for generations to cherish.
There have been 1,000-yard rushers recently. But it is the passers — Carson Palmer, Matt Leinart, John David Booty, Mark Sanchez and Barkley — that have ruled the field at the Coliseum over the past decade.
No, USC is not “Tailback U” anymore. Great tailbacks like McNeal are still here putting up numbers, but they are not the featured aspects the team.
And as long as USC keeps winning, there is nothing wrong with that.

Hey another great paper, I love to keep up to date with your articles. I do however want to point out a serious mistake you have made. You did not place Reggie Bush in the array of amazing backs that represent Tailback U. Sure he lost the Heisman, but he still WON it and a National Championship!! He still destroyed teams by leaping and running like no one had since OJ Simpson. For you to downplay his achievements just because he is not allowed to be in Heritage Hall, it is truly upsetting. I really respect you as a writer, but you and I both know Leinart AND Bush were the dynamic duo who got amazing praise. Both played on the same field while having Heisman trophies under their belt, who else has done that? Sure McNeal and McNight do not have the awe factor because of Barkley’s throwing prowess, but Reggie Bush certainly hailed at USC, and in the NFL, becoming the first pick in that draft!

It was only months ago that the Golden Bears’ baseball team was making national headlines for its unlikely College World Series run in the wake of the program’s brush with extinction.
Now, California arrives at Dedeaux Field to take on USC, eager to turn around a rough start to 2012 that has left the Golden Bears at the bottom of the Pac-12 standings at the midway point of the season.
The Trojans, however, should be prepared to face the team that made a run at Omaha, Neb., last season, not the one treading water in one of the nation’s toughest conferences. Cal is just 1-5 against the two Pac-12 teams it has faced thus far, but is coming off a road series win over No. 25 Texas and could be primed for the type of run that it went on in 2011.
That’s mostly because of Cal’s lineup, which features six regulars hitting .300 or better and is led by infielder Tony Renda’s .351 mark.
USC’s likely senior starters, Andrew Triggs and Ben Mount, along with freshman Stephen Tarpley, won’t keep players like Renda and junior Darrel Matthews completely off the base paths, but neutralizing the hitters in front of and behind them would bode well for the Trojans.
Not to say USC’s offense won’t have just as big an impact on the series. Of all the players who have started at least 20 games for the Trojans, four are hitting .333 or better.
That appears to match up well on paper with Cal’s starting staff, which, aside from senior Matt Flemer, has struggled.
The Golden Bears’ other two probable pitchers for the weekend, Michael Theofanopoulos and Justin Jones, both have earned run averages above 4.30, with Jones’ sitting at 5.45.
That last statistic is particularly concerning for the Golden Bears, who just last year saw Jones receive All Pac-10 Honorable Mention honors to go along with a 9-6 record and a tidy 2.93 ERA.
With two starters possessing ERA in the lower threes, USC would appear to have an advantage on the mound heading into the weekend.
It doesn’t hurt that Tarpley, likely to start Saturday’s series finale, still has yet to lose a game as a Trojan.
The games were moved up to avoid playing the series finale on Easter Sunday. Thursday and Friday’s games begin at 6 p.m., with a 1 p.m. first pitch for Saturday’s series finale.
Cal has played only six conference games which is a far cry from the midway point of the season in that respect.
You do not mention their overall record or the two teams they played so far in the Pac-12 season.

The No. 1 USC mens’ volleyball team is primed to take a big step in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation race for the top seed with a set of weekend matches against No. 11 UC San Diego and No. 2 UC Irvine on Thursday and Saturday, respectively.
The Trojans (18-4, 14-4) have been riding a hot streak to the tune of 13 consecutive matches, including two wins against No. 3 UCLA and No. 5 Stanford.
After beating Stanford last weekend, USC coach Bill Ferguson cited a key lesson that will help the Trojans fight through the remaining four regular-season matches before the conference tournament.

“Stanford has lots of control and doesn’t give up easy points,” Ferguson said. “For us to be able to win is a good test for us going into the conference championship.”
Throughout the stretch, the Trojans have featured a lineup that has rotated three pin-hitters in two-spots with much success.
“We figured in the beginning that we would have different lineups,” Ferguson said. “Our edge is that we can morph for different situations, using any pair of [junior opposite hitter] Maddison [McKibbin], [sophomore opposite hitter] Tanner [Jansen] or [junior outside hitter Steven] Mochalski in those two spots.”
Despite a shuffling lineup, the Trojans have showed a level of composure far beyond their years. When asked about the prevailing theme of the current stretch, Ferguson and senior co-captain and outside hitter Tony Ciarelli echoed each other.
“We’ve been playing loose, not thinking too much,” Ciarelli said. “We haven’t let a team ranked below us beat us yet. It’s just a matter of maturity.”
The 2012 Trojans feature a less traditional maturity level than in years past. The 2011 team graduated four senior starters, including two All-American captains.
This year’s team works with a more nuanced dynamic of personalities including youth, veteran leadership and a simplified outlook on the season.
“There’s a clean slate with this group. This is a looser group [than 2011],” Ferguson said. “They understand taking things for what they are and always have their eyes on the next goal.”
The weekend will feature a pair of matches that has become familiar to the Trojans: a lesser-ranked team clawing for a shot at the postseason followed by a juggernaut.
UC San Diego (8-16, 6-13) is attempting to make a late push for the postseason. Though the team’s record isn’t daunting at a glance, the Tritons have been one of the hottest teams in the NCAA, notching a victory against No. 3 UCLA and two wins against No. 15 UC Santa Barbara over the last five matches.
“[UCSD is] a desperate team without an agenda, and that’s a very dangerous type of team to play,” Ferguson said. “They’ll bring their A-game.”
Saturday’s match against UC Irvine (19-4, 15-4) has the makings of a real test of the Trojans’ mettle. The Anteaters feature a nation-leading serving attack that fires 1.78 aces per set.
“We need to improve our high-ball hitting for Irvine,” Ferguson said. “They have great servers and will get us out of system at times so we need to be able to survive them.”
All told, the Trojans’ success hinges on their ability to continue to put inferior and competitive teams away.
“We need to continue the level of assertiveness,” Ferguson said. “We’ve been good at putting teams away.”
Both games will be played at 7 p.m. at the Galen Center.

USC’s receiving core is looking a little different than it did last season.
In fact, at times, it’s unrecognizable.
Other than sophomore receiver Marqise Lee, who was a star last season and has carried that success over to the spring, there have been some lesser known players who have stepped into the enormous shoes that junior receiver Robert Woods left when he announced he was out for the duration of spring practice.

One of the players making a name for himself is junior De’Von Flournoy.
Last season, Flournoy caught a total of zero passes. He has no catches in his Trojan tenure. But looking at him this spring, you sure wouldn’t think he was inexperienced.
Flournoy has made the routine catches but has made the difficult ones as well. And he is enjoying every second of it.
“It’s been wonderful,” Flournoy said. “I’ve been put in a position I’ve never been at before.”
Flournoy came to USC as a four-star recruit out of Birmingham High School. He had offers from some of the college football heavyweights, including Notre Dame and Oregon. Injuries, however, have hampered his career.
He has gotten lost in the receiving mix with Woods, Lee and former top recruit receiver George Farmer, all from Serra High School in Gardena, Calif., headlining the squad.
But injuries caught up with Farmer and Woods this spring, and Flournoy has been working with the first-string offense in their place.
Flournoy has had to change his outlook now that he is a focal point of the offense.
“It’s definitely a mindset,” Flournoy said. “I have to prepare myself the day before for all kinds of positions. I have to be ready for anything.”
He also said that in working with the first team, he has paid greater attention to detail and is taking things more seriously.
“I’m getting [more of a] feel for football,” Flournoy said. “[I’m] getting more comfortable being out on the field and just bettering myself as a football player.”
With more exposure and more chances to succeed, Flournoy has also gained a great deal of confidence.
But it is not just playing with the first team that is giving the junior confidence; it is his knack for the spectacular play and knowing that coaches are watching.
“I’m getting confidence by being out here, but I’m getting confidence by making big plays because I know it’s on film,” he said. “Like [associate head] coach [John] Baxter always says, ‘Every day, the coaches are going upstairs and watching a silent movie about you.’”
While his playing time has changed, so has his regular quarterback. Though he and freshman quarterback Max Wittek have the most catches between them this spring, Flournoy has had to adjust to catching passes from senior quarterback Matt Barkley.
“Every quarterback throws the ball differently,” Flournoy said. “Getting reps with Barkley out here [in practice] and outside of school is a good thing, because we’re working on timing … and that’s where you want to be. You want to be with the first team.”
When it comes down to it, however, Flournoy said that though his quarterback is different now, his job will always be the same: to catch the football when it comes his way, no matter who throws it.
“It’s just being out there and in a different position and just being able to catch the ball from the quarterback … if he trusts you enough to throw you the ball,” Flournoy said.
The offense has been somewhat of a work in progress this spring, with players normally atop the depth chart out with injuries. Flournoy, however, has not made any excuses; he is playing with the first team.
“We’ve installed a lot of plays so, as an offense, we have a lot that we’re handling mentally,” Flournoy said. “We just have to go out there and just execute it.”
Flournoy will likely take a back seat when Woods and Farmer return; however, he said he is making the most of his opportunities and is soaking in everything he has learned this spring, at every position he can.
“I’m not going in with the mindset I’m playing one position,” Flournoy said. “I’m in the mindset of being thrown everything.”

Construction on Phase III of the School of Cinematic Arts reached a milestone with the placement of the highest beam on a new 40,000-square-foot building, which will house the Interactive Media Department for Games, the Institute for Multimedia Literacy and the interdivisional program in media arts and practice doctoral program.
Beaming · The highest beam on the new cinematic arts building, which will house the interactive media department, was installed on Saturday. - Yasamin Yeganeh | Daily Trojan
The building will be the first time the interactive media department has its own space.
Douglas Wellman, assistant dean of facilities and operations at the School of Cinematic Arts, said the new building features state-of-the- art technology, with flexible spaces designed to create an environment that is able to evolve based on the changing needs of the majors in the department.
“Flexibility is critical in this particular building due to the nature of these programs, which may radically change in the next four or five years,” Wellman said. “The space allows for it to adapt to whatever is on the horizon for these majors. It features colorful, comfortable, open experimentation space that can be reconfigured to meet whatever the current demands are.”
The construction plans for the new building involved input from faculty and students in the department.
“Faculty members came into committee meetings and communicated what needed to be included in this new facility, based on interaction with students,” Wellman said. “The faculty was very much aware and supportive of what students wanted.”
The initial plans and financial backing for the new building stemmed from filmmaker and USC alumnus George Lucas, who had intended for an interactive media building to be constructed when he made his initial donation to the School of Cinematic Arts.
“George Lucas is very much involved and was a big proponent of digital arts and technology way before any other filmmakers,” Wellman said. “His vision was to have a facility dedicated to these particular digital disciplines, which he feels is very important for equipping graduates with skills they will need in the field when they leave here.”
Tracy Fullerton, director of the Electronic Arts Game Innovation Lab and associate professor of the Interactive Media Division, said it is exciting to finally have a unified space where faculty is easily accessible and students in the department are able to interact with one another.
“Overall, the best part about it is that there is gong to be so much more space,” Fullerton said. “It will benefit students to work more closely with their peers and it will allow faculty members to be more accessible to students.”
The new space will feature more advanced technology and workspaces, which will enhance students’ overall learning experience, Fullerton said.
“The game innovation lab is moving over there and will be twice the size it was before,” Fullerton said. “Now we are also going to have a lab for all advanced game projects, a 3-D theater and a lab for graduate students, enabling them to have a place to work on projects all year long.”
Cinematic arts students said they are excited for the construction of the new building, realizing the importance for all majors in the school to have their own space, equipped with the latest technology to become leaders in the film industry.
Skye Optican, a junior majoring in critical studies, said the building is another example of the School of Cinematic Arts’ dedication to providing students with diverse spaces tailored to each major.
“It’s great that these majors finally get a creative space where they are able to work with one another more closely, interact and build projects together,” Optican said. “The cinema school buildings are equipped with the newest technologies in order to benefit students.”
The building is expected to be completed by January 2013.

Veronica Terriquez, a professor of sociology, spoke on civil and immigration rights as well as the influence of grassroots organizations for the last lecture in the What Matters to Me and Why speaker series at the Ground Zero Performance Café on Wednesday.
An L.A. native, Terriquez is the daughter of undocumented Mexican immigrants but said that she now identifies with the 1 percent — the 1 percent of Latinos with a doctorate. Terriquez received her doctorate in sociology from UCLA and has a background in educational equality and immigrant rights organization efforts.

“What matters to me is supporting social justice causes that fight for equal opportunities for immigrants, for low-income people of color, for gay people, for students here in the United States and the way I do this is through my research and teaching,” Terriquez said. “Specifically, I care about research that informs workers’ rights, immigration reform and student-led efforts for social change.”
Terriquez discussed civil rights history and said the civil rights movement played an important part in opening doors for her and her family. She said she credits Ella Baker, a black  civil rights activist, for fueling her passion for grassroots activism. Baker trained students, women and workers in civil and human rights activism for 50 years.
“I realized that much of my work examines her legacy,” Terriquez said. “My work looks at how everyday people — immigrants, workers and youths — employ the grassroots organizing techniques that Baker taught so many people, young and old. She was committed to students who tended to show great courage and steadfast commitment to their cause.”
Citing a historical example, Terriquez said the Watts Riots of 1965 led to greater pressure for integration in labor unions and factories. Her father felt the benefits of integration firsthand when he was allowed to join the United Steelworkers Union.
Terriquez said it meant her family was no longer poor.
As an undergraduate student at Harvard University, Terriquez said she met the real 1 percent and thanks activists before her for the Ivy League opportunity.
“I had the privilege of going to Harvard for my undergrad and I must say that I owe my acceptance into this university in great part to the civil rights movement that fought for racial integration and affirmative action that diversified institutions of higher education,” Terriquez said.
To be a part of a social movement, Terriquez moved to Oakland and became a community organizer. She said  there she learned firsthand the impact grassroots organizations have on the community.
One of her first research projects was a Justice for Janitors campaign that fought for fair wages and working conditions for janitors.
“I really care about research that can inform efforts to improve our immigration laws so that they’re fair to everybody,” Terriquez said. “The same opportunities should exist for many of the people who are here and who are undocumented.”
In what Terriquez calls a “nation of immigrants,” immigrant issues of equality, especially in youths, is at the forefront of her mind.
“I’m often moved by the work of students who really are at the vanguard, trying to change the world and trying to make it a better place,” Terriquez said.

With the California primary fast approaching, Geoffrey Cowan, director of the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism’s Center on Communication Leadership and Policy, moderated a discussion with political consultant Bob Shrum and journalist Marylouise Oates as part of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics’ Road to the White House series Wednesday.

Shrum, the author of No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner, and Oates, author of Making Peace, touched on issues concerning the primaries. Topics included the rise of super political action committees, the position of female and Catholic voters, America’s international pursuits and the prevalence of racism in  American society.
[Correction: An earlier version named Bob Shrum’s book No Excuses: Confessions of a Serial Campaigner. The title of his book is No Excuses: Concessions of a Serial Campaigner. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.]
Shrum discussed Santorum’s alienation of large groups of voters and Romney’s overly flexible nature in altering his political stances.
“Romney is on permanent probation, so whatever position he takes, it’s not in his playbook to be the anti-contraception campaign,” Shrum said. “There’s a huge gender gap that’s opened to women. Obama in swing states has taken a lead, and [Romney] has a 34 percent approval rating. It’s impossible to become president with an approval rating like this.”
Shrum also said taking moderate stances has been a challenge for Romney.
“He has a real difficulty in moving to the middle because it’ll amplify his character weakness — not flip-flopping, but saying everything he can to get there,” Shrum said.
Shrum also said Santorum’s attack on former President John F. Kennedy’s speech on religion was detrimental to his campaign.
“Santorum  attacked John Kennedy — that is not good for getting the Catholic vote,” he said.
Oates said both candidates have alienated women voters.
“If you look at the problems facing women around the world, no one has spoken about any of those issues on either side,” Oates said. “Nobody talked about trafficking, or any of the stuff that I see as a constant pressure on our country and other good countries to come back and fight against, such as violence against women, women as a weapon of war, female genital cutting.”
Oates also said Romney’s position in the campaign has been affected by the professional-amateur atmosphere of the blogosphere.
“You ask yourself, ‘How much does the Republican, Planned Parenthood woman who would have been a Republican voter know, where does she get her information, how is she making her decision’,” Oates said. “Santorum has lost the Catholic vote in every single primary state. Romney has become very Santorum-like, and women will probably reject Romney too.”
Shrum said foreign affairs are an unpredictable arena because of the uncertain nature of the Arab Spring, but he predicted that American troops would be removed from Afghanistan as scheduled.
“Wars are winding down and people are not in the streets about it,” Shrum said. “The demands of 2004 politically turned Afghanistan into the good war and Iraq was the bad war.”
With the recent shooting of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin, Shrum said race will play a critical role in the 2012 election.
“It was one of the proudest days when Obama was elected because racism is in our redemptive history,” Shrum said. “This election is going to settle a lot on whether we move forward or backwards in terms of race.”

Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum officials acknowledged Wednesday that they anticipate a modified lease between the Coliseum Commission and USC to be released within the next week.
The proposed lease, once finalized, will be subject to a final vote at the commission’s next monthly meeting on May 2 or at a later date.

USC has been in negotiations with the Coliseum’s nine-member governing body since September in an effort to obtain operational control of the state and federal landmark, which has been run by the commission for the last 88 years.
The university has been a tenant of the Coliseum since 1923, with the Trojan football team playing a majority of its home games at the 93,000-seat venue in Exposition Park.
“We hope that through these negotiations the parties can agree upon a long-term lease that allows the Coliseum to be restored to its former glory and ensures its viability for many generations to come,” said Thomas Sayles, USC’s senior vice president for university relations, in a statement released to the Daily Trojan. “Our goal is to make the Coliseum a proud landmark and gathering place for all Angelenos. We support public disclosure and discussion of all lease terms before any deal is approved.”
According to a lease draft obtained by the Los Angeles Times, USC would be responsible for staffing the facility, along with day-to-day management, event scheduling and other obligations over the next 42 years. It would also have the opportunity to manage the adjacent Los Angeles Sports Arena or to demolish the facility to construct a soccer-specific stadium or parking lot.
David Israel, president of the Coliseum Commission, and L.A. County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the Coliseum Commission, declined to comment on the proposed lease draft or the negotiations.
Under the proposal, the university would receive naming and advertising rights, which would provide a source of revenue needed to fund stadium renovations that are expected to cost several million dollars.
In June commission acknowledged that it could not afford to make the necessary improvements to the facility, as required by the existing 25-year lease, signed in May 2008.
USC will be expected to cover the costs of the new video board and sound system, as well, according to the Los Angeles Times.
City Councilmember Bernard C. Parks, a member of the Coliseum Commission and City Council Representative for the 8th District, said he has concerns about the potential of the Coliseum, a public facility, being run by a private entity, such as USC.
“It looks like ’SC wrote the lease and we just nodded,” Parks said.
USC has attempted to obtain the master lease before, lobbying in 2007 for operational control of the publicly owned venue before agreeing upon its current lease.
“It sets a precedent in the fact that folks are trying to work themselves out of a job,” Parks said. “They’re so intent on saying, ‘Well, USC is going to fix this, so let’s just give it to them.’ I think we’re losing sight of what the meaningfulness of the park and the facility is to the community, and they’re not taking that into account at all. The community deserves a bit more sensitivity.”
If USC obtains operational control of the Coliseum, public events could still be held at the facility, including the annual Fourth of July fireworks celebration, but the university would be given the option of limiting the number of events to eight per year, as outlined under the proposal.
USC would also have first-refusal rights if an NFL team were to want to use the facility while a stadium in Downtown Los Angeles is being constructed.

Even if you think you don’t think you read comics, there’s a pretty good chance that you do. Have you ever read xkcd or Dinosaur Comics? Those are comics, even if they don’t feature superheroes or come in the regular format.
Comic books have been around since the 1930s, but the industry began experimenting with the digital medium in the last half decade.

 
 
But even if a comic goes digital, it’s still the same comic, just transferred to a different medium. Webcomics are unique; they’re created specifically for the Internet. They really took prominence as the Internet began to popularize. They became noticeable in the 1990s, and with the rise of Web 2.0, they spread like wildfire.
This introduces webcomics to a new world of possibilities. There is an interaction between the creators and readers that isn’t possible with direct market comic books. Comment sections and creator blogs let the readers and creators talk, share feedback and sometimes exchange ideas for new strips.
These comics aren’t bound by the constraints of a particular medium, such as page shapes in printed comics, so they can be anything the creators can conceptualize. That means there can be comics as simple as the repeated art found in Dinosaur Comics, or the sometimes continuity-heavy yet non-sequitor- filled Penny Arcade.
And that leaves room for experimentation in serialization. Warren Ellis, known for his transhumanist and speculative series Transmetropolitan and Planetary, ran a five year-long webcomic series called FreakAngels. In the series, released weekly in six-page installments, a group of super-powered young adults live in a post-apocalyptic London. The series was groundbreaking — fans could go to the site every week to get more than just a strip and wouldn’t have to visit a comic book store to get the latest episode. Ellis’ experiment was bold, but it worked.
But webcomics offer more than a new creative frontier; they also explore the world of business. Even with the advent of the digital market, comics are found only in very specific areas. There are only so many comic book stores — unless someone is looking for a comic, comic book apps for gadgets aren’t something people jump to. And with bookstores such as Borders going out of business, the mainstream business avenues are failing.
But with a webcomic, it’s as simple as posting a link or forwarding it to a friend. Want to share the funny xkcd comic you found? Just post it on Facebook.
It’s advertising and distribution in the age of hypersharing and memes. And instead of marketing campaigns, it’s word of mouth that drives web traffic.
In a way, webcomics are a return to the earliest stage of comics. The longer comics on the market started out as collected editions of popular newspaper comic strips in the 1930s. With print newspapers struggling in recent years, a smaller market exists for those kinds of comic stories.
But so many series adopt the aesthetics and ethos of a newspaper comic strip: plot installment or joke — however small — told in a few panels. There is no room for decompression or padding because creators are good at conveying a story in a small space. And that’s what can be found in these webcomics, even longer ones such as FreakAngels.
But how will webcomics fit into the industry? Print comics, even with a small market and the adoption of the digital field, aren’t going anywhere in the near future. And yet, webcomics are growing. Perhaps there could be a sharing of talent; comic book creators could follow Ellis’ lead and experiment with the Internet while webcomic writers could try their hand at longform series. It would certainly be interesting to see.
Comics fans have complained that writers have decompressed storytelling to pad issues out, making them better suited for the trade paperback market. Maybe the compressed, to-the-point storytelling of webcomics could liven up the  print comic industry.
Are webcomics the future of comics? Most likely not, in the end-all, be-all sense. But growing along with the Internet and they have a far wider reach than the mainstream comics industry. Webcomics are a fun, new and concentrated spin on an old medium of storytelling, but they’re also experimental in a rewarding way and tend to be very entertaining.

Cowboy
Ongoing Exhibition
The Autry in Griffifth Park
Throw together the great American West, fine arts and a dash of John Wayne-esque cowboys and what do you get? Why, the Cowboy exhibition at the Autry Gallery in Griffith Park, of course.
From images of open-range Texas grasslands to the late-20th-century ranching period, the Cowboy Gallery celebrates cowboy culture and offers a look at the evolution of ranching iconography.
The Cowboy Gallery also offers images of the varying types of cowboys, from the Southwestern vaquero to the Northern cowboy, and the multiple methods of cowboying — think maintaining the ranch and rodeo.
Additionally, tools associated with cowboy culture, such as saddles and bridles, will be on display.
Admission is $6 for students with a valid school ID.
It might not be the Fourth of July, but any time is a good time to celebrate America.
 
Citizen Twain
Saturday, April 7; Sunday, April 8; Wednesday, April 11 
at 7 p.m. (additional matinee on Sunday at 2 p.m.)
Hollywood Forever
A one-man play about the life and trials of legendary American writer and satirist Mark Twain might not seem like an exciting way to spend a weekend evening. Thankfully, this isn’t the case when such a show lies in the experienced, capable hands of Val Kilmer — yes, the Kilmer of Top Gun, The Doors and Tombstone fame.
Citizen Twain is still considered to be in the “workshop” stage, and each performance wraps up with an open Q&A session with Kilmer. It’s an intriguing addition for anyone interested in the actor, who has been at once praised as a brilliant, dedicated performer as well as decried as “childish and impossible.”
Regardless of what his attitude might be, early reports seem to suggest that Citizen Twain is not to be missed; past performances have sold out, so get your tickets now.
 
Harvey/Donnie Darko Double-bill
Sunday, April 8, at 7:30 p.m.
Aero Theatre
If sitting through three-plus hours of cheesy one-liners and a giant boat sinking in 3-D sounds like a terrible way to spend your weekend, here’s another option: a double-feature of the 1950 Oscar-winning film Harvey and 2001’s cult classic Donnie Darko.
The former, adapted from the playwright Mary Chase’s play of the same name, features acclaimed actor Jimmy Stewart as Elwood P. Dowd. Disconcerting to those around him, Dowd’s best friend is a 6-foot-3 rabbit named Harvey that no one else can see. The latter is a sci-fi psychological thriller in which Jake Gyllenhaal, as Donnie Darko, must stop the world from ending — and, yes, sees an invisible rabbit that follows him around.
The combination of both films is sure to make for a great evening of cinema, and admission is only $11 — less than the price of one movie at many theaters around the city.
 
Titanic 3-D
In theaters now
Near, far, wherever you are, Titanic 3-D is inescapable.
James Cameron’s epic romance has been all over the news as of late: What will the film look like in 3-D? Better yet, is the re-release a greedy attempt to cash in on the same women who saw the film five times when it originally debuted?
Speculation is inevitable, but according to the production notes, “the conversion of Titanic is simply the next step in his [James Cameron’s] exploration of 3-D, and an ode to the film that he always wanted to be the most seamlessly immersive experience possible.”
As much of a public relations statement as this is, Titanic remains a huge cultural phenomenon, with $1.8 billion worldwide in revenue thus far and 11 Academy Awards.
For these reasons perhaps Titanic is worth a second watch on the big screen.

In the theater, anything can happen. At least that’s what Dr. Charles Augustus Leale claims in the opening minutes of Lincoln — An American Story, and frankly, it’s hard to fault his argument.
History lesson · Hershey Felder (above) delivers an astounding performance in Lincoln — An American Story, which draws attention to the underrated involvement of Dr. Leale in the aftermath of Lincoln’s assasination. - Photo courtesy of Craig Schwartz
After all, he holds a unique place in the American narrative. As the closest surgeon on hand during Ford’s Theatre’s infamously truncated production of Our American Cousin, he suddenly found himself responsible for the mortally wounded former President Abraham Lincoln in what became one of the most notable — and theatrical — assassinations in history.
Mostly overlooked until now, Leale is the focus of Hershey Felder’s one-man musical production, which dives into the past to provide a valid and surprisingly new perspective on one of the longest, darkest nights America has ever known.
The venue advances the story even before the play begins. The Pasadena Playhouse mimics Ford’s Theatre, and it’s to that very venue that Leale, in his Union garb with nothing onstage but a musket and a rocking chair, welcomes the audience. He delves into a brief retelling of his life story, a tale of a simple, good-hearted man that, were it not for this production, most of the audience would likely never have given a second thought to.
That’s because history, as taught in any classroom, is a story, and Lincoln’s death is one of the most widely explored chapters. Though someone obviously cared for the commander-in-chief on his deathbed, most accounts ignore who that person was. Lincoln addresses the caretaker’s identity in depth, fleshing out one of the “extras” of American history.
The subject matter evokes a great deal of passion from Felder, who, as playwright, composer and actor, pulls triple-duty for a story he feels needs to be told, or rather told from a different angle. This is Felder’s opportunity to show the effects of Lincoln’s death on the life of an ordinary man who, despite being caught up in the wheels of great events, was no different from anyone else in the Union. Lincoln was a titan to Leale just like everyone else; the surgeon is distinct only because he spent the longest night of his life cradling that titan’s bloody head in his hands.
Though that night certainly takes up the bulk of Leale’s life, some of his earlier anecdotes manage to be interesting because the events related won’t be as familiar to most viewers.
Most fascinating is an account of another theatrical performance Leale witnessed, a version of Julius Caesar starring the three Booth brothers — all legends of the stage and practically household names even before the youngest brother cemented his family’s legacy.
Indeed, seeing Hershey portray Leale’s take on John Wilkes Booth’s performance as Marc Antony — likely made far more sinister here than when originally acted, what with the gift of hindsight — one can’t help but realize that the man onstage is giving the very definition of a layered performance. For a one-man show, it’s best to go all out.
That’s not to say Felder is completely alone onstage. The background symphony removes any sense of isolation and imbues the performance with a grandiosity that, when paired with Felder’s gravitas, gives this lone performer a sense of mythos.
His songs, although brief, are lyrically adept and manage to work their way naturally into the production, something that might not be expected when you hear the words “one-man musical on Lincoln’s assassination.”
The projected effects lend the whole show a sort of big-budget flair and bring to this mock Ford’s Theatre the pillars of a Roman coliseum, the bustle of a 19th-century Washington, D.C. and, most breathtakingly, a starry night in which Leale relates the deeply emotional memory of a young soldier who died under his care.
This soldier’s name was lost to history, as were nearly all the identities of those who perished in America’s bloodiest chapter. That Leale was there to witness one of history’s most famous deaths is a coincidence; it could have been anyone in his place.
It’s a small bit of luck, then, that the duty fell to someone who Felder portrays as being just as greatly affected by the death of a soldier — quiet and uncelebrated — as he was by the demise of one of the greatest men ever to live.

[…] SWEET That’s not to say Felder is completely alone onstage. The background symphony removes any sense of isolation and imbues the performance with a grandiosity that, when paired with Felder’s gravitas, gives this lone performer a sense of mythos.  Michael Chasin – Daily Trojan […]

Newt Gingrich wants a colony on the moon by 2020. When Rick Perry was in the race, he managed to forget his plans for the Environmental Protection Agency in front of a national audience. And don’t even get me started on Rick Santorum.
Over the last couple of months, the Republican nominees have made American politics seem like a joke, pushing the Republican Party so far right that they’ve alienated most moderate voters.
They’ve done such a great job at being terrible, in fact, that I’ve come up with a theory: The Republican nominees are secretly Saturday Night Live cast members planning their most elaborate sketch to date.
Think about it. SNL has been making fun of politicians since the show first went on air, and in the 2008 election, Tina Fey’s performance as former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin made for one of the most memorable performances to date.
How could SNL ever top that? By actually running cast members in the primaries.
Improbable as my theory is, it does raise an important question: What has happened to American politics?
The Republican Party has made such an absurd effort to be the opposite of President Barack Obama administration that it has thrown reason out the window.
The party’s stubborn refusal to consider tax hikes — Romney, for example, takes pride in the fact that he cut taxes 19 times as the governor of Massachusetts — points to an impractically narrow political platform.
Whether or not you see tax increases as the best option, our country is more than $15 trillion in debt. Tax increases should at least be one option.
In an effort to further discredit the president, the Republican Party has even blamed President Barack Obama for problems outside his control. For example, while Romney campaigned in Wisconsin, he claimed that Obama “gets full … blame for what’s happened to this economy and what’s happened to gasoline prices under his watch.”
What Romney doesn’t acknowledge is that a world market for oil sets gas prices. Rising gas prices in America are in no way indicative of Obama’s performance.
Some of the nominees, lacking valid platforms on economic issues, have chosen to focus on social concerns in an effort to frame Obama as immoral.
Santorum has called for a return to “traditional American values.” When I think of traditional American values, I think of hard work and personal accountability. For Santorum, however, these “values” are predominately focused on shunning gay marriage and promoting religion.
It’s almost as if the Republican nominees are in a race to be the most stereotypical, by-the-book conservatives to gain the support of voters unsatisfied with Obama’s progress.
Given the irrelevant nature of the Republican Party’s attacks, Obama’s frustration is understandable. In response to a recent republican budget plan passed in the house, Obama claimed that the Republican Party has become so narrow-minded and radical that even Ronald Reagan would be unable to win a Republican Primary today.
Hopefully, the Republican nominees will move closer to the middle and flesh out their agendas to make the upcoming election more engaging. If they fail to do this and Obama wins, at least they might have backup careers as comedians.

Funny…I don’t recall the liberals describing how gas prices are set when President Bush was in office. How can you point fingers at republicans when you seem to be supporting the worst president in the history of this country.  At least give Palin credit when she said, “We don’t need somebody in the white house who is going to ‘find himself’ for the next four years.”
It is obvious that this man was extremely under qualified to take on this job and even my liberal friends admit they made a mistake voting for him.
Obama has surrounded himself with left wing academic people who think they know best how to run this country. This country was built on the backs of hard working independent people and this guy wants to CHANGE it into a country of dependent, the government knows whats best for you, people.
Just another Pathetic diatribe from an Ideological Zealot.
Have you ever considered moving to Cuba?
You don’t appreciate what you have & likely never will.
Sad.
Just another Pathetic (yes we capatilize the p) comment from a (big I!!)relevant (Triple wamee capitol: P!!)erson. have you ever considered making Sense?
You don’t appreciate what you are & likely never will.
Smiley Face :)!!
Burke… good assessment of how the Re[publican Party is “screwing the pooch” so to speak.  However, one of the main rules in politics, especially at this level is for the candidate to run as far right or left as they can stomach it for the primaries, then once nominated to represent their party, move towards the middle.
As a lifelong Democrat, I am very upset with what Obama has done to this country and the fact that he and his team of advisors have made so many rookie mistakes.  I didn’t’ vote for him and won’t in Nov, no matter who the Republican nominee is.  Obama is working towards the financial, social and emotional destruction of our country, and yes, you don’t want the country to be mired in the old ways of the establishment, but don’t you want to know that all the work, blood, sweat and tears our forefathers have put into building this country and keep us safe and the world safe from our enemies is going to continue?   I was young once, but I was smart enough, back in the day, to understand that we don’t want to give away the lifestyle and freedoms that my grandfather and father, and your great grandfathers fought for in WWII.  The country that was built by what is known as The Greatest Generation That Ever Lived, ie, the post WWII Americans, is now being completely taken apart by a man whose plans for Hope and Change are not beneficial to the citizens of this country, but detrimental to our way of life and future.  What is important for everyone to know is that we do not know who this man is.  What we do know is that he is going to give away our missile secrets to the Russians if reelected; he blackmailed Netanyahu to not attack Iran’s nuclear weapons facilities until after the election and if the Minister agreed with Obama, that he would provide Israel with all of the high tech weapons and bunker buster bombs needed to carry out the mission… to name a few things other than the social/racial divisionary tactics he is embracing.
Yes, the Republicans has had too much narrative about religion, but that’s because Obama has attacked religion.  People are very concerned over their Christian/Judeo religious rights being taken away by this Administration.  What about the Muslim rights?  Obamacare provides for Muslim rights to be adhered to, but not anyone else’s rights.  Why is that?  Why is it that Muslims do not have to participate in Obamacare, and nor does the federal gov employee and Congress, yet we are required to participate or be fined?  That sounds like a Muslim tactic of Sharia Law IMHO.
Yes, the Republicans have made it known that they’re against gay marriage and abortion.  That’s their party platform, but hey….  what are the concerns of today.  Not gay marriage nor abortion.  It’s how to get this country back on its feet economically, to be the economic power it once was, to provide a business friendly environment so that these businesses can create jobs for you, your friends, family and everyone else who is either unemployed, underemployed or not working at all and just gave up.  What about those whose entire lifestyle is based on living on federal and state entitlement money?  That lifestyle choice has to be ended.  Entitlement programs were designed to provide our citizens with help during hard times, until you could get back on your feet, after losing a job, being hurt, etc.  All Obama wants to do is to create more entitlement programs, so that these people become dependant wards of the state and not self-sufficient citizens.  This is the evil side of entitlement programs.  The government now can control what you do, and can manipulate your vote.  Once you’re hooke don federal money as a means of support, you’re hooked for a very long time and therefore, you are a slave to the government and its money.  this must stop.  At least, the Republican platform is to end entitelment programs, as best as can be reasonable, but also before doing so, to create the oppty for the people whose lives depend on this money to learn skills, get a job… any job at this point, and learn to be self sufficient.  there is no reason why it is considered acceptable for a woman to have a bunch of kids, from many men who do not support the kids, and live at a federally subsidized home, have the grandmother become the foster parent of her own grandkids, and both mom and grandmother bringing in $100,0000+ of federal and state entitlement money…. and drive a Mercedes E350, both.  Think I’m kidding?  I know this example as fact.
The Repubs want to change this mentality and help these folks move beyond being slaves to the government.  This is what the Dems has lost sight of over the past 30 years.  And yes, the Repubs are not the same party your parents were affiliated with either… It’s a shame, 
Let’s hope the Republicans get their act together soon and mount an effective campaign to beat Obama in Nov, because if Obama wins, he will be free to do whatever he wants, politically, and I am concerned that it won’t be pretty.
As an aside.  have you ever thought about why Hillary Clinton was magically pulled out of contention for the Dem nominee in 2008 and an absolute unknown just surpased her in the polls and won the election?
think about it for  a while.  it’s not what we’ve been led to believe…..
Oh hi ‘katman’, as a woman I’d say that women’s rights ARE a ‘concern of the day’, and are tightly related to economic concerns. Lately the Republicans have been passing all number of bills that affect women’s economic status. For example, Scott Walker of Wisconsin repealed the equal pay enforcement act, even though women in his state only get paid 3/4 as much as a man for the same job. Similarly, the House just passed a bill that would make it legal for a doctor to refuse to treat you in an emergency setting if it conflicted with their morals, or even transfer you to a different hospital. Which means that I could be paying for health insurance each month, and then show up at an ER and be left to die because the doctor doesn’t want to treat me. That’s not good economics (and it’s not good for my life). Similarly, the Blunt amendment was effectively an employer-enforced tax on birth control, even when used for non-pregnancy prevention purposes. Employees pay for the health insurance they get through their employer, so you shouldn’t be able to make these women pay AGAIN if their employer is super-religious. Women’s rights, easy access to affordable birth control, and the legalization of abortion, etc, are inherently tied to our economic interests, because it sure is hard to be independent and provide for your family if you are being paid less than a man, are charged more for your health insurance than a man (and now, with no guarantee of emergency services), and people are constantly trying to shut down avenues of access to low-cost contraceptives (ie, Planned Parenthood).
California also has plenty of debt, but we also have some of the highest tax rates in the Western USA. 
Looking across our worldwide competitors, we have gone from a low tax nation, full of innovation and prosperous, to a high tax nation where Google, Apple, & Microsoft spend millions of dollars to avoid billions in taxes. Lowering taxes makes it less desirable to use accountants, lawyers and other nations to avoid taxes. It is a question of economics. 
As for spending, it has increase an unprecedented amount in the last eight years. Wages and pensions for federal workers have gone from competitive to unsustainable. 
The answer is to evaluate what we as a people want our federal government to do. We need to confront the fact that the money for everything that federal government does, comes from us, the tax payers, and that the federal government’s costs for everything is significantly higher because of the massive borrowing (about 40 cents of every dollar spent). 
How long can we borrow and spend 40 cents of every dollar? Eventually there will be no buyers of our debts, as it will become increasingly obvious that we don’t intend to pay the money back.

If you’ve walked down Trousdale Parkway this week, you’ve probably seen statements like these on rows of colorful T-shirts.
Nick Cimarusti | Daily Trojan
The display is a part of USC Take Back the Night, a week “dedicated to promoting awareness of and protesting against sexual violence,” according to the event’s Facebook page. The week highlights one of the most egregious displays of sexism: rape.
Sexual assault is shockingly common throughout the United States, especially on college campuses. Those involved with Take Back the Night are brave for facing the problem head-on.
But we can’t just tackle sexism at its worst. We have to make note of when it crops up subtly in our everyday behavior.
At its core, sexism is about letting your view of someone as male or female cloud your view of him or her as a human being.
Can you come up with an example or two? I can come up with too many.
Disclaimer: The story that follows isn’t a description of a particular night so much as a multi-night mash-up.
I was talking to a friend at a party when a guy approached us. On the surface, he was polite. He didn’t leer, he didn’t invade our personal space and he made the effort to carry on an actual conversation — no small feat, as the DJ was blasting Skrillex.
Then, I put on my sweatshirt. The guy smirked and came up with this gem: “Man, when a girl puts on a hoodie, she’s totally out of commission for the night.”
Oh, really? Did it occur to you that I might be cold? Cool.
In this guy’s mind, the fact that we were women overrode everything else about us. But I’m willing to bet that if he had talked to us as fellow students first, he would have been met with less eye-roll.
Let it be said that women are perfectly capable of the same kind of sexism. From time to time, I fall into the trap of thinking, “God, what now?” when I get approached by men at parties.
But just as not all men are sexual predators, not all men are jerks. To make that assumption is to screen out plenty of decent people.
In the grand scheme of things, do the categories “male” and “female” have to matter this much? Biological differences between the sexes exist, but we’re all basically hairless apes. We share more than 99 percent of the same genes and most of the same needs. Still, we’re surrounded by reminders of the supposedly rigid split between men and women.
Before we’re even born, parents buy bedding, clothes and toys that correspond to our sex; blue or pink, toy trucks or toy ovens. When we get older, the media bombards us with similar messages. Cosmopolitan is full of titles like “4 Things Guys Keep Private” and “Why Guys Dump Girls They Dig.” AskMen.com publishes countless guidelines on talking to women — not all people, just women.
Do we really have to reinforce these divides again and again?
Think about handbooks that teach you how to interact with natives in a foreign country. Sure, basic guidelines are helpful, but taking them too literally is a bad idea.
What if you went to Europe and people assumed you’re loudmouth because of a bullet point they read somewhere about Americans? That’s how I feel when people make assumptions about me because I happen to have the capacity to give birth.
Sexist assumptions aren’t as dramatic as sexist violence, but that’s no excuse to let them slide.
I won’t launch into a feminist tirade if a guy holds a door open for me. All the same, I hope he’s holding it open for men, too.

The trailer for Woody Allen’s To Rome with Love has finally been released.
The romantic comedy is Allen’s follow-up to Midnight in Paris, his most successful film to date, which has earned $148 million worldwide at the box office. The film also won Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards, securing Woody Allen his fourth Oscar.
To Rome with Love stars exciting newcomers into the world of Woody Allen, including Roberto Benigni, Jesse Eisenberg and Ellen Page, as well as returning visitors, including Alex Baldwin, Penélope Cruz and Judy Davis.
The trailer for the film captures the beauty of Rome through its cinematic postcard imagery, as well as its comical and romantic situations that arise from the tourists.
The one-liners in the film are sharp and clever, and many come from the filmmaker himself, who appears in his first acting role since 2006. In one instance in the trailer, he makes a remark to his wife (Judy Davis) about his 150-160 IQ range, to which she replies, “You’re figuring it in Euros. In dollars, it’s much less!”
The film consists of four vignettes and several of the characters come off as extraordinary. Penélope Cruz appears for the second time in a Woody Allen film, after having won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in Vicky Cristina Barcelona. In this film, she takes on the role of an eager prostitute. Ellen Page plays a young adventurous girl who men swoon over because of the “sexual vibe” she gives off.
The trailer for the film is filled with comedy and promises, and hopefully some of the charm from Paris will be carried into Rome as well.
To Rome with Love is scheduled for release on June 22, 2012.
I saw the movie “to roma with love” and was impressed by the opening scene when a police officer (Mr. Pierluigi  Marchionne) begins the film with a great piazza venezia rome postcard. A brilliant idea Mr. woody allen with the narrator who accompanies and unites the four stories of the film.
