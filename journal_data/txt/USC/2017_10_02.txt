Students were evacuated from campus following reports of gunshots in Fertitta Hall.Tal Volk | Daily Trojan
Reports of gunfire at Fertitta Hall triggered a police response and sent students fleeing the campus Monday afternoon. Following an hour-long, campus-wide lockdown, no evidence of a shooting was found and an adjunct professor was detained for a mental health evaluation after reportedly falsely telling students there was an active shooter, according to the Los Angeles Police Department and the Department of Public Safety.
“It was reported a faculty member during class falsely told her students there was an active shooter in the building. The faculty member has been detained by the LAPD,” DPS Chief John Thomas said in an email to the Daily Trojan.
Christopher Rawlings, an undecided sophomore, said his instructor, Amy Granados, falsely reported gunshots while teaching a business class in Fertitta Hall. Rawlings said that Granados fled from the room, saying she was going to get help, leaving the students alone in the room for an hour before the police released them from the room.
“A lot of us were very hesitant about whether it was a drill or not,” Rawlings said. “I, for one, just thought it was a drill and that she was acting the whole time. But as time went on and I was getting messages from everyone asking if I was OK … it became more and more real to the people in the room.”
Rawlings said Granados, an adjunct professor of management and organization, had seemed agitated from the beginning of class.
“She was for some reason worried that people were in [Las] Vegas and may have been injured and whenever someone would come in she would be relieved that they were okay because they had come to class,” Rawlings said.
Brandon Kaufman, a freshman majoring in business administration, was in the same class as Rawlings. He said when he arrived to class, his instructor seemed distraught and upset over Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas. 
About five minutes into class, according to Kaufman, the instructor said she heard gunshots and ordered the students in the class to barricade the door. 
“Eventually she ran out of the room and there was a police officer that came at one point and she was like, ‘Don’t shoot, don’t shoot,’” Kaufman said. “She eventually left the room running out, [saying] ‘help, help, help.’”
LAPD said that a call of a possible active shooter came out at 12:17 p.m., but later confirmed that no shots were fired and no injuries were reported.

Thomas said that the University issued a ‘police activity/shelter in place’ alert at 12:23 p.m. on its Trojans Alert emergency notification system.
“Thanks to the rapid response of the USC Department of Public Safety and LAPD, we were able to quickly verify that there was no active shooter,” Thomas said in the email. “LAPD and DPS continue to investigate what events led to the initial reports.”
LAPD officers went room by room in Fertitta Hall until about 1 p.m., working to clear the building as students and employees who had not evacuated locked themselves inside classrooms. 
Remy Porsella, a junior majoring in economics and mathematics, says he was in Fertitta Hall when he heard screaming and saw hundreds of people running out the doors. 
“It was full panic,” Porsella said. 
Umar Farooq, a senior majoring in business administration, was also in Fertitta Hall at the time of the evacuation and livestreamed on Periscope as he evacuated.
“I wanted to help, but I couldn’t so the only thing I could do was livestream,” Farooq said. “This was probably the first time ever in class where I truly felt scared especially with what happened last night [in Las Vegas].”
Helicopters circled around the building, while SWAT was on scene to investigate. 
Provost Michael Quick addressed the incident in a statement emailed to the student body on Monday afternoon. 
“As members of the Trojan Family, we also should be mindful of the needs of others,” Quick said. “If you observe a fellow student, faculty, or staff member who may be in need of support, you can reach out confidentially through Trojans Care for Trojans, an initiative within the Office of Campus Wellness and Crisis Intervention.”

CORRECTION: A previous version of this post incorrectly stated that Amy Granados is an adjunct professor of management communication. She is actually an adjunct professor of management and organization.
Fire that professor!
Did the administration know that this professor was having troubles and still let her teach class?
Just another reason we need to close down the Greek system.

In a waiting area outside the weight room adjacent to where USC’s team buses were parked following its upset loss to Washington State on Friday in Pullman, Wash., offensive coordinator Tee Martin faced the media and delivered a series of terse, one- to two-word answers.
Did he feel like receivers were getting open consistently? “No.” Why was it hard for USC to get a rhythm on offense? “They’re good,” he responded, referring to the Cougars’ defense. How did he think the blown offensive pass interference call on redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns affected the outcome? “No excuses.” Or the numerous injuries to the offensive line? “No excuses.” And how would he assess his own performance? “We didn’t win a game,” he said.
It was that kind of night, for Martin and for the rest of the team. But it wasn’t like we couldn’t have seen this coming. In a season that thus far has been underwhelming for USC despite entering Friday’s contest with a 4-0 record, a loss like this was bound to happen. The Trojans did just enough to win those four contests, but within each game still had issues to fix — specifically on offense — and concerns piling up for a team expected to compete for a national championship. It seemed, to an extent, USC’s offense had been “bailed out” in those wins – by electric running backs in junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr, by the defense, and by some lucky breaks.
But on Friday, playing a road game on short rest in front of a packed house at Martin Stadium, no one bailed out the Trojans — not even Super Sam.
Friday night brought about a much-needed dose of reality for this team and drove home the cold, hard truth: USC isn’t what we thought it would be. Good team? Sure. Talented? Absolutely. Top-10 program? Probably.
But to be a national championship contender, it has a lot of work ahead, and it starts with Martin’s offense.
Up until Friday, USC had been able to ride redshirt sophomore Sam Darnold’s coattails because he was just that good. His athleticism and creativity masked many of the problems the Trojans may have had offensively, whether it be a shaky offensive line or the wide receivers having an off-night. But Darnold cannot do it all. He cannot block and pass at the same time, nor can he throw and catch the ball by himself.
Against Washington State, with a makeshift offensive line and two of his top three wide receivers injured, it was clear that the task was too Herculean, even for Darnold.
Instead of the veteran blockers he was accustomed to, he watched as junior right tackle Chuma Edoga turned his ankle and senior right guard Viane Talamaivao hurt his left shoulder. With redshirt junior left tackle Toa Lobendahn already out with a staph infection, plugging in two freshmen — Austin Jackson and Andrew Vorhees — along with redshirt sophomore Clayton Johnston had to fill in the other spots.
On the receiving corps, Darnold did not have the services of redshirt senior Steven Mitchell Jr., who had a groin injury, and redshirt junior Jalen Greene left the game at halftime. And redshirt sophomore tight end Daniel Imatorbhebhe remains out with a hip flexor.
Even with all those players healthy earlier this season, USC’s offense struggled at times, though Darnold still managed to put up decent numbers. But against Washington State, the preseason Heisman favorite was downright pedestrian. His 52 percent completion rate (15-of-29) was the lowest of his USC career, as were the 164 yards he threw for. He misfired on several passes, either overthrowing or miscommunicating with the receiver. On Darnold’s lone interception, he badly underthrew redshirt freshman wide receiver Josh Imatorbhebhe, with the defender able to read his eyes.
Some of that is Darnold’s own fault. But it’s also the larger offensive scheme as a whole. The offense overall was anemic in Pullman. There was no flow, no rhythm whatsoever, and questionable play-calling to boot for a team that is supposedly “run first” and has two premier running backs. USC had as many run plays as throws — 29 each — which is nonsensical considering the pass game was getting nowhere. Redshirt freshman Tyler Vaughns was the only receiver who had any kind of night catching the ball — and perhaps the lone bright spot for the Trojans on Friday. But for Carr to only have five carries for 11 yards and for Jones to only have one memorable run — the 86-yard touchdown gallop in the first half — is to play right into the defense’s hands.
Instead of trying to be cute, such as attempt a flea-flicker in the second quarter that led to an intentional grounding penalty and a momentum shift, Martin needs to stick to plain and simple. It’s tempting to try and be elaborate, especially given the talent he has on the offense from the quarterback to the young receivers to the running backs. But sometimes, less is more, and calling basic run plays or screen passes or simpler routes can be more effective than trick plays — and if something breaks down, Darnold is still that wild card who can improvise.
Out of all the dumb clichés in sports, the worst is “defense wins championships” because a good defense with a bad offense won’t even make the playoffs. Right now, USC’s offense is — for lack of a better term — bad. The only thing saving it is Darnold’s talent, and as we saw against Washington State, even that is not good enough when the injury bug hits. So, it’s up to Martin to make the adjustments, to call the right plays and build an offense that doesn’t revolve around Darnold having to save the day in every fourth quarter.
“He did a really good job,” Martin said when asked about Darnold’s play on Friday. “Made some good reads. He put us in position to win the game, just fell short.”
Sam Darnold is doing his job. It’s time for Tee Martin to do his.
Eric He is a junior studying journalism. He is also the associate managing editor for the Daily Trojan. His column, Grinding Gears, runs Mondays. 
“Sam Darnold is doing his job. It’s time for Tee Martin to do his.”  martin’s a great position coach and recruiter, but he sucks at being an OC.  unfortunately, he’s a terrible example as well; he threw the players under the bus and couldn’t just admit he failed and that he needs to do a lot better.

No. 5 USC entered Friday night’s contest against No. 16 Washington State in Pullman, Wash., with a perfect record, national championship aspirations and a chance at proving it was the undeniable king of the Pac-12.
It left with its first loss, its odds at the College Football Playoff shrunken considerably and its reign on the conference in question.
In front of a raucous crowd of over 33,000 at Martin Stadium that poured onto the field after the final whistle, the Trojans struggled to find their game. Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold, with a ravaged offensive line protecting him, was not his usual self, and a late fourth-quarter flash was not enough.
In fact, it was a mistake by Darnold, with USC down a field goal in the final minutes that ended the game. He made a weak attempt to toss the football ahead to avoid a sack, but it wound up a fumble and a recovery by Washington State.
On this night, it was Washington State’s time to shine. Tickets, even standing room only, were sold out for this game. Before kickoff, the public address announcer hyped up the crowd by boasting the game was being broadcast on national television.
And on the big stage, it was Pullman’s Cougars who bested Los Angeles’ Trojans, 30-27. It snapped USC’s 13-game win streak dating back to last season, its first loss in more than a calendar year.
“We’ve got a bunch of hurt kids in that locker room right now,” head coach Clay Helton said. “It’s been awhile since we’ve felt this, and it hurts.”
Redshirt senior safety Chris Hawkins even became emotional.
“I cried, honestly, in the locker room,” he said. “It hurt.”
With time winding down in the fourth, the Cougars marched downfield thanks to a 35-yard run by running back Jamal Morrow. A 32-yard field goal by Erik Powell served as the eventual game-winner.
It came after Darnold, who had been struggling all night long, found a connection with redshirt freshman wide receiver Tyler Vaughns to tie the game. On 4th-and-13 at the 42-yard line, Darnold found the receiver in traffic for the conversion. And on the next play, he hit Vaughns again to set up first-and-goal. He finally punched in a two-yard touchdown run to even the score with five minutes left in regulation.
But he didn’t have enough in the tank for another two-minute drill a la Texas, though everyone, including Darnold himself. expected him to pull another rabbit out of his hat.
“I thought it was automatic points,” Hawkins said. “One of the best quarterbacks in the country. Whether it be 3 or 7 [points], I thought we were going to score regardless.”
The Cougars pulled ahead in the fourth quarter on a masterful drive by Falk, who converted several third downs and a fourth down and finally found Morrow on a shovel pass for a 23-yard score to put Washington State in front 27-20.
Falk finished with 340 yards on 34-of-51 passing, outplaying Darnold, who was 15-of-29 for 164 yards. Washington State finished 8-of-18 on third downs, while USC only converted two of their 11 third-downs attempts.
“It ends up costing us a lot of plays defensively,” Helton said.
Falk was also effective in making adjustments.
“There were times when we would change something and he would change something back,” junior linebacker Cameron Smith said. “Pretty smart guy.”
The two teams traded field goals in the third quarter, with neither settling into an offensive flow. There were punts, penalties, reviews and stoppages as the game grinded to a halt and the teams entered the fourth quarter tied 20-20.
In contrast, USC’s offense looked sharp to start the game, as Darnold marched the team down on a 10-play, 75-yard drive that ended in a touchdown. It was the Trojans’ most efficient drive of the half, and it ended with a four-yard touchdown run by Darnold after he had scampered for nine yards on the previous play to set up first-and-goal.
But then the offense sputtered, and the injuries started piling up. The Trojans already came into the game banged up. USC was without redshirt senior wide receiver Steven Mitchell Jr. (groin) and redshirt junior guard Toa Lobendahn (staph infection) in addition to junior linebacker Porter Gustin (toe/bicep). Then, late in the first quarter, junior offensive tackle Chuma Edoga appeared to hurt his left leg and was replaced by freshman offensive tackle Andrew Vorhees. And senior offensive guard Viane Talamaivao appeared to hurt his shoulder early in the second quarter. USC was down to two healthy starting offensive lineman for the remainder of the game.
Injuries, though, serve as nothing but a pity call.
“Nobody’s going to have any sympathy for us,” Hawkins said. “We’re injured across the board. Nobody’s going to say anything about that.”
Darnold added that it came down to simply performing.
“We knew what they were going to do,” he said. “It was just a matter of executing at that point, and they out-executed us.”
The offensive line issues didn’t help Darnold, who couldn’t find a rhythm and threw several questionable balls and one interception in the first half. He was bailed out only by an explosive 86-yard touchdown run by junior running back Ronald Jones II that put the Trojans ahead 14-10 in the second quarter. It was the longest touchdown run by a USC running back since 1996.
Still, USC looked to have all the momentum when, on Washington State’s ensuing possession, Falk’s pass was tipped and intercepted by senior linebacker Uchenna Nwosu inside the five-yard line. But Darnold and Co. could not capitalize, settling instead for a field goal and a 17-10 advantage.
It allowed the Cougars to hang around and tie the game at halftime. Falk had a strong first half, and the USC secondary allowed several big plays. Down 7-3 early in the second quarter, Falk dumped a screen pass off to wide receiver Tavares Martin Jr., who had nothing but clear space ahead of him for a 28-yard touchdown. And right before halftime, Falk led the Cougars on a 12-play, 94-yard drive that started from their own six-yard line and was aided by a few pass interference penalties by the Trojans. Morrow pounded it in from a yard out to tie the game at the half.
The Trojans are sure to slip in the rankings, and will have to win out in order to get back into the playoff conversation. But for now, the focus shifts to next week and Oregon State at home
“They’re probably not going to be happy to play us after this one,” Hawkins said.

Midway through a day at my internship, standing in line at a taco shop with a list of orders in my hand, my mind started to wander to an old PBS show I used to watch as a kid. Set in the midst of the American Revolution, a young man works as an apprentice in Benjamin Franklin’s print shop and is provided lodging and meals in return — Ben’s a good guy, after all. But back in my 2017 reality, I juggled two credit cards, attempting to explain to the cashier that all orders but one were to be put on the company Visa. Later that day, I took an $8 Uber to the Metro station to get home.
Fortunately, my internship didn’t ask for proof of academic credit, so I was able to avoid the additional $3,466 tuition it would cost to overload on course units at USC — though it would have fulfilled a requirement for my major. Many employers, however, expect interns to receive academic credit.F or this to happen, USC policy requires that students enroll in the internship class and pay tuition for the opportunity to get necessary job experience — an extra cost that is an impossible barrier for many.
Sharonda Laticia Harris-Marshall, who graduated from USC in 2008 with a degree in film and entertainment, saw her career suffer as a result. 
“I couldn’t afford to intern in college,” Harris-Marshall told me. “Not only did I have to work two work-study jobs, but I also had to miss a year of school due to finances.” 
Once she graduated, she found that most companies required previous internships. “I was usually offered an ‘internship’ instead of the paying job I was applying for,” she said. “I did end up reading scripts for two years for a company, but I wasn’t paid for it.”
The academic credit requirement is put in place to assure that the internship is a valid educational experience, but a concern is that companies can employ this as justification not to pay their interns. The U.S. Department of Labor stipulates that in order for an internship to be exempt from minimum wage laws, the employer must not derive “immediate benefit” from the work of the intern. The national conversation on the legality and fairness of unpaid internships is raging on, but the role that universities play in the process is one that must be examined. 
USC’s course catalog offers 23 undergraduate internship classes through different schools, and each set a specific internship policy. The funds from the class tuition go directly to the schools, says Lauren Opgenorth, USC Career Center’s associate director of internships and experiential education. 
“Some other universities come up with other alternatives such as having courses included with the cost of tuition,” Opgenorth said. “There are other different ways to do it, but it has to be something that is university-endorsed. This is the way USC manages it, and so our solution to it was, ‘Alright, we’re going to come up with scholarships.’ We know that it can’t touch everyone, but at least it makes a little bit of a mark.”
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
USC offers 15 scholarships through the Career Center every summer in an attempt to increase accessibility. The Dream Dollars program funds undergraduate students who secure unpaid internships with nonprofits or government organizations and the First Generation Scholars Program supports those who are the first in their family to attend college. Each scholarship provides $1,500 to $2,000 to be used at the discretion of the recipient for the expenses of unpaid internships such as travel, rent or tuition. Opgenorth wishes more were possible. 
It’s ultimately up to the companies to decide whether or not to pay their interns, but universities that charge on top of this create an uneven playing field for students who are at an economic disadvantage. Universities such as Harvard and Columbia have found that the answer is to stop giving credit for internships. Columbia’s website explains that while internships are valuable experiences, “We expect companies to appropriately compensate students for work performed during internships.” 
Though it might initially appear to limit opportunities, the move might pay off for students in the long run. A survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that students who previously held paid internships with private, for-profit companies received the highest job offer rate at 72.2 percent. Of those with unpaid internships, just 43.9 percent received offers, compared to 36.5 percent for those who had no internship at all. Another option is to follow Georgia Tech’s lead and allow students to audit the internship class tuition-free. 
USC might do well to look to these leaders in the fight toward fairness in employment opportunities. The University’s current tuition requirement for the internship class is a “negative wage” and a system by which USC is complicit in creating unequal opportunities. It stacks privilege on top of privilege for those who can afford it, and its effects carry over into the post-college lives and careers of all students, reinforcing barriers that USC has worked hard to eliminate in the admissions process and in building a diverse student population.

With the return of college rankings and prospective student tours flooding campus, it’s officially the season for college applications. While many students hone in on academics, social life and career opportunities when considering where to pursue their higher education, campus dialogue and activism have become significant selling points to high school seniors, who are coming to campus more politically engaged than in past decades.
But here at USC, the case for a socially conscious campus falls flat. On the college prep website Niche, in response to the question “What political party do you associate yourself with?” the second highest response for USC students was “I don’t care about politics.”
These responses constitute more than online opinions or anomalies. While UC Berkeley was embroiled in Free Speech Week, USC is still struggling with incomplete speech — a lack of productive discourse that renders students apathetic at best, and misled, at worst.
We could discuss the dialogue around free speech and social justice at USC, if there even was one. Though no one is clamoring for the riot police and barricades of Berkeley, no freshman, no matter how naïve and confused, mistakes USC for a hub for activism, political discussion and social advocacy.
Though the University has branded itself as a hub of the liberal arts, no amount of riveting classroom Socratic seminars can fill the campus discourse void. Our school is defined not by what we have but rather what we lack, whether that means no campus debates between student political groups or few options in terms of literary and political magazines.
Incomplete speech begins with a lack of dialogue but often ends with stunted discussion. For example, thanks to the propagation of memes and incomplete information about USC Village available on social media, many students now characterize USC’s relationship with the local community solely in terms of gentrification.
USC Village not only expanded the bounds of our campus, but it should have also expanded the bounds of our discourse. Instead, when the gates close at 9 p.m. so too does our willingness to engage with inconvenient truths.
Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
The social media posts and campus conversations hit some of the right notes when discussing the economic gentrification propagated by the USC Village, or the crowding out of local businesses and increasing the prices of retail for our neighbors. But missing from sweeping generalizations about the administration’s relationship with and commitment to the community was the mention of millions given to local affordable housing projects, the relocation fees given to displaced businesses, the local hiring program during and after construction and the lighter economic burden that increased on-campus housing and fewer students raising rents nearby bring to the community.
We’ve reduced our meaningful action to memes and our substantive opinions to sound bites. And in the process, the entire campus loses its ability to critically engage with our community, our world and ourselves.
And missing from these online debates and muttered accusations: a candid discussion surrounding students’ obligations to our neighbors and the role that we play in developing and interacting with the community. Maybe it’s time to start a dialogue around whyin 2016, Washington Monthly ranked USC no. 161 in service while UCLA checks in at 52 and UC San Diego, 21.
The aforementioned Niche website asks students, “What one word or phrase best describes the typical student at this school,” and for USC,  “busy and active” takes the prize. But this raises the question: If we’re so much in motion, why can’t we serve others, discuss our past, present and future and reflect on our actions and impact?
It takes a village to rectify our incomplete speech. It takes a USC Village to even spark the conversation. But it’s up to us to form and shape our campus dialogue. At a university where every week is Incomplete Speech Week, it’s time for a change — and a candid conversation.

Alec writes, “. . . here at USC, the case for a socially conscious campus falls flat.” What does that mean? It means no disruptive and violent protests, no suppression of speakers, if the speaker may not be to the liking of extremist students. It means no idiotic exclusion of others, when minorities, LGBTQ or religious groups meet. Most of all, it means that students can go about their academic, social and athletic lives at USC, and the learning, degrees and careers that they are pursuing. It means an atomosphere of calm, instead of fear and stress. Schoolwork is stressful enough.
I know that back during the turbulent late 60’s and early 70’s, UCLA, Cal and other excellent universities had violent riots, takeover of academic and administrative buildings, extensive vandalism and all sorts of nastiness from student troublemakers. Those kinds of students sought an outlet for their alienation, anger and anti-social tendencies. At the start of the 1970 school year, four Univ. of Wisconsin students bombed the math building, killing one and severely injuring three others. They objected because their school hosted Army research into mathematics.

I hope that Alec is correctAlec writes, “. . . here at USC, the case for a socially conscious campus falls flat.” What does that mean?

Photo from USC School of Dramatic Arts
Multicolored lights engulf the room. A dance breaks out onstage as Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” blasts in the background. Challenging theatrical norms from the very beginning, this sequence opens into a moving tale about American slavery.
The School of Dramatic Arts put on a production of Branden Jacobs-Jenkins’s An Octoroon, a satirical yet harshly real examination of modern race relations through a 19th-century lens. Directed by Anita Dashiell-Sparks, the sold-out show kicked off the drama production season, running from Sept. 28 to Oct. 1 at the McClintock Theatre. 
The central purpose of An Octoroon — to deconstruct human behavior as it relates to ethnicity and culture — is relatively straightforward, but to unpack the plot of the play is a challenge in itself. The production begins with a speech from Jacobs-Jenkins (Rahjul Young) himself, who confesses his struggles to grasp what it means to be a black playwright in society. Another playwright (Dominic Piccinini), this one white, steps into the scene, belittling his problems. This promptly begins an intense, uncomfortable swearing match between the two artists. 
Jacobs-Jenkins then shifts the focus to a Louisiana plantation in 1859. George (Rahjul Young), heir to the Terrebonne Plantation, falls in love with Zoe (Cherie Carter), the daughter of George’s uncle and a slave. Although Zoe has lived a relatively privileged life growing up in the house with a proper education, she acknowledges that she and George cannot be together due to the fact that she is an “octoroon,” or a person who is one-eighth black. The rest of the play deals with the damaging emotional implications of the pair’s star-crossed love, as well as the stories of the plantation’s humorously eccentric group of slaves. 
As mentioned before, the production does justice to the complexities of what it means to be black in a white-dominated world. Instead of asking how we as a society — or in this case, an audience — can heal the discord between different ethnic identities, Jacobs-Jenkins questions whether such a social issue is even solvable.
Such issues are approached in a skillfully unorthodox fashion. Acknowledging that we fundamentally dismantle and analyze racial stereotypes by placing ourselves in the position of the “other,” the production controversially uses the elements of “whiteface,” “redface” and “blackface” on characters George, Wahnotee (Dominic Piccinini) and Pete (Cattien Le), respectively. 
“The thing that struck me so profoundly was that none of the actors were putting on the face of the culture they identify with,” Dashiell-Sparks said. “To have the transformation take place in front of the audience’s eyes and the other characters’ eyes was very important.”    
Another interesting production choice was, in fact, not an element of the story at all. The seats were arranged in a manner reminiscent of a tennis match, with two crowds of spectators facing each other, the play’s action separating them. As a result, discomfort was created as audience members’ reactions to the play’s hot-button topics were monitored as closely as the actors themselves.
“The audience being able to be a reflective mirror for each other, sitting across from each other in this gallery setup, was so crucial along the themes of accountability and what it means to bear witness to the things that are occurring,” Dashiell-Sparks said. “Do we take action? Do we speak? Do we remain silent? And why?” 
However, this tension was expertly broken up by the comedy embedded in the play’s dialogue. For instance, after finding out that the rest of the slaves fled the plantation without her, sassy servant Minnie (Julissa Merius) remarks, “I did not wake up thinkin’ this was where my day was gonna go.” She later dresses up in gold stilettos to impress the buyers at a slave auction, gloating to fellow servant Grace (Gabrielle Rosser), who earlier called her “ghetto.” The production makes use of numerous references to modern culture to hint at the immediacy of the play’s themes, as evidenced by the use of West’s song. 
“One of the things that helped us to be inside those heavy themes was the irony, the wit, the satire,” Dashiell-Sparks said. “It was almost like the playwright gave us a gift of that space of play and interaction and levity to dive into the harshness and gritty realities of what it was like to live in these conditions.”
But what truly communicates these messages is the absence of the fourth wall. Characters frequently involve audience members in their dilemmas, even physically moving them onstage to be a part of the production themselves. In a sense, the lessons of the play are not preached; they are experienced. 
“I think [breaking down the fourth wall] was very impactful because you as an audience member are a participant in the story as it is unfolding,” Dashiell-Sparks said. “It constantly forces us to take down our boundaries and to break down our bias, our prejudice. It allows us to be uncomfortable and understand why we are uncomfortable in any given moment in the play.” 
Boldly unapologetic and hilarious in its own right, An Octoroon is a nuanced, introspective production that forces people to consider how they make judgments, understand and love each other. In a nutshell, as a disembodied narrator announced in closing, “the whole point of this thing was to make you feel something.” And that it did.

The magic of Sandra Cisneros’ 1984 novel The House on Mango Street is its intimacy; though the world may seem foreign, dark at times and sparkling at others, the characters seem like family. The play follows a year in the life of a young Chicana, Esperanza (played by the gracious Elizabeth Nungaray), as she comes of age in a world ridden with racial tension, poverty, issues of sexuality and violence. Her journey is expressed in vignettes, the interconnectedness of which is conveyed poignantly through a talented ensemble whose members interchangeably play Esperanza’s neighbors, friends and family. Adapted for the stage by Amy Ludwig and directed by Alexandra B. Meda, Greenway Arts Alliance’s The House on Mango Street captures the grandiosity of Cisneros’ prose while carefully balancing the contemporary relevance of its larger themes through the intimacy of its performance.
Ludwig’s adaptation presents two versions of Esparanza, a young and an old, which supplement each other’s story of what happened. The Fun Home-esque narrative style works seamlessly to underscore the unified nature of past and present in a way that dissolves the linearity of time. When telling the tragic story of her friend Sally’s sexual assault, the audience witnesses a heartwarming moment of the two Esparanzas coming together, embracing as the younger one weeps. The older Esparanza, played by the powerful Estela Garcia, braids the younger’s hair and wipes away her tears as they sit center stage. The scene highlights the hopeful fertility of storytelling — the boons of a wound — reminding us that no matter the circumstances, there will come a time to coddle the child within, and to make memories less haunting.
What accentuated the power of the performance was how in tune both Nungaray and Garcia were with each other. Aside from a few minor dialogue hiccups, the pair delivered much of Cisneros’ original prose with the intensity and grace of spoken word poets.
A certain childish gaiety perfaced the play, a facet that lay principally in the hands of ensemble members Graciela Lizet Rodriguez and USC alumnus Christine Marie Mantilla. The two drove various scenes that explored girlish curiosity and fear about what awaited them in the faraway world of womanhood. The girls giggled about how their hips would “bloom like roses” with pregnancy, dipped their feet in the world of dangerous flirtation while tip-toeing the streets in a neighbor’s old heels, and made up their minds that they would not be one of those women who “sit their sadness on their elbow.” Perhaps some credit for the play’s streak of joyful innocence should go to costume designer Beryl Brachman. With sunflowers in her hair and peach overalls, Esperanza appeared radiant with curiosity despite the underlying tragedy of her stories. Rodriguez was also exceedingly captivating in pink skinny jeans and a baby blue hoodie-like garment.
With a minimalistic set and complete lack of props, the play revolved around a bleak, three-story wooden structure that sat center stage. The structure transformed over Esperanza’s many stories into a bicycle, a crowded yellow Cadillac, the porch of a house and everything in between. That being said, the minimalist approach to the mise-en-scène provoked a thrilling motif of physicality from the cast. Franceli Chapman of the ensemble consistently stole the spotlight with her fluid, joyful dancing; in an early vignette she plays Marine, a seductive young girl who smokes cigarettes and dances as Esperanza watches. With her arms raised high and a cigarette between her fingers, Marine’s shadow grows into a consuming presence that captures the rebellious lining of innocence.
Perhaps most encapsulating of the divide between Mango Street and the rest of America was the story of a man who brings Marine, his pregnant wife, to the country. Esperanza and other neighbors speculate that the reason she doesn’t leave her house is because she’s afraid to speak English. Suddenly, Esperanza’s assumption becomes reality: Her husband yells at her, demanding that she learn English. As her son sings the jingle of an English Pepsi commercial, she wails, “Speak English.”
As the U.S. continues its battle with countless issues of race and immigration, The House on Mango Street reminds us what and who we are fighting for. In the play’s finale, a teary-eyed Esperanza declares that one day she will “say goodbye to Mango Street.” As the ensemble gathers around her, she says: “I’m too strong for her to keep me here forever.” 
What she means is, one day, she’ll find a life that is free of the various issues that color her life in the impoverished suburb. What she means is, we need to find a way to help.

I never thought I would get a tattoo until last Saturday. It wasn’t because I didn’t like them — I was just afraid of having something permanently marked on my body for the rest of my life. However, after seeing Lorde perform for the third time this year at Life is Beautiful, I knew it was time.
I spent some of my final hours that weekend as a walk-in customer at a tattoo parlor on the Las Vegas Strip. I was nervous and worried, but nevertheless I managed to assert a confident “yes” every time my friends asked me if I was sure about my decision. After watching a couple get matching tattoos at 1 a.m., I finally embraced the point of no return.
Surprisingly, watching the tattoo artist etch the words onto my skin with a needle was an invigorating feeling. I had never felt such euphoria before, and as exhausted as I was after being at a music festival all day, my heart continued to beat rapidly as each letter was written. An hour later, my wrist was officially inked with the words “green light.” I was liberated.
When I came back to campus on Monday, many people asked me what the tattoo meant. For brevity, I simply told them it was my favorite song of all time. And it was. But it also carried a much deeper meaning than I could ever casually explain in a two-minute conversation, so now here I am coming forward with the reason behind my choice. 
In retrospect, 2017 has been the most difficult year of my life — and even now, I’m still in the process of recovering from everything that’s happened. In March, I was confronted by both the death of a high school friend and a forced revelation of my sexuality to my family. As these events unraveled, I had also been threatened with the termination of my resident assistant contract.
My mental health took a hit and I fell into a deep state of depression as the semester went on. I wasn’t on speaking terms with my parents for at least a month; I withdrew from a class because I couldn’t handle the course load; I missed half of my internship to stay in bed; and I used drugs to escape the reality I was forced to face everyday. On the outside, I seemed fine to my residents, classmates and colleagues. But deep down, I was living a personal hell, not knowing where to go or who to ask for help.
By pure serendipity, Lorde released “Green Light” as this stage of my life took its course. When the song first came out, I listened to it because I loved the production — the octave leaps, the instrumental rush, the piano notes, the incongruity and complexity, everything. It was different from what Lorde had created since Pure Heroine, and I saw it as an indication of a new, unique direction she was headed in. But as I found myself listening to the song every day, I discovered many more reasons to love it as much as I do now. 
Allen Pham | Daily Trojan
“Green Light” became my personal anthem for empowerment. 
The brief moments of happiness that I truly enjoyed during this time were listening to the song on late-night car rides by myself. Every time Lorde chanted, “I’m waiting for it, that green light, I want it,” I chanted with her. No one to judge me for screaming to the top of my lungs, nothing else to think about. No interruptions. Just the melody blaring from the pulled-down windows of my red Toyota RAV4, and the reminder to keep moving forward.
Lorde even said it herself in an interview with Beats 1: “The song is really about those moments kind of immediately after your life changes and about all the silly little things that you gravitate toward … And I realized this is that drunk girl at the party dancing around crying about her ex-boyfriend who everyone thinks is a mess. That’s her tonight and tomorrow she starts to rebuild. And that’s the song for me.”
It’s strange how music can play such a big role in people’s lives. For me, “Green Light” was much more than just a breakup hit or a lead single. It was a reminder to keep pushing for the change I wanted to see in myself and in my life. 
I was tired of being sad. Of feeling lonely. Of worrying about what people thought of me. Of trying to fix every problem alone in the dark. Listening to “Green Light,” I realized I had to want that change — to fight for it, to angry dance for it — to do whatever it takes to make myself stronger and better, while also understanding that it’s OK to be upset at the things that brought me down.
When I look at my wrist now, I see the words “green light” permanently etched onto my skin. But in my mind, I’m reminded of my own strength, my resilience — as well as my love for Lorde. I now know I’m going to make it through life, and I’m prepared to overcome any struggle, heartbreak or pain that comes my way. I’ll continue to fight for my own happiness no matter what. All it takes is a simple song.
Thank you, Lorde, for allowing me to find myself. And also: Melodrama forever.

In a night of dancing and fans bumping to every single beat, Mura Masa impressed L.A. fans yet again Friday with an absolutely brilliant performance. Headlining the show at The Wiltern with opener Joey Purp, Alex Crossan, better known as Mura Masa, knew exactly how to put on a night of entertainment. 
The sold-out show is just the beginning of his 15-date U.S. tour, which will be followed by many more dates in Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Japan. Though the British-born musician has been making electro pop music since 2014, his career has skyrocketed since the release of the track “Lotus Eater” in 2014 and “Love$ick” in 2015. Since the release of his self-titled album in July of this year, Mura Masa has been met with positive responses from both avid fans and new listeners. Crossan has been touring a large amount of the year and just finished up playing several festivals including Lollapalooza, FYF Fest, Outside Lands and Life Is Beautiful last week in Las Vegas. 
Because the album features guest artists such as A$AP Rocky, Charli XCX, Bonzai and Desiigner, fans were expecting a surprise guest to come out at some point. During opener Joey Purp’s set, rapper Aminé came out to perform his top hit “Caroline,” setting the expectations for who could come out during Mura Masa’s set, and the crowd was not disappointed. Both Bonzai and Fliss performed for much of the show with Mura Masa as well as Jamie Lidell and Nao, who each made an appearance to perform one song.
The British artist has background in many genres besides electropop including punk, hardcore, gospel and trap, all of which have influenced his current style. Many fans were surprised to see Crossan surrounded by a full band setup rather than a simple synth pad.  Keyboards and drums, both standard percussive instruments and electronic pads, surrounded him as well as the occasional electric guitar. Mura Masa wowed the audience as he played all of the instruments throughout the whole night as well as provided occasional vocals. 
Within several opening beats to “Messy Love,” the crowd’s energy went through the roof and stayed there the whole night. The combination of the abstract visuals and over-the-top dancing from singer Fliss had the audience enraptured the entire performance. There wasn’t a dull moment; throughout the night, fans danced like there was no tomorrow. Bonzai and Fliss each came out for multiple songs including “Messy Love,” “helpline,” “Nuggets” and “Love$ick.” Making his stage debut in Los Angeles, Jamie Lidell sang his heart out during “NOTHING ELSE!” and won everybody’s heart with his soulful voice. 
Mura Masa shifted the mood temporarily with his slow and sweet performance of “Blu” using only a few electronic instruments and his electric guitar. The venue was lit with phone flashlights as the audience swayed to the rhythm. Afterwards, the mood shifted and the audience went crazy for hit “Love$ick.” Mura Masa and his guests went away for a few minutes, returning for the encore. The set ended with the popular “Firefly,” featuring British singer Nao. 
Given Mura Masa’s ability to fill an entire set with high-energy songs and beats that force you to move, the show was one to remember.  His aesthetic, from his unique outfit choices to extremely abstract visuals, makes one feel like they are at an abstract art gallery. His creativity and talent with both traditional and electronic instruments sets Mura Masa apart from all other electropop artists and puts him in a genre of his own. After a performance as legendary as this, it will be no surprise to see Mura Masa’s fan base grow even larger and more ardent.

Since its latest edition, the Google Translate application now supports over 100 languages and serves a worldwide community of over 500 million users virtually. But over 6,000 languages are actually spoken, with around 360 languages spoken by a million people or more.
To combat this disparity in translation technology, the USC Information Sciences Institute is working on a universal language translation system. Supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the program involves ISI Director of Natural Language Technologies Kevin Knight and a small team of full-time researchers and doctoral students.
Knight has worked with ISI in natural language processing for 25 years, and the system is one of many projects he’s working on in the field.
“That’s our goal — a universal language processor that works for any language,” Knight said. “We have a machine translation system [that] learns from examples to translate between languages. But we have a lot of data, for example, of all the human translations from the United Nations between English and French [to] train a system very well.”
However, the potential roadblock for the processor comes from languages less commonly spoken and limited existing data.
“If you don’t have a lot of data, which is the case for most languages, you have to be more creative,” Knight said.
Knight described an African language called Oromo that the team is currently working on. Oromo has a very free spelling convention, which makes it easier for humans to learn but difficult for a machine to connect two different spellings with one word.
“Just like you can spell the word ‘gray’ in English as ‘g-r-a-y’ or ‘g-r-e-y’, in [Oromo], almost any word can be spelled in almost any way,” Knight said. “That’s great for a person — a person doesn’t care — but when a computer reads it, it’s like, ‘Oh that word’s different from that word; I don’t know how to deal with it.’ So, you kind of have to be robust.”
Nima Pourdamghani, a doctoral student studying computer science, is a research assistant at ISI who explained the complications of creating a universal tool. Pourdamghani explained how languages each hold an extensive amount of vocabulary, but the team is developing ways to make the translation easier for them.
“Suppose we want to translate some language, but we have a related language from some nearby country,” Pourdamghani said. “We try to convert resources from that language into this language and get help from them.”
Pourdamghani says the machine can recognize Arabic and Latin as similar languages and can use data from one for the other.
“We were trying to have the machine both extract and clean dictionaries for all languages across the world,” Pourdamghani said.
The system, however, is still not well-equipped to deal with prefixes or suffixes, as well as the plural form of words. For example, the word “cat” and “cats” do not relate because the system is based on training data, Pourdamghani said. And when the machine reaches a word query there is no data for, it can’t continue.
The team plans to work on the system, smoothing out its kinks. According to Knight, a few upcoming additions to the machine include helping it recognize different categories of words like diseases, holidays or personal titles.
The machine, once completed, will help international efforts like disaster relief, Knight said. When aid comes to countries that speak different languages, rescuers need to be able to communicate in various dialects to exchange information.
The translation project is a collaboration with other teams across the nation through DARPA, an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. While USC focuses on the translation aspect of the project, other universities specialize in identifying the words that are people, places and organizations from any language, Knight said. Every year there is a common evaluation to share each group’s innovations.
“It’s a big project that different teams in the country, even across the world, are collaborating on, and we’re sharing tools and sharing ideas together,” Pourdamghani said. “Hopefully in the next few years, we can have a better translation system for other languages.”

Like their peers in the Los Angeles Police Department, USC’s Department of Public Safety officers are armed with a handgun, meant for use in severe situations.
Unlike LAPD though, DPS is currently not armed with tasers.
Campus police is considering providing its officers with these less-lethal weapons, amid a nationwide discussion over police use of force on college campuses, according to DPS.
Last month, the president of the LGBT club at Georgia Tech died in the hands of police while they went through a mental breakdown, according to the victim’s family’s lawyer.
Scout Schultz, a senior majoring in engineering and the president of Georgia Tech’s Pride Alliance, was killed by a school police officer on Sept. 17, after the campus police department received a 9-1-1 call that Schultz, who was gender non-binary, was carrying a gun near a parking garage on campus, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.
Video footage of Schultz’s death showed that they were holding a multi-purpose tool in their hand and were walking toward officers yelling, “Shoot me, Shoot me!” Officers retreated and called for backup. One of the five officers shot at Schultz, killing him.
On the Georgia Tech campus, police officers only had one tool for defense: a gun.
At USC, DPS is working to make sure that using lethal force is not the only option.
“We are currently evaluating the use of tasers for our officers,” said DPS Assistant Chief David Carlisle. “It’s a less lethal form of disabling a person. I would suspect that in the future, we will be carrying tasers so that if our officers are placed in that [kind of] situation, there is an alternative to deadly force.”
Shanéa Thomas, a senior lecturer at the USC Dworak-Peck School of Social Work who has worked with LGBTQ youth, said that the most important step toward avoiding situations like the one with Schultz is providing officers with training to avoid the use of lethal force.
“The ways we react to distress isn’t necessarily to shoot somebody,” Thomas said. “The answer is to find out what is going on … I believe we can do all that without weapons.”
For students, seeing officers with guns on campus can be alarming, but also reassuring. Nicole Spence, a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering, grew up in South Africa, where neither citizens nor police officers are allowed to carry guns.
Though Spence disproves of guns as a whole, she said she understands why officers would have them, as citizens are allowed to cary guns in the United States.
“The ideal situation would be to shoot at their leg,” Spence said. “There needs to be a policy to only incapacitate and not kill.”
She said she feels safer knowing that DPS officers are armed in case someone “with malicious intent” also has a weapon on campus.
Currently, DPS officers are categorized either as community service officers or public safety officers.
CSOs do not carry guns or batons, but are allowed to carry Mace defense spray. PSOs are fully armed and train alongside other officers in the LAPD Academy, Carlisle said.
In the six-month academy, PSOs work alongside LAPD trainees and are trained to deal with people experiencing mental health crises.
“The goal of the Department is to provide a humane, cooperative, compassionate and effective law enforcement response to persons within our community who are afflicted with mental illness and disorders,” LAPD said in a press release last year. “The Department believes that this training is cutting edge and provides our personnel with increased skills to serve our communities.”
Along with attending these workshops, DPS officers must commit to consistent evaluations on their effective use of weapons and are trained for different types of scenarios, whether it be facing a person with a weapon or pulling somebody over for a traffic violation.
“We track every officer’s training to make sure that they meet this training standard — a minimum of 24 hours of continuous professional training,” Carlisle said. “There is no shortage of training.”
Specifically considering the situation in Georgia Tech, Carlisle said that every situation is different, but with a call like the one at the East Coast campus, DPS would have probably asked LAPD for help.
“It would be important to learn from that scenario or any other officer-involved shooting … what was in the officer’s mind when they pulled the trigger?” Carlisle said. “We will do whatever we could to avoid the use of deadly force.”

After both Hurricanes Irma and Maria hit Puerto Rico in September, the U.S. territory has been in dire need of aid. The Puerto Rican community at USC is doing its part to support the island by setting up efforts to raise awareness, mobilize politicians, donate money and send supplies to Puerto Rico, both on campus and in the greater Los Angeles area.
“I didn’t want to sit idly on the side,” said Victor Cruz, a Puerto Rican graduate student.
Cruz is part of the communications committee for Los Angeles for Puerto Rico, a grassroots organization formed just after Hurricane Maria hit the island. The group is primarily aiming to promote three fundraisers to send monetary aid to Puerto Rico, Cruz said.
“Mariafund.org is the one we want people to most directly donate to do, because that money is being directly given to people in Puerto Rico — there’s no intermediary force,” Cruz said. “That money is directly distributed to nonprofit organizations that are working most closely with the hardest-hit areas of the island.”
The other two fundraisers are Voices for Puerto Rico, an effort organized by Puerto Rican cultural influencers in the mainland United States and a YouCaring page set up by Los Angeles for Puerto Rico. The money from both of these efforts will go to local nonprofits in Puerto Rico, Cruz said.
Another fund not specifically associated with Los Angeles for Puerto Rico is Students with Puerto Rico, a GoFundMe campaign organized by several University of Pennsylvania students at the University of Pennsylvania, which has now spread to over 100 universities across the United States, including USC.
Limari Archuleta, a senior studying health promotion and disease prevention, is the USC representative for Students with Puerto Rico.
“As Puerto Rican students on the mainland, watching all of these horrible pictures and videos, all these horrible things happening back home, we felt useless, so we wanted to do something from over here,” Archuleta said. “The money that will be fundraised there will be donated to the [Puerto Rican] First Lady’s United for Puerto Rico campaign.”
As of Friday, the campaign raised over $142,000 in nine days, with a goal of $150,000.
USC students are also organizing efforts to collect supplies to be shipped to Puerto Rico.
“We’re asking for basically anything — batteries, canned food, diapers, anything you can think of,” said Archuleta, who is organizing a “USC for Puerto Rico” campaign as a subsidiary of the larger Los Angeles group. “Puerto Rico is in huge need. A lot of people lost everything.”
Currently, drop-off locations for supplies will be open at El Centro Chicano on the fourth floor of the Student Union, and at the Smiles Cafe adjacent to the Caruso Catholic Center. Archuleta is also working with other student groups and departments at USC to open more drop-off locations soon.
“I would love to have the support of big departments of USC,” Archuleta said. “I would really love for President [C.L. Max Nikias] to support us in the same way he released a statement about Mexico [after it was hit by an earthquake].”
Raising awareness about the disaster is also a major part of aiding Puerto Rico.The New York Times reported that 46 percent of Americans don’t know that Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens, and those are Americans are nearly half as likely to support aid efforts for Puerto Rico as those who recognize the territory as part of the United States.
Similarly, media coverage of Hurricane Maria and its effects on Puerto Rico has been relatively low, especially when compared to media coverage of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, both of which hit mainland states. At its peak, coverage of Texas and Florida, where Harvey and Irma respectively made landfall, was three to four times higher than coverage of Puerto Rico at its peak, according to data journalism sight FiveThirtyEight.
“What we’re doing is not simply raising funds — we also want to raise awareness of the Puerto Rican situation,” said Assistant Spanish Professor Ronald Mendoza-De Jesus, who is also working as a part of Los Angeles for Puerto Rico.
Cruz also said that because Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, there are a number of restrictions that make it harder for Puerto Rico to rebound from natural disaster.
Since the hurricane, President Donald Trump has temporarily waived the Jones Act for a 10-day period. The act is a shipping law that requires all goods shipped between points in the land owned by the United States to be sent through vessels owned, operated and built by Americans, making it more expensive to get supplies to Puerto Rico.
Although waiving the law allows aid in the short term, the law has been severely detrimental to the Puerto Rican economy throughout its history because it makes trade and taxation on the island much more expensive, according to The New York Times.
As of May 2017, the Times reported that the territory is $123 billion dollars in debt.
“That’s one of the things we’re asking Congress for, to abolish the debt that Puerto Rico has on the island, because hedge funds own the Puerto Rican debt, so it’s not possible for Puerto Rico to restructure its debt in the way other states would,” Cruz said. “It’s really crippling the efforts to rebuild there. That debt itself is going to be affecting the long term reconstruction of the Puerto Rican nation. We’re looking to have the United States, if not forgive the debt entirely, allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt in the same way it would allow states to restructure their debt.”
Cruz and Los Angeles for Puerto Rico are contacting politicians at the local, state and federal levels to mobilize political support for Puerto Rico, so the island will be able to deal with a natural disaster atop an already dire economic situation.
For Archuleta, Cruz and Mendoza De-Jesus, supporting Puerto Rico is important because of their deep personal connections to the island.
“Puerto Ricans are very gregarious, and fiercely linked to the island,” Mendoza-De Jesus said. “Even the ones who have been gone for a long time … want to maintain as close ties as possible to it.”
