New boss · Brent Crouch, USC women’s volleyball’s new head coach, has had an outstanding coaching career, most notably at the University of Portland. (Sam Arslanian | Daily Trojan)
Daily Trojan: Your wife is from Palos Verdes, Calif. Did this job motivate you move to there?
Brent Crouch: Definitely. I wanted to find a job as I moved up the coaching ranks that would allow me to compete for a national championship. So check the box here at USC. And the other big consideration was being around family. We’ve got two little kids. A one-year-old and a two-year-old. Boys. And my wife grew up here and her parents are still here in Palos Verdes. And being able to come to work here every day with this program and see them, the grandparents in the evening with the kids is awesome.
DT: You had a couple of great years at Portland. What made the job at USC appealing to you?
Crouch: I always have wanted to coach and teach at the highest level possible. And as you know one of the five characteristics of being a Trojan is ambition, and I share that, and this feels like home in the sense that that’s just everybody’s goal is trying to win the whole thing. That’s always what I wanted to do, so that made it in addition to the family, it made it number one for me.
DT: Perhaps one of your most notable accomplishments is how you revived a struggling Portland program to its winningest season in 25 years. Obviously this group of girls is a little different in the sense that they are a winning team, but what areas of improvement do you see for this team?
Crouch: I think the game is moving at a different speed now; things are just getting faster and faster and faster. So you got to have some systems in place that allow you to play at that speed. At Portland, there was a lot more fundamental work that had to be put into place. And the fundamentals here, everybody needs to get better at it always. At every single level, you never stop teaching the fundamentals of passing and serving and so on. Those are the building blocks, but there was already a pretty solid base here already of that, at the level among the athletes in terms of what they can do physically.
DT: In an article from USC Athletics, your former colleague at St. Mary’s, Rob Browning, talked about how much of your success is derived from your academic background. How does that background play into your role as a coach?
Crouch: “I’m a John Wooden fan […] and he talked a lot about being a teacher. And [that] people who wanted to be coaches should go get a teaching background first and I’m of the same mindset. Coming from a family of teachers, teaching has always been a priority for me. So I think it just dovetails nicely for me.
DT: To what extent and in what way does your experience as a player affect the way you coach your teams?
Crouch: I think it’s not absolutely necessary to play to be a good coach. […] but I think if you’re able to play at a high level for a long period of time, and I played at a medium high level, higher on the beach, you’ve got a sense for maybe some of the nuances and fundamentals and things that are helpful. But the  bigger piece, though, is that you’ve been in the environment, so it may be a little bit easier to connect with student-athletes cause you’ve been there before.
DT: What is your reaction to replacing Mick Haley? (the former head coach who was let go after serving 17 years with the Trojans)
Crouch: Oh, gosh. I hope at the end of my career I can say I’m even half as successful as he was. The guy was, and is, just a phenomenal coach. These are really, really big shoes to step into and it’s an honor to be a part of the tradition here and be selected to be the next coach. I’m also confident in what I do and I think it’ll be a little different, but I’m excited to get started.
DT: What should fans look forward to seeing this year?
Crouch: The game is going to look a little bit different in terms of systematic stuff. The offense is going to be fast and it will be fast in more situations than it has been in the past, so that will be fun. We’ve got a really new team, we’ve graduated four starters from last year. That’s a big number. And we’ve brought in six new players this year, four freshmen and two transfers, and three of them are going to get significant playing time right away. So it’s going to look quite different in terms of the faces out there and the style of volleyball. But we are bringing back two of the big guns, Khalia [Lanier] and Brook [Botkin]. So I think in those two positions in particular it’s going to be really fun to watch them.

The new policy is being piloted at USC’s three most heavily visited libraries: Doheny, Leavey and VKC libraries. Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries, plans to expand the policy to other campus libraries. (Ankit Mukherjee | Daily Trojan)
Beginning Sept. 4, everyone entering Doheny, Leavey and VKC libraries will be required to show a valid ID.
This change comes after two years of a close review of the security practices of libraries across USC campuses, according to Catherine Quinlan, the dean of USC libraries. 
The review followed security concerns at college libraries nationwide, which prompted Quinlan to look more closely at library security policies. 
Currently, Leavey Library policy requires students to present their USCards to gain access to the library after 9 p.m. According to Quinlan, students who forgot their IDs were becoming “quite aggressive.”
“It was increasingly concerning to me that I was putting our student [workers] at risk by not providing more professional security support for them,” Quinlan said. “So that really caused the change this year.”
With the change, USC students, faculty and staff must scan a valid USCard before entering any of the three libraries, similar to the current process required to enter Leavey Library after 9 p.m. 
The libraries will still be open to public access. Those not affiliated with USC will be required to present a valid government photo ID or an ID from another school or university, which will grant them access to the libraries until 9 p.m. 
People without a USCard or other accepted forms of identification will be required to request a temporary library pass at Doheny Library at the time of their visit.
The review, which examined peer institutions’ library security policies, was conducted in conjunction with the USC Department of Public Safety and the Provost’s Office. Hugh Thomas McHarg, the associate dean of strategic initiatives in USC libraries, also worked closely on developing the new identification policy.
“Our libraries are large and busy places,” McHarg said in an email to the Daily Trojan. “It’s our responsibility to maintain a welcoming environment that is also secure and productive for everyone who uses the libraries.” 
McHarg believes this new identification process will serve as a deterrent as well as help the University respond to security concerns. 
The new policy is being piloted at USC’s three most heavily visited libraries, but Quinlan plans to expand a similar requirement to the rest of USC’s more than 20 libraries. She welcomes student feedback to aid in improving the policy throughout the semester. 
“Our intention really was … to make this a safe and secure environment in which our students and all of our users can be productive,” Quinlan said, “not to be obstructionist.”

USC physics professor Clifford Johnson spoke about the complexity of time at the first event of the Polymathic Pizza series Wednesday. Other speakers included theoretical physicist and professor Sean Caroll and provost professor of art history and English Kate Flint. (Aamani Ponnekanti | Daily Trojan)
On Wednesday, the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Studies kicked off its first panel of Polymathic Pizza, a series of open discussions on topics covering various academic disciplines. The panel event, aptly titled “The Arrow of Time,” featured theoretical physicist and California Institute of Technology research professor Sean Carroll, USC physics and astronomy professor Clifford Johnson and USC provost professor of art history and English Kate Flint.
This semester’s Polymathic Pizza series focuses on all aspects of the concept of time.
“When we were going . . . through all of the troubles as a University and also some of the student deaths that happened this past year, [I] started thinking about how I wish they had more time and [the idea] that time heals,” said Karin Huebner, a senior administrator at the Academy.
At the event, panelists were asked to speak about time as a “multivalent framework for life.” Each speaker drew ideas and contributed expert opinion from their academic backgrounds in their talks on the topic. 
Johnson, the first speaker on the panel, focused his presentation on the malleability of time. To illustrate this concept, he presented an image from the 2014 film “Interstellar.” He later explained that the plot point in which 22 years pass in the couple of hours that characters enter a black hole is a scientifically true phenomenon, contrary to popular belief. 
“Space and time are all packaged in an exotic way,” Johnson said. “The way to think about objects moving is that matter warps and bends space time in some way.”
While Johnson’s approach to understanding the complexities of time focused more on the relativity aspect of the subject, Carroll focused his contributions to the panel on physicist Stephen Hawking’s idea of the arrow of time, the titular topic of the discussion.
Carroll’s area of expertise and research focuses on how people can distinguish between the past and future.
“Space happening over and over again is the passage of time,” Johnson said. 
He continued to explain that the idea of entropy is related to our understanding of time in the universe and stated, “as the arrow of time [continues], entropy increases from left to right.”
While both Carroll and Johnson were able to draw from their STEM backgrounds to discuss the idea of time, Flint offered a more literary and art-based area of expertise. Her experience as a novelist and photographer allowed her to look at time through a different lens.
Drawing from her recent book, “Flash! Photography, Writing, and Surprising Illumination,” Flint explored the question of what flash photography is and how its answer is relative and dependent on technology and its context. Her presentation reviewed the history and evolution of photography and, specifically, flash photography. According to Flint, there is a light created by the flash eruption and that in the moment, “time is artificially stopped so we can look at moving objects.” 
Tying her presentation to that of the other presenters, Flint described flash photography as a  new way to see beauty and . 
“One of the gifts that the humanities gives us is the thought of the flexibility of time … without having to come up with any mathematical explanation or rationale of how the world works,” Flint said.
Her perspective introduced concepts, such as art history, which would otherwise not have been discussed if the panel was solely composed of STEM field experts.
Carroll, Johnson and Flint ended the forum with an open discussion of questions from Polymathic Institute director Tara McPherson, and the students and faculty in the audience. 
“I just wanted students and the campus to understand that time is our friend — time heals,” Huebner said. “There is no division we are all going through time together.”

Tracey Aivaz, a senior majoring in production at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, found out she would be directing a short film as part of Walmart’s Academy Awards film series “The Box.” (Photo courtesy of Tracey Aivaz)
Filmmaker Tracey Aivaz has already stepped foot onto her path toward being a young, female filmmaker in Hollywood. Aivaz, a senior majoring in production at USC School of Cinematic Arts, was chosen by Walmart to direct their 60-second Oscar short film “The Box” after interning for the Academy Gold Program last year.
Walmart is the Academy Awards’ largest sponsor, and this year, they held three 60-second commercials which aired during the telecast of the Oscars. The commercials were directed by Nancy Meyers, Melissa McCarthy and Dee Rees. Aivaz was chosen as the fourth director — she wrote and directed her own commercial piece, which was premiered at the Bentonville Film Festival in Arkansas this past May. 
“What was really fascinating about the commercial was the experience I got with working with professionals,” Aivaz said. “It was a unique collaboration between professionals who are working on features in TV, and students who are at USC. I got to bring in my Gold people and USC people into the thing as well.” 
“The Box” follows a young girl who looks to her mother for support in accomplishing her goal to horseback ride.
Aivaz attributes her love of film to her childhood, where she grew up watching and discussing movies with her parents. Her film career began when she was 12 years old and elected to create a short film for a science class. 
“I had a natural sense of story and appreciation of story ever since I was a kid,” Aivaz said. “That’s why I volunteered to make a movie for a science project that everyone did on paper.” 
Aivaz continued making short films throughout high school until she was eventually accepted to SCA. She applied for as many as 80 internships and was rejected from all of them; Aivaz described those rejections as “the nature of business.” However, those rejections did not deter her — she was soon accepted as an intern for an Academy Gold Program in summer 2017, a dream offer for an aspiring filmmaker. 
“[Rejection] kind of shatters you, but also matures you,” Aivaz said. “I think limitations really add to creativity. The more limitations you have, you’re going to find out different ways to get to what you want.” 
For three months, Aivaz interned at Panavision’s Iron Office. She attended weekly events at the Academy, where she sat in the same conference as directors Kathryn Bigelow and Sofia Coppola and asked them questions. In addition, the program offered some member screenings, including Steven Spielberg’s “The Post.”
“Spielberg was 10 feet away from me and I got to say hi,” Aivaz said. “I just got to hear him in person talk about the movie, and it was really inspiring. Just lovely environment, and the directors at the Academy do everything they can to open up opportunities for Gold interns.”
Aivaz also described her experience walking the Red Carpet at the 2018 Oscars during her Academy Gold internship as “surreal.” One of the moments that resonated with her was a conversation with actress Sandra Bullock, who Aivaz said is an ideal representation of a Hollywood role model. 
“The most incredible, awesome, crazy experience I’ve ever had, really. You were in the same theater as all these crazy celebrities and filmmakers you’ve seen on the screen your whole life,” Aivaz said. “It was just really inspiring to see that many talented people.” 
Aivaz believes that her education at USC has been crucial to her success. According to Aivaz, SCA immerses students in every aspect of filmmaking and offers a comprehensive education and filmmaking, from pre-production to post-production. 
“For me, it gave me experience in every field, and it really proved me that I wanted to direct, I wanted to be involved from the beginning to the end,” Aivaz said. “It really gave me hands-on experience, knowledge about the industry, and it helped me land the Academy internship. If it wasn’t because of SCA, I really don’t think I would’ve had anything related to the Academy or Walmart.”
In the process of making film, Aivaz likes to emphasize two key aspects: to entertain and to send out messages. 
“Any movie I make, I want to have those two aspects,” Aivaz said. “I don’t want it to be pure entertainment, and I don’t want it to be purely a message or a moral story. I want it to have both.”
She said the film industry is becoming increasingly more open to inclusion and diversity and she feels proud to be part of a revolutionary era in Hollywood. 
“It’s just starting so the numbers aren’t up there, but I’m seeing a lot of movement in different platforms. I feel like it’s going to keep on getting better and better,” Aivaz said. “I just feel really lucky to enter Hollywood in this era where women are respected and diverse filmmakers are respected. I feel fortunate.”
However, Aivaz is still not satisfied — her dream is to one day direct television features and own her own production company with a studio back-up.

Patricia Clarkson and Amy Adams play mother-daughter duo Adora and Camille Preaker, respectively, in HBO’s limited series “Sharp Objects.” The series finale will air on Sunday. (Photo courtesy of HBO)
The season finale of “Sharp Objects” airs on Sunday, marking the end of HBO’s eight-episode limited series. However, writers Gillian Flynn and Marti Noxon have done an excellent job of maintaining an element of mystery as the series reaches its end. Noxon’s penchant for cryptic storytelling, paired with director Jean-Marc Vallée’s wandering gaze and jarring camera movements, makes the series cinematically thrilling. 
Much like “Big Little Lies,” “Sharp Objects” is based on Flynn’s novel of the same name. It is the second series that Vallée has directed for HBO, his first being the Emmy Award-winning limited series “Big Little Lies.” 
Starring Amy Adams as alcoholic crime reporter Camille Preaker and Patricia Clarkson as her overbearing mother, Adora, “Sharp Objects” explores an intense mother-daughter dynamic in the context of a murder mystery in the rural town of Wind Gap, Mo.
Vallée’s show generally moves more slowly than Flynn’s novel. However, when one considers how Vallée typically plays with time, it would be safe to say that the slower pace only adds to the gritty realism of the series as a whole. The suspense that builds between scenes and the tension between characters is emphasized by the stark silences that accompany  each character’s (more often than not, Camille’s) introspection. The viewer’s sense of time is warped by the intermittent flashbacks to Camille’s past, blurring the past and the present.
The audience is first introduced to the town of Wind Gap through the eyes of Camille, and learns about her troubled childhood through flashbacks in the pilot. 
From Preaker’s perspective, it is immediately evident that Wind Gap is a small, southern town, slow in every way except for the speed at which rumors travel. In this sense, the dreariness of the town parallels the suspenseful and glacial pace at which events unfold. However, the descent into madness, the hallucinations of her long-dead sister Marian in various episodes like “Dirt” and “Cherry,”  is followed closely by the sudden increased pace of the story. Furthermore, it would be a mistake for viewers to think just because each episode is moving painstakingly slow that the details presented are any less important. 
The added scenes that do not appear in the novel bring more context to character interactions. It is never clear to viewers why Camille would entertain her half-sister Amma’s ridiculousness in Episode 6, “Cherry,” after the death of both her beloved sister, Marian, and her psychiatric hospital roommate, Sydney Sweeney — who was not originally in the novel. Furthermore, the camera’s focus on the smallest of details provides hints to the audience as to who exactly the killer is. Vallée lingers on the smallest of movements like the raising of an eyebrow so that every scene is rich with clues as to who the killer is. 
While there is an underlying suggestion that the killer is male, it is unambiguous that this story is about, and dictated by, the women in Wind Gap. Adams delivers a stunning performance as Camille, a character much more demanding than her previous roles. There is a rough edge to Camille that comes not from drugs or alcohol, but from the mere fact that an innocent girl, who could have grown up to be a wholesome adult, became tainted by the demons in her past. Camille’s tortured psyche is visible not only through the scars littered across her body, but also in Adam’s stellar portrayal of a tired and worn-out soul — her large, doe eyes become windows into the ongoing trauma of Camille’s past. 
Camille’s relationship with Adora amd Amma, as well as the other women in town, reveal a stressed and tense relationship that is handled delicately in true Southern fashion. While the sheriff and other townspeople insist on mens’ tendencies for violence,  both the novel and show demonstrate that women, too, can be malicious. Eliza Scanlen, who plays Amma, and Clarkson (Adora) juxtapose Adams’ Camille perfectly. Scanlen’s portrayal of Amma as both sweet, yet callous, docile yet domineering, makes her a three-dimensional and interesting character. Meanwhile, Clarkson’s becomes the perfect image of the stern and strict mother through Adora — an anti-hero the audience loves to hate. 
Similar to “Big Little Lies,” “Sharp Objects” gives its complicated female characters center stage, allowing their darkness and messiness breathing room. No matter who the killer is revealed to be in the series finale, the true core of “Sharp Objects” is the many secrets and traumas that shape human life itself.

Downtown Los Angeles offers a variety of coffee shops perfect for studying, catching up with friends or grabbing a cup of joe on the go. Here’s a small sampling of the hottest spots for your next trip downtown.

LOIT Cafe
301 W. Olympic Blvd., Ste. CDE
Los Angeles, CA 90015
Hours:
Mon-Sat: 8 a.m. — 7 p.m.
Sun: 9 a.m. — 7 p.m.
The grind: LOIT serves up Counter Culture coffee, a brand based in North Carolina focused on quality and sustainability. In addition to coffee, it also serves teas, quiches, toasts and sandwiches.  
The cream: One of LOIT’s stand-out features is its Black line — a charcoal-colored collection of drinks that match the store’s color scheme. The interior is minimal in color but ample in class. Along one wall is the coffee bar, which is perpendicular to wide, black-marbled tables with outlets. By the floor-to-ceiling windows on the other end are a few smaller tables, where Gatsby-esque black chairs gather in an arrangement perfect for conversation. The shop’s playlists vary greatly; some Saturdays feature nothing but The Smiths, while others are chock-full of baroque classical or today’s top EDM tracks.

The roast: LOIT is adjacent to a clothing store of the same name, with a collection of many popular brands such as Comme des Garcons, Acne Studios and A.P.C. 
Public transportation: Hop onto Downtown Dash Line F, which circles USC’s campus and drops riders off in the heart of downtown. Get off at the Figueroa & Olympic stop. It’s a 10 minute walk through the FIDM campus’ public park space.
 
Blue Bottle Coffee
300 S. Broadway
Los Angeles, CA 90013
Hours: 
Mon-Fri: 6:30 a.m. — 6 p.m.
Sat-Sun: 7 a.m. — 7 p.m.
The grind: Located across the street from Grand Central Market, Blue Bottle Coffee is a Bay Area staple that has found its way to Southern California, as well as the East Coast and Japan. Its beans are roasted by hand.
The cream: This particular location has an entrance that will take customers through the famed Bradbury building, recognizable for its appearance in movies  like “Blade Runner” and “(500) Days of Summer.” Inside, the space is bright and open, with high ceilings and recessed lights that contribute to a calm ambience.
The roast: Because of the nature of chain coffee stops, the way the coffee is prepared will vary from location to location. Downtown Los Angeles’ Blue Bottle is popular because of its location near Grand Central Market. On some days, it may be difficult to snag a seat, but the cafe compensates with long communal tables paired with white wooden-legged chairs.
Public transportation:Metro Line 81 will take riders from the street corner across the Galen Center (Figueroa Street and Jefferson Boulevard) to Hill and 4th streets just around the corner.
 
Verve Coffee Roasters
833 S. Spring St.
Los Angeles, CA 90014
Hours: 
Daily: 7 a.m. — 7 p.m.
The grind: Grown and roasted in the Santa Cruz mountains, Verve Coffee Roasters brings some Northern California greenery to its location with an exterior living wall complemented by wooden sidewalk chairs and tables. It also sells branded mugs and other brewing equipment.
The cream: Verve’s ambiance differs from many other downtown coffee shops because its theme is reminiscent of the outdoors. Every surface is wood, and long, hanging bare bulbs provide lighting similar to the warmth of natural light. 
The roast: Verve is very popular, and while there is plenty of seating, it can be hard to find outlets for a long study session. The outside seating is taken up quickly, and it is not ideal for work — the tables are at an ergonomically awkward height for any purpose other than to set a cup of coffee on. 
Public transportation: The cafe is a few blocks southeast of LOIT Cafe and four blocks southwest from Blue Bottle Coffee, and can be accessed from either the Downtown Dash F or Metro Line 81.

Tilt Coffee Bar 
334 S. Main St., #1
Los Angeles, CA 90013
Hours: 
Mon-Sat: 7 a.m. — 7 p.m.
Sun: 9 a.m. — 6 p.m.
The grind: From streetside, Tilt Coffee Bar resembles a giant glass box, with a large metal flower suspended above the entrance like a net. Its founder has competed three times at the World Latte Art Championship, and it serves beans from Portland-based Heart Coffee Roasters.
The cream: Tilt has a sparse menu, but the prices fall on the cheaper side of Los Angeles coffee — an espresso costs $3 and a cafe latte $4.50. They are known for their Korean-influenced cloud mochas and lattes, which contain delicious dollops of cream floating atop a creamy espresso base.
The roast: Tilt is located in the middle of an apartment complex. It is slightly difficult to find, and is a deceivingly tiny space, until one ventures around back where there is more seating and an adjacent room with outlets and Wi-Fi. It can also be difficult to find street parking, though there are paid lots in the area.
Public transportation: Located in the northern part of Downtown, Tilt is a little more difficult to get to from USC’s campus. Dash Downtown F can get riders part of the way there, with a transfer to Metro Line 733 at Figueroa and Venice streets. Line 733 will drop riders off right in front of Tilt at Main and 4th streets.

The third season of Issa Rae’s HBO series “Insecure” premiered on Aug. 12. Rae visited USC last spring to speak to students about her black identity and the entertainment industry. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Season three of HBO’s “Insecure” picks up where season two left off: after splitting with ex-boyfriend Lawrence (Jay Ellis), Issa Dee (Issa Rae, star and creator) has no permanent place to stay and chooses to live in tension with her other ex, Daniel (Y’lan Noel). She is still stuck in a financial hole and resorts to becoming a part-time Lyft driver after being demoted from her full-time job. 
In short, Issa is struggling more than ever to find stability in her life in season three. The show is frustrating to watch whenever her character makes unavoidable bad decisions, almost never learning from her past. And it is also painful to watch Issa and her friends continuously fall into incredibly unpleasant, yet relatable situations. But this stark comic realism is precisely why “Insecure” is one of the most well-written shows on television today. 
Rae, who is currently nominated for an Emmy for her performance of Dee, told NPR that “Insecure” is a show about “regular black people being basic.” The show prides itself for its normality and is skillful in its portrayal of life’s painfully awkward situations. 
Last season, Issa’s presence as the only black voice at “We Got Y’all,” a racially tone deaf organization that prides itself on helping minorities, was a punchline. “We Got Y’all” is problematic, and this season really delves into why that is. This season, her presence is a political statement. One of the most poignant examples of this during the new season happens in the first episode when Issa explains to her boss Joanne (Catherine Curtin) that the schools their organization, dubbed “We Got Y’all,” works with want out on their partnership due to their lack of diversity. In response, her boss dismisses Dee while her caucasian co-worker Frieda (Lisa Joyce) uncomfortably watches. Issa is humiliated, and her co-workers’ silence is deafening. The show does this best: it takes the situations that Issa finds herself in and magnifies them, evoking inevitable emotional responses from the audience.
A shining light comes at the end of the season’s second episode, where after applying for a new job, Issa gets a call back to schedule an interview, giving the audience a sense of relief after a hopeless first two episodes. It also gives Issa a chance to break free of “We Got Y’all.” 
As Issa’s life stagnates, her best friend Molly’s life is a stark contrast. Molly has left her nearly all-white-male law firm to work at a new black law firm, only to find herself still at the bottom of the company’s ladder. She doesn’t know how to exist in spaces where her “otherness” and “blackness” don’t make her the odd one out. Thus, she finds herself constantly disappointed with herself and in her life — both professionally and romantically — and decides to take charge of what doesn’t please her. She cuts ties with her on-and-off lover, and finds comfort in her friendship with Issa. Their differing situations ignite conversations surrounding race, class and money, an integral plot point of the newest season. 
Issa’s ex- boyfriend Lawrence is left out of this season — and for good reason. Without him, the show now explores Issa’s relationship dynamics with other characters as well as herself. Episode 2 finally begins to unpack her relationship with Daniel, with whom she cheated on Lawrence. Their characters are similar: They are both struggling in their careers and trying to find their place in the world. On a club outing, Issa spends her time supporting Daniel and pushing him toward advancing his career and his life goals, yet she rarely does the same for herself. This is both one of her biggest character flaws and also and most relatable. In the upcoming episodes, it would be refreshing to see Issa put Daniel down and distance herself from him until she can find stability in her own life, especially as his life is seemingly just as off-balanced as hers.
