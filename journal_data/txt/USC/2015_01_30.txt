The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences has created a new major: international relations and the global economy,  combining two of the school’s most popular majors, international relations and economics.
The new major will allow students to take courses involving both international relations theories with a more technical curriculum that includes global finance, statistics for economists, and micro- and macroeconomics.
According to USC News, students will acquire mathematical and analytical skills as well as a foundation in political theory pertaining to the global economy.
As many Dornsife students were already building double majors in related disciplines, the new major will allow them to explore both international relations and economic theories without having to take overlapping courses to fulfill separate major requirements.
The designer of the IRGE curriculum, assistant professor of international relations Ben Graham, explained the rationale behind the creation of this interdisciplinary major.
“The idea is that the domestic economy is affected by the global economy,” Graham said. “Students need to be aware of the global politics shaping the domestic economy and the political forces that affect markets.”
Graham also emphasized the need for students interested in global business to develop an understanding of how international economies operate.
“You’re always competing in a global economy,” Graham said. “So there’s a lot to be said for putting an international spin on studying the economy.”

The USC Career Center, in conjunction with Spark SC and the Marshall School of Business, hosted a panel discussion about startup companies in the Annenberg West lobby on Thursday evening. The event walked students through various facets of the entrepreneurial process, specifically discussing the nature of success and values.
Spark SC is a team of student innovators hosted by Career Fest, in part of the Explore@4 series, which connects students with top professionals and alumni in various career fields.
The discussion was moderated by Paul Orlando, a venture partner and adjunct professor at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies. The panel consisted of a variety of startups, including Originate, a software product strategist company, and Flipagram, a video-creating startup that uses photos from smartphones to create stories.
Calvin Legassick, a member of the Spark SC planning committee, discussed how the concept of startups is often misconstrued.
“I think for most students, the idea of startups is this nebulous concept that some people do when they start companies like Facebook, and that dropouts don’t really happen to anybody,” Legassick said, “But that’s not really the right picture.”
During the discussion, the panelists spoke about what it was like for them to work at a startup for the first few years.
Tasha Choi, founder and chief executive officer of Tackl, discussed why her role as CEO does not define a specific set of duties. Tackl is an online platform that hosts innovation competitions to encourage up-and-coming innovators to solve problems and make change happen.
“We joked that CEO is the chief everything officer,” Choi said. “I literally do everything from management to being my own driver. We only have five people, so we’re ready to do anything and everything.”
Scott Sebelius, director of engineering at Originate, revealed how he at first didn’t realize that he needed to be invested in every aspect of his startup. Sebelius explained how the secret to a successful startup is to be proactive and to seek out the right mentor to make impactful changes.
David Ginchansky, senior career counselor at the USC Career Center, referred to startups as a booming industry.
“Startups are really big right now, people either want to know how to get into small business, or they want to be the entrepreneurs themselves,” Ginchansky said. “So being able to bring panelists to campus who do that type of work to share their experiences and advice is what Explore@4 is all about.”
Curran Mahowald, a senior majoring in French and linguistics, thought that the panelists gave helpful advice to students hoping to become entrepreneurs in the future.
“I really liked the quote, ‘If you’re looking for funding, ask for advice. If you’re looking for advice, ask for funding,’” Mahowald said. “I also liked their advice to go to a hackathon or a startup weekend because I had not been aware that startup weekends existed, and I didn’t even know it was a good idea for me to go to either of those things.”
The panelists also emphasized that passion is the driving force in startups.
“We really encourage students who are interested in being entrepreneurs to take advantage of the different resources available to them on campus. Whether it would be student organizations such as Spark SC or offices such as the USC Career Center,” Ginchansky said.
Jean Zhang, a senior majoring in psychology, commented on the importance of passion while creating a startup.
“The most interesting fact I learned today is that passion really stands out when you want to get involved. It really doesn’t matter what your background is, because you can build that, but you really do need the passion there,” said Zhang.
Legassick said that the panel is beneficial because it gives students interested in becoming entrepreneurs an idea of the process ahead.
“There is a lot to be done in Los Angeles; there are so many opportunities for students to get involved in the startup industry in L.A.,” Legassick said. “I think this event is important because it provides exposure to something I think students think is not tangible or have access to.”

The fight for a wage increase for campus hospitality workers intensified Thursday evening, with nearly 200 demonstrators protesting throughout the University Park campus.
The rally, hosted by the UNITE HERE Local 11 labor union and the Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice (CLUE-LA), in conjunction with the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, is the most recent demonstration in a campaign that began last November.
“When I came to work at USC, I thought it would be better for my children, that I would be better off here to be part of the Trojan family,” said Abigail Lopez, an employee at the on-campus restaurant Lemonade. “But after a while, when you notice your check and how hard you work, how it’s not fair … you realize we’re like the lower-class citizen.”
Local 11, a union for hospitality and service workers in Los Angeles and an affiliate of the national union UNITE HERE, is campaigning for two main changes to the recently expired contract between the union and the university: a $15 per hour wage and full-time hours for employees.
“Most people who work at USC do not have 40 hours of work, maybe 36, 35,” said Ofelia Carrillo, a member of the communications team for the union. “Some people have been here for 42 years and still do not have full-time work.”
The university employs roughly 900 hospitality workers, and the workers’ current contract has been expired since June 30. In the six months since, union and university officials have not been able to reach an agreement.
Though the university has offered a wage increase of 25 cents, many workers stress it isn’t sufficient.
“Twenty-five cents is not enough for us to survive,” said Renita Shepard, an employee at Lemonade.
Wednesday’s rally began at 4 p.m., with community members, students, workers and union coordinators congregating at the United University Church on the north side of campus.
From there, the protesters separated into seven locations across campus, including the Radisson Hotel at USC, the on-campus restaurant Moreton Fig and the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
The separate groups then gathered in Hahn Plaza at approximately 5:30 p.m., where for about 30 minutes the demonstrators marched in a large circle that spread across the university square.
“[USC officials] sit in their suits and think they have the power, but there is nothing more powerful than students and workers and community coming together,” said SCALE member Sarah Newell at the demonstration. “This is the moment where USC changes, and we will fight until it is right.”
This rally is the first official demonstration of the semester, with one previously being held in November. SCALE member Jenny Vallegas shared that the union is fully organizing the workers’ campaign, and that the students involved are instead standing in solidarity with the workers as representatives of the USC community.
“We’re here to leverage our privilege as students and to speak up on what is going on,” Villegas said. “We have stakeholdership, we pay tuition.”
The union campaign, dubbed “Let’s Raise SC!”, states that the average yearly wage for USC hospitality workers is approximately $18,800, citing a university statistic. Workers active in the cause stressed that the earnings are not enough to live in Los Angeles.
“At the standard we are at right now, we are barely surviving,” said Paco Torres, a worker at the student dining hall Cafe 84. “We’re living check-to-check.”
Carillo shared that the yearly wage statistic was sent to the union by the university and was not union-calculated. University officials could not confirm the number as of press time.
In a statement, USC maintained that they are confident a contract agreement will be reached and spoke to the benefits Local 11 employees receive at the university.
“In addition to wage and health benefits that compare very favorably to similar settings outside the university, Local 11 employees at USC also are eligible for some other valuable university benefits offered to faculty and staff, including free tuition for themselves and their dependents, retirement contributions from the university and more,” Thomas Sayles, senior vice president for university relations, wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “We also provide extensive training, and through that training, the opportunity for upward mobility in their employment here.”
The protest comes at the heels of President C. L. Max Nikias’ announcement to the campus community on Tuesday that the university had reached the $4 billion mark of USC’s $6 billion fundraising initiative. Nearly $732 million was garnered in gifts in 2014 alone.
This is not the first time the union has demonstrated at USC. One hospitality worker in particular, Maria Villalobos, shared that this is the third protest campaign she’s participated in over the 42 years she has worked at USC. Los Angeles County labor leader Maria Elena Durazo, who was a key part of the union’s last campaign in the 2000s, stressed that this is not a fight that the campus workers will give up soon.
“If we have to prove again to USC that we will fight until fairness and justice are reached in the union contract, then we will walk out, we will strike, we will picket, we will march, we will get arrested,” said Durazo, currently vice president for immigration, civil rights and diversity at UNITE HERE. “We will fight back, and we will win.”

Correction: A previous version of this story stated the rally was hosted by UNITE HERE Local 11 labor union and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation. It was actually hosted by UNITE HERE Local 11 labor union, the Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice (CLUE-LA) and the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
