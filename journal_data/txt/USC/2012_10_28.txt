After a month of road trips in front of hostile crowds and tough opponents, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team finally returned home to face Cal Lutheran  and Pacific on Saturday and did what it has done consistently throughout 2012: win handily over a team it was expected to beat.

“We love being at home,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Everything is more comfortable. I thought we played well after the first quarter, the defense and James Clark played excellent. Offensively we were strong the whole game, so I was very happy with that.”
The Trojans’ businesslike menatility is truly something to marvel at. The team is 20-0 this season, and though only a handful of games have been highly contested (top-5 teams such as Stanford, California, and UCLA all have pushed USC to the brink), every other team that has faced USC has been utterly beaten.
“We talk about staying focused a lot, and we understand that it’s important to be prepared,” Vavic said. “Our guys believe in it. You can talk about it all you want, but if you don’t believe in it, then it’s just talk. Our guys realize how every opponent can beat you, so they take care of business, prepare, train hard, and we have great leadership.”
On Saturday, USC started slow, and the first period featured seven goals scored — four for the Trojans and three for Pacific. Pacific actually led 3-2 late in the first before two quick goals by junior driver Stephen Siri and senior driver Tobias Preuss gave the Trojans a lead that they would not relinquish.
“Pacific didn’t do anything that we didn’t expect,” Vavic said. “We made a few careless individual mistakes and let them score a couple of goals. But we did a good job the rest of the game. Excluding the first quarter, our defense was good.”
In the second quarter, USC established its superiority with three straight goals to start the frame. After a Pacific goal on a penalty shot, Preuss assisted on junior two-meter Jeremy Davie’s goal to give the Trojans an 8-4 halftime lead.
The third quarter was much of the same. Led by junior goalie James Clark, who finished with 12 saves, USC’s defense suffocated the Tigers’ attack. Pacific scored on another five-meter penalty shot in the third quarter to make the score 9-5 before the Trojans went on a 4-0 run with goals from Preuss, senior driver Michael Rosenthal, and sophomore driver Marc Vonderweidt. The goal from Preuss gave the senior a hat trick, tying him for the game high with junior driver Kostas Genidounias, who has now scored 36 goals on the season.
“You want to see five guys scoring a goal,” Vavic said. “It’s always good for the team to be balance like that. It’s good for the confidence of each player. You don’t want to see just one or two players scoring and everyone else watching.”
In this latest step toward another championship, the Trojans started slow before exerting their dominance and avoiding an upset.
“Last week, Berkley beat Stanford, then Long Beach went to Berkley and beat them,” Vavic said, citing instances of upsets of top-ranked teams. “Teams are getting upset, and we did not allow that to happen this week.”

The USC women’s soccer team spent the weekend battling two of the toughest opponents the Pac-12 has to offer, fighting until the very end both times. Unfortunately, USC (5-10-3, 2-6-2) fell 1-0 to both  No. 1 Stanford (15-1-1, 9-0-0) at the Los Angeles Coliseum in double overtime and No. 21 California (15-4-0, 8-2-0).

“I think it has a real positive impact on us moving forward, but right now it becomes a little frustrating for them,” said USC coach Ali Khosroshahin, when asked about playing eight overtime games in a season. “Not getting the bounces, not getting the results. We just gotta fight on here.”
USC’s contest against California went back and forth all game, with both teams almost even in shots (15-14 USC) and corners (4-3 California). Unfortunately, USC caught an unlucky break when Cal’s Ifeoma Onumonu hit a shot from across the field, scoring the only goal of the match on a shot to the far left post.
“The girls are definitely resilient. They’ve been through a lot this year, a lot of heartbreaks,” Khosroshahin said. “They don’t quit. They keep working and they keep fighting on.”
Junior midfielder Jordan Marada led the Trojans with four shots, while sophomore goalkeeper Caroline Stanley racked up three saves.
“We got a whole lot of talent and everybody puts their heart out there every single time, said junior midfielder Elizabeth Eddy. “That’s gonna take us to the next level.”
The Coliseum served as a fitting backdrop as the game featured the two Pac-12 teams to ever win an NCAA women’s soccer championship. Even though Stanford outshot USC 25-12, both teams had an equal amount of scoring opportunities. The game went into overtime, USC’s eighth of the season and only Stanford’s second, where things continued to heat up.
The 2011 champs caught a lucky break, as the 2007 champs appeared to win the game on a goal from the box by Jordan Marada, but the goal was nullified because of an offsides call while the celebrations started. Freshman forward Katie Johnson attempted to give USC the win for good on a feed from Eddy, but the shot was stopped by Stanford goalkeeper Emily Oliver, pushing the game into a second overtime.
Stanford took advantage of a USC foul in the 103rd minute to seal the win, as Alina Garciamendez nailed the game-winning goal.
“Stanford is an incredible team,” sophomore goalkeeper Caroline Stanley said. “They were national champions last year, we knew we were in for a fight. I could not be prouder of these girls for the way they fought throughout the whole game. Tonight proved that we can keep up with these teams, and I have no doubt in my mind that we can beat teams like this.”
USC plays its final regular season game at McAlister Field on Friday against No. 2 UCLA at 2:00 p.m. The game will be televised on Pac-12 Network Los Angeles.
I agree with the previous post. The team is loaded with talent but he doesn’t know how to motivate or adjust when necessary.It is definitely time for some fresh blood. Are you listening A.D. Haden???
The Ali era has run its course. If there is any doubt check the record. I’ve seen many of the SC players play prior to college and they don’t look like the same players.  None of them have progressed or improved or developed. None of the players exhibit the confidence they used to exude.  SC soccer needs the likes of Snow or Ratcliffe. Both coaches know how to properly use, coach and motivate their players and are willing to make necessary changes instead of doing the same thing over and over again. It’s not working!

The No. 7 USC women’s volleyball team did not enter this weekend’s games at the Galen Center simply to win — it wanted to make a statement. A Friday night matchup against a No. 1 Washington team that was responsible for one of USC’s three losses was apparently the perfect opportunity for redemption.

The Women of Troy played arguably their most thrilling game of the season Friday, knocking down the Huskies in five grueling sets before a sweep of the Washington State Cougars on Saturday night. The victories boost No. 7 USC’s record to 21-3 overall and 9-3 in Pac-12 play.
“Just to win these games is extremely good,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “We wanted to get better as a team, and I think we accomplished that. We also got our confidence up to a pretty good level.”
Though the Cougars gave their all Saturday night, they simply couldn’t match up with the Women of Troy, who recorded their 15th sweep of the season with a 25-13, 25-17, 25-18 victory. They were particularly dominant in the first set, as the Women of Troy built an insurmountable 21-9 lead before freshman middle blocker Alicia Ogoms knocked down consecutive kills to seal the set.
The second set was a similar story, as Shaw recorded a kill to put USC up 19-9. The Cougars rebounded to make it close, but Young notched consecutive kills before an attack error gave the Women of Troy the set. The hosts put on a hitting clinic, attacking at a .600 clip in the opening frame before hitting .316 in the middle set.
The final set was much tighter, as the Cougars rebounded from a 15-8 hole to come to within 16-15. The Women of Troy, however, went on a 6-1 run, highlighted by three alternating Shaw kills, the last of which sealed the match for the Women of Troy.
“We played a lot of people, and we got to practice the game situations and be successful,” Haley said. “I felt like we had a successful weekend after practicing to our strengths.”
Against the Huskies, the Women of Troy were once again paced by freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio, who took advantage of the five-set match by registering a career-high 30 kills and 12 digs to help take out the Huskies. Throughout both games, though, junior outside hitter Sara Shaw rose to center stage. After recording 15 kills and a career high 30 digs against Washington, she posted a career-high 18 kills against the Cougars, notching a .643 hitting percentage with no errors.
“The Washington match was definitely a tough one for us, but I think it was a good five games,” Shaw said. “Coming back to win that match definitely boosted our confidence.”
Against the Huskies, the Women of Troy twice had to come back from deficits to win, an unfamiliar situation considering the dominance with which they’ve been able to put opponents away from the start. After falling behind 2-1, the Women of Troy fought hard during the fourth set, taking the Huskies to an 18-all tie before registering four straight points to go up 22-20. Bricio then knocked down a powerful kill to take the set 25-23 and tie the match at two apiece.
It was only fitting that the fifth and final set was as close as the others, as the teams were tied at eight before the Women of Troy ran away with it. Senior opposite Katie Fuller knocked down a kill for a 13-9 lead, after which junior libero Natalie Hagglund and sophomore setter Emily Young combined to set up Bricio for a kill to end the set 15-10 and claim the match for the hosts.
“When we left Washington, we felt like we should have won, even though they beat us 3-0 up there,” Haley said. “We weren’t in sync in that match. I thought that we could have won in three [sets] over here, but we made too many errors in the beginning. However, as we kept playing we got more and more confident, so winning in five was fine.”
After the perfect, two-week homestand, the Women of Troy will again hit the road, with games at  Arizona State and Arizona this weekend.
“Winning on the road is extremely important for us, because we have six of our ten matches on the road in the second round,” Haley said. “We’ll take them one at a time, and we need to take them seriously and prepare for that.”

TUCSON, Ariz. — Well, we learned a lot of things Saturday about the Trojans.
Most of them, unfortunately, weren’t so good.
On his heels · Robert Woods set the all-time USC receptions record against Colorado, but Marqise Lee appears primed to catch him next season. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley threw for 493 yards, a school record. But he threw two interceptions and missed a wide-open Robert Woods down the sideline that might have put the game out of reach for Arizona.
The USC defense? That one that was built to defend the spread? Not so much. They gave up 26 straight points yesterday and couldn’t get off the field at the end of the contest.
Oh, and “Unfinished Business” is officially finished. There will be no national title this year (though I wouldn’t count the Rose Bowl out quite yet).
But there was one positive that came out of yesterday. And it came in the form of sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee.
Lee caught 16 passes for 345 yards and two touchdowns. Four of those receptions were for 40 or more yards.
Lee took five-yard slants and turned them into 50-yard gains. He looked like the best player in football Saturday. There was no one on that field who could have stopped Lee.
I’ve been wanting to write this column for a long time now; I’ve thought about it since the first game against Hawai’i. So here we go: Marqise Lee is the best player in college football.
This comes with apologies to Kansas State quarterback Collin Klein, who is the presumptive favorite to win the Heisman trophy right now, or Manti Te’o, the Notre Dame linebacker who could be the first defensive player to win the sport’s most prestigious award since Charles Woodson. But Lee is the most explosive, most consistent player I have seen in a long time.
USC has had some great receivers in recent years: Mike Williams, Steve Smith, Dwayne Jarrett and even Robert Woods.
But Lee’s ability to get down the field and make plays with the ball in his hands is unparalleled.
To put it in perspective: Lee’s 345 yards were the fifth-most in a single game in college football history. The USC record was 260 yards; he almost had that at the half.
I guess when it comes down to it, the Heisman doesn’t always go to the nation’s best player; it goes to the one with the most hype who comes up clutch in big moments. Robert Griffin III was the perfect example; his last second, game-winning touchdown pass against Oklahoma in 2011 was the iconic moment of the college football season.
Lee has single-handedly kept USC in several games this season. Against Utah, it was his 83-yard reception that sealed the win for the Trojans. Against Stanford, Lee’s playmaking down the field was the lone bright spot in an otherwise atrocious offensive performance by the team.
And then there was Saturday.
Lee was the reason USC’s offense had any sort of success. The running game wasn’t great. Woods wasn’t tearing things up. And when players weren’t dropping passes, they were committing personal fouls.
But Lee caught everything that came his way. Even when a pass was off, it still stuck to his hands. Then, he ran with the ball like there was no one around him.
And remember, it was his 72-yard kickoff return that set the Trojans up for their touchdown in the waning minutes of the ball game.
I don’t think there is a player in college football that means more to his team than Marqise Lee.
With apologies to Barkley, who I have the utmost respect for, Lee makes this team go. When things are stagnant, he is the go-to guy.
And when Lee doesn’t get the ball? Well, that’s what happened against the Wildcats in the second half. The Trojans could only muster 15 more points. In other words, the offense disappears.
I know that one big game from a player doesn’t make a season or mean a player should get postseason accolades. But Lee’s performance in Tucson was a microcosm of everything he has done the entire season: He has put the team on his back and has consistently been the best player on the field at all times, bar none.
Marqise Lee is the best player in college football — and I don’t even think it is particularly close. And if he doesn’t get invited to New York for the Heisman Trophy ceremony, it will be the biggest travesty since Barkley wasn’t invited in 2011.
So, USC fans, things aren’t looking as good as they could be. And Oregon and Notre Dame, both heavy hitters, loom around the corner.
But with Lee on the squad, there is one thing that Trojan spectators and fans can be assured of: They are watching the best player in college football every time No. 9 steps on the field.

TUCSON, Ariz. — Any hopes then-No. 9 USC had of playing in Miami for the BCS National Title game are essentially gone.
Trailing by three points, the Trojans were unable to convert a late Hail Mary attempt as time expired, losing 39-36 at Arizona Stadium.
Tough to take · USC junior wide receiver Robert Woods walks off the field after losing to Arizona, 36-39. Despite a USC-record 493 passing yards from senior quarterback Matt Barkley, the Trojans were unable to hold off the Wildcats. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Despite a school-record 345 receiving yards from sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee, the Trojans’ 13 penalties and five turnovers ultimately led to their downfall.
“It was a very discouraging loss today,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “We made a lot of mistakes and weren’t able to catch up.”
The game was filled with penalties and strange calls for USC (6-2, 4-2) from the onset. After receiving the opening kickoff, junior running back Silas Redd appeared to score on a 34-yard touchdown run, but officials ruled he was down after he spun off an Arizona defender and his elbow touched the ground.
Senior quarterback Matt Barkley, who threw for a school-record 493 yards on the afternoon to go along with his three touchdown passes, was intercepted off a tipped pass with 9:15 left in the first quarter. A taunting penalty by senior safety T.J. McDonald left the Trojans’s defense on the field after what should have been a three-and-out. Arizona quarterback Matt Scott threw an eight-yard touchdown later on in the drive, to make it 7-0 for the Wildcats.
Lee caught a 57-yard pass on first-and-30 later in the first quarter. But on fourth-and-2, Barkley missed sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble in the end zone and the Trojans gave the ball back to Arizona (5-3, 1-3). The Wildcats finished the opening frame up 10-0.
“We made plays out there; there’s no question about the playmaking of our guys,” Barkley said. “But we just kept cheating ourselves early in the game.”
The second quarter didn’t start much better for the Trojans, as Redd fumbled at the Arizona 10-yard line. The Trojans’ defense held, however, and forced a Wildcat punt.
With 11:12 left in the half, Lee caught another deep pass, this one for 50 yards. The Trojans scored with a little more than 10 minutes left when Barkley hit Grimble in the flat, after which he took it upfield.
Barkley was intercepted on the next Trojan drive, though, giving the Wildcats the ball at the 34-yard line. But Arizona failed to convert a fourth-and-5, and Lee again made a highlight-reel play on the ensuing possession.
Lee took a short slant pass 49 yards and blazed past Wildcat defenders, giving the Trojans their first lead of the day at 14-10. Starling intercepted a Scott pass but was stripped by an Arizona player, which gave the Wildcats the ball at the 28-yard line. Arizona made the most of it by hitting a 44-yard field goal to cut the Trojan lead to one.
After a couple more big plays from Lee, D.J. Morgan took it in from the three-yard line. USC took a 21-13 lead into the locker room.
“We all know he’s a special player,” Barkley said of Lee. “All the yards after the catch and what he can do with the ball.”
Things looked as if they might have finally turned around for the Trojans after halftime, as they got off to a fast start in the third quarter. Lee caught a 44-yard touchdown to break R. Jay Soward’s school record of  260 yards and Mike Hass’ conference record of 293 receiving yards in a game.
The Wildcats, as was the theme the entire game, responded with four minutes left in the third.  Scott scored on a quarterback draw to bring Arizona closer at 28-20. Sophomore running back D.J. Morgan fumbled on the next drive and the Wildcats capitalized with a touchdown pass from Scott to receiver Dan Buckner. They missed the two-point conversion, trailing the Trojans 28-26.
The fourth quarter, however, was when things fell apart.
Arizona took a 32-28 lead with 10:46 left in the fourth after the Trojans failed to convert a fourth-and-two attempt. They scored again on Scott’s third scoring pass of the day with just under six minutes left in the game.
“They did what they had to do to win,” junior cornerback Nickell Robey said. “We gave a lot of effort and we played the best game we can play. The effort level we had today was remarkable.”
Lee returned the ensuing kickoff 72 yards, and the Trojans scored on a 10-yard touchdown run from Redd. USC converted a two-point try on a pass to Lee, bringing the Arizona lead to just 39-36.
That was as close as it would get, though.
The Trojans got the ball back with just under a minute left, and had the chance to win the game on a last second Hail Mary. Lee had a chance to secure a jump ball in the endzone as time expired, but lost the ball in a scrum of Arizona defenders.
“You never know. Those are kind of throw-up plays,” Barkley said of the last-second heave. “I don’t think it should have come down to a play like that in the first place. It’s unfortunate that it did.”
After the disappointing loss, the Trojans face No. 4 Oregon on Nov. 3 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
“At the end of the day, we didn’t make the plays — all the credit to Arizona,” sophomore cornerback Josh Shaw said. “Now we’ve just got to regroup, come back and we have a big week ahead. Guys are kind of down right now … but we’ll come back.”
Kickoff for the next game, which will be televised on FOX, is set for 4 p.m.
Do none of you understand how thin this football team is? We aren’t able to sub easily, so these players will get tired and make mental mistakes. Don’t put this on the coach. Hindsight is 20/20 – if that reverse worked, you’d think he’s a genius. Some real fair weather fans here.
Between the inane offensive play calling (a REVERSE on 4th and 2??????), the total ineptitude of the defense, and a complete failure to work the game clock, tonight’s game proved that it is time for Lane and Monty Kiffin to be put out to pasture.
There is no question that we have the talent on the field, but the talent on the sidelines is definitely lacking. If USC wants to regain its football dominance, it must do so without the albatross of the Kiffins.
The Pete Carroll era was a magical time, and one that probably won’t be replicated soon, but we can learn a lot of his coaching style. Even in the face of losses, Carroll maintained a positive attitude and exuded a true love of the game. He motivated the players and kept the fans reassured. In fact, most of the time you saw Carroll during the game, he’d have a smile on his face. In short, Pete Carroll exemplified what it is to be a Trojan in a way that the abrasive, glowering asshole, Lane Kiffin, never will.
I agree…while I am a junior transfer and know almost next to nothing about football…from what I have seen, it is time for Kiffin to go….out with the lame and in with the winners…we have too many penalties and too many poor plays that we have run. Part of our losses are due to the players (mainly for the stupid penaliteis) and part of it is the coaching staff. We need new blood in this schools football team… that simple
And where do you suppose this will come from? As someone who doesn’t know much about football, what credibility do you have? If we have a new coach, we’ll be rebuilding again, which will be even WORSE because of the sanctions. Who would come here willingly with our recruiting sanctions? And how can you possibly expect more success when we have those limitations and an entirely new system with players that Kiffin currently has most likely won’t adjust to quickly?
Kiffin inherited these sanctions. Let him ride them out and see this through. Our offensive line is our weak spot – we are thin there due to injuries and sanctions. The Stanford loss exposed us there. If we turn away now, things can only go south. All of these thoughts like yours are typical overreactions, and thankfully Pat Haden will ignore this. Besides, penalties and turnovers are the fault of the players. Think!
Manny,
What I remember are each of the losses we have endured because Daddy Kiffin couldn’t make a key stop: Washington, Stanford, Notre Dame in 2010; Stanford last year, and Stanford and Arizona this year.  Lame is bad enough, with an undisciplined team that commits dumb penalty after dumb penalty.  However, Daddy’s  “D” stinks and too often renders moot a good effort by the offense.
Time to wake up and smell the coffee: Lame had done NOTHING to deserve being named the SC coach in the first place, and he has done even less to merit retaining that position.
Stanford has been consistently a good team, much to our detriment – we truly found out the power of that front seven this year (I’ll admit I underestimated it). The other games have just been sloppy execution (or in Notre Dame’s case, a backup QB that played poorly) via penalties or turnovers combined with a shaky offensive line. You can coach those mistakes out of players all you want, but it’s up to them to execute, which they aren’t doing. Barkley and Redd have been turnover machines – their decision making is suspect this year.
8-5 and 10-2 doesn’t merit retaining the position after two years? Especially considering the past two years were supposed to lead to USC falling out of the rankings for years to come via the sanctions? I’d say he’s done a decent job considering everything.
Carroll hadn’t beaten a team in the state of Oregon for years. His teams lost at least once every year to a lesser opponent except for the championship years. Kiffin’s team last year goes up and puts an a** kicking on the dominant Ducks. Had it not been for a few execution errors against a good Stanford team last year, we’d be 11-1.
Who in your mind is “worthy” of our program that has been underachieving for almost a decade?
(sorry to double post) Not to mention, who would be willing to pick up our sanctions as new coach and maintain the consistently good USC pro style? A coach with a spread offense a la West Virginia or Oregon would make me vomit.
I don’t see them going anywhere, nor should they yet.
How quickly sour some people get over a loss like this. Do you not remember 10-2 last year, blowing Oregon out of the water? Kiffin has plenty of talent – Barkley has definitely regressed this season, and killing this team are the turnovers, many of which come from Barkley. He of all people should know better, as a four year starter. My confidence in him has been shaken. The Kiffins have been doing fine as coaches, in my opinion. It’s the execution that is killing this team – the fundamentals just aren’t kept in mind on the field. A coach can only do so much if the players themselves are the ones tripping themselves.
Agree with Tommy – I didn’t like Lane as the offensive coordinator under Pete, and I don’t like him now as the head coach.  His play calling is suspect at best, downright terrible at worst.  His coaching leaves a lot to be desired as well – the number of penalties USC has been committing is totally down to the coach enforcing discipline on the team.  I understand he’s under extra pressure due to scholarship limitations, but that’s not enough of an excuse, especially for the personal fouls that are just borne out of stupid play.  Hold, pass interference, those are understandable in tight games.  Late hits, “targeting”, taunting, those types of penalties have no excuse, and the coach should punish the offenders.
How long will the Trojan Family put up with the Lame Kiffins??  Once again, Daddy Kiffin’s “defense” blows a lead and can’t make a key stop.  Meanwhile, the “Boy Wonder” manages to waste the talents of Barkley and the heroics of Marquise Lee.  I’m not sure what Pat Haden thinks is going to happen with this pitiful excuse for a coaching staff, but they should be on notice that the  Men of Troy and the Trojan Family deserve more than this level of incompetence.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has gotten a lot of flak for his antiquated views on some social issues that, though not the focal points of this election, mean everything to some voters. Despite a conservative fiscal policy and a focus on strong national defense that many young Republicans support, Romney’s anti-gay marriage stance eliminates him as an option for voters who see his position as antithetical to fundamental civil liberties.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
In an age that is increasingly supportive of equal rights for people of all sexual orientations, it is vital for the survival and viability of the GOP that the official party platform change to one that states its support for gay marriage. Without such a change, candidates like Romney will become less and less likely to gain office as the current generation of open-minded young adults grows up and becomes more influential within the electorate.
Romney’s stances on gay marriage are more specific than those of his party’s 2012 platform, but the pre-convention outline of Republican issue statements includes the concept of “traditional marriage” as something that must be defended.
Though opposition to gay marriage is the official position of the GOP in this election cycle, the tide of public opinion is starting to turn thanks to young people who understand that there is nothing socially subversive about two men or two women loving and marrying each other. In fact, it is socially subversive and dangerous to the future of civil liberties in the United States to categorically deny people a right as fundamental as freedom to enter into marriage contracts.
The GOP’s disapproval of gay marriage is inconsistent with individual liberties, something which the party normally promotes. This could make some socially progressive conservatives think twice about supporting the party in elections.
The current generation of college students has proved to be more socially liberal than their predecessors, especially when it comes to civil liberties. According to a study conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA, upward of 71 percent of college students who were freshmen in 2011 supported gay marriage — up from 64.9 percent two years earlier.
Such a significant increase in support for gay rights over this short period of time speaks to this generation of young people’s dedication to equal rights for all. The GOP’s failure thus far to catch up to this freedom-oriented mentality will not bode well for its political future if things do not change soon.
The Democratic Party, on the other hand, threw its official support behind gay marriage in September by inserting an explicitly pro-gay rights stance into its party platform. This first time platform addition came a little more than a year after the Obama administration came out in support of the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would repeal the federal government’s ban on gay marriage as outlined in the Defense of Marriage Act.
Romney, however, has pledged to appoint an attorney general that will defend a discriminatory act that Obama has declared unconstitutional. Not only would Romney support DOMA, but he would propose and promote what he calls the Federal Marriage Amendment to the Constitution defining marriage as being strictly between a man and a woman.
Such close-minded views within the Republican Party should be rethought, as should support for the politicians that tout its values. As a generation that understands this, college students who support marriage equality must continue to spread the message of liberty and equal rights for all by supporting candidates that espouse these values and speaking out against discrimination.
Without a modernized stance on civil rights issues such as gay marriage, the Republican Party could seriously damage its chances for success. It might not happen with this election, but it is time for the Grand Old Party to stop being so old in its close-minded rejection of gay rights.

Don’t talk to me about Social Issues…as if it ONLY applies to Republicans.
Democrats…how about YOUR Social Issues?
Are you really & truly proud of the fact that you & your party support the
merciless killing of a Human life that is struggling to be born?
If you had a back-bone, you’d watch an ACTUAL abortion taking place (e.g. on U-Tube)
and then tell the rest of us how your “Social Issues” compare to ours.
Somethings are worth fighting for.
Your self-ish-ness is Pathetic.
You should be ashamed that you were born …but you prevent others from being born.
And lastly, these social issues are merely an afterthought in the average American voter’s mind–they care about the >8% unemployment rate, jobs being shipped overseas, illegal immigration and economic growth. If you think that this election (despite the Democrats’ best efforts) is about social issues like gay marriage, you are sorely mistaken.
At least, in my opinion, it shouldn’t be. Just like Santorum going after abortion: making this an election about social issues is wrong. I’m flabbergasted to see people pushing aside the economy for issues like this. I personally am fine w/ gay marriage, provided it doesn’t increase my tax burden/costs, but this election has gotten out of hand with respect to social issues that need to take a back seat for the time being.
Well Sarah historically the college campuses have been bastions of social (and yes, even economic) liberalism dating back to the 1960s. I’m sure if you would have taken a poll back then about drug legalization, an overwhelming majority of students would be in favor of pot and acid trips, distribution of wealth, and the abolition of our armed forces–college campuses were notorious for banning ROTC offices back then. The Republican party has steadfastly been in favor of the war on drugs, increasing American military might, and economic conservatism and yet we have somehow survived these past 150+ years. If you were to approach those same hippies on college campuses today, they would be doctors, lawyers, bankers and workers and significantly more conservative. You will notice, as your column title so aptly puts, American minds “bend toward intelligence” with age.

When someone decides to vote for a third-party presidential candidate, a common response is, “Your vote doesn’t count.” The general consensus is that no party besides the Republicans or Democrats can win an election.
But there are more than two political parties recognized by the United States, including the Libertarian Party, Green Party and Constitution Party, to name a few. Each third party has a unique perspective on what the role of government is, but few citizens even know who’s running for third parties or what they stand for. The problem at hand is voters’ doubts perpetuated by the already-established two-party system that any third party will ever become large and powerful enough to make a difference in the presidential elections.
The reason that no third parties or their candidates have become prominent is because of a negative cycle in which voters have no faith in a smaller party’s chances and therefore don’t vote for them. Voters should make an effort to break this cycle and recognize there are multiple options beyond President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney — especially in an election where many voters are on the fence about voting for either candidate.
Of the three independent parties, the one that tends to receive the most recognition by the public, if any, is the Green Party.
The Green Party is fairly new — the party as it exists today was officially founded in 1991 with a commitment to environmentalism, non-violence, social justice and grassroots organizing. A former Green Party presidential candidate whose name voters might actually recognize is Ralph Nader, who only received 738,475 votes in the 2000 presidential election, according to the Federal Election Commission.
Despite Nader’s more prominent reputation, it’s safe to assume most voters don’t know the name of current Green Party nominee Jill Stein, one of the third-party candidates for the 2012 presidential election. Though Stein does not have a political record equal to Romney’s or Obama’s, her career and commitments offer unique qualifications that would appeal to many voters. A physician and environmental-health advocate, Stein’s platform is all about abortion rights, marriage equality, free college education, addressing climate change and renewable energy.
Stein also addresses the greatest concern of the 2012 election, the economy, in a plan that combines green with green — that is, global green with monetary green. Her economic plan, known as the Green New Deal, is a four-part plan focused on reducing economic inequality and creating more sustainable communities. Stein plans to reform the government in conjunction with the economy because, according to her website, “we won’t get these vital reforms without a … real, functioning democracy.”
The fact that so many voters could relate to what Stein stands for and yet have not been exposed to her platform is a critical problem. A main cause of the lack of public knowledge about third-party candidates stems from narrow media coverage. The media almost exclusively focuses on the battle between Obama and Romney, leaving the other candidates at the margins.
The public and the media imagine the United States as a two- party system — when in reality it’s not. This can only be changed by increased voter awareness and a removal of the stigma that surrounds third parties. Or even worse, they choose to opt out of voting entirely.
All voters should consider that there are more than two candidates to vote for and take it upon themselves to research third-party candidates, especially if they are disenchanted with Obama and Romney.
Perhaps the government has dug itself too deep into a divided hole when what it needs is a do-over in the form of a prominent new party. After $16 trillion of government debt, a recession and an unemployment rate that affects people all over the country, is it not time for America to hit the reset button and let someone else take the wheel?
 
Morgan Greenwald is a freshman majoring in neuroscience and health promotion and disease prevention studies. 
Tax cuts “cost” nothing. Taxes are a taking of one’s lawfully obtained income. Just because politicians want to spend money they don’t have doesn’t make my income theirs. 
Overspending to transfer the income of one person to another is a wrongful use of the taxing power. Fighting wars on a credit card is dangerously Roman Empire like. Barack Obama continued and expanded on the shameful Bush Doctrine of preemptive war.
As long as we allow overspending politicians to stay in office, we will have overspending and less income than we would otherwise have. Do you want to spend your income or should someone else do it for you?
Finally, I am completely surprised when almost everyone thinks its just Romney or Obama as the ONLY 2 choices. Their is other choices, ones that actually have a robust and detailed platform. Like Ms. Greenwald has mentioned the Green New Deal.
Throwing your vote is voting for neither party you want but you do anyway, because you want your vote to count. Voting a third party might not get them becoming president but it can start a revolution. The higher the votes for third parties pushes those parties to more mainstream media. Gives them more election funding. Shows the 2 main parties that people want change and will not listen to their pandering of the masses.
Amen! I am an independent and am sick of both of the “main” parties. Both are trash and/or overly exaggerated, in my opinion. My only problem is that the third-party candidates this year have also been at extremes. There just doesn’t seem to be a middle-ground party anywhere – it’s depressing.
The very second this President took office the country was bleeding 3/4 million jobs a MONTH.
We were into 3 rounds of stimulus with George Bush and he had started the initial auto bailout by the time he was done.
We gave a ‘temporary’ tax cut (that has thus far cost us 1.5 trillion to the top 5%) in another round of George Bush stimulus. By the time this President assumed office there was talk of the next ‘Great Depression’.
In less than 4 years we are showing real recovery and still investing in the future.
Like millions of Americans, I have already cast my ballot for the President, I implore the good people of this great nation to do the same.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Thursday, Oct. 25, and Friday, Oct. 26. 
 
Crimes against property
at 3:58 a.m. on Oct. 26, DPS received a report of a suspect smashed a second floor lobby window in Harris Residence Hall, pushed out the screen and then tossed a table and several chairs out the window.
At 2:21 A.M. on Oct. 26, DPS officers responded to a report of a theft inside Phi Gamma Delta. Upon their arrival, they located two students who reported two unidentified females removed their cellular phones from a restroom counter.  The officers questioned three non-USC females, but while they were conducting their investigation a fraternity member found the phones in a second floor room.  Once their phones were returned, the students declined criminal prosecution of the matter and the officers cleared the scene.
at 9:20 a.m. on Oct. 25, DPS officers on foot patrol at the University Village food court were flagged down by a witness who directed them to a suspect who had been observed possibly removing property from a storage room. The officers detained the suspect for investigation and transported him to Southwest station after a check of his name revealed multiple outstanding warrants. Further investigation revealed that the warrants did not belong to the suspect and he was released after being advised against trespassing on university property.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 1:38 a.m. on Oct. 26, DPS officers responded to a report of a student and a non-USC male involved in an altercation at 1249 29th St. and detained them for investigation. The officers determined that the fight started when the male followed the student onto the student’s property and refused to leave the premises. Neither party desired criminal prosecution of the matter and they were both subsequently released.
at 7:11 p.m. on Oct. 25, marijuana and a pipe were found inside a staff member’s lunch box at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center and he was subsequently arrested, cited and released by DPS officers.
at 12:59 P.m. on Oct. 25, DPS officers on routine patrol saw two students who collided with each other while riding their bicycles in the alley behind Cardinal Gardens. One of the students complained of injuries to her back, shoulder and hip, so a Los Angeles Fire Department Rescue Ambulance unit was requested. RA Unit #814 responded and examined the student, who was then released to the officers and transported to the Student Health Center for medical treatment. The second student was also injured, but she declined medical treatment.
at 6:48 p.m. on Oct. 25, DPS officers responded to Twin Palms Apartments to check on the welfare of a student after her sister reported she had been unable to contact her.  The officers found the student unharmed inside her apartment, who stated she was unable to receive calls because her phone battery was dead. The officers then cleared the scene.
This week’s lessons:
1) Don’t bring dope to work
2) Charge your phone regularly
And dont invite non USC chicks who steal your iphones into your pad.

Faculty and students from the Viterbi School of Engineering will collaborate with K-12 schools in the Los Angeles area through the Viterbi Adopt-a-School, Adopt-a-Teacher outreach program, according to a statement released last week.
The program will work to provide K-12 science, technology, engineering and mathematics students and teachers with an opportunity to connect with college students and Viterbi faculty.
Through VAST, the university hopes to encourage mentorship, support instruction, play an active role in the classroom and provide K-12 faculty with training and development opportunities, according to the statement.
“This is an as-yet untapped resource that will bring the two communities together in ways that will benefit all,” said Maja Mataric, professor and vice dean for research at Viterbi.
And the opportunity will be beneficial for both of the communities Mataric mentions: the college and the surrounding schools and students.
VAST has been designed so that all the participants will benefit from their involvement, according to a statement. The program, which will encourage all Viterbi faculty to be involved, will foster community outreach and a love and understanding of science and engineering for a new generation of students. In addition, Viterbi students who participate in the program will be able to polish their own skills by mentoring younger students.
Isaaca Hoglen, a freshman majoring in biomedical engineering, said the program will be fulfilling because the work that participants put into it serves to benefit others.
“You’re not working with a professor to advance your knowledge, you’re helping other people advance their knowledge,” Hoglen said.
VAST will be launching a new social networking site to encourage students to form connections with one another, according to the statement.

Visitors young and old gathered Saturday at Doheny Memorial Library to attend the seventh-annual Los Angeles Archives Bazaar to learn more about the history of Los Angeles and Southern California.

The event, organized by L.A. as Subject — a historical research alliance — and USC Libraries, brought together researchers, journalists and curious onlookers fascinated by the history of this vibrant area.
Attendees participated in a series of panels hosted by experts with a passion for learning and disseminating information about the history of the area. They also got the chance to tour an exhibition hall filled with numerous organizations that house historical collections, such as USC Digital Libraries and the Los Angeles City Archives.
Carol Wells, founding director of the Center for the Study of Political Graphics, discussed the importance posters have in depicting history by capturing moments at a point in time at the panel “CSI Los Angeles: Archival Case Study Investigations.”
“In collecting these posters, we try to collect the stories behind them … each one tells a story,” Wells said.
She showed off a series of posters from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s that recall historical moments during these critical time periods, including some events that few people today even know existed.
A poster produced by the Black Panther Party, for instance, reveals how the political party, which many people consider separatist in nature, actually acted in collaboration with the Latino community during the 1970s.
Wells also noted that the growth of local print shops, which rivaled commercial shops, mushroomed during the 1960s and 1970s because commercial shops were loath to print politically radical posters.
“Local print shops in different cities started because you couldn’t get commercial print shops to print [politically inciting] posters,” she said.
Bailey Wilson, a senior majoring in narrative studies, said that the most interesting thing she learned from “CSI Los Angeles” was how posters reveal the extent to which white supremacy was grounded in the L.A. area in the 1960s and 1970s.
“I did not know that Southern California was such an epicenter for white supremacy, and I was shocked,” Wilson said. “I’m used to California being a much more open, liberal state in general.”
In addition to “CSI Los Angeles,” the event also featured a panel discussion about how Los Angeles became the worldwide center for car culture, thanks to drag races, drive-thrus and the 405 Freeway.
Nancy Fann, a junior majoring in chemical engineering, said she came to the Bazaar because she feels there is never too much to  learn about history.
“On my own, I think I have quite an extensive [amount of knowledge about] L.A. history, amongst my peers, but I wouldn’t say I know as much as I should or as much as I want,” Fann said.
Though Fann noted that the Bazaar was “the perfect place” to learn about Southern Californian history, she wished more emphasis had been placed on a subject that fascinates her — architecture.
“[Old architecture] is one of the things that gets overlooked a lot,” Fann said. “Most people associate cities with more modern skylines, which personally for me are kind of boring. Some of the older buildings — they put in a lot more thought, a lot more creative energy.”
Wilson remarked how history is such a multifaceted subject.
“I would like to know some other ways in which they’re uncovering history and unraveling different things,” Wilson said. “[Wells] talked about how she learned through posters … but there’s more that history books can’t teach you.”

Most Californians favor strong law enforcement policies against illegal immigration but are willing to make exceptions for children who came to the United States illegally, according to the latest USC Dornsife / Los Angeles Times poll, released Sunday.
The poll shows that most California voters support the DREAM Act, the law that allows certain undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to receive temporary or permanent residency if they have completed a certain amount of education or military service. About 69 percent of voters surveyed said they favor the policy, and 24 percent said they opposed it. The policy found even greater support among Latino voters: 84 percent said they support the DREAM Act.
Despite Californians’ sympathy for DREAM-ers, voters still showed strong support for a tough law enforcement crackdown on illegal immigration. Sixty percent of voters said they would like to see stronger National Guard troop presence on the border. Only 29 percent of voters said they would oppose an increased presence.
Similarly, many respondents said they do not think illegal immigrants should receive taxpayer-funded social services such as non-emergency health care and public education. Forty-six percent of voters said they would like to restrict these services to legal residents only while 44 percent said they would allow illegal immigrants to use these services.

In 1959, when Glenn Dicterow was just an 11-year-old boy, he made his solo debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.
Now, after spending more than 30 years as concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, Dicterow has made the decision to join the USC Thornton School of Music faculty.
And though Dicterow will not start teaching full time until 2013, he spoke Friday at the USC Fisher Museum of Art along with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Tim Page about the relationship between artists and critics and a multitude of subjects regarding orchestra — ranging from the way the conductor flails his arms to the best concert halls in the world.
Though he received his first critique when he was 10 years old, Dicterow still “waits for those reviews.”
“I used to get up early and check,” he said. “But now at midnight I can check on the Internet to see what they wrote about me.”
As a soloist, Dicterow said he sometimes feels as if critics “dispatch the solo.” He said that someone will do an amazing 15-minute solo, but the critics won’t even mention it.
Page, who refers to himself as a “recovering music critic,” explained that sometimes the New York Philharmonic’s critiques might be tougher because they’re the most familiar to New York writers.
“You are in New York week after week,” Page explained to Dicterow. “Berlin comes in [to New York] and does their best show. L.A. comes in and does their best show. And Vienna comes in and does their best show.”
Other orchestras go to New York with their very best program. And sometimes, as Dicterow explained, his orchestra will play three concerts a week.
Dicterow also said the venue of the concert affects the sound quality.
“We play at Carnegie four or five times a year,” Dicterow said. “And when we do, we sound like a different orchestra.”
The conversation between the two suited gentlemen then turned into a discussion about the best and worst concert halls. They compared European versus American, big versus small and modern versus ancient.
After Dicterow settled on the concert halls he liked (which included a small one in Vienna and the Walt Disney Concert Hall), the two moved on to discuss conductors.
According to Page and Dicterow, conductors’ styles range from crazy motions that look like bank tellers making change to small motions where they barely move their fingers.
“It can be very physical,” Dicterow said. “But it’s something magical. I cannot describe what happens. And it’s not always how much you conduct but how little you conduct.”
Each conductor is vastly different from other conductors, he said. From their attitudes to techniques, every one has their own style.
“Conductors are stubborn and that’s why they’re conductors,” Dicterow said.
Dicterow also described how his duties as a concertmaster differ from that of a musician.
“You have to be a chameleon,” he said, drawing on the fact that conductors have to adapt to different situations.
A room full of eager musicians — some holding their massive instruments at their feet — clamored to ask questions of the speakers, such as career advice for an audition.
“The music directors want creativity and control,” Dicterow said. “They want someone who contributes, but doesn’t stand out and still enhances. Know the orchestra, know how they play and fit in.”
Switching to the subject of criticism, Page said he thinks the role of the critic has become tamer over the years.
Critics, according to Page, are aware that they are often the only person covering the premiere of a brand or new work, and thus, they want to be careful about “putting down something someone’s been working on for a long time.”
Similarly, Page said critics must be careful to address each piece of work, even if the review is not necessarily positive.
“Nothing upsets a filmmaker, a dancer or a musician more than getting no review,” Page said. “They’d rather have a bad review than no review at all.”
Regarding his side of the critiquing process, Page said every critic has received “one of those ‘obviously we were not at the same concert last night’” comments. He said this could often be credited to the difference in experience between the critic and the members of the audience.
For the critic, “it’s a very familiar piece, we’ve heard it a lot,” Page said. “Whereas you, who I imagine is still on the sunny side of 30, has not seen it so much. The test for the critic is to try to keep some enthusiasm left for some pieces.”
Jordan Koransky, who had Page as a professor for a class in spring 2012, said that he came to the presentation because he “always loves to hear [Page] speak.”
Also a violin player, Koransky said that he is a huge admirer of Dicterow.
“It’s great to hear about inside stories about the older generation of musicians and the great conductors and performers they worked with,” Koransky said.
Nathan Johnson, a graduate student at the Thornton School of Music, said he had a general interest in what Dicterow had to say about his life and his experiences with the New York Philharmonic.
“He said that the conductors are now collaborating with the musicians,” Johnson said. “It’s good to hear him say that that’s true at such a high level because that’s similar to what I’m experiencing now.”

Dream Bar Cookies
Noah Cherner, an undeclared freshman, is particularly excited to enjoy his favorite Halloween dessert this year— Dream Bar Cookies. The cookies are a longtime family recipe, passed down by his mom.
“You can really have these anytime of the year and be happy, but there’s something about the subtle graham cracker taste that make this dessert so seasonal and fun,” Cherner says.
Ingredients:
-5 oz. Butter
-1/4 tsp. cinnamon
-1/2 tsp. salt
-9 oz. graham cracker crumbs

-Pour the condensed milk over everything.
-Place the whole pecans in neat rows rounded side up.
-Bake for 10 minutes.
Gently press pecans into chocolate and bake again for 10 minutes. Done when the condensed milk starts to gently bubble and the edges are just golden.
 
Tootsie Roll Ball
Ehren Elder, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, has a more unconventional recipe up his sleeve for Halloween this year.
“Ever since I was little, my family and I would stick together melted Tootsie Rolls and combine it all into a giant ball,” Elder says. “It’s really fun to do, and actually tastes great.”
Ingredients:
-As many Tootsie Rolls as one can find
Instructions:
-Wait for Tootsie Rolls to become slightly melted.
-Mash them together to make a huge ball.
Other students take a more relaxed approach to Halloween desserts.
“I tend to buy prepackaged cookie dough so I don’t actually have to really bake that much,” said Alex Coco, a freshman majoring in aeronautical engineering. “Although I do still like to decorate the cookies afterward for fun.”
Some people, however, choose not to exercise their creativity at all in the baking field.
“I buy candy from my local grocery store,” said Chris Bell, a freshman majoring in biology.
Erik Thomas, a freshman majoring in business administration, keeps it even simpler.
“I’ll just go pick up a decorated cupcake at EVK,” he said.
Innovative or not, USC students are prepared to get snacking this season; make sure to join in and spend the year’s spookiest holiday enjoying these aforementioned sugary delights.

Halloween: the holiday that involves sugar binges and discovering ways to scare yourself and others. It is also one of those rare holidays that’s meaning changes with age. Much like Valentine’s Day, where we went from trading cartoon valentines to our kindergarten classmates to offering roses and chocolates to our college sweethearts, the spooky festivities in which we partake drastically change over the years.
Whereas Halloween used to be an opportunity to wear a kickass Power Rangers costume and eat so many candy bars you wanted to hurl, it’s now a sprawling two-to-three-weekend extravaganza filled with drunken excuses to wear a sexy costume.
Costumes are arguably one of the most important components of Halloween. When else can you dress up like someone completely different and get away with it? Unless, of course, you’re an actor. Or a mascot. Or you work at Disneyland.
The art of choosing a costume differs depending on whether you’re a guy or a girl. It boils down to the fact that guys and girls have different aesthetic objectives when dressing up for the night. Girls want to look their best, accentuating all of their assets, while guys normally aim for humor or capitalize on the chance to show off their abs.
On second thought, maybe guys and girls aren’t so different in how they pick a costume. Halloween is a social holiday and, as a result, people use it as an excuse to impress others. A flattering costume will do just that, and maybe more.
The psychology behind costume selection on this most hallowed of nights is intricate. Essentially, a costume represents the self that we hesitate to portray to the world, the side of our identity that on any other day we’re afraid to display. It’s a better, more eye-catching version of ourselves that is only allowed an annual appearance — which means you have to make the most of it while it lasts.
Whether this means bringing out your inner deviant or buying a monster mask, Halloween is a chance to break free from the constraints of everyday life.
Here lies the allure that keeps us interested in a holiday that has become so heavily commercialized. Possibility awaits behind every mask and under each disguise. At the end of the night, it remains up to us who we decide to reveal ourselves to, one way or another.
The last night of October is when the socially constructed wall between morality and immorality crumbles. As the ever-insightful film Mean Girls points out, “In girl world, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything about it.” It’s a tried-and-true tradition of Halloween that girls assemble the skimpiest of costume ideas just for the sake of showing skin.
Nobody wants to be a Cady Heron and show up at the party in a scary costume. Who does that? As children, Halloween represented innocent fear. As adults, there are distinct sexual undertones to this night of debauchery.
Even male costumes are starting to get in on the scantily clad fun. This is especially evident in niche neighborhoods such as West Hollywood, but school parties are also catching up with the latest trend that every costume becomes sexualized.
In addition to the morbidly erotic element to Halloween, there’s also an inherent pressure to be clever and daring. Everyone has seen the bedsheet ghost getup, as well as the sexy French maid or a police officer.
Nowadays, people expect more from each other. A costume has to break the mold and make others think a little bit before instantly recognizing it. This delicate balance depends on whether your idea is witty enough to elicit a laugh but not so obscure that others give up trying to understand.
Irony reigns as king on Halloween; the more ironic your costume, the better suited it is for the critical eyes of our generation. This doesn’t mean throwing on some plaid and thick-framed glasses and calling yourself a hipster. Instead, think of it this way: Nobody actually wants to be Honey Boo Boo or Mitt Romney, but if you dress up as one of these two for the sake of irony, you’re bound to be a hit.
Halloween is not an effortless holiday. Finding an outfit and party planning (or even just finding a good party) require social prowess and a sharp sense of humor, not to mention natural sex appeal to complement those costumes.
It almost makes you yearn for the Halloweens gone by, when all you had to do was buy a pre-made costume from a plastic bag and say trick or treat at every door, doesn’t it?

Traditionally, independent filmmakers are restricted to films small in scope because of the limitations of a minimal budget. Indie projects with financing upwards of a few million dollars are considered highly abnormal.

Therefore when three directors — Lana and Andy Wachowski and Tom Tykwer — combine talents and collect more than $100 million, the film industry takes notice. Adapted from the renowned British novel by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas combines elements of almost every genre imaginable, including romance, science fiction, farce comedy and apocalyptic disaster. The film’s synopsis is not easily described — the novel and film can best be visualized as a looped tapestry of six narratives, all of which span the past, present and distant future literally and thematically.
Though the film begins in 1849 with the story of a lawyer at sea and ends in a post-apocalyptic future in 2346, the timeline of Cloud Atlas is achronological. The Wachowskis and Tykwer shuffle the stories into a structure that fluctuates both time and place while revealing connections between superficially disparate stories.
Once described as “un-filmable” by its author, the stories of Cloud Atlas are not only ambitious in structure, but in metaphorical purpose as well. The film deals with grand ideologies, including the desire for freedom, the strength of love and the destruction of oppression. Since the combined storyline encompasses such a large portion of time — nearly 500 years — the directing trio had to develop a mechanism for compressing the collective plot while still retaining the links between stories.
Cleverly, Tykwer and the Wachowskis use actors in multiple roles throughout the six stories to help connect the film’s thematic associations.
The three filmmakers have assembled an interesting cast of actors, mixing high-profile stars like Halle Berry and Tom Hanks with talented character actors like Hugo Weaving and Jim Broadbent. So when dolling up these performers for filming, the makeup team faced a paradoxical task: maintaining the actors’ unique character personae while creating striking differences in appearance so parallels could be drawn between roles.
For the recognizable actors, this method successfully seams together the six anecdotes. The relatively unknown actors are harder to identify in multiple roles, however, thereby lessening the impact of those connections.
Still, Cloud Atlas is perhaps the most beautiful film released in quite a long time. Usually, films choose a single visual style and never deviate too far from that form, but  Cloud Atlas excellently incorporates multiple types of imagery. The film blends an intricately designed past with a cleverly constructed future: From the industrialized geometric architecture of futuristic Neo-Seoul to the beautiful vintage feel of Belgium during the 1930s, the intense detail of each world seems effective but effortless. And since each frame contains such a great amount of information, the viewer is never bored while watching the film.
Considering the film’s nearly three-hour run time, one might expect the audience to experience fatigue or exhaustion, but Cloud Atlas moves with such fluidity that what in actuality is fairly long feels appropriately concise. This smooth pacing is the result of three factors: the excellent visuals, strong acting and superb editing. The acting across the board is quite successful. Most actors maintain a strong onscreen presence throughout their stories while also adding a special depth to each role. This balance of consistency and versatility creates a single narrative arc, but also individual branches, each with their own payoffs.
Cloud Atlas’ method of playing time ends up being its strongest attribute. Tykwer and the Wachowskis allow each story an appropriate duration before cutting and jumping to another setting entirely. The directors capture the audience’s attention in one story and immediately cut to another, thereby forcing viewers to intelligently consider the stories through a juxtaposition of scenes. The entire film revolves around this principle and for the majority of the six narratives it works very well.
So if the visuals are magnificent, the acting strong and the editing seamless, why does the film fail to meet the lofty expectations placed upon it?
Mainly, Cloud Atlas falters because of the nature of the connection between the six tales. Though the transitions are seamless and easy to understand, the connection between the stories feels highly superficial, almost too obvious for the viewer’s sake. Rather than alluding to these links by metaphorical means, the directors employ a much more direct representation. This choice greatly weakens the emotional impact of the film’s multiple climaxes.
The post-apocalyptic story in the film also features a stylized, degenerative form of English quite difficult to understand. Consequently, with the dialogue’s apparent lack of purpose, the scenes inhabiting this world are puzzling and ineffective. It seems that this future fable is the culmination of every prior story and their respective themes. And because this particular story is challenging to comprehend, the film fails to bring the themes of the individual stories to one, cohesive climax.
Despite its deep flaws, however, Cloud Atlas is a marvel of cinematic experience. Though it might not be the groundbreaking, exceptional film many had hoped for, Tykwer and the Wachowskis succeed with their ambitious project. The sensation of watching this epic might not be perfect, but it forces its audience to question the complexities of their own lives.
