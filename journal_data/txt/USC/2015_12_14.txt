A typical Monday (by far my busiest school day) at East China Normal University goes a little something like this…
9:00 a.m.: Wake up, check all my social media apps and begin to look like a human.
So many Snapstories and new pictures on Instagram to check because of this time difference…there’s just not enough time.
9:30 a.m.: Head over to the cafeteria right across the dorms with my roommate Rachel for breakfast. Not much conversation occurs, as Rachel and I are always studying for our daily Chinese quizzes.
Hmm…should I be healthy and get fruit or should I get an oily pancake? OK, oily pancake it is. It’ll be my reward for doing well on this quiz.
9:55 a.m.: I take my seat in my five-person Chinese class and get ready for my daily vocab quiz.
10:50 a.m.: 休息 (xiu xi, also known as break time)
Bless.
11:00 a.m.: Resume Chinese class and attempt to make it through the last hour.
12:00 p.m.: Chinese class ends, and my friends and I either go out the front gates to grab a quick lunch (street food style) or to the on-campus Korean restaurant for an overpriced, mediocre meal.
What am I going to do when I get home and food this good isn’t $1?
12:55 p.m.: Head over to my “Issues in Chinese Society” class with my friend Sandra.
OK…so when’s the next break?
2:30 p.m.: Break time! Since all classes besides Chinese are in the Global Education Building, most people head to the CIEE floor to snack on Oreos, eat scary amounts of Skippy peanut butter and chat with Chinese teachers. While on the CIEE floor, we’re only allowed to speak Chinese. The teachers yell at us if they catch us speaking English.
So I’m just going to eat my Oreos and stand with this group of fluent Chinese speakers and pretend I understand everything they’re talking about with the Chinese teachers.
2:45 p.m.: Resume class.
3:50 p.m.: “Issues in Chinese Society” class ends.
But wait, there’s more.
4:00 p.m.: Go up a floor to my “Chinese Film” class with my friend Sandra. This class is truly the best class ever. We watch one movie a week and spend maybe five minutes discussing it.                              
Last week’s movie was kind of like a Chinese version of The Hangover. I hope we watch something similar.
6:30 p.m.: Class ends and I head over to the cafeteria with Sandra. Clearly, we spend a lot of time together.
7:15 p.m.: I finally return to my dorm room after being in class since 10 a.m.
Bless.
Just kidding, look at all this homework I have.
7:30 p.m.: I finally get to start my Chinese homework and begin studying for the next day’s vocab quiz.
9:00 p.m.: My friends and I do an hour-long Insanity workout in the hallway of the fifth floor, making fools of ourselves for everyone to see.
1:00 a.m.: I finish my homework and studying and finally get to go to bed.

Christmas music is something I live for and take very seriously. Every year, I anxiously wait until the clock hits 12 a.m. on Dec. 1 when it’s socially acceptable to play Christmas music. The only downside to the holiday is the actual waiting that you have to endure before the magical day. Christmas music helps to relieve some of that agony, and I’ve made a list of 12 Christmas songs to help get you through the last 12 days before the greatest holiday ever.
Day 12.  “Winter Wonderland” – Bing Crosby
This is it. The weather has dropped to freezing temperatures and, depending on where you are, a blanket of snow possibly covers everything you see. Even if you hate this weather, you can’t help but be impressed at the change of landscape and how much everything glistens when it’s covered in snow — if you’re on the East Coast, that is.
Day 11. “Jingle Bell Rock” – Bobby Helms
It’s only fitting that you get ready for the holidays by doing the jingle hop with Bobby Helms. I keep warm by moving to the bells in this song while jingling around the clock.
Day 10. “Happy Holiday/The Holiday Season” – Andy Williams
By now, other people have caught on to their surroundings and the Christmas joy has reached them too. The holiday season is the time when people seem happier than usual, and the abundant decorations are a sign that Christmas is coming. If only things could be this great all year long …
Day 9. “Last Christmas — Pudding Mix”  – Wham!
… But that usually isn’t the case. In fact, sometimes the holidays can be a bit of a letdown. Wham! knows the struggle of giving someone a Christmas gift they don’t want or appreciate, and this timeless cautionary tale will hopefully keep you from making the same mistake.
Day 8. “All I Want for Christmas Is You” – Mariah Carey
Mariah Carey reminds us that Christmas isn’t just about gifts; it’s about spending time with loved ones and being thankful that you get to cherish these moments together. But, having said that, gifts are really important too.
Day 7. “Christmas in Hollis” – Run DMC
Now that the hard work of deciding what you want for Christmas is over, Run DMC will help you celebrate by telling the tale of their best Christmas ever in their native neighborhood of Hollis.
Day 6. “Little Saint Nick” – The Beach Boys
The Beach Boys keep the party going by telling you how Santa has the need for speed in his lightning-fast hot-rod of a sleigh. He definitely needs all the speed he can get if he wants to leave gifts or coal at every house in the world before sunrise.
Day 5. “Christmas Time Is Here” – Vince Guaraldi Trio
Santa might like to take things fast, but it’s also important to slow things down — but not too slow. Everything about Christmas time is fantastic, and if you don’t slow down to appreciate it, it’ll pass you by before you know it.
Day 4. “Wonderful Christmastime” – Paul McCartney
Who better to enjoy this time of year than with Paul McCartney? He made a Christmas song that perfectly captures the simply wonderful time of being around friends and family during the holidays.
Day 3. “Sleigh Ride” – Johnny Mathis
Even though “Sleigh Ride” has an obscene amount of covers and variations, the Johnny Mathis version is the best in my opinion. Just as soothing as it is a song for a night filled with ice-skating, hot chocolate and (obviously) sleigh rides, this song is the go-to song to get anyone in the mood for holiday cheer.
Day 2. “Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer” (Dean Martin)
Two days. Two days away from the greatest holiday ever. Give thanks to the reindeer that single-handedly helps Santa each year with his bright nose, because without him, there probably wouldn’t be a Christmas — unless Santa puts some new headlights on his sleigh.
Day 1. “The Christmas Song (Merry Christmas To You)” (Nat King Cole)
Congratulations! You’ve made it to the most agonizing day of the year: Christmas Eve. Each grueling second seems to take twice as long, and your mind is only thinking about all those gifts that will be under the tree tomorrow. Not to worry, Nat King Cole is here to ease your pain with a Christmas song that everyone loves.
Hopefully, your wait won’t be too painstaking. You’ll be ripping open presents in no time. These songs will help with the wait, and remind you that it’s worth it. After all, it’s the most wonderful time of the year. Merry Christmas!
