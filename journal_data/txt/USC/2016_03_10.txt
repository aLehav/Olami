 
Midterm season is upon us. If you’re anything like me, you are staying up until 2 a.m. memorizing study guides, furiously typing essays and taking practice exams. At some point during this process, your stomach starts to growl. You can’t focus. You’re dying for a snack. Most of the time, you’re tempted to run down to Starbucks and order a sugary, carb-laden vanilla scone or lemon pound cake. Though these foods are satisfying in the moment, they can make it harder to focus and prevent you from getting a good night’s sleep. Below are some healthier snack options for your inevitable late-night cravings. 
Pistachios

If you’ve been following this blog, you might be seeing a trend by now: I really like the ’90s. And who can blame me? The ’90s were awesome — hair metal faded in favor of grunge, and bands started playing real instruments again. My personal favorite group from that era (and really one of my favorites of all time) is Alice in Chains.
Alice in Chains is a Seattle-based band who rose to prominence in 1990 with their bone-crunching hit, “Man in the Box,” which was featured on their debut album, Facelift. They quickly became associated with the grunge scene in Seattle, and in 1992, solidified themselves as grunge legends with the release of their sophomore effort, Dirt.
Dirt is certainly AIC’s magnum opus. It squashed any notion that Alice was nothing more than a band riding a popular trend, and established them as a bold and unique player in the changing landscape of alternative rock/metal. And so it is undoubtedly their most important work. However, in my humble opinion, it is not their best (as great as it is). That distinction falls upon Alice in Chains (a self-titled album), their third and final LP with late lead singer Layne Staley. Alice in Chains — affectionately called Tripod because of the three-legged dog featured on the album cover — is the band’s most brooding, complex and ultimately satisfying piece of work.
To give the album some context, in 1995, Layne Staley was battling a drug addiction that had turned from bad to worse. That same year, he formed a super-group, Mad Season, with other grunge stars who were also trying to get sober, in an effort to kick his heroin habit (That band went on to release one fantastic album, Above). His sobriety was short lived, and, despite an upwards of 13 visits to rehab, Layne only sunk further into addiction. In 1996, a year after Alice in Chains was released, Layne told Rolling Stone: “Drugs worked for me for years, and now they’re turning against me. I’m walking through hell.” (Staley would finally succumb to his addiction in 2002.)
Alice’s three other members were relatively clean, but were growing increasingly worried about Layne’s condition. These circumstances, in a tale of tragic irony, became the breeding ground for what would become a grunge masterpiece. Staley’s lyrics on Dirt were by no means cheery or pedestrian, but on Alice in Chains, his lyrics became even more personal and precise, and his poetic prowess grew. But it is important to understand that Staley’s lyrical themes on Alice in Chains are different than the themes on Dirt. Dirt shows us a man who is fighting desperately to gain control of himself over his demons. Alice in Chains delivers to us a man in resignation, someone not as much fighting as wading in guilt and frustration.
Along with this updated lyrical style comes strange, brooding harmonies featured on almost every song. Vocal harmony between Layne and guitarist Jerry Cantrell had been a staple of the band’s sound since its inception. But Layne provides us with something more ominous on Alice in Chains; each track seems to have at least seven vocal parts singing at once. Staley’s voice, though amazing as always, does not possess the raw and gritty power he displayed on past AIC efforts. But that’s not the vocal style Alice in Chains calls for. Instead, Staley delivers contorted, yet beautiful layers upon layers of piercing harmonies. It’s a vocal style I’ve yet to encounter in anything else.  
Guitarist Jerry Cantrell, chief songwriter of AIC, also altered his style, laying down heavier, sludgier and often gorgeously twisted melodies. For example, the strange, wailing lead heard with a wall of crunchy rhythm guitar on the chorus of “God Am” helps convey the anguish Layne expresses as he makes a sarcastic plea to the divine. The chorus gives you an overwhelming swelling in your gut — not many songs can do that.
Another notable sonic change is the abandoning of heavy reverb applied to Sean Kinney’s drum parts. Kinney’s drums are more poppy and precise than on past efforts, and they help make the record sound more intimate and inward-focused. Kinney also reminds us that he’s one of rock’s most underrated drummers with songs like “Shame in You,” where he keeps a steady, almost Jamaican-inspired groove that really rounds out the song’s instrumental nicely. “Shame in You” also features some of Staley’s most poignant lyrics and heartbreaking melodies. With lines like, “When I’m waking, and I’m aching/time for sleep in, yeah,” Staley puts us in his dope-sick world without being melodramatic or self-indulgent about his condition.
“Frogs” is the album’s best track, and perhaps the best song AIC has ever made. It is an eight-minute long epic about the loss of friendship, propelled as always by Staley’s unique lyrics and Cantrell’s muddied, brooding guitar work. Songs like “Frogs” are great reminders of why Alice in Chains (the band) is a cut above the rest. They are masters at turning pain into beauty. And they are able to do so without sounding whiny, overly dramatic or outright disturbing for the sake of being disturbing. This is not a balance many bands were able to strike (especially with the eventual rise of genres like Nu Metal at the end of the decade).
Alice in Chains is near the top of my all-time favorite albums list. I discovered it at the right time, when I was brimming with teenage angst. But even though that angst has gone, the album remains relevant and enjoyable, a testament to its enduring quality.

I can’t agree more! I am here for the same reasons as Katie; looking for new articles for my all time favourite band. Tripod is definitely underated and their more mature work indeed. And what I love about AIC the most is that there is not a single music genre that characterises them imo. They are AIC. Thank you for this article, you made my day.
Thank you Nima! I am a 57 year old AIC fan who raised my two kids (Andrew, 27 & Hannah, 22) on their haunting beautiful melodic hard rock music for the exact eloquent reasons you outlined in this wonderful review. I grew up on 70’s *Classic Rock*, and although I loved the B52’s (melody again), the 80’s didn’t do a whole lot for me… and hair metal, well… (meh). I loved the whole 90’s rock scene – from AIC, Soundgarden & the rest of the Seattle greats to STP & Days of The New. It was immediately different – more raw & emotion based music & lyrics. So now I pop on the web about once every two weeks to check up on any AIC related news as they are my favorite band of all time. I even love the new music (BGWTB 2009 & TDPDH 2013) and await their next effort. I just wanted to tell you that in the 26 years of loving this band, I’ve never read a more well-written review regarding Jer & guys which spoke precisely how I feel in my heart about Alice In Chains. Truly. Although you’ve been a member all along… Welcome to The AIC Family Tribe. Peace
Katie, thank you so much for your comment. Your reaction is exactly what I hope readers experience when reading these reviews. Always good to see fellow AIC fans — I still feel they and this album in particular are vastly underrated. I’m hoping they release new material soon.
Thank you again for your kind words, and hopefully you’ll enjoy future reviews!

The USC Sports Business Institute hosted Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred on Wednesday for a discussion about the key accomplishments of and challenges for the MLB to date, while also providing insight into the direction of America’s pastime in the years to come. 
The event, which took place at L.A. Live was part of the institute’s ongoing Commissioners’ Series and was moderated by David Carter, executive director of the Sports Business Institute and an associate professor in the Marshall School of Business.
Manfred has served in his capacity for a little over a year after stepping into the  role of the MLB’s 10th Commissioner on January 15, 2015. He was elected by a unanimous vote of the 30 Major League clubs in August 2014. Prior to succeeding long-time Commissioner Bud Selig, Manfred worked as the league’s Chief Operating Officer, where he oversaw labor relations, baseball operations and development, and finance, among other principal areas. 
“I think having been with the league for 20 years, he knows his way around the domestic issues and the opportunities internationally,” Carter said.
Manfred began by elaborating on his transition to becoming the league’s top executive and how heads of various other major domestic leagues aided him in that process.
“No one was more helpful to me in the transition process than [NBA Commissioner] Adam Silver,” Manfred said. 
He said that the commissioners talk about areas of mutual interest on a frequent basis, notably National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman, due to the business relationship that the two leagues have. Last August, MLB Advanced Media purchased the rights to all of the NHL’s digital platforms in a groundbreaking partnership that was worth approximately $600 million over a six-year period. 
A former lawyer, the 57-year old New York native spoke at length about how the league is trying to appeal to a younger demographic. With over 75 million tickets being sold every year, he praised the efforts of the 30 major league clubs to attract a younger audience by tailoring the overall ballpark experience to their tastes. 
“We do have a younger fan base, but I think the issue is how we deliver our product in a way that is acceptable to them in consuming the product,” Manfred said. 
Manfred believes that the “trip” with younger people is technology and the MLB, along with its Advanced Media arm, is hoping to ensure that baseball is available on platforms that the younger audiences will generally go to as a primary source of information. He added that the league would be rolling out a new partnership with Snapchat this upcoming season. 
The commissioner also touched on an issue close to home, in which many Los Angeles Dodgers fans are still blacked out from watching Dodgers games, due to the inability for Time Warner Cable to come to a mutual agreement with many of the other local distributors. Manfred said that the league has talked to the parties involved to try to encourage them to  achieve a resolution, but also that he doesn’t have much leverage in those negotiations. 
“The club doesn’t really have a seat at that table and we’re at least one removed from the club,” Manfred said. 
A major focus this year for the league, according to Manfred, is labor relations. He briefly touched on the their upcoming negotiations with the MLB Players Association for a new collective bargaining agreement when the current one expires on Dec. 1. Manfred guided the renewals of the agreement in 2002, 2006 and 2011. The 2002 labor pact was the first in over 30 years that was settled without incurring a work stoppage. 
“We’ve had 20 years of labor peace and I have confidence that we will be able to come to an agreement,” Manfred said. 
Other topics Manfred tackled later in the talk included the expanding role of daily  fantasy baseball, which he said isn’t going anywhere. In addition, he touched on the subject of diversity and how the MLB is attempting to branch out to other international markets like China, Mexico and Cuba. 
“It’s important that our product be diverse,” Manfred said. “Compared to any other major professional sport in North America , we are by far the most diverse sport.” 
Overall, the conversation was well received by the 300 or so professionals, alumni and students at the event.
“Our goal is to make sure we have a really solid, topical discussion, maybe not going really deep on any one topic, but dotting the landscape on things the audience would be interested in hearing about,” Carter said. 
USC students were also impressed with Manfred’s ability to delve into so many different themes, such as diversity, youth participation and international development.  
“It was clear that Commissioner Manfred has had a tremendous impact on the game of baseball already and I’m excited to see how the league grows in the future with him at the helm,” junior business administration major Schuyler Corbin said.
Commissioner Manfred’s visit marks the SBI’s ninth Commissioners’ Series event, which is dedicated to hosting the leaders of America’s premier sports leagues and organizations.
“It speaks volume to the strength of the Marshall School and USC when a commissioner will come out on his own dime, on his own time and spend some time with us,” Carter said.

Amid a national conversation on college affordability, and a recently proposed tuition hike here at USC, I feel it’s imperative to discuss the value of my education over the past four years. 
My courses at USC have undoubtedly given me skills to not only to put on my resume, but also to use for the career I’ll start after graduation. My professors and mentors have provided me both career and life advice. My friends have made me feel safe and at home at a school that’s 2,800 miles away from my family. These life-changing benefits, however, came at a very high price, one that I know I’m incredibly lucky to have been able to afford. 
The fact that USC, and many other universities across the nation come with a price tag that an increasing number of Americans don’t have the means to pay, is an injustice. I’ve racked my brain for an answer to this problem, and I don’t readily have a solution to solve the price tag predicament of higher education in the United States. 
University employees must be paid, buildings must be renovated, lights must be kept on in dormitories across campus, all while students demand more resources like increased counseling services and transportation subsidized by the school. There is no easy way to solve this problem. 
Some point to financial aid — citing the two-thirds of USC freshmen that are able to attend the University thanks to financial assistance from the school. But what about the students who were too intimidated by the $200,000-plus cost of an undiscounted four-year college experience, and didn’t get the chance to ask about ways to subsidize tuition before they wrote off the possibility? Regardless of financial aid opportunities, the sticker price of universities across the nation must be brought down.
This week I spoke to a prospective student who, after visiting campus the day of the Tuition Hike Rally and sit-in outside president Nikias’ office, decided he didn’t want to come to USC anymore. The high school senior told me he comes from a family of immigrants, and already working himself, was concerned he wouldn’t be able to afford college. He had just left the Financial Aid Office where he was told that there were certainly ways that he could afford the university. After stumbling upon the rally, he wasn’t sure so sure. 
“I saw the school as just a godly thing and to see this injustice, it was just wild,” the student, who wished to remain anonymous said.  “I was in shock and disappointed and scared and sad all at once.”
My four years of college have not been perfect, but they are something all Americans deserve to experience. Even when lights were cast on USC’s flaws — when I sat in large lecture halls learning facts about geology that I’m sure I’ll never use again, when I reported on incidents of racism on campus, or when I felt personally underserved, such as when being told to wait weeks to see an available counselor at the health center — I continued to place a high value on a four-year college education. 
Society favors those with degrees, too. College grads are more likely to have lower unemployment and poverty rates and be happier with their careers, according to Pew Research Center. Increased access to higher education is sure to lessen the wealth gap that plagues our nation, and it’s crucial that we find a way for more young people to attain a college degree. 
As I come up on the two-month mark until graduation day, I know that the last four years have been the most valuable four years of my life so far.
