Following the surge of anti-Asian sentiment since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the USC Annenberg Cross-Cultural Student Association and the USC chapter of the Asian American Journalists Association hosted a virtual event Thursday. The event, “Pandemic Panic: The surging violence against Asian Americans” came after Tuesday’s racially motivated shooting of eight people — six identifying as women of Asian descent —in Atlanta, Ga., and shed light on the racist issues that Asians and Pacific Islanders encounter in their daily lives.
Throughout the pandemic, over 3,500 anti-Asian hate incidents, mostly against women, were reported in the United States, according to NBC News. Asian Americans throughout the nation have experienced verbal harassment, shunning and physical assault. 
Panelists Anh Do, Joyce Jang, Jon Funabiki, Dr. Sherry Wang and Christina Yang weighed in their professional perspectives on the importance of addressing racism amongst API victims for an audience of over 150 people. 
Wang, an associate professor at Santa Clarita University in the department of counseling psychology, first dove into the idea that AAPI individuals are isolated from Black and Indigenous  communities and communities of color because of the model minority stereotype. 
“The model minority myth that we are high achieving, that we’re excelling, that it’s a better cultural trait and something that we’re inherently born with — all of which are false, it’s a very colorblind narrative,” Wang said. “When we experience racism, we don’t get the same kind of empathy or even the same kind of listening space … When we do speak up about it, we experience gaslighting.” 
Wang said anti-Asian sentiments are “very American” because of the nation’s history of scapegoating Asians, something that has also been seen throughout the pandemic.
“When something is happening in China, or when there is competition with China, it comes back to hurt Americans who are Chinese. It [also] hurts Americans who appear Chinese,” Wang said.
According to Insider, with people such as former president Donald Trump calling the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus” or the “Kung Flu,” racial insensitivity has promoted a lot of racial tension throughout the nation. 
Panelists also discussed the shooting of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, in Atlanta Tuesday. Jang, co-president of the USC Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment, discussed the complexity behind the spa shooting. She said that the shooting was a story about race, gender, fetishization, misogyny, economic exploitation, poverty, colonialism and erasure.  
“We need to address that these identities are intersectional, and that, especially regarding Asian women, the U.S. has a history of sexualizing [and] trafficking Asian women during wars, and that trauma from our mothers, our grandmothers, our great grandmothers, can be seen now, and also the attitudes that Americans have towards Asian women really stem from the larger systemic issues that America has,” Jang said. 
With the shooting tragedy in mind, the panelists talked about the necessity for current and future journalists to listen to people’s stories, report on them with compassion and build relationships with communities. 
“Journalists kind of respond to the next disaster and the next crisis, and then they start to forget, and then the next one happens. What I hope is that journalists will put more time into what they do between the crisis. That’s where it’s [going to] make a difference,” said Funabiki, a retired San Francisco State University journalism professor. “[Media outlets] can start to build these relationships with the community. They can hire more Asian American journalists. They can do more stories about Asian American lives, communities and the real lived experiences, and not simply responding — jump from one crisis to another.”
Funabiki also explained that journalists have a certain duty to the communities they report on. 
“We are bound together by these social injustices, and journalists need to accept that responsibility and need to do the kind of coverage that can promote progress,” Funabiki said.
Nathan Hyun, a junior majoring in journalism, moderated the event. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, he said he hopes to bring awareness to the USC community about the issues API individuals currently experience and how they are trying to move forward as a collective unit.
“It’s really important to [care] for others. [It] doesn’t matter if you’re Black, white, Asian … Being understanding of what people are going through and really caring about how people identify themselves and where they’re from — I think more than anything it’s so important to think about that and take that into consideration in everything I do,” Hyun said. “I’m still growing; I’m still learning. I’m still in college but hearing from these outside perspectives tonight was definitely eye opening for me. So I hope in the future, I can definitely be someone who helps others.”
The panel also discussed a possible reason behind the lack of media coverage on marginalized communities is the different levels of diversity in certain communities. 
Anh Do, a metro reporter for the Los Angeles Times, said Latinos make up the largest population in L.A. County, so there is a special group of reporters covering Latino issues in the L.A. Times. 
“We have quite a number of Asian American reporters at the paper, but instead of being assigned a specialty diversity, it turned out that they’re assigned to cover issues like the environment or earthquakes or coronavirus vaccinations, things like that,” Do said.
Asian Americans, who the panelists discussed as being invisible and overlooked due to the model minority stereotype and scapegoating they experienced throughout U.S. history, have trouble finding allies who can tackle the flaws in society’s system in solidarity with other communities.
“If it has been new for you, that Asian Americans experience racism, then you really haven’t been a safe person for Asian Americans,” Wang said.“You haven’t been someone that Asian Americans have been able to confide [in], in terms of what their experiences have been, as Asian Americans.”

Women are defying the odds and overcoming challenges no matter where they go. According to the U.S. Labor Department, fewer than 20% of working chefs are women and women comprise only 7% of head chefs and restaurateurs around the U.S. 
The food industry and restaurant business has often been historically male dominated, but women are making a difference and changing a kitchen culture which has, in the past, been toxic and abusive. 
For Women’s History Month and after, here are a few must-try trendy Los Angeles-based and women-owned eateries that should be on everyone’s lists: 
A trendy L.A. cafe situated in Silver Lake, chances are you’ve seen the pre-pandemic long lines extending beyond the cozy eatery or heard about the farm-to-table innovative dishes the cafe  is known for. Chef Jessica Koslow started Sqirl as a preserves company in 2011 before expanding to serve breakfast and lunch. The eatery has been featured in lists such as the 2014 Jonathan Gold’s 101 Best Restaurant List, Grubstreet’s 103 Most Visually Exciting Dishes in America in 2015 and Eater’s 2014 Best Chef in L.A.
With options a little on the pricey side, I decided to order the avocado toast with a fried egg, a gluten free almond ricotta cake and a cocoa buzz, an iced espresso concoction with bee energy honey, Valrhona chocolate, cinnamon and oat milk. The avocado toast was a little different from your average dish and came topped with spiralized pickled beets, smoked sesame tahini and house za’atar. It almost looked too good to eat with the bright yellow beets and red spices adding vivid color to the dish, that I had to double check to make sure I had gotten the right order. The dish itself was fresh and flavorful and I really liked the addition of smoked tahini to the avocado for a zingy taste. 
The ricotta cake was my personal favorite with its soft lemony moist sweetness and with my sweet tooth, I devoured the entire thing in one sitting. The coffee was a strong blend of sweet flavors and while not usually a big fan of cinnamon, I thought the Valrhona chocolate and cinnamon worked really well together. The fried egg was a little undercooked for my preference but overall was enjoyable with the toast.
Sqirl is now open for outdoor dining and takeout via Postmates.      
Started by chefs Sara Kramer and Sarah Hymanson, the Middle Eastern meets Californian cuisine has quickly found fans in L.A. The powerful duo has made a name for themselves as women chefs as the restaurant has been featured in the Michelin Guide, won various James Beard awards and included in a variety of food lists. Located in Los Feliz, “Kismet is a neighborhood spot for everyone.”
I decided to order from Kismet Rotisserie and try their quarter chicken plate and schmaltzy potatoes. The generous serving of chicken plate came with a choice between dark or light chicken and sides of hummus, wedge salad, pickles, garlic sauce, chilli oil and pita. The chicken was perfectly cooked with crispy brown skin and paired well with hummus and garlic sauce. The hummus was freshly prepared and my only complaint was that I finished it too quickly to have enough for the rest of the chicken. The pita was my favorite part and served as a great accompaniment to the hummus. 
The schmaltzy potatoes were crispy potatoes, tossed with toasted garlic and chicken drippings. While not my favorite potato side dish, I liked the texture and garlic flavor and ate them with a garlic roasted hummus dip for even more flavor.
Kismet is currently open for takeout and delivery via DoorDash and Caviar.    
What started as owner Amanda Chantal Bacon’s experience of resolving an autoimmune condition through life and dietary changes, has now evolved into a place for everything ranging from health elixirs, juices, smoothies and skin care products. With stores in Venice, Melrose and Silver Lake, Moon Juice was established in 2011 when wellness diets and health foods were not as popular as they are today. Bacon received criticism for her lifestyle, and dealt with satire about her brand, before turning it into three storefronts, a booming online business and a lifestyle.
While not a believer in health foods and juice cleanses, I decided to see what the hype was about by ordering a Keto Blue Mint Chip shake. Made with almond coconut milk, blue spirulina, frozen avocado, peppermint and cacao nibs, the blue-color drink was very aesthetically pleasing and came in a plastic cup with the words “cosmic in a cup.” The frozen avocado added to the creaminess of the drink and with it’s mint and chocolate flavor it was a refreshing way to start my Sunday afternoon.
Moon Juice is currently open for takeout and delivery via Postmates, GrubHub, Seamless, Doordash, Uber Eats and Caviar.  
A to-go-only joint even before the restrictions of the coronavirus, this dimsum place on the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Bronson Avenue is a mom-and-pop store known for its reasonably priced, authentic dimsums. It is owned by Gloria Shi, who is helped by her 71-year-old father Tony Ying; three generations of the family have operated Chinese restaurants in the past. Shi has grown up around the food business and gained experience at 12 years old hostessing for her father’s restaurant. 
I ordered the chicken, cabbage and mushroom pan fried dumplings, chow mein and pineapple polo custard bao. The dumplings were freshly made and perfectly pan fried with a juicy and crispy skin to match the delicious filling inside. The chow mein was topped with veggies and healthy with a salad-like taste that made you feel less guilty about the dumplings. The pineapple polo custard bao was flaky and melted in your mouth. It had a strong pineapple flavor and custard filling inside that was well-balanced and not overly sweet. 
Ixlb is currently available for takeout and delivery via Postmates and ChowNow. 
Bringing authentic Italian food all the way from Padova, Northern Italy, Pasta Sisters is the story of Paola Da Re who grew up cooking with her mother before moving to L.A. where she runs the restaurant with her daughter and son. The restaurant is known for its affordable pasta that includes homemade gnocchi from a recipe that has been passed along the family for over a 100 years. From being included in BuzzFeed’s “Worth it,” (where it was considered worthy) the eatery had to quickly expand to Culver City due to its growing popularity. Pasta Sisters continues to be included in multiple L.A. best restaurants food lists. 
I decided to try their fresh truffle pasta made with Tagliatelle with chilli flakes on the side. The dish also came with some homemade bread which I appreciated. The pasta itself was buttery with a great truffle balance so as not to be overwhelming in its flavor. The Tagliatelle was firm but light and absorbed the truffle sauce very well. I was really impressed with the dish and how well it travelled and I’m already planning what to get the next time I order.
Pasta Sisters is currently open for takeout and delivery via Postmates.

When business owner Paul Tavenner received an email from the mayor’s office, he thought it was spam or phishing. It looked too good to be true. For 21 years, Tavenner has been promoting his business primarily through word of mouth. Then the pandemic hit the globe; everything changed and Taverner decided to take the leap and replied to the email. 
Since then, Tavenner’s music studio has joined LA Optimized, which recruits local small businesses who have been struggling during the pandemic. USC Iovine and Young Academy associate professors Manos Matthew, Steve Child, Davina Wolter and Grant Delgatty are part of the creative advisory board that brings business owners together with creative professionals, such as graphic designers, photographers, copywriters and filmmakers, to maximize online presence. Creatives willing to participate will earn a $500 grant for their services. 
Announced in late-November, LA Optimized aims to help brick and mortar shops create or improve business listings and websites and to perform e-commerce audits. To qualify, a business must prove a less than $5 million income per fiscal year. 
“From my perspective, during the pandemic, one of the other things that we saw is that larger businesses were hit as well, but they were able to put their abundant resources to good use in order to survive and in some cases thrive,” said Matthew, who leads as chair of the mayor’s creative advisory board. “However, small businesses who do lack the resources, the time, the spare cash, they start having to shutter their doors or severely kind of limit the amount of income that they’re able to make.” 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 163,000 businesses have closed, according to Yelp Economic Average. Although local professional and auto services were able to get by according to the report, restaurant and retail have struggled since the pandemic’s emergence.
“It’s tragic. These are people’s livelihoods,” Child said. “These are people who have started businesses that they’ve put their heart and souls and their passions into, and they may have just either started or haven’t gotten their footing yet, and then [the coronavirus] came around and stopped them right in their tracks.”
“I was really attracted to the idea, in general, being able to be a part of something that was going to support small businesses in Los Angeles,” Matthew said. “I’m really passionate about finding ways for the creative community to get involved in initiatives that can create impact on a community level while also being supported in doing that work.” 
Once the program accepts a business, they receive access to a website that lists what the creative professionals have to offer, Matthew said. Services range from reviewing portfolios to designing a new logo. Creatives may also suggest new packaging, product design or signage for physical stores, website design or social media with new photography and promotional video clips. 
The LA Optimized program also partners with Matthew’s company verynice to deliver up to $500,000 in total to creative professionals to help local businesses thrive by maximizing communication with their consumers. Matthew said he was inspired to pursue such an endeavor because of the pandemic’s strike on under-resourced businesses. 
Once L.A. city gathers the grant money through fundraising, the ArtCenter College of Design will pay the creatives so that businesses don’t have to deal with payments, Matthew said. 
“[We’re] essentially ensuring that small businesses continue to thrive in the city of Los Angeles and beyond in that jobs remain stable and growing [and] any kind of issues around ensuring a strong economy for L.A.,” he said. 
Business owner of Big City Recording Studios Paul Tavenner recently began working with LA Optimized to support his music production studio which has been around for 21 years. The pandemic deprived him of all in-person sessions but Tavenner’s business remained afloat due to his pre-existing digital customers. 
With an outdated website, Tavenner’s first meeting with LA Optimized included discussing improvements to his social media sites, such as his Yelp, Google and Facebook pages, and creating an Instagram page. 
“I feel great about it because it really couldn’t have come at a better time,” Tavenner said. “Part of what LA Optimized wants to get out of this [is that] it’s to the benefit of the city. If my business does well, I pay more taxes, the city benefits from that.” 
Once a business builds up revenue, it is also possible to hire the creative who optimized their company, Tavenner said.
“If you’re going to help me build my business to the point where I could afford to hire you, that’s a no brainer. Why wouldn’t I?,” he said.
While LA Optimized is still in its early stages of recruiting, hundreds of local businesses like Tavenner’s are participating. Nearly 100 creatives that are looking to be considered or have been approved for a grant, Matthew said. 
The mayor’s office plans to support up to 1,000 small businesses in its first year of operation and allocate more than 1.5 million to help provide services, according to Garcetti’s press release. 
The program’s goal is to reach more small businesses, pandemic or not, Matthew said. Beyond continuing to grow the program, even following the pandemic, LA Optimized looks to diversify the services offered to small businesses, such as expanding to social media marketing, to maintain a healthy economy. 
“[There are] no words to describe how complicated things have been and how appreciative I am that these businesses have worked as hard as they have to try to persevere and to try to make it through a time like this,” Matthew said. “I do hope that what hopefully is a terrible 12-month-long memory doesn’t completely change their dreams and their ambitions and their passion for what they do for their communities.”

Marvel fanatics have, for years, been begging for more screen time for Captain America’s beloved sidekicks Falcon and the Winter Soldier. The pair’s witty banter and sheer hilarity enamored fans, but their continual lack of dialogue and attention constantly disappointed Marvel supporters. 
Marvel’s latest Disney+ show, “Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” attempts to appease its fans by giving the people what they want: more of Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan). 
The premise of the show is cute: two beloved action heroes coming together to save the world. In previous Marvel movies, the pair took on a fun buddy-cop vibe where they cracked jokes and had a playful rivalry, but came together when the moment mattered. 
However, the first episode of the highly anticipated Marvel production shows the two friends living completely separate lives. 
Audiences meet Falcon first — mid-mission and taking on an army of bad guys by himself. This introduction does its best to paint Falcon as a strong Avenger. Basically, it seems as though Marvel realized they had to make Falcon cooler and more powerful to open up a wider range of possible plotlines, and this scene is its way of establishing that. The unnecessary extravagance of the opening introduction is also reminiscent of typical Marvel fight scenes, immediately establishing “Falcon and the Winter Soldier” as a stereotypical Marvel production. 
The show also establishes a much-needed backstory for Falcon; the viewer learns that Falcon is a man who abandoned his family to join the armed forces but is now attempting to save his family’s fishing boat business from going under. Falcon’s backstory dives into the real-life consequences of the snap, showing how family relationships, particularly his own, were affected by the blip. His scenes are serious, and a departure from the comedic and sarcastic Falcon audiences are used to seeing. Albeit necessary to get audiences to connect with their new leading man, his backstory is shockingly normal and boring in comparison to that of other Marvel characters.  
These scenes are an obvious attempt at showcasing Falcon’s guilt for being “snapped away” by Thanos, and the poor writing makes some parts corny and cliche. Frankly, Falcon deserves better than this. 
After a drawn-out introduction to Falcon, the show immediately reintroduces the audience to the Winter Soldier. Unlike Falcon, the Winter Soldier does not need an introduction to establish his strength, as people can watch the Captain America movies to learn about that. Instead, audiences meet a free Bucky Barnes, no longer under Hydra’s control, attempting to assimilate in the United States while coping with grief and post-traumatic stress disorder. 
“Falcon and the Winter Soldier” tries to establish Barnes as a grief-stricken and solemn war veteran who tries to cope with over 70 years of guilt and trauma by befriending an elderly Japanese man and attending therapy. Although introduced as a serious character in “Captain America and the Winter Soldier,” Barnes’ recent arc has turned him into a funny superhero. “Falcon and the Winter Soldier” attempts to restore a somber version of this character.  
Winter Soldier’s reintroduction as a serious character is subpar at best: His serious scenes include weird close-ups on Stan’s face and odd camera angles meant to make conversations more emotional. However, these stylistic choices take serious subject matters and make them almost laughable because, frankly, it is funny to be staring at the character’s cheek for two minutes. 
In attempting to make Falcon and the Winter Soldier serious characters, the show shoots itself in the foot. Mackie and Stan are charming and charismatic actors, and that is what audiences know and love them as. Attempting to rewrite them as serious, angsty superheroes diminishes their likability.  
Although a show exploring our leads’ mental health could be insightful, it is not done well enough in “Falcon and the Winter Soldier” to seriously add any meaning. These emotions deserve more than a quick therapy visit or a flashback in a dream, and relegating them to subplots diminishes their emotional pull. After watching a show such as “WandaVision,” it is hard to see a Marvel character’s grief treated as a secondary plot, knowing how well Marvel can explore it if it wanted to. 
However, although the premiere episode faltered, there is still hope for this show. For one, the episode teases an intriguing villain that appears to be “an Avengers level threat.” For an opening episode that moves surprisingly slowly, it ends with a shocking plot twist that opens the door for a multitude of storylines. 
More importantly, glimpses of the funny and charismatic Falcon are sprinkled amongst his more serious scenes and moments of dry humor from the Winter Soldier remind audiences why we love these characters.  
Although the show is flawed, it’s necessary to keep in mind what it is meant for: pure fan service, done by Marvel, to appease its large legion of adoring supporters. It does that by giving fan-favorite heroes more screen time. The show is fun, and seeing these characters on our screens again is a bittersweet nostalgic throwback to pre-coronavirus times.
Despite all its initial problems, “Falcon and the Winter Soldier” has potential and deserves time to find itself. 
Rating: 3/5 stars

Just two days before tip-off, the No. 6 seeded Trojans now know who they will face in the first round of the NCAA tournament: the Drake Bulldogs. 
For the first time in four years head coach Andy Enfield and company will compete in the Big Dance. The team, heading straight to Indianapolis from the Pac-12 tournament in Las Vegas, had to prepare for two play-in opponents this week.
“It is a little unique in the tournament to prepare for two teams and only play one of them,” Enfield said. “But we also prepare in advance in case we win the game we have to play a second round game on short notice.”
The Bulldogs won over the Wichita State Shockers 53-52 in a scrappy First Four game. After a rocky start offensively, Drake finally came alive behind the arc to pull out the one point victory.
Sophomore guard Joseph Yesufu led the charge for Drake with 21 points, followed by redshirt-senior forward Tremell Murphy with 11. Yesufu is definitely a top contributor for the team, but look out for senior forward ShanQuan Hemphill to pose a powerful threat in the paint against USC.
The Trojans’ No. 6 seed is the highest bid Enfield has received during his coaching tenure at USC. After a promising 2020 season with high postseason potential cut short due to the coronavirus, the program reinvented itself with a slate of transfers including redshirt senior guard Tahj Eaddy and the addition of lottery-pick talent in freshman forward Evan Mobley. 
“[We’re] full of excitement, especially for our guys who returned from last season,” Eaddy said. “Unfortunately because of [the coronavirus] we weren’t able to participate in March Madness, so we’re just full of excitement.”
Eaddy is playing out his last year of eligibility and has been the veteran leader of a squad that rose to national prominence with a 22-7 season record. Starting the regular season strong in January then stumbling on the road in February, the Trojans’ road to March Madness hasn’t always been smooth.
The regular season ended in chaotic, March Madness-esque fashion when Colorado pulled out a 72-70 win over USC in the final seconds of the Pac-12 semifinals. While the game cut the program’s chance of bringing home a conference title, Mobley asserted himself as a force to be reckoned with.
Recently named a second-team All-American, the freshman put up a career-high 26 points against Utah in the Pac-12 tournament’s first game and proceeded to match it against the Buffs the following day. Amassing five blocks and nine rebounds on top of his scoring total, Mobley set the tone for his postseason mindset.
“I just know it’s a big stage and big players have to step up to the challenge,” Mobley said. “So I just try to step up to the challenge and do everything I possibly could to help our team win.”
Saturday’s game likely marks the beginning of the end for Mobley, but the freshman only looks to the future and takes each game at a time.
“I just try to focus on what’s in front of me and not focus too much into the future,” Mobley said. “I just try to do what I do on the court to the best of my ability every night.”
Enfield’s coaching staff must also consider a prospective second-round matchup against No. 3 Kansas in the event that USC defeats Drake. Kansas is currently the favored potential matchup. 
However, Enfield is confident in the strengths that brought USC to their best season in over a decade. 
“You have to focus on yourself and do what you do well,” Enfield said. “Your team, your strengths have gotten you this far to where you are. We’re a sixth seed because we have certain strengths on our basketball team, and we have to play to those strengths, and we have to do what we do well.” 
The Trojans tip off at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, Ind.

For championship contenders around the league, Christmas has arrived. With the NBA trade deadline just around the corner, teams without a shot at playoff contention are ponying up their veterans via the buyout market or trades in search of draft capital. 
The Brooklyn Nets were recently given a 6-foot-9 gift in the form of six-time All-Star Blake Griffin, while the Milwaukee Bucks found swingman PJ Tucker sitting under the Christmas tree in Houston. 
Now, the Los Angeles Lakers must add weapons to complete their armory as they look towards the NBA Playoffs in May. Here’s a look at some possible candidates for the Lakers to add to their roster. 
Andre Drummond: The Cleveland Cavaliers’ big man hasn’t seen the floor since Feb. 12 when the Cavs front office decided to put all their chips into the youth movement, inserting 22-year old Jarrett Allen into the starting lineup. Now, the Cavaliers, who sit at 12th in the Eastern Conference, are looking to trade the two-time All Star in exchange for draft picks. 
Don’t expect the Lakers to make any big trades with the deadline approaching. The Lakers’ most intriguing asset, 20-year-old Talen Horton Tucker, is likely more valuable to the team than any return the Lakers would get. His small-scale contract of 1.5 million dollars also makes it difficult for General Manager Rob Pelinka to match salaries with a player like Drummond, whose 28 million dollar contract is set to expire after the season’s end. If the Cavaliers find no suitors for Drummond, they’ll likely go the buyout route, making him a free agent. 
While playing for the Detroit Pistons and the Cavaliers, the 6-foot-11 center ate up a majority of possessions, forcing post-ups down low and missing bunnies at the rim. As of March 11, Drummond has posted the third-worst field goal percentage on layups this season at 43.6%. As a center, a majority of his attempts are layups — that does not bode well for a modern NBA offense. 
If the Lakers were to sign Drummond, it would require a complete attitude shift on Drummond’s behalf. There can be no more tunnel-visioning his way to the rim, looking off open teammates, and burping up a contested layup. He’d have to alter his game, focusing on the defensive end and limiting his field goal attempts. Drummond has never played for a legitimate contender before, so we don’t know if he would buy into the team’s system. But if anyone can get through to Andre Drummond, it would be LeBron James. 
Wayne Ellington: A reunion with the Purple and Gold may be in store for the 33-year-old shooting guard. On a Pistons team with the second-worst record in the league, Ellington’s asking price would likely be just a second round pick.
Ellington addresses one of the Lakers’ biggest issues: shooting. On paper, the Lakers seems to have the firepower necessary from beyond the arc to succeed. However, after shooting a scorching 62.7% from three in December and January, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope has regressed back to 34.4% in February and March. 
Wesley Matthews can’t seem to throw a rock into the ocean, shooting 33% on a career low 3.1 attempts from behind the line. As a team, the Lakers rank 21st in 3-point percentage on the season, a number that may come back to haunt them deep in the postseason. 
Ellington can kill an opposing defense when left open, shooting 42.2% from three, better than any player on the Lakers’ current roster. What the Lakers do excel at, however, is defense. Despite losing Anthony Davis the Lakers still boast the best defensive rating in the league by a wide margin. 
Ellington isn’t a terrible defender, but he isn’t an ace either. It’s on Rob Pelinka to decide if he is willing to bet the current Lakers can flip the switch from beyond the arc in the playoffs, or if a lights-out shooter is worth risking the team’s stellar defense. 
The Lakers may very well sprint to the trade deadline without making any moves. With Davis possibly healthy soon, this team is good enough to raise another championship banner in Staples Center. However, the Lakers aren’t perfect; three point shooting, rim protection, and vertical spacing are all issues that need to be addressed. All eyes are on Rob Pelinka as the March 25 deadline steadily approaches.

I know superheroes are real because I was raised by one. I come from a woman who is otherworldly in her grace, unrelenting in her sacrifice and whose story began thousands of miles away in a bustling island city. 
There is no question of her power: love. 
In truth, it’s unfathomable to me that she came to this country with a newborn at an age not much older than I am now. She is the well that I run back to time and time again, and with everything in me, I know that it is because of her selflessness that I even have the opportunity to share her story here. 
Apart from her, I was raised by two immigrant grandmothers — two women who embody resilience in the face of adversity in a new world. At home this semester, it has been a daily serotonin boost to find laughter and inspiration from the incandescent beings that I have the pleasure of being known to as “Ate.” Big sister. 
For Women’s History Month, I celebrate them. The women in my life are hardy, vibrant women of color. Their stories are real and gritty but triumphant in conquering the challenges presented to women in this age. 
I come from strong, immigrant women, and this is my love letter to them. 
I always used to ask my mom about her life in the Philippines. I still do. 
My mom is within the category of people that never fails to ask others if they’ve eaten yet or if they need anything. She finds joy in her house being a place that is home for more than just her children. In her life, her mother was not actively involved when she was growing up and suddenly — ironically — she’s now become like a mother to everyone who has come into her circle. 
In her superhero origin story, her independence shines through. Leaving home at eighteen and earning her spot in the dental program at the prestigious University of the Philippines in Manila, my mom was self-motivated to achieve her goals. She graduated early, and on top of that, she was pregnant with me when she did it. 
When I was born, there was a great shift in where she could see herself. My dad, who she met in dental school, was from Los Angeles. For me and the opportunities I might find in the United States, she would leave everything behind to come here. 
No matter how hard I try, words will always fail me in expressing how grateful I am for that amount of love. What followed after immigrating was no walk in the park, and I know that because it was a struggle we both shared. I remember in the years before our family had a car, she would tug my sister and I around town in a little red wagon. We would accompany her to the grocery store to redeem food stamps and to the library for some quiet time to ourselves. Life was a new adventure every day, but looking back, I was never worried because I knew my mom had it handled. 
My mom has weathered countless storms and has donned an innumerable number of hats since immigrating. She is Wonder Woman in her adaptability. 
She has worked the night shift, worked double shifts, built up dental offices, raised three children, flipped some houses, and she’s even managed to find time to show us, her children, the world. She is a true jack of all trades and if there’s anyone that I honor this month, it is her. 
My grandma, my Lolie, is another. 
On my dad’s side of the family, we know who the boss is. She’s known to us as ‘Lolie,’ a play on the Philipino word for grandmother which is lola. There is a duality about her that never fails to make me laugh. She is tough as nails, while being one of the sweetest, gentlest people I know. 
Her immigration story also shaped her life. In the 1960s, she came to the US with her elder brother and from there, she married my grandpa and had two boys. 
Their life was by no means easy, of that I am wholly sure. Because of my grandpa’s work, they moved a great deal and with two young boys, it was never an easy transition from one place to the next. Still, she found the time to graduate cum laude from Texas Woman’s University and from there, her life’s work would be dedicated to social welfare. 
It wasn’t long into their life as a family when my grandma began her battle with breast cancer and her journey was strained further by the question of income. It would be a long road to remission, but she would eventually add cancer to the long list of struggles she had overcome. 
There is no doubt in my mind that the world is better because of immigrant women. These are the women who shatter glass ceilings and leave a ladder behind them for the next generation. These are the women who are the backbone of society and leave things just a little bit better than when they had found it because that’s just what immigrants do. 
I am proud to call myself an immigrant woman, and I am proud to know the history and love that has been lent to my story. 
I come from them, and for that fact, I am deeply grateful.
