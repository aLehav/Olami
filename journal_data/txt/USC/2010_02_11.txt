“Who says the arts are dead in L.A.?” said USC President Steven B. Sample at a gala honoring Robert Redford with the very first Robert Redford Award for Engaged Artists.

Sample was referring to the great progress made by the School of Theatre under the guidance of Dean Madeline Puzo in creating informed artists and participating members of society.
In Sample’s mind, the paths these artists have chosen are akin to Redford’s insofar as they involve preserving the arts and changing society for the better. As USC alumnus Frank Brown said, Redford is “not just an important star, but he has a social conscience.” Accordingly, it is understandable why the committee created this award and quickly chose Redford as its first recipient.
As Puzo said in her speech, Redford exemplifies both words in the name of the award: “engaged” and “artist.” Redford seems, however, to be such a humble, reserved person that the main reason he agreed to come out to the event was to raise scholarship money for prospective School of Theatre students who would not otherwise be able to afford to attend the school. He wants to make sure that students from underprivileged backgrounds have the opportunity to raise themselves out of their present situations with art, as he was able to.
To kick off the event and bring the audience’s attention back to the stage after dinner, there were performances of Broadway-style songs. The five performers, all recent alumni of the School of Theatre, held Redford in rapt attention as he watched from the audience. Their performance typified the very things everyone was there to support: confidence in self, natural talent honed by the School of Theatre and what the future of art — and theater in particular — will look like.
The Greco-themed room at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel was filled with celebrities, supporters of the School of Theatre and a handful of theater students who worked the event.
Redford was introduced by his friend Sid Ganis, former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Actress Meryl Streep spoke in a tribute video celebrating Redford’s career and his many humanitarian projects that accompanied the introduction. In the video, actress Meryl Streep spoke about Redford.
“[I think] he has been successful because he just doesn’t give a damn about what people think about him,” Streep said in the video address.
Gala Vice Chair Sally Field also spoke in the video and described how much Redford has inspired her just simply by being true to himself.
“Creative voice is independent voice,” Field said.
This idea is emblematic of Redford’s entire career, especially since the creation of the Sundance Institute, which gives many young filmmakers and actors the chance to get their work distributed to a wider market with the help of the namesake Sundance Film Festival, she said.
Through his extensive filmography, Redford has inspired several generations of young film-industry hopefuls and continues to do so. Casey Dolkas, a senior majoring in theatre, was deeply affected by Redford’s work.
“I feel honored to be here as a VIP escort, an ambassador to represent the School of Theatre,” Dolkas said. “Robert Redford is someone I would like to emulate my career after because he really has done it all: theater, film, T.V., directing — not to mention the philanthropic work he did, for example the Sundance Institute.”
When Redford took the stage, he was met with a standing ovation, but he appeared unsure of how to deal with all the praise.
“I was thinking about calling a cab,” said Redford.
Theater is very important to Redford, who started his career as a stage actor.
“Theater is dangerous, exciting … and powerful because of the intimacy with the audience,” he said. As an actor, he said he finds it more rewarding than film for these reasons.
Redford also spoke about how honored he felt to have his name attached to the new program and that the award is attached to USC, “such a prodigious school.” The award, which will be presented annually, will go to artists who have demonstrated great creative and social accomplishments throughout their lifetimes.
Ultimately, it wasn’t about a night of fancy dress, expensive food, cameras or the award itself. In the spirit of Redford’s own ideals, instead it was about giving a new generation of artists the opportunity to follow their dreams, hone their talents and become future art leaders and philanthropists.
once again the DT fails to proof the article… editors must be hungover from last night at the 9-0… it’s the school of theatRE not theatER school…

The new film Valentine’s Day, which opens today, offers audiences “a day in the life of love,” but, as most could easily predict, the film will not be offering anything new.
Most Hollywood films about romance tend toward the same dull conventions of narrative and form — as is the case with Valentine’s Day. This is particularly unfortunate because, as entertaining as they might be, most modern romantic films really have nothing to offer other than a fantasy of living happily ever after, which becomes painfully tiresome in adaptation after adaptation.
With so many films held to contemporary Hollywood’s rigid standards — excluding last year’s (500) Days of Summer — it can be quite refreshing to take a look at other depictions of romance that are often neglected.
Here are five films about love that evoke laughs, irritation, sentiment, insanity and even tragedy, all the while being through and through romantic.
The Rules of Attraction satirically depicts the death of romance in a college environment. Director Roger Avary’s film follows the lives of three liberal arts students who find themselves involved in a love triangle that is dominated by sexual desire and regards the idea of romantic love as archaic.
James Van Der Beek steals the film by giving the performance of his career as a hopeless romantic who has sex with any girl he can, even though he believes himself to be in love with only one. His character tries his best to embrace romance, but, by existing in a society that promotes endless promiscuity, circumstance prevents him from ever learning how to love.
Hannah and Her Sisters, which earned writer-director Woody Allen an Oscar for its screenplay, portrays the love lives of three sisters who, over the course of a year, all end up swapping lovers. The film brilliantly conveys the confusion and erratic decisions so often made while in love, but it does so in a comical manner that allows audiences to laugh even at the most depressing aspects of love.
An ensemble cast, featuring Allen, Mia Farrow and Michael Caine, honestly relates loss with discovery by following relationships that fall apart and the work that must be done in order to overcome the confusion surrounding the art of making love last.
Shampoo features Warren Beatty as a male hairdresser who is in love with all women. He only went to beauty school in order to be around them, but, as the film progresses, a love triangle easily shatters his ultimate desire of being loved by every woman he meets. The beauty behind this classic is its ability to mix both comedy and actual drama to expose the real immaturity behind stubborn romantic perspectives.
Robert Towne’s brilliant script places Beatty’s character in some of the most ironic and painfully funny circumstances, the best of which involves him in bed with one woman, whom he suddenly leaves to go to bed with another — all the while satirizing his real-life notoriety as a Hollywood stud of the 1970s.
David Lynch’s Wild at Heart is one of the most intense and insane love stories ever told. Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern play two lovers on the run from hired killers, mobsters and a very pragmatic matriarch as they continuously find themselves in bizarre adventures all so they can love one another.
Cage’s character, a violent ex-con who is obsessed with Elvis, battles some of the most sinister characters imaginable in a film filled with exploitative sex and violence that eerily weaves in a sinister motif resembling The Wizard of Oz.
Finally, one of the most underrated romantic films ever made is Vincent Gallo’s comedy Buffalo ’66. Just released from prison, Gallo’s character kidnaps a girl and forces her to pretend to be his girlfriend in front of his incredibly disturbed parents before he plans to murder the man responsible for his imprisonment.
As he falls for his hostage, the film’s humor derives from Gallo’s ability to express every embarrassing emotion with such perfection that he literally personifies every romantic sentiment through his manic behavior.
Gallo, who also wrote and directed the film, embodies every stupid and resentful mistake ever made in the game of love. His outbursts openly contrast with his ability to be genuine.
These films are all love stories, but the difference between them and Valentine’s Day is that in the other films romance is propelled through the turbulence of life by (often comical) misfortunes.
These outlandish interpretations of romance actually promote more humanism and provide a much more relatable experience because the characters in these films all have intentions of finding true romance, just like the rest of us, they have just as hard a time accomplishing it.

When it comes to street food, every country has its own trademark. Paris is known for its crêpes, Vietnam for its pho and Mexico for its tacos. And in the United States, each region has its own famous street food: cheese steaks in Philadelphia, pretzels and hotdogs in New York and barbequed pork sandwiches in Memphis.

In Los Angeles, taco trucks reign supreme, but there are other mobile eateries parked across the city serving up everything from dosas to sushi to gourmet sandwiches. Los Angeles’ food-truck scene has grown rapidly in the last few years, which is why native Angelenos Shawna Dawson and Sonja Rasula decided it was finally time to celebrate residents’ common love for both street food and the city.
This Saturday, some of the most popular and innovative street food vendors will convene in one single location to provide a sampling of the best representation of the best street food the city has to offer. Organized and initiated by Dawson, a USC alumna and former Los Angeles community manager of Yelp, and Rasula, founder and director of Unique L.A., the event is the first gathering of its kind, uniting almost 40 different street food vendors from around the city.
“Los Angeles has such a deep and rich history with street food,” Rasula said. “We wanted to celebrate both the new gourmet food trucks and all the old, authentic street food … by combining everything in one festival.”
It is such a simple and obvious idea that one might wonder why it took anyone so long to organize such an event. But street food has neither the best reputation nor an orderly system for conducting business. Within the last few months, there have already been reports of complaints by neighboring restaurants that street food vendors are a nuisance to the city and a threat to their businesses.
From the city’s perspective, it is tough to deal with street food businesses because, unlike restaurant businesses, mobile vendors do not have fixed locations, making it difficult to enforce food safety laws and the city’s ban on street vending.
But the owners of these street food vendors are not criminals, Rasula says. Most of them try to run their business as ethically and peacefully as possible. For example, Gastrobus — a husband and wife-owned food truck selling bistro food — mainly follows around farmers’ markets. In fact, it is through the locally bought produce that owner Antonio Medina draws his inspiration for the day’s menu.
“We are thinking of switching to totally organic so that we can support [the farmer’s market vendors],” Medina said. “They are great people, and we have created such a great relationship with them.”
Medina makes an effort to play fair, as well.
“I try not to park in front of restaurants. That’s not ethical; that’s stealing their business,” said Medina, “and I’m just staying away from the places where the cops are.”
Fortunately, there are advocacy groups — such as the Southern California Vendors Food Association, with whom Rasula and Dawson have partnered for this festival — that are attempting to bring legitimacy to the oft-criticized street vendors. To these groups, street food is a huge benefit to the community as it promotes the city’s diversity and cultural history.
“[Street food] is one of the most amazing, beautiful and delicious things that this city has to offer, and I think it is important that street food has a voice,” Rasula said. “I think we are trying to show the general population a political side — that street food vendors can follow up with laws, they want the permits, they want to serve good food and they just want to be part of the community. They don’t go against the grain. Hopefully, this festival will show that street food is delicious, clean and healthy and that these vendors are ready to take it to the new level in Los Angeles.”
And apparently so are Angelenos. Inspired by the recent boom of food trucks within the past year, Dawson approached Rasula in December about partnering to coordinate an event to celebrate Los Angeles’ diverse street food. By the first week of January, the decision was made, and, in the next few weeks, news of Los Angeles’ first annual Street Food Fest spread around the city via Twitter — the mobile food vendor’s dream promotional platform.
“The first thing when we decided to take on this festival was to sign up for a Twitter account,” Rasula said. “Twitter is insane for food festivals, and it has been an unbelievable resource for us. Especially because a lot of these food trucks already have a lot of crazy fans and followers, we’ve been able to reach thousands and thousands of people. It is interesting how Twitter has changed the media landscape.”
Both Rasula and Dawson have new media backgrounds and have had many experiences with web design, but even with all the online experiences, the energy and time spent on organizing this event has been consuming.
“I would honestly say that I’ve been working 24/7 for the past five weeks,” Rasula said. “This is definitely the biggest and quickest event that either of us have ever done.”
First, they had to procure a location that would be in the heart of the city yet able to accommodate thousands of people. They eventually settled on a private venue, the Los Angeles Center Studios, so that they would be able to serve alcohol, they said. The place is also close to Metro stops so that getting there is convenient and environmentally friendly.
Next came the selection of vendors. In addition to the new gourmet food trucks such as the Grilled Cheese Truck and Gastrobus, there will also be food vendors from the now-dispersed East Los Angeles congregating spot Breed Street and other authentic vendors like Antojitos Mi Abuelita and Mama Koh’s Korean Chicken, they said. The vendors have all committed to keeping their food’s prices to $5 or less, with the average item costing about $2.
With so much food to eat and limited stomach space, Rasula recommends that customers go with a group of friends in order to target four or five food vendors, share the food with one another and try as much as possible. And because of the cheap prices, $20 could allow customers to sample from eight to 10 vendors.
There will be vendors selling non-food items as well. Rasula has selected 30 art and design vendors to attend, making a quaint, uniquely L.A. marketplace. She specifically chose vendors who would complement the food theme. For example, one of the non-food vendors is Paper Pastries, a line of gift cards and stationary adorned with cupcakes, pastries and bacon.
Dawson and Rasula also gave much thought into selecting the event date, eventually deciding on Valentine’s Day weekend.
“There are a lot of people who don’t necessarily buy into Valentine’s per se and perhaps cannot afford to buy expensive gifts and dinners, so we thought this would be a perfect opportunity for those on a budget,” Rasula said. “It’s also a perfect alternative for those who might not have a significant other and just want to hang out with their friends and do something fun and cool over the weekend.”
Ultimately, this event is not just about the food. Rather, it is about bringing Angelenos together in one location to celebrate everything Los Angeles — from the food to the art to the music to, of course, the people.
“We want everybody in the world to know that Los Angeles is a beautiful, world-class city filled with great people and great things,” Rasula said. “I think it’s about time that Los Angeles starts to stand up for itself and shows off a little bit because I truly believe that this is the most exciting city to be living in right now.”
wow joe schmoe is my intellectual hero with the school yard arguments.  diss LA and throw up the apple as some sort of proof he’s better. well in a city of 8 million i’m sure NY has its share of uncouth and uncultured idiots who happen to make their way to LA on daddy’s money!
“We want everybody in the world to know that Los Angeles is a beautiful, world-class city filled with great people and great things,” Rasula said
…Los Angeles has some of the most uncouth, uncultured and unsophisticated people I’ve come across. People here don’t know anything about current events, the arts, aren’t well-read and so forth. And your food sucks too.
Spoken like someone who is jealous they cannot afford to live in LA.
I live in NY city, a place more than double the cost of living than LA there homie… You’re the one whose nerves were struck to even respond. Sorry there, Mr. Simplistic. You’re beneath my mark in life; I’ll stop here so to mitigate further embarrassment on your part killuh.
Another thing, you’re probably not well-travelled (it’s exhorbitant, you probably CANNOT AFFORD IT), thus you wouldn’t know what it’s like in the Big Apple kid. The typical, ad-hominem attack that that people from USC fall back on is: “I’m better looking than you”; “We’re money, you’re not”…
Now go back to your financial aid office to see what IRS coverup your mother uses as a hooker. Oh yeah, sorry dog (it’s your crass Angelino-lingo), I already met your sloppy mother last night and she didn’t have change for a dollar. I let her please my phallic senses orally instead. 
Are those bruises on her ribs healed up? Next time I won’t hit her so hard. LOL…

The USC Program Board has recently launched a new website that helps inform students about the various events going on around campus and gives them insight into the roles of Program Board’s committees and assemblies.
This website is the third prong in a series of public relations applications Program Board has created to help keep the students informed.
Program Board has had a website in the past, but the brand new version is free of technical kinks and is more informative and better organized.
“We really needed this new, redesigned website to be about the events, and I really like how the website now gets that across,” said Joseph Zuniga, Program Board’s executive director. “There’s always something that the Program Board is doing at USC and the students need to know about it.”
Program Board will hold a special public relations event to promote its new website, Twitter account and spring events calendar in mid-February. This will be treated as the “grand opening” for the three new media applications.
USC Program Board is the programming branch under the Undergraduate Student Government. The plan a variety of events at USC, such as film screenings, food fairs, concerts and discussion panels.

While USC faces self-imposed sanctions due to allegations that O.J. Mayo received cash and gifts during his tenure at USC, Mayo is looking forward to playing for the USA Basketball Men’s National Team.
Mayo joins a pool of 27 NBA players who will represent USA Basketball from 2010 until 2012.  USA Basketball Chairman Jerry Colangelo announced the members of the team yesterday.  Alongside Mayo will be nine members from the 2008 U.S. Olympic team who won the gold, and Duke University head coach Mike Krzyzewski will maintain his position as the team’s head coach.
Mayo of the Memphis Grizzlies and his teammates will be training for the 2010 FIBA World Championship that will be held in Turkey from Aug. 28 to Sept. 12. The team’s ultimate goal is to qualify for and win the gold at the 2012 Olympics in London.
Krzyzewski will once again stress teamwork and catering to each player’s strengths as the formula for success for the 2010-2012 team.  Mayo is already pleased with the chemistry the team is showing in practice.
“So many times when you’re competing for spots and playing for something much larger guys tend to get off rhythm,” Mayo said to The Commercial Appeal of Memphis, Tennessee. “But the guys were playing together, really having fun and competing hard. It means a lot to be a part of it.”
While at USC for only the 2007-2008 season, Mayo averaged 20.7 points per game and helped the Trojans earn a bid to the NCAA Tournament.  The Trojans lost in the first round to Kansas State.  However, Mayo’s year at USC is tainted with allegations that Rodney Guillory, a Los Angeles events promoter, accepted about $200,000 from a Northern California sports agency, and then allegedly transferred the money to Mayo.
Mayo, who was the third pick of the first round from the 2008 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves, is currently in his second season with the Grizzlies and has a career average of 18.2 points per game.  He was the runner-up to Derrick Rose for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, and was a member of the 2008 USA Basketball Select Team.

With an entry line starting at Bovard Auditorium and circling around Doheny Library hundreds of feet away, Aziz Ansari’s stand-up act Monday night drew a crowd of more than 500 students. Full of ruckus, laughter and commotion, this highly entertaining event hosted by the USG Program Board Speakers Committee was definitely a hit.
Funny people - Stand-up comic and screen actor Aziz Ansari performed to an engaged audience at Bovard Auditorium on Monday Night. - Daily Trojan | Mike Lee
The night began with an opening act by Dan Levy who has made appearances on Comedy Central’s Premium Blend and The Late Late Show and also won the title of “Funniest College Comedian in America” at the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in 2001. Levy’s engaging act definitely set the bar high for the evening. Although he tended to lean on stereotypical college themes such as sex and drugs like many other comedians, Levy repurposed the familiar material in creative ways to get laughs.
Levy continued his act by elaborating on an encounter with Justin Timberlake at the gym, saying he was absolutely dumbfounded to see him. With nothing else on his mind, he awkwardly spurred a conversation about Timberlake’s shoes and ended with, “Congrats on your success!” leading to an uproar of laughter from the audience. The opening act ended with an amusing comparison between Circuit City and RadioShack, when Levy questioned why a whole city of circuits went out of business but a little shack of radios somehow survived.
As Aziz Ansari made his entrance after Levy’s opening act, a stream of camera flashes lit up the stage. Although Ansari was seemingly flustered and a little annoyed by all the flashing lights, he comically posed for all the pictures while pretending to tell jokes and then politely asked everyone to put their cameras away. The impromptu ‘photo shoot’ definitely set the stage for Ansari’s casual act.
As the night went on, students could not control their laughter. The most appealing part of his act was the way in which he made even the simplest topics like researching on Wikipedia seem so amusing. During the act, Ansari went on to explain how Wikipedia allows him to waste valuable time over unimportant topics like finding out which Home Alone movie made the most money. His search only led to more searches and he opened tabs to find out that Joe Pesci’s father was a fork operator, a fact that Ansari figured would not really be useful when attempting to impress women.
Another aspect about Ansari’s comedy that truly stood out was the fact that, unlike other South Asian comedians like Russell Peters, Ansari did not rely on racial stereotypes, accents and impressions to back up the performance. His piece was definitely a lot more personal, which added a certain variety and originality that surely appealed to the audience. Instead of mimicking other accents and doing racial impressions, Ansari decided to make a set of jokes about a section on Wikipedia entirely dedicated to racial slurs and later went on to substituting them with ‘Star Wars’ references.
The show was definitely not complete without the appearance of “Raaaaaaaandy,” the standup comic Ansari played in Judd Apatow’s film Funny People. Ansari went on to introduce more Randy pieces and talk about his infamous two cousins Harris and Darwish, entertaining the audience with his impressions.
With his past roles in Funny People and I Love You, Man and regular appearances as Tom Haverford on NBC’s comedy Parks and Recreation, Ansari is the upcoming comedian to look out for in 2010.
Whether its about unlimited Wikipedia tabs on Internet Explorer, Joe Pesci’s father’s occupation or Randy’s sexual encounters in a variety of locations including but not limited to a rollercoaster, Roscoe’s Chicken and Waffles, the library and the Lost Island, every obscure theme added to a great night of comedy and entertainment.
Aziz Ansari’s impeccable comic timing and originality sets the bar high for comedians looking to make it big and this is really just the start for him. At only 26 years of age, Ansari has surely reached an accomplishment to which we just have to mimic Dan Levy and say, “Congrats on your success!”

U.S. Rep. Diane Watson (D-Calif.) announced Thursday that she will retire and not run for re-election at the end of this year, closing her nearly three decades as a prominent African American political leader.
The Washington Post reported that the seat vacated by the 76-year-old Democrat will most likely stay within the same political party. Watson, however, did not endorse a successor, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Watson represents the 33rd District in Southern California, which includes USC and is considered overwhelmingly Democratic, according to CNN. In 2008, 75 percent of the district voted for President Barack Obama during the presidential election.
She is not the first senator to announce her intent to vacate a Congressional seat, as 12 other House Democrats and 17 House Republicans have decided not run for another term, according to the Washington Post.
Watson had been the first African American woman elected to the Los Angles School Board. She also served 10 years on the California State Senate before former President Bill Clinton appointed her to ambassador for Micronesia.
She ran for Congress in 2001 in a special election to fill the seat after the death of Rep. Julian Dixon.
The Los Angeles Times reported that Watson intends to spend more time with her mother, who just turned 100.
An expected candidate for Watson’s seat is California Assembly Speaker Karen Bass, a source told the Los Angeles Times.
Bass refused to comment, saying only, “Diane Watson has been a great leader for Los Angeles.”

For a man who has made as many headlines with his communication skills as his coaching abilities, it is no surprise that Lane Kiffin has taken his act to the next level: Twitter.
In a month that is characterized as the quietest period in the year-round circus known formally as the USC football program, the newly-hired coach has interrupted the silence surrounding Heritage Hall with a social networking debut that will only enhance his ability to utilize new age media as a self-serving mouthpiece.
While his debut on Sept. 2 in Hawaii will likely receive much more national attention than today’s entrance into a world defined by Tweets, followers, and 140-character status updates, his initiation into the Twittersphere should put fans, pundits, and those close to the football program on watch.
On one hand, Kiffin’s acceptance of modern technology plays well to his most importance audience, his players. Over the past year Twitter.com has infiltrated the sports world like few other industries around the country. While popular personalities like Shaquille O’Neill, Pete Carroll, and Lance Armstrong have been pioneers in integrating the social media network as a fabric in professional sports, everyone from the NBA to the NFL to former- Texas Tech coach Mike Leach have done everything in their power to create a schism between athletes and their Twitter accounts.
Kiffin’s insistence on following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Carroll, can be construed as an attempt to show his youth at age 34 or as just another platform for an outspoken coach to speak his mind through Internet-driven binary code, regardless buckle up it should be an interesting ride.
Kiffin’s first official Tweet Thursday afternoon — “We’re very fortunate and excited about continuing the great tradition of Trojan football! Thanks for your continued support” — lent very little insight into the controversial figure Kiffin has become over the past few years, but rest assured his Twitter profile will likely contain the candid remarks he is best known for.

Two weeks after climbing to second place in the conference, the USC women’s basketball team finds itself mired in a stretch of poor play that culminated in a blowout loss to No. 2 Stanford.
Driving force · USC coach Michael Cooper has revitalized the Women of Troy this season, but a recent stretch of poor play has hurt the team. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
Things won’t get any easier for the Women of Troy going forward.
Next on tap for USC (13-9, 7-4) is a difficult road game against crosstown rival UCLA. The Bruins (15-7, 8-3) sit one game ahead of USC in the conference standings.
“We’re going in there expecting it to be a war,” USC assistant coach Mary Wooley said. “That game has been notorious for being a physical, aggressive game, and I don’t think it’s going to be any different on Saturday.”
The Women of Troy beat UCLA 70-63 earlier this season behind 24 points from sophomore guard Ashley Corral and 19 points and six assists from sophomore guard Briana Gilbreath. USC trailed for much of that game before a late spurt in the second half carried the team to victory.
It will be more difficult for the Women of the Troy to beat UCLA this time around. Poor free throw shooting in the first meeting prevented UCLA from capitalizing on its rebounding advantage. The Bruins outrebounded USC 36-29 but shot just 9 of 20 from the foul line.
“Obviously, rebounding is a big must for us every game,” senior guard Heather Oliver said. “Hitting shots is a big thing for us.”
If the Women of Troy can keep the Bruins off the glass, the team is confident it can shut down the UCLA offense. The only question is whether it can generate enough points of its own. USC shot just 18 percent from the field against Stanford.
“Defensively, we can pretty much hold any team in the country,” Wooley said. “We need to be ready to execute offensively. That’s something that obviously really held us back against Stanford and Cal.”
One thing that should help USC on offense is the continued development of redshirt junior guard Jacki Gemelos, who is rounding into shape after multiple knee surgeries. Gemelos paced the Women of Troy against Stanford with 13 points.
“Her first game she was a natural,” Wooley said. “You could see her making plays that most basketball players [aren’t] able to make.”
For their part, the team seems eager to put the Stanford game behind it and get on with the season.
“This week is not about the loss we had,” Oliver said. “It’s about UCLA.”
The game is scheduled for tip-off at 11 a.m. Saturday.

The No. 9 USC women’s swimming and diving team looks to regain momentum against rival UCLA on Saturday in its last dual meet of the season.
Since easing past UC Santa Barbara in early January, USC (10-2, 3-2) has been swimming upstream in conference meets, splitting a tough double header against top-5 teams two weeks ago with an upset win at No. 5 California and a loss to No. 4 Stanford the following day. Now the Women of Troy face a competitive UCLA squad (5-3, 2-3) led by school 100-meter and 200-meter breaststroke record holder Brittany Beauchan.
“UCLA is pretty strong in the breaststroke event — they have a girl there that’s one of the top in the country,” USC coach Dave Salo said of Beauchan. “They have some bits and pieces that make them pretty strong, and this dual meet always brings out the best in both teams. You can’t count them out.”
USC will need another strong effort from several top swimmers this weekend before the Pac-10 championships begin Feb. 24.
Sophomore Katinka Hosszu and junior Lyndsay DePaul dominated at the Southern California Swimming Grand Prix at Belmont Plaza last week, finishing 1-2 respectively in the 200-yard fly with times of 1:53.99 and 1:55.45. Freshman Yumi So also swam well, taking fourth with a season-best and NCAA ‘B’ cut 1:58.88.
Junior Presley Bard, an Indiana transfer who became eligible earlier this month, continued to impress, taking fifth in both the 100-yard free (49.44) and the 200-yard back (1:56.75), while freshman diver Ariel Rittenhouse won the 3-meter springboard at the UCLA Diving Invite in Westwood with 342.40 points.
With so many standout individuals, the challenge for USC might be focusing on team goals this Saturday and in the postseason.
“We should do pretty well at the NCAA Championships if they stay together,” Salo said. “If they start branching off as individuals, I think we suffer the consequences of that. They need to rely on each other.”
The good news for the Women of Troy is that, for the first time in nearly a month, they face a team not ranked in the top 5 in the nation. The unranked Bruins swam like anchors in their past two dual meets, losing to Stanford and Cal by a combined 82 points, and have yet to beat a ranked opponent.
Then again, this is rivalry week, and, as Salo knows, that can change everything.
“When we go to the UCLA meet, everyone steps up their game,” Salo said. “It’s no different than the basketball team or the football team. It’s UCLA. We want to crush the Bruins. It makes for a real exciting meet.”

Fittingly, during this long President’s Day weekend, the No. 1 men’s tennis team (6-0, 0-0) will travel across the country to Thomas Jefferson’s old stomping grounds in Charlottesville, Va.
Top spot · Junior Jaak Poldma and the Trojans enter the ITA’s National Team Indoor Championships in Charlottesville, Va. as the top-ranked team. team. - Gary Fung | Daily Trojan 
In this historically-rich location, the Trojans hope to make history as the top seed at the ITA National Team Indoor Championships — hosted by second-seeded University of Virginia (4-1, 0-0).
Two weeks ago, as winners of the ITA Kick-Off Weekend, USC qualified for the opportunity to face off against the top squads from across the nation.
The Trojans are looking forward to the increased fervor and competition that comes with playing a tournament of this magnitude.
“The season goes up a couple of levels in intensity at the [ITA Indoor tournament],” USC coach Peter Smith said. “This tournament is an excellent way to compare ourselves against other top teams.”
First up on the Trojans’ slate is a first round matchup against No. 26 Fresno State (7-1), where Smith was the head coach from 1992 to 1997. The Bulldogs are riding a hot streak coming into the tournament, coming off upset victories over No. 17 Texas A&M (4-2, 0-0) and No. 32 Rice University (5-1, 0-0) during the Kick-Off Weekend.
Also, in its half of the draw, USC finds Pac-10 rivals No. 9 Stanford  (4-0, 0-0) and No. 4 UCLA (2-0, 0-0). This potentially sets up second and third round matches against familiar foes.
Even if the potential Pac-10 matchups do not work out, the rest of the teams — other than Fresno State — are all ranked in the top 20, providing a true test for the nation’s top-ranked squad.
Playing tennis indoors fosters the ambience of big-time college tennis. Not only do the players not have to deal with the sun or other weather conditions, but the intensity is palpable with the echoing play and of the players cheering their squads on.
As with the opening six-match homestand, Smith would like to see how his lesser experienced players — like freshman J.T. Sundling and junior Peter Lucassen — respond as the season progresses.
Obviously, the Trojans would like to fly home as victors, but Smith does not place extra pressure on his squad as he continues to evaluate his team.
“The Indoors will provide a great atmosphere as well as a great lesson for our team,” Smith said.

The undefeated No. 8 USC women’s tennis team (5-0) has a big weekend ahead with a trip to the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Indoor Championships at the University of Wisconsin.
The Women of Troy qualified for this competitive out-of-state action with victories against both San Diego and Auburn during qualifying play two weeks ago.
Sixteen teams qualified to compete in the tournament this weekend, all of which are ranked in the top 20 in the country.
No. 1 Duke and No. 2 Northwestern could be in the future for the Women of Troy if they can make it past the first few rounds.
Last week, the Women of Troy also jumped up one spot in their ITA team ranking, from No. 9 to No. 8.
“It’s a small change, so it doesn’t have that big of an effect,” sophomore Alison Ramos said. “But it’s definitely a start, though we still aren’t satisfied being ranked No. 8.”
USC also has four players ranked among the nation’s top 50 in singles: No. 8 Maria Sanchez, No. 18 Danielle Lao, No. 37 Valeria Pulido and No. 38 Alison Ramos. In doubles, Pulido and Sanchez team up at No. 19.
USC’s first opponent of the weekend, the Tigers, also recently improved its team ranking. After recently upsetting No. 4 Georgia (4-3), Clemson rose from No. 15 to No. 14 last week as well. Clemson has three players nationally ranked in singles: No. 9 Josipa Bek, No. 61 Nelly Ciolkowski and No. 113 Ina Hadziselimovic. In doubles, Bek and Hadziselimovic are ranked No. 4.
USC is 7-0 all-time against Clemson after facing it in last year’s ITA Team Indoors and beating it 4-3 in the consolation second round.
“We are getting the chance to play teams from the East Coast that we don’t get to play during the season,” Ramos said. “It’s all very exciting to not only play new competition but also to get the chance to play indoors.”
USC will open competition today at 3:30 p.m. CST facing Clemson in the first round of play for a chance to move into Saturday’s 3:30 p.m. quarterfinal round. Semifinals will then be held Sunday at 3:30 p.m., with the championship match set for Monday, Feb. 15.

It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s … DeMar DeRozan?
Not quite. But for this weekend, he will have to do.
Nobody is going to mistake the former USC basketball star for Superman. Nobody will even mistake him for Super Dwight.
But on Saturday night, DeMar DeRozan will have me watching the slam dunk competition during the NBA’s All-Star Weekend.
Most of America probably circled Feb. 13 on their calendars after LeBron James declared last year that he was putting his hat in the ring for the 2010 dunk competition.
Those same people reached for the White-Out when he took his hat out of the ring. The dream lineup of James, Kobe Bryant and Vince Carter was gone.
Instead, a ho-hum cast of characters will dunk in Jerry World, Dallas Cowboys’ new stadium.
Hometown hero Nate Robinson (hometown meaning New York) has had some epic battles over the last couple of years. It’s been fun to watch Krypto-Nate versus Super Dwight.
But with no Dwight Howard at the 2010 competition, the conflict isn’t there. And neither is a compelling story.
Lakers backup guard Shannon Brown isn’t exactly a major attraction. Neither is Bobcats forward Gerald Wallace, even if he is having a great year.
High flyer · Former Trojan DeMar DeRozan will compete in the NBA All-Star Weekend’s “Dunk-Off”, where he will compete against the Clippers’ Eric Gordon for a bid to the weekend’s actual dunk contest. - Daily Trojan file photo 
And if Clippers guard Eric Gordon wins the dunk-off? Forget about it. Television off.
DeRozan is the only reason to watch the dunk contest Saturday night.
His growth from the start of the season to now has been noticeable. His minutes-per-game average has increased with each passing month, and his scoring has followed suit.
He has shown some flashes of brilliance, including four straight double-digit scoring performances in early December and a spectacular put-back dunk a couple of nights ago.
And if he wins, he’ll make history.
DeRozan would become the second Trojan to win the slam dunk contest since Harold Miner did it in 1993 and 1995.
USC would then become only the second school to have multiple slam dunk contest winners, joining North Carolina (Michael Jordan and Carter).
And the Pac-10 would have its fifth different competition winner, joining Miner, Nate Robinson (UW), Fred Jones (Oregon) and Brent Barry (Oregon State). That would give the conference one more winner than the Atlantic Coast Conference.
Yes, a Robinson victory would make him the competition’s first three-time winner. But wouldn’t it be nice to see USC exact a measure of revenge against Washington?
DeRozan’s bid to win the competition also brings up another question: Where does he rank among the best Trojan dunkers to come through the Galen Center?
It would be impossible to place him above Miner, but, in the Galen Center era, the competition is wide open.
O.J. Mayo? In his one year at USC, he seemed to prefer breakaway layups and finger rolls to high-flying dunks.
Taj Gibson? He threw down some emphatic dunks as a Trojan, but none of the spectacular, free-throw-line-takeoff variety.
Davon Jefferson? He also electrified the Galen Center crowd, but his dunks weren’t pieces of art.
The only real competition DeRozan has in this department comes from senior forward Marcus Johnson.
In fact, give me Johnson to win it all.
DeRozan can dunk, but Johnson can flat out fly. No one will ever forget his posterization of California’s Jorge Gutierrez last year at Galen. And the alley-oop this season against Washington?
Now that was a piece of art.
Johnson said after the game: “Sometimes there’s no eye contact, I just happen to see the ball in the air. Tonight, it was no eye contact. [Mike Gerrity] just threw the ball as I was running.”
Wait, what? He didn’t even see the point guard throw the pass? And he still threw it down in emphatic fashion?
Incredible.
DeRozan will have to pull something spectacular tomorrow night to keep up with Johnson.
If he can’t, the contest won’t be worth watching.
“Thrilla on Manilla Paper” runs every other Friday. To comment on this article, visit dailytrojan.com or e-mail Grant at tunkel@usc.edu.
I’ll take Marcus ddunking over Derozan anyday.. far more athletic..Marcus also has room for growth which is scary
Don’t forget that DeMar has never lost a dunk contest.  He won the high school dunk contest at the McDonalds All American pre-game festivities, and had some pretty amazing dunks last year vs. UCLA.  He is also a few yrs younger than Johnson so there is lots of room for DeRozan’s improvement

After winning four out of its first five games in 2010, including a strong performance in the Stanford Invitational last weekend, the No. 2 USC women’s water polo team remains poised for a strong showing in its home opener Saturday against No. 7 Loyola Marymount.
“There is nothing like playing at home. You have your home crowd, you’re at your home pool and you have the home court advantage like everybody says,” said senior two-meter Kami Craig. “It’s just fun, and we hope to start out with a bang.”
But defeating their intra-city rivals and starting off 1-0 at home won’t come easy, as the undefeated Lions are presently ranked seventh nationally after winning the UC San Diego Triton Invitational last week. Additionally, they feature a rising star in sophomore two-meter Kimberly Bendetti, who was named Western Water Polo Player of the Week on Wednesday after scoring 11 goals in the tournament.
“They definitely have a few good players we’ve been looking at,” said senior goalie Tumua Anae, who already has 36 saves on the season. “I think that going into this weekend, with our first home game, we just want to come in and win,”
And the Women of Troy certainly have the offensive firepower to put themselves in the position to do just that. In their four victories this year, which most recently included a 13-3 shellacking of fifth ranked UCLA, they have averaged 13.5 goals per contest, placing them among the best in the nation. Five starters have already recorded at least seven goals thus far, including leading scorer Forel Davies, who presently has 8 goals on the season — a significant improvement for a player who finished with just 19 a year ago. Such offensive balance makes stopping them an incredibly challenging task for opposing defenses.
Yet, while their strong performance thus far has left the Women of Troy pleased, they are nowhere near satisfied, as they head into their Saturday outing.
“We did a lot of things really well over the weekend,” said Anae. “But we also have a lot of things that we needed to work on that were exposed during the Stanford game. We’re thinking about the loss to Stanford and the things we need to work on.”
Provided that the Women of Troy can maintain their offensive prowess, and fine-tune some of their defensive issues, then look for USC to leave McDonald’s Swim Stadium with a victory in hand.
“We expect to play really good defense this weekend — it’s one of the things we’ve been working really hard on during practice,” Anae added. “It’s about communicating with each other and hustling.”

As the second half of Pac-10 play gets underway, the USC men’s basketball team (14-9, 6-5) finds itself with the chance to do what it has not done in six years — sweep UCLA in the regular season — and what it has never done — beat the Bruins at the Galen Center.
Tested · Senior forward Marcus Johnson and the USC men’s basketball team have seen the best offenses the Pac-10 has to offer, yet still rank fourth in the nation in team defense.  - Avi Kushlan | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans, coming off of home wins against California and Stanford, will close their three-game homestand against the struggling Bruins (11-12, 6-5), who have posted their worst record after 23 games since 2003-2004, which was UCLA coach Ben Howland’s first season with the team. Despite the discrepancy in non-conference records, the two teams are in a five-way tie for second place in the Pac-10 at 6-5.
While the Trojans rank dead last in the Pac-10 and 276th in the nation in offensive efficiency, they have continued to find success because of their defensive prowess, which ranks first in the conference and third in the nation.
“[Defense is] our calling card,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “We’re not built to be anything but a defensive team. When we don’t play at the top of our game defensively, we lose. [That is] our formula for winning. We don’t score well enough to have letdowns on defense. I can’t emphasize it enough.”
That defense will be tested against UCLA’s spread-out offensive attack; despite averaging only 66.8 points per game as a team — third-worst in the        Pac-10 — the Bruins are the only team in the conference to have all five starters average double figures in scoring. UCLA’s biggest threat offensively has come from its guard tandem of Michael Roll and Malcolm Lee, who average 13.6 and 12.3 points per game, respectively.
Yet, despite the balance, the Bruins have been unable to recapture the success of the past severla years and are in unfamiliar territory in the Pac-10. USC hopes to turn around a defense that struggled when the team traveled north earlier this season.
“When we get back on our defensive play, then we’re on the right track. It’s what we’re good at,” said senior guard Dwight Lewis.
The first matchup between the two teams this season came on Jan. 16 at Pauley Pavilion. Behind Lewis’ 24 points and sophomore forward Nikola Vucevic’s 19, the Trojans cruised to a 67-46 victory — their largest against UCLA since the 1944-1945 season and ever at Pauley Pavilion.
The Trojans did not let up defensively in the mid-January matchup, holding the Bruins to just 33-percent shooting and held the Bruins without a scorer above 12 points.
USC, despite not being eligible to play in the postseason because of self-imposed sanctions, still has an opportunity to win the Pac-10 regular season title. Both the Trojans and the Bruins sit one game behind first-place Cal, who traveled to Los Angeles to play the two teams last week. USC beat the Golden Bears 66-63 on Thursday night, while UCLA fell to Cal 72-58 on Saturday.

Tuesday, Feb. 9, 12:23 p.m. — four university vehicles, a cement truck in transit and thousands of students crowd the area between Tommy Trojan and the Von KleinSmid Center. Amid the uncharacteristic rain, passersby fill the air with incomprehensible chit-chat. Bikes whiz and swerve across the slick pavements, as a FedEx truck inches along at snail’s pace.
Daily Trojan | Julia Vann
Motor vehicles, electric vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians must all utilize the same transit corridors on USC’s campus. But there’s no reason they must all use them at the same time.
When developing urban streets, city planners often attempt to separate bicycles, motor vehicles and pedestrians. On campus, sidewalks, roads, bus lanes, truck routes and bikeways are all one in the same. Without any space on campus to distinguish between bikeways and driveways, the lone solution is to cut out one mode of transportation or another.
According to Undergraduate Student Government Campus Affairs Director Helen Moser, the university’s traffic safety task force is working on a solution to tackle this issue, though it has not finalized its recommendations.
To solve the congestion, the committee should highly consider a solution that bans everything but pedestrian and bicycle traffic during passing periods, the “20s” and “50s” of every hour between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. Such a proposal, however, is easier to imagine than to implement.
Bicycles alone pose a challenge. Since special bicycle driving licenses aren’t required, most students who ride their bicycles around campus aren’t informed of the proper rules and procedures, such as moving to the right in the face of oncoming traffic. And in a rush to get to class or work, speed and safety often become secondary concerns.
Students aren’t going to change poor habits if faced with inconsistent regulation. Just watch how effective the “Bike Ban” signs posted in front of the USC Pertusati Bookstore and Lyon Center are when no Department of Public Safety officer stands nearby yelling at those defying the ban. Even if a bicycle rider must dismount, the issue of congestion still isn’t resolved. Compared to an SUV, the amount of space occupied by a bicycle is negligible.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle mentioned a proposal to eliminate all vehicular traffic on campus. Such a move would require delivery trucks to operate on the perimeter of campus and move only between midnight and 6 a.m.
Campus safety would be significantly improved if there were fewer vehicles moving on campus during peak bicycle and pedestrian movement periods. Travel to class 10 minutes earlier than you normally would, and you’ll find the streets of USC filled with dozens of people instead of thousands.
If vehicles were limited to emergency travel during these peak periods of student movement, the congestion problem would be significantly resolved.
Additionally, the little white carts serving essential services such as transporting food and supplies can accomplish such tasks while students are in class. Students just need a few minutes every hour to ferry themselves around. All these other vehicles that keep the school operating will still be left with plenty of time to get themselves to their engagements.
Restricting traffic during peak periods of every hour during the day is the first step toward solving the traffic safety problem.
Until then, we’ll continue to feel the squeeze.

The Bike Ban signs are a joke, when placed at the 34th/McClintock intersection.  They also clearly state NO to motorized vehicles as well.  As long as motorized vehicles (this includes golf carts, according to the sign) are allowed to pass through, I will not dismount my bicycle.

Prevailing wisdom states that proficiency in multiple languages is an invaluable tool for experiences like studying abroad or perhaps making a good impression; Americans admire those who have managed to become fluent in at least one language other than English. But to others, like our European counterparts, being fluent in at least two languages other than their native tongue is commonplace. So why is that notion so foreign to Americans?
President Theodore Roosevelt once said, “We have room for but one language here, and that is the English language.”
As absurd and provincial as it might sound, it still resonates with many Americans today. Though we might try to pride ourselves on our cultured outlook, well-traveled backgrounds or ideals, our mind-set regarding learning languages hasn’t shifted much from Roosevelt’s. We still operate under the assumption that English is the sole lingua franca.
The Center for Applied Linguistics recently conducted a survey revealing that many schools have dropped foreign language instruction because public elementary and middle schools have largely ceased such programs.
Fundamentally, the education system roughly demonstrates the idea that there is no need to consider foreign languages in our everyday interactions. In fact, only 9 percent of Americans speak a foreign language, compared to 44 percent of Europeans.
Our education system has generally relegated the learning of a foreign language to the privileged, the college-bound or the less science-inclined, which tacitly asserts that knowing a foreign language is not a priority. Rather, it’s a necessary activity only for those studying or working abroad.
Although most schools in the United States do offer foreign language instruction — mainly in French and Spanish — it often begins late in a student’s career, by which time the brain is significantly less adept at absorbing a new language.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Interestingly enough, though most foreign language instruction in the United States is waning, interest in Chinese is on the rise. The proportion of elementary and high schools offering instruction in Chinese has increased four-fold within the past decade. In addition, the College Board reports that the Chinese Advanced Placement test is quickly surpassing German as the third most taken foreign language AP test.
Yet authors, linguists and educators are wary about the permanence of this sudden surge in learning Chinese in schools, especially kindergarten and elementary schools. It doesn’t take a genius to realize that Chinese is gaining popularity because China is quickly assuming a role as the United States’ greatest competitor. Students realize that having a working knowledge of Chinese will give them an advantage in the business world and for the myriad opportunities that are becoming increasingly available.
This is a case of déjà vu: Interest in learning Russian skyrocketed during the 1980s, before Japanese ran its course in the 1990s, and Arabic became popular after Sept. 11.
While American educators realize the benefits of learning a foreign language early in a child’s life, what about the rest of us? Will Americans really be convinced to learn Chinese and break the mind-set that English is the universal language?
At this point, it is unlikely Americans will make the necessary psychological shift to embrace knowing a foreign language as well as, say, basic algebra. As Susan Jacoby, author of The Age of American Unreason, said, “The fad for Chinese will pass — born, like the promotion of Russian studies during the Cold War, out of the idea that we must know the language of our chief competitor.”
Sadly enough, Jacoby’s prediction might be true, as our bias toward English and our complacence for genuinely embracing diversity have hindered us from becoming the true global citizens we emulate.

I think learning a second language is reasonable if one goes to a foregin country.
But lets get serious about learning things.
I was in Shiyan China in November of 2008.  What is needed in this nation is that the old people should start doing physical exercies like the Chinese I saw.  They were out there by the hundreds.
I saw some old guy getting off of a bus.  I wanted to ask his age but I was told it would be impolite.  I did not ask.

Terrence, the old guy’s age was 68.
I agree with Teddy and Rich. Learning a language is fun, and has been very enriching to my life, but it is not a priority or a necessity. Interestingly, I spent several semesters learning French and Japanese in high school and as a college student, never to really use either of them, but gained semi-fluency in Chinese after graduating, while I worked in China. Looking back, I think that wasting time on languages in schools was kind of a status symbol, something I was able to do because I wasn’t studying a “hard” subject like medicine or engineering. Frankly I wish I’d spent more of my undergrad years acquiring practical knowledge instead of “finding myself”, which is really just another word for putting off responsibility.
Teddy Roosevelt was a racist, and ironically the U.S. is considered the current Roman Empire. But we’ll see how long that lasts. I am patriotic, but not nationalistic. English was almost overturned by German as the official language in the early part of U.S. history. English should be the official language throughout the U.S. The founding fathers of MY country were “dead old white men.” Were these dead old white men myopic then? Absolutely, however, some traditions should persist, like–the English language!
The only reason Chinese language is on an upswing is because China’s recent rise in economic prowess. But alas, it’ll burst a la the Japanese economy. 
Enjoy your 15-minutes China, the world isn’t impressed by your shoddy, mass-produced merchandise.
america makes shoddy products too and at ten times the cost! American auto companies are certainly not competitive and electronics have had that same reputation for decades. maybe we make better financial products–on second thought those are shite too…hmmm at least we make better weapons of mass destruction!
Nadine, thanks for writing this article. It’s something more Americans need to hear, even though I agree that most of them probably will never see the value of learning a foreign language. You also could have included the statistic that less than a third of Americans even have passports and a great number have never even left their hometown. Not hard to see why they don’t think learning languages is important. 
@ Rich, your comments are as ignorant as Teddy Roosevelt’s. Since when did speaking another language make you less American? Have you forgotten that this country is a land of immigrants? Do you think the 44% of Europeans who speak another language consider themselves less nationalistic because of it? English is the official language of the US. So what? French is the official language of France and you’ll find lots of people there who speak other languages.
What are “other countries standards”? Furthermore, what are “American standards”? One of the things that makes America great is that it embraces people from everywhere and our culture is a hodgepodge. People who immigrate to America and then choose to isolate themselves within their own culture without integrating is one thing, but diversity is GOOD for America and sets a positive example for the rest of the world.
Teddy Rosevelt also said that we have no room for 50/50 pct Americanism in this country…what he is saying is that we need to protect our culture so we dont get overran by other cultures ala the Roman empire. You are eitther 100% American, or you are not an American at all, period. I agree with his sentiments, and we are seeing today that letting people live here by their contries standards is not a good thing for America. There still isnt any room for 50/50 Americanism, and Englisg IS the official language here. That being said, we need some to learn foreign languages, but the need to live in America as a bilingual citizen is really not needed to be successful.

Student access to an online campus food ordering system, safer tram stops, direct student involvement in sustainability and town hall-like meetings are just a few of the goals presidential candidate Chris Cheng and vice presidential candidate Nehi Ogbevoen said will help bring the “premier collegiate experience to USC.”
Making it happen · Presidential candidate Chris Cheng (right) and vice presidential candidate Nehi Ogbevoen have researched their propositions to ensure they can deliver on their promises. - Photo courtesy of Chris Cheng 
A junior majoring in international relations and a member of Pi Kappa Phi fraternity, Cheng is currently USG director of outreach and served as assistant director of communications last year. Ogbevoen, a junior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention and a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, is currently a member of the USG Academic Research Fund and is also involved in community service events and groups such as Dance Marathon and Troy Camp. Both candidates say they see USC through a wide lens because of their involvement in various activities.
“We think we can really connect to the majority of almost all Trojans, and that’s something we pride ourselves in — is being the most active candidates,” Cheng said.
One of their goals is reaching to the entire student body to hear different voices and opinions in organized town hall meetings every month. Town halls would cover issues such as housing, dining, financial aid, entertainment programming, academic research, academics and community service.
“We don’t feel like there is enough student input,” Cheng said. “A lot of the people in USG are great leaders, great minds, but it’s a 16,000 undergraduate student body, and we should hear from more than 30 people.”
The candidates plan to work to bring high profile speakers — like Lane Kiffin and Mike Garrett to the athletics meeting — to bring in a lot of student input.
Because USG is a lobbying organization, Cheng said he thinks it is also a great venue for individual students and student organizations to connect to the administration. If elected, the candidates would work on increasing USG’s transparency and encouraging collaboration between USG and student groups.
Off campus, Cheng and Ogbevoen are emphasizing student safety and reliable communication at tram stops in the North University Park area.
“People always complain about how there’s not enough lighting [at the tram stops]. They feel insecure, unsafe … People don’t use the trams because they don’t know when they are coming, so they focus on Campus Cruiser, which clogs the line,” Cheng said.
The candidates said they have confirmed with an administrator that digital clocks could be placed at stops. Because the trams are already connected to GPS, it wouldn’t be difficult to add these clocks to estimate the tram’s arrival times.
They are also hoping to cut down long dining lines at campus eateries. Ogbevoen said there is an online program they would like to introduce to USC where students can essentially order food online.
Academically, Ogbevoen said their focus on restoring and improving the variety of two-unit classes on campus would add options like rock climbing and culinary and graduate test prep classes.
They also plan to work with administrators to fix poor wireless signals in some areas of campus.
“I know I have problems all the time getting Wi-Fi connection in VKC, Taper [Hall], the dorms,” Ogbevoen said.
Both candidates want to see more student involvement in other arenas on campus, including sustainability. They hope to work directly with USC Sustainability Program Manager Matthew Oden to encourage students to go green.
“We really want to enhance the [sustainability] office and make it a true, permanent sustainability office that not only professionals get to work in [but also] student themselves,” Cheng said. “There would be committees with [Oden], kind of like a student government itself but just for the sustainability office.”
Moreover, Cheng said they plan to push a reusable-mug system that is currently being worked on with Trojan Grounds and Ground Zero Performance Café and other coffee shops on campus.
Leading up to the campaign period, Cheng and Ogbevoen, who are running with the campaign slogan, “Believe in us, and we’ll make it happen. Fight On!” said they worked hard to form an achievable platform.
“Not only did we meet with student leaders from student organizations, but we also met with administrators as well to see which of our goals were actually feasible,” Ogbevoen said.
Cheng added that they have been talking with students to see what kind of change they want to see and are combining that with input from administrators to determine what can actually be done.
“We don’t want to give [students] false hope, false promise and then get the position added to our résumé and move on,” Cheng said.
Campaign manager Alex Bozzo said the dynamic between the two candidates will bring a balance to USG.
“With Chris, you see this confident, exuberant energy and just really passionate guy … [which] is complemented nicely from Nehi, who is always composed when he speaks and garners attention of everyone in the room … There is that aura and presence about him that commands respect,” Bozzo said.

The Zipcar initiative launched by the City of Los Angeles in September has seen such unanticipated success — particularly around USC — that officials are considering expanding the program in the near future.
The Massachusetts-based Zipcar has partnered with more than 100 college campuses throughout the country, with 17 of which are in California. Members pay an annual fee of $35 to use the program, which allows them to rent cars from zipcar stations. Gas is included in both the daily and hourly rates, which start at $8, and the cars are available around the clock every day of the week.
Since the program was first implemented at USC three years ago, it has grown from just four cars to the second-largest Zipcar fleet in the country with 21 cars available for use, according to Associate Director of USC Transportation Jeff Shields. In September, more cars came to USC as part of a citywide pilot program.
The popularity of the Zipcar program has steadily climbed. City Councilman Bernard C. Parks, who was part of the effort to implement the Zipcar pilot programs in September, said its success was a pleasant surprise.
“It did not take a long period to familiarize people with the concept,” Parks said. “People instantaneously saw the benefit of it.”
Shields said the USC program currently has more than 1,000 members.
“As we continue to educate the campus community on the benefits of using Zipcar, we expect that number to increase,” he said.
USC Zipcars are being used anywhere from 50 to 60 percent of the time, Shields said. Even with the program’s popularity, Shields said members rarely have a hard time finding cars, and, with the addition of more cars to the fleet, the concern may soon be eliminated altogether.
Generally students say they use Zipcars to do errands, visit friends and explore the L.A. area. But the advantages of the program are not limited to convenient transportation. Parks said he believes the Zipcar program might eventually even alter the mind set that everyone must have their own car.
“The pilots have given the city a different concept on how [Zipcar] may be able to impact transit, the overabundance of cars in the city and the parking shortage, particularly in areas in which there are large numbers of people,” Parks said.
Students said they were excited that the program might be expanding.
“Zipcars are really convenient for running errands and going out with my friends, but, if I knew that I would be able to access a car more often, I would definitely take advantage of them more,” said Angela Beevers, a sophomore majoring in screenwriting.
So far, Beevers said she has not had a problem getting a car when she has wanted to go out, but the increase in cars could only increase her use of the Zipcar.
Some students who have not yet tried Zipcar said they would consider it, especially if the program expands.
“Over the past semester, I’ve heard a lot of good things about them, so I think that if they continue strengthening the program and increasing the number of cars, I would have to sign up,” said Martha Zimmermann, an undeclared freshman.
Zimmermann said she would like to have reliable transportation any time she needs it, without having to provide her own car.
“Coming to USC from Boston, I didn’t see the need to bring a car with me, but I do wish that I was able to drive off campus every so often,” she said. “With more Zipcars, I don’t think I would ever need to bring my car out here to the West Coast.”
Another noteworthy characteristic of the Zipcar program is its energy-efficient lineup of vehicles, including a selection of hybrids.
“It’s not just any car that is being driven,” Parks said. “They are basically all cars that are environmentally equipped.”
The next step for Zipcar at USC is to continually expand the program as the demand for cars increases.
“One of our goals is to provide as many affordable transportation options as possible to our students, faculty and staff,” Shields said. “Ultimately, we would love to host the largest Zipcar fleet in the country and [we] feel very strongly that we can reach that goal in the very near future if trends continue to stay the same.”

For students looking for a job after graduation, Thursday’s Career Fair offers one of the best opportunities to make contact with several employers in one afternoon. But some students might not even bother going to the Career Fair, focusing their efforts on pursuing graduate school rather than taking on the unwelcoming job market.
Recent reports indicate companies are not exercising their hiring function as enthusiastically as they once did. A Bureau of Labor Statistics report released earlier this week stated that employers cut 20,000 jobs in January, and other statistics showed that the number of long-term unemployed workers is at its highest rate since the government started keeping track in 1948.
Peter Giulioni, executive director of USC Marshall Keenan MBA Career Resource Center, confirmed that he’s seen a slow down in recruiting.
“We’ve experienced a pullback by our employers,” he said.
Students have also noticed the trend.
“I know the economy is recovering,” said Grace Kwok, a junior majoring in accounting, “but the job market is pretty saturated right now.”
Though she had initially hoped to enter the job market as an accountant next year, she said she is strongly considering applying to the Leventhal School of Accounting for graduate school instead.
Perlita Carillo, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, has already decided to get a master’s in public health at the USC Keck School of Medicine.
Both said they are uncertain about attending the fair.
“A lot of people tell me it’s mostly geared towards business majors, so I don’t know if it will be much help,” Kwok said. “I’ve found ConnectSC more useful than the fair.”
But Giulioni said it’s important for students to attend the fair to scout out opportunities.
“Every opportunity to encounter the hire function of companies should be utilized,” he said.
Though opportunities are disappearing in a variety of industries, the BLS report showed an increase in jobs in manufacturing, retail and health care, along with a significant increase in temporary-staffing jobs, which economists often point to as a predictor of a future increase in long-term jobs.
Courtney Brunious, a second-year graduate student studying business, said temporary employment is much more readily available than permanent employment.
“A lot of offers aren’t really for full-time positions, mostly internships that may turn into full-time positions,” he said.
As a result, career advisors counsel students to employ a number of strategies in job hunting.
“Cast a broader net in terms of the jobs [you] are pursuing … you can’t approach the job market with too much of a level of specificity,” Giulioni said.
Tim Burgess, director of Career Development for the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, agreed.
“Knowing what your transferable skills are is very important,” he said.
Both Burgess and Giulioni said that the number of students asking them for advice about graduate school seems to have increased as a result of the economic climate. Still, Giulioni emphasized that graduate school should not be seen simply as an escape from a challenging job market.
“Think about the opportunity that will give you the highest return on investment in terms of time, talent and treasure,” Giulioni said.
Burgess offered one last piece of advice in keeping with the age of social networking.
“You have to go beyond replying to job postings,” he said. “You have to develop a strong LinkedIn profile.”
Brunious echoed this thought.
“It’s all about networking — creating that relationship that allows you to get that opportunity,” she said.
Graduate school isn’t going to solve the problems of: increasing unemployment; jobs transferred overseas; technology making certain industries obsolete; ever-increasing competition; corporations getting caught for dishonest financial disclosure; people throughout the world saving instead of spending; banks reluctant to issue loans; a dearth of capital infusion; Chinese competition in the manufacturing sector; and this futile, “lip service” job fair.
Well, many of you (probaly most of you) voted for the current left-wing President and Congress who have spent the past three years destroying the economy and jobs. Those of you who did so should admit your error and, by way of apology, go home to live in your parents’ basement so that people who *didn’t* make your mistake will get to take what jobs you haven’t yet destroyed.

USC’s endowment had one of the largest losses among the nation’s top schools, according to a recently published report detailing university endowment figures for the last fiscal year.
The study, conducted by the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO), found that the endowments at universities nationwide lost an average of 18.7 percent in value. USC lost 25.6 percent in endowment funds — nearly 7 percent more than the national average. That 25.6 percent translated into a $1.2 billion loss between July 2008 and June 2009.
“The survey is in its 39th year, and this is the largest decline we’ve seen in its history,” NACUBO’s director of research and policy Kenneth Redd said.
USC ranked 22nd among the schools that suffered the worst endowment losses with Syracuse, Baylor College of Medicine, Harvard, Yale and Carnegie Mellon leading the pack.
USC was also ranked the 8th worst managed endowment by 24/7 Wall St., which based its rankings on absolute dollar gain and loss, percentage gain and loss and the greatest percentage and dollar gains and loses among the largest endowments.
“Just about every major institution with financial investments saw its endowment valuation go south,” Assistant Vice President for Media Relations James Grant wrote in an e-mail. “But the markets are rebounding, and we will continue to diversify our investment portfolio and seek to grow the endowment.”
USC administration has stated in the past that USC’s operating budget does not depend as much on its endowment’s returns as other schools, so, despite the loss, the university does not expect to see any major consequences to its budget.
Previously, USC had seen a steady increase in endowment funds because of the accumulating interest from various investments, ultimately leading to a high of $3.7 billion.
The endowment soon began to decline, showing the first traces of what would become a national recession and a worldwide market crash, falling from $3.6 billion in June 2008 to $2.4 billion by March 2009.
For schools that do rely heavily on their endowments, the drops can be catastrophic.
“Endowments are fairly important sources of revenue,” Redd said. “Fifteen to 20 percent of total operating budgets are from the endowment funds for many schools.”
Redd said endowments are especially important for financial aid and there have been schools that have cut financial aid from their budget.
“A lot of institutions have made commitments to financial aid plans,” he said. “They’ve had to cut back on financial aid and on outside administrative staff.”
Lawrence Picus, USC professor of education and finance, said USC has put a wise strategy in place to keep the school from feeling the consequences of a bad economy.
“We have a strategy to make sure that no one is badly hurt in bad times,” Picus said. “And we want to make sure we think wisely about how we spend our money when we have it.”
Robert Abeles, USC’s chief financial officer, has previously stated that the endowment loss would have a greater effect on the spending in the 2011 fiscal year than in the current year.
Redd noted that these drops, though frightening, are not necessarily cause for alarm.
“Endowments are supposed to last into perpetuity,” he said. “Campuses are not going to panic because of one bad year. You can make changes on campus, but the idea is to let the endowment grow in the future.”
Redd also said that, historically, stock has outpaced other forms of investment bonds, and, since most endowments are based on stock figures, there is a likelihood that endowments will grow in the near future.
“We can’t predict the future,” Redd said. “Certainly we think endowments will grow in the long run, but no one knows for sure what will happen.”
USC’s endowment has already grown since the end of the 2009 fiscal year; the endowment grew slightly to $2.5 billion in June.

After approaching the Undergraduate Student Government Senate on Tuesday in hopes of receiving $5,000 in funding, organizers of the Dance Marathon have been told their event cannot receive funding from any branch of USG. The group has other plans, however, to be sure the event goes off as planned.
Dance Marathon organizers had originally sought funding from USG’s discretionary funding board, which has contributed to the event in past years. They were turned down, however, because the funding board will not give money to events with an entry fee, and Dance Marathon’s registration cost was interpreted as an entry fee.
Short by about $8,000, organizers appealed to members of the Senate on Tuesday. After questioning and some debate, it was decided the Senate would vote on the request at its next meeting.
Once the Senate meeting ended, members of the two USG branches and representatives from Dance Marathon discussed the situation, and event organizers were told they would have to completely change their marketing strategy and apply through the discretionary board again.
The organizers were willing to take that step, said Scott Slesinger, co-executive director for Dance Marathon.
But on Wednesday, members of the legislative branch and members of the discretionary funding board met with their advisers and eventually decided they could not fund Dance Marathon at all.
“Ultimately, we cannot provide funding to fundraisers because the money we have in the budget comes from the student programming fee, and we can’t give money to any organization that hasn’t been approved by students,” USG Vice President Ashlie Chan said.
“It came down to the decision between both the Senate and discretionary funding board that USG cannot fund fundraisers no matter what, and there’s no way of getting around that,” Slesinger said.
Slesinger said Dance Marathon organizers understand the decision, though they were disappointed because the event has received funds from USG before.
“We weren’t trying to beat the system or anything, but USG is the only main funding source for organizations at USC, so, if your organization doesn’t fit, it’s really hard to get funding,” he said. “The thing that I’ve realized with USG is that every year it’s different depending on who the funding board director is. We did not change any of the marketing; our main strategies are all the same.”
Chan said the event might have received funding in the past because of the way it was presented to the discretionary funding board.
“It was presented as a free event last year,” she said.
Chan added that USG wanted to help but simply could not.
“We definitely wanted to fund this event … but, unfortunately, it goes against our principles,” she said.
USG’s decision is not the end of the road for the Dance Marathon, however.
Slesinger said the event had accumulated funds when it was being held at USC in the ’90s. This money will allow Dance Marathon to be held at the scale its organizers had hoped.
“It kind of freaked us out,” Slesinger said. “But we have kind of like a nest egg that’s kind of waiting for us. It’s money we’ve kind of been holding for something like this.”
Though some amenities will be sacrificed, such as a tarp to cover the floor of the gym where the event will be held, and some funds have been reallocated, Slesinger said attendees will not notice anything lacking.
As soon as this year’s Dance Marathon is over, organizers hope to meet with USG to determine how to avoid this situation in the future.
“Ashlie Chan has been incredibly supportive of our organization and our purpose. We’re planning on meeting with Ashlie and others in USG to figure out how we can restructure our campaign to be able to utilize USG funding in the future,” Slesinger said.
Chan said she is going to encourage the group to work out the logistics with the discretionary funding board before they apply for funding next year, so they can be sure all factors are considered.

Covering issues including sustainability, the surrounding community and academic schedules, the Undergraduate Student Government presidential debate Wednesday gave each presidential candidate the chance to better explain their platform to students.
Head-to-head · Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidates (left to right) Chris Cheng, Andrew Matson, Dylan Dann and Jonathan Munoz-Proulx discussed their platforms and stances on important issues at Wednesday night’s debate. - David Ji | Daily Trojan 
The debate was moderated by Kate Cagle, the executive producer of Annenberg T.V. News, Kate Mather, online editor for the Daily Trojan and Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics. The event, which ran about an hour and a half long, was attended by about 100 students, some of them wearing apparel and support buttons for the different candidates.
The candidates were asked specific questions based on their platforms. Each candidate was asked two questions and had a chance to give closing statements to reiterate their opinions.
The candidates shared similar opinions regarding improving the neighborhood around USC, agreeing that improved road paving and better leadership in terms of carrying out policies is needed.
“Our reputation is affected by what the surrounding area looks like,” said Dylan Dann, currently a Greek senator and one of the presidential candidates.
Candidates disagreed, however, when it came to issues about tuition.
Although the candidates agreed that lower tuition would not be a bad thing, opinions differed as to whether a change is necessary right now.
“Honestly, when students come into USC, you get what you’re paying for,” said Andrew Matson, currently the director of academic affairs and one of the presidential candidates. “One of my main goals is to make students more aware of scholarships, we really want to connect students better with USG.”
The candidates agreed that philanthropic events need to be expanded to encompass more students, beyond members of the Greek community. Some hoped to do this by uniting various smaller philanthropic groups.
“One improvement that could be made is the collaboration and communications between these different [community services] groups,”  said Jonathan Munoz-Proulx, one of the presidential candidates. “The money may be going to a different place but they are working towards a similar goal.”
The candidates all had different ideas as to how to improve sustainability, from providing more recycling bins to installing solar panels on different buildings.
“Being green should start before students even get on campus,” said Munoz-Proulx, who then outlined a plan to create a workshop during orientation to educate students about USC’s sustainability efforts.
One of the most important issues that was brought up during the debate was the feasibility of a longer Thanksgiving break. Many of the candidates voiced concerns about diminishing academic quality by removing instructional days.
“Academic days are set,” Chris Cheng, currently the director of external relations at USG and one of the presidential candidates, said. “We’ve talked to teachers and they like the way it is.”
Matson disagreed, saying he had actually gotten varying responses from faculty members, some of whom were open to changing the schedule.
Candidates also discussed a possible entertainment center on campus, including a bowling alley. The candidates all agreed that an on-campus entertainment center for students would improve safety by allowing students to stay on campus and would boost the quality of weekends on campus.
“USC doesn’t have a place where people can meet and hang out, and we want to provide more places on campus where students can be entertained,” Cheng said.
Some of the candidates, however, pointed out that there may be other, more pressing issues that deserve more immediate attention.
Overall, the candidates generally agreed that the issues facing students are similar, but each ticket had different plans to go about serving the needs of students.
“We all love the university here,” Cheng said. “We just want to make the university better.”
Schnur said the annual debate is an important opportunity for students to learn about the future of their university and its potential leaders.
“I thought it was tremendous,” Schnur said. “The candidates have very well-thought out platforms and they were also extremely well-prepared and presented very well.”
