Students and panelists gathered for the semester’s fourth installment of “Students Talk Back: A Politics and Public Policy Forum,” to discuss Russia’s recent efforts to annex the Crimea region of Ukraine and the role of U.S.  diplomacy in the conflict. 
The Students Talk Back series is a semimonthly forum presented in partnership with the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, the College Democrats, the College Republicans and the Daily Trojan.
The theme for the discussion was “The Crisis in Ukraine: Is US/European Diplomacy Enough?”
The forum was moderated by Yasmeen Serhan, editorial director of the Daily Trojan, and Kerstyn Olson, interim director of the Unruh Institute.
Olson began by stressing the importance of geopolitical issues for students in California who will soon be voting in midterm and national elections.
“Given that we are living in a very tried-and-true blue state, I think it’s important — especially in a midterm election year — for USC students to not only think about issues that are of great import to California voters, but what will be important to voters in the so-called swing states,” Olson said. “Foreign policy is, of course, of incredible importance to all voters.”
The moderators were joined on the panel by Rod Pacheco, a former state assemblyman and former district attorney of Riverside; Paul Feldman, an assistant foreign editor at the Los Angeles Times, and students Jessica Blakely and Shikhar Gupta.
The first topic of discussion dealt with the legality of the Crimean referendum, which, if approved, will potentially allow the Crimea region of Ukraine to become part of Russia.
“They don’t have a constitution that allows them to do this,” Pacheco said. “If there was a legal basis for the move, then Putin, Russia et. al. would have offered it, and the fact that they haven’t means they don’t have one.”
For Feldman, who has been with the Los Angeles Times for more than three decades, the lack of a legal basis is less important because no one will enforce it.
“It’s an issue more about real politics than legal basis, because there is no one that is going to be enforcing legal basis anyways,” he said. “It does appear right now that whatever happens, whoever puts up a fuss about the legal basis part probably is not going to get very far.”
Blakely, a senior majoring in international relations and global health, agreed.
“Paying attention to what the international law would say might not be one of Putin’s priorities either,” she said.
Gupta, a sophomore majoring in international relations, provided some historical background for the audience members less familiar with the crisis.
“[Ukraine] has historically been a part of various nations, empires, kingdoms and what not,” he said.
Citing the transfer of Crimea to Ukraine by then-First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Kruschev in 1954, Gupta discussed the resulting implication: Nearly 60 percent of Crimeans identify as Russian.
Pacheco, however, stressed the importance of Crimea as a military outpost.
“This is a very important strategic base for Russia — they have a major naval facility there, it is a warm water port, they can reach any point in the Middle East, anywhere throughout the Mediterranean,” he said. “That was the basis for them invading in the first place under Peter the Great.”
While the first half of the discussion focused on questions from the moderators, during the second half, audience members were invited to ask questions of the panelists.
Luke Phillips, a sophomore majoring in international relations, commented on the implications of the Ukraine crisis for the future of U.S. foreign policy.
“There is going to be a seat change in U.S. politics within the next decade, and I don’t think it’s going to come with a change in the administration,” Phillips said.
The next Students Talk Back is Wednesday, March 26, in the Forum at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center.

On Wednesday night, as part of a nationwide campaign to stop the use of the word “retarded” as a derogatory and insulting adjective, actor and National Down Syndrome Society ambassador John C. McGinley spoke to students in the Leavey Auditorium on how young Hollywood has the power to make a change through what they write and produce.
Change · Actor and advocate John C. McGinley spoke to students in Leavey Auditorium Wednesday night on ending the use of the R-word. – Austin Vogel | Daily Trojan
McGinley has been coming to USC for the past few years to speak about this campaign, known as “Spread the Word to End the Word,” in conjunction with Delta Kappa Alpha, the professional cinema fraternity.
The actor and advocate, best known for his role on the hit television show Scrubs, is actively involved in the campaign. Along with an interview on KDVR Fox 31’s “Everyday Dish,” McGinley published an article on March 4, a day before Spread the Word’s annual awareness day, in The Huffington Post entitled “What Really Happens When You Use the R-Word” in which he encourages the public to substitute kinder words for the R-word.
“Perhaps next time you feel compelled to use the words ‘retard,’ ‘retarded’ or the suffix ‘-tard?,’” wrote McGinley, “Stop. Just for a second. And see if sprinkling your language with love and compassion, doesn’t lead you to discovering a new, different and possibly better way of saying the exact same thing?”
McGinley encouraged students at the event to use his blogging and social media efforts as a model for how they should go about raising awareness. On the most basic level, McGinley encouraged students to — when they hear someone use the R-word — say to them, “Is there a better way to phrase what you just said?”
McGinley became interested in the movement 17 years ago, when his son Max was born with Down syndrome. Since then, he has been an active participant in a variety of movements to educate the public on Down syndrome and other conditions. He cited the Special Olympic games in particular.
“Some of the athletes [in the Special Olympics] are                       self-advocates, which I had never heard of,” McGinley said. “They’d stand up and it started to become a consensus in the room and then it started to get some momentum, and they decided they wanted to do something about it.”
One of McGinley’s missions is to have people equate the R-word with other derogatory words such as the N-word, so that it no longer becomes acceptable in everyday conversation.
“When we do use that language, there’s zero tax on it,” McGinley said. “If you go around disparaging Jews or blacks or gays or lesbians with disparaging language, there will be an expense, but with the “R-word,” our population can’t A) defend itself, and B) get back at you,” McGinley said.
Since becoming involved in the movement, McGinley has made a conscious effort to both not sign onto films that use the R-word and encourage directors and writers to take derogatory language out of their productions.
McGinley and the Special Olympic athletes, for instance, wrote a letter to political commentator Bill O’Reilly when he used the R-word on his show, and days later he publicly apologized for using it.
“The kids — they had moved the meters an inch,” McGinley said. “They had got a win [over O’Reilly].”
Kimberly Goldstein, a sophomore majoring in occupational therapy and psychology, said she tries not to use the R-word in her everyday vocabulary, and she also hopes to encourage friends not to use it as well.
“I always make a conscious effort [not to use the R-word] because I think it’s not a word that should be used,” Goldstein said. “But I will make a conscious effort to not have people use it as well so they can understand the magnitude of language in general.”
Greenwald writes a fine, sympathetic column here. She clearly understands that words can hurt. But she does not understand human nature. Unfortunately, outlawing a word does not change the meanness in people’s minds. When they think negatively about some group and want to express that, they will, choosing new words where necessary. An obvious example is the word “gay.” That is supposedly preferable to “homosexual,” actually a neutral term. So now I hear uncultured people saying “that’s gay!” to express their displeasure at some happening.
“Retarded?” “Retard?” Yes, these terms are used in contempt not only for those unfortunately born with low intelligence, but for those whom the speaker is criticizing for some action. So yes, you can call those with genuinely low intelligence “mentally challenged” or other euphemism, but this simply means that some people will begin to use “mentally challenged” instead of “retard.”
So what is my point? Easy. You can teach people the bad effects of hurtful terms, but you cannot outlaw those terms. Find better ways to change mean people into something better. Prohibiting language is not the way to do it.

Students gathered outside Tommy Trojan on Wednesday afternoon to raise awareness about violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo and to petition the university to release a statement against conflict minerals, which are mined under conditions of conflict or human rights abuse. The event was sponsored by Jewish World Watch  and the Political Student Assembly and organized by USC STAND Against Genocide.
Conflict-Free ’SC · Sophia Geanacopoulos, a sophomore majoring in international relations, paints a banner during the “Come Out for Congo” rally, which took place on Wednesday, March 12, in Hahn Plaza. – Hailey Sayegh | Daily Trojan
Ethnic tensions and violence over land disputes have been responsible for the uprooting of millions of lives in the Congo region for decades, yet details about the scope and depth of the conflict are still unknown to the general public.
“There is still a serious gap between the severity of the conflict and the knowledge that we have about it here,” said Francesca Bessey, the administrative director of USC STAND. “A lot of people simply don’t know that there is a conflict, that millions of people have been killed either through violence or displacement.”
Bessey said the goal of the petition was not to shame companies, but was instead meant as “positive reinforcement” to encourage companies to be aware of the conflict and their actions shaping it. The petition asks USC to release a statement certifying that the campus is conflict mineral-free as well as to express support for the conflict-free business initiatives already underway.
“Our unique power is that we are students at universities, which are big name consumers and investors, so we do have influence over the business world, particularly if this happens in conjugation with other universities,” she said.
Students at the rally said it was important for people to be aware of the issue so that they could be more mindful about the statement their purchases were making.
“Consumers are indirectly helping fund this conflict, so it’s not like other international issues where you feel like you can’t do that much — your purchasing choices have a direct influence,” said Erica Behrens, a sophomore majoring in international relations.
Not all students, however, were supportive of the rally’s efforts. Sneha Chug, a freshman majoring in business administration who travels frequently to the DRC, warned against making sweeping generalizations about the Congo, saying that such blanket statements cloud the issue and hurt indigenous business. She stressed the conflict is mostly limited to the eastern region of the country, where a shared border with Rwanda has created tensions that frequently result in violence.
“The issue is that around the world they are declaring the entire country, and preventing trade with the entire country,” Chug said. “So essentially you’re hurting the north, south, west and central portions of the country.”
Chug also said that though there are illegitimate mining operations in the country, there are also legal operations that provide gainful employment that are being hurt by negative press and sanctions arising from the labeling of the country as a conflict zone.
“I have no problem with increasing accountability, but with an understanding that increased accountability leads to either increased costs or corruption,” she said.
Bessey said that USC STAND is not advocating a boycott of all mineral imports from the Congo, but rather a redirectment of foreign investment away from conflict mines to legitimate operations so that the people of the Congo get a share of the wealth generated from their natural resources.
She said several organizations in the DRC have been working to establish and implement a certification process for mines to determine which are legitimate and conflict-free. Investment could then be directed toward these mines, ensuring that business remains within the DRC.
“The problem is that the legitimate businesses don’t have financial support right now, because many companies are still in business with the warlords,” Bessey said. “This may increase costs in the short term, but once violence stops being profitable, the market will correct itself.”

Dear Editor,
Yesterday the Daily Trojan printed two stories about Palestinian Awareness Week on their front page. We feel these stories are a misrepresentation of the facts in the Middle East and do not reflect the student body and its diversity of opinions on our campus. We are concerned that front-page coverage of an event attended by eleven people, with a speaker who is known for bashing Israel is poor judgment on the Daily Trojan’s part. Following the Daily Trojan’s failure to report on a panel regarding economic development in the West Bank held just two weeks ago, which was attended by 220 people, we find this bias in reporting disturbing,
SC Students for Israel has repeatedly made itself available for comment and were not contacted in regards to these stories. As the primary publication on campus, it is the Daily Trojan‘s responsibility to engage in proper diligence in reporting, regardless of the subject. If the staff is unable to find someone to represent the other side of an issue, they should abstain from printing the story.
The article regarding David Sheen’s speech in the March 11th issue was hastily prepared, which is evident by the typos and lack of representation of differing points of view. We ask that in the future, more time and effort be put into such political stories, especially when they are so prominently featured.
We expect more from an award-winning college paper representing more than 300,000 of the most diverse students and alumni in the U.S. We would hope that the USC Daily Trojan would uphold the fundamental principles of journalism, which include objectivity and fairness. We expect the entire Daily Trojan staff to make a more honest effort in trying to cover both sides of the story and prevent the kind of biased coverage seen in Tuesday’s issue. We understand that these publication decisions may not have been made with intention, and we would like the opportunity to meet with your staff so there is better understanding of what could be done in the future to represent a more balanced view of political issues in the Middle East.
Thank you,
SC Students for Israel

Editor’s Note: Yesterday, the Daily Trojan ran feature art of USC’s Student for Justice in Palestine’s “mock apartheid wall” and one story on an event hosted by SJP as part of their annual Palestine Awareness Week.
The event coverage included in the Daily Trojan do not reflect the opinions of the Daily Trojan, the university faculty or the student body. Like all news articles, event coverage only goes to reflect the points of view of the speakers or individuals involved. We have a policy of not commenting on the content of events because we do not take stances on such issues. Our opinion content is left to the opinion section, and the opinions expressed in those pieces are the opinions of the respective writers, and do not reflect those of the Daily Trojan, the university’s faculty or student body.
We welcome any and all dialogue that promotes a better understanding of all global conflicts, including those in the Middle East. We will continue to publish event coverage that reflects what is currently taking place on our campus, as we have done throughout our 101-year history. We covered SJP’s event in the way we saw to be most impartial without placing any value judgment.
Respectfully,
Yasmeen Serhan
Editorial Director, Daily Trojan
What un-mitigated gall these authors have: to paraphrase:
“If you cannot  check with us first, don’t write the story because we want to first edit it to our liking, Before it goes to Print”.
I thought bullying was outlawed at USC. What a ham-handed threat from a bunch of thugs.
The above authors cite nothing in this film or in this lecture as being inaccurate. I attended; it is accurate.
This is the problem, apparently: the accurate portrayal of the current situation in Israel/Palestine.
It is just childish entitlement when they state the article “Misrepresents the Student Body and it’s Diversity of Opinions”. There is no article that can possibly represent the all opinions carried by all students at USC. When is the last time SC Students for Israel asked the DT to get the Palestinian rebuttal.
Frankly, I am stunned that the DT printed this bold-faced attempt at forcing your values as a journalist. So, next time, be sure to call the SC Students for Israel to get their permission before you publish anything contrary to what Israel wants us to see.
I have a suggestion, how about we get this group into the offices and explain the freedom of the press laws to them. After all, it is the freedom of the press that assures our freedom from tyranny more than anything. 
We do not bow to tyrants and this letter is from a group of desperate tyrants trying to hide the truth of the matter.
This complete and utter intolerance towards others is completely humiliating to Israelis with a conscience. 
Open your minds look at what’s happening in Palestine and tell me it’s okay with you.
Now SC Students for Israel a.k.a. Hillel, which is a professional lobbying organization run by paid agents of AIPAC, (this is a fact) wants to control the press of USC.
I say go to Washington if you want to use your strong arm tactics; they are not wanted here  at USC.
There is no official censorship of the Press in the USA, but there is in Israel. Hoooray for the USA and freedom of speech and press!
Boy,
The Israeli lobby is alive and kicking at USC. 
The truth obviously hurts their image and thus, they protest. It is not the responsibility of the University/DT to check-in with the local Israeli lobby (Hillel/AIPAC) when issues of the Middle East arise. I am sorry but Hillel is not the go-to, indispensable partner to USC on all things Middle East; other points of view are and should be valued and allowed a voice. 
Congratulations to the DT for printing the news

The No. 2 USC women’s sand volleyball team will have its first home match against CSU Bakersfield today at Merle Norman Stadium at 4 p.m. The Women of Troy (1-1) will head into their home opener against the Roadrunners (1-1) having defeated Cal State Northridge last weekend, 5-0, before falling to top-ranked Pepperdine, 0-5.
Against CSUN last weekend, senior Kirby Burnham and freshman Sara Hughes won big on court one, posting a 21-11 score in both sets. Not far behind on court two, freshman Kelly Claes and sophomore Alexa Strange topped Marissa Boyd and Casey Hinger of Northridge, 21-11, 21-17. The same story continued on courts three and four where junior Eve Ettinger and senior Brooke Fournier dominated their opponents, 21-5, 21-8, and freshman Allie Wheeler and junior Bria Russ won 21-12, 21-17.
Unfortunately, the dynamic duos for USC could not continue their winning ways as Pepperdine clinched its 36th all-time victory  compared to only one loss. Pepperdine’s win was also its sixth straight victory over the Women of Troy through two seasons.
Only one USC pair was able to win a set against the Waves, as Wheeler and freshman Nicolette Martin took it to three sets against Pepperdine’s Sophie Asprey and Victoria Adelhelm.
Cal State Bakersfield will travel to USC after suffering a 3-2 loss to UCLA and picking up a 5-0 victory over Irvine Valley College. CSUB’s No. 2 team of Mariah Alvidrez and Shayna Guitare took home two victories on the day, as did the tandem of Danika Youngblood and Sara Little.
USC head coach Anna Collier is heading into the weekend with some confidence in her team and some specific goals in mind.
“We need to work on hustle,” Collier said. “I want to play what I like to call ‘SC volleyball’ — really aggressive, hard volleyball … I think we’re ready. We can’t worry about the score, we just want to compete and play the kind of ball we know we can.”
The ultimate goal for Collier and her team is to sweep their opponent by playing the way they have been competing at practices. Seniors Burnham, Fournier and Sam Hirschmann have some great goals for their team as they tap into their final season here at USC.
Fournier expressed a few of her goals for these three upcoming matches by talking about some of the specific aspects of the game she and her team have been attempting to master.
“I’m really looking forward to having everyone come out and watch us this weekend,” Fournier said. “It will be fun to have all of the students and other athletes come and watch the kickoff to our season.”
The feeling of excitement is a common theme throughout the roster and coaching staff of the USC sand volleyball team as they prepare for their first homestand. The Women of Troy will be facing three tough opponents, including CSU Bakersfield, No. 4 Florida State and Loyola Marymount.
USC will face off against Florida State at 12:30 p.m. on Friday, and following that match they will play Loyola Marymount at 2 p.m. The Trojans have never beaten Florida State, and it would be an incredible accomplishment if they could break their losing streak against the Seminoles and tally a win.
USC’s action-packed weekend kicks off today at Merle Norman Stadium at 4 p.m.

USC men’s basketball season is, mercifully, over. Your 2013-2014 Trojan squad went 11-21, which isn’t completely terrible, and 2-16 in conference play, which is completely terrible (those figures count Wednesday’s 59-56 loss to Colorado in the first round of the Pac-12 Tournament). Somehow, it’s not even the Trojans’ worst season in the last three years, as USC’s 2011-2012 team went 6-26, and 1-17 in conference play.
Big finish · Senior center Omar Oraby ended his career at USC yesterday with 10 points, seven rebounds and three blocks in a loss to Colorado. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
To be fair, this USC team was not as terrible as its exceptionally terrible record. If you happened to catch Wednesday’s loss to the Buffaloes, you watched a surprisingly close game — USC actually had a game-tying three-point attempt go begging at the buzzer.
All year, the Trojans have shown that they have the raw talent to remain competitive with most teams, but lack the experience to put a complete game together. In fact, 10 of their 17 losses in Pac-12 play came by 10 points or less.
This was, of course, the Trojans’ first year under head coach Andy Enfield, hired last year after he and his former Florida Gulf Coast team captivated the nation with their run to the Sweet 16 — not to mention their high-flying dunks and downright exciting style of play, earning them the nickname “Dunk City.”
Though never considered a reasonable expectation, the hope was that Enfield would come to Troy and instill the “Dunk City” mindset over at Galen Center. But one glance at the mess of a roster he inherited made it apparent that that would be impossible — at least for this year. Try as they might to run the court, USC games inevitably grinded to a slow halt, a steady “clank” of bricks hitting the Trojan basket.
By the end of the season, commentators on USC basketball games were noting that it was, in fact, the Trojans’ opponents who were trying to up the tempo of the game.
No one expected USC to legitimately contend this year, but few could have predicted the Trojans being as bad as they were. Perhaps an appropriate prediction would have been “competitive” — obviously that did not come to fruition.
So what will the case be next year? Disappointingly below already low expectations for yet another year?
Obviously it’s way too early to render a judgment on Enfield, but it’s hard to say year one was a step in the right direction. What if next year is exactly like this year was supposed to be? Better than this year, certainly, but still not real progress.
Honestly, the question creeps into my mind as to whether USC basketball is even worth caring about. It is still regarded as the No. 2 sport at this school, although these past few seasons prove it certainly doesn’t deserve to be.
In my four seasons here, the Trojans have lost an astounding 80 games (out of 130, good — or bad — for a .385 winning percentage). And that includes a trip to the opening round of the NCAA Tournament in 2011, where an eventual Final Four team (Virginia Commonwealth) blew them out.
With incoming freshmen Jordan McLaughlin and Malik Price-Martin, Enfield and the Trojans bring in two of the program’s higher-profile recruits since DeMar DeRozan back in 2008. Both are four-star recruits — but then again, so was guard J.T. Terrell, who scored a mere five points in his last game as a Trojan on Wednesday.
There is a culture of losing around USC basketball, so it makes sense that Enfield is trying to bring in a fresh roster and a fresh start. Next year will be the first time the roster actually has his handprints on it.
We’ll see how it turns out.

After the USC women’s basketball team captured the nation’s attention with its incredible Pac-12 championship run last weekend, first-year head coach Andy Enfield and his men’s basketball team had their sights set on replicating the women’s  performance. The 12th-seeded Trojans kicked off their Pac-12 Tournament in Las Vegas in a first-round matchup with the fifth-seeded Colorado Buffaloes at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Wednesday, but ultimately lost, 59-56.
Bowing out · Junior guard Byron Wesley scored a game-high 23 points in USC’s loss to Colorado, which knocked USC out of the Pac-12 Tournament. – Ricardo Galvez | Daily Trojan
The Trojans (11-21, 2-16) entered the contest with just two wins since January, and two losses to the Buffaloes (21-10, 10-8). In the first meeting between the teams in Boulder, the Buffaloes trampled the Trojans 83-62. The second meeting showed a different score, but the same result. USC suffered a tight 83-74 loss in front of the Trojan faithful at the Galen Center in mid-February.
On Wednesday, USC surprised the Buffaloes early, jumping out to a quick 4-0 lead at the hand of senior center Omar Oraby’s spinning post moves. But this advantage was quickly erased after a number of missed open looks.
Despite Enfield’s deep rotation with his bench, Oraby and junior guard Byron Wesley accounted for 16 of the first 18 Trojan points — eight points each — as Colorado climbed ahead to a 23-18 lead nearing the end of the first half.
As Colorado fans began to make their presence heard, senior guard J.T. Terrell swung momentum back into USC’s favor with a deep three-pointer. But a circus-shot layup by Wesley was off-target, ,leading to an uncontested Colorado alley-oop.
Coming out of the locker room at halftime trailing 29-27, the Trojans did not lose any intensity in the second half as they seemed to several times earlier in the season.
Through great interior defensive play by the entire USC squad, the Cardinal and Gold were temporarily able to hold onto control. When the team got in foul trouble, however, Enfield was forced to take defensive dominator Oraby out. Oraby picked up his fourth personal foul with seven minutes to go in the game.
“I was just trying to be physical with them and push them out, not letting them catch the ball deep,” Oraby said. “At the end, I got into foul trouble so I was trying to stay out of foul trouble and stay in the game.”
During his absence, the Trojans failed to convert a field goal for almost six minutes until Wesley once again absorbed contact at the rim and flushed in a difficult lay-up to close the gap to six points.
“We have to make open shots, and sometimes we’d go into stretches where we just missed wide open threes or we missed two transition lay-ups and a paint touch, so that’s the frustrating part,” Enfield said. “Our guys get frustrated because they know they’re playing pretty well, they just don’t make the shot. That’s what happened tonight.”
With under a minute to play, Wesley drove to the basket and finished inside, cutting the Colorado lead to three.
With 47 ticks remaining on the clock and in the Trojans’ season, Enfield commanded his team not to foul.
As the shot clock was about to expire, Colorado’s Xavier Talton launched an off-balance three that ricocheted off the right side of the rim. Frantically chasing after it, teammate Askia Booker claimed control of the offensive rebound. Falling out of bounds, Booker bounced the ball off of USC freshman guard Julian Jacobs’ leg, retaining possession for the Buffaloes with 11 seconds in regulation.
After a quick timeout, Colorado’s Josh Scott appeared to have an easy layup to seal the victory, but Jacobs, looking to make up for his previous mistake, had a different plan. The 6-foot-3 Las Vegas native met Scott at the rim, denying his shot off the glass. After a scuffle on the floor, the Trojans gained control of the ball.
Senior guard Pe’Shon Howard led the transition, dishing out a pretty pass to the hot-handed Wesley. Catching the ball in stride, Wesley released the ball as the final horn sounded. The game-tying shot fell just short, hitting off the front of the rim.
“Byron made every play that we needed from him the whole game, so I figured, ‘Why not let him finish it up?’ He had a running start,” Howard said. “It was a deep shot, but I thought it was good when it left his hand.”
Wesley finished the game with 23 points in 37 minutes, while Colorado’s Booker posted 21 in as many minutes.
Despite a disappointing final record, Enfield is pleased with his team’s performance this season and optimistic about the program’s future.
“I’m very appreciative of how hard the seniors that will not be here next year worked,” Enfield said. “They’ll have some great opportunities in a variety of different things, whether it’s to continue their basketball career or in the business world. But for those returning and for those recruits coming in, we’re very, very excited.”

USC’s NFL hopefuls participated in Pro Day at Cromwell Field on Wednesday, as 21 Trojans hoped to impress scouts from every NFL team two months ahead of the league’s draft in May.  
Circus show · Star wide receiver Marqise Lee, who is projected as a first-round draft pick, did not run a 40-yard dash on Pro Day, but participated in multiple sprinting and catching drills for a swarm of scouts. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Wide receiver Marqise Lee, a projected first-round pick, attracted the largest contingent of followers despite electing not to run the 40-yard dash. Lee previously ran the drill in 4.52 seconds, an average time for wideouts, at the NFL Combine in February.
Lee did participate in other agility drills and also caught passes from former walk-on quarterback Emon Saee, only missing one of 10 throws on the passing route tree after slipping while making a cut. Lee also bench-pressed 225 lbs. 11 times.
“The main things I tried to focus on was my position drills,” Lee said. “Getting in and out of my breaks, catching the ball no matter where it is, and just showing them that I still have it in me.”
Lee said that even though his 40-yard dash time at the combine wasn’t as fast as he would have liked, he is satisfied with the overall package he’s presented to NFL teams over the last month.
“I didn’t run the 40-yard dash like I wanted to, but at the end of the day, it still stuck to where it was a decent time,” Lee said. “You have to understand, running on film is different than the 40. I know my actual running on film will make up for the time I didn’t get … If I had to give myself a grade out of everything, I’d give myself, like, a B-plus.”
A few other Trojans might not have been as pleased with their performances.
Defensive end/linebacker Morgan Breslin clocked in a satisfactory 40-yard dash time of 4.75 seconds on his first attempt, but visibly tweaked what appeared to be his left groin on his second run before finishing in 4.95 seconds.
Running back Silas Redd sat out all running and agility drills because of a right knee injury. It was unclear if that was the same nagging ailment that sidelined him for a large part of last season.
Tight end Xavier Grimble might have done himself a favor had he elected to sit out some drills. Instead, he posted a time of 5.02 seconds in the 40-yard dash, far worse than the average NFL tight end — and it hardly looked that fast. He also failed to catch up to several long throws in passing drills, though that might have been a result of timing issues with walk-on Saee under center.
Instead, tight end Kevin Greene, who played most of his collegiate snaps on the defensive line before injuries to Grimble and redshirt junior Randall Telfer forced a position switch last season, appeared to be the more promising prospect. Greene recorded the fastest 40-yard time of the day (4.54), outrunning several wide receivers and defensive backs, and showcased soft hands and surprising route-running skills in passing drills. Still, it would take quite a leap of faith for an NFL team to draft such a raw prospect.
Guard John Martinez benched 225 lbs. 42 times, which tied the highest mark at the NFL Combine by North Carolina guard Russell Bodine. But Martinez, who had an extremely disappointing 2013 campaign while splitting time with junior Aundrey Walker, will still likely have to catch on with an NFL team as an undrafted free agent.
Cornerback Torin Harris, also considered a borderline NFL prospect, turned in an impressive vertical jump of 41 inches, but a poor 40-yard dash time of 4.66.
Defensive lineman George Uko raised questions about his mid-round draft status after logging only 18 bench reps of 225 lbs. at the NFL Combine, but slightly improved on that performance Wednesday with 22 reps.
Now, with only individual private workouts with teams to look forward to, USC’s NFL prospects can go back to honing their football-specific skills instead of focusing on drills intended to gauge their athleticism.
“We did a lot of preparation for the 40, the vertical jump, the bench,” Lee said, referring to his personal points of emphasis. “So now it’s back to doing straight football work again.”
Good luck to all SC players headed for the draft!

Roger Ebert could not conceive of a world in which video games were considered art.
In response to a spirited online debate over his review of the 2005 film version of Doom, an admittedly brainless sci-fi shoot-‘em-up film starring Dwayne Johnson, the legendary film critic called out the entire medium: “To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic.”

Ebert’s argument, of course, hinges on how one defines art. Does art represent an imitation of nature, or a transcendence of it? Is it possible to interact with art, or can it only be observed? If a book, song or painting engages you on a deeply emotional level — moving you to tears, making you laugh hysterically or even frightening you enough to produce nightmares — is that enough to qualify that object as art? If we can’t settle on a working definition, perhaps the meaning of art is inherently subjective and should rest with the aesthetic judgment of the individual attempting to relate to it. Or maybe not. As the old saying goes, “There’s no accounting for taste.”
Modern video games are a unique medium because of their dual nature: They contain both gameplay mechanics and dramatic elements that allow players to act as emotional participants, analytical puzzle solvers, obsessive trophy winners or all of the above. Anyone attempting to champion a video game’s artistic merits, however, would do well to consider this question: Is your emotional attachment derived from the gameplay itself, or from the game’s cutscenes, which often boast superior production value and more cinematic storytelling? If it’s the latter, then what you’re responding to is a movie, not a video game.
One of the best examples of this phenomenon is the announcement trailer for Techland’s 2011 zombie shooter Dead Island. The three-minute teaser, which plays in reverse, opens with the violent demise of a child zombie who gradually reverts back to the little girl she once was, taking us to the final seconds before she’s mauled by a horde of ravenous ghouls. The non-linear nature of the sequence adds a tragic sense of inevitability to the horror on display.
YouTube was soon flooded with comments from viewers who proudly admitted to shedding tears while watching the video, with many saying they couldn’t believe they had been so affected by a video game. There were just a few problems: 1) The trailer featured no actual gameplay. 2) The doomed little girl and her family don’t appear in the finished game. 3) It wasn’t even animated by Techland, who farmed out the job to a Scottish studio called Axis Animation. The ad, which went on to win the Gold Award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, succeeds as a beautifully composed short film but falls utterly short as an accurate depiction of the game itself.
Philosophical quibbles aside, there are a number of video games with legitimate claims to artistic merit. The first sign of the medium’s intent to mature was Shadow of the Colossus for Sony’s PlayStation 2, a very dark spin on the classic damsel in distress story that saw its young hero reduced to a horned monstrosity by the end of the final level. More recent examples include the cinema-quality mystery thriller Gone Home, the stark morality play Heavy Rain, the globetrotting serial adventure Uncharted, the immersive crime saga Grand Theft Auto V and the visually dazzling, thematically challenging BioShock series.
The industry’s breakthrough moment, however, arrived last summer in the form of Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us, a survivalist game that puts the player in control of the gun-toting Joel, portrayed by Troy Baker — the same voice actor who took over for Mark Hamill as The Joker in last year’s Batman: Arkham Origins. Joel is tasked with delivering Ellie, voiced and motion-captured by Ashley Johnson, into the protection of a resistance group who believes the young girl holds the key to curing the fungal infection that nearly wiped out humanity. Despite its familiar trappings — the comparisons to Cormac McCarthy’s book The Road are inescapable — the game emerged as both a commercial success and a critical darling, full of haunting visuals and rich, complex performances from Baker and Johnson.
Last week, Sony Pictures announced that it’s developing a big screen adaptation of The Last of Us. Screen Gems has picked up the distribution rights, and the film will be released under Sam Raimi’s Ghost House Pictures banner. Even though the game’s creative director, Neil Druckmann, is reportedly writing the script, many gamers are worried that a cinematic cash-grab will hurt the original’s reputation. Their concern is well-founded. From the profitable but mind-numbing Tomb Raider and Resident Evil franchises to full-blown catastrophes such as Max Payne and Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, there hasn’t been a single quality motion picture based on a video game. Christophe Gans’ 2006 version of Silent Hill came the closest, but the film’s often-dodgy CGI threw off its creep factor.
Despite the stigma of video game adaptations, a few upcoming projects have the potential to reverse the curse. This month’s Need for Speed, starring Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul and Dominic Cooper, looks like a premium cheddar action movie in the vein of the last two Fast and Furious flicks. Michael Fassbender, meanwhile, has been attached to Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed for a while now, and though the film hasn’t found a director yet, it’s already eyeing a 2015 release date. Director Duncan Jones, the ambitious young filmmaker behind Moon and Source Code, is busy prepping a movie version of the role-playing game Warcraft for March 2016. Gore Verbinski, the visual virtuoso behind Rango and the original Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, was on the cusp of finally making his BioShock film, but The Lone Ranger’s dismal box office returns appear to have sunk that dream, at least for the time being.
So, how will The Last of Us translate to the big screen? Will the stories and characters fans fell in love with survive the jump into a non-interactive environment? Until the leads are cast and a director is announced, it’s hard to say. If the film does well, it will be considered a huge step forward, another milestone on the long and arduous road to artistic legitimacy. If it doesn’t, gamers everywhere will be left wishing for a real-life reset button.

Freshman year: For most students, it’s the time to make new friends, settle in and explore Los Angeles. Many might join clubs, participate in Greek Life or student government and maybe even volunteer. But there is at least one freshman that destroys the norm of being a passive 18-year-old. 
Freshman international relations major Maya Carter has built the foundation for a nationwide movement, Motivate and Empower, or more simply, M&E. As an observant USC student, Carter noticed social issues pertaining to socioeconomic status, gender inequality and an overall apathy among the student body. So she decided to become the catalyst for change.
“I was shocked to find that there was no medium for a diverse group to come together and share unique ideas with one another,” Carter said. “There was no medium for evolution of diverse thought. Complex issues like the social issues we see today can’t be solved by one way of thinking.”
Carter said she aims to create an environment that is safe for everyone — no matter one’s background — to express thoughts and identity. She is building a culture of mutual respect while breaking down stereotypes and judgment.
Carter said she has a specific vision for the M&E movement: It will bring motivational speakers to campus to inspire “Campus Conversations,” which are facilitated discussions about social issues. M&E will then take those discussion participants and provide them with the opportunity to become a mentor for L.A. public school students.
“It is my hope that these motivational speakers will inspire USC students to speak up, and it is our responsibility to provide the medium for them to be heard,” Carter said. “In the future, we are bringing in Elizabeth Hunter, Hollywood producer and writer, and she hopes to discuss with our members gender and racial inequities in the film industry. She will be the first of many motivational speakers that will inspire the campus conversations that Motivate and Empower will facilitate.”
Carter said she hopes to facilitate a positive relationship with the L.A. community through outreach mentorship programs facilitated by M&E leaders. This mentorship program caters to the passion of USC students and provides them with the medium to share their passion with the L.A. public school system.
“M&E Leaders will apply to become one-one-one mentors with students in the L.A. public school systems,” Carter said. “There is something in this mentorship program for everyone. If you like poetry, teach poetry. If you are good at math, tutor in math.”
The movement is catching wind nationwide. Though M&E has found its roots at USC, it has big plans to spread to high schools and other universities. There are already potential members in more than 16 accredited colleges, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Tufts University and Wake Forest University. With more than 300 potential members, this movement is on its way to inspiring more than just college students.
Carter said she has partnered with Alex Fairman of USC’s Joint Education Project, which allows students to combine academic coursework with experiences in the surrounding community, and has established a network with 15 nearby public schools.
The movement’s message of motivating students to empower their immediate environment is an easy one to grasp and understand — and it is just as easy to join because it is all online.
“I took the initiative to join because I realized how proactive my peers were in wanting to solve the issues on campus,” said Alexis Cotton, creative director of M&E. “So I couldn’t help but feel motivated to do the same. I used my passion to design to help the movement by branding the movement, from the logo to the website.”
Though Carter might serve as an inspiration to her peers, she said she is just as humble and grateful for the inspiration she receives from her friends.
“I am so honored to see that my vision is being accepted by so many different people, who you would not assume would have anything in common,” Carter said. “We all realize what we have in common is that we all want to be motivated. And somewhere deep within us, we want to motivate others. M&E has something for everyone, so join the movement and see what you can do for M&E and what we can do for you.”
Thank you for a great article Priscilla. The response has been great and I’m honored to be spoken of in this light!

‘Make it work’ · Project Runway’s Michael Costello’s new sexy and sophisticated collections graced to the runway at Style Fashion Week. – Fehbe Meza| Daily Trojan
Los Angeles fashion insiders descended upon L.A. Live on March 10th, to watch Project Runway alumnus Michael Costello’s breathtaking fall/winter 2014 collections during Style Fashion Week.
Costello has been a regular at San Diego Fashion Week and has recently garnered even more attention for designing the sheer lace dress Beyoncé wore at this year’s GRAMMY Awards. He presented both his ready-to-wear and his couture lines at Style Fashion Week.
The Costello woman is not afraid of a little more fabric or more sequins or folds in unexpected places. She is the woman in the room who radiates confidence and does not let the dress wear her. She has everyone asking, “Who is she, and, more importantly, who is she wearing?”
Costello’s ready-to-wear collection was an impressive mixture of sexy and sophisticated. The gowns were sleek and body-conscious, coming in an array of velvet, leather, sequins and lace; there were no girly frills prancing down the runway. His collection began in shades of rich burgundy, then lightened into sparkling and sheer nudes before ending in a parade of black lace.
If the collection was any indication of what the trends will be come this fall, it is safe to say that many of last season’s trends, as well a few of those from spring, will flow into next season. Costello sent various models down the runway with strategically placed cutouts or sheer fabric, two trends that, instead of losing their popularity, have gained even more followers. Velvet, while popular last fall and in the late 1960s and early ’70s, was a material many believed would not last more than one season; Costello however, showed an elegant and modern take on velvet in black and burgundy. Coincidentally, Khloé Kardashian recently wore a floor-length burgundy velvet gown to an Oscar viewing party, reinforcing the popularity of the potential must-have color and fabric for fall 2014.
There are two things one must ask before deciding one’s take on a dress: How does the fit complement the woman’s shape, and how much does it shine? Costello’s gowns practically move with the body and hug every curve (or straight line) to give the woman a dramatic, yet feminine, look. Though many in the industry want to retire the overuse of sequins and glitter, Costello’s inclusion of sequin-covered gowns satiated a thirst within many fashion lovers for all things sparkley. Every season, critics say that black is the new black; Costello’s intuition of mixing fabrics, such as lace and sequins, is the modern way to wear black without looking outdated or, God forbid, boring.
Following Costello’s ready-to-wear line was his much-anticipated couture line. It was clear that Beyoncé’s famed lace dress, which now sits in the GRAMMY Museum along with the dress he designed for singer Tamar Braxton-Herbert, was following the trend of white lace dresses of Costello’s couture line. Usually, long-sleeved lace gowns in white or ivory run the risk of looking too conservative and matronly. Costello, however, kept things interesting and fresh with exaggerated bell sleeves and deep V-necks.
His couture line was an elegant transformation of whites and ivories to silver, and finally to red. Though a ready-to-wear collection is oftentimes much more conservative, a designer’s couture line is where his or her creativity and artistry are truly exposed. The couture dresses were works of art, boasting beautiful ruffles and intricate folding details. Again, there were many recurring trends: sheer fabric, lace, ruffles, high slits and peplum. Peplum has not died yet, nor does it show any indication of going away anytime soon, for better or worse.
Admittedly, the couture dresses are not for the faint of heart, nor for the introvert. They demand attention, but do so in the most elegant way possible. The fabric is unfussy and the shape is still relatively form-fitting, but neither aspect competes with the details on each dress. They allude to Costello’s Southern California background, where women want to look sophisticated and sexy but do not want to give the impression that they tried too hard or spent hours planning an outfit.
The Style Fashion Week audience gave Costello a standing ovation. His collections were not over the top, yet they were still impactful and memorable. Every year, Style Fashion Week continues to grow in notoriety as it competes to reach the level of attention New York and London Fashion Weeks have. If it continues to showcase talent such as Costello’s, the show’s organizers should have no problem reaching their goal.

Dear USC Community, 
You might have heard that the Democratic Republic of Congo is home to the deadliest conflict in the world. The last time anyone counted (2007), an estimated 5.4 million people had died as a result of ongoing violence by rebel groups, invading armies and the Congolese military itself. Millions more have been displaced from their homes. Sexual violence against women and men has become so commonplace that the Congo is frequently referred to as the “rape capital of the world.” The violence is so pervasive that is has all but turned back the tide of development in a country that, resource-wise, is one of the world’s richest.
As a rule, such devastation repulses us. In the words of DRC documentarian Mike Ramsdell, “if you try, empathetically, to connect with those statistics, you will explode on impact.”
These are experiences that most of us have the privilege of not being able to fathom. For this reason, we hear what’s happening in the eastern Congo and our immediate reaction is to turn away.
But increased awareness about the DRC can do much more than horrify. The Congo conflict is a uniquely devastating crisis, but it is also unique in its ties to the international community — even as far away as our own campus in Los Angeles.
This is because the minerals essential for the operation of our cell phones, laptops and other portable electronic devices come almost exclusively from the eastern Congo, the epicenter of the conflict.
These so-called conflict minerals — gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum (more commonly known by its naturally occurring ore, coltan) — are not the sole source of violence in the Congo. But to some, the lucrative profits they offer make the country’s mines an asset worth killing for.
Furthermore, even when these minerals aren’t directly incentivizing violence, they are paying for it.
Fortunately, the electronics sector has made great strides in advancing conflict-free business practices. Governments, non-governmental organizations and private sector actors have partnered in the creation of a mine certification scheme, which allows buyers to accurately identify non-violent suppliers from which to purchase their minerals. Groups such as the Electronic Industry Citizen Coalition and Source Intelligence are offering compliance assistance for Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires businesses to publicly disclose conflict minerals used in their products.
USC can support these and other efforts by condemning the trade of conflict minerals and calling upon its business partners to become conflict-free.
USC is, by all counts, an international university. Not only do we have the largest international student population of any school in the country, but we also boast a diverse international faculty and offer a plethora of opportunities for student engagement abroad. In an increasingly globalized world, the work of leaders educated here will almost certainly transcend international borders.
USC is proud of this international legacy, but if we are going to consider ourselves part of a global community, we must come to its defense when it is threatened. We must stand for human rights and dignity when given the opportunity, because we Trojans can build a world that is better than that.
Yesterday, STAND Against Genocide gathered at Tommy Trojan to rally for a conflict-free future for the Congo. We recognize that this vision starts with a conflict-free future for ourselves. We are asking today that USC takes its own stand against mass violence and embraces the commitment to public leadership and public service highlighted in the university’s mission statement.
By publishing a statement condemning the trade of conflict minerals and calling on our business partners to pursue conflict-free practices, we can help to change history. In doing so, we will join other prestigious and influential institutions, such as Duke University, Pomona College, Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania, as leaders in global citizenship and social responsibility, as well as tech giants Apple and Intel, both of which affirmed their commitment to conflict-free electronics earlier this year.
STAND makes this request with the support of the following USC faculty:

Edward Snowden showed the world what happens when the government spies on its constituents. And Tuesday, California Senator Dianne Feinstein, head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, showed the world what happens when the government spies on those who govern.
Design by Mollie Berg
Feinstein alleged on the Senate floor that during an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee of the CIA’s past use of enhanced interrogation techniques such as waterboarding, CIA agents searched a computer drive used by Senate staffers in preparation for that investigation.
The outcome of the investigation is a more than 6,000-page report that examines the CIA’s controversial use of enhanced interrogation techniques following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. To add fuel to the fire, the CIA has alleged that Senate staffers — who were given clearance to access more than 6.2 million classified records when compiling the report — broke the law by accessing and copying documents they should not have had access to, according to the Washington Post.
The CIA’s counterattack, spearheaded by CIA General Counsel Robert Eatinger, is a blatant attempt to deflect attention from the real story. Feinstein said the documents that are the subject of the uproar were accessed using a search tool that the CIA gave to staffers to help them sift through information. The CIA has since sought to prevent the report from being declassified.
First and foremost, the report should be declassified. If nothing else, both the 300-page condensed version and the CIA’s report submitted in refutation should be released. That action requires leadership and pressure from the Obama administration, which should be a no-brainer given the fact that President Barack Obama already supports declassification of the report. Unless the CIA can prove a national security threat might arise from revelations that they engaged in illegal practices, the American people should have access to them.
Additionally, if allegations that the CIA scoured the server of Congressional researchers are true, such conduct would be a gross breach of governmental boundaries and would add fuel to the already burning fire around the actions of the National Security Agency. Such actions would not only be in violation of the Constitution’s protection from unreasonable search and seizure, but would also violate several computer fraud and abuse laws as well as a direct presidential order.
Most Americans are willing to tolerate the clandestine actions of the CIA, whose past shadiness stretches from a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro in the 1970s to the 1980 Contra wars in Central America. The line should be drawn at domestic surveillance of elected leaders.
In typical CIA fashion, director John Brennan has denied all accusations.
“As far as the allegations of CIA hacking into Senate computers — nothing could be further from the truth. We wouldn’t do that. I mean that’s, that’s, that’s just beyond the scope of reason,” Brennan told the Council on Foreign Relations.
Doing things beyond the scope of reason is well within the CIA’s repertoire — let’s not forget why the report in question was written in the first place. In 2005, when the Intelligence Committee sought information on the CIA’s use of detention and use of enhanced interrogation techniques, the CIA destroyed several key pieces of evidence, including videotapes, that substantiated the claim that enhanced interrogation was being used.
Whatever the outcome, Feinstein’s speech also begs the question of whose answer reflects poorly on all of Congress, including Feinstein herself. Why does it take the CIA spying on the Senate for legislators to actually wake up and call out the government? When the NSA was accused of tapping German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone, no one lifted a finger. When the NSA lifted Verizon phone records for millions of Americans, Feinstein was one of the first to defend the controversial actions. But when it comes to the CIA searching a hard drive, it’s an about face:
“I have asked for an apology and a recognition that this CIA search of computers used by its oversight committee was inappropriate,” Feinstein said. “I have received neither.”
If Feinstein deserves an apology for the actions of the CIA in searching a single hard drive, so should the millions of Americans whose phone calls have been listened to by the NSA. Paradoxically, Feinstein has been one of the NSA’s biggest defenders, most recently at a dinner in Century City, Calif., hosted by the Pacific Council on International Policy.
This borders on hypocrisy; Feinstein’s actions reveal despicable government overreach, but they are also a reminder that we shouldn’t wait until an abuse of power effects us personally before we take action to defend against it. If Congress deserves to be protected from government spying, than so does the rest of the United States.

The USC baseball team dashed Loyola Marymount’s dreams of adding another win to their seven-game winning streak last night in a 6-1 victory at Dedeaux Field. Although the Trojans missed some key opportunities early in the game in terms of advancing runners and making key outs, the team found its stride by the 4th inning in terms of hitting and never looked back.
This big win came at an essential time for the Trojans, who entered the game fresh off of a four-game losing streak. Over the weekend, the Trojans began with a 6-1 loss to Houston on Friday, a 10-4 loss to Pepperdine on Saturday and finally a 6-5 loss to UCLA on Sunday.
Last night, the Trojans corrected many of the mistakes that contributed to this losing streak, including poor showings by the Trojans’ bullpen. In contrast, freshman Jeff Paschke, sophomore Marc Huberman, senior James Ian and senior James Guillen each contributed to the team’s win by keeping the Lions at only one run.
USC head coach, Dan Hubbs, complimented the work of his relieving pitchers in last night’s match.
“I think the bullpen guys did a really good job at controlling the game and keeping LMU to only one run,” Hubbs said. “They showed that they’re more than capable of making the big pitches and outs even though they struggled over the weekend. They seemed to bounce back today.”
The starting pitcher, sophomore Brent Wheatley, also pitched well during his five innings of work which included three strikeouts, six this and no earned runs. During the first two innings, Wheatley struggled to get the ball over the plate, often creating a 2-0 count for the batter, though he eventually found composure and took command of the mound. He found his curveball later in the game and managed to limit hits while increasing the number of strikes.
The match started out shaky for the Trojans as sloppy fielding mistakes continuously allowed for the Lions to advance the bases when easy outs could have been made. The Trojans had two errors from the infield, eventually resulting in one earned run, the only run the Lion’s scored all game.
Both defense and offense came together for the Trojans by the 4th inning as Wheatley quickly obtained three outs through two strikeouts and forcing an easy grounder towards first base.
The Trojan offense then came alive by taking advantage of the Lions’ pitcher, Brenton Arriaga, who failed to consistently throw the ball in the strike zone. Sophomore infielder A.J. Ramirez started out the sequence by ripping the ball out to centerfield. The Trojans soon had two men on second and third with only one out.
Tim Peabody then came in as reliever for the Lions and managed another out before walking sophomore outfielder Vahn Bozoian, loading the bases with two outs. Junior catcher Garrett Stubbs then came up big at the plate on the 2-2 pitch by hitting a deep ball to centerfield, bringing home two runners for a 2-1 lead.
Further batting action occurred during the bottom of the seventh inning against the Lion’s new reliever, Carlos Fuentes. After a walk and two singles, the bases were loaded as Flores approached the plate before slicing a double down the third base line into left field, scoring three runs and putting the Trojans in a 5-1 lead. Bozoian then sailed a double out to deep right field bringing Flores home and the score to 6-1.
Flores attributes his big hit to his teammate’s ability to get on base.
“Throughout the entire game, my team did a great job on getting in scoring position,” Flores said. “When I came up to bat, I just wanted to deliver for my team. Coach Hubbs had stressed to us that the LMU pitchers would throw the ball down and away from me, so I knew what to do when the big pitch came.”
The 8th and 9th innings wrapped up fairly quickly thanks to a one, two three inning by USC reliever in the 8th and a double play to end the game during the top of the 9th.
Hubbs believes that last night’s win can be attributed to many factors, but primarily hitting.
“I thought we did a really good job at bat,” Hubbs said. “We had a very specific plan against each pitcher and I think we executed those plans well. I think we had a really great day at the plate for the most part.”
Despite this success, Flores admits that the Trojans still need to make improvements in terms of hitting to continue winning in the future.
“Last night we had a long stretch in the game where we only had two runs, mainly because we did a poor job at sacrificing ourselves to advance runners already in scoring position,” Flores said. “I think we can definitely improve in that aspect.”
This weekend, USC will hit the road to face the 12-4 Oregon Ducks in a Pac-12 conference series. Despite Oregon’s successes early in the season, Hubbs feels confident that the Trojans can come through with wins against the Ducks after making minor alterations in preparation for the series.
“I think for this weekend we just need to clean some stuff up and sharpen out game in terms of advancing runners and coming up with big hits,” Hubbs said. “We’re just trying to play our best baseball possible. If we play the way we’re capable of playing, we will beat anyone in the country.”
