Dr. Anthony Fauci attended a virtual conversation hosted by the USC Center for Health Journalism Tuesday, discussing with Dan Diamond, the national health reporter from The Washington Post, to talk about the emerging threat posed by monkeypox, the status quo of the coronavirus  pandemic, and the lessons that both the government and public learned on how to respond to infectious diseases.
The event is part of the Health Matters webinar series organized by the Center for Health Journalism. According to Michelle Levander, the center’s founding director, her team had been preparing for the event with Fauci as the monkeypox virus started to spread, and Fauci decided to step back from his position as President Joe Biden’s top medical adviser and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
“He’s retiring right now,” Levander said. “That’s when [Fauci] might be more philosophical and reflect on what [he has] accomplished.”
At the top of the event, Fauci first discussed the current status of the coronavirus pandemic, a “relative” matter that he thinks is too soon to proclaim over. 
“I don’t think we can say [it’s] the end — being no more COVID is in sight,” Fauci said, echoing Biden’s recent declaration that the pandemic is over. “Now we are at much, much lower [number of cases and deaths]. Relatively speaking, it is less,s…Bbut it is still at a level that I have been very public about saying that I am not comfortable with having more than three to four hundred deaths per day.”
Fauci also stressed that the upcoming winter season and potential new variants of the virus might exacerbate the situation in the future. The most recent emerging subvariant of Omicron — BA.2.75.2, reported in 47 countries and 39 states — has been alarming to many scientists as it can elude the immunity provided by current vaccines and cannot be neutralized by many current antiviral drug treatments.
“Even though BA.5 is still the dominant variant, you have the creeping up of sublineages like BA.4.6; we don’t have much of BA.2.75.2 yet, but there are other countries that do have that,” Fauci said. “So, although we can feel good that we are going in the right direction, we can’t let our guard down.”
After stressing that people should be inoculated with the recently updated bivalent booster shots to better prevent the spread of the predominant BA.5 variant, Fauci then reflected on the lessons that the public should learn from the coronavirus  pandemic — including highlighting the difficulty of making public health decisions and disease prevention recommendations within the evolving conditions of a pandemic.
Specifically, Fauci claimed that in the context of the pandemic, where additional information, data and evidence came to experts’ attention every day, different — or even contradictory — decisions may be made.
“At one point in time, you don’t have the information that is really necessary to make the ultimate, correct recommendation that may have been correct at the time. But as it evolved, it turns out, [the decision] wasn’t correct,” Fauci said.
Fauci also underscored how social media platforms and the divisiveness of the current political society make it particularly difficult to deliver the hard truth about the pandemic to the public.
“One of the problems is that when you talk about the hard truth and say it in a sentence, given social media and how things [are turned into] misinformation and disinformation, a lot of times there’s a lot of misrepresentation of what a message is,” Fauci said. “If we had true honesty, true transparency, [and did] not [let] things get entangled with social media, it would be much easier [for the public] to get a coherent message of what risks are.”
Fauci also believed that the lessons we have learned in the past could be useful in containing the spread of the monkeypox virus.
“If lessons learned are really learned, we would do better,” Fauci said.
As the event closed with a Q&A section, Fauci urged public health workers and officials to “stick with the science and the data” while reflecting on how he was mired in political discussions and conflicts.
“When I say we should get vaccinated because it saves lives, and someone says no, am I the polarizing figure?” Fauci said. “What I’ve tried to do is to just stay out of the politics.”
Fauci officially announced his decision to leave government service by the end of the year in August. Nevertheless, retirement from the public service seems unable to rescue him from political reprisal as top Republicans in Congress vowed to investigate him about the National Institute of Health’s financial support to a lab in Wuhan, China.

The week of Sept. 25 saw 91 reported coronavirus cases among USC students, faculty and staff — marking the first time this semester that the weekly positive cases dropped below 100. The number is a 19.4% decrease from the 113 cases reported the previous week.
“We were over 500 at the start of the year, so that’s good news,” said Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman in a briefing Tuesday with the Daily Trojan. “While the case numbers are dropping, we want to make sure that that’s not actually related to people not testing and rather just accepting their symptoms.”
Trends at the University continue to follow those in Los Angeles County, where the weekly Monday peak fell 9.6% to 1363 cases Sept. 26, from 1508 a week prior.
“While cases are dropping, they’re not actually as low as they were at previous low periods,” Van Orman said. “We’re continuing with this baseline level of transmission. That’s just something we need to watch.”
The University continues to test wastewater from residential facilities for coronavirus and notifies students of any detections. On Tuesday, students living in Parkside Arts and Humanities Residential College received an email alerting them of coronavirus detected in wastewater, and were advised to get tested within 24 hours.
“While testing provides information about the presence of viral particles, this only indicates further testing, screening and diagnosis may be recommended,” read the email, which was obtained and confirmed by the Daily Trojan. “Positive results may be due to individuals who have recovered from COVID-19, are still shedding virus particles, but are no longer infectious.”
In the meantime, Van Orman encouraged students to get tested and submit a contact tracing form via MySHR if they develop any cold or respiratory symptoms.
Van Orman also addressed the several new omicron-derived subvariants, namely BA.2.75.2 and BQ.1, which, according to headlines printed over the weekend, could contribute to a winter coronavirus wave.
“Emergence of new variants remain[s] a cause for concern,” Van Orman said. “We don’t know yet if any of these new variants that are emerging are going to cause the situation to change. But … after two and a half years, [we] have consistently seen that new variants have emerged and have caused significant increases in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.”
She noted that as of yet, there are no cases of these new variants in the United States. BQ.1 is growing prevalent in the United Kingdom and some European countries, while BA.2.75 variants are appearing in India.
“It is still a very active concern,” Van Orman said of new variants emerging, “Particularly as we move into the winter, where we have an increase in indoor activities and people just being indoors that increase[s] transmission.”
Student Health is reporting two or three influenza cases a week, but Van Orman raised concern that cases are appearing much earlier than expected, and people “have probably not had influenza for a few years.”
“Influenza, even in someone who’s relatively young and healthy, is a very serious illness associated with … many symptoms,” Van Orman said. “Many people with influenza are out of class for almost a week. They don’t feel well for two to three weeks. So getting your flu shot, for students, is really critical in terms of not interrupting your academic progress with an influenza illness.”
Updated immunizations against the coronavirus and influenza have both been available through Student Health as of September, but are not required by the University. In a Universitywide email sent Sept. 29, Student Health encouraged students to get vaccinated by Nov. 1, “especially if you are at higher risk for severe disease because of age or underlying health conditions.” The announcement was in contrast to last fall, when Student Health announced that all students living and attending classes on campus must complete influenza vaccination by Nov. 1, 2021. 
Van Orman said the requirement was part of an “exceptional year,” wherein twin outbreaks of coronavirus and influenza left communities at risk. The removal of the requirement for this year was motivated primarily by high vaccination rates, logistical difficulties in tracking additional immunizations and aligning policy with other higher education institutions across the country.
“Many [students and employees] would now have had to have five vaccines. It becomes increasingly challenging to track that as an employer and as a university,” Van Orman said. “Because so much of our community now has that primary series and has their booster, we know that the protection we’re getting from community transmission is probably pretty significant, and that we really now are looking at individuals’ protection.”
Van Orman said Student Health is now focusing on educating individuals who otherwise “are not interested in getting a booster” and encouraging them to get vaccinated through events such as a Fall Vax Event prevention clinic offering both bivalent boosters and influenza vaccines.

Entering the novice championship motion of the Cornell British Parliamentary Debate tournament, tensions were high. With shifty eyes and quickened heartbeats, two USC partner pairs anxiously waited to hear the subject. The judge announced the topic: Is epicurean philosophy the best way to attain happiness? With only 15 minutes to research and prepare their argument, USC British Parliamentary Debate partners Ashley Ka and Harshitha Dasari came out on top, placing seventh and 11th, respectively.
The USC BPD traveled to Cornell University this past weekend to debate against top schools from across the country, including Cornell, Princeton, Duke and Stanford University. Thirty-eight novice teams and 80 novice speakers debated at the competition. BPD members Veer Juneja and Anna Liu advanced to open category out rounds, placing third and fifth, respectively.
During the friendly competition, debate teams discussed impromptu topics of electoral activism, the mandation of vaccines and biblical scripture, among others.  The event was the team’s first in-person debate competition since the pandemic began. 
The first four rounds of the tournament started on Saturday and the fifth round followed on Sunday. Based on the results of those rounds, competitors could qualify to participate in the out rounds — the final round for those that gained the most points. The two-person teams are split between four positions: opening government, opening opposition, closing government and closing opposition. 
The nature of opening government and opening opposition statements are narrative and world-building-based, which help establish a winning mechanism for how the debate should be judged. The closing government and closing opposition offer whip speeches — overviews of all the arguments in the debate; they are the deciding factor in who wins and why. 
“[The trip] was very exciting. I think it was great to get closer as a group – to travel together is always fun,” said BPD Director of Membership Ka, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and economics. “We also had a lot of success competition wise, which was really exciting.”
The team looked forward to meeting other schools and learning different debating techniques, Ka said. In preparation for its trip to Cornell, USC BPD held a practice debate weekly and practiced various drills, such as weighing mechanisms and refutation to hone their debating skills.
“We’ve been working really hard on making sure we’re communicating well; we pass notes during rounds and that building that partnership in practice has been really great, and it showed at the tournament,” Ka said.
The team members looked forward to talking to new people and experiencing new styles of debate. The days leading up to the tournament were “both exciting and scary,” Ka said, as the event was the team’s first tournament of the season.
“[The tournament is] not just about the debate,” said USC BPD president Aastha Jani, a senior majoring in communication and gender and sexuality studies. “It’s also about the larger circuit, and a lot of us have made really strong connections with debaters and other schools over the years.”
Arriving at Cornell for the BPD debate tournament this past weekend was both “exhilarating and exciting” for first-time competitor Derek Lehman, a junior majoring in non-governmental organizations and social change and communication. Lehman said he entered the tournament as a “wide-eyed ambitious Trojan.” Though he didn’t place, Lehman felt that the disposition he gained was valuable.
“Being a part of the [BPD team] has been my dream for as long as I can remember,” Lehman said. “I worked across years of community college to get to this point, and I want to be a part of this team to be the best litigator and individual I can be.”
USC BPD welcomes people of all backgrounds to participate and does not require past experience in debate — a key reason why the team has gained so many members over the years. 
Jani said they strive to form an environment around BPD that is as equitable, inclusive and holistic as possible because they feel that debate should be an opportunity to learn, and students should not be in an environment that would prompt them to be turned away from BPD for fear or intimidation.
“[BPD] is such a uniquely tight-knit community, while also being super welcoming,” Ka said. “That’s really hard to find and something that I value. We don’t have tryouts. We don’t make cuts, it’s open to everyone who wants to come. It feels like a safe space to try something new and to get up and give a speech.”

The Undergraduate Student Government discussed new student outreach programs, campus medical vending machines and the launch of the USC-LAX shuttle program at Tuesday’s Senate meeting. 
The Senate also swore in senator Sam Nadol, who replaced former senator Victor Ye. Nadol received the 13th most votes during the Spring 2022 election, making him the first eligible candidate to fill the position. 
Nadol campaigned alongside Divya Jakatdar on the values of affordability, accessibility, community and accountability in Spring 2022. As reported by the Daily Trojan, Nadol hoped to boost transportation accessibility by broadening the Fryft time window and geographic radius and to improve coronavirus safety protocols.
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Ye, who resigned effective Sept. 27, said his resignation was for “personal reasons related to career advancement.” Ye also cited “institutional pushback” within USG as a reason for leaving, and said working with the administration was harder than he expected. Ye did not, however, rule out joining USG again in the future. Ye’s resignation was not discussed at the meeting. 
Project managers Carlo DiBernardo and Sara Stienecker announced the launch of “SCÜP” pilot program, a new free shuttle service open to students from USC to the Los Angeles International Airport. Aiming to increase sustainability, safety and savings, the program will operate for 17 days for the rest of the semester, beginning with the upcoming Fall Recess between Oct. 13 to Oct. 14. Buses in operation will be leased through Gold Coast transit. 
“I’m sure many people would have paid $50 for a Lyft to the airport, that’s actually more expensive than my plane ticket,” Steinecker said. 
SCÜP will lease 18 bus rides on Wednesday from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m., and nine rides on Thursday from 7 a.m. till 5 p.m. Each bus can accommodate up to 55 students and will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis through the online signup forum. All buses are fully accessible by those with mobility devices and will accommodate wheelchairs, scooters and other devices up to 30 inches wide, 48 inches long and up to 600 pounds. 
Buses will pick up students on McClintock Avenue between the football practice field and the track; however, DiBernardo and Stienecker are planning up to four more stops both on and off campus. A service from LAX back to USC is still being developed. 
Funded by USG, the program is expected to accommodate 9,408 riders over the year and incur a total cost of $62,891.84 while removing 17,380 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions. 
Similar to the Lyft rideshare program, DiBernardo is working with University to implement the program as an official University service. 
“We’re looking to reassess certain metrics that USC Transportation can sign off and say this is a service that is economically sustainable or something that we can actually do,” DiBernardo said. 
Steinecker said that with the high-level administrative support and technical paper showing the demonstrated impact of the program in the works, “it’s pretty likely the University would definitely be open to it.”
Senator Michelle Lu discussed her yearly goals, including the widespread adoption of medical vending machines around campus.
By working with USC Pharmacy and USC Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman, Lu hopes to make medical supplies accessible to students around the clock. Vending machines would feature first aid, contraception, menstrual products and over-the-counter medication. 
“Injuries happen on campus every day. You’re skateboarding, people fall and sometimes you will have to wait 40 minutes at the [USC] Bookstore or even go to Engemann [Student Health Center] and wait 40 minutes in order to get medical supplies,” Lu said. “This would just be accessible and something that students can quickly access throughout the day.”
Working alongside Van Orman, Lu is looking for places to put the vending machines that ensure both accessibility and privacy. 
Lu is also spearheading the charge to integrate the USCard into Apple Wwallet. She’s still researching the logistics of the integration and alternatives in the case that Apple is unable to accommodate the service.
Lu said she also hopes to renovate the “LiveSafe” app to provide students with all points of contact and resources during times of crisis. Developed alongside the USC Department of Public Safety, the app offers push-button calls to DPS, messaging for reporting suspicious activity, crimes in progress, or general safety concerns, and SafeWalk to have friends and family virtually escort students around the area. 
While all students are directed to download the app during freshman orientation, Lu wants to promote the usability and services it provides. 
“We had a meeting with Dr. Van Orman last Friday, and we are scheduling to meet with the Senior Vice President for Safety in regard to future promotions and improvements of the app,” Lu said.

It’s October! And along with it comes a duality of feelings. It’s midterm season, but it’s also spooky season. What better way to heal from the test you’re sure you bombed than to unwind and watch some of October’s best additions to the streaming world? With plenty of new shows and scary films coming out this month, you’ll have a plethora of content to keep you entertained all the way through Oct. 31.
Netflix
“The Midnight Club” — Oct. 7
For fans of “The Haunting of Bly Manor” and “The Haunting of Hill House” comes “The Midnight Club” by shared showrunner Mike Flanagan. Based on Christopher Pike’s book of the same name, the series centers around a group of teenagers admitted to the Brightcliffe Hospice who meet every night to tell each other scary stories. One night they make a pact that the first one of them to die has to contact the others from beyond the grave, which sets off a slew of strange occurrences. This show is sure to provide a few thrills for those who are not faint of heart.
“Wendell & Wild” — Oct. 28
“Wendell & Wild” is a stop-motion animation with horror-directing icon Jordan Peele as one of its producers and writers. This film marks Henry Selick’s return to directing after the creation of Halloween cult classic film “Coraline” (2009). The story is reminiscent of Selick’s films, such as “The Nightmare Before Christmas” (1993), as he once again strives to give the world a creepy classic animation. 
“Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities” — Oct. 25
Guillermo Del Toro has slated multiple projects with Netflix, with “Cabinet of Curiosities” definitely being one to pique interest. It’s a horror anthology series with eight episodes, each with its own director and dedicated cast. Two of these stories are by Del Toro himself, with one written by David S. Goyer. The show will present horror in a new way, with Netflix saying, “Guillermo Del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities promises a macabre mashup of genre-defining horror.”
Hulu
“Hellraiser” — Oct. 7 
If you are a horror film fanatic, check out this reboot of the original 1987 “Hellraiser” franchise, written by David S. Goyer, who also wrote the Dark Knight Trilogy. As of now, the movie is being praised, with movie critic Cody Leach writing, “the new reboot on Hulu brings the carnage back to its roots and delivers the best installment since the original.” Maybe don’t watch this film in the dark unless, of course, you’re ready for a nightmare-filled night.
Disney+
“Werewolf By Night” — Oct. 7
This is the perfect companion for a Halloween movie night. The story follows a group of monster hunters who believe that there may be a monster among them. “Werewolf By Night” is Marvel Studios’ first TV special and from the trailer alone seems to be very tonally different from their other projects. Michael Giacchino directs and even composed the music for the special, following his work composing “Up,” “Ratatouille,” “Jojo Rabbit” and “The Incredibles.” A little sneak peek of the score can be heard in the “Werewolf by Night” trailer. 
AppleTV
“Shantaram” — Oct. 14
Since their successful soiree this past awards season, AppleTV has been putting out a lot of high-quality content recently which makes “Shantaram” one to watch out for. Set in Bombay, India, the series is based on a book, which, according to its author, is based on partially true events. 
“Some experiences from my life are described pretty much as they happened, and others are created narratives, informed by my experience,” author Gregory Roberts said. 
The series centers around an Australian bank robber who escapes prison and runs to Bombay, meeting interesting individuals while he’s there.

“The White Lotus” — Oct. 30
When “The White Lotus” premiered last year, it was a massive success, so much so that HBO decided to turn it from a limited series into a full-fledged television show. 
After its big Emmy wins, the second season is awaited with much anticipation. It’s an anthology series, so while we can’t expect to see many of our favorite characters return, Jennifer Coolidge will return to her role as Tanya for this season. Apart from Coolidge, there are many new characters being played by the likes of Aubrey Plaza and Theo James. It is coming out on the eve of Halloween, so you have plenty of time to catch up on season 1 before then!

A proposed surf park, dubbed “Coral Mountain,” in the city of La Quinta in Coachella Valley was rejected unanimously by the City Council mid-September. 
Thank god. The last thing Californians need is a gigantic water-wasting project like this. 
The project, proposed by luxury real estate company Meriwether Co., would consist of a hotel, several hundred homes and a gigantic water basin with technology to bring the ocean a hundred miles or so inland. 
Pro surfer Kelly Slater’s company developed the hydrofoil generator that creates the waves, which can reach up to 8 feet high. According to the Kelly Slater Wave Co. website, “The wave form is inspired and designed by world class ocean waves.”
I don’t know if this means the ocean waves themselves got involved in this, admittedly cool, concept but if so, they didn’t consider the problems with building such a pool in one of the driest areas of the country. 
California is in the middle of a megadrought that has seen three consecutive dry years with another projected to be on the way. As the water year comes to a close, experts predict that this fall will see above average temperatures and a warm and dry winter. 
In Coachella Valley, residents actually use about three times more water than the state average per person. There are 124 irrigated golf courses in Palm Springs and Coachella Valley, which as a whole makes up less than one percent of Southern California’s population yet contains 28 percent of the region’s golf courses. Those golf courses use between 750,000 and 1 million gallons of water a day. While the golf industry employs over 8,000 workers and generates almost $750 million in golf-related spending per year, it is clear that its pristine courses are major water wasters in the region. 
So, to add a luxury surf park that would waste even more water would be a slap in the face to residents who aren’t involved in the tourism industry. 
Residents of Riverside County already face fines for going over their allotted outside water budget. It seems wrong for a company made up of just 10 employees, including its owners, to benefit from such a large increase in water usage for the enjoyment of wealthy snowbirds and visitors. 
Because while everyone loses in a drought, it’s the poorest communities that are hit the hardest, according to a report from the Legislative Analyst’s Office, California’s nonpartisan policy advisor. 
“The communities most impacted by drinking water challenges during the last drought were small and rural,” the report says. “Many of the communities that lost, or remain vulnerable to losing, access to safe drinking water contain high proportions of both lower-income and Latino residents.” 
Blaine Carian of the Coachella Valley Resource Conservation District claims that Coachella Valley’s water supply is better off than most regions in California, stored in the underground water aquifer. 
“We have a lot of years of water in our storage basin,” Carian said in an interview with KESQ News.
According to the Desert Water Agency, if no water conservation efforts were made, there would still be around 100 years’ worth of water stored up in the underground basins. As beneficiaries of the Colorado River, La Quinta and surrounding towns are well-equipped to handle drought. 
But perhaps the Desert Water Agency should talk to those living in mobile home parks near the Coral Mountain site, whose water is contaminated with toxic arsenic and unsafe to drink.
So perhaps Coachella Valley will survive the drought, new golf courses and surf parks or not. However, the drought transcends just one area  — it’s a multi-state issue that will continue to grow more dire as the climate continues to dry up. 
There are plenty of places for people to surf — we don’t need to make the desert one of them. Wealthy people already account for disproportionate water usage, adding a surf resort would only add to that problem. Go to Venice Beach, I hear there are some pretty good waves there.

Mushrooms and Björk’s music have a lot in common. Both are wild, but grounded. Their roots both run deep. Either one could be a stubborn relic from some fantastical ancient world, yet they are both very much alive. And when consumed, both can induce psychedelic effects. This is your brain on Björk.
Now spanning four decades, the 56-year-old Icelandic oddball’s career has been marked by reinvention. From the delicate twinkles of 2001’s “Vespertine” to the devastating black hole of 2015’s breakup epic “Vulnicura,” Björk has never made the same album twice. Her singular voice and artistic vision have kept both fans and critics eager to see the world she’ll dream up next.
Her most recent world, as it turns out, was right under our feet.
“Fossora,” Björk’s 10th studio album, is themed around fungus. Exploring themes of motherhood, death, growth and — most prominently — hope, “Fossora” presents an enthralling display of what happens when a seasoned artist ventures back down to earth — literally.
Similar to 2017’s “Utopia,” “Fossora” is an outdoor album, weaving Björk’s equal-parts delicate and harsh vocals into a sprawling quilt of woodwind instruments and elegant production.
But the bird chirps and excess of love songs of “Utopia” are nowhere to be found: if “Utopia” was a bright open field, “Fossora” is a damp forest floor. The sun doesn’t shine here, but something is still growing.
The video for lead single and album opener, “Atopos,” begins with close-up shots of crystalline mushrooms, turquoise and dewy in beds of deep brown soil. The camera then cuts to a silhouetted Björk standing atop a mound of earth and fungus before it ventures in, burrowing beneath her feet. Björk is the master of this twisted biome, and she invites us in. Despite the video’s murky aesthetic, the song’s message is optimistic, if cautionary. “If we don’t grow outwards towards love / we’ll implode inwards towards destruction,” she sings over blaring clarinets. Björk has always written about connection, but it’s never felt quite this dire.
“Atopos” ends with a minute-long hardcore electronic outro that wouldn’t sound out-of-place on a 100 gecs song. Grating, erratic and at first tough-to-swallow, “Atopos” is a fearless reassertion of Björk’s presence on the cutting edge, and a reminder that she has nothing left to prove.
While most of the record is less sonically intense than its opener — although the whimsical “Fungal City” and title track “Fossora” venture into similarly headbanging territory — it is no less emotionally potent.
During the making of “Atopos,” Björk experienced the loss of her mother. While themes of matriarchy run through the entire album, Björk addresses her mother directly on two songs.
The first, “Sorrowful Soil,” as its title suggests, is a melancholy reflection on the struggles of motherhood and her own mother’s resulting nihilism. She ultimately consoles her mother: “You did well / you, you did your best,” she sings.
The other, “Ancestress,” comes directly after “Sorrowful Soil” in the tracklist, and chronologically traces her mother’s presence in her life from childhood lullabies to hospital beds. “My ancestress’ clock is ticking / Her once vibrant rebellion is fading / I am her hope-keeper,” she sings. At over seven minutes, “Ancestress” is the longest song on “Fossora.” It’s a glowing centerpiece for an album centered around personal growth and holding onto hope.
Curiously, the explicit fungal metaphors that spring up frequently across the tracklist are absent in the lyrics of “Ancestress.” The song needs no high concept or artifice — it’s honest, sincere and brimming with wisdom.
Björk employs a handful of collaborators across “Fossora,” but she wrote herself. While Björk’s close friend and frequent collaborator Arca, an experimental visionary herself, is notably absent (she co-produced nearly all of the tracks on “Vulnicura” and “Utopia”), it’s refreshing to see Björk take the helm with force and finesse.
“Fossora” could have easily been a victory lap. Björk certainly understands the breadth and impact of her career: along with “Fossora,” she debuted her “Sonic Symbolism” podcast, in which she goes back and examines each of her past albums in depth. But Björk has never been one to rest on her laurels, and “Fossora” opts to plant something wholly new in her discography.
On mid-album highlight “Allow,” Björk personifies herself as a growing plant, cooing over a bed of flutes. “Allow, allow, allow me to grow,” she sings on the chorus.
Coming from an artist of Björk’s stature, it’s a remarkable statement of humility and a testament to her ever-evolving spirit. Even with her roots digging down through 56 years of life and nearly 30 years of musical releases, Björk still doesn’t have all the answers to life’s mysteries — but she’s still looking for them, and she’s not afraid to get her hands dirty in the process.

Whether you grew up on the hallmark sketch comedy television show or gripe about how it hasn’t been the same since the ‘70s, “Saturday Night Live” premiered its 48th season Saturday featuring host Miles Teller and musical guest Kendrick Lamar. The premiere follows a profound upheaval in the show’s cast following the last season. Although it is natural for the show to flush cast members out, the newest departures occurred at an unusually high volume. 
Preceding the 48th season, SNL ushered out repertory players Aidy Bryant, Pete Davidson, Kate McKinnon, Alex Moffat, Kyle Mooney, Chris Redd and Melissa Villseñor, along with featured performer Aristotle Athari. The show welcomed two stand up comedians in Marcello Hernandez and Michael Longfellow and two actors and stand-up comedians in Molly Kearney and Devon Walker. 
The net loss of four actors is notable as it is the largest cast switch-up SNL has experienced in almost a decade. Executive producer Lorne Michaels even called this season “a transition year,” noting that actors stayed at the show longer due to the Coronavirus and a lack of other acting opportunities for existing cast members.
Nonetheless, SNL seems to be leaning into this theme of change in the season opener. Aside from the logo change, switching from modern to a more chic ‘80s style, there is a devastating level of self-awareness demonstrated in the show’s writing. 
The cold open followed a parody of “ManningCast,” Peyton and Eli Manning’s new sports analysis show, but instead of sports, the two hosts broke down and analyzed the sketch being performed in front of them. Right off the bat, there were biting jokes about player archetypes in the cast (e.g. Bowen Yang and his attempt to create a new catchphrase). 
It also encapsulates some of the anxiety the actors, writers and crew are likely experiencing with this new season: is this funny? The answer: yes. The introspective take and review on the show’s own humor provided for unique comedy, an aspect the show has struggled with during  the post-Trump era, and it was a great kick-off to the episode. 
Teller, fresh off of his summer blockbuster “Top Gun: Maverick” (2022), quipped some adorable anecdotes about how integral SNL was to his childhood, even playing a home video of him and his siblings recreating the Spartan Cheerleaders characters. Of course, he made references to his other career endeavors, like during a quick jab to “Whiplash”(2014) and J.K. Simmons: “I even took piano lessons. My instructor was J.K. Simmons, who was surprisingly nice.”  
Overall, Teller, especially given the fact that this was his first time hosting, brought fantastic charm to sketches and complemented other cast members well. Despite being Kendrick Lamar’s third appearance on SNL, he delivered phenomenal yet subtle performances with “N95” and “Father Time,” both tracks from his album “Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers.”  
SNL is notable for timely and irreverent sketches, which the show delivered. One of the strongest from the night was “Send Something Normal,” a game-show-style sketch about having male celebrities, such as Armie Hammer and Adam Levine, responding to direct messages on social media platforms in an average manner. It was a simple yet hilarious commentary on trending recent celebrity scandals. 
A similar sentiment is seen within the “BeReal” sketch, another great execution of approaching a trend in a thought-provokingly funny way. SNL’s shake-up has scored initial success in catering towards the younger generation in a way that has avoided (thus far) cringe comedy. 
For example, the “Nicole Kidman AMC Ad” is catered directly towards Gen-Z Twitter users. SNL is definitely not how it was in the ‘70s, but is there a greater pleasure than seeing Kenan Thompson salute a faux Nicole Kidman? 
The show’s youthful energy was even prevalent in “Weekend Update.” Continuing their tenure behind the desk, Michael Che and Colin Jost delivered quick and constant punchlines, an action they have been able to complete for their many seasons behind the desk. One of the strongest moments was new featured player Michael Longfellow’s brief appearance. 
Longfellow’s performance was reminiscent of Pete Davidson’s appearances on “Weekend Update” as he leaned more into a stand up than character based comedy. Longfellow performed a great, tight set and was a natural performer — his presence behind the desk made it appear as though he was a veteran cast member. 
SNL’s premiere promised a vigorous start to the season that demonstrates the show distancing itself from “easy comedy,” bits about absurd and wacky current events that leave little wiggle room for creativity to shine. Given the upheaval within the cast, it’s fun to see the new sketches and styles being brought to the table this season. SNL is definitely not how it was in the ‘70s, with cast members being scouted off of TikTok followings (a vital aspect of Longfellow’s stand up career), but it is indicative of perhaps a greater trend being seen in comedy: The kids are taking a seat at the “grown-ups’ table” and they’re taking it with spunk, a whole lot of silliness and a new font for the logo in tow.

USC has started the season 5-0 for the first time since 2006.
The Trojans’ record is a testament to the rebuild Head Coach Lincoln Riley and company have done. Much of it was on display against Arizona State University last Saturday — a consistent offense with a balance of running and passing plays plus a tough defense.
Here are the biggest takeaways from USC’s victory last Saturday.
Williams returns to form 
After his worst statistical game this season against Oregon State, the media didn’t hear from sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams the entire week. He wasn’t made available to answer questions about his 16-for-36 performance, but Riley had a clear outlook on Williams’ performance.
“It was just one of those nights… it’s like a pitcher in baseball. Sometimes you don’t have your best stuff,” said Riley early last week.
Well, he was right. Williams returned with a game that’s becoming almost routine for him. He threw for 348 yards and 3 touchdowns on 27-for-37 passing. He was also second in rushing for the Trojans with 44 yards and one rushing touchdown. 
However, he did have his first turnover of the season, an interception near the goal line in the second half. But on the bright side, the turnover seemed like more of a miscommunication than a bad throw. 
The quarterback is also becoming known for turning near sacks into positive plays. Williams was almost brought down for a safety in the first half, but a jump pass turned the play into a first down. 
Williams is still a favorite for the Heisman Trophy  after this week and his importance to the Trojans cannot be understated. 
Penalties pile up for Trojans 
Excessive penalties became a staple of USC during the Clay Helton era. For the most part, the Trojans have cleaned that up this season, but it came back around against Arizona State.
In the four games before this past Saturday, USC’s penalty totals never exceeded 9 — it had 4 against Fresno State, 6 against Rice and Oregon State and 9 against Stanford. 
The Trojans went back to their old ways with 6 in the first half against the Sun Devils and 8  for the game. Penalties fell into a drought most of the second half, but came back to bite USC with 2 pass interference calls on Arizona State’s touchdown drive in the fourth. 
The most costly of them came late in the first half. A long touchdown reception by sophomore wide receiver Mario Williams was negated by a holding penalty by USC. The Trojans punted on that drive and with Arizona State getting the ball after halftime, it put USC’s defense on its heels, which leads me to my next takeaway… 
The defense has an up and down game 
In many ways, the Trojans’ defense was the star of their win against the Beavers. Where the offense struggled to gain steam throughout the night, it was the defense that kept USC alive in the game. The Trojans allowed just 320 yards and forced 4 turnovers, making timely stops to bail out the offense. 
But, it was a different story against the Sun Devils early on. Arizona State scored 17 points in the first half, more than Oregon State did in the entire game the week before. It was a slightly different story in the second half. 
USC forced 3 Sun Devil punts in a row to start the half. The Trojans’ pass rush bothered Arizona State too, with 5 sacks in the second half alone. They didn’t close the game out well though, giving up a touchdown on a bizarre drive to cut the USC lead down to 10 with six minutes left.
The Trojans also forced yet another turnover, their 15th of the season. That side of the ball continues to be a pleasant surprise. 
Offensive line changes 
There was concern surrounding the Trojans’ offensive line coming into the season. 
USC was set on the interior with returning players and redshirt seniors Brett Neilon, Justin Dedich and Andrew Vorhees. But, it was the left tackle position that needed some figuring out and Riley decided to split reps between redshirt senior and Virginia transfer Bobby Haskins and redshirt sophomore Courtland Ford. Haskins got most of the snaps Saturday after Ford was called for a key penalty.
It was more of the same against the Sun Devils, however, a new problem arose — a banged-up Dedich was replaced by redshirt sophomore Gino Quinones as a starter. Quinones did a solid job holding his own, but losing the experienced Dedich for an extended period of time would be a problem. 
After the game, Riley indicated they’d continue to evaluate Dedich, who has been “a little banged up.” Keeping that offensive line healthy is key for the rest of the season.

Lucy Westlake is more than just a stud runner: She’s also the youngest American woman to climb Mount Everest, a clean water advocate and a recipient of a Billie Jean King Youth Leadership Award. (That’s all in addition to being a bona fide star of the cross country team.)
Now, you can add another accolade to that list — the Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes, an award that recognizes young people who make a significant impact on people, their communities and the environment. The freshman received her award for raising more than $30,000 to bring safe water technology to the developing world. 
“It was amazing just to have your work recognized,” Westlake said. “I love what I do, and I have had this passion since I was 13 years old, so it’s been a long time just kind of building.”
Westlake began her water advocacy after her Ugandan penpal, Faith — who she’s corresponded with since age two — told Westlake of her daily two-mile walk to fetch contaminated water. The two originally met through Samaritan’s Purse, and have remained friends ever since.
Nearly a decade after their first correspondence, Westlake discovered WaterStep, a nonprofit that installs sustainable chlorinators around the world. Soon after, Westlake and her family went to Uganda to meet Faith and install a chlorinator in her village.
That certainly wasn’t the end of it. Westlake went on to organize a shoe drive at her school to provide affordable footwear for people in developing countries and funds for WaterStep, which she later expanded to ten high schools that organize shoe drives every March on World Water Day. The group has raised $25,000 so far. 
Earlier this year, Westlake graduated high school a semester early and met up with Faith again, installing more chlorinator systems and touring different WaterStep projects. The early graduation also meant that Westlake could attempt to summit Mount Everest — which she did, becoming the youngest American woman in history to do so.
“I was like, ‘Wow, I did it,”’ Westlake told the Daily Trojan in June. “I was just really proud of myself and I was thinking about how proud my family and friends would be of me, especially my family, who invested so much in me.” 
A mountaineer since age seven, Westlake has also summited the highest point in all 50 U.S. states, and is currently attempting to complete the Explorers Grand Slam, a challenge to reach the highest point on all seven continents plus the north and south poles.
It’s not always smooth sailing, though. Westlake said that earlier in her climbing career, she’d often have to work to prove that she belonged on the mountains.
“Especially with my age and then also being a woman in the mountains — and I’m just small [in] stature in general — people just kind of assume when they look at me that I’m going to be the weakest on the team,” Westlake said. “I’ve learned to just kind of be like, ‘Okay, that can be what you think at first, but I’m gonna prove you wrong.’” 
Often that means going out of her way to help out fellow climbers or jump at jobs that others don’t want to pick up. Although, as one might expect, Westlake said that summiting Everest tends to open doors.
So what’s it like for a genuine minor celebrity to study at USC while juggling her water advocacy, mountaineering and Division I DI running? 
“It’s been hard for sure,” Westlake said. “With the semester off after high school, I kind of just got to do what I wanted: I went and climbed mountains, I went to Africa … But now that I’m in school, it’s like, no free time. I just run from one activity to the next.”
She has faith that everything will pay off in the long run, she said — she’s a public policy major, and wants to work on the policy side of addressing the world water crisis — but it can certainly be hard to balance all of her outside-of-school ambitions while cramming for midterms or waking up early for cross country practice. (Though luckily, Westlake said that her running doubles as her mountaineering training.)
In the first two cross country meets of the season, Westlake has quickly established herself as a star of the women’s distance running program, placing highest on the team in every race. 
So what’s next for Westlake? In December, she hopes to summit Carstensz Pyramid in Papua New Guinea, then reach the North Pole in April and the South Pole in December 2023 — all part of the Explorers Grand Slam. (Her Instagram handle is aptly titled @whatsnextlucy.) 
For now, though, she’s working with her sports agent to find sponsors to provide the funds to make the expeditions possible in the first place.
“Mountaineering especially is a very exclusive sport — there aren’t a lot of women in the mountains, there aren’t a lot of young people,” Westlake said. “The best way to make it more inclusive is to just show that it can be done … I just want to motivate people to climb their own mountains.”

The memory of entering USC’s campus for the first time is probably a pinnacle moment for most students here. Being blinded by the beating Los Angeles sun that reflects off the breathtaking buildings, students adorned in flashy brands zipping past on skateboards and your charismatic tour guide adamantly reinforcing that USC’s impact is just as impressive as its exterior. What hit me — harder than said students speeding posthaste along Trousdale Parkway—was just how not-so-impressive some facets are. 
As a student pursuing my Bachelor of Arts degree in art in the Roski School of Art and Design, it is overwhelmingly apparent which programs at USC receive the most endowments and funding (spoiler alert: I am pretty certain that we are not one of them). 
Unfortunately, since I was accepted into USC during the pandemic and then delayed my attendance by transferring in as a sophomore, I never got the false pretense of an iconic USC tour. Instead, I fell for the carefully crafted images and promises on the website. 
My first experience on campus was with my parents after move-in, and it started off the same as everyone else’s—smiling brightly with wide eyes at the impressive buildings, rethinking my entire wardrobe and feeling as though I would be set up for success after my years of studying here. However, my excitement instantaneously dimmed upon arriving at my destination south of campus. 
I can still hear the sharp inhale my mom sucked in, and can still remember how my dad looked puzzled and asked, “Oh…this it?” accompanied by nervous laughter. I proceeded to stand in front of Roski’s Watt and Harris Halls and reinstate the smile I had when I passed by the buildings of the Marshall School of Business, Gould School of Law and Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. 
The building feels old—and not that cool, gothic-esque old that seems unique and vintage— just old. Plain, a bit quiet and dreary, seemingly tucked away in the back of campus. I remember looking at my parents, thinking, “No, no, this cannot possibly be right. Where’s the vibrancy? The inspiration? The physicality of paying over $60,000 a year to attend an institution in sunny California of all places?” 
Well, I was rudely awakened that those promises do exist—just not for my school.
After journeying to practically every building on a fun, yet stressful adventure to finish off my apartment meal plan, I discovered that USC lives up to its physical reputation in other parts of its campus.
Marshall has tablets outside of nearly every room to show its spatial occupancy. Gould has its own (extremely difficult to find) café with an extensive menu. Annenberg has an entire newsroom with accessible, state-of-the art technology. Roski has an abandoned C&G Juice Co. shop since it was moved to Ronald Tutor Campus Center.
My qualms are not with Roski as an institution. Access to 24-hour studio spaces, printing labs, education from established artists and access to the Fisher Museum and on-campus galleries are nothing to complain about. What makes me hesitant about expressing any sort of USC pride—which is already difficult enough considering the price of merchandise at the bookstore—is that USC does not seem to take pride in the fine arts. 
Visual arts are notorious for taking the backburner when it comes to school funding. 
According to The Guardian education correspondent Sally Weale, cuts and lack of resources for the arts sends the signal that “the arts are not a strategic priority.”
This is no exception when it comes to USC. Roski does not get a career fair that occupies the entirety of Trousdale like the Viterbi School of Engineering. Our opportunities appear on a password-protected website. Roski does not get well-known speakers for shows and panels like the School of Cinematic Arts and School of Dramatic Arts; we get talks strictly in the Arts District, a $20 Lyft ride away. Roski does not get necessary resources covered like Annenberg; we must purchase supply kits up to nearly $200 per studio class. 
I remember introducing myself as an art major last year and being met with confused stares and having to explain that yes, USC does, in fact, have an art school and no, it is not a part of Dornsife (Yes. Someone asked me this.).
These disparities are not going unnoticed, but they are going unchanged. I find it extremely discouraging to be reminded each time that I walk on campus that the visual arts, quite ironically, lack visibility. It feels as though I was secretly handed the tail end of USC’s shining glory, enough to sound ungrateful if I complain, yet unfulfilling when compared to the rest of the University. 
It really is a shame considering the amazing creations that both Roski students and professors produce and are involved in. All-nighters in studios resulting in independent and class exhibitions on campus, works in local galleries, published pieces and more.
Let our exterior embody our work. Let our resources reflect our dedication. Let the visual arts be visible. It’s the least the University can do.

Two weeks ago, I tuned in to my favorite comfort show, “Abbott Elementary,” as it returned for its second season. The mockumentary-style comedy chronicles the shenanigans of various teachers at an underfunded elementary school run by a selfish and mordant principal. A soon-to-be classic sitcom, creator and star Quinta Brunson has quickly captured the laughs of many as “Abbott Elementary” was nominated for several Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series. 
Achieving such high acclaim is impressive but not without its downsides. Following the Robb Elementary School shooting in Uvalde, Texas, many people were outraged at the loss of 19 children and two teachers due to the lack of gun control and the warning signs of prevailing shootings. Naturally, many concerned citizens were compelled to act in order to relieve the trauma engendered by shootings and to prevent future ones.
The mode of achieving such change is varied. Last May, as people witnessed the horrifying scenes in Uvalde, many fans of “Abbott Elementary” tweeted at Brunson. 
“For the eventual series finale, a school shooting episode to highlight the numerous ones in the nation,” an anonymous fan said via private message sent to Brunson. “Formulate an angle that would get our government to understand why laws need to pass. I think Abbott Elementary can affect change. I love the show.” 
Brunson posted this message in a thread on Twitter because of these tasteless and redundant requests. 
“Wild how many people have asked for a school shooting episode of the show I write. People are that deeply removed from demanding more from the politicians they’ve elected and are instead demanding ‘entertainment,’” Brunson tweeted. “I can’t ask ‘are yall ok’ anymore because the answer is no.”
These requests must be dissected carefully. On the one hand, these fans believe themselves valid — a dutiful request as citizens in order to enact change politically through entertainment. On the other hand, however, these requests are thoughtless and superficial. Demanding show creators to use their medium as a form of activism is fair, but their efforts could have easily been used to pressure actual politicians to enact change. Writing an episode depicting a school shooting will do nothing but retraumatize viewers, especially because in the U.S., the fear of mass shootings has become a universal one.
Many treat representation in film and television as harbingers for social justice and equity when actual policies fail to follow suit. Unfortunately for many people with good intentions, media representation has become a more legitimate means of enacting social change than actual political action. 
Film and television can be powerful engines for informing inquisitive minds about social injustices, but by no means is it a requirement. Following Jordan Peele’s “Get Out” (2017), audiences confronted the terrifying and transforming racial tensions Black people face in a “I don’t see color” white private sphere. Watching Bong Joon-Ho’s “Parasite”(2019), we understood how issues with economic systems transcend across borders, showing how the lower class is unraveled by a capitalist system where few thrive off the hands of many. While the issues these films discuss are timely and salient, they intend to show, depict and understand the issues at hand—certainly not solve them. 
The problem is our expectations of film and television. Yes, feature length films and widestream sitcoms have large audience reaches. Yes, when they talk about social issues, they have the potential of sparking change through thoughtful discussions of the medium. Yes, Hollywood is pushing for more diversity in front of and behind the camera. However, we cannot expect film and television to do the work for us. We cannot forget that our individual efforts play a vital role in political change. 
“Abbott Elementary” is my comfort show that doesn’t require a needlessly traumatizing episode for an extremely inclusive cast and characters I have come to care for. For now, I am going to continue watching the second season because watching it feels like being hugged by a warm blanket. And, in a world where every time I log in to Twitter, I am faced with another pressing issue, I take refuge in “Abbott Elementary” because frankly, we all need an escape somehow.
