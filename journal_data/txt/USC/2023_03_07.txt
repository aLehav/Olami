USC picked up its fourth win in a row by routing Villanova 15-4 at McAlister Field Sunday. In the four-game stretch, the Trojans have outscored their opponents 63-27. 
With 4 points, the Wildcats scored the lowest number of points against the Trojans since 2019. Villanova attempted just 15 shots compared to USC’s 28.
Coming into the game, Wildcat sophomore attacker Sydney Pappas was the reigning Intercollegiate Women’s Lacrosse Coaches Association co-offensive player of the week. However, the Trojans managed to limit her to just 1 goal in the entire match. 
USC caused 17 of Villanova’s 22 turnovers and forced two shot-clock violations.
“Our defense is so rock solid,” said Head Coach Lindsey Munday after the game. “When [our defenders] ramped up their pressure, I think we kind of rattled them a little bit and caused some chaos.”
Three of the four defensive Trojan starters caused multiple turnovers. Graduate defender Emma Wightman forced 3, while senior defenders Olivia Dooley and Danielle Carson each tacked on 2 more.
“We really have so much trust in each other and we know our capabilities,” Carson said. “And we know we can keep teams under 5, 4 goals.”
In the cage, junior goalie Kait Devir played for most of the game, recording 4 saves and earned the winning decision. 
Offensively, seven different Trojans found the net. USC shot for 54% from the field, while the Wildcats shot just 27%. 
Junior attacker Maggie Brown scored a career-high 4 goals along with 2 assists. 
“[Brown] … just provides great energy,” Munday said. “I mean, she’s just so fun to be around and when she plays loose and has fun, that’s when she’s her best.” 
Coming off the bench, Brown quickly made an impact, scoring the first goal of the game in the first quarter.  The Minnesota native scored 2 more goals in the second half, contributing to an 8-0 run by the Trojans. The scoring streak convinced the referees to start the running clock. 
Redshirt sophomore attacker Isabelle Vitale scored a hat trick and had 2 assists. Vitale and Brown are tied with a team-leading 9 goals on the season.
“We’re really dynamic,” Munday said. “Each game has multiple goal-scorers. So I just think it’s really hard to stop them when they don’t have to focus on one person or two people.” 
In the draw circle, both sides won 11 times, despite the lopsided score. Sophomore midfielder Christina Gagnon got the lion’s share with five victories.
USC moves to 4-1 overall and 100-17 against unranked opponents. The Trojans are currently on an 11-game winning streak against unranked opponents at home. 
The win against Villanova marks the second time this season the Trojans have handed an opponent their first loss on the season.
“For each team, we try to just keep the same mindset,” Carson said. “Yeah, they’re a good competitor, but we know that we can beat them this year and we just got to be confident, do everything we’ve been doing and just work together.”
USC will face No. 15 Princeton away at Sherrerd Field Friday. The Tigers are 2-2 and are coming off a 15-10 loss against No. 22 Yale.

If you’ve had any exposure to aquatic sports on campus, the name Tilly Kearns will immediately bring a smile to your face. Kearns, a double-redshirt junior water polo player and Olympian, is an active social media user whether she’s playing in Tokyo or right here in Los Angeles. Her energy can only be described as positively electric, but does that persona really live up to the real thing? 
After a heart to heart with Kearns, I can attest that it does. 
With the origins of her water polo career came Kearns’ positive and humble attitude. She dove into aquatic success at a young age, and hasn’t been out of the pool since. 
“As soon as I started [water polo], I loved it straight away,” Kearns said. “I would swim and I played all the sports as a kid, but as soon as I tried water polo, I figured that was the one for me.” 
Kearns’ future in water polo, which has since earned her opportunities to play across the world from Australia to L.A., was not entirely predicted — if at all. Two members of USC’s 2013 championship team, Hannah Buckling and Anni Espar, were the root of Kearns’ knowledge of USC’s program, and the rest is history. 
“They put it on the radar and they said, ‘Hey, you should look at this school, the coach is looking for players,’” Kearns said. “[The coach] reached out to them and said, ‘Is there anyone who you think would be a good fit at USC?’ and they put my name forward, so it kind of happened by accident.” 
USC wasn’t Kearns’ only draw to come to the United States for college. A change of scenery and coaching style were necessary for Kearns’ ultimate goal: the Olympics. 
“Ultimately, I chose to go to the States in the first place because I wanted to make the Olympics, and I knew that if I stayed in Sydney, where I’d grown up and I’d done the same training my whole life … I wouldn’t have been good enough to make that team,” Kearns said. “I came here knowing that the caliber of coaches would get me to the Olympics, and ultimately they did.” 
The Tokyo 2020 Olympics, despite its delays regarding the coronavirus pandemic, was the pure exemplification of Kearns’ childhood dream to be an Olympian. 
“I grew up watching my dad, who was a professional rugby player,” Kearns said. “I would see him singing the anthem with his team standing arm-in-arm, and then see all of his archived photos and stuff like that, so I knew from the get-go that I wanted to be an Olympian.” 
Kearns describes her father, Phil Kearns, as her hero, and someone who had an attitude on and off the field that she wanted to replicate in her own sport. 
“It was sort of subconscious, but I always just really admired him,” Kearns said. “I’m very grateful because he was never that parent that pushed me towards something or gave me unsolicited advice — he always just took the backseat and I guess he was really proud of me, but he didn’t really make it that known, he just let me forge my own path.” 
Another quality Kearns’ parents instilled in her was humility, something often taken for granted among collegiate athletes. These young people are put on a pedestal for their whole lives because of their incredible skill in their sport. This can, in many cases, lead to an inflated ego and a cocky attitude, but Kearns is the prime example of an exception. 
“I think being humble is a hugely important trait,” Kearns said. “That’s something my dad and my mom had both sort of instilled in me to, you know, achieve quietly.” 
“Achieving quietly” — a new quote added to my own very low-stakes club sports pre-game ritual — is a pillar of Kearns’ success and something engrained in her team at USC. 
“That’s what’s so special about this program, is that we do play for each other,” Kearns said. “My teammates work for me, I work for them … It goes hand in hand, and I think that’s what separates us from a lot of other colleges.” 
USC’s water polo programs are legendary in the aquatic sports world. With seven National Championships and multiple almost-championships over the past few years, the Trojans are eager to prove themselves this season. The pressure adds to the excitement, Kearns said, especially when they face the team who has knocked them out of first place in multiple championship finals. 
“We lost to Stanford [over] the weekend and that one really hit home because the only team I’ve ever lost to with the Trojans is Stanford,” Kearns said. “Every time I play them there is pressure there, but I love it.” 
The saying “pressure makes diamonds” is true in the world of sports. Those final moments of game time, where the crowd is cheering and the coaches are screaming and the refs are frantically trying to get everyone in line. When two foes are tied with just seconds to go before the final buzzer. When the game-winning goal is just a stroke away. That is the pressure that makes diamonds of these moments in the pool for Kearns. 
“I’ve never been the one to put a lot of unnecessary pressure on myself, but if I do, I do it intentionally because I feel like I do play my best when there’s pressure on me,” Kearns said. “I think this season feels very different to the first two because I’ve lost two national championships in the final game, and they’ve been close games, they’ve been against the same opponent, so now I’m sick of losing and I really want to win — that’s always in the back of my mind.” 
A strong will to win and a team-oriented mindset are what will potentially earn Kearns a National Championship in a few short months, both things she already possesses. Her life in the sport of water polo speaks for itself in terms of success — this is just the next chapter. Kearns’ respect for her past, her program and her progress are what make her a champion. 
But a ring would be nice, too. 
“I’m pretty proud of my younger self — I think I always kept a pretty level headed mind to my water polo,” Kearns said. “There hasn’t really been a point where I have been really suffering with … my identity as a player, so I am really proud of little Tilly for getting me here.”

The No. 4 Trojans triumphed during the Pac-12 South Invitational tournament at home this weekend, securing the sweep and improving to 6-0 so far this season.
“You’re feeling great. You’re undefeated. You play a lot of great opponents, and we got through a lot of tests,” Head Coach Dain Blanton said. “A lot of people wanted to write us off. Like they had this great team and now they’re down. SC is down, SC is down. Well, I guess this is down.”
The Trojans kicked off their weekend with a 3-2 victory against No. 12 UC Berkeley early Saturday morning. The Trojans split the first flight, with a three-set win from junior Olivia Bakos and freshman Gabby Walker on court four securing the Trojans’ first point of the dual. 
USC closed out the dual in the second flight, with straight-set wins on court one from juniors Megan Kraft and Delaynie Maple and on court five from freshman Delaney Karl and graduate student Ashlyn Rasnick-Pope.
“Everyone did such a good job,” senior Audrey Nourse said. “We were there for each other and we played for each other. It was just an unforgettable experience.”
USC followed up its morning victory with a tough 3-2 win against No. 7 Stanford to round out their first day of action. The Trojans fell behind 0-2 after the first flight following close, three-set losses on courts two and four. The Trojans battled back in the second flight, though, with hard-fought three-set victories from Kraft and Maple on court one, Karl and Walker on court five and seniors Audrey and Nicole Nourse on court three. 
“A match is such a long thing,” Blanton said. “You come out, you play poorly, you start a new set. You can be back in and doing your thing, and so that’s how we look at it. Every set is different. Let’s focus on the set right in front of us.”
In their first match Sunday morning, USC stayed undefeated, taking down No. 16 Washington 4-1. Kraft and Maple continued their hot streak at court one, as did the Nourse twins on court three and Karl and Walker on court five. Bakos won her first match on court four paired with freshman Bailey Showalter. 
The Trojans continued to struggle on court two: USC is 1-5 on the second court this season, with the pairing of graduate student Madison “Maddog” Shields and freshman Madison White looking for their first win after taking over from the Nourse twins. 
The Trojans closed out the weekend with a nail-biting dual against crosstown rival and No. 1 ranked UCLA. The Trojans continued their first-flight struggles and fell behind to an early 2-0 deficit. The Trojans battled back in the second flight, though, and secured a straight-set victory on court one and a three-set victory on court five, before the Nourse twins wrapped up the dual with a 17-15 victory in the third set on court three.
“I’m at a loss for words,” Audrey Nourse said. “There was a second there at the end line where I looked across and I saw the stands just packed and I thought to myself that I would remember this moment forever. To be here at home and win at home was really special.”
For the Trojans, who lost much of their starting roster last year, the season’s first victory against UCLA was extra special.
“It’s so fun to play in the rivalry game,” Blanton said. “Anytime we play it and it’s so fun. And for seven freshmen and 10 transfers to experience that bell, it means a lot and it pays dividends down the road.”
The Trojans will return to action for the Battle for LA Invitational tournament Saturday at 10 a.m. at Merle Norman stadium.

“Welcome to another day in my life!” “Get ready with me!” 
While I won’t deny my part in curating a TikTok feed filled with these façaded videos, who would’ve thought a platform like TikTok would gain so many consistent users and become culturally embedded among Gen Z?
On average, TikTok users spend 1.5 hours a day consuming back-to-back short-form videos, totaling to 10.5 hours per week. According to Statistica’s January 2023 TikTok data analysis, women between the ages of 18 and 24 constitute 22% of the app’s global audience, while men ages 18 to 24 represent about 17%. 
Gen Z is the most easily influenced, which creates the perfect platform for businesses to recruit people whose only job is to impact the people that watch their videos. But what and who are these social stars really influencing? Many popular figures rose to fame because of their appearances and unrealistic, materialistic lifestyles. Meanwhile, it seems users who share educational and practical resources hardly have a comparable following or engagement.
Specifically in conversation about my first-generation peers, I know all too well the struggle of choosing between a career that’s creative and compelling and one that’ll guarantee certainty and financial comfort. This struggle, combined with a digital world and reality that emphasizes a social scene that is consistently in the limelight, makes it exponentially easier to question the all-nighters spent in libraries when your peers seemingly couldn’t be bothered to do the same. In this way, TikTok has become a pivotal platform documenting personal journeys, but has also become a way to network and connect with ambitious, like-minded peers. 
Just within the L.A. community, Edgar Rodriguez, a local first-generation Mexican immigration attorney, posted on LinkedIn around a month ago celebrating the establishment of his law firm. Witnessing this achievement assured me that it is possible for my undocumented peers and family members to dream and achieve without borders. This sentiment is similar to the mission of QuestBridge, a non-profit organization that connects high achieving first-generation students with Ivy League and T20 educational institutions. Seeing their College Prep Scholars and National College Match TikToks on my For You feed brings me so much joy.
On a similar note, while I am open about my chronic vision disability, many don’t know that I was born blind in my left eye and have degrading vision in my right. Where my limited vision lacks, I take photos and videos of my day-to-day life. In this way, I hope to have an auditory mode of retaining my favorite memories come the day I do lose my remaining sight. While there isn’t a tangible digital community of users with disabilities in media, I am certain I am not the only TikTok user who has a disability. One of the most inspiring content creators I follow is Sadaya Paige (@foreversadayapaige on TikTok and @sadayapaige on Instagram). An 11-year-old pianist and singer who was born blind, Paige doesn’t let her disability stop her from navigating her childhood and passion for music.  I played piano for 13 years before quitting my music program because I was unable to perceive advanced music theory and sheet music. Even though I am half as able, I am left in awe and inspired by Paige’s choice to fearlessly pursue a passion that once brought me so much joy.
I believe there is something for everyone on social media. When we choose to scroll and consume media as a growth or community platform rather than mind-numbing entertainment, we begin to create an algorithm of not just influencers, but empowerers. You have the power to choose to be or not be influenced. I challenge you to use your platform to not just influence, but to empower.

I lost a piece of who I was. Desperate to fit in, to conform to this new world I was in, I sacrificed my identity because my desperation was too great. Now, I look back and regret that I made that choice, the choice to diminish something that was authentically me: my Nigerian accent.
I was coming to the land of the free — a land flowing with milk and honey. I was ecstatic to come to the United States and knew I’d have to adapt to a new environment, but I was oblivious to the pain that would follow me to this day from trying to fit in. 
Starting in fifth grade, the bullying came even though I tried to adopt an American accent — if you’re wondering, it was a horrible attempt. As I went through middle school, the mockery followed. Common remarks were, “Why does she talk like that?” and “She sounds so weird.” One might imagine that I was heartbroken. More than that, I felt ashamed to be Nigerian, often trying to distance myself from my culture when I was in public. Looking back on it, I wish I could have told myself to “Embrace the accent! Embrace your culture! Embrace you!”
 So, eight years later, as I was walking to class and saw a sign for “accent elimination,” you’d probably guess that your girl was not too happy. I was annoyed and frustrated that someone was trying to do to other immigrants and international students what happened to me for years. However, instead of unorganized bullying, it was a curated plan. I did not want to make assumptions, so I reached out to John Jones, a USC alum, who offers the service. 
International students who were classmates of Jones sought him out and told him they felt like their accent got in the way of their success and that they wanted to change how they spoke. Charging $50 an hour for the service, Jones said that there were positive effects of the service he offers, and is that the students who come to him feel like there is a mystery being moved out of the way when they talk. 
“It’s what you deliver much more than what it sounds like, much more than what you think, so it had to do with your confidence, building a confidence instead of delivering … good solid information, that’s what we’re here for,” Jones said. 
While Jones means well, changing the way someone sounds is not the solution to the problem. If society can’t look past their accent, even though they speak perfect English with insightful and intelligent contributions to give, it makes society the problem. According to Forbes contributor Adi Gaskell, “Accents not only help us to distinguish where someone may originate from, but also influence how we perceive their character and their capabilities.” In a study conducted in the United Kingdom that Gaskell cited, led by University of Bern professor Erez Levon, 46% of employees surveyed reported higher levels of being mocked for their accent in social settings with 47% of university students reporting the same experience. This resulted in understandable levels of anxiety about one’s speech and the accent that was gifted. 
Now, not all immigrants feel the desire or need to change how they speak or behave because of their accents, like Bernifka Saint Jean, a senior majoring in business administration. Saint Jean immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti when she was nine and was surrounded by a predominantly Haitian community. Because of this, she did not feel like she had to change how she talked and who she was in order to fit into American society. 
“I never really tried to change my accent. I feel like now it’s more faded. People don’t recognize it as much but when people do it’s not something I’m embarrassed of, and I think that’s because of the space I was raised in,” Saint Jean said. “By the time I finished eighth grade [and] moved on to the high school, the Haitian class ahead of me, I guess they made Haitian, like being Haitian, cool.”
Although she struggled with learning English when she initially moved to the U.S., being understood by a core group of her Haitian friends and students in her high school seeking to learn more about her culture allowed her to adapt better to America. 
As immigrants, we can’t and shouldn’t let people’s prejudice and ignorance affect how we live our beautiful lives. You get to choose who you surround yourself with so choose those who won’t judge you for who you are and how you speak. Be the boss babes you are and do what you want, not what others want you to do.

Every morning, we make decisions: Do we press snooze? Should we really buy another Starbucks coffee for the extra 20 stars? How appealing does lecture sound today? 
This decision between A or B or C obviously applies to outfits as well, but not in the way that you might think. For me, at least, when picking out tops to pair with skirts or my trusty Baggy Dad jeans, I always consider what kind of bra I wear underneath. Should I wear a sports bra? If I wear this bralette, is the color too bright under my white T-shirt? The bra is supposed to provide some comfort and support, not necessarily be a part of the outfit itself. 
I was never hyper-aware of that final thought until I saw an ad from a vintage lingerie reseller. The bra was beautifully crafted, and the literal silhouette and architectural shaping of the waving lines were breathtaking. Learning it was an older La Perla piece sealed the deal.  I decided that this was one of those unique pieces that would push my creative intellect and capability, so I immediately inquired about measurements to the seller. 
I was head over heels and began daydreaming about how I would style it. I felt it would be beautifully paired with a tube top a la Tae Park, with a bolero inspired by Giambattista Valli RTW S/S 17, over a simple, white button-down or under a blazer. 
Still, I was too scared to hit “checkout,” and another buyer promptly snatched her up. When I talked to my friends about my regret from not purchasing, I realized it wasn’t hesitancy over shipping risks, seller fraud or general cleanliness — I did my research on the seller — but rather from questioning how much I would even wear it the way I envisioned in my head. 
I wanted the bra to be shown off and appreciated by others the same way I did, but I knew it never would for two reasons: I would be a woman wearing a bra, and I was too scared because of that. 
I felt that with lingerie becoming more casual in Gen Z specifically — especially with the normalization of underwear as outerwear as people regularly style and incorporate garters, bustiers, corsets and bra-tops into their silhouettes — I too would feel that reclaiming and feminine empowerment. Still, while I’ve made mood boards and gushed over Prada denim bra-tops, GCDS’s dewdrop bralettes and Isa Boulder’s knit garters, even if I had the funds I still wouldn’t buy them out of the same fear.
I wanted to reflect further, maybe in an effort to avoid studying for midterms, and started at the very base. Was it insecurity — the way they sat on my shorter torso or the way I saw myself? Or rather, was it the discomfort of straying from what I was taught and what I knew? 
The former was and is still completely valid, but I’ve been on a journey of loving myself where I don’t tolerate negative self-talk. But the latter thoughts struck me in my chest a little more. I thought, then, it could be the fear of being perceived in a hypersexual way, or simply a lack of confidence. 
When envisioning myself in my dream outfits with the La Perla bra, even my imagined self didn’t have the confidence to pull them off, feeling instead like a little girl trying on women’s dresses that swallow me whole. But after some Trader Joe’s “Hold the Cones” and a phone call with a friend from home, I realized that this lack of confidence was rather a cultural installment, not my internal conscience. 
Growing up in Japan was a fantastic experience; the culture has greatly shaped my morals, being a polyglot keeps my internal dialogue interesting and I got to grow up in a bustling city that pushed cultural norms while maintaining general respect and a strong sense of community. But, of course, there were still downsides: I was further scrutinized for my mistakes because I was a foreigner, I was more frequently targeted for shady side-hustles to hold foreigners for a ransom of insanely overpriced faux watches and bags in alleyways, and my clothing choices — when not in my uniform — were of utmost importance. 
I was taught very early on to remain modest, especially as a young lady: blend into the crowd, avoid hostile people and if I felt unwelcome somewhere, I probably was and should leave. Still, as I grew older and visited the United States more, I thought that the growing progressive style in Japan meant I too could experiment with my fashion, opting for spaghetti straps and dresses that fell just above my knees. 
Disregarding the fact that my parents saved me from some horrible fashion choices, I wasn’t yet mentally prepared for the stares and uncomfortable energy that I would receive. Those glares, scanning glances and paranoia from the sound of phone shutters targeting me made me immediately purchase more modest clothes and wear them out of the store. 
Regardless, I don’t blame Japan or anyone for instilling in me this way of thinking and approaching clothes; every culture and society has the ugly to accompany its utopic perception, and viewing people, places or things through rose-tinted lenses is unhelpful and (possibly) dangerous. But just because there’s no entity to blame doesn’t mean that reflection and self-improvement can’t occur. 
That’s one of the best things about those late-night Depop browsing and Pinterest scrolling sessions: You never know what pieces will spark which emotions or trains of thought. I’ve just gone through my second fashion puberty and am ready to begin my next phase of exploration — recently being drawn to accent pieces and statement jewelry — but have not yet felt comfortable enough to wear innerwear as outerwear. 
And maybe I never will, but through these moments of reflection, I feel content with this open-ended possibility. Style is neither definable nor containable, rather it’s constantly fluctuating — so, who’s to say tomorrow might not be the day?

Amid Downtown’s graffiti-stained alleyways and scattered abandoned buildings, heart-pumping bass rumbled through the streets, inviting passionate techno enthusiasts into the warehouse to get a taste of rising South Sudanese producer Skin On Skin’s first performance in Los Angeles Friday night, presented by Into The Woods and Lights Down Low.
Inside the venue, viewers were welcomed by multicolored flashing lights, fog enveloping the bobbing heads in the crowd and music flowing from speakers so loud that one could feel each beat in their bones. Despite being shoulder-to-shoulder with barely any room to breathe, the electrifying crowd took in every beat, dancing wildly with drops of sweat glinting on their foreheads and backs fueled only by the music. The crowd slowly turned into a kaleidoscopic sight, creating a psychedelic blend of colorful outfits and rainbow-colored blinking lasers. The opening performers, Keenan and Jimmy Maheras, played their own music, preparing the audience for the main attraction with arrays of techno and club-house beats.
As it got closer to dawn, viewers waited in anticipation for Skin On Skin while enjoying the tunes and drinking cocktails from the makeshift bar. As Keenan’s set came to an end, even louder cheers and excitement diffused through the crowd, welcoming Skin On Skin. The producer dramatically emerged from the darkness donning only a simple black cap and white T-shirt, taking over the DJ booth while seamlessly transitioning from Keenan’s tracks to his own top hits. 
Following his breakout Boiler Room performance in June 2022, the Australia-based South Sudanese producer has been making waves all over the internet, sparking great enthusiasm from techno and house enjoyers worldwide. 
The audience whooped with fervor for Skin On Skin’s show. The producer started off strong with a special performance of an unreleased track, “Eye For An Eye,” that he debuted at his iconic Boiler Room performance. The track is a remix of “Come Outside” by Omizz, Td and Jojo from TPL. The UK-based drill-rap collective’s sounds expertly combined with a strong buildup of synth melody riled the passionate crowd even more with exhilaration and admiration for the producer.
Skin On Skin provided a fresh spin to the Australian electronic scene, even catching the attention of Mall Grab, a producer widely regarded as one of house music’s most adored names internationally — representing Australia on the world stage. Mall Grab collaborated with Skin On Skin to create one of his most popular tracks, “Strangers.” Skin On Skin’s classic percussive beats combined with Mall Grab’s signature muted melodies created a mystifying masterpiece. 
As Skin On Skin continued to play his set, the warehouse got even more crowded with fans looking forward to listening to the artist’s top tracks. The artist played fan favorites, including the aforementioned “Strangers,” as well as other popular tracks like “For Tha Shot,” “Slow It Down” and “Walk Up To Yo House,” to the pleasure of the audience. To provide variety and retain enthusiasm throughout the night, Skin On Skin snuck in a few sneak peeks of unreleased remixes of pop songs and other UK drill songs.
The thunderous kick drums masterfully blended with a synth melody and pitch-shifted vocal samples to reduce music down to its most simplistic and effective fashion — emblematic of Skin On Skin’s signature specialty. Delivering the same structure throughout most of his tracks, the audience only got more excited as he played each song, letting the music transport them into their own world, only listening to the pounding bass and dancing their hearts away. Drill-infused techno tracks may sound strange in theory, but in Skin On Skin’s expert hands, the seamless beats are pure art. 
Throughout the night, Skin On Skin visibly relished in pure excitement from the intoxicating crowd, a smile plastered on his face every time the beat dropped. The buildup of the entire set ended with Skin On Skin performing his most popular track with more than 9 million streams on Spotify, “Burn Dem Bridges,” closing the night with an adrenaline-fueled climax. Using the pitch-shifted vocal sample from Sav’o and Horrid1’s “Violent Siblings,” the final hurrah caused mass pandemonium on the dance floor, warmly welcoming the South Sudanese producer to the City of Angels.

All this could only mean one thing: Sketchella was back. 
The largest collegiate comedy festival on the West Coast, created by the sketch comedy troupe Fourth Quarter All-Stars in 2018, brought comedy troupes from campuses across the country together and shined a light on USC’s comedy scene. This past weekend marked the fifth time the festival was held. 
“The biggest thing is trying to foster a spirit of community among the different sketch groups because you’re only as good as your best competitor,” said Arabella Varieur, a member of 4QAS and a freshman majoring in politics, philosophy and law. “It’s just nice to meet other people who are interested in the same thing as you and get to see their work and be inspired by them.”
This year, four of USC’s comedy troupes, two sketch — 4QAS and The Suspenders — and two improv — Commedus Interuptus and Spoiler Alert — took the stage at the Brain and Creativity Institute for two nights of non-stop comedy. Joining them in the action were Cal Poly SLO’s The Nightcap, UC Berkeley’s Bootleg Comedy, UCLA’s Shenanigans, Stanford’s Robber Barons and Emerson’s Jimmy’s Travelling All-Stars.
President of 4QAS Karan Menon, a senior majoring in narrative studies, began organizing the festival in December. Despite receiving “like no money” from USG and facing a University “skeptical” of whether the event could garner attendance, 4QAS remained determined to put on the festival, believing its work could finally earn the troupes the recognition they deserve.
“The level of comedy at USC is really high … but it doesn’t get enough credit for how good it is. There [are] classes for comedy and stuff, but I don’t think the school recognizes how strong the groups are on campus,” Menon said. “Sketchella was a way of bringing attention to the quality that’s on campus and around other colleges.”
The budget for the weekend came from the members’ own pockets, fundraising and “begging [their] families to donate to a GoFundMe.” 
“We were just told [by USG], ‘Oh, sorry, even though you applied for the grant or the funding by the deadline, like everyone else did, we just don’t have the funding,’” Varieur said. “A lot of other groups got told the same thing, which is like, good to know that we’re not special. But like, girl, it’s USC, where’s the money at?” 
Despite its monetary struggles, the troupe filled out the BCI for two nights and even secured Ben Schwartz (“Parks and Rec,” “Middleditch & Schwartz”) as a guest speaker. Throughout the weekend, the nine troupes spent time chatting, learning and, of course, laughing. 
4QAS tours the country every year, traveling to NYU, Northwestern and Stanford in past years, with the goal of learning from new groups and pushing its work further each year. Sketchella is another opportunity for the group to do so.
“Emerson’s group last year had some crazy sketches. Stanford, UCLA, all of them — they have really good ideas, and they change your perception of what is possible,” Menon said. “Because otherwise you’re just looking at ‘SNL’ for your inspiration and that can only get you so far … There’s also inspiration to look at around you.” 
Past years’ performers included ASU’s Tempe Underground and BYU’s Divine Comedy. Menon said there’s never been a shortage of groups interested in participating. Most are always looking for new opportunities to perform, but they just never considered cross-campus performances a possibility until 4QAS created it.
Melissa Beining, sketch co-head of the Shenanigans and a senior at UCLA majoring in political science, English and philosophy, received an invitation via DM. After discovering the festival would take place the day after their quarterly sketch show, she knew the tight schedule would be stressful, but also that her group absolutely had to make the trip from Westwood.
“[Sketchella] was a really great opportunity to not only show what we’ve been able to put together and what we can do and get some more stage minutes in, but also get some inspiration from other sketch groups, and get to see what else is out there in [Los Angeles] comedy scenes and throughout California, to hopefully give us more ideas for our future too,” Beining said. 
Many of the performers of the weekend never planned on getting involved with comedy on campus, but had it grow to be one of the most important parts of their lives, finding community and confidence through performance and workshopping.
For Maya Gardner, a junior majoring in theater and assistant director of The Suspenders, comedy is a way to get out of their head and comfort zone. As a perfectionist and a usually dramatic actor, Gardner’s work in sketch serves as a necessary outlet, reminding them that “nothing is that serious.”
“Comedy is mostly about the audience,” Gardner said. “As much as it is for the performers to get up there and show off their talent, having an audience there that you can feed off of the energy of and play off of things they shout at you and just get them involved in the piece. It brings it to life. And it’s what makes comedy so special.”
Menon said 4QAS plans to continue to host Sketchella annually, with hopes of the event growing each year. This weekend, cross-country comedians came together for a triumphant six hours of sketch and improvisation — creating friendships spanning campuses.
“Comedy is one of those things that really brings people together. It allows us to just kind of poke fun at everything,” said Vincent Demonte, a sophomore majoring in journalism and a member of The Suspenders. “Comedy is one of those things that’s timeless, and it’s just an art that survives ages.”

USC had a decent weekend on the diamond, winning two of their three games and dropping their Sunday matchup against crosstown rival UCLA.
However, the Trojans got a bit of revenge Saturday in their 13-8 win against Tulane, who beat USC in football in the Cotton Bowl Classic earlier this year. In a flurry of hits, walks and runs, a bundled-up crowd saw the USC baseball team take down the Green Wave. 
The Trojans recorded 13 hits in an offensive shootout that gave USC a winning record for the first time since Feb. 25. Senior designated hitter Nick Lopez and senior catcher Connor Clift led the team with 3 hits each.
Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz attributed the team’s success behind the plate to their ability to hit the ball in the middle of the field.
“That’s when we’re best, when we stay at the middle of the field,” Stankiewicz said. “Guys did a nice job of just booking them over the diamond, so we put some good swings together.”
It was Clift who brought in the first run for the Trojans, hitting a single in the bottom of the 2nd inning that allowed senior infielder Johnny Olmstead to put the Trojans on the board.
This came after a disastrous top of the 2nd inning, in which junior starting pitcher Jaden Agassi let up a walk, 4 hits and committed a fielding error in an attempt to pick off a Tulane player attempting to steal a base.
“[Agassi] is a big pivotal part of our program. We’re just trying to help him get through those tough innings,” Stankiewicz said. “We need him to go deeper, we need all of our starters to go in the 6th innings. So we’re just trying to encourage him to … just stay in the moment, make pitches more than anything else.”
Agassi let up a home run in the top of the 3rd but quickly retired the three following batters, setting up an explosive inning for the Trojan offense. USC scored 7 runs off of 4 hits, with freshman center fielder Austin Overn and redshirt freshman infielder Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek stealing bases.
Overn showed his perseverance when, in the 8th inning, he was struck by a ball that hit his bat. He stepped back from the plate, and an athletic trainer came over to look at him. Overn made it clear that he was okay, and on the next pitch hit a triple to bring home the final run of the Trojan’s 13-8 victory. 
“He’s a tough kid. He’s got some mentality, he’s got some skill and he can certainly run as good as anybody,” Stankiewicz said. “When he gets on base, it’s a threat for sure.” 
However, USC’s luck ran out on Sunday, losing 5-3 to UCLA. After a slow first 8 innings for the Trojans, whose offensive efforts yielded a single run despite having some success getting on base, a 2-run homer from junior pitcher/infielder Nate Clow injected life back into the USC dugout in the top of the 9th inning. 
Senior outfielder Cole Gabrielson and junior infielder Ryan Jackson both got base hits following Clow’s homer, but Lopez hit a pop fly that sank the Trojans’ chance at a comeback. 
Redshirt freshman pitcher Eric Hammond got the start and was credited with the loss after giving up 4 hits and 3 earned runs. 
The Trojans will next face the University of Nevada Wednesday at Dedeaux Field. First pitch is slated for 6:30 p.m.

Over the last several weeks, Los Angeles residents have faced atypical weather conditions, as rainstorms hit the city, bringing with them hail and snow. L.A. will face additional rain on Friday and next week, the Weather Channel projects.
In the course of two weeks, L.A. has faced rain, hail and warnings of blizzards and floods. The severe weather event caused mudslides, rockslides, flooded areas and icy roads, the California Department of Transportation wrote in a March 3 statement to the Daily Trojan.
“The past few months have certainly caused more damage than is typical by this time of year,” the statement read. “The [L.A.] area saw a number of closures and delays on our roadways, as well as damage to some infrastructure.
Michael Qi, a freshman majoring in electrical and computer engineering, said he was annoyed at the unexpected weather and felt unprepared for the quick change. 
“I grew up here, so I’m not really prepared for the rain,” Qi said. “It’s very inconvenient for me.”
For Cheska Pangilinan, a junior majoring in environmental studies, recent climate fluctuations have caused deeper concerns for the future. 
“[This is] definitely not a one-off event,” Pangilinan said. “This weird weather is going to become more frequent … as the climate crisis worsens.”
Infrastructure is an area that poses a unique challenge for USC. University Park Campus has already experienced the effects of unexpected rain: the Music Complex building, for one, was temporarily closed following flooding. 
A spokesperson for the University told the Daily Trojan that the recent storms had no major impacts on the University, including no power outages or infrastructural damages.
The weather caused flooding of some streets and highways across L.A. Colin Sweeney, the director of public information at the Los Angeles Department of Transportation, said drivers should not enter flooded streets or flooded areas. It takes only about six inches of water — especially if it’s flowing — to carry a car away, Sweeney said.
In its statement, Caltrans wrote that the agency was prepared for the storm’s impact, and maintenance and repair crews have quickly fixed most of the damage it caused.
“We know that closures and delays can be frustrating,” the statement read. “But we are asking the public for patience as our crews work tirelessly, sometimes in treacherous weather conditions, to restore our roadways.”
Some elements of L.A.’s infrastructure have functioned well amid strenuous weather conditions, said Adam Rose, director emeritus of the USC Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Threats and Emergencies. The cement-paved L.A. River, which often appears to only flow at a trickle, is meant to capture and carry away the water from heavy rain to avoid flooding, Rose said.
The recent storms have shown, though, that the city’s stormwater drainage systems are inadequate. Stormwater drain systems in L.A. were built to collect a certain amount of water, but the recent heavy rain has surpassed these levels and has led to flooding, said Rose, a research professor at the Sol Price School of Public Policy.
Drainage systems are just one aspect of California’s infrastructure that must be improved, Rose said. California received a C- in a 2019 infrastructure report card by the American Society of Civil Engineers. 
“Change in climate conditions has produced heavier rains, stronger storms and higher winds. This is the new normal,” the ASCE report read. “Old bridges were not designed for these loads.”
The severe weather will also have long-term impacts throughout L.A. County. In wildfire prone areas, the strong rain can cause a more robust growth of grasses and greenery, said Jorge Anaya, an emergency management coordinator for L.A. County’s Office of Emergency Management. 
The increased vegetation can become a problem when the wildfire season rolls around, making it especially important to monitor wildfire areas during the fire season, Anaya said. It’s important, he said, that L.A. residents manage the plants near their homes by maintaining a defensible space to protect property against wildfire. 
Rose said the United States has historically not been effective at maintaining its infrastructure.
“When budgets are tight, maintenance is one of the things that you give up first because it’s not broken yet,” Rose said. “Then you repair what actually breaks.”
While the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act — which includes billions of dollars to improve infrastructure across the nation —  would be a significant help, Rose said, there is still more that needs to be done to maintain and upgrade infrastructure systems in the U.S. 
“[The Inflation Reduction Act] is really just a start,” Rose said. “We need to do better than that.”
Correction: A previous version of this story read that “A spokesperson for the University declined the Daily Trojan’s request for comment on the recent storms citing no major impacts on the University, including no power outages or infrastructural damages.” This language incorrectly conveyed a lack of cooperation from the University; more aptly, the storms’ lack of impact was confirmed by the spokesperson, but simply did not warrant an official statement. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

Simon & Schuster suspended sales of USC oncologist David Agus’ upcoming book after the Los Angeles Times reported finding 95 instances of plagiarism in the book Monday.
In “The Book of Animal Secrets: Nature’s Lessons for a Long and Happy Life,” the L.A. Times found 95 separate passages that were lifted from uncredited sources. Agus and Simon & Schuster announced that sales would be suspended until a revised and corrected edition can be released.
The book borrowed unattributed content, sometimes word for word, from publications including the New York Times, Wikipedia, National Geographic and various academic institutions’ websites and scientific journals. The plagiarized content in question ranged from sentences to “several continuous paragraphs,” according to the article.
The book contained sentences from other scientists and presented them as Agus’ own. In addition to content from academic sources, the book contained uncredited material from smaller media outlets and blogs.
In interviews the L.A. Times conducted with experts in scientific integrity and forensic plagiarism, the experts noted that the plagiarism seemed like particularly “low-tech” cut and paste jobs, which is unusual given the recent innovations in artificial intelligence programs such as ChatGPT.
“The Book of Animal Secrets” was originally scheduled for release Tuesday. About a week before its release, the book hit number one on Amazon’s bestseller list for books about animals.
“I take any claims of plagiarism seriously,” Agus said in an apology statement.
In a statement to the Daily Trojan Monday, the Keck School of Medicine wrote that the University “takes allegations of plagiarism very seriously and has processes in place to review such matters,” but that it could not comment further “given the confidential nature of personnel matters.”
Agus is the director of the Lawrence Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine and the USC Center for Applied Molecular Medicine, and a professor of medicine and biomedical engineering. He also serves in leadership roles at the World Economic Forum and Global Health Security Consortium and has received acclaim for his innovations in medicine, including an Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2017.
Agus is a contributor to CBS News and the author of “The End of Illness,” “A Short Guide to a Long Life” and “The Lucky Years: How to Thrive in the Brave New World of Health.” A CBS News spokesperson told the L.A. Times that Agus currently has no appearances planned as the network looks into the matter.
