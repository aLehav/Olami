Recently, USC has received negative press about how administrators and the Dept. of Public Safety handle rape and sexual violence on campus. On July 22, a heavy-hitting article detailing USC’s failure to address rape complaints ran in the Huffington Post.
Several days after the article ran, Elizabeth Garrett, provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs, sent an email to the USC community responding to the article. In her letter, she stated that USC has “awareness programs for all students during Welcome Week and throughout the year on sexual violence.” She also mentioned that “confidential counseling and advocacy, and advice on obtaining medical care, are available through our Sexual Assault Resource Center,” and provided a number that victims can call 24/7.
Though USC has taken important steps to address these allegations, these efforts do not erase or attempt to change the abhorrent attitudes that USC officials expressed toward rape victims. A rape-normalizing culture exists at USC, and there are many more steps our school can take to promote a more respectful culture, support victims and punish offenders. USC can emerge as a pioneer in addressing rape culture at universities across America by implementing a three-pronged solution.
Step 1: Create a better understanding of “consent.” The single most effective way to prevent rape at our school is to ensure that all students know what rape means.
Sexual contact without consent is sexual assault, and there are three components to consent: one, the participant must be old enough to consent to sex — age 18 in California. Two, the participant must agree to the sexual contact. The frequently quoted guideline, “no means no,” while accurate, does not fully encompass this aspect of consent. Silence does not mean “yes” either. The safest way to handle this is to go by the rule, “yes means yes.”
The third component of consent is perhaps the most difficult to ascertain: both participants must have the capacity to consent. For example, certain mental illnesses can render an individual unable to legally consent to sex. Similarly, alcohol and drugs can render a person unable to consent to sex.
That’s not to say that all cases of drunk sex are rape. However, according to Title IX Section 261 of the California Codes, if alcohol prevents a person from resisting sex when they otherwise would not comply, and/or causes the person to be unconscious or asleep, having sex with them is legally rape.
This type of sexual assault is far more common than a creepy rapist lurking in an alley. The issue was brought to light by a Facebook page created by a USC student last year. The page, called USC Hookups, provided an open forum for students to anonymously post about their sexual exploits. The page received backlash from people who felt it was distasteful or even disgusting for students to share these intimate details. However, while exploiting one’s own sex life is a personal choice, the USC Hookups page also received criticism for trivializing and mocking rape.
One particular story from the page stirred controversy for making light of a clear case of rape. In the post,  a male student recounted a conversation with a girl he slept with the previous night. She asked him what happened the next morning, because she was so drunk that she blacked out. She asked him if she cheated on her boyfriend, and he said, “Definitely,” and laughed. She left crying.
One cannot expect cavalier attitudes toward rape to change if people do not know what rape is. USC already has sexual violence awareness programs during Welcome Week for freshmen, but clearly this is not enough.
Step 2: Provide more comprehensive support for victims. Currently, USC offers counseling and a 24-hour phone number for rape victims. Due to the high frequency of sexual assault on college campuses,  however, this is not enough support. One victim, who wished to remain anonymous, said the Engemann Student Health Center provided her no treatment whatsoever. They never conducted a medical examination or conducted blood or urine tests for date-rape drugs. The only counseling offered was a referral to the Center for Women & Men.
The establishment of a rape treatment center on campus as an extension of the new health center or the Center for Women & Men is critical.
Students who are raped on campus should have access to full, comprehensive victim care. Otherwise, students without a car would be burdened with finding transportation to a treatment center while dealing with the trauma of rape.
In addition, there must be a radical change in the way DPS officers initially respond to a rape victim. Appropriate first responses to rape allegations are compassionate, and do not blame the complainant. Sensitivity training for all DPS officers to prevent such highly inappropriate reactions to rape would be a good start.
Step 3: Enforce harsh punishments for offenders. Punishment for rape must be severe. Convicted rapists go to prison, so at the very least, USC should implement the harshest punishment possible from a school: expulsion.
Though USC is far from the only university in the United States with problematic attitudes towards rape, it can function as a pioneer in addressing the issue. By implementing processes and programs that treat every facet of rape culture, USC can lead the way in combating rape on college campuses.

It breaks my heart that this is what our university is known for right now. USC is such a great school, but unfortunately that’s being overlooked because of this misogynistic culture that has developed thanks to the frats’ general insistence on the objectification of women and the sororities’ general willingness to be objectified. We’re more proud to be known as the “University of Sexy Chicks” than we are of our leading academics. I know that people are hesitant to blame the Greeks, but as a GDI, I’m not afraid to say that the Row needs more patrolling because, and I do not think that it’s a stretch to say this, it’s getting to be out of control. Last year, after several people were taken to the hospital for alcohol poisoning on the same night, the Greek community was “punished” by being put on probation, meaning that for two weeks, students could only party on Friday and Saturday, and parties had to be approved by the University. That’s all. Also, this “rape culture” that USC is accused of harboring, is largely due to the severe and extreme objectification of women within fraternities. It wasn’t too long ago that USC was in the national news for a horrifyingly cruel and sexist email sent out among the Kappa Sig fraternity as well as graphic pictures of students (Greeks) having sex on the roof.  These incidences are just the tip of the iceberg; the most newsworthy stories of the chauvinism that is rampant on the row. It would seem that Greek parties are less about socializing and letting loose with our peers, and more about getting as many girls as drunk as possible to cater to the genitalia of the members of the frats.  Now, I realize that placing the blame solely on the Greeks is simplifying a complicated issue. I wish that there was a clear-cut villain in all of this that we could neatly point to for all of these problems, but that’s not the case. Yes, Greek culture is a part of the issue, but so is DPS’s response to complainants and the University’s handling of the entire thing. However, I don’t think that it’s accurate to say that Greek culture plays no part in USC’s rape culture. The Row is definitely a contributing force, and the sooner the University stops pushing it under the rug, the sooner we can start healing this wound that has been afflicted on the Trojan family.
I had not read Provost Garrett’s letter when I wrote the above. USC has mounted a considerable response to rape claims. What is needed are preventive measures which address the permissive attitude toward underage drinking and behavior incompatible with a top academic university. 
Last year when there was excessive drinking and rowdy behavior in front of Greek houses, the USC dean’s response to “take it inside” behind closed doors was a very problematic, enabling message, for example. The new dean and assistant dean will likely evolve a more appropriate, supportive and educational approach to encourage more adaptive interpersonal behavior both in public and behind closed doors.
I’m glad to finally see an article on this subject appear in the DT.   It seems this issue has been covered up long enough.  I hope any future investigations are fair to both parties.  
God Bless!
The University of Michigan, along with many other American universities, will roll out a new policy on the handling of sexual assault cases on campus. This will include mandatory training on the new policy for all students. UM still wants to cover up a rape case involving two of their star football players that they refused to investigate.
In 2009, Brendan Gibbons was a red shirt freshman field goal kicker for the University of Michigan football team. However, before his first varsity kick, he was arrested shortly after the Michigan/Ohio State football game in 2009, for raping an 18 yr. old freshman at a party in the Chi Psi fraternity house. The police refused to release his name or confirm his arrest so the local newspaper did not publish a story about his arrest. 
The victim immediately began receiving threats against her if she pressed charges, including a threat to rape her again if she pressed charges from All American football player, Taylor Lewan. She left school for 2 months and stopped receiving or returning the phone calls from police so the investigation was stopped. When she returned to school, she tried to file a complaint against Gibbons through the University’s more private student disciplinary process but many University officials told her that there was nothing they could do since she did not press criminal charges. 
The Huffington Post article referenced above presents significant concerns for USC to address (Radiostar would do well to read it). It is essential that effective leadership be shown by the new dean and assistant dean of students. The permissiveness and lack of oversight in the past has led to an on campus shooting and unchecked Greek and likely non Greek behavior that has substantially detracted from the atmosphere on campus and USC’s ascension as a top academic university. This is a well thought-out DT  article that provides the administration with excellent suggestions.
Rape culture doesn’t real.
If you’re raped then go to the police.  Why is it a University’s job to investigate a rape case.  If a student was murdered on campus, would we turn to the administration to get to the bottom of this?  Of course not, the police would be involved immediately.  The same should be true of any other serious felony.
Your definition of consent is silly too.  If nothing less than a verbal “yes” equals consent, then my boyfriend and I sexually assault each other every day.  All of my friends are serial sexual assaulters as well.

For many years, fingerprinting has been the method used to identify criminals based on past crimes and traces left at previous scenes. Everyone has their fingerprints taken at some point in their life and later stored in a database. This process has long since become outdated with criminals outsmarting the police by wearing gloves to cover their traces.
There is another method, one in which DNA is collected, that proves to be much more efficient. In this method, those that are arrested have their cheeks swabbed and matched with DNA left at other crime scenes that are stored in a database.
Wendy Fu | Daily Trojan
 
If there are any matches, then officers can press further charges. The problem this process faces is that 24 states in the U.S. have laws in place that prevent police from taking DNA samples from those arrested as they see it as a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Collecting DNA that could reveal too many details about a person is considered an “unreasonable search.” They require a conviction to begin collecting DNA, which seems like an incredible step backward in that the process of determining a suspect’s guilt could be done much more quickly if DNA were taken upon arrest.
The database that contains these DNA profiles is known as Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), and it stores the profiles of millions of criminals, as well as DNA records collected at crime scenes. CODIS could be incorrectly interpreted as a huge database that contains too many private details about the genetic and health information about all citizens.
This, however, is not what CODIS is. This program in fact does not contain any DNA profiles, but instead has only 13 genetic markers which have no relationships to any medical or physical traits. These markers are like fingerprints in that they reveal only the identity of a person. CODIS cannot even be hacked as there are no names attached to the set of the 13 DNA markers. Moreover, members of law enforcement themselves have to contact the department that found the profile in order to attach a name to the set of markers. This is just an extra level of security that ensures no one’s private DNA information is hacked.
Many criminals in the states that allow DNA collection have been sent to prison thanks to this process, especially in cases of sexual violence. Suspects that have been arrested and gone through this process have been matched with DNA left at scenes of rape, which has led to conviction of previous crimes that had gone unsolved. For example, a graduate student from New Mexico State University, Katie Sepich, was raped in 2003 and her body was burned and dumped nearby. The case had gone unsolved for years until in 2006, when the DNA found underneath her fingernails matched the DNA left at sites of more recent rapes, connecting the DNA to a killer that had gone free for several years.
DNA collection is the new form of fingerprinting, and in the 21st century, it is the most modern and convenient form of matching identities. Due to the ambiguity provided by only 13 genetic markers being collected which provide no information other than identity, there is nothing to be feared from the simple process of a cheek swab. The ban that certain states have placed on DNA collection only takes us steps backwards in catching and convicting criminals.

This article makes no comment about recent Supreme Court cases which question he constitutionality of DNA collection at the time of arrest. Additionally, if a minority of the states allow this sort of DNA collection, I don’t think anyone would characterize it as a “ban.”

We all know it: our school has a reputation for being “The University of Spoiled Children.” A stroll through the Ronald Tutor Campus Center will make it apparent that this stereotype is often very true — it’s full of students hurrying around, clad in designer products. The university administration is certainly aware of this stereotype, constantly striving to rid our school of this unfortunate tag.
These efforts appear to be working, too — at least in some statistics and in the university’s rhetoric. The diversification of USC from a school of students from predominantly rich and white backgrounds into the socioeconomic and racial mix it is today show how the university’s administration is actively working to make USC a more colorful institution. In fact, the freshman classes of 2011 and 2012 were touted as the most ethnically diverse in the university’s history. To compound that, USC proudly declares on its financial aid website that it offers nearly 270 million dollars of need-based financial aid and that the university has more than 4,100 low-income undergraduate students.
Yet something isn’t right. Despite the university’s efforts to diversify the school economically, the atmosphere of USC’s campus retains a distinctly well-moneyed atmosphere, if not for the stream of German luxury sedans cruising in and out of Parking Structure X.
A 2007 study by UCLA’s Graduate School of Education and Information Studies entitled, “American Freshmen: Forty-Year Trends 1966–2006,“ reveals that this affluent atmosphere is not just limited to USC, but is rather becoming commonplace among higher education institutions, both public and private, in the United States. According to the study, the median family income for freshmen enrolling in a four-year institution is about $74,000 per year. By contrast, the median family income in the United States, at the time of the study, was about $46,000 per year. Based on the UCLA study, it’s simple to understand that higher education in general — not just at elite private institutions like USC — is growing more inaccessible to the shrinking American middle class, a group of people who are not affluent enough to pay for higher education outright, but do not meet the established income guidelines for providing need-based aid.
This catch-22 plays out all over the country, bolting the door of opportunity closed for middle-class families. Indeed, it even happens here at our own institution, which claims to fulfill need-based aid.
Briana Tobin is a 19-year-old girl who, until just recently, was an undergraduate student here at USC. Tobin came to USC from Joliet, Ill., a largely middle-class suburb of Chicago. Despite having a successful first year at USC, Bri will not be returning to USC this fall because USC Financial Aid was unable to give her family an adequate package to ensure her attendance.
The particulars behind Tobin’s case are simple: Tobin’s older sister graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics last spring and chose to continue her education and pursue a degree in law. Because of the methods behind the way USC calculates need-based aid (independent of the FAFSA), however, law school costs and outstanding loan payments from undergraduate costs of a sibling are not factored in when considering what a family can contribute for a student’s education. This difference allowed USC Financial Aid to calculate the Estimated Family Contribution as being much more than Bri’s family could realistically afford, especially in light of her sister’s undergraduate loans.
For families like Tobin’s, the escalating cost of college is simply becoming too much (case in point: According to the Los Angeles times, USC’s cost to attend was about $30,000 in 2000 compared to roughly $60,000 today). Seeing as Tobin does not want to mortgage the next 40 years of her life to third party loan companies, she has opted to not return to USC, and instead transfer to a different institution that has offered her family a better aid package.
Considering that USC is in the middle of a multibillion-dollar fundraising campaign, perhaps more money from donations can be set aside to help ease the enormous cost of higher education. Though donations are often given with certain strings attached that dictate how donors’ funds are utilized, perhaps it would be in everybody’s best interest if the university gave the same amount of attention that it gives toward seeking donations for new buildings and fancy campus plaza clocks instead toward seeking more purely philanthropic donations expressly for the purpose of helping students like Tobin afford a school like USC.
But perhaps the image benefit that comes with a giant cardinal and gold clock in the center of campus is a better use of money than helping a student get a first-rate education on that same campus.

USC should also take a look at its merit aid policies.  Too many students like me, who for whatever reason did not receive large merit-based scholarships upon acceptance, have to watch our peers who did receive them struggle to maintain the GPAs to keep them while we far exceed their academic achievements.
How about we start rewarding achievements made here in college in the same way we reward achievements made in high school?  Although some departments offer merit scholarships on a yearly basis, these awards don’t compare in magnitude to the awards given to incoming freshmen upon acceptance.
Changing this could help keep high-achieving students like Briana–and like me–enrolled here.  Doesn’t USC want to keep its best students, or does it only care about attracting freshmen with high stats to improve its admissions rankings?
What a ridiculous way to end this piece. The insinuation of your last sentence is offensive and laughable.
Everyone is looking for handouts. Perhaps a $60K+ per year education is not a right, and thus less expensive options may better serve the needs of those with differing financial backgrounds. 
Enough of this “my middle class family ONLY makes $75K per year, I expect USC/government to fund the majority of my college education because I don’t want to sacrifice the luxuries I have come to enjoy in my comfortable middle class life”.
I am middle class, yes. 
This is my favorite comment: “I don’t want to sacrifice the luxuries I have come to enjoy in my comfortable middle class life”.
Well. Apparently middle class in LA is a little different than where I’m from. Middle class where I’m from is 40-45k. Yes, that is comfortable. Is is luxurious? Not really, and I wouldn’t ask for any other luxuries. I live alternately with my father in a suburban house, and my stepfather and toddler sister in a townhouse. I am grateful for what I have. 
Where in the article, precisely, did I say that I wanted a handout? Where did I complain about USC’s financial aid? Where did I say I “expect USC/government to fund the majority of my college education because I don’t want to sacrifice the luxuries I have come to enjoy in my comfortable middle class life?”
I was simply asked about my situation. The author here wrote an Opinion article about USC’s financial aid system. It’s an OPINION. I was used as a reference, a jumping off point, an example, etc. 
At the end of the day, I am quite happy where I am. And I am not asking you to apologize for “partying.” By all means, keep on partying. I am just an example of what is happening to a lot of USC students (and students from other private universities). 
Again, please do not get so defensive. I am simply a student who decided that “less expensive options may better serve the needs of [myself] with [a] differing financial background.” So be it. Evidently I belong somewhere else.
Jessica – how about you donate and specify you want your money to go towards scholarships??   My guess is you were too busy complaining to put together this kind of rational thought, no?
Jim, even scholarships may not necessarily help out those that need help. USC’s financial aid removes the equivalent amount of a scholarship from grants if there are grants.
USC does indeed need to shift some focus to financial aid. Students who are “scholarly” might have to leave school because they cannot afford it, including those mentioned in the article.
Insinuated in your comment Stanley is that USC doesn’t focus on financial aid. You are incorrect if that’s what you mean to say. 1 billion of the campaign is targeted towards aid; further the University already has one of the largest if not the the largest pool of university-sponsored aid. No system is perfect of course and not everyone can be accommodated, but the sweeping generalization suggested in your comment and Mr. Tinoco’s poorly reasoned article need a rethink.
Lastly, of course scholarships reduce the balance of other aid! This is so other students can be accommodated.
Great story. Applies not only to usc but to universities across the nation. This is why I don’t donate money to my alma mater, I don’t want it going towards a new building or overpaid staff and faculty–I want it going towards students who can’t have daddy write a 20k check for tuition every semester.
I sympathize with the author’s story, having attended the university on financial aid as well. And further agree with the need to make higher education more affordable.
But there’s something missing here: the university has listed a campaign goal of $1 billion for strident scholarships, which is the same as the capital projects goal. The other 4 billion includes funding for research and other academic programs which are equally vital the university’s seeming constant ascent. 
The example of the new clock, donated by a supporter as a token of appreciation hardly diminishes USC’s emphasis on financial aid as a priority. One other note not mentioned by the author is that USC appears to have among the highest if not the highest university-sponsores financial aid programs. 
It’s fine to advocate for a friends unfortunate situation, but to magnify it as a macro trend without more thoughtful analysis, is a disservice to your readers and the university.

After his trip to Brazil, Pope Francis had a candid moment to reporters in which he said, regarding gay priests, “Who am I to judge?” Many are hailing this comment as a new day for the Roman Catholic Church, but the church has not demonstrated a serious change in their position on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender matters.
The pope’s comments are a good first step, but the pope and the Catholic Church still need to do more to accept everyone.
While the pope may have made his personal views clear on the matter, he will still need to enact reform in the church before gay clergy can feel accepted or safe. As the Associated Press pointed out, Pope Benedict XVI signed a document in 2005 stating that homosexual men have no place within the church. This wasn’t much of a surprise, because Benedict was a particularly conservative pope, even by the standards of the conservative Catholic Church. The remarks Pope Francis made while flying from Brazil are important, but they do not indicate doctrinal change, and do not go far enough in recognizing the need for gay priests to feel accepted in the clergy.
In the eyes of the church, there is still a stigma attached to homosexuality. Pope Benedict XVI said that ridding the church of gay priests would solve the child molestation problems, even though groups such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and the American Psychological Association have repeatedly debunked the myth of a link between homosexuality and a desire to molest kids. That evidence, however, has not been acknowledged by the church, and those claims simultaneously deny an underlying psychological problem in sexual abusers; thus, wrongly indicting homosexual clergymen.
The Vatican later clarified the pope’s statements by saying that homosexual orientation was fine, but acting on an attraction to a person of the same sex was still a sin. So, theologically speaking, it makes complete sense for the pope to have no qualm with gay priests, because they must remain celibate. Both gay and straight priests who have sex are sinners. For Catholics who are not ordained, however, gay sex is still a sin. Effectively, the Pope hasn’t made any changes to Catholic doctrine by saying he will not judge gay priests, because the Bible does not condemn a person for having homosexual thoughts, only for acting on those thoughts.
The APA tells us that a person’s sexual orientation is randomly and genetically determined, just like gender. Gay priests have no more control over their earthly desires than anyone else. If the pope is willing to acknowledge that gay priests are valuable to the Church as long as they do not sin, then the same thought should extend to female priests. The fact that Pope Francis is unwilling to change the church’s stance on women demonstrates that he is not ready for change, and casts a pall over his statements about gay priests. The church has no legitimate reason to discriminate against any person for characteristics beyond their control, regardless of sexual orientation or gender.
In the Vatican’s clarifying statement, the church made it clear that gay sex is still a sin. There is no change from the text of Leviticus. For gay Catholics, this means that men and women who have sex with partners of the same gender are still committing a sin. Effectively, this means gay Catholics must remain celibate to be accepted by the Church. This is rather cruel of the church, to deny the physical representations of love for one part of the population. The church claims that “God is Love,” and often regards the act of lovemaking as one of the most sacred bonds between a man and a woman, so to deny that sacred bond for two men or two women is merciless. Effectively, this catches gay Catholics between the church and their partners, and forces them to choose one over the other.

Word to the wise (and this goes for pretty much every journalist out there nowadays): if you are going to write an opinion piece about the teachings of the Catholic Church, please PLEASE read (and understand) some official Church documents on whatever particular topic you’re writing about. The Church has rational, intelligent, and beautiful reasons for holding that marriage can only ever be between a man and a woman or that women cannot be priests. Unfortunately not many people, Catholic or not, will ever understand these positions fully because they do not read the actual Church documents or philosophical-theological works explaining the positions. Instead, they rely on single sentence summaries of Church teaching which can’t capture the reasoning or the fullness of the truth behind the position. Archbishop Fulton Sheen said, “There are not more than 100 people in the world who truly hate the Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they perceive to be the Catholic Church.”

This all goes against the teaching of our Church haven’t enough little boys been Molested by allowing Homosexual men in to the Priesthood?..I agree with Pope Benedict the XVI No Homosexual Priests ever !!!..We need to protect children!!!..Why isn’t the Baptist ,.Methodist ,Lutherans EXT.EXT.EXT. asked these questions as this is rampant in the Methodist church and Jewish Synagogues,Baptist youth groups and Lutherans as well ,Boy scouts loaded with it and these people with this problem and it is a huge problem go were they can molest Children ..What a better place then to become a Priest,Minister or Rabbi..Or Boy Scout leader but the media never mentions this blatant out rage within other places only the Catholic Church ..My Allegiance is with Pope Benedict the XVI,I love him and Pray for him he was just what our Church needed weeding out!!!..Pope Francis i will pray for his soul!!!
Seems   Bias to say the least  The Papal
I agree with chico889. 100%
I am a Trojan Masters student and a Catholic, and I find this piece to be a smear against the Church.
http://www.ncregister.com/blog/10-quotes-that-prove-the-pope-is-a-liberal/
Make sure to read the last paragraph. 
Spoiler alert:  The quotes were from the particularly conservative Pope. The Church is not liberal or conservative; it’s Catholic.
I trust that when the author eventually graduates, he will stick to international relations (global business) and stay out of journalism, especially religious journalim. Practically every sentence of his opinion piece manifests a naive, confused, if not a malevolent interpretation of the church’s official position. For example, the official teaching has always been that gays should be fully accepted as anyone else;  and that we are not to judge one another’s culpability in any matters, sexual or otherwise. Neither has there ever been any confusion between pedophilia and homosexuality, even though a high proportion of the clerical molestation cases have involved boys in their mid- to late teens (even early twenties). 
Many Catholics (myself included) are strongly urging the church’s authorities to totally rethink their official teachings and practices around the so-called “pelvic issues” (divorce, contraception, gay relationships, celibacy, etc). Naive half-truths of the state of play in the church, such as this opinion piece, are not particularly helpful to our cause.

During a visit to Islamabad on Aug. 1, Secretary of State John Kerry said that the overthrowing of Egypt’s first democratically elected president Mohammed Morsi had been aimed at “restoring democracy.”
But Kerry’s definition of democracy is about as democratic as the restoration of democracy in Nicaragua at gunpoint under former President Ronald Reagan. Contrary to the beliefs of Sec. Kerry and President Barack Obama’s administration, the ousting of President Morsi is the farthest thing from democratic, and will have lasting negative effects on the region.
When Morsi was originally elected as president, Foreign Policy wrote that the international community believed that President Morsi’s political party, the Muslim Brotherhood, would use their power in the Egyptian executive and legislative branches to push through a series of fundamentally Islamist reforms that would curtail individual liberties in Egypt. Instead, President Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood proved to be somewhat unprepared to rule, but they never used the military to exert control over the people, as Hosni Mubarak did for decades prior to the Egyptian revolution. Simply being an ineffective leader, as Morsi was, is not a legitimate reason to stage a coup. A lack of efficacy should have resulted in Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood being ousted at election time, not at gunpoint. Had Morsi abused the power of the executive branch to nullify the powers of the legislature or judiciary, or ordered the military to fire upon civilians, then a coup would be justified and necessary.
This coup will unfortunately have negative implications for Egypt, even as they are still attempting to recover from their bloody revolution in 2011. The Muslim Brotherhood, which survived generations in exile under Mubarak, now realizes that “democracy” won’t work for their aims in Egypt. Instead, military force seems to be the new black. The promise of democracy is now moot; the military has shown that a militaristic state is the future of Egypt. From the perspective of the Brotherhood, there is no point to working within the system if electoral gains will be nullified with military force. In the future, expect less political activism and more violent action in Egypt.
The power of the military will also be felt beyond the borders of Egypt. Kerry made his statements from Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, a nation that has experienced a handful of military takeovers since gaining their independence 60 years ago. The most powerful nation on the planet endorsing force over voting rights in one of the historically least democratic nations sends a clear and influential message.
True, some revolutions have led to positive democratic change. The state that emerged from the American Revolution is currently the most powerful in the world. Then again, some revolutions have done more harm to democratic ideals than good, notably the Iranian Revolution, the French Revolution and the Bolshevik Revolution, even though these revolutions were originally meant to be by the people and for the people. The problem with revolutions or coups is that they throw a country into a state of anarchy, and the priority of the new rulers of the state is to put the stability of the state first and ideals second. Niccolo Machiavelli makes a case for prioritizing the state before ideals in The Prince, and that book has been a foundational text for statecraft in the 500 years since its publication. As Ian Bremmer writes in his book The J Curve, the quickest way to restore stability after a state slides into anarchy is to create autarchy, although in the long run a democracy will eventually be the most stable form of government. As evidenced by the French and the Bolsheviks, however, even the loftiest of ideals of liberte, egalite e fraternite can give way to chaos.
Sec. Kerry did try to quantify his statements in Islamabad by saying that millions of people wanted a change in leadership in Egypt. Kerry was trying to justify the change in leadership in Egypt because of public outcry. At face value, that seems democratic, popular support from an unjustified mass of people without an election is not democratic. By the same logic, since millions of people also support the Taliban because they provide jobs for rural Afghans and Pakistanis and they don’t have a habit of blowing up village homes with Predator drones and Hellfire missiles, Kerry could make the case that the Taliban should be in charge in southwest Asia. It’s doubtful, however, that the U.S. will ask the Taliban to take over in Kabul anytime soon. There are some Afghan and Pakistani political leaders who have ties to or sympathize with the Taliban, but they have been legitimately and constitutionally appointed or elected and do not make up a majority of the government in either Afghanistan or Pakistan.
Large numbers of Egyptians wanted Morsi out of power, but they should have waited for the next election cycle in order to set the precedent for a stable democratic process. Keep in mind that former President George W. Bush won in 2000 with fewer votes than then-Vice President Al Gore, yet still got his time in office.
For supporters of  Morsi, this ouster cheapens their voice. In removing Morsi from power, the military has sent a message that the voice of the people does not matter if the other side screams loud enough. That’s not the point of a democracy. Democracies only retain legitimacy if the people participate, and fewer Egyptians are likely to participate if they feel their voice can be silenced by the military.
In Egypt, we saw a state emerge from anarchy with the goal of moving toward democracy under Morsi, only to be plunged back into anarchy with the ouster. Not only is the state now more unstable than it was under the ineffective Morsi government, but there is also an increased chance that Egypt could move toward a military dictatorship to restore stability. Egypt is decidedly less well-off at this stage of the game.
The Arab Spring uprisings were supposed to be about the people of the Middle East throwing off the chains of autocratic repression and welcoming democracy. Instead, this return to military rule in Egypt marks an end to democratic hopes in the already volatile region.

Outstanding read, I simply passed this specific onto a colleague who had been doing a little research on that. And he actually bought me personally lunch because I found it regarding him grin So let me rephrase that.
I may not agree with everything in this article, but it is a very well-written piece that will give me cause to consider over the coming days.  Kudos!

With the incoming class of 2017, on-campus political advocacy can be more effective than ever before, bringing new enthusiasm and vigor to student movements, which saw effective gains in the last semester.
The USC student population is already actively engaged by ongoing events, both local and national. A rather popular protest emerged in early May as a response to alleged racial profiling on behalf of the Los Angeles Police Department in disbanding a party attended by many black students and the ensuing arrests. On May 7, gatherings of concerned and affected students resulted in a packed meeting of over 750 students with LAPD officials in the Tutor Campus Center.
This is the sort of involvement that provides USC with a dynamic environment. Among other things, it encourages a consistent dialogue between the students and staff. In the past year or so, voter registration efforts on campus were moderately successful in bringing new voters into the fold, but different strategies will be needed in a year without a major national election. Moving into this next school year, it is up to the newest members of the Trojan Family to add the energy and vitality to student activism that is so critical.
Student voices from all sides are important for political activism in a university sandwiched in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the United States, let alone the world. Without the presence of our student leaders, the interchange of new ideas and modes of thinking that characterizes a major university would be absent.
In this vibrant university atmosphere, nearly a dozen political organizations, for nearly every cause under the sun, regularly call for greater changes in student life. Perhaps these organizations offer something to new students one thing that USChange and others could not: an organized, strategic conduit for reform.
In this way, students will be more than able to advocate making their experience at USC the best it can possibly be. Organizations such as the Political Student Assembly keep daily issues at the forefront by focusing them into debates; in fact, they will host a debate in the first week of September about USC’s security policies, something which surely affects every student every day. This debate is just a small example of a multitude of events hosted specifically with student expression in mind.
This also begs the question as to how these organizations and a new freshman class will react to a federal investigation of USC’s sexual harassment policies. Even though the news first broke in July, and university staff responded to it appropriately, the actual investigation could very well end during the school year. The attention and change that a seven-member group from the Student Coalition Against Rape (SCAR) discovered during the summer would reach critical mass, as its message resonates with new students shocked to hear such allegations.
While this is speculative, the importance of every new freshman class to political causes on campus is not. These clubs look every year for new people to get involved, in order to gain a new influx of creativity, energy, ideas and passion. With so many choices available, the Class of 2017 is vested with the ability to shape the future of our university, not just for themselves, but for future generations of students. Who knows? Any number of future political leaders could get their start in student political advocacy.
Despite USC’s reputation as a conservative campus, student protests have been strong since the 1960s, and many varying in scope: a 2011 protest against sexual violence resulted in a university-wide overhaul of its safety regulations. Though not as wide in scope, protests in front of Tommy Trojan last year about civilian deaths in Israel and Palestine left students to decide for themselves who was in the right. The proof of the necessity of political activism to these new students lies in the diversity of causes that drive USC’s students: If there’s something we care deeply about that affects other people, chances are we can find others who think in the same way.
What many of these political organizations at USC need is a new breed of dedicated, concerned students who will actively engage themselves as citizens. Only then can the incoming group of freshmen continue the widespread student involvement we witnessed at the end of the last school year, and adapt to new causes that might arise. One can only hope that they will act to institute change at USC with the same fervor and aplomb that we see at the Coliseum.

There has been a recent wave of criticism over song lyrics some have called “rapey.” The controversy began with Maybach Music mogul Rick Ross’s lyrics in the song “U.O.E.N.O.” with Atlanta-based artist Rocko. The specific lines in question were, “Put Molly in her champagne, she ain’t even know it / I took her home and enjoyed that / she ain’t even know it.” Many feminists, critics and fans alike were infuriated by these lines. A media firestorm ensued, sparking a lot of backlash against Rozay — so much so that Reebok withdrew its endorsement deal with him.
Recently, the discourse continued with R&B crooner Robin Thicke’s immensely popular “Blurred Lines.” The song features lyrics telling a woman she is “the hottest b-tch in this place” and a constant entreating of, “I know you want it.” The lyrics appear rather tame, until juxtaposed with the unrated video for the song, which depicts Thicke, Pharell and T.I. following topless vixens in thongs, chasing them with giant syringe needles and a set of balloons that spell out the phrase, “Robin Thicke has a big d-ck.”
In both instances, each artist deserved his fair share of criticism for the blatant misogyny they displayed in their music. The gray area, however, is why the intensity of media’s charges of misogyny changes from one artist to the other. Though Reebok dropped its endorsements deal with Ross, the creators of “Blurred Lines” didn’t receive the same punishment from CoverGirl, and the song is as popular as ever. Maybe Thicke and his “Blurred Lines” are more likeable than Ross and his “U.O.E.N.O.” creation, so his sexually violent undertones are easier to dismiss. Some would argue it’s because Thicke is an R&B singer versus Ross who is a rapper. Others might say that Thicke’s lyrics are not as bad as Ross’, making the case that slipping women MDMA is far more improper than barraging them with alcohol. There might even be a racial component lodged in there somewhere. So it’s easy to see that the lines are indeed blurry.
The looming problem these songs highlight is explaining why voices are louder during some instances and not others. No one came for blood when 2 Chainz said, “I take ya girl and kidnap her / Feed her to my mattress.” No one felt compelled to police music when Miguel wastes no time asking a girl at the club “How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?” No one grabs their pitchforks or lights their torches when it comes to the material of artists such as Odd Future’s Tyler the Creator, whose lyrics are too vulgar to mention.
There aren’t any simple answers when questioning how one both engages in and fights against misogyny. Yet one still needs to be astute enough to interrogate one’s own sense, sensibilities and critiques toward mainstream culture from time to time. Rape-allusive lyrics should be considered wrong no matter who says them. If not, then one should stop saying that “nothing in art is off limits” if they know in their hearts that the artist, the audience and the medium matters. If not, one needs to stop propagating the idea that it’s OK to get women drunk at clubs, bars and college campuses across the country in order to have sex with them. And if one cannot do these things, it would be beneficial for them to at least attempt to gain an understanding as to why we cannot.
This is a call for people to hold critics as accountable as the artists they critique — to insist they prove that their responses to questionable lyrics are organic and not the chime-ins of a fickle Twittersphere, or worse, a product of selectivity instead of rationality.

Not to worry, the rest of the album sucks.
It’s got a hypnotic base line, straight out of Marvin Gaye’s “Gotta Give it Up”.  There’s no doubt about it.  It’s that addictive base line and rhythm that I think is the basis for the amazing success of “Blurred Lines”.  But the lyrics, whether you consider this rap or r&b are repulsive.  I mean, “something big to tear your a– apart”.  References to women as “bitches” in such a casual way seems to acknowledge that this is an acceptable way to think of women.  I wish Thicke would have done something else with what he stole from Marvin Gaye.  Still, can’t get that opening out of my head.
Okay, the balloon phrase is funny. I don’t see the “rapey-ness” in that..
There is OBVIOUSLY something wrong with slipping Molly into a girls drink without her knowledge…. I’m PRETTY SURE that is followed by a felony… But offering a girl alcohol in order to get her drunk to have sex with her? Isn’t that almost EVERY guys reasoning for trying to get a girl drunk or constantly buying her drinks? 
To me, the lines aren’t that blurry..
I’d like to see Blurred Lines banned from being played on the radio. Or any song that has “rapey” inducing lyrics that disrespects women and treats them as objects for a man’s pleasure.

John Lennon, Jim Morrison, Amy Winehouse, Barack Obama, Whitney Houston … and the Boston bomber? All of these people have landed the cover of Rolling Stone in their lifetimes as high-profile cultural figures. The legendary music magazine departed from their tradition of featuring generally well-respected, legitimate contributors to society when they made the controversial decision to put Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover of their August issue. The public’s backlash, though understandable, is misplaced.
The pain and bloodshed carried out by Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan were motivated by evil intent, and to glorify the brothers is to glorify terrorists. What the article and its cover accomplished, however, was not to glorify them or elevate them as heroes. The article instead communicated the frightening pull of religious fundamentalism and political radicalism to normal kids such as Tsarnaev, a pull that should be understood if we are to understand the increasingly unpredictable nature of domestic terrorism.
When the cover featuring Tsarnaev came out, the public reacted angrily. How could a respected American magazine portray such a monster as a rock star? But such initial reactions did not recognize the story’s content and intent.
Victims of the bombings reacted with enraged statements, while retailers such as CVS and Walgreens pulled the issue from their shelves, according to the New Republic.
Boston Mayor Tom Menino wrote a letter to Rolling Stone in response to the cover, calling it “a disgrace” and decrying its decision to feature the bomber rather than the attack’s survivors: “The survivors of the Boston attacks deserve Rolling Stone cover stories, though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them.”
Of course, the misunderstanding and anger are entirely understandable. Tsarnaev and his brother murdered and maimed innocent people, which altered numerous lives and ended many others. The Tsarnaev brothers will never and should never be forgiven for their evil acts against our country.
That being said, journalist Janet Reitman wrote an extensively researched piece providing a look into the baffling persona of Dzhokhar, who by all appearances was just a normal American college kid who just happened to have Chechen roots. Reitman’s article is not an attempt to elicit a sympathetic response to Dzhokhar from the public, though she does describe a less than ideal family life and his disillusioned adolescent searching for identity.
At the beginning of the article, she states that Tsarnaev’s youth and background as an integrated member of American society necessitates an understanding of how he became a terrorist so willing to destroy the lives of innocent people: “The fact that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is young … makes it all the more important for us to examine the complexities of this issue and gain a more complete understanding of how a tragedy like this happens.”
Matt Taibbi, a writer for the Rolling Stone and a Boston native, defended the article soon after it broke as a necessary and commendable example of responsible journalism and as a thoughtful look at the making of a homegrown terrorist.
The very innocence of the image itself, said Taibbi, speaks volumes about the completely unpredictable nature of Tsarnaev’s turn towards terrorism: “It’s Tsarnaev’s very normalcy and niceness that is the most monstrous and terrifying thing about him. The story Janet wrote about the modern terrorist is that you can’t see him coming. He’s not walking down the street with a scary beard and a red X through his face. He looks just like any other kid.”
The article’s aim was not to humanize Tsarnaev for the sake of humanizing him, but to highlight the shadowy world of radicalism and the volatility of those that harbor radical tendencies. It acknowledges that not all terrorists are bearded men hiding out in Afghanistan’s mountainous caves with Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders, but that terrorists might also walk among us.
Whatever the reaction to the cover story and its image, the joke is ultimately on Tsarnaev. He is in federal custody facing the death penalty, or, if he’s lucky, life in a federal prison. We don’t have anything to lose from trying to understand Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his cruel motivations. but we do have a lot to gain from doing so. A better understanding of what happened can help us avoid such tragedies in the future, tragedies that would cause infinitely more pain than a poorly placed image on a magazine cover.

Amid high anticipation and attention from both Britain and the international community, Britain’s Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge on July 22.

Despite the celebrations Prince George’s birth brought to the international community, disaster was unraveling miles away in China. On the morning of July 22, series of powerful earthquakes struck the northwestern province of Gansu, killing  more than 90, injuring at least 1000, and displacing as many as 227,000 people from their homes, according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
Homes of the Gansu province, most of which are rather underdeveloped and made of timber and mud brick, could not withstand the quake, followed by as many as 371 aftershocks in the area.
These two events, occurring simultaneously, highlight yet another failure by the media to address an international natural disaster in favor of the anticipation of Britain’s beloved royal baby.
The hype over the arrival of Prince George started weeks before his birth, culminating in a frenzy as the Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to the hospital after entering the early stages of labor. Both British and international media jumped on board to cover the news, flocking outside the hospital and keeping live coverage of the news.
Though the birth of any individual is an exciting one, many questioned if hyped-up media coverage of Prince George was truly necessary.
“Well, you know, everybody has babies,” said Margaret Rhodes, Queen Elizabeth II’s first cousin, when asked by CNN if she was excited about the birth of a royal baby. “And it’s lovely, but I don’t get wildly excited about it.”
The British are also split on opinions of the media sensation the birth of a royal baby brought. Press TV reported how BornEqual.org, a website and Twitter campaign, criticized the royal baby media hype and encouraged society to reconsider the appropriateness of royal birthright.
In the past, the media has exercised similar irresponsibility in news coverage. On Aug. 5, 2012, Wade Michael Page entered a Sikh temple in Wisconsin and murdered six innocent devotees. Many individuals noticed this event did not receive nearly as much attention as the Colorado theater shooting. In fact, the front page of Yahoo! News was inundated by trivial stories about celebrities rather than coverage of the terrible massacre.
In the case of the royal baby, there is no wrong in celebrating the birth of a new life, as the media did so loyally for the wee Prince George. But it may not be worth the hype when it sways the attention from people in suffering and need of aid — even if they are miles away and may not directly impact our daily lives.

At an unscheduled press conference on July 19, six days after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of Trayvon Martin, President Barack Obama gave his first extensive remarks on a case that has divided the nation. Instead of celebration, Obama’s personal speech has garnered a surprising amount of backlash from critics. Yet Obama’s deeply emotional and frank remarks on the prevalent issue of racism should be lauded for sparking an honest, nationwide dialogue in search of some much needed progress.
Danny Razzano | Daily Trojan
“You know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago,” Obama said.
Despite the profound connection that Obama established in this one comment, critics of his response abound. One Business Insider online commenter said that Obama “continuing to evoke the ‘if I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon’ [line] is despicable race-baiting,” adding that “Obama thinks it is smart to inject racism and race-favoritism into the political debate.” On the other end of the spectrum, critics like talk show host Tavis Smiley have categorized Obama’s “weak as pre-sweetened Kool-Aid” response as an example of “lead[ing] from behind” on the issue of race relations.
Yet, the honesty that rang through his deeply personal reflection of the case is unmistakable. Instead of mincing words, the president brought up race as a critical player in the tragedy and Zimmerman’s ultimate acquittal in a rational and thought-out manner.
Rather than approaching the acquittal of Zimmerman with blame and anger, Obama respected how the trial was handled and its outcome, stating that “once the jury has spoken, that’s how our system works.” And yet, he did not stop there. He moved on to logically expand upon how he saw the case without escalating tension, just “talk[ing] a little bit about context and how people have responded to it and how people are feeling.” He eased his way into expressing his thoughts and ultimately emerged with a call to solve together a problem bigger than just one man and one murder case.
By empathizing with the pain of Americans, Obama embraced his historic standing as the nation’s first black president.
At one point, Obama clearly explained why the black community has responded to the verdict in the way it has: not because they are naive in understanding “the challenges that exist for African American boys,” but because they feel that its context, the historical background needed to understand the injustice in this case, is being denied.
Obama is not heightening racial divisions with seemingly biased statements either. Rep. Karen Bass (D-Los Angeles) put that criticism to rest when she said, “President Obama made a statement in a way that only he could as the nation’s first African American president, symbolizing both how far our country has come and that there is still much more work to be done.”
Presidents of the United States have lost themselves many a time in the tricky world of partisan politics. But in this instance, Obama became a unifier, not a divider. Instead of dodging questions and wanting to stay on the safer side of the political realm, Obama decided to speak up for the good of the country.
“Ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?” Obama said. “Am I judging people as much as I can, based on not the color of their skin, but the content of their character? That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy.”
America can do better than racial rancor. The soul-searching that Obama called for in his speech applies to us all, regardless of skin color. While his speech was not intended to solve the entirety of the race problem in this country, it should open the door to ongoing dialogue nationwide that addresses the reality of racism and prejudice in existence today as well as determining what the residents of this country can do collectively to move forward. Americans, together, should act as unifiers — not detractors — of today’s nation and its judicial system.

There are hundreds of examples of violence and lawlessness in more than 80 cities around the country. There’s this book I have read, just google “White Girl Bleed a Lot”. It’s an epidemic of black mob violence. Racism is everywhere and we cannot deny that.
Yo Obama. Which one of the three  pukes that killed Chris Lane looks like your son?
All of them.
The problem with Obama’s statement, and missed by the article, is that it presumes race was an issue in the Trayvon Martin situation.  It wasn’t.  No one immediately connected to the tragedy said it was.  It is outsiders, such as Obama, unnecessarily interjecting race based on their own personal beliefs.
You’re right that Obama’s speech was highly personal and very responsible. But he did NOT bring “up race as a critical player in the tragedy and Zimmerman’s ultimate acquittal”.
In fact, in accepting the jury’s verdict, he implicitly accepted what both sides of the trial recognized: that race played no part. 
What Obama DID say was that black Americans see this incident through a prism colored by the past and by their personal experiences – in other words, with a unique bias.
And he also noted that “statistically somebody like Trayvon Martin was probably more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else” – in other words, by another black, as most black murder is black-on-black.
Obama wisely tried to divert the conversation from grand national gestures, which so many civil rights leaders are calling for, and resorting instead to personal soul-searching of the bias in EACH of us – black and white. And, perhaps most importantly, the need to focus on reducing “a lot of negative reinforcement” that black youths are subject to – implying the Hip-Hop culture, broken families, 73% out-of-wedlock births, and street crime as a way of life.
Obama did what only a black president could have done: acknowledge the reality of racism and prejudice in our nation AND refocus the conversation on the real issues that lie within the black community itself.
“could have been me”  Yeah, in those mean streets between the library and student center at Columbia University and Harvard Law School.  Way to feign sympathy.  However, if Jesse Jackson had a son, he’s look like Jesse Jackson Jr.

Despite changing numerous aspects of the iOS user interface, Apple fails to deliver the appropriate changes needed for a more refreshing and functional iPhone experience.
Just because it is an opinion piece, doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be substantiated with credible evidence or examples. How is this worthy of publication?
Poisoned Apple huh? What is this? If iOS 7 is not refreshing or functional, I’m not sure what is. Have you even used it or tested iOS 7 ready apps from developers?

USC starts the year in a state of flux.
The university has changed its personality over the years. With each decade, and each new leader, USC’s image has changed. Ask three different people to tell you about USC, and they’ll describe three different schools.
Depending on who you ask, USC is a school under investigation for its response to allegations of sexual assault, a school that struggles in its relationship with the community, a school on the way to becoming the academic powerhouse of the West Coast.
Our school is changing, changing at a such a rapid pace that a graduate from 2013 might not recognize USC in a few years. In the last year alone, USC has seen some monumental changes.
The university introduced the creation of the multidisciplinary USC Jimmy Iovine and Andre Young Academy for Arts, Technology and the Business of Innovation in the spring. USC also debuted its Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy in the fall. And the addition of several new hires in the upper echelon of the university also brings the potential for the university to change how it engages with students and defines itself.
But not all of the changes USC has experienced in the past year have stemmed from the university — the administration has also had to craft its response to several hot-button issues.
When President C. L. Max Nikias announced USC’s closed-campus security policy last November, the culture of the university shifted. When more than 70 Los Angeles Police Department officers swarmed a student party last May, the university’s relationship with the community shifted. When the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights in June launched an investigation into the alleged sexual assaults of three USC students, the perception of the university shifted yet again.
We’re at a crossroads; USC must seize this opportunity to select its own personality instead of being defined by controversy. This is a time of change, and amid this change, our school has some choices to make.
The way the university handles the big-picture issues now will determine others’ perception of USC for years to come.
We have an opportunity to determine USC’s future, but only by taking decisive action.

But as Newton’s law of gravity asserts, what goes up must come down. And like many child stars, Amanda Bynes’ stardom has definitely come tumbling down. This should inspire a frank discussion about mental illness rather than the humorous commentary that we’ve seen.
Today, this Nickelodeon star is nearly unrecognizable when compared to the sweet-faced girl that she once was: Her ever-changing, ill-fitting wigs, mismatching outfits and inappropriate outbursts have caused quite the stir.
Initially, she began tweeting nearly-naked self-portraits with bizarre captions and then took it as far as calling fellow celebrities such as Drake, Miley Cyrus and Rihanna “ugly.” Her record with the law enforcement isn’t too great either: Police have arrested Bynes for charges ranging from marijuana possession to a DUI. This is all in stark contrast to the gorgeous teenager who once graced the covers of Seventeen magazine and Vanity Fair, lauded for her down-to-earth personality.
Though other stars, such as Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears, have faced similar charges and public breakdowns, Bynes is different from the others — she has a mental illness. For this reason, we must sympathize instead of criticize.
Most recently, after allegedly setting fire to a neighbor’s driveway, she was admitted into a psychiatric ward on an involuntary hold. The Daily Mail reports that Bynes is currently being treated for schizophrenia. But no matter what disorder plagues her, society must acknowledge that Amanda Bynes has an illness. And mental illnesses are no laughing matter. It is disheartening to see the public and the media trivialize her story instead of reaching out to support her. The public’s lack of respect and compassion for Bynes is an indicator of a larger problem that sweeps America: ignorance of mental health issues.
Actress Jennifer Lawrence, who portrayed a young woman who befriended a man affected by bipolar disorder in the film Silver Linings Playbook, shed light on this issue following her Oscar win: “It’s just so bizarre how in this world if you have asthma, you take asthma medicine. If you have diabetes, you take diabetes medicine. But as soon as you have to take medication for your mind, it’s such a stigma behind it,” she told Parade.
Hard facts reinforce Lawrence’s sentiments. A recent survey suggested that “negative public attitudes toward people who have poor mental health could take a generation to shift.”
Until the public is further educated about such illnesses, hateful comments will persist.
For example, one Twitter user stated, “When I heard about what happened at Venice Beach … I thought Amanda Bynes escaped from a mental hospital and did it.”  Others have used her name and negative descriptors interchangeably: “Some days I feel like Beyonce, and other days I’m Amanda Bynes. Idk just depends.”
At first glance, these comments appear harmless. But when they’re coupled with tabloid stories assaulting her identity, it’s evident that society has contributed to her downward spiral.
Fellow Nickelodeon star Nick Cannon chimed in on this problem when he penned an open letter to Bynes in his blog.
“So I ask people who are quick to judge, tweet, report or comment to ask yourself; what if that person was my sister? My brother? My mother? Or me? What then would I say? In the words of the great poet and artist Bill Withers, ‘Sometimes in our lives we all have pain, we all have sorrow.’”
We must keep in mind that there are millions of Amandas in this world — that is, there are millions of people struggling with mental illnesses such as OCD, anxiety and depression. These are people who are often shunned by society because the media portrays them as knife-wielding murderers — as the crazy people. But beneath the complicated diagnoses, those afflicted by mental illnesses are people first and foremost — people who need kindness and compassion so that they can heal in due time.
So whether a person is a celebrity or just a peer, it’s the fact that he or she is a person that matters the most. No matter who he or she is or where he or she comes from, no matter his or her class or race, each individual deserves understanding instead of judgment — especially when that person has a serious disorder. When we all remember this on a daily basis, hate will slowly vanish.
And maybe, just maybe, we’ll have our beloved Amanda back.

Inspire discussion on mental illness? There’s enough discussion on that. What we should be discussing is what is going on in Hollywood. Why is Dave Chappell going to Africa? Why are Michael Jackson’s kids suicidal? Why isn’t Britney spears allowed to use the internet or make her own decisions? What exactly gave Amanda PTSD?
