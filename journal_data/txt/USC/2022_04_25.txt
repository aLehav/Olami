The No. 1 ranked Trojans lost in the MPSF conference tournament final 11-9 last weekend to familiar foe No. 2 Stanford. 
The Cardinal beat USC for the second time this season and denied USC a fourth consecutive MPSF title. This was the Trojans’ first loss in nearly two months, as their eight-game winning streak comes to a close.
USC started the weekend off promisingly with a convincing 10-8 win against No. 6 UC Berkeley in the semi final match. The Trojans allowed 4 goals on the Golden Bears’ first four possessions of the game and then held them to that same amount for the final 27 minutes of play. 
Redshirt sophomore driver Alejandra Aznar led the way for USC as she totaled 3 goals and 2 assists in the contest. Aznar currently sits tied for third in the MPSF with 1.8 assists per game on the season.
After the strong showing Saturday, the Trojans had high hopes for the final against Stanford Sunday. However, USC fell behind early, and after a yellow card was shown to Head Coach Marko Pintaric, the Trojans went behind 6-3 right before halftime. 
It was looking grim for USC, but after halftime, the team showed why they are ranked as the No. 1 team in the country. The Trojans would go on a 4-1 run and retake the lead early in the fourth quarter. Unfortunately, USC could not stop Stanford’s attack as it finished off the game and any comeback hopes the Trojans had.
It was a valiant effort by USC, especially for redshirt junior driver Paige Hauschild, who tallied 4 goals in the contest. She commended the team’s tight defense in the third period.
“We really wanted to focus on our defensive mistakes that we made in the second quarter … and really try to fix those in the second half,” said Hauschild in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “We didn’t play like ourselves in the second quarter, and we wanted to bounce back from that as much as we could. It always starts with defense, so we came out in the second half with a lot of energy.”
Overall, the game was very physical, especially for redshirt sophomore 2-meter Tilly Kearns. Kearns drew 7 exclusions throughout the game and earned 2 penalty shots. 
The newly awarded All-MPSF first-team member also picked up 3 goals and 2 steals in the contest.
“That was definitely one of the more physical games I’ve played … but it was great that I was able to open up those opportunities,” Kearns said. “I think it put them on the backfoot and we hit them hard and made them react.” 
Despite the loss, USC has secured an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament. In two weeks, Pintaric hopes to lead the Trojans to their second consecutive national championship. 
Pintaric, who repeated as MPSF head coach of the year earlier this week, said he is preparing the team intensely for the upcoming tournament.
“We’re looking forward to what’s to come, and I’m very proud of the way they play, everybody in the pool. Mistakes were made … but everybody makes mistakes and you learn from it,” Pintaric said. “Sleep, eat, study and compete. That’s the next two weeks for us and that’s it, so that’s going to be the key for us.”
The Trojans’ next time competing in the pool will be as the No. 2 overall seed in the NCAA tournament when they take on Fresno State May 6.

USC’s Information Sciences Institute, a component of the Viterbi School of Engineering, launched a new career track for its research engineers March 1. In recognition of the unique contribution of software engineers in research teams, the overhaul aimed to promote professional growth and address multiple human resource issues within the department.
ISI, which focuses on research and development in information processing and computing, previously provided only two positions for research engineers, which deprived research engineers many valuable opportunities for career development.
“Here at ISI, for many many years, we had Research Programmers I and II, and that was sort of it, even though we have some very talented research engineers who have been with us for many years or come to us with a lot of experience,” said Dr. Terry Benzel, director of the networking and cybersecurity division at ISI who also served as a member of the committee that proposed the new career path.
As such, ISI set out to follow a movement initiated in England about ten years ago that recognized the uniqueness of the software engineer role in research teams. Particularly, ISI developed six positions designated for research engineers to stress the essential difference between research engineers and corporate programmers. 
“In industry, a programmer is usually given a very firm specification of what they need to write,” Benzel said. “For me, a research engineer is part of my team. They’re contributing to the research because we don’t always know what we’re building, and we’re exploring what are the kinds of things we need to be doing.”
ISI dropped some technical terms, such as“programmer” or “software,” in its titles to make new positions applicable to all types of engineers. Also, management skills and experience are not mandatory, providing promotion opportunities to research engineers with diversified working styles.
“ISI really tries to be a place where lots of different kinds of people can work,” said Elizabeth Boschee, research team leader and associate ISI director of the artificial intelligence division. “So, in terms of what you can do to be promoted, fundamentally, what it comes down to is a combination of taking more responsibility and achieving technical excellence.”
Through the new career system, ISI looked to solve another critical flaw: inconsistent titles. Following the lack of career development in the prior system, several research engineers opted to explore other career paths like programmer analysts to get promoted. 
“USC has many, many job titles … There was no clear sense of career trajectory.” Boschee said. “So, we wanted to make the whole path more principled and more transparent to the people who were involved.” 
Committee members expect the new career system to attract additional talent to ISI and boost the retention rate of current research engineers.
“It certainly will help with recruiting and make it really clear why you should be here,” Benzel said. “For retention, it is extremely important for people that are concerned about ‘What’s my advancement?’ They now see that there are ranges that they can move through, and they can have an expectation for promotions on a regular basis.”

Speeding down the streets of Los Angeles since the beginning of April — known to some as Armenian History Month — a lively, gold-colored food truck makes stops at community centers, high schools, businesses and churches. Its purpose, however, is not to serve meals but to collect stories. 
Memories from the Armenian diaspora, ranging from recollections of the Lebanese Civil War, stories of independence from the Soviet Union and the dating lives of Armenian young adults, have found their way into this truck-turned-mobile-studio as part of an oral history project known as #MyArmenianStory. 
Traveling around various areas in Southern California — home to almost 500,000 Armenian Americans — the project welcomes all to share their life stories and experiences. Set to be housed in the USC digital archive and in global collections, the collected records will look to serve as a primary source for research use.
The idea for oral history interviews began four years ago within the USC Institute of Armenian Studies.  Historians previously conducted interviews with camera crews inside residents’ homes around L.A. and contemplated branching out to different parts of the state and country.
The house visits halted in 2020 because of the start of the pandemic, but the pause gave the project new direction, said Gegham Mughnetsyan, a leading archivist in the USC Armenian Institute and a key figure in the project. When virtual interviews began, institute members thought of making the oral histories more accessible and available for people. The converted food truck became the newest vessel for the project, representing by design the fact that many Armenian Americans in the ’60s had their start in entrepreneurship by opening food truck businesses. 
Mughnetsyan said there is a unique power in listening to oral histories from individuals compared to typical documents and manuscripts. He also noticed that, when interviewees tell their unique life stories, it often brings up memories that they haven’t thought about in years.
“There is only one storyline in [a document], and it does not evolve,” Mughnetsyan said. “But when you are collecting oral histories through questions you asked, sometimes it brings up completely different tangents that people themselves didn’t think were important to mention, but turn out to be very crucial.” 
Mané Berikyan, a student worker on the project who helped conduct interviews, noticed interviewees answered questions in a wide variety of ways, with some viewing the project as a way to preserve family histories and some answering the questions more casually.
“I’ve had friends talk about their dating lives and people talk about their great great grandparents genocide survival story,” said Berikyan, a freshman majoring in international relations. “That also enriches the archive that we’re building and it’s going to give us a very wide variety of material to choose from in the future.”
Christine Almadjian, a junior majoring in law, history, and culture, said that prior to the #MyArmenianStory project, many of the stories surrounding Armenian identity she had heard focused on the deep wounds within the community, stemming from the 1915 Ottoman Empire genocide that caused the diaspora. Almadjian, who was invited to join the project August 2021, said the project has allowed her to hear joyful and empowering tales from her community.
“As a people, I feel like we’ve just experienced so much pain and so much suffering, and I feel like that’s at the forefront of a lot of the stories that we’ve heard in the past,’’ Almadjian said. “That generational trauma has embedded itself within each individual, regardless of status, but I feel like the stories have been able to be something of light and of positivity.” 
According to Mughnetsyan, the project has also gained interest from other Armenian communities in the Central Valley, and the mobile studio may continue to operate into the month of May.
“Even if it doesn’t continue directly into May, then it will definitely be returning for a similar mission, because there is now growing interest from other places too,” Mughnetsyan said.

USC secured the joint Pac-12 regular-season title after defeating Arizona State 15-13 Friday in Tempe. 
The Trojans entered the game at No. 17 in the IWLCA poll against the Sun Devils at No. 23. This game was one of the most important of the season as the winner not only secured a share of the Pac-12 regular-season crown but also a bye in the quarterfinal round of the Pac-12 Tournament. 
Sophomore midfielder Madison Waters and sophomore attackers Shelby Tilton and Claudia Shevitz led USC with 3 goals each. Senior defender Kaleigh Brennan picked up four ground balls and caused one.
Brennan spoke on the team’s morale coming off the win. 
“[We’re] feeling super excited and super good about where our team is going into our last game,” said Brennan in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Everyone is just super excited to get prepared for our last game and the tournament.”
Both teams displayed high intensity throughout all four quarters. Although the Trojans outshot Arizona State 37-16, the teams were 16-16 in the center circle and USC just barely had the edge in ground balls at 26-21. 
Although USC played a dominant first quarter, leading 6-3, the Sun Devils had a strong run in the second quarter and tied up the game 7-7 at the half. USC emerged in the second half with renewed energy and went on a 5-1 run in the third quarter. 
Head Coach Lindsey Munday credits the team’s poise and composure coming into the second half. 
“We do a really good job at not getting too rattled and [we] understand the mistakes we made and that we just have to get back to the way we play,” she said. “Just really proud of the poise we have and the ability to kind of let things go.” 
This on-field maturity was apparent in the fourth quarter. Although Arizona State went on another run, the Trojans pulled ahead by two goals, ran the clock out and secured the vital victory. 
USC’s last regular-season game will also be its senior day. Munday shows clear love and appreciation for the seniors who contributed on and off the field. 
“We have fifth-year seniors who decided to come back. We have people who chose to come to USC, whether it was a transfer or midyear. It’s really special,” she said. “The success we’ve had this season is because of leadership. They’ve welcomed our 12 freshmen and three transfers with open arms and have created a culture where it’s team first.”
Brennan said the senior class savors their final moments.
“We’re all super excited but emotional. We’ve all become super close with this group. Obviously, we have a lot of young players, and we’ve just been able to connect with them so much,” she said. “We’re so excited to have another opportunity with the team and to have a special day with them.”
The Trojans’ regular season Pac-12 championship was their second all-time and first since 2019 when they won the Tournament too.  
USC will play their final regular-season home game against UC Davis Saturday at 1 p.m.

Last November, FC Barcelona, one of the most popular clubs in the world, was in total shambles. 
Barcelona, who has won 10 league titles and four Champions Leagues since 2000, sat in ninth place in La Liga, mired in financial difficulties and playing unexciting, unsuccessful soccer. After a 1-0 defeat to Rayo Vallecano Oct. 27, the club fired manager Ronald Koeman, whose squad earned a third place finish last season, behind their mortal enemies Real Madrid and their crosstown rivals Atletico Madrid. 
The squad was poorly constructed and underperforming. In the summer transfer window, club legend and the best player in the world Lionel Messi, whose contract expired at the end of the 2020-21 season, left his boyhood club because of Barcelona’s bloated wage bill.
Messi’s departure meant Barcelona struggled challenge for the title this season, but it was also an emotional blow for Barça fans, who had grown used to Messi’s ability to win matches single-handedly. 
One man, though, appeared brave and dedicated enough to right the ship: Xavier Hernández Creus, best known simply as Xavi — a club legend who starred in midfield from the late ’90s until 2015, when he accepted a contract form Al Sadd in Qatar to ease into retirement. 
After retiring in 2019, Xavi immediately became Al Sadd’s manager, winning seven trophies with the Qatari club. By conventional standards, Xavi, with no European coaching experience, was underqualified for the Barcelona job. 
Yet, Xavi, who personifies all of Barcelona’s Catalan and footballing values, was perhaps the only man qualified to guide Barcelona out of the unholy situation into which the club’s hierarchy had guided it (except for his ex-teammate and mentor, Pep Guardiola, the current manager of Manchester City). 
Despite the hope and optimism Xavi’s presence brought, his job was never going to be easy. The club legends such as Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets were not getting any younger, while the club’s young breakout stars of the previous season, Ansu Fati and Pedri struggled with injuries. 
Additionally, a calf injury plagued striker Sergio Aguero, who the club had signed ostensibly to encourage Messi to stick around because of the pair’s friendship, limiting him to only five appearances before he tragically retired in December after being diagnosed with a cardiac arrhythmia. 
His first two months brought mixed results, but Xavi has successfully renovated Barcelona’s playing style and his changes have led to Barcelona finding some of their best form since former manager Luis Enrique left the club in 2017. 
Recent stumbles against Eintracht Frankfurt and Cádiz aside, Barcelona went on a 15-match unbeaten streak from Jan. 23 until April 14, drawing four matches and winning nine. The highlight of that was a 4-0 thrashing of Real Madrid on the road, their first El Clásico win in three years. 
How has he done it? Well, for starters, Xavi has implemented ideals popularized by his former coaches, Guardiola and Enrique. 
Barcelona has returned to using a flexible 4-3-3 formation,possession-oriented system. Yet, Xavi’s side is not a carbon copy of the Guardiola teams he played in during the late aughts and early 2010s. 
The current Barcelona resembles Guardiola’s current Manchester City team in the sense that, when attacking, Barcelona will have five players pushed against the opposition’s backline, stretching the field wide to create lateral gaps for midfielders and strikers to surge into and exploit. 
In that sense, the two midfielders ahead of Busquets in Xavi’s system do not actually play in a similar style to Xavi and his former midfield partner Andrés Iniesta. Whereas Xavi and Iniesta sat behind the front line, recycling play and creating chances from a deeper position, Frenkie de Jong and Pedri frequently make runs into the box to find shooting positions, scoring with some regularity. 
In fact, while this edition of Barcelona prefers keeping possession, they are not afraid to hit a ball over the top to their pacey forwards, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Ousmane Dembélé and recently acquired Ferrán Torres. The team’s not averse to directness when it benefits them and enjoys isolating its wingers against an opposition fullback. 
Dembélé and right winger Adama Traoré, who was signed on loan in January, have high success rates in one-one-one duels, so Xavi’s system frequently overloads one side of the pitch before switching the ball quickly over to the opposite winger, who looks to beat their defender on the dribble before sending in a cross or cutting back to oncoming runners. 
While Koeman’s side played unexciting soccer, Xavi’s team actually crosses the ball more frequently, with 15 per game. Their willingness to send crosses into the box further supports the notion that Xavi is pragmatic, playing Luuk de Jong, a great header of the ball, at striker for last ten minutes of a game when they need a goal or using Traore in a dribbling role that limits his need to make a killer pass or finish difficult chances. 
The future looks cautiously bright for Barcelona. Xavi continues to reinvigorate the team’s tactics and work ethic, earning a trademark victory against Real Madrid to announce the Xavi era. 
The club appears to have made prudent signings in January, with Torres, Aubameyang and Traore all making key contributions to the team since their arrival. Barcelona probably has the best collection of young midfielders in the world, with Pedri, Gavi — who’s still only 17 and a key player in Xavi’s plans — and Frenkie de Jong. 
If the club manages to steer clear of further financial issues, they look poised to make a genuine title challenge as soon as next season. Will Xavi be the next iconic Barcelona coach in a long line of greats? Only time will tell, but he stands as good a chance as anyone.

Our generation is filled with #materialgworl, being raised especially to take care of goods that have a lot of value to them, whether the value is monetary or sentimental. As a result, I — a #materialgworl myself — was terrified to damage anything that was “rich” or “expensive.”
This fear is a universal experience, especially in the world of luxury. When we can afford things that were once out of budget, we want the magic of its pristine condition to be immortal. 
People will spend $800 on Christian Louboutin red bottom heels to have them sit in the closet or save up $200 for a Byredo perfume to only display the bottle. And, some will find comfort in keeping their $20,000 red Kelly Hermes bag safe in their closet shelf. 
I see this fear, albeit understandable, as the beginning of the separation between art and fashion. While, arguably, anything can be constituted as art because art itself is subjective, art does not have to only be one thing — it can be functional, wearable or even life-saving. But when an item is traditionally categorized within fashion but isn’t actively used, it becomes an object and an object only. 
Still, on an opposite end of the spectrum, buyers will truly aim to “get their money’s worth.” Sticking to the classic Birkin and Kelly from Hermes, two great examples are Jane Birkin and Mary-Kate Olsen. 
Birkin, a British actress, was actually the muse for the iconic bag. After dropping her Hermes diary and telling the then-chief executive, Jean-Louise Dumas that she would give up her signature bag if Hermes designed a large and practical bag with pockets, Dumas sketched the design with Birkin on an airplane sickness bag. Keeping true to her word, she donned the bag wherever she went, stuffing it to the point many would deem “disgraceful” today. 
Similarly, Olsen milked her beloved Kelly for every penny’s worth. Even showing up in Vogue’s article, “Relax — Take Pride in Your Beat-Up Bags,” and another article based on her bag alone, titled “Mary-Kate Olsen Is Onto Something With Her Beaten-Up Handbags,” the Olsen twin was famous for using her bag until its very last straw, often with the leather fading, the hardware scratched and the flap hanging open. 
Of course, there are other consumers who believe in escalating the value of their items through personalization. One company that famously offers services of personalization is Louis Vuitton. While the brand itself doesn’t shy away from major influences in the art world such as Takashi Murakami and Yayoi Kusama, there is a team of “artisans” within the house whose sole job is to paint illustrations or monograms on bags and luggage. 
Another example is Heart Evangelista, a Filipina actress, food-chain heiress and socialite, who began painting on her Birkin bags after spilling some cheese fries on her orange, lizard-skin bag. Since then, she has continued to paint on and customize her Hermes bags and other items in her closet. 
While each decision — the extent of usage with the bag and whether or not personalization is added — changes with each consumer, it brings into question if the value of the bag then changes. 
Bags such as Hermes’s Birkin and Kelly, Louis Vuitton’s Neverfull and Gucci’s Jackie will continue to appreciate in value but are hard to afford in the first place. If consumers want to have the options to resell or pass down items with actual value, should they avoid the wear and tear of everyday use and personalizations? Or will the physical vintage feel and sentimental value of past personalities increase how much they are worth? 
Factors like previous owners, who customized it and the material of the goods will affect the outcome to this question, but the real answer will only emerge when the next generation comes along. I don’t have a time machine, but I do have a hunch: Vintage revival with a customized twist.

The opening image of “The Northman” is not that of a rampaging Viking but of a rumbling volcano. It’s an apt visual metaphor for what ultimately erupts into a red-hot, blood-soaked revenge saga filled with violence, vengeance and vespertine weapons. 
Taking a cue from Shakespeare himself, “The Northman” illustrates the most metal version of “Hamlet” ever made. The film plays out similar to an ancient poem of primal brutality, its folkloric nature providing an effective framework for the tale of fate and monomaniacal fury that ultimately unfolds. 
Volcanic imagery aside, it is often the characters themselves who are doing the exploding.
Our protagonist is the terrifying and vindictive Viking Prince Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), fittingly described in the film as “a beast cloaked in man-flesh.” When his duplicitous uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang) seizes the throne through murderous means, Amleth sets out to avenge the death of his father, King Aurvandil (Ethan Hawke). 
A single bloody mantra sustains Amleth, its message pounding in his skull akin to a steady heartbeat: “I will avenge you, Father. I will save you, Mother. I will kill you, Fjölnir.” If the plot of “The Northman” had to be summed up in only one line, this would be it. 
Writer and director Robert Eggers goes for the jugular in his third feature. Teeming with terse savagery and testosterone, “The Northman” marks his first departure from beloved indie film studio A24. 
The Focus Features-backed production may have a larger budget than his previous works (2015’s “The Witch” and 2019’s “The Lighthouse”), but make no mistake, Eggers’ fingerprints can still be seen in every frame. His unwavering commitment to period accuracy is commendable, as is his refusal to compromise his blistering cinematic vision for the sake of widespread approval.
The massive $90 million budget does have its downsides, however, especially for a rising auteur who comes from indie beginnings. While “The Witch” and “The Lighthouse” thrive in their magnificent minimalism, “The Northman” yields its mighty budget similar to a sword that is far too heavy for it to bear. Each extended sequence of unbridled ferocity, bloodlust and animalistic rage is independently impressive in scope and in scale, but, when strung together, it becomes increasingly clear that much of the film rests on polished visual flair as opposed to profundity. 
Yes, “The Northman” is an epic of, well, epic proportions — both visually and otherwise. This is, after all, a studio film; a blockbuster, by definition, albeit an eccentric one. While it is impossible to criticize his latest cinematic venture for lack of ambition (the final volcanic sword fight sequence is worth the price of admission alone), Eggers’ trademark weirdness seems to get lost in the Hollywood murk and studio interference of it all.
In short, it is a film whose individual parts are stronger than it as a whole. The parts, however, are absolutely riveting. 
A fairly linear revenge plot is elevated by several standout performances. Swedish-born Skarsgård  shines in every bone-crunching battle scene; the self-proclaimed Viking enthusiast proves his passion for the project with every bead of sweat. Anya Taylor-Joy, the breakout star of Eggers’ directorial debut “The Witch,” plays Olga, an enslaved Slavic woman who crosses paths with Amleth in act two. She serves as an intelligent scene partner for Skarsgård, showcasing his character’s humanity in the film’s quieter moments. 
Icelandic force of nature Björk returns to the big screen for the first time since “Dancer in the Dark” (2000), playing yet another blind character who sees the world more clearly than those who surround her. And that’s not to mention the rest of “The Northman’s” star-studded cast (Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, Willem Dafoe), who, in spite of their minimal screen time, arguably make more of an impression than the main actors, delivering their lines with a wolfish intensity that would cause even the mightiest of Vikings to cower.
The film itself is a visually stunning, auditory odyssey that only Eggers could create. Every slash of a sword, every barbaric yawp, contributes to the cinematic atmosphere, leaving an impression as indelible as a battlescar in the brain.
“The Northman” concludes with the same volcano from the start, its apex angrily belching out lava as Amleth and Fjölnir have their fiery battle. As both man and volcano erupt, the visual spectacle marks the culmination of a journey, a journey that, despite foreseeable, goes out with a bang in true Eggers fashion.

Hitting play on a Spiritualized album is like signing yourself up for some obscure water deprivation therapy your friend told you about. Best known for their 1997 album “Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating In Space,” Spiritualized always manages to walk the line between the known and unknown. 
Dunking your head into their new album, “Everything Was Beautiful,” reveals layers of really solid production with lyrics that occupy themselves with all of life’s ups and downs. There’s joy, love and kindness here but also confusion, sadness and a fear of the unknown. 
Listening to Spiritualized feels as if frontman Jason Pierce invites you to step into the unknown. He has stuck with the band on and off for more than 30 years and continues to push himself towards his ultimate goal of finding either God or an explanation for life’s complexities. Or perhaps, he just likes getting high and writing saxophone solos. 
Pierce never holds himself back from creating hypnotic, all-encompassing tracks, and the opener, “Always Together With You,” holds those characteristics, which make it some of his best work on the album. It’s so dense that it feels almost suffocating — but in the best way. It reflects the subdued joy of being in love, with delightful lyrics like, “If you got a lonely heart / I would be a lonely heart for you / If you want a rocket ship / I would be a rocket ship for you.” The overlapping vocals near the end feel as if they belong in the climactic scene of a romance film, full of heart and earnestness.
The second track, “Best Thing You Never Had (The D Song),” shows more of Pierce’s rock side. An electric guitar carries us throughout, while a deep and apparent blues influence and gospel-like backing vocals bring up the emotion. The repeated chorus of “Gonna be a long ride down, the best thing you never had” turns it into a rousing song denouncing drugs and the disappointments of life. It’s not exactly too clear what Pierce is going against, but the emotion is still there. 
The next two tracks reflect Pierce’s talent in creating a soundtrack for life. “Everything Was Beautiful” feels perfect for those days where the details get a little hazy in your memory as time moves on, but it doesn’t matter because all you can remember is the pure love and happiness that you felt, tinged with slight melancholy.
 “Let It Bleed (For Iggy)” has a slower beginning that blossoms into something grand, with lyrics such as “I wanted it to say something so special and true / I wanted it to cut deeper and darker for you” that reflect a feeling of regret. Pierce manages to capture the ache of having all these overpowering emotions and yet never verbalizes them correctly. On the other hand, “Crazy” comes off as a sweet, if a little plaintive, love song with a folksy influence. Pierce, conflicted over a relationship, croons “And I know you can’t love me now, not today / All of my thoughts are of you / But I hope in time that we might find a way.” 
“The Mainline Song / The Lockdown Song” is a Springsteen-esque track that is slightly fuzzier around the edges. It feels as if you’re racing down a two-lane highway, wind whipping through hair and pure openness ahead of you. While “The A Song (Laid In Your Arms)” catapults the listener in a different direction, with a cinematic instrumental opening that leads us into its seven minute runtime, second longest only to the closer. Full of contrasts, the song leans on a variation of “One man’s crime is another man’s thrill” repeatedly throughout the track. Druggy imagery swirls around the listener as Pierce divides their mind in two, even using a quite literal divide of the song itself in an instrumental bridge of paranoid sound that quickly becomes grating. 
To conclude the album, “I’m Coming Home Again” serves as a powerful and melancholic closer for the album. Here, Pierce reminds us that despite all the soul-searching and wandering throughout life of the previous tracks, he is no closer to figuring out the meaning of anything. Leaving us with something to think about, Pierce sings, “I’ve been there and I’ve been back again / Gonna dull it with lorazepam / Kind’ve had it with philosophy, ‘cause I’m thinking I am, but I’m failing to be.”
However, Spiritualized isn’t for everyone. The final three tracks, while all quite lovely in their own ways, have long runtimes and the meandering sound can become annoying for those unfamiliar with longer tracks. Spiritualized sometimes feels like the album version of a drawn-out high, and at times, the songs can blend into each other in a way not reflective of their quality. 
Overall, it’s an album chock full of the ups and downs of life reflected in tracks bursting with sound and emotion. Spiritualized manages to make seven tracks and close to 44 minutes count to the fullest, while still unable to answer the biggest question on Jason Pierce’s mind.

The presence of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival is almost inescapable. Whether it’s scrolling through Twitter to catch up on memes or hopping on Instagram to post a story, you’re bound to see some Coachella content from your mutuals. Whether it’s Fred Again..’s set or Doja Cat talking about Taco Bell, there’s endless content to pop up onto your feed. 
Coachella is one of the largest music festivals in the United States, so it’s a no-brainer as to why you’re seeing it everywhere on social media. Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said that Coachella has so much cultural importance that what happens at Coachella tends not to stay there. Trends in music, fashion and performing might be birthed over these weekends in the Coachella Valley. So whether you like it or not, it can be incredibly hard to avoid seeing the festival online since some aspects of Coachella bleed into the overarching cultural sphere. 
So naturally, you’ll feel FOMO, because who likes seeing other people enjoy unprecedented moments such as 2NE1’s reunion? Of course it sucks to see your peers enjoying themselves while you’re in Leavey preparing for your final exams, but that doesn’t have to be the case. 
If you’re not at Coachella, there’s probably a good reason why — the $449+ ticket (along with all other costs) is too expensive, you have too much schoolwork to catch up on, or your coworkers wouldn’t cover your Friday shift. All these problems detail priorities that trump the festival. Being cognizant of this can help you realize that you’re actually making smart financial decisions and that there’s nothing to feel left out about. After all, the outrageous ticket price is just a commodity for those that are privileged enough to afford it. 
Those that do purchase Coachella tickets are contributing to wealthy companies that do little to acknowledge the farmworkers and neighboring communities that run the city throughout the rest of the year. Goldenvoice, the company that runs the festivals, makes hundreds of millions of dollars while over a third of the population of the Eastern Coachella Valley lives in poverty. Polo’s Pantry’s — a mobile food  pantry — Instagram post details the reality of the Coachella Valley farmworkers, as well as organizations that they urge festival goers to support marginalized communities. 
Along with unaffordable festival tickets, the festival had little to no mandates on masking, vaccinations or coronavirus testing. Some of the artists playing the festival have expressed their concerns about touring and live music. Though the festival is outside, there still is a risk of catching and spreading the virus in tightly packed crowds under tents and other areas where large scale gatherings occur. 
So, curb your Coachella FOMO by choosing to support underserved communities as well as smaller musicians and live shows. You can still experience live music for under $20 at a plethora of venues across L.A., such as the Moroccan Lounge or smaller shows thrown by fellow Trojans. 29th St. Productions, Cup of Troy and EngageSC host various live music and social events, where you can feed your yearning for festival-like experiences. 
As humans, we will still instinctively search for ways to avoid the pain of missing out, so the easiest way to avoid FOMO is to simply avoid consuming Coachella content entirely. Of course, that’s easier said than done, so an effective way to do this is to temporarily block people and artists where you might see the content — or just get off social media entirely and take a mindful detox. 
Nonetheless, all of this isn’t to say that buying 2023 Coachella tickets to see Frank Ocean is a bad idea. Part of going to the festival is about acknowledging the privilege it requires to be able to purchase tickets, and how to utilize this privilege in a way that works against wealthy companies and assists underserved communities. 
Remember that it’s natural to feel FOMO and that there are ways to curb it — or maybe you’ll realize that you actually aren’t missing out on much.

When I glance at news headlines, I often feel ill-equipped to make a difference.  Last month, for example, I read that MacKenzie Scott donated $275 million dollars to Planned Parenthood, the largest-ever contribution to the organization. 
Flashy, multimillion dollar donations attract attention because they instantaneously impact an organization. While I applaud giving away excessive wealth, most people do not have hundreds of millions of dollars to spare. This singular focus on philanthropy fuels the misconception that only millionaires and billionaires can afford to make a difference.
Lucy Bernholz, a research scholar at Stanford University’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society, said, “Most books written about philanthropy [are] about rich people and I wanted to know what was happening with everyone else.” 
Although my column focuses on large nonprofits, politics or public figures, most of the important work happens day-to-day within small interactions. 
People do not need power, influence or an outrageously large piggy bank to enact change. Instead, they need persistence and the genuine desire to do good.
Even when a person cannot support an organization financially, they can still volunteer time and energy as many understaffed organizations depend on voluntary support to fulfill their missions. There are many opportunities for USC students to volunteer such as USC’s Volunteer Center which helps students get involved with local organizations through events such as Friends and Neighbors Day. The Joint Educational Project on campus also connects students to various volunteer programs such as schools, community-based organizations, healthcare facilities and legal clinics. 
Oftentimes when no current organization exists to solve a specific problem, people team up with others and create their own organizations to fill the gap.  In summer 2020, at the height of coronavirus, USC students Aria Cataño, Kate Montanez and Catie Cummings began Water Drop LA, which brings water to people experiencing homelessness on Skid Row. Currently, through its fully volunteer-run organization, Water Drop LA distributes more than 2,000 gallons of water each week.
I’d be naive to assume, however, that everyone has time to volunteer extensive hours. Although my column focuses on nonprofits, the problems of bureaucracy, formality and on boarding can make them an inconvenient, slow-paced option. In fact, as I’ve shown throughout my column, the nonprofit sector’s faults limit its effectiveness. 
We can take every day as an opportunity to do something positive, even in the smallest way. Doing good is as simple as picking up a neighbor’s groceries or dropping off a can at a food drive or maybe listening to a friend and comforting them on a particularly bad day. Small acts add up.
Don’t get me wrong. I understand that while individual acts are powerful, they cannot solely lead to broad transformation without parallel changes in institutions and systemic issues. But, if we believe every ounce of progress needs to be a grand act worthy of a history textbook, nothing would get done. Change does not only happen drastically but also progressively. In reality, most people who make a difference don’t leave a legacy or work for a prestigious nonprofit. Behind every famous activist are hundreds of people working tirelessly without recognition. 
I know my outright optimism in this article feels vastly different to my more critical arguments about the nonprofit sector. Don’t worry, I still love to be a hater. To criticize something means to believe improvement is possible. I wouldn’t bother writing if I thought the nonprofit sector or any of its issues are beyond repair. Understanding how society falls short allows us to dream bigger for the future. It helps me to maintain a balance between optimism and criticism. 
As my graduation nears, I am faced with a lot of endings, with one of the most difficult being this column in the Daily Trojan. In the last two years, writing “Progress Without Profit” gave me the courage to share my thoughts, take up space and argue for the things I want to see change. Because of this, while I’m still not exactly sure what life will bring post-college, I am sure of who I want to be, and the kind of work I wish to accomplish — and that is enough.
 Here’s to all of us leaving a positive mark on this world.
