The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Tuesday, April 23, and Saturday, April 27. 
Crimes against a person
At 1:41 A.m on April 27, a student reported that a suspect punched him in the eye when he attempted to intervene in an argument outside Sigma Delta Tau sorority.  The suspect then fled on foot and  could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
Crimes against property
At 4:22 P.m. on April 27, loss prevention officers monitoring Superior Market observed a student pick up two bottles of alcohol and place them in a bag containing other items he had already purchased.  The officers detained the student when he exited the store without paying for the alcohol and he was taken into custody by DPS officers who responded to the scene.  The student was then arrested and transported to 77th Station for booking.
at 7:33 A.m. on April 23, a manager at Del Taco reported that he observed several subjects dumping sand bags in the restaurant’s trash bins.  The subjects drove away in a truck when the manager attempted to talk to them, but he was able to obtain a vehicle license plate number, which he subsequently provided to DPS officers for further investigation.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 7:47 P.m. on April 26, DPS officers responded to a student who collided with a university vehicle while riding his bicycle near Gwynn Wilson Student Union. The student was not injured and there was no visible damage to his bike or the university vehicle.
at 7:35 P.m. on April 25, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspicious unattended bag outside Fluor Tower and while they were investigating, an RA advised them that it was a laundry bag that was dropped off for the building’s faculty advisor.  The officers then cleared the scene.

A suspicious package that turned out to be nothing more than an abandoned suitcase filled with socks and coins prompted the Dept. of Public Safety to send out a Trojans Alert on Monday afternoon. The alert warned individuals to stay away from the area of Figueroa Street and Exposition Boulevard.

The Trojans Alert system allows DPS to send out emergency messages to members of the USC community.
Los Angeles Police Department received a phone call that a suspicious package was left near the Tuscany apartments, according to DPS Capt. David Carlisle. The caller was a pedestrian who had walked by the area and seen the bag, Carlisle said.
“At about 12:15 [p.m.] we got a call that on the 37th block of South Figueroa there was an unattended suitcase left there for a while,” said Christopher Ngo, a LAPD media relations spokesperson.
The Trojans Alert was then released at approximately at 1:23 p.m. because of DPS’ concerns over student safety as LAPD was called to the scene for precautionary measures.
“When we discovered that  [LAPD was] blocking the street, we decided that it was appropriate to notify our students to stay out of that area,” Carlisle said.
After officers were unable to identify the bag’s owner, they called the LAPD bomb squad to the scene to further investigate the package’s contents, according to Ngo.
“Officers arrived at the location and observed the suitcase, then called the bomb squad, which responded around 12:54 [p.m.] and checked the surrounding area,” Ngo said.
A second Trojan Alert message was sent out at approximately 1:29 p.m. — just minutes after the first alert — stating that it was safe to return to the area and that police activity was over.
“They went in and searched the briefcase and found nothing,” Ngo said. “All that was found inside the bag was socks and coins.”
This is the second instance of a suspicious package left near the University Park Campus this month.
A package was left on April 18 near the entrance at McClintock and Jefferson avenues, and the campus was blocked off from the Waite Phillips Hall to the Lyon Center. As the LAPD bomb squad was en route to campus, the package was determined to be just a black bookbag.

The Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy announced Saturday the creation of a $6 million fundraising initiative, believed to be the largest in the history of occupational therapy higher education programs.
The funds raised will go toward the university’s $6 billion multi-year fundraising effort, known as the Campaign for the University of Southern California. According to USC’s website, 188,709 donors have contributed a total $2.4 billion to the Campaign as of April 24.
The announcement was made April 27 in San Diego, Calif. at the annual conference of the American Occupational Therapy Association.
Associate Dean Florence Clark said the campaign will bring improvements to the division.
“USC has an undeniable legacy of leadership to the profession of occupational therapy, and we are the founders of the occupational science discipline,” Clark said in a statement. “This campaign will take USC occupational science and occupational therapy to an even higher level, and I am so excited to have the entire Trojan Family join together in this unprecedented adventure.”
U.S. News & World Report’s 2014 rankings placed the Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy in the No. 1 spot in March. The division has held the top ranking for 11 of the last 15 years.
The division, which was created in 1942 in response to a growing demand for clinicians to rehabilitate military personnel during World War II, celebrated  last year the 70th anniversary of its founding at USC.
USC launched its $6 billion campaign in August 2011 to increase support for academic priorities, capital projects and infrastructure. The campaign has sought contributions from individual donors, foundations and corporations.
Forty-eight percent of donations have been put toward academic priorities and 38 percent of donations are endowments for schools and scholarships, according to USC’s website. Fourteen percent has been designated as capital.
The goal of the division is to help people build healthy and satisfying lives by generating knowledge about the field and educating practitioners and researchers in occupational science. The division studies participation in daily activities and its relationship to healthy living over a lifespan.

Three professors in the Viterbi School of Engineering have won three of ten contracts from a research program that aims to increase efficiency of low-powered electronics, USC announced Friday.
The Power Efficiency Revolution For Embedded Computing Technologies Program, or PERFECT Program, is a division in the government’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (or DARPA) that not only deemphasizes constructing hardware, but also focuses more on the impact of the existing technology. DARPA, which was launched in 1958 as a response to the Sputnik launch, is used by software companies and the U.S. military to promote military projects.
Michael Fritze, Massoud Pedram and Viktor Prasanna received contracts that will fund their continuing research in ultra low-power microelectronics. The research aims to lower the consumption of power that certain electronic devices use by 64 times less than what the current systems utilize.
The competitors included professors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and UC Berkeley, and Viterbi received more contracts than any other university.
The professors, whose three contracts combined are a multi-million dollar deal to fund research for energy conservation, will focus on the benefit of low-powered devices and the dependability of such systems.
A research professor of electrical engineering and electrophysics, Fritze created the low-powered circuits that are installed in computers and military electronic systems. The systems are also known as field programmable gate arrays, or FPGA. Fritze’s work has resulted in the lowest-powered FPGAs in the world, according to the Viterbi School of Engineering. Prasanna, who is the Charles Lee Powell Chair in Engineering and a professor of electrical engineering and computer science, was recognized for his work in signal-processing algorithms that work with low-powered devices.
Pedram, an associate professor of electrical engineering systems, won for the development of low-powered circuits that are thinner than a single sheet of paper.
John Damoulakis, the deputy director of advanced electronics at Viterbi’s Information Sciences Institute, said the systems can be applied to multiple industries.
“The university has a long history of developing capable ultra-low-power microelectronics,” Damoulakis said. “These professors have spent decades designing low-powered devices and systems that can be applied to both commercial and military industries.”

Panelists reflected Monday on the 1992 riots in Los Angeles and discussed their effect on the current state of race relations at Doheny Memorial Library.
Speaking out · Journalist Erin Aubry Kaplan, who studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, discusses the current state of race relations in L.A. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
 
The program was part of the Visions and Voices program, the university’s arts and humanities initiative.
The panel featured three professionals who studied the 1992 L.A. riots. Erin Aubry Kaplan, an award-winning journalist and a columnist for the Los Angeles Times and LA Weekly, focused on the effect of the riots on the city’s black community.
Kaplan emphasized that discourse around of black justice has been slowly disappearing since the time of the riots to now.
“We talk about Latinos, immigrants, gays, but we don’t talk nearly enough about black people as a whole,” Kaplan said. “African-Americans are becoming less and less visible.”
The panel discussed topics ranging from racial profiling and the Los Angeles Police Department to the geography of wealth versus poverty in Southern California. Panelists also discussed relations between black, Korean and Latino communities as well as the rebuilding efforts in post-riot South Los Angeles.
Darnell Hunt, director of the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA, noted that it is often difficult to hold honest conversations about racial conflict today.
“We have the facade of racial progress, but in reality it’s a different story,” Hunt said. “We can’t talk about it because we’ve supposedly moved past it. It’s difficult now.”
Another panelist, Dae Hoon Kim, a filmmaker and founder of the Korean American Film Festival New York who directed a new documentary concerning the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, emphasized the need for objectivity and for society to be more open-minded about racial issues.
“In reality, all of us, to a large degree, are ignorant,” Kim said. “Unless we start coming together and stop being political, we won’t have a full picture on the topic.”
Some students, many of whom have no memory of the riots, said the discussion provided a stimulating learning experience in terms of the history of Los Angeles.
“Before coming to this event, I didn’t know much about the [1992 riots],” said Katherine Lee, a sophomore majoring in biomedical engineering. “I learned how race played a huge role through this event, how the riots actually happened and what people hope for today.”
Other students believed the event helped them receive a more concrete understanding of race relations. Louige Oliver, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, found the discussion to be rewarding.
“I thought it was really interesting in that it gave me a lot of perspectives about race, both current and past,” Oliver said.
Some students were worried about the current state of race relations in Los Angeles. Connie Ge, a junior majoring in history, emphasized that Los Angeles neighborhoods today are still suffering from the same conditions they were under in 1992.
“I learned that the same problems that caused the riots are still not being addressed,” Ge said. “There is still a lot of poverty, discrimination, police brutality and not enough business initiatives that make people feel that they have a stake in their neighborhoods.”
Kaplan’s father, Larry Aubry, a prominent scholar, who specializes in civil rights, also served on the panel.
Though the riots occurred more than 20 years ago, Aubry remained adamant that it still has significance to the current state of race relations as it did in the past.
“Race does matter. It’s a perpetual thing,” Aubry said. “Whatever exists then still exists now.”
Don’t talk about African-American enough? Really? Ever wonder why first generation Asian come to this country just as poor if not more then blacks who have lived in the same LA neighborhoods for generations – but the first generation Asian end up going to universities and quickly become professionals leading productive lives. Meanwhile, the blacks continue to struggle and complain and shake their fist at the system but are not moving ahead. It is not because whitey society just arbitrarily decides to allow Asians to move ahead and hold blacks behind. It is because the Asians have a strong WORK ETHIC – which is paramount and rises above and beyond any tired discussion about “racial equality”. BTW – a black man making babies and then abandoning the family will do more damage to those children then any “racial inequality” that the NAACP tries to scrape up. Also – go to any South Central high school and just look at the behavior of the black students in the classroom. No respect and no discipline and they give their teachers a hard time. geez – I wonder why these kids just end up without any marketable skills – something that keeps them impoverished into their adult life. These supposed Black Leaders need to do their communities a favor and start cleaning up their own house before doing the tired finger pointing that they have grown accustomed to for over 40 years…

Facing the No. 5 team in the country in Oregon State,  the USC baseball team figured to have its hands full this past weekend in Corvallis, Ore.
They might have underestimated just how full, however.
The Beavers (34-8, 14-4 Pac-12) swept away the Trojans (16-26, 8-13) in their three-game set, and only one game could be considered a close one. Oregon State is in a battle with the rival Oregon Ducks to host a regional this year, and the Trojans expected the talented Beavers to come out with a vengeance after losing two of three to Washington the weekend before.
“We did nothing [offensively],” USC head coach Dan Hubbs said. “This is the first weekend where I felt like we just got beat up all weekend. We got out-manned, out-played, out-pitched, out-everything.”
The Beavers boast one of the nation’s best ERAs at an incredible 2.02. USC, however, has shown its ability to get hits off some of the nation’s best pitchers, knocking 13 against Oklahoma’s likely first-round draft pick Dillon Overton and seven against Stanford’s Marc Appel, who could be picked first overall in this June’s MLB draft.
But in Corvallis this weekend, the Trojans managed just 17 hits over the three games. For comparison’s sake, the Beavers had 20 on Friday alone.
“Really, all we did offensively is we hit three solo home runs,” Hubbs said. “Otherwise, they handed us our other runs.”
The only game that USC had a chance in, according to Hubbs, was Saturday’s. Sophomore starter Wyatt Strahan tossed 7 2/3 innings, allowing just three runs on five hits. But, as was the case all weekend, the Trojans’ bats could generate nothing against the Beavers’ arms.
Even on Friday, with junior ace Bob Wheatley keeping USC in the game for six innings, Hubbs said he felt the Trojans never had a chance.
The Trojans were again unable to salvage a win on Sunday with freshman Kyle Twomey on the mound. Twomey experienced the youthful control issues that have so plagued the Trojans this year, giving up four walks and a hit-by-pitch over four innings.
“Saturday was the only game I felt like we were in,” Hubbs said. “Even Friday, though we were only down 3-1” — the Beavers eventually blew the game open with three runs in the seventh and four in the eighth — “it just didn’t feel like we were going to be able to do anything. We were getting mauled at the plate. It felt like it might as well have been 12-1 when it was 3-1. They beat us up.”
It won’t get that much easier for USC today as it faces Pepperdine in Malibu, Calif. The Waves had the weekend off, meaning the Trojans can expect to see Sunday starter Aaron Brown.
Brown has a 1.52 ERA in his last three starts, including a complete game against Gonzaga in his last time out.
“We’re going to get pot-shotted by one of their weekend guys,” Hubbs said, referencing to the fact that midweek games usually see lesser pitchers start on the mound.
That won’t exactly be the case for USC, either. Junior Sean Silva, who has established himself as one of the team’s more reliable pitchers, will start on the mound for the Trojans.
Though Silva has worked his last few starts under a pitch count, he will go as long as he can tomorrow to spare the team’s bullpen a much-needed day off.
“He’s earned a little more leash,” Hubbs said of Silva.
The junior hasn’t allowed a run in his last three appearances and has seen his ERA drop from 11.57 to 4.05 in that span.
First pitch for today’s game is set for 3 p.m. The game will mark USC’s eighth consecutive road game, and during that stretch the Trojans are currently 3-4. The team has not played at Dedeaux Field since April 14.
Time to say goodbye to Coach Hubbs when this season ends. Another former Cal coach who did nothing
at USC. This program has become a sad entity for too long now.

Mom didn’t react well to the adriamycin, or the cytoxan.
This was Jan. 4, 2005, a Tuesday. My dad was carrying my mother as they slammed through the front door of our Burbank home. She was having difficulty even standing alone, and so he walked her through the house and onto the bed.
This Tuesday marked week one of chemotherapy treatment, coming roughly six weeks after the breast cancer diagnosis.
Full recovery · One year after missing the Trojans play for a national championship because of illness, Kim Kaufman and her son Joey were in attendance at the 2006 Rose Bowl to watch USC play the Texas Longhorns. — Courtesy of Joey Kaufman
I was 14. My brother Matt was 11; my sister Kelly had just reached 7. We sat in the family room, watching football. Meanwhile, Mom collapsed on her bed, nauseated. She proceeded to vomit. A couple hours later, the nausea subsided and she finally caught some sleep.
We dared not move from the couch. We stayed and stared at the TV. We didn’t know what to say.
Dad later emerged from their bedroom. He said he would take care of the rest and assured us Mom would be fine. We nodded.
He was right. She would be — it’d take a year, but yes, she would be fine. Dad didn’t lie. She still is fine.
But on that January night, at least, Mom was missing the game.
The game was the 2005 Orange Bowl, also the BCS national championship game. Undefeated USC, Dad’s alma mater and, by association, the official college football team of the Kaufman household, was facing No. 2 Oklahoma.
But Mom couldn’t see any of it. She couldn’t see the touchdown passes from Matt Leinart that sliced the Sooners’ secondary. She couldn’t see the Trojans’ “Thunder and Lighting” duo of LenDale White and Reggie Bush that dodged one defender after another. She couldn’t see a Shaun Cody and Mike Patterson-led defensive line that put opposing quarterback Jason White on his back on about every down.
But she could at least do this: She could wake up the next morning and read the newspapers. She could see that big headline from The Los Angeles Times reading “Conquest:” USC had defeated Oklahoma, 55-19.
You see, it was not uncommon for Mom, because of chemo, radiation treatment or some doctor’s appointment somewhere in Los Angeles, to miss seeing our Trojans play that year.
No matter, though — she always had the papers. And she trusted the newspapermen to bring her the news of the team. Was anyone hurt? How were those freshmen coming along? She’d always smile, too, when a picture of Leinart and his wavy surfer hair landed in print. He was her “sweetie,” we teased.
She didn’t always have the chance to witness everything that happened on the field with her own eyes. She relied on others, the reporters on the sidelines and in the press boxes, to paint the scene.
Seeing this, I always admired those newspaper writers.
In full disclosure, I had an interest in sports journalism from a young age, mostly because I discovered I was about a foot shy of ever having any chance to play center for the Los Angeles Lakers. Though I had little idea of what exactly journalism entailed, I wanted to work in sports.
Watching Mom read the paper, though, firmly cemented the goal of sports writing in my brain, and it gave me a greater purpose. I too would deliver the news to readers. I would tell them about their favorite teams. Maybe they were also missing the games because of something traumatic. They couldn’t always be around to smell the grass, to listen to the crowds, to feel the excitement. They wouldn’t always be in the stands.
So I promised to be there for them, in order to tell those stories.
Luckily enough for me, the Daily Trojan provided me with a chance to do just that. Covering USC sports for the last four years, and last two and a half years with this column, allowed me to live up to that set standard.
I’d cover Mom’s Trojans the best I could.
I’d capture moments, from women’s water polo’s NCAA championship season my freshman year to the most recent disappointing football season, where business remained unfinished. I’d chronicle teams and players.
I’ve seen Notre Dame Stadium (blaring “Crazy Train” and all) go from deafening to silent in one Jawanza Starling fumble recovery. I’ve seen Jacki Gemelos return to the basketball court after a fourth ACL surgery. Perhaps, most amusingly, I’ve seen Lane Kiffin as normal, talking about his own dad, Monte, and how, in a way, he was much like Brooks Hatlen from the movie The Shawshank Redemption.
Not every moment captured USC on its brightest day.
I’ve also seen the Trojans’ Rose Bowl dreams die in the mud after one swift, crushing and now infamous Anthony Barr sack of Matt Barkley. I’ve seen more press releases in response to NCAA-related allegations than I’d like to recount. I’ve seen basketball coach Kevin O’Neill explain the irreversible effects of scholarship limits to about every media member amid a school-worst 26-loss season.
It wasn’t exactly the rosiest four years — pun intended.
But there was no shortage of things to tell, and I tried to do those stories right. It was my turn. It was my turn to describe what the crowds looked like and what they sounded like. It was my turn to highlight players and coaches, peel back a layer and show the person. It was my turn to make sure I didn’t miss a single moment. Because this time, there’d be at least a few readers such as Mom relying on me.
I remember Ron Hock, a religion professor my junior year, telling me how he would read my column on his train ride back to his Palm Springs home. I remember the handwritten notes from Kent Hollenbeck, a Ventura County dentist whom I met for the first time in January, thanking me for my updates on men’s basketball, of all sports.
That was all I needed.
I wanted to depict USC athletics, both accurately and vividly. I wanted people to feel as if they were there alongside me.
Forever, this will be my own “Mom Rule.”

Entering the weekend as the No. 1 seed and boasting an undefeated record, the USC women’s tennis team expected nothing but success at the Pac-12 tournament in Ojai, Calif., this past weekend.
Hardware · Junior Kaitlyn Christian (above) teamed with sophomore Sabrina Santamaria to defend their Pac-12 doubles championship title. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
And backed by strong performances from its top players, the team came away with more hardware to add to its already impressive collection, as the doubles tandem comprising junior Kaitlyn Christian and sophomore Sabrina Santamaria won the doubles championship mere hours after Christian took home the invitational singles title.
The top-seeded duo of Christian and Santamaria has not lost a doubles match all season and continued that streak during this tournament, winning all four of their matches en route to a second-straight doubles title.
The final pitted the Women of Troy against a feisty UCLA tandem of Courtney Dolehide and Pamela Montez, but the Christian and Santamaria team won with ease in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3. The final match also served as their 30th straight doubles victory, certainly an impressive feat.
The pair has had a remarkable run of success in all sorts of tournament play, as this becomes their fourth tournament win. The duo has won the Pac-12 championship and the ITA National Indoor Championships twice each.
USC head coach Richard Gallien was understandably pleased with the efforts of his top doubles team.
“Credit Sabrina and Kaitlyn for adding another championship to their season,” Gallien said. “Sabrina was a star in the doubles final. She was hitting some amazing shots.”
That victory came only a few hours after Christian clinched the invitational singles title with a three-set victory over No. 2 seed Ellen Tsay of Stanford. Whereas the doubles portion of the tournament comprised of only 16 duos, the invitational singles champion comes from a pool of 64 players.
Christian earned a bye in the first round, but she still had to win five consecutive matches in order to clinch the title and was given only a brief rest before doubles play began.
A number of other USC players competed over the course of the weekend as a way to get more playing time in before the NCAA tournament.
In the pool of 32 singles championship, sophomores Giuliana Olmos, Gabriella DeSimone and Zoë Scandalis all competed but were unable to walk away with any hardware. Olmos and DeSimone advanced to the round of 16, but their run ended there as they faced top competitors from Stanford and Cal, respectively. In the doubles tournament, Olmos and Scandalis paired up and advanced to the quarterfinals before losing to the No. 3-seed pair Lynn Chi and Anett Schutting from Cal.
The tournament was not all positive for the Women of Troy, however, as DeSimone appeared to suffer an injury that could hinder her heading into the NCAA tournament.
“Gabrielle DeSimone pulled her hip on Thursday,” Gallien said. “The doctors say she will be out for a week. As long as she is ready to go for the first round, we should be fine.”
Moreover, there is a natural concern that non-tennis related distractions could add stress on the girls as they enter the most important leg of their season.
“For us, the most important thing is keeping the girls fresh and enthusiastic, while keeping in mind that they, like the rest of the students, are in the midst of finals season,” Gallien said. “The nice thing is if we get out of the first two rounds, we will be done with all of the girls’ finals moving forward.”
The Women of Troy are expected to be one of the top seeds in the NCAA tournament following a splendid regular season. The tournament will kick off May 17 in Urbana, Ill.
The tournament starts earlier with the first two rounds which should be at USC. Gallien’s job should be on the
line this year if not able to reach the final four at least. He has done very little nationally in all his years with the
Women of Troy. He came from Pepperdine like Peter Smith on the men side who won four consecutive ncaa
titles recently.

The USC women’s water polo team has earned the title of 2013 MPSF champion and an automatic bid to the NCAA championship tournament after three decisive wins over the weekend in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament.
Hats off · USC junior two-meter Hannah Buckling led the charge for the Women of Troy in the finals of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament, scoring a game-high four goals in the team’s 11-7 victory. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
In a conference tournament that boasted the top five women’s water polo schools in the nation, the Women of Troy seemed to be lost in a crowd of talented players. Throughout the weekend, however, they rose far above the fray, picking up a 21-5 win against No. 7 seed CSU Bakersfield, an 11-5 victory against No. 3 seed Arizona State and an impressive 11-7 win in the championship game against top-seeded Stanford.
The action began on Friday morning as the Women of Troy suited up to take on the Roadrunners of CSU Bakersfield. The Runners kept it close through the first half but were unable to contain the USC offense or break through its ironclad defense in the second half.
Though the USC defense allowed only one goal in the second half, the story of the day was the team’s offense, which was bolstered by both experienced players and youngsters with limited postseason experience. Three different seniors — driver Chelsea Silvers, driver Dominique Sardo and two-meter Nicolina McCall — scored on the day, as did four players in their first year with the team. One of them, freshman two-meter Jayde Appel, tallied a hat trick.
Other top performers against CSU Bakersfield included junior goalie Flora Bolonyai, who racked up 10 saves; junior two-meter Kaleigh Gilchrist, who led the scoring attack with a 5-goal outing; and sophomore driver Monica Vavic, who also recorded a hat trick.
With her fourth goal of the game, Gilchrist notched career goal No. 100, the second time this season a player has accomplished that feat. She joined sophomore teammate Vavic in reaching that milestone; Vavic hit the century mark in the final game of the regular season.
The win against CSU Bakersfield left USC in a tough semifinal game against No. 3 Arizona State. Though the Women of Troy took both of the teams’ regular season matchups, the Sun Devils were entering the game amid a seven-game winning streak and riding a wave of confidence.
USC swiftly replaced that confidence with despair, however, as the Women of Troy rushed out of the gate with six unanswered goals. All season long, the Trojans have relied on second-half domination and wearing out their opponents, but head coach Jovan Vavic wasn’t necessarily surprised with the early offensive outburst.
“Every game is different,” Jovan Vavic said. “You just don’t know what you’re going to get. Our early shots went in and that gave us confidence. When you score early, you want to shoot more.”
Despite ASU’s best efforts in the second quarter to bring the game within three goals, the Women of Troy pulled well ahead in the second half on goals by Sardo and freshman attacker Anni Espar.
Monica Vavic picked up her second hat trick of the weekend against ASU, and the USC defense clamped down on two 6-on-5 opportunities in the fourth quarter to secure the 11-5 victory.
The semifinal victory put the squad in the finals against Stanford, the No. 1-ranked team in the country and top seed in the tournament. The Cardinal handed USC its first and only loss of the season by a score of 6-4 on April 13 at the Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
“We expected to play [Stanford] in the finals,” Vavic said. “They were the best team and we were looking forward to it. We didn’t play our best last time against them, [but] the girls were fired up and played with energy and excitement.”
It was clear that the Women of Troy were determined to avenge their previous defeat. Monica Vavic and junior two-meter Hannah Buckling opened the scoring with two goals apiece, followed by a well-placed skip shot by junior attacker Kelly Mendoza for the team’s fifth goal.
Stanford senior two-meter Melissa Seidemann posted a hat trick in the second quarter to pull the Cardinal closer, but the Trojan offense kept pace with two goals of its own in the frame. With a 7-3 lead going into halftime, USC never looked back.
Junior Madeline Rosenthal opened the scoring after halftime, followed by strikes from Espar and Buckling. When the final buzzer sounded, Bolonyai had collected 9 saves (including an impressive stop on a 5-meter penalty shot), Vavic had earned her third hat trick of the weekend and the Women of Troy had completed their run to the MPSF crown — their first since 2009.
With the tournament victory, USC earns the MPSF’s automatic bid to the NCAA championships, where Stanford and either ASU or UCLA will likely join them. The tournament win will also likely give the Women of Troy the No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, putting the team in the best position to take home the national championship.
“We will have an easier schedule,” Jovan Vavic said. “Your first game is against the No. 8 seed, which shouldn’t be a problem. Then you will get the No. 4 or 5 seed, and it will be an easier road to the final game.”
This year’s NCAA tournament will be held in Cambridge, Mass., from May 10-12.

“It would be mortifying to the feelings of many ladies, could they be made to understand how little the heart of a man is affected by what is costly or new in their attire. … Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter.”
Word, Jane Austen. Somewhere among the magazine headlines of “Best Summer Hair Now,” “Perfect Date Outfits to Wow Him” and “The Right Cologne to Make Her Tingle,” women and men have become accustomed to the idea of great appearances being tied to happiness. But most importantly, the idea of other people’s approval superseding their own has taken an alarming hold.
If everyone woke up and got dressed to make themselves happy, I have a feeling that we would be seeing a lot more sweatsuit outfits around.
Unfortunately, we are often too frightened of a “nice outfit” statement with a smirk directed in our direction to care about that.
I dress according to how I feel at that moment. If I’m about to spend eight hours editing in the Avid labs in the basement of the School of Cinematic Arts, chances are a pair of leggings and a hoodie will do. Who am I trying to impress? Who am I afraid of seeing? Why would I need makeup if I’m going to be in a dark room all day?
This idea makes perfect sense to me. Me plus no daylight equals comfort dressing. Yet, that doesn’t stop the comments from friends. “I see we didn’t have enough time to put on makeup this morning,” one said. “Don’t you write a fashion column?” another asked.
Why yes. Yes I do. And at night, I love to throw on a pair of heels, get out my signature dark red lipstick and smoky eye makeup and go out for a night on the town. I love to spend an hour on my makeup. I love to go shopping. I love to read magazines and rip out pages for inspiration.
But I refuse to bow down and change the way I dress just because other people want me to. They say when you look good, you feel good — and I do agree with that statement. But I think I agree more with the idea that feeling good comes from actually feeling good — as in comfortable, handsome, beautiful — based on your own accord and not someone else’s. If I’m going to be sitting in the same spot for hours, I want to feel comfortable and not worry about whether or not my eyeliner is running.
A friend of mine recently received the chance to interview with Vogue. Heard of it? Yeah, I haven’t either but apparently they talk about fashion in it or something. This friend is beautiful, charming, funny and smart as hell — and yet she was worried about not being fashionable enough to work there.
Sure, I imagine the Vogue offices as where The Devil Wears Prada comes to life: Girls running around in $1,000 Valentino studded stilettos with J Brand distressed jeans and a Chanel tweed jacket (and those are just the interns). But honestly, if an office doesn’t hire you just because you might not look like Karlie Kloss, then screw them. As long as you like what you’re wearing, then you’re set.
There’s so much more to life than just pleasing other people, a fact that took me some time to realize. I used to pester a certain guy about his outfits: His horrible sunglasses that make it look like he’s about to go snowboarding, the same pair of sneakers in different shades of brown and some ill-fitting graphic T-shirts. I would “hint” that cutting his hair in a short-on-the-sides, longer-on-top style would flatter him, that actual shirts might be the most age-appropriate thing on a 25-year-old and that a different pair of shoes wouldn’t hurt.
His response? “I don’t care.”
What he wears makes him happy. What he wears makes him comfortable. No matter how I want him to dress, I have to respect the fact that he dresses for himself.
So start ignoring all of the hate coming your way. Want to wear all-over prints even though you’re curvy? Go for it. Want to wear sweatpants to your 8 a.m. class? Rock it — I’m from Jersey, where sweatpants are a rite of passage.
Stop worrying about everyone else’s opinion and start worrying about your own. That way, the next time that someone tells you that your dress is cute or that your shoes are fly, it’ll make you even happier to realize that you liked the outfit all along — not after the compliment.

If you’ve never been to Australia, the images conjured by the words “Australian food” are probably limited to two things: Foster’s Beer (Australian for “liquid regret”) and Vegemite (Australian for “disgusting”). What many don’t know is that another, significantly more enjoyable foodstuff enjoys a similar iconic ubiquity in the land down under: the savory meat pie.
Savory · Bronzed Aussies’ owner wants her meat pies part to become an Angeleno fast food staple, seeing as they are convenient for those on the go. – Euno Lee | Daily Trojan
Los Angeles transplant and Australian entrepreneur Samantha Bryan saw an opportunity to bring her native country’s beloved savory pies to Angelenos, so she enlisted the assistance of chef Lincoln Smith in creating Bronzed Aussie, a quick-service savory pie shop that opened earlier this month in Downtown L.A.’s Santee Court.
According to the restaurant’s website, the name “Bronzed Aussie” is inspired by the early volunteer “surf rescue” squads that patrolled the Australian coast. The name pays tribute to the lifeguards who spent their days out under the heat of the Australian sun and developed bronzed skin, hence the name “Bronzed Aussie.”
The pies served at this discreet boutique tucked into an alleyway off Los Angeles Street, however, are more golden brown. The hand-sized pockets carry traditional fillings, such as original ground beef, pepper steak and seafood, as well as some unorthodox offerings, including Thai chicken curry and vegetarian ratatouille, all of which are encased in a buttery, brilliant golden crust.
And the crust is a textural marvel — the top enclosure and edge is crunchy without being excessively flaky or greasy. Removing the pie from the tin will reveal a supple, yet surprisingly substantive pastry on the bottom that manages to hold the savory fillings without falling apart.
The fillings themselves largely fail to live up to their thoughtfully conceived vessels, though that is admittedly a tall order. In fact, pepper steak is a capable complement: Cubes of fork-tender beef, rich gravy and the crust combine to re-create the Australian comfort food.
Other iterations are less successful; The vegetarian ratatouille combines tomatoes, basil, eggplant, bell peppers, onions and zucchini, but  it fails to play up the acidity of the tomatoes to flesh out the flavors of the other vegetables. Instead, the entire filling is completely drowned by the nutty crust.
A similar problem hampers the seafood pie’s flavors from truly taking shape — respectable chunks of fish, shrimp and potato are bathed in a white wine cream sauce with parsley and lemon, but the filling’s comforting richness begs for an acidic contrast against the buttery heft of crust.
If you manage to eat your way into a food coma, Bronzed Aussie also serves Australian roast espresso and other coffee drinks. The beans are provided by Longshot Coffee, the product of Bryan’s fellow Australian-turned-Angeleno Mark Baird.
According to Longshot Coffee’s website, the Australian roast provides a lighter profile than the espressos found in most American coffeeshops.
One of the most notable things about Bronzed Aussie is its convenience as a takeaway option for hungry folks on the go. The open-faced breakfast (or as the Aussies might call it, “brekkie”) pies, traditional savory pies and pastries are freshly baked in batches and ready for immediate take out.
Other menu items include spinach and feta rolls (a kind of Australian spanakopita), french fries and, for the truly homesick Australian, the ever-menacing Vegemite toast.
The location itself is rather hard to find for those who aren’t actively searching for it. This charming hole in the wall peeks out from an alleyway adjacent to the larger Santee Court’s main building. Though the scant indoor seating is limited to a bar against the window, the courtyard is outfitted with plenty of al fresco seating for those who have time to sit down and savor the pies.
Eating there is an especially good idea considering the staff is courteous and enthusiastic, and yes, one gentleman even has a rather strong (and charming) Australian accent.
Bronzed Aussie is certainly onto something: Fast, hearty and handheld are three welcome adjectives in a city that has one hand perpetually cuffed to a steering wheel. Australian transplants and Angelenos who’ve visited the land down under longing for a taste of Australia’s national food will enjoy Bronzed Aussie’s authenticity.
It also warrants a visit, for others if only for the reason that it will provide them an opportunity to taste a take on another culture’s fast food, of which Bronzed Aussie offers a presumed prototype.
Though the pies might not be for everyone, they’re certainly accessible to an American palate. And for those who have their doubts, at least you know going in that it couldn’t possibly be worse than Vegemite.

The refrain “it’s not personal, it’s business” is seemingly everywhere in corporate life. Business students and employees are trained to believe in the importance of the bottom line and that profits, rather than people, are essential to success.
In his new book, Give and Take, organizational psychologist and University of Pennsylvania Wharton professor Adam Grant turns this thinking on its head by declaring that kindness and helpfulness is the missing key to long-term productivity. Though the idea has induced heavy criticism from traditionalists, executives that take the leap to incorporate Grant’s theories could enjoy two very important benefits: increased productivity and enhanced corporate image. In an industry that has suffered tremendously in public opinion, the decision to prioritize philanthropy over profits is worth considering.
As Susan Dominus describes in a profile published in the New York Times, “The greatest untapped source of motivation, [Grant] argues, is a sense of service to others; focusing on the contribution of our work to other people’s lives has the potential to make us more productive than thinking about helping ourselves.”
To incorporate these ideas into the corporate workspace, Grant regularly works with companies like Google and Amazon increase employee productivity and satisfaction. The success of these companies is a compelling point in Grant’s favor. By focusing on increasing employee satisfaction through prioritizing “giving,” a company can produce quality work, as well as keep their employees happy.
This idea has generated criticism from some analysts, but Grant stands by them. As Andrew Offenburger of The Huffington Post argues, “It would appear that [Grant] is packaging charity into micro-loans, of sorts, each with an anticipated return-on-investment.”
But Offenburger claims there might be no such return. In response, Grant asserts that the “big picture” of long-term advancement is more important that short-term returns. He challenges these myths by asserting employee satisfaction and productivity are two sides of the same coin. In emphasizing concern for others, the goal of increasing the motivation to work for others is already accomplished.
Though these ideas may seem idealistic, Grant’s credentials and academic prestige lend a degree of credibility to an otherwise unbelievable idea. At 31, he is the youngest tenured professor at Wharton, holds a Ph.D. of organizational psychology and is consistently a favorite of students. More importantly, he capitalizes on an idea that could transform company image.
Even more compelling is the notion that Grant’s theories help transform the concepts that define corporate thinking. Companies with the mentality that profits take precedence over everything should consider his theories.
As Susan Adams of Forbes argues, “[Grant] does a convincing job of proving that givers can achieve much more than cautious, self-protective takers who ‘believe the world is a competitive, dog-eat-dog place,’ where they need to put themselves first, for fear someone else will elbow them aside.”
In this respect, Grant does much more for business owners than just organizational success: he also gives them perspective.
“Think of it this way,” Grant said in his book. “In corporate America, people do sometimes feel that the work they do isn’t meaningful. And contributing to co-workers can be a substitute for that.”
If nothing else, Grant’s theories provide a refreshing reminder of what is important in life. Finding meaning in life and work is not idealistic, Grant argues. In many cases, it is essential to profits, productivity and success.

Last Tuesday, officials noticed large cracks in the Rana Plaza building in the Bangladeshi suburb of Savar, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. This particular building housed shops, offices and several factories which produced clothing for brands, such as Mango, Primark and Joe Fresh.

These cracks were large enough to be considered dangerous and police quickly evacuated everyone inside of the building, NPR reported. That is, except for the thousands of workers in the five garment factories who occupied the upper-three (illegally-constructed) floors.
As of Monday, the search for survivors was called off in what has been called the deadliest incident in Bangladesh’s garment industry. According to the Huffington Post, the death toll has reached 380 with 900 workers missing somewhere in the rubble.
The tragedy is indescribable: media reports of the screams of those trapped in the building, begging to be ripped from the rubble before a fire broke out and a realization that people died earning $37 a month.
According to the New York Times, Bangladesh’s $20-billion garment industry has boomed in the past decade — second only to China. Retailers, such as H&M, Primark, Joe Fresh, Mango and Walmart, all produce their products in the tiny Asian country.
Last November, a fire killed 112 workers, also in Bangladesh. Afterward, many companies, including Walmart, declared that they would look into worker safety, according to the Times.
No matter how much corporations talk, unless action is taken, the same mistake will happen again. Somewhere between the desire to save a few dollars and the rush to produce garments, corporations have forgotten the importance of basic human needs.
There were many problems that led to Tuesday’s disastrous events. First, the top three floors in which the garment factories were stationed were illegally built, according to NPR. Sohel Rana, the owner of the building, allowed the factory workers to continue with their day even though the rest of the building had been evacuated. And, as Bloomberg reported, Rana was arrested for trying to flee the country a few days after the collapse.
The Rana Plaza is only one of the many factories that didn’t meet legally required standards in a work building. According to Bloomberg, about half of Bangladesh’s garment factories don’t even come close to those regulations.
Owners of these factories, as well as the corporations that hide them, are easy to blame. With billions of dollars behind its name, a company such as Walmart could afford to house its factories in at least decently constructed buildings. And $37 a month? The thought of Americans earning under $20,000 a year is enough to cause a ruckus.
In 2009, the International Labor Rights Forum noticed violations at Walmart factions that included workers being paid up to 30 percent below their country’s minimum wage, pregnant females being denied maternity leave, timed bathroom breaks and lack of overtime payments.
By exploiting the little man, owners of these factories see the big bucks in possessing as many large factories as possible, with little regard to the fact that they are actually employing people — not just money-makers.
Factories should meet basic standards: a safe construction, an organized management system and paychecks that read more like salaries than an American teenager’s allowance. Bangladesh might have safety regulations, but somehow the Rana Plaza’s inspection slipped through the cracks.
The most blame, however, must be placed on us: the consumers. We continue to purchase items that we know are made in sweatshops. We can’t pretend as if we’re not aware of the trials and tribulations suffered by humans around the world. It’s ignorant to ignore the fact that our new shirt or new shoes could have been made by a small child in a dark factory, given pennies as a salary.
It might seem difficult to get involved — not everyone has the time to be a part of something such as the Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation here at ’SC. It is never difficult, however, to take a stand.
Luckily, USC has started to make the transition to guarenteed sweatshop-free apparel, allowing students to rock cardinal and gold without feeling guilty. But in the case of other retailers, it’s important to know where your clothes come from.
The Labor Rights Forum has an online database in which visitors can see which brands currently utilize sweatshops. By boycotting these brands, consumers can let large corporations know that it is not OK to exploit people for the sake of money.
Other websites, such as GreenAmerica.org, give tips on how to find sweatshop-free clothing.
Only by putting the pressure on these corporations can such tragedies be avoided.
