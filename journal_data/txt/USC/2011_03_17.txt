Like it has so many times this season, the USC women’s basketball team responded when its back was against the wall.
Trailing by double digits midway through the second half, the Women of Troy (20-13) rallied to beat UC Santa Barbara 67-64 in the opening round of the Women’s National Invitational Tournament. Junior guard Ashley Corral came off the bench to lead USC with 15 points, including four key three-pointers when her team’s season was in jeopardy.
“This may not have been our final goal but we’re here to play and win,” Corral said. “Any postseason tournament is another chance to play with your team and play for what you’re about.”
Whether it was disappointment over missing the NCAA tournament for the second year in a row or a pesky UCSB squad, USC seemed to be in a lull for much of the first half. 
The Women of Troy led by as many as six points in the half before the Gauchos made their charge.
Sparked by its bench, UCSB closed the first half on a 22-12 run and took a 38-34 lead into halftime. 
Back-to-back three-pointers by Corral in the closing minutes of the half kept the margin from being even greater.
Reserve players Nicole Nesbit, Sweets Underwood and Melissa Zornig combined for 25 points on 11-of-17 shooting in the half for UCSB.  
The Gauchos outscored USC’s bench 25-13 in the first half.
That momentum carried over into the second half, with the Gauchos taking on the role of aggressor. 
UCSB landed a proverbial punch in the mouth to open the second half, quickly expanding its lead to double digits. 
Every dead ball and timeout was punctuated by cheers from the UCSB players and fans.
USC, by contrast, looked dead in the water.
But the Women of Troy — buoyed at times by Corral’s intensity and timely shooting — responded and summoned the energy for one last gasp. 
USC chipped away at the lead behind the playmaking of Corral and senior guard Jacki Gemelos.  
With seven minutes left, the Women of Troy made their move.
“There was a point where everybody was exhausted,” said junior guard Briana Gilbreath. “[But] because of how hard we practice we had another level.  We [picked] up our intensity on defense. The [end of the game] is where we really took over and stepped up as a team.”
Four points apiece by Gilbreath and Gemelos helped the Women of Troy break open a 57-57 game. Lockdown defense by the entire team helped USC preserve the victory as the Gauchos scored just four points in the final six-and-a-half minutes of the game.
The Women of Troy forced the Gauchos into a bad shot on what should have been their final possession of the game, but a turnover by Corral during the ensuing scramble gave UCSB one last chance.
UCSB guard Emilie Johnson, who led the Gauchos with 17 points, threw up a desperation heave at the buzzer that fell well short, allowing the Women of Troy to escape the opening round with a three-point victory.
“The key was playing score and time,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “We didn’t want them to score three, so I thought our defense was excellent, and we did what we had to do.”
Gemelos and Gilbreath both added 13 points for the Women of Troy. Gemelos just missed out on a double-double with a team-high nine rebounds.
USC moves on to a second-round game on Sunday at 2 p.m. against Nevada.

Known for signing up-and-coming alternative rock groups, Fueled By Ramen’s latest addition to the label wasn’t predictable.
After reforming in 2009, Sublime with Rome has officially become a part of the FBR family, which includes bands Panic! at the Disco, Paramore, Travie McCoy, Fun. and many more.
Rome (guitar/vocals) and the founding members of the legendary alternative/ska-punk band, Bud Gaugh (drums) and Eric Wilson (bass), are hoping to release a new album this summer. At the moment, they are recording for the highly-anticipated album at Sonic Ranch in El Paso, Texas.
“We can’t wait for the fans to hear it, and are already planning a world tour to bring it to them live,” said Rome on the band’s website. A North American tour is expected to be announced in the near future as well.
The band doesn’t intend for its new music to come off as replacing the deceased guitarist/vocalist Bradley Nowell. Instead, the band wants to celebrate the past and what is in store for the future.
Fans won’t have to wait too much longer to hear what they’ve been working on. This spring, the first single will be aired on the radio.
Sublime with Rome has also announced that it will be streaming live from the studio this Monday at 6pm. By accessing the stream through the band’s Facebook page, die-hard fans can get an inside look on the progress they have made during the recording process.

Small amounts of radioactive particles will reach the coast of California as soon as Friday, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Although experts say that the amounts of radiation is minimal based on original projections by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, they also say the levels that were originally projected are predicted to grow because radioactive emissions have grown since the earthquake that hit Japan on March 11.
No exact numbers have been released regarding the amount of radiation released by the earthquake from the Fukushima nuclear facility.
For more coverage on the devastation in Japan, click here.
How is USC going to be respond to its students worrying about the radiation in the air that we breathe? I am certainly concerned about how safe it is to even stay in LA for now. I’m surprised at how little USC has covered in regards to this Japanese tragedy which has affected all parts of the world, especially in the Pacific Ocean. I hope once Spring Break ends, the school will be able to prepare a proper response to its students and their families.

A year ago, USC coach Michael Cooper declined a chance to have the USC women’s basketball team play in the WNIT after finishing the season 19-12.
But this year, after his team was once again left out of the NCAA field with the same record, Cooper decided to accept a bid to the postseason tournament.
“I think it’ll serve us right this year,” Cooper said. “Obviously, the [NCAA tournament] is what we wanted to be in, but [the WNIT] will give us a chance to play together more as a team … We’ll use this as a springboard to hopefully get us going for next year.”
The Women of Troy, appearing in the WNIT for the first time since 2002, will try to start a run through the tournament on their home court tonight against the Gauchos. 
Despite the disappointment of being denied the chance to play in the NCAA tournament two years in a row, the players are maintaining a positive mindset.
“Coming that close to making the NCAA tournament is a bummer,” said sophomore forward Christina Marinacci. “It’s going to be hard to get over that. But my mindset is … [to try] and win the whole thing, and show the committee that we deserved to play in the NCAA’s.”
The Gauchos (19-11), regular season champions of the Big West conference, enter the WNIT after being upset by Pacific University 49-45 in the first round of the Big West tournament.
UCSB is led in scoring by junior guard Emilie Johnson with 13.6 points per game. The Gauchos also have senior center Mekia Valentine, a University of Wake Forest transfer who averages a double-double with 11.1 points and 11.0 rebounds per game.
USC is 11-13 all-time against UCSB, with its last matchup coming in November 2008 that resulted in a 62-53 win.
If the Women of Troy defeat the Gauchos, they could face a couple familiar conference rivals that could act as roadblocks in the team’s march towards a WNIT championship. 
Arizona, who holds a 2-1 edge over USC this season, could face off against the Women of Troy as early as the third round.
Defending WNIT champion California awaits the Women of Troy following that game in the quarterfinals. The teams split their two matchups this season, each winning on their own home court.
Tonight’s game marks the fifth straight game that USC will have played at the Galen Center, where the team went 12-4 during the regular season and Pac-10 tournament.
Tip-off is at 7 p.m.
