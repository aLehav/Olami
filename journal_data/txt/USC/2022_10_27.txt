Vanessa Gomez Brake, the associate dean of religious life at USC, is the first humanist chaplain to be a chief religious and spiritual leader at a United States university.
In her position, Gomez Brake provides oversight for all religious and spiritual offerings on campus. She describes her title as a humanist chaplain to mean seeing the world as an opportunity to bring about “good in our lives” and in others. 
According to Dean of Religious Life Varun Soni, about 50% of the student body is not affiliated with a religion, and Gomez Brake works to spread the message that a spiritual life is something any Trojan can have, regardless of religious affiliation. 
She prioritizes bringing together a community and connection to USC through an array of religious and spiritual student organizations. Gomez Brake oversees more than 90 student religious groups and 50 religious directors, and advises Trojans through programs such as the Interfaith Council and Secular Student Fellowship, a gathering of secular students including atheists, agnostics, humanists and others. 
Gomez Brake animates a community that shares the same core as religion without holding supernatural beliefs, with its main goal being to encourage good within oneself and to others. Every other Sunday, the group holds a vegan dinner at the University Religious Center in Room 108.
“There’s a bit of ritual [in SSF] because we make sure to have a meaningful connection, but then we eat together, and then we close the night by singing together,” Gomez Brake said. “Every human being needs that connection, community and ritual.“
Stephen Kim, the student leader in the Interfaith Council and a junior majoring in religious studies, said his experience working with Gomez Brake is “like having a dear friend, who is at times a fresh stranger whom you share an inside joke with.” 
“[Gomez Brake] always gives you the exact right amount of space you need to fully be yourself, to explore whatever you want to,” Kim said. 
Gomez Brake also works to create communities that reach beyond religious and spiritual organizations. In 2017, former President Donald Trump worked toward rescinding Deferred Action for Children Arrivals, restricting access to education for undocumented students. Though it was not in her job portfolio, Gomez Brake also led a community for undocumented Trojans to inform them of the resources USC had to offer Dreamers.
“If you’ve been accepted into this school, you are a Trojan no matter what your [citizenship] status is,” Gomez Brake said.
As a chaplain, Gomez Brake is a confidential counselor — meaning the mentorship that she offers students is strictly between her and them. She provided many Trojan Dreamers a safe, private space, and offers the same service to all students. 
Gomez Brake said she “wanted undocumented students to make sure that they felt welcome, … like they belong, like this school is for them.”
“She has a lightness to her that’s just very human,” Kim said.
Varun Soni described Gomez Brake as not only a historic hire, but also a “pioneer and trailblazer.” 
“[Gomez Brake] represents the future because of how creative she is with the way she brings people together for ritual and community through the different programs,” Soni said. “Anyone who goes to see her will really feel welcomed.”
Prior to her associate dean position at USC, Gomez Brake worked at the Office of Religious Life at Stanford University. There, she worked closely with student-led religious groups and led campus programming of her own. At Stanford, Gomez Brake said the Stanford Memorial Church sitting in the center of campus served as an emblem for the Christian institution. Contrarily, USC doesn’t have a church at the center of its campus, which Gomez Brake said allows for “a lot of freedom to engage in religion and spirituality on this campus.” 
“Here at USC, you actually see a wide spectrum of religious practice on campus as opposed to just one,” she said. “That’s been my biggest learning [experience] in terms of being a chaplain on this campus, just being flexible enough to support everyone.”
One of the ways Gomez Brake connects with her interfaith outside of her work is through Filipino folk dancing. Prior to living in Los Angeles, she resided in the Bay Area, where she instantly found her community through folk dancing. Through her performance, Gomez Brake found herself enriching not only her bodily health but her spiritual health as well. Having performed in the White House and doing international tours, Gomez discovered the necessity for community and applied that lesson to her role as chaplain. 
“You’re not just looking for your own community, you’re looking for a larger community no matter what their background is, no matter what they need,” Soni said. “[Gomez Brake] seems to exemplify that better than anyone I know.” 
Gomez Brake continues to prioritize community here at USC. Her chaplaincy calls to bring together a group of people and unite them. She calls forward any Trojan, regardless of one’s spiritual and/or religious background. Her center of community at USC resides at the University Religious Center, a place where students can “just be their authentic selves.”
The University Religious Center is located between the Student Health Center an d the United House of Prayer. Gomez encourages all walks of life into this space. 
“Everyone has a reason to come to the University Religious Center,” she said.

Through the International Teaching English as a Foreign Language  Academy, some USC students are taking the initiative to move beyond campus and gain real-world international experience.  
The International TEFL Academy is a leader in TEFL certification and a resource for those interested in gaining experience abroad as English teachers, an opportunity that enables people of any background to better access the global economy. John Bentley, co-founder of ITA , explained that this opportunity was one that the organization specifically hoped to encourage other people to pursue when it opened in 2010. 
“It means that for those of us who are native English speakers, there are literally hundreds of thousands of opportunities to go work abroad as an English teacher,” Bentley said. 
After growing up in Cairo, Egypt, and spending time writing travel content, Bentley said he understands the importance of cultural exchange. Bentley and the ITA work to give people those same opportunities, offering a variety of classes both virtually and in person designed to complement the schedules of those with full-time jobs or course loads. 
Patrick Dowd, a 2022 Rossier School of Education graduate, had always wanted to spend time abroad like his siblings and, on a whim, stopped by the ITA building on his way home from work one day. He found himself enrolled in the virtual course and soon after that he headed to Southeast Asia.  
“It was the best experience of my life,” he said. “I went with my TEFL certification, but I didn’t go with a job lined up. And so I traveled for six to seven weeks beforehand all throughout Southeast Asia to kind of see where I wanted to live and to see what made the most sense. I found Chiang Mai, [Thailand], it was the last place that I went to, and I fell in love with it and then I went from there.”  
Dowd’s time abroad challenged his independence, encouraged perseverance, and ultimately provided a sense of euphoria, qualities which are exactly what Bentley champions. Dowd credits his time abroad as a stepping stone toward his master’s degree here at USC.  
“I was applying to grad schools while I was there and I had been accepted to USC in January 2020, so like right before the pandemic, and I really feel as though if it wasn’t for that experience, like; that really gave me the confidence to even be able to apply to USC,” Dowd said.  
Beyond instilling personal confidence, the ITA gives its alumni confidence in their instructing abilities. They prepare their students to be adaptable — enabling them to excel whether instructing children or adults. 
“A TEFL certification course is going to provide you with the skills to be able to walk into a classroom in let’s say, Madrid, or Tokyo or Istanbul and be able to provide a quality [educational] experience to people who want to learn English,” Bentley said. 
Since its founding in 2010, the ITA has certified more than 40,000 English teachers. 
Gerardo Pesqueira, a freshman majoring in human biology, is already set on spending time abroad. He discovered the program through a friend and his interest was piqued after more research. As a first-generation Mexican American, Pesqueira is no stranger to language learning, and as a previous after-school program volunteer, teaching is something he has enjoyed.
“I’ve been bilingual my whole life and I’ve seen firsthand how much power it has to be able to speak two languages and communicate with people from different countries,” Pesqueira said.  
He, like other Trojans before him, is hoping to take advantage of ITA and other programs to spend time abroad. As many have learned, teaching English abroad is an experience that provides a unique sense of freedom.
“There just is such a freeing experience with doing something like that,” Dowd said. “You’re doing it for yourself and, your mom or your dad or your brothers — no one’s really with you doing that and to me, nobody could ever take that away from you.”

It might not take much effort to remember the dystopian renaissance that occurred circa 2010s, during which Veronica Roth’s “Divergent” joined “The Hunger Games” and “The Maze Runner” in redefining the young adult literary landscape. In Roth’s latest novel, “Poster Girl,” she poses the question of what happens after a dystopian regime collapses. 
Having been the “Poster Girl” and “a symbol of the Delegation,” Sonya Kantor is banished to the Aperture, a dilapidated, prison-like complex for fellow loyalists to the previous government. Kantor lost her family, friends and betrothed during the uprising that led to the Triumvirate and exists in a state of perpetual longing for the near past. During the days of the Delegation, technology was limitless and the Insight, a device embedded in the eye from birth, gamified life through credits known as DesCoin. In the present, the blue circle around Kantor’s eye, rendered useless after its deactivation, serves merely as a reminder of all she has lost. 
Kantor’s battle with the past and present is made more apparent through Roth’s worldbuilding by separating the Aperture as a place with Insights, tattered clothing, rats scurrying across the concrete and walls etched with the names of lost loved ones. After Kantor is recruited to solve the mystery of a girl taken from her family by the Delegation in exchange for her freedom, Roth introduces the world of the Triumvirate, which looks eerily like our own. 
In the outside world, Kantor stands out as people gawk at her Insight and squint at her familiar face, one that used to be plastered on every wall with the slogan, “What’s right is right.” The Triumvirate has traded in the Insight for the Elicit, a glowing, handheld device that bears a stark resemblance to a phone. The trading of technology, one name for another, begs the question of whether they are all the same, inherently controlling and invasive, which brings the Triumvirate’s antagonist, The Analog Army, to the forefront of the story. They argue that the desire to “sacrifice autonomy and privacy for convenience” will be the population’s downfall. 
Though the plot of “Poster Girl” is driven forward by the mystery of Grace Ward’s whereabouts. Kantor’s existence between two worlds is the most compelling aspect of the novel. Her perspective of the Delegation, the Triumvirate and her place in the world shifts as monumental events occur throughout the story. Kantor’s journey to finally unlearn the person she was during the Delegation, while also taking responsibility for her actions, makes her a protagonist worth exploring even further. Though the novel closes on a seemingly conclusive note, its anticlimactic ending can be traced to the unfinished development of Kantor’s character, an incomplete examination of the Triumvirate and the Delegation, as well as a romantic subplot that is left up in the air. 
The Delegation is described through Kantor’s memories and exists in remnants within the ashes of the Aperture. As a result, the past world can be visualized, but only within the context of Kantor and her experiences. This incomplete image makes it difficult to differentiate between the ideologies of the new world founded by the Triumvirate. Both regimes value technology, albeit in different ways. However, there is not enough information about the Triumvirate to truly decide whether or not it is better or worse than the Delegation. 
It is possible that the lack of details is meant to demonstrate the slippery slope of technology and the government, but the novel, running only 288 pages long, is wounded by the omission of clarity pertaining to the Triumvirate. Questions about the motivations of the government overtake the weight of Kantor’s mission, as well as overshadow her characterization. Though Kantor makes for an interesting protagonist, her identity is inherently tethered to both the Delegation and the Triumvirate. By not expanding upon the intricacies of these regimes, a disservice is done to the development of her complexity as a character. 
The inability to fully understand Kantor makes it difficult to sympathize with the romance between her and Alexander Price. The addition of romance was surely meant to add another layer of intrigue to the story, but instead falls flat, not only because of Kantor’s flawed characterization, but also because of her partner’s imperfection in that department as well. It is ironic then that, despite Kantor’s character being insufficiently expanded upon, she remains the most complex character in the entirety of the novel. 
The premise of “Poster Girl” promises an allegory of our world, a cautionary tale about technology and a mystery that is compelling from start to finish. It succeeds in professing the dangers of the modern world but at the same time, fails to create a memorable story as a result of a cast of characters that struggle to take command of the narrative. The worldbuilding establishes lovely visuals, but beyond that, the novel struggles to elaborate upon the past and present in order to elevate the events and dramatics of the story. 
“Poster Girl” is an enjoyable, short read, but lacks the depth that many might be yearning for. The novel comes to a neat close, but questions that should have been answered throughout the story remain long after the book has been shelved away. But, it doesn’t seem as if “Poster Girl” was meant to end on a cliffhanger, but rather as if the story was deemed complete — even as the loose ends are blaringly apparent. As a novel, “Poster Girl” has potential, but its gaps and shortcomings make it to be a three-star read.

What a month it’s been for Philadelphia sports. The Phillies are in the World Series, the Philadelphia Union are in the Conference Finals, the Eagles are steamrolling the National Football Conference and the Sixers are, well, the Sixers. I wanted to get a window into how the fans are feeling in these exhilarating times, so I spoke with Philadelphia native Sam Nadol, a junior at USC majoring in business administration. 
On the sports scene as a whole in Philadelphia, Nadol said he felt “ecstatic, but also a little sad that [he’s] missing it.” 
Fans like Nadol have played a key role in recent postseason runs for their teams, with superstar outfielder Bryce Harper talking about them in his postgame interview Sunday.
“Unless you’re wearing Philly red or you’re a Phillie, they don’t like you. I love that. I love every emotion that they have,” Harper said. “I did it as an opposing player for a long time and I wanted that. I wanted that emotion from the fans.”
But it’s been much more than the fans pushing their teams forward, as Harper himself has been spectacular. As probably the most touted prospect since LeBron (with a matching Sports Illustrated cover to boot), Harper has faced his share of detractors on the way to his first major postseason success. His critics might’ve had a point before this year’s playoffs; Harper hadn’t won a single playoff series, and the team that drafted him won a World Series title the year after he left. But with a single swing of his bat Sunday night, the Phillies outfielder erased those years of pain, clinching the pennant with a deep drive that landed just over the left wall. Is he ready to take his team to the promised land? Nadol certainly thinks so, “He’s the hottest player in baseball right now.”
Speaking of hot teams, the Eagles will come back from their bye this week sitting pretty atop the NFC at 6-0. Quarterback Jalen Hurts has benefitted from a revamped receiving core, with veteran wide receiver A.J. Brown arriving by trade to complement a strong sophomore start from DeVonta Smith. A resurgent run game led by Miles Sanders has moved the chains well, giving Hurts an opportunity to air the ball out on single coverage routes downfield. 
The Eagles haven’t just been elite on one side of the ball, with a top five ranking for total yards of offense and yards allowed. Their turnover difference is the best in the league by a country mile, as 9 interceptions and 5 fumble recoveries to just 2 offensive interceptions, putting them at +12. The league’s second-highest difference is held by the Dallas Cowboys, who sit 6 turnovers back from the domineering Eagles. 
With elite marks on offense and defense, the Eagles are “favorites to come out of the NFC right now,” Nadol said. Two of the teams predicted to stand in their way before the season, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Green Bay Packers, haven’t looked like serious contenders all year. The Buccaneers in particular looked woeful in a loss to a Panthers team that had just traded the bulk of their offense to the 49ers in the form of star running back Christian McCaffrey.
Unfortunately for Philly fans, it hasn’t all been sunshine and rainbows for their major sports teams. The Philadelphia 76ers tipped off their season last Wednesday against the Toronto Raptors and have looked ice-cold since. It’s a concerning development for a team that has legitimate championship aspirations this season. 
A 1-3 start isn’t the end of the world, but the Sixers were hoping their offseason additions would take them to the next level. They traded for USC alum De’Anthony Melton and added P.J. Tucker to get younger and shore up the defense, respectively. They haven’t fully bedded into the team yet, with Nadol saying the team is giving Melton “too many ball-handling responsibilities” so far.
Still, the Sixers have too much talent to be this bad. Some fans have suggested Head Coach Doc Rivers is mishandling this roster, and Nadol floated Sixers assistant coach Sam Cassell as a potential replacement. Regardless of who’s on the bench for the rest of the season, you’d have to believe a team with the most dominant post player in the world today surrounded by sharpshooters has the potential to be great. If not, maybe they should look at trading a few of those outside shooters to the Los Angeles Lakers. They could use them.

The Trojans look to pick up their ninth conference win of the season in Utah Friday. The game against the Utes will be the team’s third consecutive away game, following matches at University of California, Berkeley and Stanford. 
Despite earning 28 kills, the Trojans dropped all three sets with 11 errors at Maples Pavillion last Sunday. Stanford’s ninth win led them to the number one spot in the Pac-12 standings, with USC following closely behind with 8  conference wins. The loss at Stanford ended the Trojans’ seven-game winning streak, their longest since 2016. 
In response to the loss, Head Coach Brad Keller sent his team a video called “How to Stop Holding Yourself Back” by Simon Sinek. 
“If you focus on the negative, you start working on the negative or the obstructions versus what [we are] actually trying to do,” Keller said in an interview with the Daily Trojan on what message he aimed to deliver through the video. “The message is about learning from the loss of Stanford to help us prepare for what the actual mission or journey or vision or whatever it needs to be.”
The Trojans aim to shift momentum back in their favor for the upcoming game in Utah. Senior opposite hitter Emilia Weske is coming off of a big performance at Cal with a career-high 20 kills that helped bring home the win. 
Senior outside hitter Skylar Fields will also be a player to watch in the upcoming matchup after collecting 31 kills over the past two games. Fields was nominated as Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Week. 
“Everyone wants to talk about the number, but it’s her personality, who she is, the attitude she brings on the court and the swagger that we need at this program,” Keller said. 
With 15 kills and 3 blocks to her name in the Cal game, freshman outside hitter Jordan Wilson is another lethal component of the Trojan squad. 
“Utah is going to be way better than how they were before, and I’m really excited to play them again because I know they’re going to play a lot harder to try and beat us because we beat them,” Wilson said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Utah is currently ranked seventh in Pac-12 standings with a 5-5 conference record. While Utah hasn’t dominated the conference to the same extent as USC, the Utes are coming off of a big win against Oregon State where they swept the Beavers 3-0. 
While this is the first time this season that the Trojans will travel to the Jon M. Huntsman Center, it is not their first matchup against Utah. The Trojans faced the Utes at Galen Center Oct. 2 and won the match in four sets. In that game, fifth-year outside hitter Madelyn Robinson boasted a strong performance with 23 kills and 7 digs. Since then, Robinson has added 100 kills to her stat sheet and will be a player to watch in the upcoming matchup. 
“Utah is a good team. Honestly, all that we can really do is just prepare because we know that, not just them, but every single team, even though we played them before the first time doesn’t mean they haven’t gotten better,” Wilson said. 
Utah senior setter Emily Smith will also be a threat to the Trojans as she tallied up 35 assists in their last matchup at Galen Center. 
Although the upcoming matchup will be played away in Salt Lake City, Trojan fans can still follow the game on the Pac-12 Network as the team continues to fight for wins this season.
“I will always bet on this team,” Keller said. “I will go to war with this team anytime, anyplace, anywhere.”
The match between the Utes and the Trojans will begin at 5 p.m. Friday.
Correction: A previous version of this story credited a different photographer for the image. The photographer is actually Tomoki Chien. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

In a city as vast as Los Angeles, it’s easy to feel alone. When I moved here in August, I felt like  everything was too big and impersonal, and I longed for connection and community. 
One Saturday, I took the Metro Expo line to 7th Street, walked to the Los Angeles Central Library and checked out the “Something in Common” exhibit. The space felt charged with curiosity, creativity and so many stories. Suddenly the city started to feel a little smaller, a little more manageable. 
“Something in Common” highlights 10 L.A.-based interest groups, ranging from the Cloud Appreciation Society to the Roller Pigeon Club. Each organization defines community differently, whether that be through group scuba diving trips for the L.A. Black Underwater Explorers or a shared appreciation for the smallest parts of our universe by the Microscopical Society of Southern California. 
After Microscopical Society member Robert Forrester passed, his son-in-law John Schneider and granddaughter Erin Schneider created a musical rendition of Robert’s original “Fantasies in Crystal” microscope slideshow, which plays in the background. The score consists of a pump organ and adapted viola, giving the space an eager energy.
Exhibit curator Todd Lerew started the project to emphasize how the library fosters a sense of belonging and how we as humans find community. While Lerew started his research pre-pandemic, he said coronavirus heightened our need for connection.
“Before the pandemic, we already knew that it was worthwhile to highlight the library as a gathering place and all of these unique communities and little worlds that make up Los Angeles,” said Lerew, who serves as the director of special projects for the Library Foundation of Los Angeles. “When the pandemic hit, that loneliness became front page news and something we’re all experiencing in some way. I think we’re still trying to figure out how to come back together again and what community looks like.”
In the spirit of community, the exhibit is largely interactive. Visitors can find new recipes in “Desserticide, aka Desserts Worth Dying For,” from the L.A. Community Cookbook Archive. They can also attempt to solve the L.A. Breakfast Club’s traditional cryptogram, a puzzle dating back to the 1930s. 
One of the most powerful parts of “Something in Common” is a guestbook in the middle of the room that invites visitors to answer, “Where do you find your people? What connects you to others?” Pages are filled with guests who find their community at concerts, museums, grocery stores, movie theaters and skate parks; however, there are also entries that admit to feeling isolated and without community. 
Lerew wanted the guestbook to open a dialogue about where visitors feel a sense of belonging or struggle to find those connections.
“Los Angeles can be a very isolating city to live in. We’re all in our cars and everyone’s so busy and spread out,” Lerew said. “These are cliches, but there’s some truth to it. People who have newly arrived have yet to find a community that they can call their own. It can be sad, but I think having that outlet and knowing that there’s a space and a public conversation around that can be helpful.”
Despite the exhibit’s inspiration from serious subject matters like loneliness and depression during the pandemic, “Something in Common” is anything but somber. Text floats in overlapping cloud shapes, often painted in bright oranges, purples and blues. Christine Wong Yap’s “Belonging” banners include quotes from library club members expressing their gratitude and joy. And of course, the San Diego chicken mascot costume, on display from the Baseball Reliquary, is hard not to smile at. 
One of Lerew’s goals was to feature “interesting and underrepresented” communities in L.A., including the Feminist Center for Creative Work. 
“It felt very affirming to have [FCCW] seen as an active community that was present and showing up regularly,” FCCW executive director Sarah Williams said. “Often, arts organizations don’t have that sort of visibility, and I think that’s something that we’ve really worked hard to foster.”
The open layout of the exhibit also helps visitors visualize how communities are fluid and evolving. We can all be part of something bigger, whether we think of it as a formal organization or just a place to hang out with people who share our hobbies or beliefs. The importance is intentionality and a bit of optimism.
Seeing the exhibit inspired me to build my community a little more every day. I met a girl at the New Student Convocation while we were both searching for the Annenberg banner, and now we get groceries and boba together (always fruit-flavored drinks because neither of us like milk tea). I sat down with a really sweet transfer student during the Wednesday  Trojan Farmers Market, and it turned out we both went on a maritime field trip to Dana Point Harbor in the fifth grade. My Spanish 3 partner and I talk about music and movies between conjugations (and I’m excited to hear his “Midnights” review tomorrow). Connecting with other people takes time, but if there’s one thing I learned at the library, it’s that we’ve all got something in common.
“Something in Common” is on display until Nov. 6 at the L.A. Central Library.

The colors of October aren’t orange, yellow and red. No, this month is painted in the pinks of blushing cheeks. In fact, Halloween is the year’s most romantic holiday. What’s better than drawing close during a chilly walk through a haunted house or a late night showing of “The Blair Witch Project” (1999)?  Sharp pumpkin-carving knives may not sound romantic, but a strong connection can come from being frightened by each other’s devilish designs. If it’s all done in coordinated costumes, then the stage has been set and there’s no sense waiting until February. Put down the knives and lean in.
No matter what weekend, the City of Angels offers an endless supply of fun activities that make sitting at home impossible. The upcoming ghostly holiday brings out the best in the city already known for its entertainment, providing USC students with many can’t-miss options for the weekend. Grab your significant other, class crush, situationship or best friend and hit the town. Impress them with one of these fall dates that’ll have them calling their best friend from home to gush.
Rooftop Cinema Club
With a full schedule of Halloween-themed movie screenings this weekend in Downtown L.A., the Arts District and El Segundo, the Rooftop Cinema Club leaps to mind first. Personal headphones, comfortable deckchairs and a full menu of delicious treats that satisfy both sweet and savory cravings are all at the disposal of moviegoers. This weekend’s screenings include, but aren’t limited to: “Ghostbusters” (1984), “The Rocky Horror Picture Show” (1975), “The Mummy” (1999) and “Hocus Pocus” (1993). Bring a blanket and cozy up for a night you’ll both count as one of the year’s highlights. Tickets start at a low $19.50. 
Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights
If you’ve got a Halloween fanatic on your hands and don’t mind a pricier ticket, this might be the perfect choice. Universal Studios’ Halloween Horror Nights offers an especially thrilling experience with eight different haunted houses, a “Terror Tram” and three “Scare Zones” filled with actors in costume ready to send you directly into your partner’s arms. The event is open this weekend from 7 p.m. to 2 a.m, so make sure you don’t have any early morning meetings to wake up for. 
Witches Houses 3 Trail
If you’ve got a car, this outing is free (minus the gas). Friends of Residential Treasures: Los Angeles has released its third downloadable travel guide to the haunted houses of L.A. Take a drive around to spot these eerie residences and look for any flickering lights or fluttering shutters. Though you can’t enter the houses, the unsettling residences will frighten you just fine. Complete the night with a Stephen King audiobook and you’ve got the perfect Halloween drive. 
Nights of the Jack 
This Calabasas night can be thought of as the Halloween version of a Christmas light show. The nearly mile-long trail is electrified by Halloween light installations and festive jack-o’lanterns. Food trucks, professional pumpkin carvers and a “Spookeasy’’ can all be found at the end of the trail. Make sure to take more than a few pictures of the Halloween spectacular and don’t be afraid to grab your partner’s hand on the trail.
Escape Room
Teamwork lies at the foundation of every friendship and relationship. An escape room is guaranteed to strengthen your communication skills while also offering a funny memory. Work with your partner to put together a dream team who can communicate well together and face the clock. Horror Escape LA is 10 minutes away from campus and features plenty of thrilling rooms. Rooms like “Zombie Lab,” “Doctor’s Office” and “Captive Chamber” make choosing hard, but you’ll definitely have a  memorable night of close quarters.
Staying In
If a Halloween themed night-in is calling your name, take the call. Cue up your favorite Halloween movies, gather the sweetest pumpkin flavored treats from Trader Joe’s, grab your person and have a wonderful night with no traffic. Or, get crafty and carve or paint a pumpkin while playing a Halloween playlist. Want to eat your artwork? Stop by Trader Joe’s to pick up their “Haunted House Chocolate Cookie Kit” to put a ghoulish spin on gingerbread houses. 
Planning can be the hardest part of a great date, but something on this list will definitely put you in the spooky mood. The next move is easy: Take a deep breath, ask out the cutie from Latin class and book a ticket to one of these memorable outings. Oct. 31 has the same cupid’s bow that Feb. 14 does.

While the days of excitedly talking about potential costumes and begging your parents for an impromptu trip to Spirit Halloween feel long gone, the essence and fun of Halloween can still live on. Just because throwing on some cat ears or a witch’s hat suffices at a party or event on a college campus, it removes the imaginative quality that felt so integral to Halloween during our youth. But I challenge you to tap back into that state of child-like amusement, excitement and wonder. 
During adolescence, there is a distinct shift in how we are told approach Halloween that permeates into late-teen years as well as young adulthood. I’m talking about the statements that involve things along the lines of “Aren’t you a little old to be trick-or-treating?,” “Halloween is for little kids” or even “Dressing up is lame.”
The media has also played a significant role in skewing our perceptions of Halloween as we get older. Fun, spooky and whimsical has been replaced with sexy, scandalous and simple. Think “Mean Girls” (2004) and the infamous quote: “In girl world, Halloween is the one day a year when a girl can dress like a total slut and no other girls can say anything else about it.”  
Now, I am by no means scolding the inevitable sexy costume shift that comes in college. After all, it is a staple. However, the minimalist costume agenda has plagued and clouded the pleasure that comes from the ability to become literally whatever or whoever you want to be for the night. When else do you get an opportunity like this? Halloween is the perfect time to transform and let your creativity and humor shine. 
Novelist,  memoirist and journalist for  The New York Times Karen Karbo details how Halloween’s whimsy and oddity — even extortionist tendencies — should be embraced, not stifled. She writes that “Halloween should be a little weird and unnerving,” followed by an anecdote of when her 13-year-old daughter was a vampire IRS agent one year. 
I couldn’t agree more. Make all the strange combinations you want, embrace your extremely niche interests or finally become the physical embodiment of your favorite character. Who cares that people may not know who or what you are? Take full advantage of the free reign that only Halloween permits!
Okay, so you’re reinvigorated with Halloween spirit. You’re ready to seize the weekend and relive the glory days of dressing up … where do you start?
Revamping childhood cartoons is my personal favorite genre of Halloween group costumes. They feel nostalgic, full-circle and are oftentimes easy to execute. Characters from “Codename: Kids Next Door” are great options (think of recreating the iconic poses on the logo!), so are Ed, Edd n Eddy as well as the Rugrats. Getting a group together dressed as your favorite “Total Drama Island” characters guarantee an amusing night, especially considering the show has been renewed for another season. Alvin and the Chipmunks, along with the Chipettes, could make really cute groups, and/or couples costumes as well.  
Iconic moments in celebrity and popular culture are shoo-ins for funny, conversation-starting costumes. Dressing as the Malibu Barbie doll in honor of Trisha Paytas’ daughter would be legendary. Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie’s recreation of Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” painting for their show “The Simple Life” is also a great option — a pitchfork and toy chihuahua are absolutely necessary. Some other options include the Jersey Shore cast, Fergie singing the National Anthem, Wendy Williams as the Statue of Liberty, Kanye West and Taylor Swift and honestly, any Madonna or Lady Gaga moment.  
Take a spin on classic costumes by specifying them. Don’t just be a pirate, be a pirate thief covered in thrifted jewelry. Black cat is out, the Cat in the Hat is in. Zombies are cool, but how about zombifying deceased celebrities like Marilyn Monroe or Michael Jackson? Meticulous productions like runways, drag and theater are also great sources of inspiration for more avant garde, eccentric costumes. 
Whatever you end up being, the most important thing is to feel comfortable. It should be common sense by now to avoid costumes that incite hate, are culturally appropriative or are intentionally insensitive. I’m not going to waste my breath on what constitutes a problematic costume, but if you need a reminder, BuzzFeed staff writer Simrin Singh has it covered. Try to keep in mind that Halloween is for everyone. 
While society has placed an age-limit on trick-or-treating, that doesn’t mean we are limited to looking hot and going to a party. Have fun and be creative! Maybe try and heal your inner child by setting up your own trick-or-treating extravaganza by going to your friends’ place. Who are they to judge? 
Halloween isn’t just the “one day a year where a girl can dress like a total slut,” nor is it about the candy — it’s the one day where we can all just be kids again.

Echo Park is well known for the iconic movie “Mi Vida Loca “ (1993) and car shows hosted by El Clasico Tattoo shop. Restaurants like Rodeo Mexican Grill, Señor Fish and Mayas’ Tacos Restaurant have exposed the community to Latin cuisines. The beautiful lake of Echo Park used to be filled with street vendors selling various items inside the park, from esquites and raspados to Baja blankets and a variety of other Latin American treats. However, through the years, there have been changes to the community that have harmed these small businesses. 
The community is predominantly made up of low-income Hispanic people — an estimated 64% of the population, with the Spanish language spoken in 63% of homes. Additionally, 24.5% of the residents are below the poverty line. 
Stores like Crown Shoes, Jumbo Bargain, La Guadalupana Market and local 99 cent stores served the community with affordable resources ranging from school uniforms, low-cost groceries and affordable house supplies. The stores each offered different but beneficial services to the community. Now, they have dissipated into thin air with stores like Hey Hey Boba, American Barber Shop, and Hammer & Nails taking their place but doing nothing to make up for the resources taken away in their stead.
But it’s not just the resources that have been diminished — it’s also the culture. On the building of the luxury lingerie store Cantiq, a mural painted by Ricardo Mendoza in 2000 named “Sculpting Another Destiny” is displayed. The painting illustrates a lotus flower blooming from Echo Park Lake, with figures representing the individuals who were part of previous generations and were key to the nurturing of life within the area. The mural is not just pleasing to the eye, but holds significant meaning to those who resided in the area for decades. Since Cantiq’s move into the building, pieces of this art have been lost as the store painted over portions of the mural. As an Echo Park resident, seeing the green and teal colors be painted over with yellow presents how fast the community is changing. It doesn’t just feel as though these murals — which have been there for over 20 years — are being painted over, but the entire community itself is being repainted to suit the needs of those who don’t even live in the area.
Outside of the expensive grocery options that now reside in Echo Park are inaccessible to the residents who live there, the diverse food options that were once a hallmark of the area have become much harder to find. Groceries aren’t just more difficult to attain, but creating Latin American dishes that hold dear to many residents has also become much more inconvenient. 
First, the murals were broken apart. Then, the stores and food diversity chipped away. And, in March 2021, Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O’ Farrell’s plan to evict the unhoused residents living in Echo Park Lake began. 
With the coronavirus pandemic at its peak and many residents uncertain of their living situation for the months to come, living in the park was the safest and, at times, the only option for many. While residents were told they would be provided housing, UCLA interviewed 41 of those residents, and found 31 still unhoused, six having passed away and only four living in housing at the time of the interview. During this eviction, a fence covering the entirety of the park was placed and is still present to this day, sparking protests and discomfort to Echo Park residents.
Echo Park has forever been a home to me, but the changes to the community make me feel unsettled and displaced. I remember the La Guadalupana Market as I came out of the bus from middle school to grab snacks before entering the tutoring program El Centro Del Pueblo offered. There were esquites sold inside the market and music playing inside the park. Small details like these defined Echo Park, and the changes made these past few years have done nothing to improve the area.
As this continues, the resources for the neighborhood are being cut down, leaving community members to fend for themselves. The community of Echo Park is known for its one-hour swan boat rental and annual lotus festival. But, there is much more to the community. 
Mi lindo Echo Park has car shows on Sunset Boulevard and art inside El Clasico Tattoo Shop. Sunday’s Best, a thrift store, is filled with hidden treasures and iconic Spanish rock songs recognizable to even my Mexican mother. Their addition of dollar racks and price range with thrift items below 10 dollars provide access to sustainable and affordable clothing that L.A. is lacking much of. 
We must all acknowledge the community these gentrifiers have entered and learn about the history of the area rather than dismissing the grounds they have moved into. We can’t afford any more of Echo Park’s beauty to be tarnished or lost in the depths of these unnecessary urban changes.
