In a letter sent to the USC community Monday morning, Provost Michael Quick condemned racism and other forms of discrimination, calling USC a multicultural community of people from diverse backgrounds.

The letter came nine days after Aubtin Heydari, a senior majoring in screenwriting, was reportedly injured while counter-protesting a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va. 
“Intense political rhetoric divides our nation, and incidents of bias and discrimination degrade our humanity,” Quick wrote in the statement. “We denounce all forms of hatred, racism, and bigotry.”
Two days before the letter from the Provost’s office was released, a statement of solidarity for Heydari began circulating on social media, reaching over 700 signatures in two days.
The petition was started by the USC Cinema and Media Studies Graduate Association. In it, the student organization affirms its support for Heydari, who was hit when a vehicle ran into him and 19 other counter-protesters, one of whom was killed. 
The statement also included a reaction to USC’s lack of support for Heydari at the time, especially since other institutions had denounced hate and racism immediately after the violent attacks in Charlottesville occurred.
On Sunday, however, Elizabeth Daley, the dean of the School of Cinematic Arts, addressed the petition and said that SCA reached out to Heydari the Monday following the Charlottesville attacks.
Daley also denounced hatred and racism, and expressed her support for Heydari.
“We worked over the course of last week to ensure that all necessary accommodations by the relevant student support offices would be made upon his return. [ … ] I feel it is important to share the fact that our response in support of our student was immediate and thorough, and will continue as long as necessary,” Daley said.
Philana Payton, a Ph.D. student in cinema and media studies who helped write and circulate the petition, said that she was shocked USC did not immediately release a statement about the Charlottesville attacks.
“Our biggest concern is the fact that the University has yet to make any public denouncement of the alt-right, white supremacists, ‘unite the right’ rallies and neo-Nazis that are terrorizing cities across the country,” Payton said. 
Subsequent to the petition’s publication, the post was later updated to say that Heydari had been contacted by USC administration.
Heydari said he was grateful for the support, as he recovers from his injuries at a hospital in Charlottesville.
“The fact that they put this petition together and so many people signed it really touches me in a very sincere way,” Heydari said.
Heydari also said he received an email from Lynette Merriman, associate vice provost for campus crisis support and intervention. He added that the message was time-marked as Aug. 13, a day after the Charlottesville attacks. Heydari said he only saw the email recently.
“I have been informed that you were a victim of the tragic events in Charlottesville this weekend,” the email read. “ I am so, so sorry to hear that you were injured. Please let me know if we can do anything to assist you … do not hesitate to contact me.”
Heydari declined to comment in regard to the specifics of his injuries and the occurrences in Charlottesville, but the letter to SCA from Daley said that he had a successful surgery and will be returning to campus in the coming weeks. 
“All my life I have been called a terrorist because of my ethnicity,” Heydari posted on his Facebook the night of the Charlottesville attacks. “Today I was hit by one in a car. He was a white man.”
The petition ended by thanking Heydari for his contributions to equality and social justice, both in Charlottesville and at USC.
“Heydari is consistently on the frontlines advocating for transformative social justice both on and off campus,” the statement read. “We are thankful that he survived the Charlottesville terrorist attack and that he is healing. We will continue to stand in solidarity with Heydari as he prepares to return to campus.”
The letter sent out by the Provost’s office also reminded students the importance of the diversity of ideas and backgrounds.
“In a place like USC where a diversity of perspectives and opinions are welcomed, and even necessary for our mission, we must find ways to respect and honor differences while also affirming our shared values and aspirations,” Quick wrote.

Emily Smith | Daily Trojan
The women’s soccer team enjoyed the unveiling of its national championship banner on Friday, and No. 3 USC celebrated by topping unranked UC Davis 2-1 to open the regular season. 
Before the pre-game national anthem, players, coaches and fans at McAlister Field watched a black cover lift to reveal the 2016 NCAA National Championship banner in the northwest corner of the stadium. The title now accompanies the team’s 2007 banner, reminding visiting Pac-12 rivals that USC stands as the only program in the conference with two national titles.
Coming off a 1-0-1 preseason — during which the Women of Troy drew against UC Irvine and beat Long Beach State — the reigning champions got off to a hot start on opening day against the Aggies. Redshirt senior striker Alex Anthony opened the scoring in the 22nd minute. Junior forward Leah Pruitt rifled a shot on net from just inside the 18-yard box, but Alexis Smith turned it away in the UC Davis net. Fortunately for the Trojans, Anthony was stationed in front of the goal and tapped the ball home with the outside of her right foot.
While USC saw a few more opportunities, the remainder of the first half was scoreless on both sides. But the Women of Troy wasted no time on offense at the start of the second half.
Just four minutes in, Pruitt found herself with a one-on-one breakaway versus the Aggies’ keeper. Smith denied the junior once again, but USC regrouped and finished what Pruitt started. Freshman midfielder Arlie Jones netted her first career goal in the 50th minute, pounding in the team’s second goal on a spectacular diving header off a cross from redshirt freshman forward Samantha Bruder.
UC Davis responded with a goal of its own seven minutes later. Senior midfielder McKeegan Mandy placed a free kick into the top corner to cut the Trojan lead in half. But it would not be enough for the Aggies. USC maintained ball control and fashioned several more scoring opportunities, and UC Davis was unable to establish its rhythm.
“I thought offensively we were better than we have been,” head coach Keidane McAlpine said. “We have been working on it, and we got a chance to show that today.” 
But McAlpine also noted that his players need to maintain their intensity throughout the full 90 minutes.
“All in all, we need to be a bit more offensive in the final third,” he said. “[We] need to be more disciplined in the back and not give up set pieces.”
While USC’s offense ripped off a whopping 22 shots, the team’s real success stemmed from its defense. The Women of Troy limited the Aggies to a measly four shots, of which only two were on goal.
Though McAlpine was critical of his team’s discipline, he had a positive outlook on the 2017 season. 
“Overall, great first game to get us going,” he said. “But we still have a lot of work to do.”
USC has a 13-day recess before it travels to Columbia, Mo. to battle Missouri on Sept. 1. The Tigers opened the season with two comfortable victories, and they will have played four regular-season tilts by the time McAlpine and company take the field next Friday.

Memorandum
To: USC faculty, staff and students
From: Black Student Assembly
Subject: Statement of purpose
Date: August 20, 2017
BSA will fight to protect and expand diversity
At USC, we aspire to create a safe environment that accommodates and protects all natural rights, including the right to forge cultural and political alliances. Due to recent events that reflect unaddressed underlying cleavages in our collective existence as a nation, we must continue to reassess and indeed redouble our efforts. We want to better prepare for — and prevent — future outbursts of hate and division by promoting a mindful, inclusive and safe campus. 
It has been brought to our attention that there has been a wave of discontent regarding the origins of USC statues and their affiliations. The Black Student Assembly has not claimed to invest into the removal of any statues at the University of Southern California. We are concerned about rhetoric that may inspire acts of hate, bigotry and violence. These events do not occur in isolated areas or time frames, but have the potential to continually affect our Trojan family. Our hearts go out to other campuses, students or individuals that have been affected by hate crimes and the overall atmosphere they foster. We will proceed to search for and implement proper courses of action to prevent such acts from occurring on our campus without being met by appropriate consequences. 
As an organization that has a history of fighting for resources, space and dialogue, we will continue to uphold these accomplishments to the best of our ability. Events inspired or motivated by hate, bigotry and violence will not be actions that we tolerate on our campus. If such events take place, we will not only require but demand that there be an active response from our University as well as our peers within the student body. 
Our University has grown, and will continue to grow in diversity. With that in mind, we intend to protect those spaces that allow for diversity and inclusion. We recognize that diversity and inclusion are matters regarding which the University is continuously developing. However, we will stand against any unfair or unjust policies or responses that go overlooked or unacknowledged. We will require active dialogue as to how we can continue to foster an atmosphere of mutual respect and promote the values of diversity and inclusion on our campus.

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
After events in Charlottesville, the deaths of one counter-protester and two state troopers, the social media outcry and the silent grappling with what would come next, came the public statements. Celebrities, artists and politicians almost universally condemned the white supremacists who brought violence and terror to Charlottesville last weekend. But there was also a call for unity from lawmakers aligned with the Trump administration, who denounced racism and hate as un-American values despite individual histories of utilizing or benefiting from racist ideology.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions deemed the hatred in Charlottesville “just not part of our heritage.” House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted: “This bigotry is counter to all this country stands for.” And President Donald Trump wavered on taking a stance before insisting that “this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence” was the responsibility of “many sides” — apparently equating the ideals of the people who marched against white supremacists with the values of white supremacists themselves. 
And yet, the reality stands: People of color have been listening to white people say “I’m not racist” for decades and decades, and it has never, ever, not once, meant anything. Such a claim tends to almost always be a preface to something demeaning, a cover-up for something that’s already been done, a distraction for the true nature of what’s inside a facade of “civility” that has always been the privilege of those in power.
The words of Ryan, Sessions and countless other GOP lawmakers who denounce white supremacy don’t just fall flat — they further destroy the message they are trying to convey. How is anyone to believe Sessions, who condemned the NAACP and ACLU, or Ryan, who accepted Trump and normalized his behavior? How is anyone to believe Trump himself, the man whose campaign, slogan and name are the pride and joy of the very racists he claims to condemn?
What these privileged lawmakers do not understand, but what the scores of minority citizens they lead can explain, is that racism — the quality white people hate to be labeled with more than anything — is not an individual choice. There exists no on and off-switch inside a person’s heart that governs how they behave or think about the people around them. 
Racism is insidious, silent, ceaseless and systemic — and race pervades everything. Former President Barack Obama, in his now-famously popular tweet sent in the aftermath of the violence in Charlottesville, quoted Nelson Mandela: “No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion.” And that is true. But by the time a child has become an independently thinking adult, themes of racism and prejudice — no matter how subtle — have become ingrained in them so deeply that it is no longer a choice to hate. And this indoctrination of values will not go away with words and statements: It will go away when systems are remade by the minorities whom they have always been geared against.
People who talk about the plight of “white genocide” and the hope of making this country great again are not threatened by anything other than the very presence of minorities in American jobs and the American economy, the minorities who manage to climb the social ladder above the white working class when years ago their ancestors could not.
It is devastating that people who feed off this ideology, like the neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville, can grow violent, and devalue minorities and their allies to the extent of driving a car into a crowd, not at all caring for the lives they destroy. A peaceful, anti-racism protester died, and still it is the white supremacists claiming to be silenced. It is they who march into cities shouting specific and targeted hate, and still denounce as “racist” and “anti-white” a multicultural opposition whose primary stance is that all people are created equal.
White supremacy is marked by an embrace of victimhood voiced by those who have never truly understood what it means to be victimized in the grand scope of the American dream. It is the ideology of those who have never been bullied, underestimated, ignored, made to feel unsafe because of the color of their skin — to feel these things every waking second and then to be admonished that they are too sensitive. White nationalists have never been pounded down every step of the way only to be informed, at the precipice of success, that they have only succeeded because of affirmative action and a trending attraction to diversity.
To be a person of color in America is exhausting, all-encompassing and inescapable, and minority experiences are vastly different depending on ethnicity and background. To denounce racism is the lowest bar, one that deserves no applause — especially when the president himself cannot even step across it. And of course, words are powerful catalysts that can create movements, but they mean absolutely nothing when there are no actions to match. That is when those words become lies, the cheapest form of political currency. 
Last Thursday, the president tweeted again, deploring the takedown of Confederate statues as an assault on American history. He further added that “the beauty that is being taken out of our cities, towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!”
Trump’s deeming that these statues were perhaps not morally redeemable but beautiful, physically pleasing, and that’s why they have value — is absurd. But it’s also eerily fitting, his estimation that these monuments have nothing to stand for but their exteriors. These outward appearances are in themselves enough to justify their histories of devastation and suffering, their actions built on the belief that there are those who exist who are superior to others.  
And so it goes with words, and those with enough privilege to think denouncing racism is the same thing as believing it.
If there is one thing for which our president is to be remembered, it is his lack of empathy both profound and selective toward white citizens, an ideology that is leaking directly into America’s public conscience. It’s easy to denounce racism, but much less so to understand that racism is itself not an outward expression but a catalyst for such misdeeds. Racism is not composed only of what people say or do -— it’s embedded deep inside.

So if this white guy says he’s not a racist, I’m a liar?
Racism is bad. I don’t like it. Outlaw all forms of homogeneity, hegemony and conformity.  DO IT NOW!
You are a racist if you call someone else a racist just because they disagree with you.  This is what is happening in today’s society and that behavior pattern is wrong and misguided. And only 1 person died as a result of the riot in CHarlottesville.  The two pilots in the police helicopter didn’t die as a result of the riots. They died as a result of poor maintenance on the helicopter, not the riot.
So yes, for lackof a better term, thought they are nothing “right”, the alt-right, like the alt-left have a 1st Amendment right to free speech. The problem with the alt-left groups like Antifa, BLM, BAMN and others, is they are not 1A proponents. Quite the contrary, they are fascists.  They shut down any opinion that doesn’t follow theirs.  They riot and cause damage to taxpayor funded property and personal property for the sake of their hatred toward others.  There’s no mistaking the fact that these alt-left groups are radicalized by the alt-left media and the progressive Democrats of the DNC.  Be careful what you wish for and follow, because you are being fed a can of lies by CNN, MSNBC and all the other anti-Trump hating media and political groups.  
Just know this.  Until Trump decided to run for POTUS, he was loved, respected and cherished by everyone including liberals and the Democrats, for being level headed, sympathetic to the poor and the disadvantaged.  There is proof of his behavior patterns over his entire adult life. He is being vilified by the one world government followers and the “swmp” of Washington DC long term politicians, because they know he is draining that cesspool of career politicians and will push for term limits for Congress and the Senate, just as every state governor, and the President and VP have.
These hateful and nefarious entities are represented by the alt-left of Antifa, BLM, BAMN, marxists, other fascist organizations, the alt-left media of CNN, MSNBC, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox News today, AP, BBC to name a few; others include the Democratic Party, the RINOs. No POTUS in history has had this type of obstructionist efforts against him.  How would you feel if these actions where against Obama or Hillary.  You would be very upset, too.
I thank God every day that Hillary is not our President.
Amen
