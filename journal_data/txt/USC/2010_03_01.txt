From the vantage point of University Park Campus, the skyline of Downtown sometimes feels like little more than a distant promise of the bustle of commerce and events. Many students feel at a loss to find out what’s actually going on in the heart of the city.
Melissa Shamooilian | Daily Trojan
That’s exactly what three USC seniors wondered last summer, prompting the creation of NiteFlip.com, a website that tells visitors what’s happening on any given night in Downtown Los Angeles.
NiteFlip focuses on events, concerts, D.J. bar appearances, restaurants, lounges and more. The site was designed to provide all the information needed for a night out in Downtown.
NiteFlip is the brainchild of seniors Jason Raede, a senior majoring in international relations, and Yoav Weiss, a senior majoring in architecture, but the pair recruited Ana Mazdyasni, a senior majoring in public relations, to launch and promote the site. The idea was born one night when Raede and Weiss were looking for something to do on an “off” night but couldn’t find any advertised events. When they realized there was no definitive resource compiling all the events happening Downtown, they created their own source for nightlife information.
“We looked online, and we were like, ‘For sure there’s a website we can use,’” Raede said. “Then we couldn’t find anything, so we thought, ‘For sure we’re on to something.’”
They wanted to create a service that provided USC students with the latest information on local deals and nightly specials happening around campus. And from there, niteflip.com was born.
“Our big thing is what is happening right now and what is happening when you want to go out,” Weiss said.
Though still in its beginning stages, NiteFlip caters to USC students and those who live in the greater Downtown area.
Raede and Weiss had previously started a web design company that focused on small businesses, so they felt technically prepared to make a site that is first and foremost user friendly. Impressively enough, they created the website and all of its contents and features themselves.
NiteFlip was designed to take the work out of looking for what to do. Visitors to the site can see what is happening right now and at any date or time in the future using a “smart search” feature that Raede and Weiss created.
The two search online, make phone calls and track down word-of-mouth specials to compile all the events listed on their site. NiteFlip is updated every day with new events and venues.
“A lot of these places don’t really advertise their promotions, or the information isn’t really that accessible,” Mazdyasni said.
You can also browse by event type — D.J. sets, drink specials or happy hours, for example. Users also have the option of searching by venue, including Downtown bars, clubs, pubs, lounges and restaurants.
For a general idea of events, there is a weekly calendar that tracks entertainment options by area or type. Once users set up a login, they’re able to designate their favorite venues and personalize settings that make events appear in their personal calendars.
NiteFlip is heavily dependent on user input and feedback. All members are encouraged to submit events and venues. The idea, the creators said, is to eventually have users keep the site running on their submissions. Raede and Weiss also hope to incorporate reviews sometime in the future.
The site’s founders also created a mobile version of NiteFlip to make the service accessible on smart phones. For ease of access, they’re also working to create free iPhone and Blackberry applications, and users can share NiteFlip through Twitter, MySpace and Facebook.
Although NiteFlip is up and running, the majority of the site’s most complicated features are still works in progress.
One of Raede and Weiss’ more unique goals is to eventually create the “Flip My Nite” feature where users can input where they want to go, how many stops they would like to make and what kind of events or venues they’re looking for. With that information, NiteFlip can then create an instant city crawl plan.
The site’s planned NitePoints will also be a plus for regular users. Points will be earned by submitting venues and events to the database as well as ratings and reviews, which will eventually reward users with gift cards and NiteFlip apparel.
“We haven’t worked out the details yet, but we want to encourage people to use the site to have it be mutually beneficial,” Weiss said.
NiteFlip is the first of its kind to cater to USC students, Mazdyasni stressed that the site was truly created with everyone in mind. This site is useful whether you are a student or not; it is designed for anyone who wants to experience Downtown.

Twice a year, I pay a visit to the affectionately christened Elliott Smith Memorial Wall. Located on Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake, the wall — which to most simply stands as the exterior of Solutions, an electronic store — has become a sacred site for nostalgic Smith fans since the singer-songwriter’s untimely death in 2003.
The whimsical swirls of red, blue and white paint served as the cover art for Smith’s 2000 album, Figure 8, the last record the Los Angeles-from-Portland musician would complete before his death. Although photographer Autumn de Wilde’s picture of a shy Smith, hands in pockets and shoulders slouched, is a prominent image that has undoubtedly been inducted into album cover hall of fame, it is now better known as a makeshift memorial with scrawls of Sharpie-outlined messages and lyrics that attracts numerous sad, hands-in-pockets and shoulders-slouched indie-rock devotees.
Like Jim Morrison’s grave in Pere Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, the Elliott Smith Memorial Wall serves as a site where fans not only pay tribute to a beloved artist but also wonder — and perhaps dream — of what could have been if Smith’s career were not cut short.
It’s an unfortunate but altogether natural sentiment that often surfaces with the loss of an artist, especially when he seems to have a vast vault of material to offer. On a more trivial level, this feeling also materializes with the announcement of the breakup of a popular or cult-favorite band.
Some fans are satisfied with remembering the artist or band the way they were, whether alive or together, and the music they have already produced and released. Others, however, are left wanting more.
Fortunately for those who cannot let go, the music industry knows how to capitalize on this need.
The art of rehashing, remixing and re-releasing material from late musicians is not exactly a new practice. Rock pioneer Buddy Holly had a majority of his work released following his unexpected death in 1959; for nearly 10 years after his passing, Coral Records unleashed both singles and full-length albums onto the music market.
Similarly, Otis Redding’s “(Sittin’ On) The Dock of the Bay” became the first posthumous single in chart history in 1968, while rock idol and heralded guitarist Jimi Hendrix has seven posthumous albums to his name.
In the last decade, deceased hip-hop artists, such as Notorious B.I.G., Tupac Shakur and TLC’s Lisa “Left Eye” Lopez, have also joined the list of artists with posthumous records.
And even Smith’s wall was not enough, as From a Basement on a Hill was released in 2004 (a record that was already four years into production); New Moon, a two-disc compilation of tracks excluded from albums, followed in 2007; and the reissue of Smith’s debut LP, Roman Candle, is due out this April.
But in recent years, the music pipeline has been inflated with not only posthumous records but also reissues and compilations from bands that may have flatlined but whose members are still kicking.
In 2009, seminal yet little known all-female punk band The Raincoats re-released its self-titled debut album, while Pavement, the godfathers of indie-rock who disbanded in 1999, has publicized a reunion after its newfound resurgence of cultural relevance and is launching its best of compilation, Quarantine the Past: The Best of Pavement, in March.
And just last week, the Rolling Stones announced it was going to release a re-mastered version of the band’s most critically acclaimed record, the 1972 blues-rock tour de force Exile on Main Street. The reissue, which will also be available in an ultra-deluxe package that includes a 30-minute documentary DVD and 50-page collector’s book, features 10 brand-new tracks as well as alternate takes of “Soul Survivor” and “Loving Cup.”
Akin to the movie industry, which has its sticklers for film preservation (with Martin Scorsese leading the way), remastering an artist’s recordings, whether he’s deceased or retired, is often backed by the altruistic undertaking of protecting the artist’s work.
Larry Crane, editor of Tape Op Magazine and archivist for Smith’s family, contends that the decision to reissue Roman Candle primarily resulted from a production concern.
“The intention that I had was to make the album more listenable,” said Crane in an interview with FACT. “I felt that a lot of the guitar ‘squeaks’ were jarring and very loud and that many of the hard consonants and ‘S’ sounds were jarring and scratchy sounding.”
But others, including Stones guitarist Keith Richards, believe it is in the fans’ best interest to maintain the music’s production purity.
“I really wanted to leave them pretty much as they were,” Richards said in a recent interview with Rolling Stone. “I didn’t want to interfere … They still had that great basement sound.”
For the musicians who are still around but are not producing new material and the music industry that’s currently coping with digital media and relatively meager record sales, these reissues are certainly money makers. From legends like the Rolling Stones and the Beatles — whose 1 compilation album, released in 2000, was the best-selling record of the last decade — to formative indie rockers like Pavement — who are scheduled to play its first show in 10 years this month — these reissues are a surefire way to cash in on an already existing fan base.
Yet there’s more truth in a legacy an artist has created on his terms, even if it is in the form of an artfully painted wall belonging to an audio-video repair shop.
Certainly, the fancy packaging, hi-fi sound and prospect of never-before-heard material is intriguing, but sometimes it’s easier to simply let go and let the music live on.
Lauren Barbato is a senior majoring in writing for screen and television. Her column, “Sound Check,” runs Tuesdays.
It’s nice to see a thoughtful article on re-issues, remastering and posthumous albums. I’d like to point out that the main reason Elliott Smith’s “Roman Candle” album ended up getting remastered was that it and “From a Basement on the Hill” were licensed to Kill Rock Stars this year (they had been on other labels and the contracts were up). When the time came to find the master tapes for “Roman Candle” I suggested that since the album had never really been mastered in the first place that with this change of label and US debut on vinyl that it would be a good time to consider remastering. In no way is this an attempt to “re-sell” or capitalize on Elliott’s work, but just an attempt to present it in a better light for posterity. Note that the album is not remixed and there are no bonus tracks. Thanks!

The name Jason Derulo already draws significant recognition for a singer who has not released more than two songs to the public.
Ridin’ solo · Hip-hop artist Jason Derulo, who rose to fame with the chart-topper “Whatcha Say,” releases an eponymous debut Tuesday. -  Photo courtesy of Warner Bros. 
An accomplished songwriter and producer, Derulo has worked with artists such as Lil Wayne and Sean Kingston before getting in the studio to record his own material. After an eight months of production however, his self-titled debut album is finally ready for release.
The Miami native is also a professionally trained dancer and has acted in several plays in the New York theater scene. Derulo is a man of many trades, and his love for variety is apparent in his music as well. Many of his songs are fused with elements from different genres, setting him apart from the countless other hip-hop up-and-comers.
The album’s opening track is the single that first put him on the map, the ubiquitous “Whatcha Say.” Its infectious chorus, soulful snapping and clever, unexpected sampling of Imogen Heap’s “Hide and Seek” helped push the song to number one on Billboard charts in the United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand.
Still on heavy rotation in most mainstream radio stations, “Whatcha Say” provides the played-out tale of a cheating lover begging for forgiveness a new spin by explaining he should get another chance because one day he’ll be rich and famous. This amusing mix of sincerity and cockiness starts the album off on precisely the right foot.
“Ridin’ Solo” is next, continuing the upbeat mood. The crisp finger snaps from the previous track make another appearance interspersed in the song’s lyrics, adding to the simple, danceable beat. Easygoing lyrics about the life of a single man round out this solid second track.
The album’s second official single “In My Head,” has recently reached number nine in the United States. With a more pop-influenced sound, the up-tempo song will probably only keep climbing.
It is only moderately catchy, however, so this follow-up single is lackluster in comparison to its predecessor.
The dance party continues with the fourth track, which is slated to be released as his third single. “The Sky’s the Limit” is arguably the most forgettable song on the album; Derulo’s usually silky voice is annoyingly drowned out by overzealous Auto-Tuning, and thumping beats overpower the indistinguishable chorus. The rave-like feel that carries on with seemingly no end makes it difficult to find any real substance in this mess of a song.
Completely changing the mood, track five is a mellow ballad about planning a wedding. The sweet lyrics in “What If” are a stark contrast from the spicy metaphors Derulo offers in his tracks about the single life. While it is a refreshing break from the nonstop dancehall ditties, it still doesn’t offer much creatively. The verses, lined with clichés about soul mates and love at first sight, don’t break new ground.
It isn’t until the following track, “Love Hangover,” that Derulo returns to the fresh sound present in his first few songs. Also a pop-tinged number, this track would be a much better choice for a third single. Buoyant without being overly synthetic, the background beats complement Derulo’s voice instead of overpower it.
Continuing the trend of songs dealing with relationships, “Encore” is a more relaxed track about wanting more time with a significant other. The few not-so-subtle sexual innuendos in the hook and verses are uncomfortable not clever, which doesn’t help the awkward beat of the song. It’s as if the track wants to be a ballad, but the random bursts of synthesized sounds detract from its sincerity.
Derulo tries his hand at R&B with “Fallen,” a slower track about falling in love unexpectedly. His vocals really get the chance to shine in the catchy chorus, but there is still a hint of Auto-Tuning that is hard to ignore.
Derulo is at his prime when not suppressed by tacky computer-generated sounds, and a stripped-down version of this song would have been much more influential. An acoustic version in the future would probably be a hit.
“Blind,” the final track on the regular version of the album, is a sleepy ballad that won’t leave listeners much to remember. A repetitive chorus can’t be saved by the finger snaps Derulo is so fond of, and in the end the track gets lost in the shuffle of mediocre closing songs.
As a whole, the album has potential, but Derulo’s attempt to fuse together so many different elements in his music can sometimes be overwhelming.
The album only contains nine songs, disappointing considering he recorded about 300 tracks during his studio time. Many of those not on the album are floating around the Internet, and many of them are superior to the songs on the album. For example, Derulo is at his best in the honest ballad “Perfect,” which combines acoustic guitar, a sultry beat and pristine vocals.
Hopefully Derulo isn’t just another flash in the pan. Once he resolves to not let his technology get the better of him, he has a lot to offer.

The USC baseball team looks to snap its three-game losing streak tonight in Long Beach, Calif., as the Trojans take on the Long Beach State 49ers at Blair Field.
Nicked up · Senior starter Kevin Couture was injured during Sunday’s loss to UCLA and is among a large contingent of Trojans with injuries. - Geo Tu | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (3-4), who lost to Oklahoma State, Vanderbilt and rival UCLA over the weekend in the Dodgertown Classic, are still unsure who will start tonight’s matchup. Sophomore starter Ben Mount was set to start the contest, but he pitched 4 1/3 innings Sunday after replacing injured senior Kevin Couture at Dodger Stadium. Couture was hit on his pitching hand on a come backer in the second inning.
With Mount now out of the mix for tonight’s matchup, USC will turn to juniors Brett Williams, Chris Mezger or sophomore Brad Douthit.
USC coach Chad Kreuter said that although injuries are upsetting they create opportunities for other players to step up.
“I’m hoping someone will expose themselves as a frontline guy,” Kreuter said. “That’s what you hope for when you have injuries and guys get an opportunity to play.”
The 49ers (3-3), on the other hand, have a few starting options to turn to because of Sunday’s rainout against Arizona. Long Beach State can either start sophomore Brandon Pinder on extra rest or skip Pinder’s turn in the rotation completely and go with freshman Eddie Magallon. Pinder (0-1) allowed four runs in six innings with two strikeouts in his first outing against Cal State Fullerton, while Magallon (0-1) gave up three runs in 4 2/3 innings in a losing effort against UCLA last Tuesday.
The 49ers are hitting .269 as a team, compared with the Trojans’ .286, and their staff ERA is 4.58, compared with USC’s 5.71.
Although Long Beach State’s offense is not prolific in the power department, Kreuter said the 49ers use the humid air surrounding Blair Field because of its proximity to the ocean to their advantage by playing small ball. The 49ers are traditionally known to steal a lot of bases, drop many bunts, execute hit and runs, and play exceptional defense throughout their games.
Even though the ball doesn’t carry well at Blair Field, Kreuter said his team is prepared to adjust to the environment.
“I’ve been building this ball club to compete on both venues,” Krueter said. “We’re a small ball team, and then also, obviously, we have some guys that can hit some home runs too and hit for some power. We also feel our defense can defend against the small ball.”
The key for USC in tonight’s contest will be avoiding the little mistakes that followed it throughout the weekend. Kreuter said the Trojans need to speed up their delivery times to the plate, control the running game and stabilize the defense behind the plate to be successful.
By eliminating those mistakes, he believes his team can compete with anyone.
The coach said the best thing for his team right now is to get back on the field and forget about the losing weekend.
“This game is huge,” Kreuter said, emphasizing that his team needs to get back on the winning track as soon as possible. “This team has battle in it. We’ve got a lot of fight.”
First pitch at Blair Field is scheduled for 6:30 p.m.
When does Kreuter get fired?? He is a disgrace to this legendary program.

As draft day nears, several Trojan football players hope their performances at the NFL combine will help increase their draft stock.
Strong day · Tight end Anthony McCoy posted a strong 40-yard dash time of 4.79 seconds and bench pressed 225 pounds 19 times. -  Daily Trojan file photo 
And those that went through workouts didn’t disappoint.
Former defensive end Everson Griffen showed off his agility with a 40-yard dash time of 4.66 seconds, which tied for second best among defensive linemen.
Not only did he impress scouts with his speed, but he also flexed his muscle by bench-pressing 32 repetitions of 225 pounds, which was as many bench-press repetitions as Nebraska defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, who is projected to be the first overall pick in the draft.
On the offensive side, Jeff Byers recorded 33 repetitions of bench presses, which was good for sixth best among offensive linemen.
Several other former offensive players impressed NFL scouts as well. 
Running back Joe McKnight silenced a few critics with a notable workout of his own.
Scouts were skeptical of how well his skills would translate to the NFL, but he posted a 40-yard dash time of 4.47, which was good for fifth among running backs.
He was also among the running back leaders in vertical jumps and broad jumps.
Wide receiver Damian Williams solidified his second-round status and perhaps even made a case to be taken earlier with an impressive workout.
His 40-yard dash time was in the low 4.5 second range, and he was among the wide receiver leaders in several workouts including the bench press, vertical jump and three-cone drill, which tests an athlete’s ability to change directions.
Tight end Anthony McCoy didn’t help his stock much, but he did post an adequate 40-yard dash time of 4.79 seconds and bench-pressed 19 repetitions.
“The day could have gone better for [McCoy],” ESPN analyst Todd McShay said. “He also had a few drops, which was also a problem for him during Senior Bowl week. We knew he was somewhat limited athletically, so McCoy did not hurt his second-round grade much, but he did miss a chance to get in to the first-round conversation.”
Out of all these players, however, it was Stafon Johnson who impressed scouts with more than just his football skills — it was his courage.
After a freak weight-lifting accident that almost took his football career and his life, Johnson bench-pressed 13 repetitions at the combine.
And though he wasn’t one of the leaders in repetitions, the fact that he decided to do the workout was enough for some.
Jumbalaya jimbu!
Stafon Johnson ist ein Mann unter Männern, einem zutreffenden Führer und Geschenk vom Gott

Through six innings the score was tied.
USC and UCLA were in the midst of a 1-1 pitchers’ duel on a beautiful Sunday afternoon at Dodger Stadium. The early season rivalry game was living up to its name.
But then all too quickly it unraveled for the Trojans.
Sophomore pitcher Ben Mount, who had pitched brilliantly in relief of injured starter Kevin Couture, ran into trouble in the bottom of the seventh. He gave up a lead-off single to UCLA pinch hitter Marc Navarro and walked infielder Tyler Rahmatulla.
Senior pitcher Shuhei Fujiya relieved Mount but threw a wild pitch and gave up a seeing-eye one-out single that found its way through a drawn-in infield. Two runs scored.
Down 3-1, the Trojans failed to capitalize in the eighth inning with two runners on base, but UCLA didn’t quit in its half of the frame.
Amid an array of erratic USC pitching and UCLA line drives that landed in the outfield gaps, the Trojans’ relievers combined to give up three more runs in the bottom of the inning.
The game that was a back-and-forth nail-biter blossomed into a 6-1 Bruin blowout within a half hour.
“We made some little mistakes that ended up costing us the whole weekend,” USC coach Chad Kreuter said.
A loss to a rival is never easy to swallow, especially when it tops off a 0-3 weekend that also included defeats at the hands of baseball powerhouses Oklahoma State and Vanderbilt.
But the most unfortunate thing for the USC baseball team is that losing to UCLA is nothing new.
In fact, the Trojans have dropped 10 of their last 13 to their crosstown rival.
A win Sunday at Dodger Stadium this early in the season could have represented a Trojan turnaround and sent a message that USC baseball is ready to compete with the top teams in the Pac-10.
Kreuter, however, tried to downplay Sunday’s game, referring to it as just another game that could have added a mark in the Trojans’ win column.
“We only play UCLA four times during the season,” he said. “I’m concerned with playing the game that’s in front of us every single day. We have to win as many games as we can.”
Well, maybe Kreuter should be a little more concerned about UCLA. Not only are the Bruins a rival, but they represent one of five teams that stand as the class of the Pac-10 at the moment.
With the competitive likes of No. 2 Arizona State, No. 10 Oregon State, No. 17 UCLA, No. 18 Stanford and No. 25 Oregon all in contention for the conference title, USC will have to face and beat a lot of top-ranked opponents if it looks to break its playoff drought.
Beating UCLA would have been a nice start. It also would have caused those other teams to take notice of USC baseball.
I’m not saying that Sunday’s loss will determine the team’s fate for the rest of the year, but it could have bumped the Trojans back in the right direction after dropping two games over the weekend.
After its promising 3-1 start to the season, USC now finds itself under .500 at 3-4 and is probably questioning whether it can compete against top-flight teams.
As it is, USC is projected to finish eighth in the Pac-10.
Eighth.
That’s unacceptable for any Trojan team.
The talent is there. USC has a solid crop of high-potential pitchers and some strong bats that have shown surprising promise in the early going. But the game is about wins, and USC hasn’t compiled any in the past few days — and not very many in the past few seasons either.
According to Kreuter, the team’s aim is to reach about 34 victories in order to have a chance to advance to regionals.
But if USC wants to reach the playoffs, it needs to start playing with the confidence and swagger that flooded through this program for years — the same poise that has resulted in a Division I-best 11 NCAA titles.
It also needs to start beating the top teams in the Pac-10, including those guys over in Westwood.

What colored glasses are you looking through with saying  the talent is there? Maybe for a .500 season there is enough which is the way it has been for the last three years under Kreuter. The position players have O’Neill, DiPinto, and Oropesa who have proven themselves while pitching only Triggs has the resume. A lot of cream has to rise to the top for this team to be successful, and reach 34 wins.

For Brendan Henning, his Saturday afternoon began at the Home Depot, where he purchased $40 of PVC pipe and a ream of red duct tape.
Henning hopes to bring hurling, the popular Irish sport, to USC, and if it takes some errands and a little money he is OK with that.
Import · Club president Brendan Henning has tried to extend the reach of the traditional Irish game of hurling to the USC campus by starting his own hurling club. - Larry Lin | Daily Trojan 
The piping is used to create goalposts, which he and his teammates affix above a soccer goal. Once the field is set, the players grab their equipment and start their match or practice.
Not many scrimage spectators — mainly those running on the track at Cromwell Field — know what they’re watching.
“Almost 100 percent of the time people see us out here, they say, ‘What the hell is this?’” said undecided freshman Pat Sebastian, one of the club’s 10 regular members.
It’s a worthwhile question.
Hurling is thought to have originated more than 2,000 years ago in Ireland, but it is less popular elsewhere. The sport is similar to field hockey and lacrosse, and at its higher levels can be remarkably violent.
Henning, who is one-fourth Irish, said he is happy to explain the sport to anyone who wants to come to the twice a week practices and occasional scrimmages. So far, he has about nine regular players. This is the club’s first year as a school-sanctioned sport, and recruitment has been slow. That’s partly because few people know what hurling is.
“In theory it sounds dumb,” Sebastian said. “I’m trying to explain: ‘We have this stick thing.’ But you can’t equate it to anything in America.”
The club members say the game is simple. Players usually advance the ball (called a sliotar and pronounced “slitter”) with hockey-style sticks called hurleys, though they can also kick the ball. If the sliotar is hit into the air, players can catch it and either hit it forward (like a baseball) or smack it with an open hand. Players score by shooting the ball in the net (three points) or by rocketing the sliotar through football-style uprights (one point).
On a recent Saturday evening, five USC players showed up to scrimmage with more advanced players from throughout California.
Coaching the players was Patrick Gallagher, a burly building contractor who emigrated from Ireland in 1994 and now acts as a hurling emissary in Los Angeles. The local Irish community is committed to growing the sport in the United States, Gallagher said, and much of the USC Hurling Club’s gear was donated by the community.
The club has 10 regular members and practices twice a week at the Intramural Field. - Larry Lin | Daily Trojan
“They are promoting our sport in the U.S.,” Gallagher said. “This is part of our future. They are keeping the game alive.”
Gallagher said he was once a top player “about 50 pounds ago.” His hands support his assertion. They are crooked and smattered with scars, the result of at least 30 stitches from hurling injuries. Some of the worst injuries, he said, happen when errant sticks hit players.
“It’s not a sport for the faint hearted, that’s for sure,” Gallagher said.
At this level though, the injuries are minor. Alec Winetrobe, a junior majoring in aerospace engineering, said his worst injuries have come from gripping the stick too hard. The team has not purchased helmets yet — a compulsory piece of equipment in Ireland — so the games are slow.
Still, the sport is not for everyone. Phillip Sanshuck, a 120-pound junior majoring in biochemistry and pyschology, chose to help the club by videotaping its games. Henning, a relentless promoter of his club, told Sanshuck more people might play if they see the sport on YouTube.
“He once tried to get me to join, but I know if I take one hit I’m down,” Sanshuck said. “I’d just break bones.”
So far, no one in the USC club has had stitches. And the players said they’re having a great time.
“You whack things with a stick,” Sebastian said. “That’s always fun.”

During the Great Depression, more people became millionaires than at any other time in U.S. history.
The counterintuitive reason is simple: Ambitious people could not get traditional jobs.
USC and the nation face an interesting problem. Unemployment is very high. Entry-level positions are slim. According to a study by BusinessWeek with data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the percentage of college graduates between age 22 and 27 with jobs has shrunk significantly during the past three years.
The USC Marshall Keenan MBA Career Resource Center has also reported experiencing similar decreases in employer recruitment.
Plenty of students and seniors are facing this issue, with graduation at hand and hardly any jobs to be found.
Yet many books on management and leadership talk about these kinds of situations. What do you do when you have a problem in a business? Change the way you think. Look at it as if it is an opportunity. Then embrace the opportunity and move forward.
During a recession or in times of economic turmoil, many things go awry. Businesses fail. Their capital assets (i.e., everything they own or use to make their products) lose value and become cheap because they are used and difficult to resell.  But these failed businesses need to sell these assets because they can no longer utilize it to make their product. Failed business owners want to squeeze even the slightest amount of cash out of these assets.
That’s where the people with unconventional approaches come in.
Rather than moping around jobless, the future millionaires look at this problem, get excited and buy up goods belonging to failed businesses.
In general, business start-up costs are much lower during a recession or any sort of downturn. The general intuition for this is as such: People have less cash, so they want to spend that on food and necessities and desire to spend less on a machine that makes boots  — a decrease in demand. People are not thinking to start businesses when companies around them are failing.
According to USA Today, 30 percent of non-franchise businesses fail in the first year. Fifty percent fail in the first five years. These failures usually come from two primary sources: the start-up managers are incompetent or the business just cannot overcome its high costs.
When the economy is booming, a start-up has high initial investment costs. But almost all start-ups are not profitable for one to two years. Businesses need to survive this unprofitable period to grow into something larger and highly profitable.
A business owner would be wise to have these unprofitable initial years coincide with the recessionary time, in anticipation of riding the upturn. This is especially true because many companies struggle through these difficult times, leaving them weak.
It is during this time that an owner can test and refine his business plan.
USC has a great history of entrepreneurial spirit. Many prominent businesses, such as the famous surf wear company Quiksilver, have been started by young and eager Trojan graduates. All it takes is a change in perception of the world mixed with a source of creativity and desire to do something productive.
May the word “problem” become synonymous with “opportunity” for us Trojans. Seniors without job prospects, I hope we can see this jobless time as an opportunity to start something fresh, something new.

Captain & Tennille sang, Love, love will keep us together, but let’s be honest — even lovers need to eat. In fact, food is one of the few things in this world that consistently brings people together regardless of age, gender, race, religion and opinion.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
This is never more evident than when reading the fliers that decorate campus —  “The Jesse M. Unruth Institute of Politics presents, Students Talk Back: Populism, Politics and Anger (free lunch provided),” the “USC Catholic Center presents, The Second Annual Sports and Spirituality Presentation (La Taquiza dinner buffet included)” and the “USC Environment First presents, My Own Two Feet Documentary Screening (event includes delicious food from Organic to Go)” — you get the point.
These organizations clearly understand that in order to ensure a significant turnout it helps to dangle a carrot (or a Mexican food buffet) in front of student noses, proving that the lyrics, Food, food will keep us together, perhaps ring more true.
This hypothesis might explain why campus is such a ghost town on the weekends. With very few dining options on Saturdays and Sundays, it’s no surprise that many students who live within a 60 mile radius make a pilgrimage back to Mom and Dad’s refrigerator each week.
Before continuing any further, I must acknowledge that in the past four years the university has done a magnificent job providing new food options for its students. When I look back on the Figueroa Street I knew my freshman year — the street my friends and I dubbed the Las Vegas strip of fast food — it’s amazing to see restaurants like McKay’s and The Lab replacing the previously dilapidated Sizzler. Café 84 has also been revamped to offer a plethora of menus capable of satisfying even the most particular palate.
The issue is no longer variety but rather availability. The proliferation of new dining destinations is great, but the fact that most of them are closed on the weekends is a problem. Other than Trojan Grounds, every specialty cafe on campus shuts down after Friday, along with most of Café 84 and The Lot. Even during the week, the majority of these vendors close at 5 p.m., which begs the question, where are students supposed to eat dinner?
I believe a solution to this problem would be the addition of a campus restaurant, which could be built to replace The Lot when the Ronald Tutor Campus Center is complete. Rather than a dining hall or food court landscape, the eatery could be an actual sit-down diner with a aura similar to that of the 29th Street Café — but located on campus and open past 5 p.m. seven days a week.
Most of us left high school with the hope that cafeteria discrimination would be a thing of the past, but when walking around USC at lunchtime, with Greeks grabbing a bite at their sorority and fraternity houses, athletes eating at the Galen Center and freshman grubbing at Everybody’s Kitchen, it seems this mantra still holds true. A campus restaurant would draw people away from their respective niches, thus creating a more unified student body.
Further, a new restaurant would provide additional jobs for both students and members of the community while simultaneously bringing in more revenue. Obviously the eatery would have to be built before any thought of profit becomes tangible, and a great way to fund this project would be to reach out to the Trojan alumni base. The incentive could be that those who donate to the new restaurant will have their face or a character of themselves painted on the wall — courtesy of Roski Fine Arts students perhaps? — giving donors a visual testament of their Trojan pride that will last for years to come.
In nature, one can always find the most diverse group of animals at the watering hole, and the same theory applies to humans. A campus restaurant that stayed open on the weekends would unite our diverse student body, thus ultimately furthering USC’s promise to provide us with a Trojan Family that lasts not four years but for life.

After speaking with his mother, Glenville High School senior safety Latwan Anderson has decided to cancel his official visit to USC Thursday and narrowed down his choices to two other colleges.
The Senate Athletic League’s Most Valuable Player from Cleveland is now deciding between West Virginia and Miami.
“This is beginning to wear on me and I just want to get this over with,” Anderson told the Cleveland Plain Dealer.
Anderson, who is 6 feet tall and weighs 195 pounds, gave a verbal commitment to WVU at the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in January, but delayed signing with the school so that he could visit USC before making his final decision.
“I’m disappointed with how the USC thing ended up, but I understand how my mom feels,” Anderson said. “We have family in Florida and if I choose Miami, they’ll be able to see me play more often than if I was in California.”
After transferring from St. Edward High School in 2009, Anderson played one season in Glenville where he recorded 45 tackles, three sacks, broke up five passes and made 11 interceptions.
Anderson, who called Miami and scheduled an official visit for this weekend after deciding against flying out to USC, hopes to make a decision sometime in the next two weeks.
He ranks as the 15th best player in the nation among all positions according to Rivals.com.

Local civil activists are filing a federal lawsuit against Proposition 209 on Tuesday in an attempt to give non-Asian minorities a better chance at admittance into California’s leading state schools.
Proposition 209 states in part that public universities “shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin”.
BAMN – The Coalition To Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight For Equality By Any Means Necessary — is challenging the law on the basis that Proposition 209 propagates a ‘racial caste system’.
Dovetailing with this claim is BAMN’s contention that the UC system places too much emphasis on grades and SAT/ACT scores, thereby disadvantaging students (mostly minorities) without access to sufficient high school education.
Despite past failures of civil action suits to abolish Prop 209, BAMN’s attorney feels confident that the fields of both law and education are now ripe for such a breakthrough.
Approximately 45 percent of California’s high school graduates consist of non-asian minorities -predominately Latinos, blacks, and Native Americans.  By contrast, the same racial groups make up less than 20% of the student body at universities such as UC-Berkeley and UCLA.
Similar to the circumstances under which Prop 209 was implemented in California in 1996, Michigan  passed Proposal 2 by a slim majority in 2006. Proposal 2 effectively bans affirmative action in several Michigan state schools, despite past allowances of race as an admission factor.
In 2003, the Supreme Court ruled that the law school at the University of Michigan may constitutionally engage in affirmative action as long as no racial quotas were involved.
Outside of BAMN, organizations against Prop 209 in California include ACLU of Southern California, Feminist Majority and California Votes NO! On 209.
Oh wow, I remember that. I voted for it in my first election, when I was 19. The challengers seem to be arguing that we need to institute a “racial caste system” in order to prevent the propagation of a racial caste system. Racism is an abhorrent philosophy, and I think that for liberals to take up this issue seriously undermines their credibility.

After starting with a 3-1 record after the first week of play, USC (3-4) dropped all three games in the Dodgertown Classic over the weekend, including Sunday’s non-conference game against its crosstown rival.
Against UCLA (6-0), the Trojans weren’t able to get runs across early in the game.
USC stranded runners on third base in each of the first two innings and had a runner gunned down at the plate in the fourth inning when junior Matt Hart tried to tag up and score on a fly ball to left field.
“When we have guys in scoring position and on third base, we need to put the ball in play,” junior Joe De Pinto said. “We need to hit. That’s the bottom line.”
USC put the first run on the scoreboard in the fifth inning when Cade Kreuter and Mike O’Neill hit back-to-back doubles, but the lead was short lived. UCLA tied the ball game up in the bottom half of the inning when Brett Krill doubled home Cody Keefer.
After his bullpen threw 10 1/3 innings in the first two games of the weekend, coach Chad Kreuter was hoping not to have to use his relievers early. But Bruin Steve Rodriguez’s line drive in the second inning nicked senior starting pitcher Kevin Couture’s pitching hand before hitting him squarely on his upper leg.
Couture stayed in the game for two pitches, but called the trainers out when he started bleeding and had trouble gripping the baseball. Kreuter said Couture would have an X-ray on his thumb Monday to assess the injury.
Sophomore Ben Mount replaced Couture and gave the team 4 1/3 solid innings, allowing only two runs.
“Mount stepped up big time,”  Kreuter said of the tough-luck loser. “But that really killed our bullpen when Couture had to go out.”
With the game tied 1-1 in the seventh inning, Mount left after throwing nearly 100 pitches, but Justin Uribe’s single up the middle later in the inning drove in a pair of UCLA runners. The Bruins tacked on three insurance runs in the next inning, including Niko Gallego’s blast off Shuhei Fujiya over the San Manuel Indian Bingo & Casino advertisement in left-centerfield for a home run.
USC finished with seven hits, including a pair by O’Neill.
The Trojans’ weekend started with an extra inning affair Friday night when they fell to Oklahoma State 6-4 in 11 innings at Dedeaux Field. After falling behind 4-0, USC scored a pair of runs in the eighth and ninth innings capped off by a two-run double by De Pinto to tie the game and give fans some free baseball.
But Oklahoma State centerfielder Dusty Harvard delivered the go-ahead single in the 11th inning off Fujiya to help give the Cowboys the 6-4 victory. Harvard also produced the most spectacular catch of the young college baseball season earlier in the game when he made a full-extension dive while sprinting deep into the left-centerfield gap.
On Saturday, USC fell 10-1 to Vanderbilt on a soggy Dedeaux Field. Much like the UCLA game, the Trojans scored first but couldn’t execute with runners on base to build to the lead.
“Two nights in a row we had opportunities to score early runs,” Kreuter said after Sunday’s contest. “And those runs could have been scored with ground balls.”
Sophomore Chad Smith didn’t make it through the fifth inning for his second consecutive start. He cruised through the first four innings but fell apart in the fifth.
Smith hit the first two batters and allowed a double and a walk before being removed from the game. All four hitters would come around to score.
Vanderbilt added three runs in each of the next two innings to turn what had looked like a pitcher’s duel early on into a blowout.
USC will return to the diamond Tuesday when they travel to Long Beach State to take on the Dirtbags at 6:30 p.m.
“We just need to come back and battle Tuesday and hopefully get on a little roll,” Couture said. “Our starters are doing well. We just need to work on our relief pitching.”

Palin, Kardashian, Jersey Shore cast booked for Leno’s homecoming
Jay Leno’s much anticipated return to The Tonight Show will include quite a variety of guests and performers. The homecoming is attracting a large amount of interest among viewers and will garner an A-list line-up of guests.
Tonight, his first night back in the 11:30 timeslot, Leno sits down with Jamie Foxx and Olympic Gold Medal Skier Lindsey Vonn, plus a musical performance by Brad Paisley. The two-week line-up, released by NBC last week, includes other A-listers like Sarah Palin, Olympic Star Snowboarder Shaun White, Chelsea Handler and Matthew McConaughey, as well as the cast from MTV’s Jersey Shore (who is also scheduled to make an appearance on The View later this month). A performance by controversial live TV performer Adam Lambert is still in the works for Tuesday night.
Leno is returning to The Tonight Show after an unsuccessful shift to a prime time talk show. He is reclaiming the show from Conan O’Brien who left when NBC tried to move him back to his original midnight timeslot. The New York Times reported that O’Brien received a $45 million settlement from NBC to get him out of his contract earlier this year.
Precious wins big at 41st Image Awards
If you noticed tons of limos and people in black-tie attire on campus Friday, they weren’t coming to USC. They were headed across Jefferson Street to the Shine Auditorium for the 41st Annual NAACP Awards.
I did attend both the VIP Pre-Reception on Thursday evening at Milk Studio in Hollywood and the awards show on Friday broadcast live on FOX.  The reception, which was an intimate relaxed evening for the celebrities and guests to mingle, featured stars including Sherri Shepherd, Idris Elba, Donnie McClurkin, Denise Boutter, Keith Robinson, Eva Marcell with new beau Lance Gross and LaLa Vasquez. I spotted The View’s Sherri Shepherd and her husband along with Tracie Ellis Ross, from hit sitcom Girlfriends, having a great time dancing to Beyonce’s Single Ladies with partygoers in the studio-turned dancefloor.
At the award show the next night, Precious won six Image Awards including best picture, director, screenplay, lead and supporting actress. The film is competing in all those categories at next week’s Oscars. I did get to talk to Xosha Roquemore about her role in Precious alongside Gabourey Sidibe. Roquemore played Sidibe’s classmate, Joann (who’s favorite color was fluorescent beige).
“It was great being on set with Gabby during taping,” said Roquemore. “That’s my homegirl and I know she’s going to do her thing at the Oscars next week!”
The show consisted of appearances and presentations by many black celebritie elites including Tyler Perry, who accepted the Chairman’s award, Monique’, Chris Rock, Maxwell, Nick Cannon, Gabrielle Union, Tichina Arnold. Cicely Tyson and Morgan Freedman. John Legend, Kerri Hilson, Mary-Mary and Tamela Mann performed during the event.
Sandra Bullock also attended the event for her best actress nomination for her role in The Blind Side. She received many positive comments on her dress during the evening, even one on stage from host Anika Noni Rose joking, “Sandra Bullock, your dress is bad, girl!”
USC student Devan Bratton, who works for SeatFillers.com, got to sit next to Bullock for almost half the show on the front row. Many students watching the broadcast noticed Bratton on TV sitting right next to Bullock during the show. “She was very nice to me and talked to me a lot during the show,” said Bratton.
Osmond son commits suicide, leaves note for friend
Marie Osmond’s son died here in Los Angeles Friday night after jumping from his eighth floor apartment. In a note he left for “his only close friend in Los Angeles,” he said he intended to commit suicide after a life-long battle with depression. Osmond pulled out of her performance with her brother Donny at the Flamingo in Las Vegas on Saturday night after hearing the devastating news.
Michael Blosili, 18, was a student at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, the school on the LA season of Project Runway and The Hills. Blosili had been battling depression for many years. In 2007, at age 16, he went to rehab for undisclosed reasons. His mom, Marie, was hospitalized in 2006 for an alleged attempted suicide. She quickly denied the claim after the National Enquirer published the story.
He, along with other members of the Osmond family, was seen publicly on the Osmond special on The Oprah Show last year. TMZ.com reported that The Los Angeles Police Department has launched an investigation into Blosili’s death and an autopsy has been scheduled.
Ne-Yo arrested? In Norway?
I never thought I would hear of R&B singer Ne-Yo coming within 50 feet of men fighting with guns and knives. Contrary to my belief, that’s what happened this weekend in Norway with Ne-Yo and his crew.
After a show in Oslo, Norway, Ne-Yo and his ‘boys’ attended an after party where they were drinking and dancing in a club’s VIP section. The club’s security was called to the scene because of a massive fight that broke out close to their private section. YBF.com is reporting that Ne-Yo and his crew were allegedly throwing fists and kicks. A Norwegian newspaper published that one of Ne-Yo’s crewmembers punched someone in the face and “blood was everywhere.”
When the fight broke up, the singer and his crew tried to leave the club, but another fight broke out in the street. The police detained Ne-Yo and a few a members of his crew outside as they tried to leave the second fight. Reports do not specify whether Ne-Yo was officially arrested or just detained.
