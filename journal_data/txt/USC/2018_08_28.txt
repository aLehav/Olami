The Board of Trustees has appointed a 23-person committee to aid in the selection of the University’s next president, Chair of the Board Rick Caruso announced Tuesday, raising concerns among student leaders about the lack of student representation. 
The committee comprises faculty, trustees, the School of Cinematic Arts dean and the interim president, Wanda Austin. No students were selected for the committee.
“The Board recognizes that selecting our next president is not only historic and consequential, but it is also our most inviolable and solemn fiduciary obligation,” Chairman Rick Caruso wrote in Tuesday’s letter to the USC community. “This is a monumental moment for the future of our University and we commit to this undertaking with the utmost faith, trust and confidence.”
The announcement followed a meeting between student leaders and Caruso  this summer, and a newsletter from Graduate Student Government President Joycelyn Yip sent to grad students on Monday. In the newsletter, Yip shared that GSG has “persistently requested that there be student representation within decision-making bodies.”
“The Board has denied us a seat at the table,” Yip wrote, explaining that universities like Stanford, Princeton and NYU have included students on similar committees. “The Board of Trustees has voted to exclude students and staff on the Presidential Search Advisory Committee this fall.” 
Yip revealed that the Undergraduate Student Government and GSG both requested that the committee include two student members — one graduate and one undergraduate — to represent USC’s student population of over 45,000.  
USG President Debbie Lee confirmed the governing bodies’ request.
Emily Smith | Daily TrojanSearching for a president · USG President Debbie Lee was one of the student leaders who met with Board of Trustees Chair Rick Caruso about student representation on the search committee.
“I think it’s imperative that administrators realize that student voices aren’t just a check mark on the qualifications — [that they’re] a priority,” Lee said. “There needs to a clear and direct channel where students are actively engaging and participating in Board decisions because at the end of the day, their decision affects all of us.” 
Caruso told the Daily Trojan that the Board did not vote to exclude anybody and that the voice of students was “critically important,” but also that the Board can’t have “an unlimited amount of people” participating.
“Quite frankly, this is a difficult process to get through,” Caruso said. “We think it’s well representative of the faculty, of the deans and the trustees.” 
Caruso said in his letter that the faculty representatives were recommendations from the Academic Senate, along with the inclusion of Yaniv Bar-Cohen, the president of the Academic Senate, who expressed his optimism with the presidential search process.
“In terms of qualities we are looking for in a new president, the most important thing for the search committee to do right now is to listen as best we can to the members of the USC community to answer that question,” Bar-Cohen wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan, stating that he had nothing to add regarding the exclusion of students on the committee. 
“The voice of the students is critically important and we’re going to listen to their voice through the town sessions that we’ll have,” Caruso said. 
In his letter to the USC community, Caruso stated that anyone can access a presidential search website to submit recommendations and nominations for the new president.
He also explained that students and other members of the community are welcome to attend one of three town hall-style “listening sessions” where people can share recommendations and opinions regarding the search. The first meeting is set for Sept. 13 at Town and Gown.
Kristopher Coombs, former president and a current vice president of GSG, said that concerns about student representation during major decision-making processes are not new. According to Coombs, students advocated for representation at the trustee level weeks before the presidential search. 
“Every time we brought up having a permanent student representative, who basically had voting power, they were very dismissive about that idea, or very vague about it,” Coombs said.
Caruso explained that the Board’s Governance Committee is currently looking into ways to restructure the Board, with a decision expected by the beginning of 2019.
“There’s no doubt that we need greater diversity at the Board level, and that is one of my primary goals,” Caruso said. “We need more diversity in terms of men and women of color and ethnic backgrounds.” 
Hours after the announcement regarding the committee, a Change.org petition began circulating on social media, led by USG leader Christopher McMorran.
“The Board of Trustees has made it clear that the oices of wealthy donors and elite members of the University are valued over the voices of their own students,” the petition read. “If USC is to achieve the culture change it so badly needs, this is unacceptable.”
The petition garnered a few dozen signatures by time publication.

Former state legislator Sebastian Ridley-Thomas has accused USC of violating his rights as a student by disclosing private information to the media, the latest development in a string of controversies surrounding the Dworak-Peck School of Social Work and Ridley-Thomas.
The accusation follows reports from the Los Angeles Times that Ridley-Thomas, a former member of the state Assembly, was hired as a professor and given a scholarship to pursue his master’s degree at the University, while a $100,000 donation from his father, a prominent local politician, was funneled from USC to a think tank led by Ridley-Thomas.
In a letter dated Aug. 8 obtained by the Daily Trojan, Ridley-Thomas’ attorney Lance Olson alleged that a USC staff member disclosed the former legislator’s status as a student, scholarship and financial aid information to the Times.
Olson wrote that the Times “appeared to have been given information that is personally identifiable”  to Ridley-Thomas and that he had never authorized the release of that information, including the fact that Ridley-Thomas had been interviewed by the University’s Office of Compliance.
“Of particular concern is the fact the Times was clearly told of the Compliance Office interview of my client,” Olson wrote. “That information could only have come from one of the three persons from USC who participated in the interview.”
USC declined to comment on the contents of the letter. However, in a statement to the Daily Trojan earlier this month, Chairman of the Board of Trustees Rick Caruso said he was “disturbed and concerned” by the allegations against Ridley-Thomas. 
“The University disclosed this matter promptly to the United States Attorney’s Office and is cooperating with them,” Caruso said about donation questions.
The Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act, a law passed in 1974, states that schools receiving federal funding “must have written permission from the parent or eligible student in order to release any information from a student’s education record.”
However, the law also suggests that schools have permission to disclose, without consent, directory information such as student names, addresses and honors and awards, but that they must also provide a “reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose directory information about them.”
The letter from Ridley-Thomas’ attorney comes after a slew of stories from the Times regarding the former legislator’s resignation from the state Assembly and his role at the University.
The Times reported earlier this month that following his resignation from the state Assembly due to medical concerns, Ridley-Thomas joined the School of Social Work faculty, while also pursuing his master’s degree at the same school under a full-tuition scholarship.
During this time, the Times reported that his father, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, made a $100,000 donation from his campaign fund to the School of Social Work, which was later funneled to a think tank unaffiliated with USC and led by  his son Sebastian Ridley-Thomas.
“We do not believe that it raises any legal or ethical issues, and it had nothing to do with his son’s scholarship or employment at the University,” Mark Ridley-Thomas’ attorney Stephen Kaufman said in a statement to the Daily Trojan earlier this month.
Following the disclosure of this transaction, USC put former School of Social Work dean Marilyn Flynn on leave, fired Sebastian Ridley-Thomas and forwarded the details about the donation to a federal agency.
Sebastian Ridley-Thomas still appears as a student of the School’s online degree program in the USC directory but does not appear as a faculty member.
The Times also reported that Sebastian Ridley-Thomas had been under investigation for sexual harassment when he stepped down from the Assembly and joined USC’s administration. A source told the Times that USC was unaware of this investigation when it hired the former legislator.

The Feminist Involvement Fair, organized by the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, listed over 42 organizations, including Planned Parenthood L.A., Global Women’s Narrative Project and Women in Cinematic Arts. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Gender empowerment flooded McCarthy Quad on Monday during the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment’s Feminist Involvement Fair. 
The SAGE Executive Co-Director Rosa Wang, a junior majoring in sociology, said she helped spark the fair because she felt SAGE needed a “feminist mission.”
“Since there were so many allegations, so many scandals happening in USC, we really needed to push the focus on feminist missions,” Wang said. “We really wanted to create a whole feminist involvement fair.” 
The forum listed over 42 organizations, including groups such as Planned Parenthood LA., Global Women’s Narrative Project and Women in Cinematic Arts. 
The event also featured Expanding Male Engagement in Reproductive and Gender Equity, an organization that participates in research of male engagement in reproduction, whether it be research into male infertility or contraception. Student members of this organization carried signs at the fair, calling for an increase of male participation in the birth control conversation. 
Initially, the event featured only 25 organizations, but Wang said other groups reached out to SAGE after the Facebook event page circulated online. One of the groups added later was the Sex Workers Outreach Project, a group dedicated to ending the surrounding stigma and ensuring fundamental rights for sex workers. 
Wang hopes that with its presence, SWOP will allow the community to integrate with the University environment and for organizations to interact with one another as well.
“We initially wanted some sort of space for our member organizations to have a forum to mingle with one another,” said SAGE executive co-director Anya Kushwaha.
Leeanna Albanese attended the event as events coordinator of Artemis, an intersectional community based on creativity. She said that her organization benefited from the organization by meeting others with similar missions. 
“We already talked to a couple of other tables about doing [projects] together,” Albanese said. “Working with other people is what we do.”
Looking ahead, Wang said she hopes to expand the event to multiple days and include speakers and a mini-concert. The next fair is scheduled for the spring of 2019.

When MRI scans are taken, technology automatically splits the data into different sections, often resulting in errors that must be fixed manually. The process of correcting these errors is tedious and time consuming, in addition to teaching students how to do so. 
The Keck School of Medicine has developed a solution to this problem — a new technology called Virtual Brain Segmenter. 
VBS uses virtual reality features to decipher errors in brain scan data more effectively, instead of relying on computer programs to complete the same task.
“People who had never interacted with MRI data were really excited about the tool,” said Dominique Duncan, an assistant professor of neurology at Keck. “And many commented that it already felt like a game and that they’d love to spend their free time using the tool.”
The idea for this technology was conceived when Duncan was working in one of the neuroimaging labs teaching student volunteers to correct errors in MRI data.
She noticed that students did not like the work, so she decided to create a solution using technology from electronic company HTC’s Vive, a virtual reality headset.
“I was excited when we reached a point where it actually worked, because developing it took some time,” Duncan said. “I loved seeing people’s reactions when they tried it and enjoyed using it.” 
Duncan explained that the new technology allows users to zoom in and out of data with ease, while making it easier for them to concentrate on a set of data. A small-size experiment revealed that using the VBS technology saved users 68 seconds when finding data errors in MRI scans, according to USC News. 
“It just brings you closer to the data, helping you to better understand its spatial relationships and to provide an intuitive understanding of what goes with what,” said Arthur Toga, director of USC’s Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute. 
Now, Duncan plans to work with three L.A. high schools to continue testing VBS before crowdsourcing.
“There are many things that will continue to improve the process, the interface [and] the presentation,” Toga said.
Duncan hopes that VBS will become so intuitive and user-friendly that non-experts can assist with correcting errors.
“As soon as we implement a few extra features, we plan to focus on crowdsourcing this tool and [have] it used by a wide audience around the world,” Duncan said.

Rev. Richard Sunwoo was named pastor of Our Savior Parish after serving as an administrator for two years. His installment mass was celebrated on Sunday with Bishop Edward Clark. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
Cloaked in white vestments and eyes lost in prayerful concentration, Rev. Richard Sunwoo’s posture was humble as he was presented with symbols of his new pastoral office: the lectionary to remind him to always be a faithful preacher, sacred chrism and oil of the sick for anointing and the sacred chalice and ciborium as a sign of desire for him to serve the eucharist to the parish.
 “To be a pastor is a great responsibility,” said Bishop Edward Clark as he addressed the parishioners at Sunwoo’s installation mass at Our Savior Parish on Sunday. “It is a responsibility that is filled with many joys, but also with some anxieties.”
After two years serving as administrator of USC’s Catholic church Our Savior Parish, Sunwoo has now been named pastor of the parish. In his new position, he will be the designated priest overseeing the church for the next six years.
“I think today is really about celebrating Father Richard, but more importantly I think for the USC community having a leader who’s authentic, who’s genuine, who’s caring,” said Jamie Cappetta, president of the USC Caruso Catholic Center. “Especially in these difficult times in our church, he is an authentic kind of shepherd of his flock.”
Though his daily responsibilities will not change, Sunwoo is now specifically responsible for parishioners at USC.
“We have a unique opportunity to be the face of the young church in America,” Sunwoo said. “All of our parishioners are young. I don’t have the old lady in the corner saying that’s not how my monsignor used to do it … l really want to make sure that the faith is alive, vibrant and relevant to all of our young college students.” 
Upon entering as an administrator, he initially focused on ensuring that students knew he was supportive and demonstrating to students that the faith is still present and relevant. Now, he is focusing on discipleship by providing opportunities for students to encounter Christ through retreats, service projects, prayer meetings and community gatherings.
Sunwoo, a former high school teacher, has returned to working with young people as Pastor of Our Savior Parish. (Emily Smith | Daily Trojan)
“From that powerful encounter, they’ll want to learn more so that process changes our hearts and when our hearts are changed that’s when we are galvanized to change the world and make it a positive difference,” Sunwoo said. “Whether you’re Protestant or Catholic or searching or whatever it may be, we want this place to be where people can encounter Christ and … be changed by the beautiful message.” 
Sunwoo, who was a high school teacher before being ordained in 2009, finds himself once again immersed among young people but in a different way.
“I’m not here to judge people for what they can produce,” Sunwoo said. “That’s the beauty of it. That’s so different for me. I love young people. What I hated was grading them.” 
Sunwoo’s involvement at USC has extended further than the Caruso Catholic Center. He attends both home and away football games to pray with players before games.
“I think the message is that religion is used to divide the world, but I believe it’s the opposite. It’s the only self; it’s the medicine that brings healing to brokenness,” Sunwoo said. 
When Sunwoo, who previously served at Saint Florence Martyr Catholic Church in Redondo Beach, Calif. for five years and at Saint Monica Catholic Church in Santa Monica, Calif. for two years, applied to  the pastorship at Our Savior, he went through an extensive recommendation process. Students, the advisory board and some parishioners filled out evaluations about Sunwoo’s character, contribution to the parish and challenges they’ve observed, which the bishop then reviewed. 
“I think Archbishop [Jose] Gomez and Bishop Clark made a great decision,” Cappetta said. “Much of our community is nonwhite, much of our community, USC, is an incredibly diverse place and so to have somebody as the leader of this community with his background … now here leading other students on their journey of faith — that’s pretty powerful.”

Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
People say that college is the best four years of their lives. For many new students, it is their first time living away from home. It is a time dedicated to exploring interests, meeting new people from all walks of life and learning how to live in the real world. During these years, students learn how to balance tough coursework, clubs, activities and social events. All of these new opportunities thrust upon freshmen can be intimidating and easily overwhelming, something the University recognized when it introduced deferred rush. 
Deferred rush was implemented this fall, in an attempt to improve student life. This rule prevents students from rushing a Greek organization before completing at least 12 units while maintaining a 2.5 minimum GPA. The administration thought this would improve campus life by allowing students to focus on coursework and adapt to college for a semester. However, not all students need to have their hands held by the University and can manage their own time effectively. Students who are able to handle Greek rush in their first semester at USC should not be deprived of the opportunity.
The implementation of deferred rush at USC is not an adequate solution to improving freshman life across campus. Rather, this poorly-executed attempt to get students to focus on academics fails to acknowledge the potentially negative effects of any of the other time-consuming activities on USC’s campus. If the University was truly trying to urge freshmen to focus on coursework for their first semester, the Student Affairs office should have enacted a requirement for students to complete a semester before joining any club or organization. 
Greek houses are beneficial environments for new students  particularly for a variety of reasons. Being a member of a fraternity or sorority allows students to network professionally and socially, all while creating bonds that will last a lifetime. Greek organizations highly value academic success; it would greatly jeopardize the reputation of a fraternity or sorority if they were to ever require a member to forgo their coursework for a Greek event. 
Those who pledge are often the most driven students on campus. At USC, 1,948 fraternity members are each involved in more than two organizations, while 806 members are leaders of campus organizations. Furthermore, USC’s Greek life is overwhelmingly recognized for its academic, philanthropic, athletic and social achievements. In the last year, USC Greek life collectively donated nearly $200,000 to various charities and spent just under 30,000 combined hours volunteering. 
The administration believes that Greek life has significant drawbacks for first semester freshmen because rushing is time-consuming and could lead to students not making school their first priority. However, that same logic could be applied to groups like the marching band, sports teams and Trojan Knights. Joining these take up as much or more time in a freshman’s schedule as rushing does, but these organizations have been unaffected by the University’s futile attempt to help students focus on coursework by deferring rush. This reasoning is evidence to believe that the University has a deeper grievance with Greek life and is attempting to mask that with a weak excuse instead.
The decision to go Greek as a first semester student can be tough. Students can often forget their priorities and put their social lives ahead of their school work. However, college is a time when young people become adults; it is the individual’s responsibility to govern their time management, not the University’s. Moreover, if students become overwhelmed they have the liberty to drop and decide that Greek life isn’t right for them or rush during a later semester.
The way USC Student Affairs implemented deferred rush was reckless and significantly affected the finances of Greek houses. Deferred rush was implemented with very little warning which didn’t allow houses adequate time to properly manage their finances for this major loss in membership. 
Member dues are one of the largest sources of income for houses; each sorority member pays between $2,000 and $3,000 per semester while fraternity members pay slightly less. Fraternities and sororities expect to recoup the financial loss from members who graduate each semester through the incoming pledge class. A better alternative on the University’s part would have been to alert the fraternities of the new rules at least a year in advance or allow for a transitional period. 
Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry and his office should reconsider their decision to limit the opportunities that freshmen have to join social organizations. The resolution should be an absolute decision to either prevent freshmen from joining any organization or allow them to be adults and make their own life choices. The choice to target Greek life specifically is wrong and is indicative of the prejudice the University has against Greek organizations.

In June, the California legislature finalized a plan that will encourage community colleges to confer degrees to students and allow them to transfer to four-year colleges by withholding funding from low-performing community colleges. 
This is a flawed plan for three major reasons. First, encouraging community colleges to graduate students who are not ready for four year colleges is not feasible. Second, if a community college really is unable to move its students through the transfer process successfully, it does not make sense for the government to take away resources from that school rather than try to help it. Third, the plan fails to understand that not all community college students have the goal of transferring to a four-year institution. 
Prior to this plan, community colleges would receive state funding based on the number of students they enrolled. This is a logical approach: Provide community colleges resources based on the number of students in their system because all students deserve access to the same resources from the state. From the state’s perspective, everyone is provided with an equal opportunity. 
Supporters of the plan, which was spearheaded by former Los Angeles community college trustee and Gov. Jerry Brown, say that it will promote competition among community colleges, ensuring that only the best will be funded by the government. But this only encourages community colleges to lower their academic standards to graduate more students.
If Brown is so set on putting this plan into action he must have schools track the potential grade inflation this new policy will surely cause. The California Legislative Analyst’s Office proposed this back in February, when Brown’s plan had just been released.
Based on data tracking grade inflation country-wide, community colleges are the only group of schools that have not been more lenient in awarding grades. At four-year colleges, GPAs are rising at the rate of 0.1 points per decade, as they have been for the past 30 years. The most common grade awarded by four-year and two-year college campuses is an A, with 42 percent of all students supposedly earning that grade. 
At four-year schools, the rate at which top grades are being awarded has been going up roughly five to six percentage points each decade and are three times more common than they were in 1960. While the percentage of D and F grades at four-year colleges has been stable in recent years, the increase in the percentage of A grades is associated with fewer B and C grades, an Inside Higher Ed survey reveals. 
In recent years, the distribution of the A grade has gone down in recent years.But with California’s plan, that could change. As Jim Mahler, president of California’s Community College Council said, these two-year colleges will become mere “diploma mills” if given financial incentive to graduate more students. 
This could result in the admission and enrollment of students who are not qualified for four-year institutions. The last thing California needs is to send unqualified students to college and force mountains of debt on them only to see them struggle and find themselves unemployed with no way to pay it back. 
The plan also makes little sense. As it reads, if a college does a poor job graduating students and preparing them for four-year college, the state will withhold resources. It would make far more sense to help that school improve by granting it more resources instead.
Finally, the plan overlooks the students who enter college with no degree objective. A number of high school students take community college classes to fulfill their course requirements, in addition to students who take courses for an associate’s degree or for no degree at all. These students still deserve to reap the benefits of their local community college. 
While the new funding plan is expected to pass in California’s new budget, one can hope that lawmakers will realize the fallacies in their premises and the flaws in their projected goals. Nobody knows how long the plan will remain in action, but one thing is expected: There will be many more transfer students with perfect GPAs in California schools in the next few years.

In his new comedy project, Sacha Baron Cohen collaborated with Nathan Fielder to bring viewers “Who is America?” The Showtime series sees Cohen dress up as different characters to interview political figures and private citizens about controversial issues. (Photo from IMDb)
From notorious comedians Sacha Baron Cohen and Nathan Fielder, “Who Is America?” is a show that leaves no one unscathed. The Showtime series, whose finale aired  Aug. 26, has succeeded in revealing the faults of the United States and Americans, albeit in an absolutely hilarious way. Despite Cohen’s comedic success, however, the show’s backlash prevented it from receiving a second season. 
From public figures to the general populace, the thoughts and statements that Cohen has managed to pull out of his guests during interviews are borderline appalling. Cohen has managed to do it with only one lawsuit slapped  for defamation against him. 
While Cohen is known for controversial films such as “Borat” and “Bruno,” Fielder has found success through his cringe-comedy show “Nathan for You”; both of which set the premise of duping people as a means of entertainment. The schemes have varied from harmless 
interviews to borderline ridiculous requests, but people generally comply. The format for “Who Is America?” is no different. 
A twisted version of journalist Lisa Ling’s “Our America,” “Who Is America?” finds a costumed Cohen interviewing and tricking guests who are willing to say and do morally questionable things for the sake of appearing on television. While there were a few notable guests who stood up and walked away from the incredulity of it all, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders, there were also a number of guests who went along with the unfathomable ideas that Cohen’s characters would propose. 
It is almost painfully cringe-worthy to watch “Who Is America?” to see not only the extent to which some people will misbehave in order to be on television, but also to see the ridiculous reactions that others have to Cohen’s characters when he tests his experiments on unsuspecting citizens as opposed to public figures. 
After the series aired, many interviewees’ careers were either ended or severely tarnished. One notable moment in the sixth episode involves Cohen pretending to be an ex-convict-turned-chef who invited food critic Bill Jilla to dine at his fake restaurant. The episode  featured outlandish dishes like ground meat wrapped in a condom to a pièce de résistance where Cohen managed to convince Jilla to eat “human” meat. 
While the meat wasn’t actually human, Jilla seemed to have fully believed it was and even went so far as to thank the Chinese family who supplied the flesh for the dish. After the episode aired, Jilla removed himself from Facebook and deleted his website. 
Another notable episode included a politician from Georgia. Former state lawmaker Jason Spencer submitted his intent to resign immediately after the episode’s release, one in which Spencer repeatedly shouted the N-word in a fake exercise. The exercise was meant to teach Spencer how to “thwart” an ISIS kidnapping attempt by provoking the assailant. Through Cohen’s coaching, Spencer pulled his pants down at Cohen’s suggestion that ISIS members fear contact with buttocks, believing it will turn them homosexual. 
The “Who Is America?” guests were wide and varied: from private citizens like those of Kingman, Ariz. who reacted with incredibly racist remarks to Cohen’s proposal to idea of build a mosque (despite its potential to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars), to reality stars like Corinne Olympios from “The Bachelor,” who was convinced to propagate the funding of child soldiers. 
The best and worst of America is revealed in Cohen’s show, and it is unlikely that Cohen will get a second season given the backlash, as well as how difficult it would be to find other guests to fall for his stunt once again. 
In the season finale, the biggest shock to the audience and to the guests may not have been the segments that aired, but those that didn’t. Cohen had interviewed Sen. Sarah Palin and, in anticipation of the fallout, Palin outed herself on social media about the interview and how Cohen duped her in order to try and deflect the impending damages from the interview. 
However, the segment with Palin did not air with the last episode and therefore the Alaskan senator essentially shot herself in the foot — which was surely Cohen’s intention as the show ends with a special credit naming Palin. 
However uncomfortable “Who Is America?” makes its viewers, it is truly a brilliant piece of work that reveals not only the moral lines people will cross to be on television, but also the inner psyches of America’s most commonplace communities.
