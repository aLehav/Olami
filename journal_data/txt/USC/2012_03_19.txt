Over the past eight days, Frank Cruz and the USC baseball team played six games, winning three and losing three.
The Trojans lost a doubleheader to Utah on Friday which was the culmination of a three-game losing streak that started Tuesday night, when the Trojans fell to No. 9 UCLA at Dodger Stadium.
On Sunday, the Trojans took the field trying to avoid a sweep at the hands of Utah to open the Pac-12 season.
And the Trojans played one of their most complete games of the season to end spring break on a high note.
The Trojans bested the Utes 10-5 on Sunday in a display of offensive fury. Every Trojan starter had at least one hit, and six delivered multi-hit performances. All told, USC put up 18 in the H column, its best of the season.
The offensive prowess was especially welcomed following the Trojans dismal showing in a doubleheader on Friday. In the first game of the doubleheader, senior pitcher Andrew Triggs went the full nine innings, striking out 11 and walking just one.
But USC was shut out on just three hits as Triggs took a hard-luck loss. In the nightcap, USC jumped out 1-0 in the first inning, but didn’t score again and fell 3-1.
That loss snapped a five-game win streak the Trojans had been on. The last three of those came at the beginning of spring break, when USC played one of their most thrilling series of the season against Cal State Bakersfield.
On Friday and Saturday, the Trojans were down one entering the bottom of the ninth. And both nights, they tied the game and won in walk-off fashion. Friday it was sophomore third baseman Kevin Swick with the game-winning hit; Saturday it was junior second baseman Adam Landecker; on Sunday it was freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley who was the game’s MVP, going eight shutout innings, with 10 strikeouts and no walks to improve his ERA to 2.28.
The Trojans will travel to Palo Alto on Saturday to take on No. 2 Stanford in a three-game series.
Tough stretch really begins this weekend with three at Stanford ending Monday, a game Wednesday at
home with LMU or Pepperdine, and then back on the road with three up in Pullman, Wa. with WSU
beginning Friday. Man do your homework, actually played seven games recently in ten days going four
wins and three losses although didn’t leave southern California for any of them.

Despite some stiff competition, USC men’s tennis continues to build on its undefeated season and its long-standing win streak.
The No. 1 Trojans (18-0) took on their sixth top-10 opponent in No. 10 Florida (9-6) and extended their win streak to 38 dual matches with a 6-1 win over the Gators Monday at Marks Tennis Stadium.
Leading the way was No. 2 senior Steve Johnson, who tallied his 51st straight singles victory and USC’s first singles point with a 6-1, 6-2 win over No. 61 Bob van Overbeek.

“I’m playing some of my best tennis right now,” Johnson said. “I feel like there’s another level I can get to, mentally and physically, and that’s what I keep striving for.”
After Johnson’s win, freshman Roberto Quiroz pushed the Trojans’ lead to 3-0 by ousting Billy Federhofer 6-2, 6-3.
Fellow freshman Yannick Hanfmann, ranked No. 30 in singles, then clinched USC’s victory by defeating Florent Diep 7-5, 6-2. The return home helped Hanfmann bounce back from his three-set singles loss to Texas A&M’s John Lewis March 1.
“It’s always different at a home match,” Hanfmann said. “We’re all fired up to play at home.”
A loss from No. 41 sophomore Emilio Gomez to No. 93 Spencer Newman gave the Gators their only point for the match. Afterward, three-set wins from No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen and No. 24 sophomore Ray Sarmiento rounded out USC’s 6-1 victory.
Before singles action, USC had jumped out to an early 1-0 advantage with a sweep in doubles play.
The three doubles pairs from Florida were all nationally ranked, but the Trojans swept the field, beginning with Johnson and Quiroz’s 8-1 win over the No. 8 pair Federhofer and Nassim Slilam.
Gomez and Hanfmann followed with an 8-3 victory over No. 74 van Overbeek and Andrew Butz to clinch the doubles point for USC and improve their record together to 10-1.
Nguyen and Sarmiento, ranked No. 21 in the nation, finished the doubles sweep by taking out No. 26 Newman and Tripper Carleton 8-2.
Though the Trojans have normally featured the No. 6 doubles pair in Hanfmann and Johnson along with Gomez and Quiroz, the team has recently played other combinations to give freshmen Hanfmann and Quiroz more experience.
“Steve’s our captain, and we’ll have to learn from him,” Quiroz said. “He’s such a good player. I’m trying to learn every match.”
Quiroz’s new partner shares similar confidence about the pairing.
“[Roberto] is a very accomplished doubles player,” Johnson said. “We’ve really gotten together and played well.”
The Trojans improved to 4-2 all-time against the Gators and added one more win to their 38-match streak that dates back to last February.
USC is now 4-0 in March after a 7-0 sweep against No. 50 Virginia Tech on March 9 and two road victories against No. 13 Texas and No. 20 Texas A&M last week.
The Trojans will host No. 38 Boise State (13-5) next Monday at Marks Tennis Stadium in USC’s final match before conference play.
Great job Trojan tennis team.  These guys really ROCK!!! Come out & see them play. I have seen football players at the home games and the level of play is high.
This is one of the all time greatest Tennis Teams.   They are strong top to bottom.
Do yourself a favor and take a peek at Marx Stadium next Monday. U will B glad U did.
Coach Smith has assembled an amazing team.
Fight On & On!!!!

The No. 3 USC men’s volleyball team extended its winning streak after sweeping both No. 2 UCLA and No. 14 UC Santa Barbara with scores of 25-17, 25-14, 25-22 and 25-18, 25-22, 25-23 respectively over spring break. The young Trojan team has hit its stride. Since the unceremonious loss in consecutive sets at home against the Bruins more than a month ago, the Trojans have been on a 10-match tear.
“We keep getting better with more time on the court together,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “Also, Tony Ciarelli has been nothing short of remarkable since the Stanford match. He willed us to win against UCLA and Pepperdine.”
The Trojans (15-4, 12-4) exacted revenge on the Bruins (19-4, 13-3) in response to a disappointing loss at home more than a month ago.
USC rallied behind senior outside hitter and co-captain Ciarelli’s match-high 14 kills and six aces. The national player of the year candidate has been remarkable, with 15 aces in the last two weeks .
“I really got in a rhythm, starting with the Pepperdine match. I figured out my toss and it makes it easier to serve tough,” Ciarelli said. “The aces come and go, but the more important thing is that I haven’t missed many serves.”
The Trojans also got boosts from redshirt junior outside hitter Steven Mochalski, who finished with 12 kills at a .421 rate, and from junior opposite Maddison McKibbin, who finished with 11 kills.
“We’re more mature than we were in February. We have a lot more experience and that’s especially helped for the young guys,” Ciarelli said. Even though we won in three it felt like a five-game match because it was so emotional and the rivalry was so big. We really wanted it.”
The Bruins tried a variety of lineups in an effort to kick-start their offense. The Bruins had no player with more than Jeremy Casebeer’s seven kills as the Trojans held the Bruins to .282 hitting.
“Coach [Jeff] Nygaard’s blocking gameplan was great. Their big hitters Weston Dunlap and Thomas Amberg had decent percentages but not a lot of kills,” Ferguson said. “We served much better this time around and we forced them to be predictable. We didn’t get a ton of stuffs but we altered a lot of shots and got them uncomfortable.”
The Trojans continued their tour de force two days later against struggling UC Santa Barbara (5-17, 3-14) behind an overwhelming performance attacking, serving, blocking and digging. The Trojans out-hit (.379 to .117), out-blocked (9-3), out-dug (20-14) and out-served (7-3 aces) the Gauchos en route to a 3-0 victory.
“I was really proud of the fact that we came out after an emotional win against UCLA and we still maintained our poise and focus,” Ferguson said. “That’s a perfect trap match — it’s a tough place to play and they make a lot of substitutions, so it’s tough to gameplan against them. We had to focus on us and how we played. We were a little more sloppy but we were still good enough to get it done ugly.”
Ciarelli again led the way with a team-high 10 kills earned at a .412 rate. Freshman setter Micah Christensen continued his steady improvement as the Trojans’ main distributor, connecting on 30 assists that resulted in the team’s phenomenal hitting efficiency.
“[Christensen’s] been impressive. He’s very detail oriented. He picks up nuances and tendencies from the other team really well and he follows the gameplan impeccably,” Ferguson said. “There’s always a play in a match where he sees something that we looked at on video that’s different — like a quarterback audible — and he’ll pick it up. He’s a great competitor and play’s with a lot of poise.”
The win streak brought sixth-year coach Bill Ferguson his 100th career victory at USC. Ferguson now sports a 100-62 career record at USC. Though his career has been impressive, the man at the helm of the Trojans’ men’s volleyball program remains fixed on the national title.
“It’s a credit to the coaches I work with and players we’ve been fortunate enough to coach. It’s very humbling to do that in our league with all these great coaches and I’m fortunate I get to do it at a place like at ‘SC,” Ferguson said. “But I’m only worried about a two-game winning streak in May.”
USC’s next match is Friday against George Mason University in the Physical Education North Gym, where the Trojans played before moving to the Galen Center.

The USC women’s golf team, still seeking its first tournament victory, recorded another strong opening in the Battle at Rancho Bernardo Monday, finishing play tied for second at 7-over-par 295.
The tournament, held at the Rancho Bernardo Inn Championship Golf Course in San Diego, is hosted by San Diego State and features 16 teams, including Washington, Arizona and California. The tournament spans two days, with play concluding Tuesday.

Damp, gloomy conditions created considerable struggles, but USC received a strong effort from sophomore Sophia Popov, who notched three birdies and two bogeys to finish tied for third at 1-under-par 71. Freshman Doris Chen continued her strong spring season with a finish of 1-over-par 73, including three birdies, to place ninth. Senior Inah Park came in tied for 22nd at   3-over-par 75, while sophomore Rachel Morris is currently tied for 27th at 4-over-par 76. Senior Lisa McCloskey, who started off strong with two birdies through the first three holes, struggled to a score of 7-over-par 79, tied for 58th.
Expectations are running especially high for the Trojans after their dominant 2011 season, in which they won four tournaments. Additionally, the Women of Troy notched their sixth consecutive top-5 NCAA finish, and their successful season included triumphs at the 2011 Pac-10 championships and 2011 NCAA West Regional. Such success brought numerous accolades to the team, as Popov was named National and Pac-10 Freshman of the Year while coach Andrea Gaston captured National Coach of the Year honors for the second time in her 16 years at the helm.
The Women of Troy, ranked No. 3 nationally by Golf World, have overcome a less-than-stellar fall campaign to remain competitive in the spring but have not been able to achieve a tournament victory. After a resounding second-place finish in the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge to start the spring half, the Women of Troy had their best opportunity to win the Allstate Sugar Bowl last month but surrendered the lead on the final day, finishing third overall.
All-American McCloskey, who leads the team in stroke average (72.27), finished third in the competition and has now recorded four top-10 finishes this year. Popov, whose fall season was cut short with a wrist injury, has rebounded nicely in the spring, taking second at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge and tying for 16th at the Allstate Sugar Bowl. The Women of Troy have also received consistently strong performances from Chen, who has compiled two top-10 finishes so far in the spring after participating in only one fall tournament. Park has notched three top-20 finishes in five starts, while Morris has started every tournament, including a 16th-place finish at the Stanford Intercollegiate in October.
Though victories have been hard to come by, the team insists that the goals remain the same. “We were hoping for a win since our team is in good shape,” Popov said. “We have to work hard now in order to get our first spring win in San Diego.”

On March 10, the women’s sand volleyball team played its inaugural match. Sand volleyball, USC’s newest sport, is USC’s 12th women’s athletic team. The inaugural match was timely because of the recent celebration of the 40th anniversary of Title IX.
Commonly referenced in regards to equality in women’s athletics, many overlook Title IX’s initial purpose. On the heels of the Civil Rights Movement, Title IX sought to energize the women’s movement. Title IX was eventually passed in 1972, aiming to cease discrimination in education.
The law states, “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”
In accordance with Title IX, universities (among other institutions) are required to provide equal treatment for all athletic programs.
Thus, the passage of Title IX has revolutionized high school and college athletics, granting everyone, regardless of sex, the opportunity to play athletics at the next level. Not surprisingly, USC has consistently supported equality in athletics. This unwavering support has benefited the Trojan Family greatly.
Most associate USC’s great success in athletics with male-dominated sports, such as football, water polo and tennis. But during the reign of the Women of Troy, USC has produced numerous notable female athletes such as Lisa Leslie (basketball), Debbie Green (volleyball) and Rebecca Soni (swimming),
Athletic excellence is not uncommon within the realm of USC women’s athletics. In the early days of Title IX, a sister duo at USC helped pave the way for future Women of Troy and non-USC female collegiate athletes alike. Pam and Paula McGee, both of whom recently had their jerseys retired, led the Women of Troy to two consecutive national championships in 1983 and 1984 and were awarded several accolades during their time at USC.
In addition, Pam represented the U.S. in the 1984 Olympics. The McGee sisters inspired many with every lay-up and free throw, emphasizing great Trojan traditions and putting women’s athletics on the map.
Since the McGee dynasty, Women of Troy athletic teams have continued to excel. Not only are female athletes succeeding in the realm of NCAA competition, but Women of Troy athletes have also been no stranger to the Olympic spotlight.
Today, the face of Trojan athletics is continuing to evolve by incorporating a variety of women’s teams.
Just one year ago, USC announced the addition of a women’s lacrosse team, which will make its debut in 2013. This newest addition, along with sand volleyball, emphasizes the diversity of sports within USC’s athletic department. This diversity of sports will propel USC athletics into all-around athletic dominance, rather than being notable simply because of success in football.
Unfortunately, some may be quick to devalue the importance of women’s collegiate athletics by citing superiority in male dominated sports.
Yes, men’s athletics at USC have racked up 93 NCAA men’s championships.  In the coming decades, however, don’t be surprised if the Women of Troy start adding hardware to the trophy cabinets at Heritage Hall as well.
Forty years after the passing of Title IX, USC is carrying on the intentions of Title IX’s initiators, granting equal treatment of all collegiate athletes.
It has empowered female athletes at the high school and college levels. Without a doubt, USC owes its athletic dominance to Title IX.

The Author of the article failed to point out 3 points about Title IX:
1.) Title IX has devastated male collegiate athletics, especially in the Olympic sports.
2.) Since the Football team is the powerhouse on campus, Title IX has required University’s to cut funding to male sports, beside Football and Basketball, and giving those scarce dollars (and scholarships) to what is basically female club teams.
3.) Title IX could also be considered unwarranted governmental intrusion, especially at a Private University.
To sum-up we are subsidizing Women’s Lacrosse, at the expense of Men’s Lacrosse. We are subsidizing Women’s “Sand” Volleyball, at the expense of our own Men’s Indoor team. How is that considered acceptable policy?

A single centimeter made all the difference for USC Track and Field two weekends ago in Nampa, Idaho.
Competing among the best in the nation, junior Alitta Boyd was USC’s sole representative at the NCAA Division-I Indoor Championships on March 9 and 10.

Before entering the meet, she had previously placed in long jump at Division I competitions such as the New Balance Collegiate Invitational and Texas A&M Invitational. Boyd jumped 6.18 meters, missing the cutoff for the finals by a centimeter.
She was moved out of position by the University of Central Florida’s Sonnisha Williams, who clinched the spot at finals with a 6.19 meter jump during flight two. The men’s team did not compete indoors, and the women’s team was unable to qualify in other events. Robbed of a last stab at victory, the USC Trojans did not walk away with any championship wins at the NCAA finals.
The indoor season might be over and done, but USC is still preparing for outdoors. Last weekend USC competed at the Northridge Invitational, but field conditions did not look favorable and USC pulled out for the majority of the meet.
“The conditions were terrible, and the weather didn’t hold up,” USC coach Ron Allice said. “Outside of the hammer competition on Friday the majority of the team did not compete.”
Though most of the Trojans track and field squad did not participate in last weekend’s meet, USC still managed to secure a win. Senior captain Marissa Minderler finished first in women’s javelin throw with a final distance of 40.98 meters. Minderler previously finished third at the Ben Brown Invitational at Long Beach State.
Bad weather conditions might have prevented the Trojans from competing at full strength during last weekend’s meet, but they continue to prepare for the upcoming Trojan Invitational, taking place at USC’s Loker Stadium. The Trojans will not only be defending their home turf but will also be proving themselves against stiff competition from top-25 teams for the first time in the outdoor season.
“This is the best track meet outside of the major conference meets,” Allice said of the Trojan Invitational. “Outside of those, there is no meet in the country that is bringing in the quality of teams that the Trojan Invitational does.” Opponents include Oregon, who won the NCAA Women’s Indoor Championship, as well as Texas A&M, who will be defending the men’s national title for the third year in a row.

Seniors Katinka Hosszu and Victoria Ishimatsu and junior Haley Anderson helped spearhead USC’s efforts in the 2012 NCAA women’s swimming and diving championships, winning a combined four titles between Thursday and Saturday to lead the Trojans to a second-straight third-place finish at Auburn’s James E. Martin Aquatics Center in Auburn, Ala.

This marks USC’s third-ever third-place finish at the NCAAs, as well as its 10th top-five finish and 24th top-10 finish. California took home the win, followed by Georgia, USC, Stanford and Arizona.
“While not a flawless meet at NCAAs, it was probably as close to perfect as you might get in any major competition,” six-year USC coach Dave Salo said. “We weren’t batting 1.000, but I would grade it at least a .750 in baseball terms — and that is pretty good.”
Salo said he was proud of the effort that his team put forth at the championships.
“They swam very well, had great spirit and had the experience that makes competing in college all worthwhile,” Salo said. “Great personal lessons are learned under stressful competitive situations that characterize                            Division-I sports.”
Ishimatsu and Anderson started the event off on Thursday with wins in the 1-meter springboard and 500-yard freestyle, respectively. Ishimatsu’s win marked her first NCAA title, and USC’s first NCAA diving title since 2006, while Anderson’s win beat her school record by two seconds (4:34.48), and was USC’s first NCAA title in the event since Lindsay Benko in 1999. It also marked Anderson’s first NCAA title.
Thursday was the first time since 1997 USC won two events on the same day of the NCAA championship. That year, Kristine Quance won the 200-yard breastroke, while Benko won the 200-yard backstroke.
Hosszu would represent the Women of Troy in the victory circle for the next two days, winning the 400-yard individual medley. Her time of 3:56.54 shattered the previous NCAA record set by Julia Smit in 2010 (3:58.23).
Hosszu ended the tournament with five NCAA titles, third-most in USC history behind Kristine Quance (eight) and Rebecca Soni (six). She also earned the maximum seven All-American honors, becoming the first person to do that since Quance in 1997, bringing her total up to 20. The last person with 20 or more All-American honors in a career was Benko, who earned 21 from 1996-1999. Her 57 individual points tied Cal’s Caitlin Leverenz for the most in the tournament.
The four overall titles also marks USC’s most since winning four in 1997, and the three individual winners matches their 1980 record for most individual champions in a season.
Salo has high expectations for next season as well. “Nothing less than a top five performance next year is expected,” Salo said. “And we will guide our team through that process next season.”

The third installment of BioWare’s epic sci-fi franchise Mass Effect 3 is the culmination of one of the biggest video game franchises of this generation.

Mass Effect 2 took the series to another level and ended on an exceptional cliffhanger, but Mass Effect 3 proves to be a worthy conclusion for the series. The game brings just enough role-playing game (RPG) elements to flesh the personal interface out, improves the gameplay mechanics and incorporates objective-driven multiplayer that feels like an intricate part of the main storyline rather than something tacked on, which some fans had feared.
With Mass Effect 3, BioWare truly brings to fruition the intersecting storylines and character arcs that have developed since 2007’s Mass Effect. Though the game’s conclusion has proven to be extremely controversial with fans, any disappointment still can’t take away from the characters and the emotional weight of the tough decisions you have to make to take back Earth.
Despite the warnings of protagonist Commander Shepard, the mythical mechanical entities known as the Reapers have returned to the galaxy after 50,000 years with an all-out assault on organic life. Forced to leave Earth behind, Shepard must travel across the galaxy to recruit war assets and fighters from other alien races to stop the Reapers and save the planet.
Whether one’s played the previous two games contributes a lot to the emotional investment of the player to the game’s events and the amoral diplomacy the player must achieve to get the various galactic races on his or her side. Experiencing the triology from the very beginning gives more weight to the game’s story arcs and context, such as the Krogans and their genetic plight, or the war between the Quarians and the sentient Geth.
And certain character arcs are all the more fascinating if one has been able to see them progress from the first game to the third.  Seeing someone like Liara T’Soni, the Asari biotic, turn from a naive graduate student into a callous and calculating information broker shows the strength of BioWare’s storytelling and the commitment shown to really fleshing out these characters, especially in the case that the decisions the player has made in the last two games directly affect a particular character.
For a gamer playing for the first time, it’s nice to note that BioWare offers different ways to play.  Action Mode offers automatic replies for interactive conversations and normal combat difficulty, Story Mode has manual replies and minimal combat difficulty and RPG Mode strikes a balance with manual replies and normal combat difficulty.  Considering how crucial the storytelling and the player’s moral and tactical decisions are to the game, however, RPG Mode is definitely the way to go.
The gameplay works about as well as it did in Mass Effect 2.  The action is fast and exciting, the powers are a blast to use and there are just enough strategic elements to prevent the combat from being too monotonous: The surprising thing is how much more difficult the game is compared to the last two.  The Xbox 360 version can also use Kinect for voice commands — the capability of which isn’t groundbreaking but works effectively, and there’s a certain gratification in shouting “Garrus, concussive shot!”
The galaxy exploration has been trimmed down even further from the last game.  The player no longer tediously gathers elements but rather primarily collects “war assets,” which are used against the Reapers. Unfortunately, side missions are reduced to gathering quests, which is disappointing considering Mass Effect 2’s great variety in exploration possibilities.
The game offers a multiplayer co-op mode called “Galaxy at War” where you play with three other people against continual waves of enemies — think a more objective-based version of the Horde mode from the Gears of War series. The more you play, the more you raise the effectiveness of your war assets in the single-player campaign, increasing the odds of attaining a “perfect” ending to the campaign. It’s a welcome synergy between the two modes and adds a compelling reason to try multiplayer.
The graphics look fantastic, and the game’s aesthetics are helped greatly by the incredible design work of the BioWare art team. There’s hardly any texture pop-in, and though the lip-syncing can get a bit sloppy, the character animations work overall. The voice-acting helps with a cast featuring celebrities such as Carrie Anne-Moss, Keith David, Seth Green, Freddy Prinze Jr. and Martin Sheen.
Mass Effect 3 is an amazing experience that flaunts top-notch graphics and entertaining gameplay despite the simplification of certain elements. The game’s true strength, however, lies in its story. It’s not only one of the best stories in modern video games, but it stands on its own as one of the most enthralling science fiction stories of all time — akin to Star Trek but with the intensity of 24 and the production values of an HBO series. BioWare has certainly fulfilled its promise in creating a truly engrossing sci-fi universe.
Video games are lame.  They are about as much of an art form as the Transformers film franchise.
Emotional attachment? Please. The majority of the dialogue in this game feels as though it was tacked on as a lip service to the title. While the plot itself is not inherently bad, the delivery is poor; character interactions and development are downright shoddy in most scenes, and lack coherency with the rest of the series, depth, and content.
So you must be able to do better, I’ll be waiting to spend $60 on your production when you get it finished. (NOT) you loser!!!!!!!!
Dude, don’t troll this article. The game was amazing and there was definite emotional attachment for those of us who have played the game since ME1. The only part that /some/ people have a problem with is the ending, and imo I think it was a test to see whether Shepard could withstand indoctrination.

Television has had many ups and downs in recent weeks with returns, delays and cancellations, giving way to the widespread instability in modern television programming.
This holds particularly true as Tuesday falls squarely between the long-delayed midseason return of NBC’s gleefully eccentric gang comedy Community and the even longer delayed season five premiere of AMC’s brooding period drama Mad Men.
Five days removed from the first original episode of Community since December and only five days to go until the first original episode of Mad Men in 15 months, by all accounts, this should have been a great month for TV-lovers everywhere.
But the surprise cancellation of Luck, starring Dustin Hoffman and created by legendary television director David Milch, put a real damper on the festivities just one day before Community could resume. HBO announced it was pulling the plug on the cerebral horse racing drama following the third production-related death of a horse on set.
When a vociferous, social media-savvy fan base plays a not-so-insignificant role in wresting a show from the gaping maw of cancellation (as was the case with Community), when embarrassingly public contract negotiations can put a show on hiatus for more than a year and a half (not Mad Men’s finest moment) and something as unexpected as animal casualties can kill a show outright, strung-along fans have to wonder: Is “stability” anything more than a nine-letter word in the world of television today?
All of these shows’ potentially dooming individual problems — ratings struggles, money talks, production complications — are emblematic of a larger trend in which networks seem to be treating shows as disposable commodities rather than projects that can be mended, developed or improved upon with time and attention.
The current industry model prefers no-assembly-required successes to debuts that might require a bit in the way of nurturing. It’s a scary thought, but some of television’s best-loved and longest-running programs — Cheers, M*A*S*H, Murphy Brown, Friends — might not have stood a chance had they premiered in today’s television climate.
Cobbling together a lineup has always been a study in fickle uncertainty, and it’s roundly understood that no programming decision is ever set in stone. Midseason reshufflings of schedules and time slots are common practice. And from a business standpoint, certain decisions, such as cancelling a show midseason and burning off episodes that have already been shot, make sense for the network despite irking audiences.
Though that might be true, recent years have seen unbelievable amounts of programming-related upheaval. Critics and fans alike have lamented the wave of snap cancellations of freshman shows that have yet to hit their stride. For every debut that gets promptly and justifiably pulled from the programming schedule (Charlie’s Angels, The Playboy Club), there’s a show with genuine promise whose execution somehow misses the mark (Pan Am, Terra Nova).
For those not-fully-lost causes, there’s little audiences can do besides root for the show as it limps across the finish line and hope that its season one finale doesn’t become its series finale as well. More and more, networks are growing impatient with debuts that don’t post solid ratings straight out the gate, but that kind of shortsightedness overlooks the importance of letting a fledgling show find its voice.
Community’s obsessively devoted die-hard fans refused to take the show’s indefinite hiatus lying down, instead taking to Facebook, Twitter and Meme Generator to protest and campaign for a timely resumption.
Mobilized audiences are becoming the rule rather than the exception — Community represents the highest profile case of audience activism in recent memory, but it by no means was the first, and it won’t be the last of such cases. Though undying support for the idea of an Arrested Development movie recently buoyed the concept into reality, attributing causality merely to vocal fans would obviously be a gross simplification.
The consequences were undoubtedly dire in regard to Luck’s unfortunate mishaps — three equine deaths in the course of one season of shooting is absolutely inexcusable and clearly indicates a certain amount of negligence on the crew’s part. That aside, the issue itself is  pretty random.
Who would have expected that an HBO original series starring one of the greatest living actors would be put out to pasture because of a high mortality rate for set animals? In retrospect, greater care could and should have been taken with the horses, but it’s hard to treat Luck as a cautionary tale when the circumstances that led to its cancellation are unique to the show.
In short, television today is in a state of chronic uncertainty. Being picked up for another season is never guaranteed, and many a showrunner would be remiss to take even the next episode of his or her show for granted.
In a lot of cases, there’s little that can be done about the pervasive instability that defines contemporary TV programming. Audience members should remember, however, that they vote with their viewership, and no amount of social media campaigning can replace actually tuning in to the shows.
With any luck, these shows might even go on to achieve the lofty, industry-standard goal of six seasons and a movie or, as Community staffer Megan Ganz recently speculated optimistically in an interview with The Daily Beast, “12 seasons and a theme park.”

It should have been hilarious. With excessive stylization, English subtitles and Hollywood comedian Will Ferrell, Casa de mi Padre had the potential to be the next Talladega Nights or Blades of Glory. Unfortunately, the film was only mildly amusing.
Director Matt Piedmont’s latest picture is a caricature of a Spanish soap opera. The story takes place in rural Mexico where ranchero Armando Alvarez (Ferrell) struggles to improve his cowardly image as he stands up to his drug-dealing brother, Raul (Diego Luna).

As Alvarez proclaims his love of the land and the importance of family honor, he falls for the beautiful Sonia (Genesis Rodriguez), who happens to be his brother’s fiancee and the coveted love object of the powerful drug lord, Onza (Gael Garcia Bernal). Through a series of incidents that don’t further the plot, Alvarez makes his way to Onza’s mansion to win back his woman and his name in a bloody Mexican standoff.
Through movies like Step Brothers, Zoolander and Anchorman, Ferrell has proved that “stupidly funny” works — a movie does not have to possess an intricate plot or highbrow jokes to captivate audiences. But Casa de mi Padre misses even the idiotically comical and only incites a faint smile among viewers rather than genuine laughter.
It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact moment where the film fails to be truly hilarious, particularly since it sets itself up so nicely.
For starters, the entire picture is in Spanish, which forces the audience to rely on subtitles to convey the intentionally cheesy dialogue. This is somewhat intriguing, especially because Ferrell stands out among the largely Hispanic cast.
Ferrell uses the language well as he emphasizes certain universally understood phrases to inspire laughter. He holds his own against the other Spanish-speaking actors and keeps an intense expression plastered on his face to mock a soap opera’s usual intensity. Though his delivery is entertaining, the lines are uninteresting, which leaves the movie unquotable even for Spanish speakers.
Still, the exaggerated genres should have made the film hilarious. By mixing action with steamy romance, Casa de mi Padre has the potential to poke fun at usual film conventions and break the rules even as it relies on them. Unfortunately, the movie seems unsure of itself and lacks the technique necessary for a successful parody.
In some of the more violent scenes, the actors take time with bloody deaths, writhing and squirming in an unrealistic way that should be funny, but only seems trite. In sequences reminiscent of a gangster film, drug-dealers casually smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol as they aim guns at their opponents, using the icons of the “mobster figure” in a way that seems out of place. These gestures at satire might be a little amusing, but they mostly appear awkward.
Casa de mi Padre also confuses itself with unnecessary subplots. In an attempt to create a drug war between Raul and the Onza, racist American secret agent (Nick Offerman) teams up with a corrupt Mexican officer (Manuel Urrego). Though this element of the story provides one solid joke — the American agent attempts to speak Spanish with a realistic and comical accent — it proves tiresome, especially when the film fails to truly resolve it by the end.
Instead of figuring out a way to incorporate the characters into the final battle scene, the movie deals with its pointless subplot in the last five minutes of the film, relying on an annoying series of deus ex machinas that leave the audience confused and dissatisfied.
One thing the film does do well, however, is make fun of itself. Aware of its corny dialogue and stereotypical premise, Casa de mi Padre intentionally calls attention to itself as a low-budget, unintelligent picture. There are animatronic animals, product placements and second-rate special effects that make the unabashed cheesiness hilarious.
At one point in the film, Ferrell and Rodriguez, pretending to ride horses, rock back and forth as a forged backdrop of a landscape rolls past, conveying movement for the stationary actors. Later, Ferrell and his two sidekicks (played by Efren Ramirez and Adrian Martinez) drive on a highway on a search for Raul. The film immediately cuts to a miniature model of a Mexican town where toy cars simulate the travel of the gang. At these points, Casa de mi Padre succeeds with ingenious humor.
Nevertheless, the film falls short of being comically memorable and doesn’t stand out among Ferrell’s other work.

USC claims to prioritize the liberal arts. According to the USC website’s undergraduate admission page, the undergraduate curriculum “emphasizes critical thinking, verbal and written communication, and humankind’s history and diversity.”
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
True to this statement, the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences is the biggest school at USC, encompassing a vast number of majors and minors.
This diversity of programs would seem to lead to a vibrant, interdisciplinary community within Dornsife. Still, the school has room for improvement.
The great number of programs in Dornsife leads to a lack of unity within the school. As such, Dornsife’s chief concern should be to foster more community feeling.
While students in the professional schools receive specialized attention and perks, Dornsife students often feel lost.
One of the most obvious barriers to a sense of community is physical. Dornsife has no central building. Many classes are located in the VKC-Taper area, but other classes take students to the most distant parts of campus.
There’s no place that all Dornsife students can call their own.
Dornsife advising could also use bolstering. Though more involved advising in some of the other USC schools is because of their more structured curricula, Dornsife should still give more support to its students.
Another problematic element of Dornsife is the College Basic Requirement, which requires all Dornsife majors to complete at least 104 units within Dornsife unless a student is double-majoring in a professional school.
At 16 units a semester, a four-year student will have completed 128 units.
After the College Basic Requirement, there is little room for error.
Thus, this requirement keeps students from pursuing a truly interdisciplinary course of study.
Why does this arbitrary restriction exist?
If administrators are trying to restrict students to Dornsife to build a community, they should also help create an actual community to validate their own policy.
Dornsife also does not have its own career center or job fair, like many of the other USC schools.
Admittedly, it would be difficult to create one center for so many different areas of study, but leaving Dornsife students to depend on the general career center puts them at a disadvantage.
Dornsife’s problems are solvable.
More events should be planned for only Dornsife students, and the administration should find a way to interact more with students.
With Dornsife currently in search for a dean, candidates for the position should be sure to emphasize the sense of community that Dornsife students have been waiting for.
If USC wants to continue to highlight its liberal arts program, then it should do more to make its liberal arts students feel like they’re a part of a larger community.

Dornsife, I still choke on it.
Who gave anyone the right to sell the Colleges name?
The way to improve Dornsife’s reputation is to improve the doctoral programs. Unfortunately, no one really cares about undergrads. Really, what kind of career do you expect to get as a history or sociology major?

Advanced Placement classes have been a part of both public and private high school education since 1955. But recent federal budget cuts that decrease funding for AP programs beg the question: Who are the classes really benefiting?
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
Congress has officially cut federal financing for high schools and programs offering AP courses from $43 million to slightly under $27 million, a decrease of nearly 50 percent. This cut hits low-income students the hardest. Though those students have been eligible for AP exam fee waivers, state education officials are now notifying high schools that low-income students will have to pay $15 for each of the first three exams they take and $53 for any additional exam.
Even if the AP courses remain free, participation in the AP program, which is housed by the College Board, has very little value without taking the exam. Those two letters on a high school transcript won’t impress college admissions officers or scholarship committees nearly as much without the scores to back them up.
So although upper- and middle- class students who can still afford to pay for their exams continue to reap the benefits of the AP program, low-income students are left unable to validate a class’s worth of hard work.
As Louis Toro, the Advanced Placement coordinator at Classical High School in Providence, R.I., told The New York Times, the best many students can do is to choose among exams, which many of Toro’s students were forced to do.
More importantly, the classes alone won’t count for college credit. The irony of this situation is that low-income students are the demographic that stand to benefit most from AP exams, because the college credit they earn by passing can save them thousands of dollars in college tuition in the years to come.
They also have the greatest need for college scholarships, some of which might use AP scores as selection criteria.
The AP program is supposed to offer American high school students an opportunity for free and convenient access to college-level courses. Just like private schooling, professional tutoring and personal college counselors, however, the program has proven to be a luxury available only to some.
And though the recent budget cuts have made the situation much worse, low-income students have experienced marginalization at the AP program’s hands for years.
Limited resources, overcrowding and lack of qualified teachers often restrict the number of AP courses a low-income high school can offer and the number of students who are eligible to take them. As reported by College Board in 2010, only 33.7 percent of public high schools offered even basic AP courses in the four core subject areas: language arts, math, science and social studies.
Low-income students also cannot usually afford AP preparation books, CDs and other preparatory media. Other students might spend nearly $100 buying five or six of these and using them to cram for the exam, or to supplement their regular course work year round.
Right now, the College Board, SAT testing, the CSS profile and a host of other costly college planning resources, have complete control over determining which high school students are rewarded for the advanced work they undertake.
High schools and colleges alike have to find a better, less expensive way to affirm that work — one that doesn’t need a federal subsidy. Is a national standardized exam the only way that this can be achieved? What about writing samples, school interviews, college-sponsored placement tests and grades?
The AP program can be an enriching educational experience, but its benefits only go as far as funding allows. Educators need to find a way around the program’s expenses, or risk alienating low-income students from its distinct advantages altogether.

Collegeboard is just another greedy corporation. Is there really any logic in charging that much for a test in the first place?
Does anyone seriously think that there are families who can’t fork out $15 for an AP exam?
Well, someone’s a bit snobbish. Wouldn’t you say?
@Francesca, please don’t do statistics a disservice: it’s approximately 38% in the cut, not 50%.

Though ComicCon may be better known, WonderCon, which wrapped Sunday in Anaheim, Calif., coaxed film studios into releasing trailers for upcoming films. For sci-fi and fantasy films, 2012 looks better than 2011. Now that we leave January and February behind – the dregs of the film year – we can look to spring and summer to remind us why films get us pumped.
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter
Russian director Timur Bekmambetov proves ridiculously awesome and awesomely ridiculous are one in the same. Though history remembers Honest Abe as a manic depressant president with a knack for speeches and a stylish hat, this film focuses on the part of Lincoln’s life when he slayed the undead and impressed ladies with his antebellum ninjitsu.
The second trailer, just revealed, shows far more action than the shadowy teaser. Judging from the explosions and backflips, Bekmambetov is giving pre-Civil War America his own frenetic twist. No one should expect a glorious tribute to Americana, but if you liked Wanted, check it out June 22.
Prometheus
When you create a disaster like Robin Hood, the best thing to do is shake it off and keep walking like nothing happened. Now that Ridley Scott has released a new trailer for Prometheus, Ridley haters should pipe down for a second. A not-direct prequel to Alien, the film follows a ship of scientists who stumble on something not meant to be stumbled on. Fill in the juicy details, or check out the epic trailer. The ship lands June 8.
The Amazing Spider-Man
Technically, the trailer premiered before WonderCon, but the creative talent had a well-received panel that answered questions on the film. It still seems ridiculously early for a reboot, but this film distances itself from the previous excursions with a more youthful Spidey and more canonical storyline. As long as Peter Parker doesn’t go back into emo frat boy mode, we should be in for a fun summer flick, starting July 3rd.
Looper
Sci-fi got smacked around last year with the disappointing In Time. Looper, thank goodness, received oodles of praise when its noirish trailer premiered at WonderCon. Sadly, it won’t be officially out for a few more weeks and YouTube quickly swipes any leaked versions. The concept, however, is worth the interest alone.
In a nearish future, time travel is possible but illegal. The mob’s favorite way to get rid of someone is to send them back in time, into the arms of an assassin. When an assassin working for a future mob realizes he’s one of the targets, he springs into action. Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis play the same character in this jaunt through time. Remember this one for September 2012.
Snow White and the Huntsman
Haters will hate, but banishing Kristen Stewart to the realm of sparkly vampires seems a tad unfair. This upcoming Snow White flick, also starring Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth, puts Snow White in a suite of armor and makes her fight to keep her heart inside her body. Ogres, crow monsters and beautiful white stags also make an appearance in the newest trailer. Theron in particular looks gorgeous and sinister as the Evil Queen. The film appears to make true on its promise of an epic take on Snow White. We’ll find out June 1st.
