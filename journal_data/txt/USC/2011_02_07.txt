Eric Burse and Andy Greos, both currently directors for USG’s Program Board, are running for Undergraduate Student Government president and vice-president, advocating for improving the locks on dorms and expanding USCard to local restaurants.

Burse, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism and political science, is currently the director of the Black Student Assembly. Greos, a sophomore majoring in business administration, is the director of production for Program Board.
“Throughout the year, we saw things that were done [well], but we also saw things that could have been done better,” Burse said. “We never thought about running, but when the time came closer, we thought that we actually had some valid ideas that could come to fruition, so we decided to run.”
Burse and Greos believe their diverse involvement and academics make them a dynamic pair and better representatives of the student population.
“Out of all the candidates on the ticket this year, we’re the only ones that provide any kind of fair representation,” Burse said. “The other two tickets are completely Greek.”
Burse currently serves as a residential advisor in Parkside Apartments and also works with the Annenberg admissions office. Greos is on the executive board of the Trojan Knights and a member of the Sigma Nu Fraternity.
“We complement each other well,” Greos said. “We’re involved in very different things on campus, which allows [us] to reach a lot of different ideas and different constituencies.”
The two developed a platform looking to change the structure of USG. Two of the biggest changes the ticket advocates for are the creation of a student community service assembly in Program Board and allowing for traditional university events to be permanent fixtures in the USG budget.
“There’s no umbrella organization that represents [the service organizations],” Burse said. “We want to create a student community service assembly under Program Board. That’s a very big thing because there haven’t been any additions of assemblies for 10 years.”
The pair wants to encourage the university to allow for corporate sponsorships of events to increase funding and the quality of events.
Burse and Greos are also looking to set a series of long-lasting goals for their administration and administrations to come, if elected to office.
“We’re going to sit down with Chris [Cheng, current USG President] and Nehi [Ogbevoen, current USG vice-president] and also the USG president before and try to make a 10-year plan, of where we want to see USG in 10 years,” Burse said. “It’ll allow the next leader to continue working on the same projects that we were working on.”
In addition to improving safety and increasing the reach of USCard, Burse and Greos also have plans to improve sustainability. The two are working to enhance the new office of sustainability.
“We’re lobbying for a permanent sustainability office with professional and student workers so that we can really maintain that focus for the long-run,” Greos said.
Though USG presidential and vice-presidential candidates are often juniors, sophomores Burse and Greos do not think their age will be a problem.
“Andy and I have been significantly involved with USG and Program Board for our two years here,” Burse said. “We have great knowledge of things going on at USC … our grasp of what it means to be a Trojan is the same as [the other candidates’].”
The two have a volunteer team of 167 students who have done specific research in each area of campus, and they have brought all those ideas together to create their platform, according to Burse.
“We want to enhance the experience for every single student here,” Burse said. “Things that students will remember 20 years from now, that made their Trojan experience here at USC the best.”

The campaign for Los Angeles City Council’s 8th District seat is heating up, with candidates raising and receiving hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations and endorsements.
Forescee Hogan-Rowles is hoping to defeat incumbent Bernard Parks, who is seeking his third term on the city council.

The 8th District represents USC and its surrounding community as well as Baldwin Hills, Crenshaw, Chesterfield Square, Vermont Knolls and Leimert Park.
Hogan-Rowles, who made an unsuccessful bid for the 8th District seat in 2003, said that the lack of improvement in the district under Parks motivated her to run again.
“I ran in 2003 [for the 8th District seat] and didn’t win, but I decided that if the district wasn’t faring better in regards to business and employment than I would run again in eight years,” Hogan-Rowles said. “Things looked worse, and therefore I decided to run.”
Parks is running for a third term, and he said he hopes he can continue to build on the progress and development he has brought to the 8th District since 2003.
“In the first eight years we have brought $4.5 million in development to the community, led the city in job growth and renovated all of the parks and libraries in the district,” Parks said. “There is a lot to be done in the pipe lines, and I want to see these projects through.”
Parks said he renovated every park and recreational facility in the 8th district. For example, the Norman O. Houston Park now has a decomposed granite jogging path, playground with rubberized surface, new picnic tables and other improvements.
Both candidates have pledged to increase partnerships with USC.
In cooperation with USC, Parks hopes to develop more green space and redevelop the areas north and west of campus.
“I want to work in partnership with [USC] to expand the green space beyond Exposition Park,” Parks said. “I also want to work hand-in-hand with USC to renovate the houses in the North/West Park area into single family units, and assure that affordable housing is maintained in the area.”
Parks also wants to work with USC to increase the scope of the plans to renovate the University Village.
“I want to expand on the current plan to [the new University Village] Project to bring more jobs to the area,” Parks said.
Hogan-Rowles, however, argues that Parks has so far failed to utilize the benefits of USC to improve the 8th District.
“USC is a great asset to the 8th District, and the district has missed out thus far on the opportunity to use the expertise of the university to move forward,” Hogan-Rowels said. “We have a great opportunity to utilize the research function of the university to write grants to get more state and federal funding for the business community and overall desire to increase jobs.”
In conjunction with USC faculty, students and administrators, Hogan-Rowles wants to increase safety in the community surrounding USC and improve the landscape in Exposition Park.
“I plan to work with President [C. L. Max] Nikias, faculty and students to improve the district,” Hogan-Rowles said. Besides working more closely with USC, Hogan-Rowles wants to refurbish the business areas within the 8th District by ensuring the equal distribution of resources throughout the city.
“When I was growing up the retail corridors were operating and flourishing. The dilapidation that has occurred is unacceptable,” Hogan-Rowles said. “I want to make sure that the people [of the 8th District] receive the same resources that people in wealthier districts are receiving.”
Parks’ main focus, if re-elected, will be the city’s budget.
“It is most important to bring the budget in line to where it is solvent and sustainable, and to address pensions, medical costs, workers compensation and salaries,” Parks said.
Prior to his election to city council, Parks served as an officer for the Los Angeles Police Department.
Hogan-Rowles is currently the President and CEO of Community Financial Resource Center, which provides financial resources for businesses and residents in low-income areas.
The election for the 8th District seat will be held March 8.

When photos of the protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square hit the media, America was introduced to a muddled collection of images — an endless sea of people, spurts of fire and the foreign scribble of Arabic writing. Initially, it wasn’t clear what was going on, especially as Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak’s regime tried to tighten its grip on what the rest of the world saw, temporarily shutting down the Internet and discouraging journalists from doing their jobs.
Reflection · Hassan Ghozlan, a graduate student studying engineering, looks through photos and news clips from his war-torn country, Egypt. - Stephanie Guo | Daily Trojan 
But to engineering Ph.D. student Hassan Ghozlan, an Egyptian citizen who came to the United States for the first time in Fall 2009 to attend the Viterbi School of Engineering, the pictures were personal. They showed the square just across the Nile from his home, the place where a month ago he bought novels from a bookstore in the square.
And for freshman Richard Sidhom, whose family left Egypt and came to the United States when he was nine years old, the protesters in the streets of Alexandria, Sidhom’s birthplace, were cousins, distant relatives and friends that he had left behind.
The protests, which have been going on since Jan. 25, represent to Ghozlan and Sidhom a power struggle between Mubarak’s regime and the masses of average Egyptians who have been suffering for too long under Mubarak’s rule.
“It was not religious, it was not an Islamic uprising,” Ghozlan said. “It’s just people: engineers, university professors, doctors, average people. It was the youth, and that’s why it has hope to be successful.”
Both Ghozlan and Sidhom were raised under Mubarak’s rule and taught from a young age to refrain from speaking out in order to protect themselves — never to get into a fight or walk into a protest or hold a sign. Ghozlan compares Mubarak’s 30-year rule to that of Big Brother in George Orwell’s 1984.
It was always never do this, never do that, especially for Sidhom, who is a Coptic Catholic, a minority in Egypt.
But according to Ghozlan, the current protests transcend religious differences. To him they represent good, middle-class Egyptians standing up against a certain evil that has overstayed his welcome as their ruler.
“[Religion] is the card the [Mubarak] regime plays to the West — it’s either me, or the Muslim Brotherhood and the extremists,” Ghozlan said. “And people buy that.”
This isn’t the only issue Ghozlan feels Mubarak has swept under the rug. He believes that, over the last 10 or 15 years in particular, the regime has been a sham, featuring acts of deceit, corruption and oppression.
Videos have been leaked of Egyptian Parliament members being told how to vote and not being able to do otherwise. A Mubarak opponent trying to run for the presidency was sentenced to prison on counts of forgery. A ferry boat unfit for use sank in the waters of the Red Sea, drowning more than 1,300 Egyptians. These and thousands of other acts have seemed to go unpunished — until now.
“You don’t see what’s going under the carpet,” Ghozlan said. “People are boiling, people are mistreated, the regime is oppressive.”
This dynamic can be seen in the photos recently released. In one, an anti-Mubarak protester sits in the square holding a sign written in Arabic that translates to “Come on Hosni! I need to go home to grade the exams,” while in another, members of Mubarak’s National Democratic Party barge through the crowds on horse and camelback, a sight Ghozlan hadn’t seen in the square in the 25 years he lived in Cairo.
It is acts like these that lead Ghozlan to believe Mubarak cannot be trusted. Whether right now or in eight months, when the national elections are planned to take place. Ghozlan supports an immediate transfer of power, though he doesn’t think Mubarak needs to be exiled from Egypt for this to be successful.
Sidhom, on the other hand, is not quite as convinced. As a Coptic, he is somewhat wary of the Muslim Brotherhood taking over, and believes that if this occurs, it could cause problems for Egyptian Coptics. The worst-case scenario would be a Coptic diaspora from Egypt, according to Sidhom. But above all, he wants what is best for Egypt as a whole.
“What I’ve been noticing is on one hand, you have some people who are taking advantage of the chaos to act out these anti-Coptic feelings,” Sidhom said. “But on the other hand you have a lot of people who right now are saying, ‘We’re not Coptics and Muslims; we’re all Egyptians.’”
This nationalistic mentality can be seen both in the heart of Tahrir Square and thousands of miles away in Los Angeles, where Ghozlan and Sidhom can openly voice their opinions about Mubarak and what they see fit for the future of Egypt.
“It’s when one looks at the world and sees democracy and sees how things are run in democratic countries that he realizes how cruel it is to live in such a society,” Ghozlan said.

The well-presented interview by Phoebe Unterman, Trojan 7 Feb., showed a view of the Cairo protests that we haven’t found in the national news. The young  student, Hassan Ghozlan, a recent arrival from Egypt gave us a youth-oriented picture of the underlying problems that caused the protests.

Sunday, like the rest of America, I arrived at a Super Bowl party.
As I mingled with the other guests and wolfed down my second chili dog, the inevitable question arrived: Which team are you rooting for?
I did what I do whenever I’m asked that question regarding an NFL game — I waffled.
Yeah, the Steelers would probably win because of their experience, but the Packers had been playing great football. Troy Polamalu is a Trojan, so I’ll root for him, but then there’s Clay Matthews, a Trojan as well …
Boring, boring, boring. My answer screamed dispassion, the ugliest word in the dictionary of fandom. But that’s the problem.
I was born and raised in Los Angeles. I’ve heard rumors that there were once organizations known as the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Raiders, but I was too preoccupied with Power Rangers at that point in my life to take notice.
I am an NFL wanderer, and there are many others like me in this city.
Anybody born the mid-’80s falls into this demographic. We’re too young to remember when the biggest sport in America, was here and too habituated now to care about its absence.
We’re not even allowed the dignity of calling ourselves expatriates — it is as if we never had a country.
Now, the proposal to build a stadium in Downtown has steadily been gaining momentum. There is already a naming rights deal lined up with Farmers Insurance, worth a reported $700 million.
Alternatively, there is the Ed Roski proposal to build a stadium in the City of Industry, though this idea has lost some steam recently.
Courtesy of Creative Commons
There’s just that sense in the air that the nation’s second largest market will not be NFL-less for much longer.
I was thinking about these things as I objectively watched the Steelers and the Packers battle out a fantastic Super Bowl. I could appreciate the value of the game’s competitiveness and its entertainment.
I was impressed by big plays on both sides, like a non-confrontational soccer mom who wishes both teams could win. I had nothing invested in the game other than the five dollars I wagered in the squares pool.
If anything, I was rooting for a score, not a team.
Will this all change when Los Angeles has a team again?
No matter how hard I try, I cannot visualize being morphed into a Chargers fan or a fan of whichever franchise decides to move here.
Even if my city housed the team, the team would seem like a temporary guest. Passion cannot just materialize on command.
Those that create it artificially are bandwagon fans (the second ugliest concept in the dictionary of fandom, by the way). There is no love at first sight in sports.
Passion must be organic, and there is usually a seeding period that must happen at a certain age when the conditions are right, somewhere between eight to 14 years old.
All this made me realize that it might be too late for my generation. The NFL missed out on our passion.
No hard feelings or anything.
I will still watch the games because I love the sport, but I can never feel the passion of fans who grew up with the same team their whole lives.
Part of the problem is Los Angeles — the mentality of its fans. Angelenos expect greatness every year.
Although the Lakers have played in seven of the last 11 NBA Finals, their third-place standing in the Western Conference is causing panic.
After USC’s dominance during the Pete Carroll era, notice how much quieter the Coliseum was this year.
It’s not that an L.A. team has to be great to generate interest or revenue.  The Dodgers haven’t been to a World Series in 22 years, and the team is loved all over the city. Believe it or not, people still buy season tickets to UCLA football games.
A team just has to be synonymous with Los Angeles.
It has to exude an L.A. vibe. It’s true that both the Lakers and the Dodgers, the city’s biggest pro franchises, were imports: the Lakers from Minneapolis, the Dodgers from Brooklyn. Over time, those teams became woven into the city’s fabric.
Of course, with enough time and some success, that should happen with a Los Angeles NFL team.
But for my generation of NFL wanderers, a Los Angeles team will still feel artificial, as if we are preparing for a heart transplant.
We know the new heart will beat in rhythm and keep us alive, but we’ll always know the heart is not our own.

As a Trojan from SF, I welcome you all to become fans of a true california NFL franchise that has 5 Super Bowl Trophies in the case. Become a 49er!!
Will the Proposed Stadium change the Trojan Landscape?
As a NYer, I attended the 2010 Parents Weekend and the game against
Washington. Somehow walking North to a Downtown Stadium won’t be
the same as walking South to the Coliseum. Can the Trojans resist the
lure of Luxury Boxes?
I couldn’t disagree with you any more. You write as if  your thoughts and opinions are fact, when the actual facts show differently. People like you give LA a bad image. Do you really think we will support only a winning team, when some of the biggest losers in proffessional sports have and still do call LA home, obviously they are recieving enough support to remain in LA and remain financially viable. Also metro LA is a big market, no it’s a huge market and even if 1/3rd of the popoulation supported the team, that is still more than most metro areas that actually have a team. If nobody cared about the NFL in Los Angeles, then nobody would watch the NFL in LA, but guess what the NFL in LA still draws huge ratings and usually accounts for more than half of the most watched television events in LA. NFL games consistently out rank Laker games for crying out loud. You really think nobody cares? Am I expecting Los Angeles to turn into another Green Bay, Pittsburgh or Philadelphia in its unwavering support for an NFL team, of course not. But the point is Los Angeles is so huge, that we don’t need to turn into one of those cities to support a NFL team. It always seems to be the minority that speaks the loudest on such issues, but don’t get the wrong idea, the majority of Southern Californians would welcome the NFL back with open arms.

While much of the attention on campus last week was focused on football’s National Signing Day, the USC women’s tennis team quietly managed to recruit its own decorated class, regarded by multiple scouting services as No. 1 in the nation.
With the future addressed, the coaching staff can now focus all its efforts on the present.
Strong play · Junior Alison Ramos looks to get the Women of Troy back on the right foot as they begin a three-match homestand against San Diego State, South Florida and Texas at Marks Stadium. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
No. 19 USC (3-1) returns to the outdoor environs of Marks Stadium for a slate of games this week, beginning today with a match against San Diego State (3-1) at 1:30 p.m.
The team suffered its first loss of the season to Michigan last month in a tight affair in which a few unforced errors proved costly, forcing a 5-2 loss.
“We have six matches until UCLA, so we’re trying to build up a winning streak before that game,” said junior Alison Ramos. “Getting a win tomorrow is huge because we really need the confidence after the tough loss to Michigan.”
It has become a disappointment almost yearly during the tenure of Coach Gallien who has one final four in all the years he has been head coach at USC . This year and next has to produce big time or a change mandatory. Looking at the rankings for recruits how is ucla with two so close to the WOT with four who are all five stars?

Nothing fires up the Galen Center crowd more than a barrage of three-pointers by senior guard Donte Smith. Loud cheering quickly turns into a deafening roar after Smith uses his hands to create his trademark “three-point glasses.”
Call on me · Senior guard Donte Smith is one of three seniors on the men’s basketball team and has helped provide leadership and instant offense off the bench for a young Trojan squad. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
It was in a much quieter setting, however, that Smith regained the confidence and swagger he was missing during his first two years at USC.
With his son, Donte Smith Jr., now one year old, sitting silently just off the Galen Center court, Smith went through intense offseason workouts in preparation for his final collegiate season.
“He worked exceptionally hard on his conditioning and his shooting, and it paid off for him,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill.
Through 23 games this season, Smith has provided instant offense off the bench for the Trojans. He averages 10.3 points per game, which is third on the team, despite only playing 26.2 minutes per game. His .815 free-throw percentage leads the team, as does his .394 three-point shooting percentage among players with more than 10 three-point attempts in the season.
“He is one of the better shooters in the [Pac-10 Conference], and one of our main scoring options,” O’Neill said.
Smith has come a long way during his time at USC.
After transferring from Mt. San Antonio College, Smith struggled with his shooting while playing limited minutes as a sophomore. After making .580 of his three-point shots in high school, Smith shot .240 from beyond the arc, and an abysmal .257 from the field.
Last season, Smith was given the opportunity to start at point guard, but struggled as the team’s primary ball handler. He had just as many, or more, turnovers than assists in five of his first six games, as the Trojans began the season 2-4. When Mike Gerrity became eligible, Smith’s minutes decreased significantly.
Determined to make an impact on the team this season, Smith spent countless hours over the summer perfecting his three-point shot and improving his conditioning, which gave him a newfound confidence.
“I just stayed in the gym, that’s all it was,” Smith said. “I worked real hard.”
This season, O’Neill found a role that has suited Smith well. Rather than having Smith play point guard, where he looked uncomfortable last season, O’Neill used Smith as a shooting guard, which has allowed him to do what he does best — shoot.
“[Smith] playing off the ball has brought the best out of him,” said junior guard Jio Fontan. “He is a shoot-first type of player. He can stay in the corner and hit three-pointers instead of being a point guard.”
The Trojans have struggled all season playing against zone defenses. When opponents implement a zone, the Trojans have had trouble passing the ball to post players junior forward Nikola Vucevic and senior forward Alex Stepheson. Smith’s three-point shooting ability has kept zone defenses honest, forcing opposing teams to guard the three-point arc rather than sagging down to defend the post.
Smith has stepped up when the Trojans need him most.
With Cal playing tough zone defense, and Vucevic sidelined by foul trouble for much of the game, Smith made 8-of-12 three-pointers for a career-high 24 points in 29 minutes, scoring 12 consecutive points for the Trojans at one point.
While in hostile Allen Fieldhouse, competing against third-ranked Kansas, Smith provided veteran leadership, pacing USC with 20 points.
Smith made five three-pointers against Northern Arizona, and accounted for more than one-third of USC’s offense.
“He is a lot more confident,” Vucevic said. “He is not afraid to shoot.”
Smith is one of three seniors on the Trojans’ roster, and only senior guard Marcus Simmons has been at USC longer. Before the season, O’Neill announced that Smith would be a captain. Smith has proven to be a leader, accepting a role off the bench while freshman guard Maurice Jones and transfer Fontan started over him.
The Trojans have eight games remaining in the regular season, beginning on Thursday at the Galen Center against Oregon State, as well as the Pac-10 conference tournament. USC has lost five of its last seven games, and needs to finish the season strong to have an opportunity to continue the season into late March.
Despite the recent losing skid, Smith still has unwavering faith in his role on the team, and that the Trojans will play better.
“I’m going to do the same thing, bring energy and make big plays for us,” Smith said.

When you hear the word meditation, you might picture a monk living in some sunless mountain cave, secluded from the world.
But meditation can be a great form of relaxation for a student who is stressed out about papers and midterms.
Heather Lee | Daily Trojan
Most students have a clear picture of meditation in their minds. “[It’s] just closing your eyes and clearing your mind,” said Omar Merchant, a senior majoring in biology.
Meditation deals with your mind and its processes.
Adam Burke, a research psychologist and assistant professor at San Francisco State University says that “Meditation is the study of attention. Attention is a cognitive phenomenon. Meditation is the capacity of the brain to attend to something over a period of time.”
Some might think meditation is a form of worship or is linked to religion.
But the truth is meditation is quite removed from religion or any other set of organized beliefs.
Meditation should not be confused with contemplation, which is the act of thinking about concepts and the superficial aspects of life. Instead, meditation aims to go beyond the superficial and to delve into the subconscious.
The term meditation is often used to describe the process of simply forgetting about your worries and escaping reality for a while.
“[I] make time for myself and go to the art museum, my secret place on campus where I can escape,” said Matthew Arkfeld, a freshman majoring in East Asian languages and cultures.
When performed regularly, meditation, in any form, has many benefits.
Meditating helps the different hormones in the brain reach equilibrium. It also increases the levels of serotonin, which influences mood and behavior, thus aiding anger management and giving you a happy feeling.
For USC students, access to programs and classes on meditation is as easy as walking into the Lyon Center. The Lyon Center holds various programs for yoga, meditation and even counseling.
There is also the USC Yoga and Service Club, which holds events for the USC community, as well as for local schools.
Although it might take some time to clear your mind and adopt an attitude that is conducive to reaching emotional and physical stability, it is definitely a beneficial habit.
Meditating calms and focuses the mind, which would otherwise be crowded with millions of to-dos and what-ifs. Many devotees have even experienced a resolution of phobias.
Physically, meditation has  proven to be very important in post-operative healing — especially for those with heart problems and chronic illnesses.
Meditation allows people to go beyond their initial perceptions, giving those who meditate deeper opinions and greater wisdom and understanding.
Dr. Jatin Shah, chief of service in urgent care and a USC Emergency Clinic physician said he has been meditating before bed for the past four years and recommends the practice. Meditating before bed has been shown to improve sleeping habits and lead to deeper and more restful sleep.
Alternatively, concentrating on breathing in the morning allows for improved lung usage  throughout the day.
Breathing lets the air reach all organs in order to remove toxins from the muscles and blood. This detoxification creates a stronger immune system and a healthier body.
Yet the process of meditation is not a simple one.
“Bear in mind that complete relaxation cannot be achieved in just one attempt,” Shah said. “It takes a while to perfect [the meditative state],” Shah said.
Meditation does not mean instant peace of mind. Rather, it means the beginning of a long process of gaining inner peace.
“It’s just a matter of if you have the time and patience to put into it,” said Namrata Abhyankar, a freshman film and television production major. 
Though it might take some time to clear your mind and adopt an attitude that is conducive to reaching emotional and physical stability, you won’t regret the benefits in the end.
Physical education classes can be found in the USC Catalogue, at web-app.usc.edu/soc.

Recent episodes of Glee have lacked the uniquely endearing qualities found in the show’s first season.
But the post-Super Bowl episode, on the other hand, which aired immediately after the game on Sunday, boasted a multitude of attention grabbing tactics while still maintaining the original integrity and priorities of the show. Glee is finally reclaiming its former glory.
The episode immediately catches our eyes and ears with the opening cheerleading number seguing into Katy Perry’s “California Gurls,” featuring fiery hula hoops, bras, electric blue wigs and BMX racers.
“We put stuff in there understanding that there are a lot of dudes who watch the Super Bowl,” co-creator Brad Falchuk told Entertainment Weekly, in regard to the extravagance, “So it was making sure that the dudes who refuse to watch Glee are like, Wait a second!”
If Katy Perry, cheerleader look-a-likes, daredevil antics and pyrotechnics don’t capture the attention of brawny sports fans, I don’t know what will.
The exploitation of sex appeal is always an effective tactic, especially in this case. Given that Super Bowl ratings have continuously risen over the last five years, the coveted post-game show is fortunate to have a large and easily accessible audience.
Since this is the time to impress, co-creator Ryan Murphy went all out, making this episode the largest production yet, investing three to five million dollars to produce the episode.
As entertaining as the sexy pop number is, the show also returned to its acclaimed originality through a multitude of dumb blonde jokes from Brittany (Heather Morris), overcoming the odds of the high school hierarchy and of course the classically sadistic Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch).
In a perfect example of Sylvester’s cruel yet humorous antics, the blood-thirsty cheerleading coach uses sharp dialogue to convince Brittany to perform a dangerous stunt at the national cheerleading competition.
“If you don’t climb in that cannon, then that routine will be all boom boom and no pow, and that Brittany is so two thousand and late,” Sylvester says.
When school officials prove unwilling to put a student’s life at risk, Sue embarks on a screaming rampage cut to the tune of Mozart’s “O Fortuna.”
For self-proclaimed gleeks and new viewers alike, this act in itself is Glee perfection.
As entertaining as Sylvester’s suggestive and hysteric cheerleaders are, the show delves into deeper themes of discovering oneself against all odds.
For instance, lead football player and bully Karofsky (Max Adler) struggles to maintain his manliness and popularity as a cover for his true sexual orientation and desire to perform.
This just goes to show that Glee is more than a bunch of high school kids parading around while singing and dancing. The show delves into the deep emotional conflict that closeted gays face when small town societal expectations are against them.
In terms of musical performances, Rachel (Lea Michele) and Puck (Mark Salling) stand out. The two perform a beautifully harmonic rendition of Lady Antebellum’s “Need You Now” in an effort to strip the critical football players of their ignorance and give them insight into the true workings of the glee club.
The combination of Puck’s deep and alluring vocals with Rachel’s angelically soft soprano allows the football players and the audience to get blissfully lost in the moment. But in the typical Glee fashion, chaos comically persists between the two opposing forces.
While “Need You Now” serves as a sweet and tender moment of chemistry, the “Thriller” and “Heads Will Roll” mash-up of classic Michael Jackson and new wave Yeah Yeah Yeahs served as a perfectly over-the-top crowd pleaser.
The a capella group and athletes put their differences aside and overcome adversity to perform an enthusiastic, extravagant, zombie-themed number.
In essence, this epic performance elevated the episode to new heights of outlandishness. The episode will likely rank among the finest of the season.
This beautifully crafted and perfectly elaborate episode touches on feelings of closeted homosexuality, the meaning of masculinity, following your true passion and so forth.
Though the idea of a peaceful co-existence between different cliques in high school is nice, a hierarchy will still always exist.
Still, Glee provides us with a much needed escapist opportunity to believe otherwise.
Wow really?  Is this important to anyone?
When are you going to start covering important things like the way that USC is stealing community radio station KUSF from San Francisco?  Are you afraid that reporting on this would upset your slave masters?
Wake up and see what your school is doing to San Francisco.
Glee is the new “Fame”!
Should have mentioned the fact that the GLEE cast performed the halftime show with the Trojan Marching Band!!!!

Last March, Kathryn Bigelow made history by becoming the first woman ever awarded the Oscar for Best Director.
As 2010 was only the fourth time a woman had even been nominated, it was a momentous occasion for women in the film industry. And yet this year’s Oscar nominees, however, reveal that little has truly changed following Bigelow’s historic win.
The male-heavy list of Oscar hopefuls reflects the troubling behind-the-times state of Hollywood.
This year, like 79 of the other 83 years in Oscar history, there are no women nominated for the directing category. Five of the 10 Best Picture nominees have a woman among the Academy’s listed producers, but each has only one.
There are no female cinematographers and very few women in the editing, sound and visual effects categories. Art Direction and Costume Design are by far the most female-heavy categories. All this is business as usual at the Academy.
Lisa Cholodenko, director and co-writer of the The Kids Are All Right, and Debra Granik, director and co-writer of Winter’s Bone, make up the strongest female showing this year.
Each of their films received four nominations: Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor and Best Screenplay (Original for Kids, Adapted for Winter’s Bone). These are the only two films in the Screenplay categories with female writers.
The fact that so few women were nominated for Oscars might not reflect well on the Academy, but it also reflects poorly on the state of the industry.
Women can’t be nominated for Best Director if there are no women directing major films.
According to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, women directed seven percent of the top 250 domestic grossing films in 2009, the last year for which the center has data.
In the top 250 grossing films of 2009, women represented only 16 percent of all directors, executive producers,producers, writers, cinematographers and editors.
Interestingly, the number of women in these important positions is almost 10 percent higher in independent films that appear at U.S. festivals.
Both Winter’s Bone and The Kids Are All Right are small, low-budget indie flicks that were able to quietly infiltrate the mainstream market.
These two films offer strong female roles (as proven by their Best Actress nominations) and stories that revolve around flawed, realistic women struggling to keep their families together.
Stories like these, created by women, are much more common in the indie scene. It appears studios are rarely willing to back female filmmakers, who are far more likely to provide positive representations of women, with the big budget that leads to box office success.
The dearth of women filmmakers and lack of positive female representation in popular movies is strikingly obvious in 2011.
Although superhero movies like The Green Hornet tend to relegate women to peripheral roles, the comedy scene is dominated by male-centric stories with female characters who offer nothing empowering to women viewers.
One of the most recent examples is the upcoming Just Go With It. The comedy stars Adam Sandler as a man who needs one hot actress (Jennifer Aniston) to pretend to be his wife to cover up a lie he told the younger hot actress (Brooklyn Decker).
In the Super Bowl spot trailer, the voice-over instructs the presumably male viewer, “Tell your girlfriend it’s a romantic comedy,” as a very busty blonde in a bikini wades out of the water.
Forgetting for a moment that the movie looks lackluster, the blatant objectification of both women in the trailer alone exemplifies the Hollywood chauvinism that is so common to male-produced studio fare.
There are some doing their best to put a solid dent in the industry’s seemingly indestructible glass ceiling.
Natalie Portman told Vogue in January that her new production company, Handsomecharlie Films, will focus on Judd Apatow-esque comedies for women.
Natalie Portman, who said she wants to make "Judd Apatow comedies for women," was nominated for Best Actress - Photo courtesy of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
Portman acknowledges the need to counter male filmmakers’ tendency to objectify women, saying, “There’s a difference between being in a bra and underpants as an object on a men’s-magazine cover and playing yourself — a woman with desires and needs who loves and laughs with her friends — in a bra and underpants.”
It is important that women see themselves through female eyes as more than just the object of a man’s affection, but it won’t happen until there is a drastic change in Hollywood.
We need more women writing, directing, producing, photographing and editing the films people see, not just the ones at the festivals and art house theaters.
Women from Bigelow to Cholodenko to Portman are starting to clear the path to a strong female presence in the industry, but there’s still a long way to go before that glass ceiling breaks.

After the success of Cut Copy’s second album In Ghost Colours in 2008, the Australian indie-pop group had a lot to live up to.
In Ghost Colours was a unique take on electronic dance-rock, with light, catchy melodies backed by thick textures of bass, guitar and analog synthesizers.
Taking over · The newest Cut Copy album Zonoscope shows a break from the band’s  usual style but also a progression that might make their sound reach out to a wider audience. - Photo courtesy of Punkdafunk 
Cut Copy’s new album, Zonoscope, is a more mature response to In Ghost Colours.
Although staying true to its electro-pop roots, Cut Copy has created music that might be more accessible to listeners.
Zonoscope draws the listener in with entrancing rhythms and pulsating guitars, and keeps them listening with unexpected flashes of synth magic.
The opening track, “Need You Now,” hooks listeners with a heavy bass and light keyboard work beneath front man Dan Whitman’s voice and.
It is reminiscent of tracks from ‘80s pop bands like the Talking Heads.
Though six minutes long, this catchy, multi-layered track is the perfect introduction to the album.
With the influence of mixer Ben Allen, who has worked with bands such as Matt and Kim and Animal Collective, Zonoscope spans an eclectic 11 tracks.
You can hear Allen’s influence throughout the album. “This Is All We’ve Got” is reminiscent of Animal Collective’s “Taste,” beginning with bright synth effects and hazy vocals.
Whitman’s distinct voice and the weightless layering of sounds, however, help maintain the same uncluttered sound Cut Copy introduced with In Ghost Colours.
An effortless combination of relaxation and rhythm, carried over from In Ghost Colours, will keep fans of Cut Copy’s previous album listening.
Tracks like “Where I’m Going” and “Take Me Over” showcase bouncy melodies over more complicated drum beats and synth patterns.
The construction of these tracks lends a danceable vibe to the music.
The synths in particular add a twisted, ‘80s verve.
Listeners will be reminded of Cut Copy’s roots in the former decade with this album.
Aural nods to bands like Men At Work are present throughout Zonoscope.
“Blink and You’ll Miss a Revolution,” an infectious track infused with heavy drum beats and fresh electro sonics, almost sounds like a collaborative work with Colin Hay.
While channeling songs from the 80s, Cut Copy keeps its distinct sound with unexpected moments of textural clarity and genuine breaks from its intense electro-pop sound.
With shimmering synths and wordless vocals, the song is a break from the complexity of the preceding tracks.
The two-minute mixture of dreamy instrumentals smoothly transitions from the super-sweet ending of “Blink And You’ll Miss A Revolution” and melts into future tracks such as “This Is All We’ve Got.”
Cut Copy is less successful when straying far from its indie-pop roots.
“Alisa” is the least complex track on the album, with the guitar as the dominant instrument.
Although decorated with swaying electric additions for a powerful texture, “Alisa” fails to deliver the same energy or captivating quality as the other tracks do.
And similarly sedated in tempo, “Hanging Onto Every Heartbeat” is a more successful exploration of simple sounds, carrying the audience into a sea of swaying synths and cool, catchy melodies.
The album ends with a 15-minute track, “Sun God.” For an hour-long album, having the closing song take up nearly a quarter of it seems an ambitious endeavor.
Lengthy as it is, however, “Sun God” concentrates all of Cut Copy’s best elements into one track.
The bursting electronic intro, which continues underneath the ghostly reiterations of “love won’t be enough,” eases you into a hypnotizing 15 minutes.
“Sun God” is still less captivating than shorter, catchier tracks like “Need You Now” and “Where I’m Going,” but for a listening experience during which you simply want to get lost in the music, the track is perfect.
Slated to play at Coachella, Cut Copy has added more facets to its music, and such tonal and instrumental variation will likely enhance its stage performance.
Though it lacks some of the freshness of In Ghost Colours, the experimentation of Zonoscope yields an album that successfully hybridizes electro-pop, classic rock and indie rock like few who have come before.

Plastic bottles are not glamorous. Though Smartwater and its disciples have done their best to streamline the image and make water bottles into yoga-evoking, electrolyte-containing accessories, most are, at the end of the day, kind of ugly.
You do not see Kate Winslet walking down the red carpet at the Academy Awards clutching a Dasani.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
But in the 2011 award season, plastic bottles found their way into the spotlight after all.
Both the Grammys and the Oscars will be instituting several sustainable practices: The venues will serve organic food, and the live broadcasts will run exclusively on renewable energy, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Almost every aspect of the events is going green. And the red carpets, though still technically red, will be made from recycled water bottles.
It waxes a little stunted and superficial at first. A recyclable red carpet reads kitschy, not revolutionary. But as part of a larger trend, the impact of those water bottles is actually becoming tangible.
It’s been beaten to death that as go celebrities, so goes the nation. If Angelina Jolie likes philanthropy and large amounts of children, so do we. These days, it’s chic to volunteer.
Sustainable practices in high-profile events have been cropping up with increasing regularity across the nation.
Both the last Republican and Democratic National Conventions made a point of recycling and utilizing alternative energy. The 2010 Vancouver games were carbon neutral.
Super Bowl XLV was, thanks to off-sets, the greenest championship game in NFL history, though amid the deafening chants to “Black and Yellow” remixes, that one did go more or less unnoticed.
The point is, sustainability is moving into the public eye, not only with the occasional publicity stunt, but in globally broadcast media events, where its presence can actually effect change.
Going green on this scale results in more than just a cleaner conscience — the amount of energy expended in a single Super Bowl could power approximately 1,500 homes for a full year. It seems desirable that that amount of energy come from wind and not from coal.
Last year’s Academy Awards show was watched by 41.3 million people. The average Super Bowl these days reaches about 100 million. It’s hard to put a cap on the impact of name-dropping wind energy and recycling at events like those.
So the next move for sustainability on Oscar and Grammy night would be to increase how much we talk about it.
This is not to say that James Franco should interrupt an Anne Hathaway wardrobe-malfunction joke to explain the benefits of renewable energy. Viewers would be annoyed, Anne Hathaway would be annoyed and even clean energy companies would probably be annoyed, because the Academy Awards viewers include their target demographic too.
Sustainabilty is not what people turn on the TV to see, but there’s no reason they can’t see a little of it.
The average person watching the Oscars, Grammys, Super Bowl or Olympics might never know about the event’s carbon offsets if they’re not mentioned at least once or twice on air.
Topping a pastry at the Oscars with a locally grown strawberry will not decrease our CO2 emissions, but if enough people are talking, the chain reaction of sustainable practices from the publicity it precipitates actually might.
An eco-friendly red carpet at such an event is the environment’s equivalent of product placement. Though it’s hardly what everyone will tune in for, if it’s viewed, blogged about and especially mentioned in the live coverage, many more people will remember it when they reflect on the ceremony.
Those plastic water bottles are looking more glamorous every day.

Much of what the “greenies” promote is pure, unadulterated, politically correct, non-science based dreck. (For instance, replacing light bulb with the new versions that are dangerous and toxic when broken. Brilliant!) And some of their dreck is downright dangerous. (For instance, how many Third World deaths are directly attributable to pseudo-science regarding DDT? Answer: a lot).

Although the media might have led us to believe the Egypt crisis is under control, the truth is young people in the United States must take a stand on this issue — it is perhaps more critical now than ever before.
In response to the demonstrations in Egypt, some critics are concerned the situation in Egypt will result in something similar to the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Unlike the radical Islamic movement that led the revolution in Iran, however, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is a social religious movement that supports a democratic government in Egypt. If a democracy is to flourish in Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood must be allowed to compete for power.
Contrary to what some skeptics believe, however, the Muslim Brotherhood has not played a significant role in the demonstrations. It was the enlightened youth who began the protests Jan. 25 and who are continuing to lead them.
Hosni Mubarak has said he will work on constitutional reform and legislation in hopes of settling the unrest. He has appointed his first successor and put a brand new cabinet in place. The Egyptian people, however, believe his attempts are too little, too late.
At this moment, the only clear path to achieving transparent elections in September is to establish a legitimate transitional government. The Obama administration has shown support for newly appointed vice president, Omar Suleiman, Mubarak’s righthand man and the CIA’s point man for Egyptian rendition. This is what most Egyptians do not want: the same military dictatorship hidden behind a slightly prettier face.
The United States is attempting to install a strongman, and that has the capacity to create conditions for a secular democracy.
But what the Egyptian people need is an organic democracy, not a chemically induced one.
This is not to say there should be an election now; Egypt has neither the institutions nor the political leadership to ensure a smooth transition. If it did, protestors would not be out on the streets.
But there are alternatives. Democracy advocate, Nobel laureate and former IAEA leader, Mohammed ElBaradei, has just returned to Egypt, and by gaining support from the Muslim Brotherhood, could prove an exceptional candidate for achieving a national unified government.
Egyptian leaders should take one thing into account: Two-thirds of the entire Arab population is under 30 years old — and look at all the changes they are making.
It is our responsibility in the United States, as members of the younger generation, to speak out, whether by participating in protests inspired by the Egyptian revolution, writing to our members of Congress or merely changing our Facebook statuses to express our solidarity.
The repressed people are relying on us to amplify their voices, and who else better with our advanced technological and networking skills to expand this revolt for liberation, human rights and self-determination?
Whatever the case may be, as students of a highly recognized research university, we need to look beyond what is fed to us by the mainstream media.
Nesma Tawil is a junior majoring in political science and international relations.
For more stories on the crisis in Egypt, click here. 
Nesma,
Small detail (just between me and you):
Hezbollah and Hamas was said to be social movements just as you call the Muslim Bortherhood.
Problem is, now that Hezbollah and Hamas are in power it’s hard to tell the difference between then and Al Qaeda.
Could youn describe “social movement” for us.  TIA
Very, very….very good point
Nesma writes, “…however, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is a social religious movement that supports a democratic government in Egypt. ”
That’s a good one!  SNL needs more writers like you.
Here’s my take on it, though:
The only way for the people of the Middle East (all of Islam for that matter) to experience true democracy is to free themselves from the shackles of Islam.
Islam and democracy are incompatible and anyone who says Indonesia is an example they are simply showing just how dire Islamic democracies are.
Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Jordan, Oman, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Mauritania, Niger, Algeria, Somalia, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kirgizstan, etc…
Name one country from this or any list of Islamic dominated countries where one can freely criticize Islam, convert from Islam, proselytize for any other religion, draw pictures of Mohammed, criticize Saudi Arabia, openly practice homosexuality or Judaism, be a free woman with all this implies.
So please don’t blame Egypt’s problems on America. I would bet money that if America could foster true democracy in any Muslim country it would, just as it fostered freedoms and democracy in Germany and Japan after WWII.
Quit blaming their problems on anyone but them and their backwards-looking religion.
Finally, let me say, Mohammed was Islam’s first political leader. He refused to acknowledge a separation of mosque and state as Jesus did (Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar’s…). Mohammed was a theocratic despot who killed, raped, enslaved and pillaged his way to power and wealth.
This is who Muslims look to for direction, no? Not to America, but to Mohammed and therein lies the tale of the tape.
Once again, it is asserted by the actions of USA and Israel that democracy in certain parts of the world is not in the best interests of the USA and Israel.” While it will be readily admitted that the current regimes in the Middle East suppress freedom, these regimes are believed to also suppress a far worse alternative: the radicals and fundamentalists who might win democratic elections. The message is clear from USA and Israel. It is better to deal with a Middle Eastern dictatorship that is the friend of USA and Israel than a democratic regime that is their enemy. One thing is for sure this development in Egypt will prove many points and illusions to the Arab world that, USA will support democracy in Middle East only for material gains. As long as they have the Arab Kings and dictators who play puppets to USA and serve their cause with regards to Israel they will close the eyes on the atrocities committed by them. Time for the whole Arab to wake up and realize the intentions of USA and Israel. Call for liberation from the monarchism and dictatorships and strive in the way of popular governments through democracy
Egypt needs to sort out its own problems…..The more we help other nations, the more we are hated for trying to help!!!!…..They want our monitary contributions, but that is about it.
The cat is the cat. Dog is dog. The Muslim Brotherhood is extremist, nobody can’t argue, but it hides its true role now. Everybody knows it. Very dangerous if you try to play with a tiger.

[…] and communicating people. Two-thirds of Egypt’s population is under 30 years old (as reported here) and has been using sites, like Twitter, to call for support and additional protesters. The […]

All eyes were fixated on Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Sunday, as the Green Bay Packers faced the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, becoming the most watched Super Bowl in NFL history.
Aaron Rodgers, who was later named the game’s MVP, led the Packers with three touchdown passes, defeating the Steelers 31-25 to record the franchise’s fourth Super Bowl championship and first since 1997.
The win marked Rodgers’ first Super Bowl title win, but also carried some significance for some former USC players.
Starting at linebacker for Green Bay, Clay Matthews, a former walk-on for the Trojans, finished with three tackles and proved instrumental in the waining moments.
As the Steelers were trying to mount a comeback during the fourth quarter, Matthews created a forced fumble from Rashard Mendenhall that subsequently turned into a touchdown, extending Green Bay’s lead to 11.
Matthews also finished second in the voting for defensive player of the year.
Former USC running back Chad Morton is also a special teams assistant for the Packers.

14-year-old quarterback prospect David Sills, who committed to USC a year ago, received a scholarship offer from Auburn recently, his personal coach Steve Clarkson told Eric Sondheimer of the Los Angeles Times on Monday.
Since the age of 9, Sills, a native of Delaware, has trained with Clarkson, one of the country’s premier quarterback developers, who has tutored players such as Ohio State’s Terrelle Pryor and the Pittsburgh Steelers’ Ben Roethlisberger. Clarkson has also instructed former USC quarterbacks Matt Cassel and Matt Leinart, as well as current Trojan signal caller Matt Barkley.
Despite Sills’ young age, Clarkson has continued to insist that the now-14-year-old is on track to match or even better the success of his predecessors.
“His skill set is off the chart,” Clarkson told reporters last February. “I’ve never seen anyone at his age do what he’s been able to do. He’s already six feet as a 13-year old,” Clarkson said. “And he’s breaking down NFL footage.”
The commitment between Sills and USC is nonbinding until he signs a letter of intent, which he is not eligible to do so until February 2015. And yes, that’d be 2015.
Oh please and academics matter and USC… keep telling that to all the fake gang banger convict student athletes that could only make it into a football factory. What is the graduation rate for football players at USC.. Ummmm a big 54% hahaha yeah academics matter alright! way to go SO CAL and your high standards. You guys wouldnt welcome any of these kids around your v-neck sweaters or white table cloths any other day but saturday and you know it
Hmm. No mention of academics. Guess that doesn’t matter.
Of course academic don’t matter…not at Auburn anyway.

The presidential ticket of Alex Fadil and Rohan Mehra is the first to post a video, which they did on their website today.
In the one-minute video, they discuss their backgrounds at USC, their reasons for running and said their plan to make listening to students a priority.
“In our time here we’ve developed a deep sense of dedication to the students, faculty and administration,” Mehra said in the video. “We’ve had countless opportunities and unforgettable memories thanks to this university.”
The video also highlighted their involvement with the Greek, academic and philanthropic communities at USC.
“We want to represent you, the students, with all your questions, concerns and suggestions, so we can advocate them to the administration,” Fadil said.

USG has changed its strategy to get more students to vote in its election Feb. 15-17.
They are hoping to get 6,000 students to vote, over one third of the undergraduate population, and about 1,500 more votes than last year.
Current President Chris Cheng won last year’s election by 2,100 votes, 671 more than his closest competitor, and 4,551 students voted for one of the presidential tickets in 2009-10.
“This year we’re going to actively campaign for people to vote,” said Liz Trower, Senior Director of Communication for USG. “In the past, we mostly left election publicity up to candidates, who would campaign to certain groups.”
USG sponsored some nighttime events, which Trower said were poorly-attended.
Now, events will be during peak traffic times. There will be food trucks from 11:30 to 2 p.m. at the Tommy Trojan poll during all three days of voting.
“We’re offering incentives just to get people to vote,” Trower said. “We’re not giving incentives for them to vote for any particular candidate.”
The voting polls located at the Lyon Center, Finger Fountain, Student Union Kiosk and Leavey Library will all have free pizza as well.
Students can also vote online on the elections website, which will have information about the candidates uploaded soon.

Tables with campaign logos promoting the Eric Burse and Andy Greos presidential ticket were removed from the front of the campus center today.
The tables were put up by 9:15 a.m. and taken down by 10:00 a.m. after campus center officials requested that they be removed.
“It wasn’t specifed in the elections code about the campus center being a neutral place, but the people in charge of the campus center just wanted it to remain a neutral zone,”  Burse said.
The elections code has a clause stating that materials should not be posted on campus and university-owned buildings, but USG had no comment regarding the tables.
Burse and Greos still intend to use the tables in areas designated for campaigning.
“We have them back and we’re just going to use them in other locations,” Burse said.

After a whirlwind year filled with scholarship reductions and a bowl ban, USC has almost become synonymous with the word “sanctions” in the sports world.
Now, as the university awaits word from the NCAA infractions committee on its appeal, the athletic department is taking steps to create an open dialogue between the collegiate and professional sports communities on how to best handle agents.
USC will host the “Agent Awareness, Education and Eligibility Summit” tomorrow at the Galen Center, an invitation-only event that will feature representatives from the NCAA, Pac-10, SEC, NFL and NFL Players Association.
Athletic directors from each of the Pac-10 schools will also be in attendance, along with notable agents.
“Obviously, the issue of college student-athletes dealing with agents is a hot-button topic,” said USC athletic director Pat Haden in a statement released by the university. “We at USC know that first hand. We decided to organize this summit so that all of us at USC can pick the brains of our peers throughout the Pac-10 and also hear from those on the firing lines at the NCAA and Pac-10, at the NFL and within the agent community.”
Haden will attend the summit along with university President C. L. Max Nikias, Vice President for Athletic Compliance Dave Roberts and Senior Associate Athletic Director Mark Jackson.
“Our goal is to gain valuable input in this area as we move forward here at USC, and also to provide a constructive dialogue and exchange of ideas between all of the participants,” Haden said.
Last June, the NCAA levied severe sanctions on USC, stating the university had a “lack of institutional control” over its athletic programs after it was determined that former basketball standout O.J. Mayo and football star Reggie Bush received improper benefits while attending USC.

Spring is almost upon us, and at USC the new season means a fresh start for Undergraduate Student Government.
Already we can see campaign posters budding in the grass along Trousdale; that’s because last night at midnight the campaigns began, and the candidates for the upcoming elections were ready to disperse their fresh slogans and cardboard cut-outs.
For the next two weeks, presidential and senatorial candidates will be making their names known and showing their political mettle through debates, rallies and speeches. The presidential debate will be held tomorrow, in the Forum at 8 p.m. Candidates will be making speeches and discussing their plans for the 2011-12 season, and explaining why they should be picked to represent current Trojans.
It will be hard not to notice the campaign proceedings with the ads placed around campus, and with twenty senatorial candidates and three presidential-vice presidential tickets, the buzz will be endless. Even if you don’t have any friends running, by next week you will have some of the candidates’ names branded into your memory.
“Elections are a great way for students to assert themselves and show their involvement. This isn’t high school government, it’s college, and that means the people you vote for will actually be able to affect your life at USC,” said Samantha Fabiano, a member of the Leadership Funds Committee for USG.
Voting takes place Feb. 15 – 17.

With the first day of campaigning underway, candidates are already trying to make their marks on campus.
Trousdale is covered with posters representing the different presidential tickets, and it seems to be attracting the attention of the student body.
“I was walking on Trousdale and saw all of the signs so it made me want to check out the debate that’s coming up,” said Diana Troung, a senior majoring in biology. “I think there needs to be more of a commitment to being aware of issues on campus.”
Another student was immersed into the election scene during his breakfast at Parkside.  Michael Garrett, an undeclared freshman, said he was excited a candidate took time out of a busy schedule to personally address issues.
“A candidate came up to me during breakfast and it was really cool,” Garrett said. “I really don’t know much about the campaigns, but I am definitely going to vote because I want to help out campus.”
Some students, however, do not believe USG have a huge impact on the student body.
“I just don’t know if being president or vice president is incredibly important,” said Dana Horowitz, a sophomore majoring in English. “Chris [Cheng, USG president] and Nehi [Ogbevoen, USG vice president] are great, but I don’t really see what USG does.”

According to Hollywood industry blog Deadline Hollywood, 20th Century Fox has chosen Shawn Levy to direct its remake of the 1966 science fiction film Fantastic Voyage. 
 
Produced by James Cameron, the film will be a CGI and 3D reinterpetration of the journey of shrunken scientists travelling through the human body.
Levy has some very commercially successful remakes already under his belt, such as Cheaper by the Dozen and The Pink Panther. Most known for the Ben Stiller family film Night at the Museum, however, one will have to wonder how he will reimagine the campy classic.
Levy’s last film, Real Steel, is still in post production, and features Hugh Jackman in an action-packed role as a boxing trainer in a future that pits giant humanoid robots against one another in elaborate battles. The release date has been set for October of this year.
According to the same Deadline report, Levy was approached after directors Darren Aranofsky, Timur Bekmambetov, Jonathan Mostow and Louis Leterrier, who helmed Black Swan, Wanted, Surrogates and Clash of the Titans respectively.
No release date has been announced for Fantastic Voyage.

Within a week of Meg and Jack White of The White Stripes calling it quits, LCD Soundsystem announced their last show will be performed April 2 in Madison Square Garden.
This disco house meets funky, new wave band stated on its official website, “gettin’ out. movin’ on. but for just one more night, we will be playing with friends and family for nearly 3 hours–playing stuff we’ve never played before and going out with a bang. and we’d like you to be there. if you would, we’d love it if people all came in white. or black. or black and white. and come ready to have fun, please. and come early, as the festivities will be opened by our favorites, liquid liquid. yes: liquid liquid. if it’s a funeral, let’s have the best funeral ever!!!”
It is sad indeed that we would lose the innovative creators of hits such as “Daft Punk is Playing at my House” and “Tribulations,” but all good things must come to an end and it’s respectable that they’re choosing to do so on a high note.
For disappointed listeners, now is the time to reminisce on the good times (Coachella 2010 anyone?) and take advantage of the time we have left.  At the very least, it’s a good excuse to make a trip to the Big Apple.
