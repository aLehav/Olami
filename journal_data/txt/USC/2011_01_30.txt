The No. 3 USC women’s swimming and diving team traveled to Northern California this weekend with the goal of beating top-ranked Stanford and Cal in two dual meets.
Unfortunately, for the Women of Troy (8-2, 2-2) they were handed two back-to-back losses instead.
On Friday, Cal (5-0, 3-0) had the upper hand in almost all races.
The Golden Bears set a pool record at home in the 400y medley relay and finished off their win when the Cal freshmen finished 1-2-3 in the 200y backstroke.
With that loss behind them, the team went on to face No. 1 Stanford Saturday, who ended up winning 161.5-136.6.
“The women came away with two tough losses against two of the absolute best teams in college swimming,” USC coach Dave Salo told the team’s website. “Each loss came down to missed opportunities in several very tight races. I am certain what we learned this weekend on the road will better prepare us to compete well at the Pac-10 Championships.”
While the team as a whole did not find very much success in this weekend’s competitions, there were several swimmers who performed well against the Golden Bears and the Cardinal.
Sophomore Haley Anderson won two events in each of the meets: the 1000y free and the 500y free.
Senior co-captain Lyndsay DePaul, junior Katinka Hosszu and freshman Kasey Carlson also won one event each against Cal and Stanford, but these individual efforts were not enough in the end to defeat the two powerhouse schools.
Even with their two losses, senior co-captain Presley Bard expressed confidence in the team’s abilities to do better next time.
“It’s hard that we lost and it’s really tough to deal with … but we just have to take the positives from it,” Bard said. “Not everything always goes as planned and not everything goes well. You gotta roll with the punches and swim as fast as you can.”
The Women of Troy will host UCLA at their last dual meet of the season Feb. 12 at noon.

The Galen Center hosted the Eighth Council District Peoples’ Convention on Sunday afternoon in anticipation of the upcoming City of Los Angeles Municipal elections on March 8.
The convention, which was organized by a grassroots community organization called Eighth District Grassroots Rising, brought together community activists, residents and leaders from various community interest groups in order to prepare a “people’s agenda” for action to be taken in the district.
Attendees of the convention listened to several speakers and engaged in direct discussion surrounding shared concerns and possible solutions for community issues. One of the central ideas of the convention regarded the community’s overall disappointment with city leadership and how to improve the current situation through active involvement.
“We can no longer sit by and expect other folks to take care of our business,” said Rev. William Smart of the EDGR. “We have to be the instigators of action.”
For many at the convention, the key to increasing the condition of their neighborhoods is to involve themselves directly in the city and take an active role in governmental affairs to bring about changes at a community level.
“Proper representation is not about city council telling us what we need or what we want, it is about us telling them,” said Shawn Simons, president of the North Area Neighborhood Development Council.
Several speakers stressed the need for holding their government and representatives accountable for their actions. Attendees voiced their frustration as well, many of them declaring that after all the problems that have plagued neighborhoods in the Eighth Council District, they have had enough.
“Our community struggles have been going on for a very long time,” said Lichelle Williams, a local resident. “We have seen city councilmen come and go in our community, but they have not brought any lasting change.”
Many of the concerns voiced at the convention included residents’ wishes to preserve their quality of life. Economic struggles were a common factor in the discussions, with several people expressing the community’s need for a more revitalized commercial presence.
“We have great residential areas, but the struggle tends to be the commercial corridor,” said Kokayi Kwa Jitahidi, the convention’s main speaker and an activist with the EDGR. “There’s a lack of business; for every five people who need a job in the Eighth Council District, there’s only one job available locally.”
Other issues that were brought up included prostitution in residential areas, home foreclosures, community redevelopment and the area’s educational system.
Despite the list of problems that are commonly associated with the neighborhoods that make up the Eighth Council District, those at the convention maintained that the area is home to vibrant communities that have the ability to progress upwards.
“We get all of this negative feedback, but at the end of the day, all of those statistics mean nothing if the people say we are not going to take this anymore and we deserve better,” Kwa Jitahidi said.
The speakers urged those in attendance to take action in order to bring their communities out of their struggles. Many explained that change starts with the people.
“We have become numb,” said Greg Akili of the EDGR. “We have become so accustomed to not having, that we think it’s the norm. We think that’s just how it is. It’s not that way and that is unacceptable.”
The convention encouraged community involvement through breakout sessions after the speakers in which groups of attendees voiced specific concerns and collaborated on possible solutions. Those concerns will be evaluated and complied into the people’s agenda by the EDGR, which will then host another meeting discussing the next steps leading up to the election.
“The work that is happening here goes beyond March 8, because if it stops then it is worth nothing,” Kwa Jitahidi said. “This is not just about one election; this is about a community getting its voice back.”
From the President’s letter (http://www.usfca.edu/Presidents_Letter_on_the_KUSF_Sale/):
Though KUSF started as a student-operated station, at the time of our decision to sell the frequency only about ten percent of the station’s volunteers were USF students. Regrettably, our on-campus listening audience was very small.  Only one academic course is offered in conjunction with the station, with just 12 students per semester.  In an era of difficult economic choices, we simply could not afford to continue subsidizing, with tuition dollars, a radio station whose primary focus was not our own students. What began as a student enterprise evolved over the years into a near-entitlement for the community.  It is important that KUSF remain a robust teaching and learning experience for USF.
KUSF isn’t going away, it’s going online… Makes very good sense to me…
If these people don’t come together to get rid of Parks then this was a wasted event and effort.
He’s been so horrible for the district in so many ways.
Speaking of community, was there any discussion about holding the USC President and Administration accountable for what their ‘community’ is doing to the San Francisco ‘community’ by stealing KUSF radio?  Does one ‘community’ have the right to damage another ‘community’ for the sake of blind profit? 
Trojans need to know what is going on.  This is a truly disgusting travesty.

The USC student body reflects a national trend of college students using mobile devices daily to access the Internet, and this has compelled Information Technology Services to improve its wireless coverage, according to Kevin Durkin, director of communication and marketing for Information Technology Services.
Technology · Phil Jones, a sophomore majoring in communications, uses his phone and iPod to access the Internet. Information Technology Services says wireless availability is a top concern on both USC campuses. - Alex Dealy | Daily Trojan 
The Educause Center for Applied Research, which provides research and analysis to universities to help them make better decisions on technology, recently released a report that found that during the last two years, the percentage of college students who use their phones to obtain daily access to the Internet has grown significantly.
Durkin said the increased use of mobile devices to access the USC wireless network has led to an increase in bandwidth demand on the network.
“It’s also due to the fact that students now use devices that take up much more bandwidth,” Durkin said. “Mobile devices that are used to download music, or upload pictures or videos to social networking sites take up a lot of bandwidth.”
Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred in a given period of time. The larger the number of people who are accessing the Internet to download items or play movies, the slower the bandwidth.
The large amount of smart phone technology and the increased demand for bandwidth led ITS to launch its wireless network upgrade initiative last August to increase the speed, capacity and area covered by the USC network.
“The goal of the initiative is to provide pervasive wireless coverage in the University Park and Health Sciences campuses,” Durkin said.
The high amount of network traffic has left some students with complaints about USC’s wireless network.
“I definitely think that the USC network needs to improve. I don’t even get good signal in my apartment,” said Denise Rick, an undeclared sophomore.
Each year, when ITS conducts its annual customer service survey, wireless availability is always a top concern, Durkin said.
The initial phase to upgrade its wireless network, which will be completed in the next several weeks, includes upgrading wireless connectivity in all academic buildings on both campuses to have the greatest impact on students
“The first phase of the project is almost 90 percent completed,” Durkin said. “The next phase will involve upgrading the surrounding areas of both campuses as well as 77 off-campus buildings.”
ITS’ next goal is to upgrade wireless connectivity in administrative buildings on campus. So far, 3,100 new access points have been installed on campus and are equipped with the technology that gives the wireless network the ability to handle a greater number of users.
All phases of the project will be completed in time for fall of 2011, according to Durkin.
Durkin said that since implementing the new wireless network, ITS has noticed that the bandwidth usage at the university almost tripled, which he attributed to the greater number of access points, the stronger signal strength and the greater coverage area of the network.
“The new, expanded wireless network infrastructure has been built to accommodate and sustain the growth in bandwidth usage by all members of the USC community, including students,” Durkin said.
Yili Shi, a junior majoring in business administration, said she has noticed the changes to the wireless network around campus.
“Last semester, there was a classroom in Hoffman Hall where I was never able to get a signal, but this semester I can access the network from the same classroom,” Shi said.
Not all students, however, are experiencing the benefits of the new USC wireless network.
“My AT&T 3G network is much faster than USC wireless, so for consistency I use my 3G network,” said Lily Muntzing, a sophomore majoring in communication. “It’s only in certain areas, like the basement of Annenberg, that I switch over to USC Wi-Fi because I can’t get signal on my phone’s network.”
Students who wish to check the status of a building’s wireless network upgrade can visit www.usc.edu/its.
We’re pretty far behind most public schools, so about time… I’ve noticed better coverage around University Village, but I’ve also noticed that connectivity in Kaprielian Hall is as bad as ever.

Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, commonly know as SETI, recently agreed to partner with USC to “pursue the study of the living universe.”
The SETI Institute is a non-profit organization that performs research and has a center for education and public outreach.
The collaboration will be effective immediately. As a result, USC will gain access to the Institute to embark on joint projects. According to Randolph Hall, Vice President of Research, involvement is expected from physics, astronomy, biology, electrical engineering, computer science, cinema and the Keck School of Medicine.
“USC and the SETI Institute have common interests in understanding life in all its forms, as well as communicating with students and the public on exciting scientific topics,” Hall wrote in an e-mail. “We are looking forward to starting joint research programs, education and internship opportunities for students, and creation of multimedia for science education.”
The idea of a collaboration emerged three months ago when Dr. David Agus, the director of the USC Center for Applied Molecular Medicine and the USC Westside Prostate Cancer Center, met with Jill Tarter, the Director of the Center for SETI Research at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif. at a conference. There, they talked about a possible collaboration between USC and SETI.
Although the exact details of the collaboration are not yet known, Hall and Dr. Seth Shostak, a senior astronomer at SETI, see benefits for both USC and SETI.
Although it is still in discussions, people from the SETI Institute might come teach classes at USC.
Research opportunities for the faculty will also be prevalent, and, if things go according to plan, so will undergraduate summer internships.
“There are a lot of things we do that might be of interest to some of the students and some of the faculty at USC,” Shostak said. “We’re also interested in the stuff that you do in film and television and that sort of thing because we do a lot of outreach here; there are television crews here all the time and it will be useful to have, for example, material made that illustrates the kind of work we do and whatever we’re doing with USC.”
One of the major shared interests is looking for microbial life in otherwise inhospitable environments.
For some students, the prospect of working with SETI is exciting.
“It would be really cool especially since I am a computer science major and SETI does things like listen to noise from the universe and try to find intelligent signals within that noise,” said Nakul Joshi, a freshman majoring in computer science.
Terrific idea. We obviously don’t have enough problems on Earth with other humans, so now let’s blow the taxpayer dollars inviting potentially hostile aliens to come visit!
How have some people gotten anywhere in life with this kind of logic?

Career Fest kicks off today, and seniors preparing their resumes and interview skills should know that job prospects for graduates with bachelor degrees should improve this year.
According to a survey from the National Association of Colleges and Employers, employers expect to hire about 13.5 percent more students this year than in 2010 overall and 22.5 percent more in the western region of the country.
Decisions · Kathryn Jacobsen, a junior majoring in political science, looks at some materials at the Career Planning and Placement Center. - Alex Dealy | Daily Trojan 
“We’ve had an increase in our fall on-campus recruiting this year,” said Lori Shreve Blake, director of Alumni and Student Career Services at the Career Planning and Placement Center. “For our graduates this year, we are characterizing the job market for recent graduates as good. Last year, we characterized the market as fair, but the economy is improving for us and there are jobs out there.”
Angie Sabido-Wood, director of Employer Relations and Research for CPPC, also said there seemed to be more recruiters with a larger number of positions to fill, compared to last year.
“The job offers that our advisers are seeing that students are coming in with are better as well,” Wood said. “We’re seeing signing bonuses, which we haven’t seen in a while. Last year things slumped a little and things are starting to look better.”
Wood also said USC didn’t experience as much of a recruiting drop as other campuses in the area.
“I don’t think we ever saw the drop in numbers [that they did],” she said. “We were still having successful career fairs but they weren’t experiencing as many recruiters coming to their campuses.”
In addition to USC’s high academic ratings — U.S. News & World Report ranks USC 23rd in the nation — the Trojan family is a factor for students getting jobs, according to Wood.
“We are lucky that we have such a tight network of family and friends at USC,” Wood said. “Obviously there are many factors. We have a very strong Trojan family and that does help our students, especially in Southern California.”
Alisa Scannell, a senior majoring in public policy, management and planning, said she feels confident about getting a job with a USC degree.
“One time I saw a new [real estate] developer looking for an intern on Craigslist and I e-mailed him. He e-mailed me back and told me he was also a USC graduate,” Scannell said. “I definitely feel like the fact that I went to USC helped get me that interview.”
As promising at the recruiting numbers are, Dr. Donald E Yett, professor of economics, advised students to take any future predictions with a grain of salt.
“Recoveries from big recession take a lot time,” he said. “California has had a higher unemployment rate than other areas in the country and there really is very, very little statistical evidence on changes in the markets for graduates in California recently.”

San Diego State University and Indiana University proved to be no match for the USC men’s tennis team, which steamrolled the competition to win the ITA Kickoff Weekend Saturday.
The No. 2 Trojans beat  San Diego State 7-0 and Indiana 6-1 to keep their unblemished record intact.
The Trojans looked strong in both singles and doubles, and the two-day tournament was an overall success for the team.
Come from behind · Junior Daniel Nguyen, along with freshman Emilio Gomez, picked up a thrilling doubles victory that helped lead the Trojans to victory over No. 47 Indiana Saturday at Marks Stadium. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan 
“I am really happy with the performance,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “[It’s] just good to have the whole team out there playing. We have had our issues in the last week and we are lucky we have so much depth to help us.”
In doubles action, the Trojans got off to a rough start, as the pair of No. 51 senior Jaak Poldma and sophomore J.T. Sundling fell to Indiana’s Jeremy Langer and Santiago Gruter, 8-3.
Junior Steve Johnson and freshman Ray Sarmiento managed to come away with an 8-2 victory over Indiana’s Josh MacTaggart and Stephen Vogl, and junior Daniel Nguyen and freshman Emilio Gomez came away with a thrilling 8-6 victory over Isade Juneau and Will Kendall.
The weekend’s matches also saw the return of senior Peter Lucassen.
“Peter didn’t [look] very comfortable in his return on Friday, but really got it going against Indiana,” Smith said. “He played with some great aggression … he just has to have the right mindset and he will be great.”
Lucassen fell to Aztecs’ Tim Schulz van Endert 6-1, 6-2 on Friday, but came up with a win against Indiana’s Isade Juneau with a decisive 6-1, 6-0 finish.
Even more important to the team’s success thus far, Smith has praised the play of several promising new freshmen.
“Our freshman Michael [Grant], [Sarmiento] and [Gomez] all played so well,” Smith said. “[It’s] just great to see them adjusting to college tennis and helping the team. As tough as it is to lose seniors, the great thing about coaching is to reinvent the team with new players.”
No. 4 Sarmiento defeated Indiana’s Claes Goransson 6-2, 6-0 while No. 6 Gomez took a 6-0, 6-1 victory against the Indiana’s Stephen Vogl.
With the wins, the Trojans earned a place in the ITA National Indoors Championship in Seattle next month.
Another home match awaits the Trojans against San Diego Friday at 1:30 p.m. at Marks Stadium, as they hope to continue their strong start to the season.
“We have some work to do in doubles,” Smith said. “Guys need to get comfortable with their partners, have a little more understanding with their shot selection and get more comfortable in their positioning.  We will work on it and get it down. That’s what the early part of the season is for.”

“Today was a wake-up call for us,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “We have to come out of the blocks early.”
Arizona State kept up its  relentless pressure defense throughout the first half, forcing USC into seven turnovers.
In fact, most of the halftime stats looked bleak for the Women of Troy.
They trailed 33-21, no player had recorded more than four points or four rebounds and the team had only shot 33 percent from the field.
“You have to tip your hats to Arizona State,” Cooper said. “I thought they came in with a game plan of being physical and aggressive, and they kind of took us out of our offensive sets in the first half.”
The start of the second half wasn’t much different, and when Arizona State guard Alex Earl made a three-pointer to put Arizona State up 53-42 with less than nine minutes remaining, it looked as though USC would suffer its first loss at home.
But the Women of Troy would not quit.
Instead, they used a 13-0 run, capped by a three-pointer by Corral, that gave them their first lead of the game.
But the lead was short-lived, as the Sun Devils went on a mini-run of their own to take a 62-60 lead with 24 seconds left.
USC junior forward Briana Gilbreath was fouled with 11 seconds left and calmly knocked down the first free throw to cut the lead to one point.
When her second free throw missed, chaos ensued.
There was a scramble for the loose ball and Arizona State ultimately gained possession.
USC fouled as soon as the ball was inbounded, which sent junior forward Kimberly Brandon to the line.
Though the Sun Devils had converted all 15 free throws they had taken up until that point, Brandon converted just one of two free throws, giving the Women of Troy one last chance to salvage their perfect home record and take sole possession of third place in the Pac-10.
But the team couldn’t quite pull off a buzzer-beater shot.
Corral took the inbound pass, weaved through several Arizona State defenders and took a hurried three-point attempt that fell just short of the net.
“It was an admirable effort on our behalf,” Cooper said. “We just have to regroup and come back with a big win next week.”
The loss puts USC into a three-way tie for third place with Arizona State and California, with half of the Pac-10 conference schedule remaining to be played.
The Trojans continue conference play on Feb. 6 at home against No. 11 UCLA.
“We’re going to need 40 minutes of [good] basketball, not one half,” Gilbreath said. “[UCLA] is going to come in here and play us just like Arizona State did. [They’re going to use] pressure, they’re going to get on the boards and do everything possible to win the game, so we have to do the same.”

Four-star offensive lineman Cyrus Hobbi (Scottsdale, Ariz.), the nation’s top guard prospect according to ESPN, announced his commitment to USC during a Friday afternoon press conference held at Saguargo High School and televised regionally on Fox Sports Arizona.
“I’ll be attending the University of Southern California,” Hobbi said in a story published on USCFootball.com. “It was a very difficult decision with all of the schools I had to choose from.”
Hobbi had been deliberating between USC, and Arizona State and UCLA.
“I was very impressed with all of the coaches and I had a great time meeting everybody, but at the end of the day going out there to USC,” Hobbi said in the same story. “I knew it was the place for me. Walking out to the Coliseum and seeing all of these great, great players I’m going to be playing with soon with the recruiting class they’re going to be getting … we’re going to be good in the next couple of years.”
With holes on the offensive line stemming from the departures of starters Kristofer O’Dowd, Butch Lewis and Tyron Smith, Hobbi is expected to compete for a starting spot immediately.
“We’re going to start winning games. I’m very confident and very excited in my decision to go to USC.”
John must be a Duck graduate.  Doesn’t know the difference between THREW and THROUGH.  Oregon also throws money at their recruits…. it;s called scholarships.  Note that Oregon was not in the mix of schools beng considerred.
GO DUCKS! Wonder how much money usc through at this kid?

Will UCLA catch up to USC?
We’ve been asking this for years now, and even as both programs inch closer to national signing day Wednesday, nothing indicates that such a scenario is on the horizon.
So the question has become, “Okay, will anything, even sanctions, derail the Trojans’ run of success?
That’s where we are now. It’s where we’ve been since June.
The advantage in terms of college football recruiting in Los Angeles has not tilted toward Westwood, and by now, that’s a rather puzzling occurrence.
A year ago, the Bruins reeled in the eighth best recruiting class nationally, according to Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com. Granted, USC was still atop the country at No. 1, but nonetheless, all signs appeared to indicate that UCLA was making deep inroads. There was, it seemed, progress.
After the Trojans’ sanctioning by the NCAA last summer prompted a wide variety of doom-and-gloom stories, there were a lot of people buying into the notion that the Southern California landscape was altering.
“The program is sanctioned and Pete Carroll’s in Seattle,” they said. “This is a perfect opportunity for UCLA.”
But as we’ve seen in recent months, that’s not quite right. What UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel accomplished recruiting-wise last February was more of a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence that won’t soon be replicated.
That’s not to say the Trojans’ crosstown rivals can’t recruit. But what we’ve learned is that stringing together highly-ranked recruiting classes in successive seasons is rare for most programs.
Which is what makes USC’s success this winter all the more remarkable.
As of Jan. 30, the Trojans rank fifth nationally on Rivals.com’s list of top 2011 classes, ahead of both BCS champion Auburn and national runner up Oregon, a feat that is certainly raising more than a few eyebrows on the national circuit.
Yet, in spite of sanctions, which technically limit USC to 15 scholarships in each of the next three seasons, Kiffin and his staff have trotted ahead and conducted business as usual, for a program accustomed to reeling in high-end talent on the gridiron.
And they can thank the appeal for that.
Because USC is in the midst of appealing its NCAA-levied sanctions, the penalties are delayed until the appeals committee renders a decision. As you can guess, a resolution made available prior to signing day Feb. 2 is highly unlikely, allowing the program to operate in a pre-probation climate.
Kiffin, consequently, will be able to sign a maximum of 25 scholarship players, in addition to the nine early enrollees, all of whom signed financial-aid agreements earlier this month allowing them to count against the program’s 2010 recruiting class.
In short, it’s conceivable that this coaching staff could sign 34 players in one class, which would be the highest total for the program in at least a decade. Currently, they have 26 commits.
Conversely, UCLA has followed its sub-.500 season in 2010 by soliciting a mere eight commitments thus far — a third of the Trojans’ tally. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times last week, athletic director Dan Guerrero remarked that it’s likely that the Bruins will sign just 15 or 16 players this offseason, insinuating that the small class is part of Neuheisel’s larger plan.
For perspective, sanctioned USC will offer at least 30 scholarships, while UCLA may offer roughly 15.
Some plan.
The Trojans, in many respects, have been able to exceed expectations recruiting-wise by solidifying their grip on the Southland, placing an emphasis on keeping the region’s top talent home.
So far, of USC’s 26 total commits, 23 hail from Arizona, Nevada and California, with 16 of those coming from Southern California. Quality, however, has not suffered.
Two of the country’s most talented skill players, Junipero Serra High School wide receiver George Farmer and Crenshaw High tailback/cornerback DeAnthony Thomas, grew up just a few highway exits south of the Coliseum and have given verbal commitments to play at USC.
Other Rivals100 USC commits include defensive end Greg Townsend Jr., quarterback Cody Kessler, quarterback Max Wittek and linebacker Tre Madden. And yes, all four grew up in Southern California.
But it is the 2011 class’s quantity that provides USC the opportunity to swiftly navigate past pending scholarship restrictions.
Kiffin has potentially constructed a foundation akin to Pete Carroll’s 2003 recruiting class, which included future all-Americans such as Reggie Bush, Lawrence Jackson and Ryan Kalil, and a grand total of 28 commits, who served as the building block of a modern-day football dynasty.
The size of the class alleviated pressure in the coming seasons, as Carroll offered just 19 scholarships in each of the two subsequent years.
By signing such a large class, sanctions aside, USC has afforded itself the opportunity to maintain its stranglehold on the region, much to the detriment of its rivals.
In August 2008, UCLA’s marketing department infamously printed a full-page ad in the Times, which read: “The football monopoly in Los Angeles is officially over.”
Those of us residing between the friendly confines of Adams and Exposition Boulevards are still waiting for that day. We’ve been waiting for some time.
“The 19th Hole” runs Mondays. To comment on this article e-mail Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
Correction: 1/26/11: A previous version of this story listed George Farmer’s high school as “Gardena Serra High.” The actual school’s name is Junipero Serra High School, located in Gardena. 
“‘The program is sanctioned and Pete Carroll’s in Seattle,’ they said. ‘This is a perfect opportunity for UCLA.'”

Mired in a fourth-set 11-11 deadlock, senior opposite Murphy Troy, renowned for his serve, approached the service line.
The USC men’s volleyball team would win the next nine points on the strength of Troy’s four aces — one of which even ricocheted off a defenseless Bruin player’s face.
Senior leadership · Senior opposite Murphy Troy had a match-high 26 kills that led the Trojans to victory over UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
The No. 1 Trojans (6-0, 6-0) extended scoring streak in the fourth set eradicated any chance for the No. 4 Bruins (7-3, 2-2) to mount a comeback, as the Trojans cruised to a 25-22, 23-25, 26-24, 25-16 victory.
Though Troy, the incumbent NCAA Player of the Week, amassed stratospheric numbers, he was not alone in his success.
USC coach Bill Ferguson attributed much of the victory to the adjustments his middle players made to their blocking scheme after the second set.
“Our middles did a great job of adjusting to their middle attack toward the end of the match,” Ferguson said. “Their middle blockers hit for pretty good numbers at first, but when it counted, I thought our guys made the stops and forced a couple of errors.”
In all, the Trojans out-blocked the Bruins 14.5 to 7.
USC’s three left side blockers — senior opposite hitter Tri Bourne, junior opposite hitter Tony Ciarelli and sophomore opposite hitter Maddison McKibbin — all played stout defense.
They limited junior setter Kyle Caldwell and junior opposite hitter Jack Polales to nightmarish -.042 and -.250 hitting percentages, respectively.
Statistics and analytics aside, perhaps the Trojans’ most impressive quality thus far has been their ability to quash all attempted comebacks, as they have yet to allow their opponents to engage them in a five-set match.
Ferguson drew a parallel between this match and the only other match this season in which the Trojans have ceded one set.
“What I’m most happy about is that we’re closing matches out,” Ferguson said. “Similar to the UC Irvine match, there were a couple of emotional sets in the second and third, but we came back to finish it before it got out of hand.”
Of course, one cannot neglect the additional satisfaction derived from trouncing a storied rival in the hallowed Pauley Pavilion.
USC fans, especially students, came in droves to this match to absorb this rivalry and naturally, to heckle a UCLA sports program that has struggled immensely this year against any team donning the cardinal and gold.
“It was a great atmosphere,” Ferguson said. “Our fans came in partway through the first set and made their presence known, countering the Bruins’ fans. The UCLA fans were great for them, and made it a real hostile environment. After the match, [the USC fans] stayed and cheered for us, chanting guys’ names individually. That was really cool.”
USC now enjoys a two-week hiatus during which the team’s strength and conditioning coaches will work to build up players’ stamina, ensuring the team is prepared for the extensive set of games ahead.
The Trojans will return to action against No. 8 Pepperdine Feb. 11.

In February 2009, three of the nation’s top prospects — guard Lamont Jones (Harlem, N.Y.) and forwards Solomon Hill (Los Angeles, Calif.) and Derrick Williams (La Mirada, Calif.), — had signed their letters of intent to play for USC under then-coach Tim Floyd.
Bench mob · Senior guard Donte Smith, pictured here against Stanford, provided a lift off the bench with 14 points, but the Trojans were outdone by Arizona’s big-three Saturday afternoon at McKale Center. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan 
An NCAA investigation and a coaching departure later, all three recruits had bolted for greener pastures in Tucson, Ariz., a move that finally came full circle Saturday night at the McKale Center.
Attempting to win their second-straight conference game for just the second time this season, the Trojans (12-10, 4-5) were victimized time and time again by their former recruits, as Arizona (18-4, 7-2) cruised to an easy 82-73 victory.
Williams, the front-runner to win the Pac-10 Player of the Year award, led Arizona in scoring with 20 points, despite playing with injured right pinkie finger. He was flawless from the field, hitting all six of his field goal attempts, including three from beyond the three-point arc.
While Williams served as an offensive catalyst in the second half, Jones was the primary difference-maker when the Wildcats made their game-changing run toward the latter part of the first half.
With nine minutes to go in the half, USC trailed 18-16, but two uncontested drives to the basket and a late three-point basket by Jones capped a 22-15 scoring spurt to end the half, and gave Arizona some much needed breathing room.
In the opening minutes of the second half, USC gave up an early 8-2 run and never saw the deficit drop below nine points the rest of the way.
Junior forward Nikola Vucevic led the Trojans in scoring for the second consecutive night, with 20 points and seven rebounds.
“I felt like we all played like women,” a visibly frustrated Vucevic told reporters after the game. “We didn’t play hard. Every single one of us just played like women.”
Senior guard Donte Smith also added 14 points off the bench, but his offensive spark went largely overlooked.
Although USC was able to cut the Wildcats’ lead to single digits in the final seconds, what they weren’t able to erase is more telling.
On top of the season-high 82 points the Trojans surrendered Saturday night, they also allowed Arizona to shoot a staggering 61 percent from the field, along with 35 bench points.
In addition, USC entered the McKale Center giving up an average of almost seven three-point baskets per game during its nine losses this season.
Against the Wildcats, the Trojans gave up 10 field goals from beyond the three-point line — six of which came during the team’s feeble comeback attempt in the second half.
“We beat Arizona State, and we thought we were a great team and could beat anybody,” Vucevic said. “It happens every time we get a big win. It’s got to stop.”
There will be little rest for the weary, as USC coach Kevin O’Neill’s squad travels across town Wednesday night to face the UCLA Bruins (14-7, 6-3) at 8 p.m.
The Trojans have already beaten the Bruins this season, winning 63-52 at the Galen Center Jan. 9.
O’Neill is currently undefeated against UCLA (3-0) in his two seasons at the helm of the Trojans’ bench. The team’s last loss against UCLA came during a 76-60 defeat at Pauley Pavilion in February 2009.
You need to stop harping on USC ex-recruits.  It was two years ago.  Get over it.
“I felt like we all played like women,” a visibly frustrated Vucevic told reporters after the game. “We didn’t play hard. Every single one of us just played like women.”
I’m glad he apologized. http://usc.ocregister.com/2011/01/30/vucevic-sorry-for-saying-usc-played-like-women/60126/
Such subliminal prejudices and stereotypes should not go unnoticed and uncorrected.
Solomon Hill NEVER signed a LOI with USC, get your facts straight, he commited to AZ then backed out when Olson retired, he then verbally committed to USC, but when Sean Miller was hired he switched back to Arizona.

After a 14-year break, John Robinson has returned.
USC announced Thursday the former football coach will work with the school’s athletic development staff, and take charge of athletic outreach in both San Diego and Orange County.
“We’re excited to have John back among the Trojan Family,” said USC athletic director Pat Haden in a statement. “He has always been a popular figure with our fans and we know he will be well received as he works with our donors in the Orange County and San Diego areas.”
Robinson started his career with the Trojans when he served as the football team’s offensive coordinator from 1972-1974. After spending one year on the Oakland Raiders’ coaching staff, he began his first stint as the USC head coach, which lasted from 1976-1982, and was highlighted by USC’s national championship in 1978.
He returned as USC’s coach in 1993 and held that position until 1997. During his tenure, he boasted a record of 104-35-4.
He won five Pac-10 conference titles and three Rose Bowls.
Robinson was also known for his success as the coach of the Los Angeles Rams from 1983-1991. He also coached at UNLV.
He recently worked as a color commentator for NFL games on the Sports USA Radio Network.
In 2009, Robinson was selected into the College Football Hall of Fame in his second year on the ballot.

Water bottles are so last season.
The next time you head to the gym, replace that H2O with a good old-fashioned glass of chocolate milk.
Yes, this is what doctors and athletes are saying these days: Chocolate milk is now the ultimate sports drink.
Chocolate milk may have just replaced water as the ultimate sports drink. | Daily Trojan
In recent years, chocolate milk has evolved from an elementary school student’s treat to a delicious and inexpensive replacement for overpriced Gatorades and various other fitness drinks.
Claims have been made that chocolate milk benefits the human body as much as, if not more than, routine energy formulas, flaunting an ideal combination of natural carbohydrates and proteins.
Since this discovery, even more studies have been conducted to determine just how beneficial chocolate milk can be for athletes.
According to a 2009 study in Medical News Today, chocolate milk was found to meet, and in some cases exceed, the post-workout recovery benefits of an equal-calorie sports drink.
A 2007 British study declared milk to be better at restoring fluid levels than water and other sports drinks after exercising under hot conditions.
With the appearance of these recent studies, it’s no wonder sports drink sales plummeted in 2009. Although most would attribute this downfall to economic hardships or other sales factors, the recent popularity of chocolate milk might have affected the downward trend.
Who wouldn’t choose cheap, delicious chocolate milk over a sports drink, anyway?
The benefits of chocolate milk are not necessarily new. Runners in particular have lauded the drink for years, praising it as a post-run miracle.
Only recently are other fields of fitness beginning to understand the benefits as well. Olympic gold-medalist Michael Phelps drank chocolate milk after swim sessions in the 2004 Olympics, helping to subtly promote the refreshment as a refueling wonder for sports other than just running or weight-lifting.
But why is chocolate milk so good for you? What exactly is it doing to garner such high praise from the athletic and medical communities?
Chocolate milk has a natural ratio of carbohydrates to proteins that is ideal for muscle recovery process after intense strength-training and aerobic exercises.
The amino acids found in chocolate milk also help to prevent future muscle damage and are capable of shortening recovery periods in between workouts. The acids repair damaged muscle tissue while promoting leaner muscle mass.
Additionally, chocolate milk, like plain milk, contains vitamin D and calcium levels that are significantly higher than those found in rival sports drinks. Such levels not only promote healthier muscles but also strengthen bones.
It is a more affordable beverage than sports drinks, too. If you’re not looking to buy a whole gallon of chocolate milk, simply  picking up a bottle of Hershey’s chocolate syrup is enough to keep you satisfied.
For the busy college student, chocolate milk is anything but inconvenient. Whether you’re chugging a glass at Everybody’s Kitchen or purchasing a small carton at Trojan Grounds, you’re bound to find chocolate milk for sale in just about any place you go.
If you’re worried about calorie content, chocolate milk shouldn’t be a problem. For something light, simply opt for skim milk.
If the creamier texture is tempting you after a hard workout, indulge in a glass of chocolate whole milk instead.
Either way, you’ll still be getting the same vitamins and proteins that are necessary for your muscles to properly recover.
But what about the lactose intolerant? Athletes can still reap the benefits by gulping down chocolate soy milk.
Though soy milk contains fewer proteins than regular milk, it is still an effective recovery drink with similar vitamins and minerals.
Aside from all the technical benefits of chocolate milk, what could be better than a sports drink that sounds like a dessert?
It might still hold the title of a sugary and unhealthy treat, but its well-documented benefits are proof enough that a glass or two shouldn’t leave you feeling guilty.
It’s important that all athletes understand the golden rule when exercising: Drinking something is vital in the first 30 minutes after exercising to repair any damaged or overstrained muscles.
And when it comes to choosing something both delicious and convenient, chocolate milk reigns supreme.

There is now a new chocolate milk that is even better for recovery. MojoMilk (www.mojomilk.com) is a powdered chocolate milk that is packaged into individual stick packs. It has 60% less calories than other chocolate milk and also has probiotics. In fact, MojoMilk delivers 10x the active cultures of yogurt, enhancing the immune system and supporting digestive health. Besides tasting great and delivering a great post workout benefit, MojoMilk is absolutely delicious.

The process of becoming a famous musician is a complex one, but the best way to learn is to hear it from someone who has been there.
On Friday, music executive Matthew Knowles, best known as the manager and father of pop sensations Beyoncé and Solange Knowles, and the founder, CEO and president of Music World Entertainment,  delivered a lecture to Thornton School of Music’s Popular Music Forum class.
True passion · During a talk with USC professor Christopher Sampson, Matthew Knowles stressed the importance of being involved in the music world simply for the love of the musical art, not for the money. - Emily Tat | Daily Trojan 
The talk was hosted at the Carson Sound Stage and Professor Christopher Sampson mediated the lecture, prompting Matthew Knowles with a number of questions that canvassed everything from his personal taste in music to the state of the modern music industry and his advice for the students in the class.
In the end, he stressed passion, preparedness, teamwork, thinking outside the box and not being afraid of failure as the cornerstones for successful musical artists.
As Matthew Knowles discussed his life before his initial involvement in the music industry, it was clear that he was a product of his own advice.
A graduate of Fisk University, Matthew Knowles spent many years working for Xerox, where he earned a six-figure salary.
But after Girl’s Tyme, the singing group Beyoncé was a part of, lost on Star Search, Matthew Knowles recognized the group’s ability to succeed and became more involved with it.
“For some reason, the ones that lose on Star Search rededicate, change their organization and they go on to be successful,” he said.
Girl’s Tyme was signed to Elektra Records, but was dropped before releasing an album.
What followed was a series of changes, including a lineup and the final name change to Destiny’s Child.
“That was the defining moment, when they were dropped by Elektra,” he said. “I quit my job and everyone thought I was nuts.”
Destiny’s Child signed to Columbia Records and went on to become an immensely popular group, selling more than 40 million records worldwide.
In addition to Destiny’s Child, Matthew Knowles was involved with the solo projects of the individual members as well as the career of his second daughter, Solange, who sings, acts, models and writes songs.
There were professional challenges, however that Matthew Knowles had to face. He was met with skepticism when he wanted to put a remix of the single “No, No, No” on the group’s self-titled debut.
But he argues how successful this would prove and it ultimately paid off, with the song staying at the top of the charts for weeks.
“You have to be a leader,” he said. “You have to think differently about your approach and people are going to say ‘that makes no sense whatsoever.’ People are going to laugh at your ideas, but that’s what it takes to be a visionary.”
When speaking about today’s music industry, Matthew Knowles noted how things have changed, and not always for the better.
“This business is declining,” Knowles said. “CD sales declined 19 percent from 2009 to 2010.”
In addition, digital sales are not the  success everyone believes them to be.
“We made less than a 1 percent increase, 0.6 percent, in digital single sales last year,” he said. “So we have to think of different ways to approach the music industry. We look at those six ways that artists can monetize: branding, endorsement, licensing, sponsorships, touring and songwriting.”
He stressed that CD sales bring in the smallest portion of income for artists today.
Matthew Knowles also said that it takes considerable time to make a significant amount of money in the industry.
“For new artists, there won’t be a monetary aspect,” he said. “It takes about seven years from the time you sign a contract for you to start making money in the music industry.”
But he added that for those who are truly passionate about music, money is not the primary concern.
“I’ve had failures and successes that I want to share with young people,” he said. “I’m very passionate about [the] music industry, and the thought was never ‘how much money am I going to make?’ It can never be for the money. It has to be because you love it.”
When questioned about the future of the music industry, Matthew Knowles asked students to stand up and identify themselves as what they were or aspired to be: singers, songwriters, musicians, producers, managers and so on.
“The answer is really the people in the room,” he said.
He argued that the rise of social networking has increased the number of possibilities for artists. Now, young artists don’t need managers to get noticed.
“You don’t have to be great to get started,” he said. “But you have to start to become great. Let that be your lesson as new artists, and just get started.”
Ultimately, Matthew Knowles gave the class an honest look into the music business and imparted advice from one music lover to a room full of them. He encouraged aspiring artists to take risks and make sure their passion reflects upon their work.
“You must be prepared to be great,” he said. “If you don’t believe it, nobody else is going to believe it.”

Are humans governed by their passions or by the gods? Is life a case of fate or free will?
These are the questions that Gods and Marionettes asked of its audience.
Organized by USC Spectrum, the show was a collaboration between the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Company and the capella troupe, SONOS.
Anna Wierzbowska| Daily Trojan
Ushered in by haunting choral sounds, Gods and Marionettes began by putting an odd twist on actor Donald Webber, Jr.’s introduction.
With a casual tone and no regard for the fourth wall, Webber pulled the audience members into the act by asking them to raise their hands into the air, as if pulled by strings.
With the audience now bound to the show’s central concept, Webber backed away as the two troupes took the stage.
The show was satisfyingly immersive, with dancers and singers meshing together, complimented by the brilliant lighting. It was a sensory experience in which the conjunction of set pieces — each brilliant alone — elevated the performance to a higher aesthetic.
Gods and Marionettes was inspired by Greek tragedies, and although there were some references to the Oracle and other figures within the performance, it did not take any oblique cues from those stories.
Instead, the show borrowed some of the broader themes and emotions from the genre, most notably sorrow and guilt, and looked at the motivations behind the actions of mankind.
The dancers commanded the foreground of the Bovard stage. Dressed in neutral fabrics, the dancers alternated between primal and sophisticated movements. When the vocals were silent and a beat overtook the stage, the company used sharp, reactionary movements.
Later, when SONOS opened into choral renditions — both original songs and new arrangements of modern music — the erratic actions turned into flowing twists and turns.
The dancing and singing coalesced, but for most of the show, the two troupes stayed separate, with SONOS’ vocals adding an ethereal atmosphere from the back of the stage.
But during a rendition of Depeche Mode’s “Blasphemous Rumours,” singer Paul Peglar joined one dancer for an incredibly intimate performance duet. The rest of the cast stepped back and let the two be the center of attention.
It was a standout sequence and a great twist on the grand collaborations between the two groups that made up most of the night.
The lighting was especially impressive. Instead of flashing colors or rapid strobe effects, it was subdued in its changes.
The golden light worked well with the neutral costumes of the dancers, while the subdued dark colors in the background gave SONOS haunting silhouettes.
What was most surprising about the show was Webber himself. At the performance’s start, he was the odd one out, a modern man spouting contemporary dialogue that mixed philosophy and humor. He was charming and entertaining, but as the show progressed, he felt anachronistic with his modern speech and wardrobe.
Thankfully, in the later stages of Gods and Marionettes, Webber fared well. His humor gave way to introspection and contemplation, and the bespectacled figure emerged as a commanding presence.
This transformation came to a head at the show’s climax, which brought the meditative performance into a more intense stage. The neutral colors shifted to passionate reds and oranges, and Webber took over lead vocals as SONOS backed him in a surprisingly intense and philosophic rendition of Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit.” It was an unexpected yet fitting finale.
Gods and Marionettes was more nuanced and complex than both interpretive dance and traditional a capella singing are on their own.
By merging the two mediums together and weaving in Bridel’s words, the performance elevated itself into a philosophic meditation on the drivers of life.
Gods and Marionettes does not offer an answer to its central question, but it does forces its audience to consider its complex questions about fate and free will.

Anyone interested in meeting E.T.?
Randolph Hall, vice president of research at USC, announced Tuesday that USC has partnered with the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute in Mountain View, Calif.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojan
According to a faculty memo, this affiliation will “enable joint research projects by USC and SETI Institute Scientists, and student internships for USC students.”
This provides incredible new opportunities for USC undergraduates to compete for NASA funding in the field of astrobiology. They might also be able to contribute to Johannes Kepler’s search for inhabitable planets.
Coupled with the recent creation of a committee to expand the neuroscience program, USC continues to advance its reputation as a vanguard research university.
Now if only more undergraduates could utilize the resources available to them.
There is certainly no shortage of university funding and support. Between the USC Provost’s Undergraduate Research Fellowships, the Undergraduate Research Associates Program and Women in Science and Engineering, various major-specific opportunities lie within each school.
As a private research university, USC attracts students that want to apply their skills in labs and classrooms. In fact, students want to start as early and squeeze in as much relevant, hands-on experience as they can.
If both the university and its students desire an increase in undergraduate research, then why is there a disconnect?
Quite simply, students remain daunted by the prospect of taking the initiative. They might not know how to find a laboratory, approach professors with interesting publications or initiate the mentor-student relationship.
And to that end, USC cannot merely continue its well-intentioned yet ineffective attempts at publicizing its platter of research funding opportunities when students remain at a loss for how to create a proposal to begin with.
Currently,  few majors have required 490x (Directed Research) classes for their undergraduate degrees, even though almost every department from linguistics to architecture to business  offers two-unit 490x classes.
More, if not all, majors at USC should implement a research requirement of at least four units, ensuring a full year of research on a long-term project, but capped at eight units to allow for other areas of study.
As a freshman last semester, I took Introduction to Research Apprenticeship in a molecular biology laboratory that works with the genetics of aging.
The experience not only jumpstarted my interest in research, but also allowed me to learn complex technical skills and to think independently about solving a problem by applying textbook theory.
Through research, I have learned to not be discouraged by setbacks but to re-engage the problem with a different approach or new perspective.
I have only heard similar sentiments among others in the program,  best exemplified at the end-of-semester symposium where students enthusiastically present their research findings. Some of my fellow students even claimed to have finally found their passions.
Faculty-directed undergraduate research allows students to gain hands-on experience with innovation  and to find real-world applications of rote textbook material.
According to a report by the Education Commission of the States, Making Quality Count, undergraduate research ranked as the most effective method for “active learning,” “integrating education and experience” and “ongoing practice of learned skills.”
The study also rated undergraduate research as the best for “out-of-class contact with faculty.”
Developing a mentor relationship with a faculty member will not only guide students through their undergraduate years at USC, but could help clarify career paths and realize the personal demands of their professions of interest.
And, of course, experience with research as an undergraduate provides students a competitive advantage when they apply to graduate schools.
As students advance through a research program, their projects become more difficult, so it becomes much easier to transition from upper-level to graduate student-level research.
After all, someone has to create the next nanotechnology circuitry or synthetic organism. Why not a USC student?

If I could describe USC in one phrase, I would called it “The Social Network,” and I would compare it to a live and more distinguished Facebook.
Networking is so ingrained into our school’s culture that to succeed at USC it is imperative that you establish the skills and courage to network.
Whether you see it or not, the people who thrive at USC are the ones who have subconsciously or consciously mastered the skills necessary to network. Unfortunately, not all students recognize this and consequently many have trouble finding their niche at USC.
Cultivating the skills crucial to networking helps to create a more fulfilling student experience at USC.
Whether it is with professors, professionals, friends, or peers, students need to learn the most effective ways to connect with people.
When first arriving at USC, I was overwhelmed by the diversity of my peers. I wasn’t sure where I would fit in and was almost set on transferring after my first few months in school.
As I worked to adopt a less pessimistic perspective, I was able to improve my social skills. From that point on, my college experience has improved and I’ve surpassed my beginning-of-college “mid-life crisis.”
For those who find themselves in a situation similar to the one I was in, a good idea would be to put into perspective the views and ideas of those around you and to learn more about them. By fulfilling the role of an active listener, we can learn to be more conversational with our peers and better articulate our own interests.
Embrace this newfound knowledge and put it to work in places such as career fairs, alumni events and the many other opportunities provided at USC.
Browse through the abundance of organizations that USC offers and attend some meetings. Even if you do not like the club or organization after the first meeting, then the worst-case scenario is that you met people who you might interact with on future occasions.
With upcoming career fairs and other networking events hosted at all USC schools, students should feed off the university’s ability to attract the top talent from around the world.
Fellow Trojans hold some of the most powerful positions in the region — in business, entertainment,and politics. More importantly, the university brings them back to their alma mater to recruit the next generation of leaders.
The Trojan family does its part to reach out to students. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be doing our part to reach out, too. And it’s never too early to start.
Chelsea Beirne is a freshman majoring in English and political science.
That is exactly how I felt my freshman year. And that’s exactly what I learned in the following three years. Now I’m a senior and that networking was priceless. 
This is a great article.

In an interview with MTV this past July, he mentioned being inspired by some reggae songs during a trip to Jamaica with his family. “I’d never heard any of these songs but could imagine them having an everlasting imprint, like people would dance to this stuff forever. I could feel these songs really meant something. Not just in Jamaica but globally, crossing through culture and language,” he said.
This began the creation of Black Cards.
The only aspect of Black Cards that is similar to Fall Out Boy is Pete Wentz. Other than that, their music is completely different, with a dub and reggae vibe. Their female lead singer, Bebe Rexha from New York, also brings a nice change to the stage. Rexha’s voice adds a Gwen Stefani-esque power to the band, taking listeners back to the days of No Doubt.
This spring, Black Cards will be joining Decaydance label mate, Travie McCoy, on his Sgt. Schlepper’s Who Needs Hearts Club Band Tour, along with Donnis, XV and Bad Rabbits. Pre-sale for VIP bundles are officially over, but general admission tickets are now on sale.
Before you go out and buy your ticket, check out their songs “Club Called Heaven,” Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Fame” and their newest release “Dominoes” on their Myspace.

The 911 call was placed shortly after 6:30 a.m., and at 7 a.m. paramedics arrived at Sheen’s Beverly Hills mansion, where he was seen wheeled out of his house on a stretcher with a towel partially covering his face, TMZ reports. Sheen was joined in the Cedar-Sinai emergency room by his parents, Martin Sheen and Jane Templeton and ex-wife Denise Richards.

An undisclosed source told TMZ Thursday morning that Sheen’s condition was “serious,” however, test results concluded that the intense stomach pains were caused by a hiatal hernia — which is easily treatable. He was treated for his symptoms and released from the hospital Thursday night, according to the LA Times via The Insider.
Sheen has been notorious for his tabloid fodder for months now, his most wild stint occurring last October, when the trouble actor threw a raging, cocaine-fueled fit in a New York City restaurant then subsequently trashed his hotel room, witnessed by his high-priced escort for the evening.
Sheen’s hospitalization Thursday also followed a night of heavy partying that allegedly included the company of several adult film stars. TMZ reports that 22-year-old Kacey Jordan was invited to Sheen’s home to “party” on Tuesday night, but left Wednesday afternoon. The party apparently continued, as neighbors told TMZ they heard music and “women singing” from Wednesday night to early morning Thursday. Two women were also reportedly seen leaving Sheen’s residence as the paramedics arrived.
There have also been reports of heavy cocaine use throughout the 36-hour binge, however, The Hollywood Reporter states Sheen has denied drug use.
Since Two and a Half Men is currently on a scheduled hiatus this week, the show’s production has not been immediately affected. Today, publicist Stan Rosenfield announced that Sheen will return to set on Tuesday when the sitcom’s hiatus ends.
Although Sheen’s uninhibited debauchery has taken a toll on both the actor’s health and reputation, it seems to never cause a riff in his professional life. According to The Hollywood Reporter, studio execs have been waiting for a reason to get Sheen to seek professional help and possibly shut down Two and a Half Men so the actor can enter rehab. But a source told THR that despite his shameless drug-and-alcohol abuse, Sheen has continually “showed up and done his job. Everyone likes him. He’s professional.”

Ross and Walker had already moved on by forming The Young Veins and released their album, Take A Vacation!, in 2010. The only thing Urie and Smith released was one song, “New Perspective,” on the Jennifer’s Body soundtrack.
Panic! finally came out of the shadows completely on Jan. 18 by announcing Mar. 29 as their release date for Vices & Virtues. Although their first single, “The Ballad of Mona Lisa,” can be found on various blogs and a lyric video was created, the official release date is Feb. 1.
After their Beatles-que album, Pretty. Odd., the new album Vices should receive nods of approval by fans who missed the upbeat feel of their first album, A Fever You Can’t Sweat Out. “The Ballad of Mona Lisa” is a great sneak peek of the diverse styles and instruments that will exist throughout Vices.
The sound of a tinkering music box piano in the new single is a taste of the theatrical theme that existed in A Fever. The rest of the album may dabble back into the realm of using an abundance of instruments, including a little bit of synthesizer, while still having a freshness of straightforward alternative rock.

According to the Los Angeles Times’ Hero Complex blog, director Zack Snyder of 300, has tapped TV actor Henry Cavill to play Clark Kent in the upcoming Superman reboot.

Cavill is no stranger to tights – he is most recognized as King Henry’s handsome right hand man Charles Brandon in the Showtime period drama The Tudors. The British-born actor will play America’s ultimate superhero after reportedly auditioning for both reboots of James Bond and Batman and losing the roles to Daniel Craig and Christian Bale, according to Hollywood industry blog Deadline Hollywood.
Though the franchise’s last entry into theaters was a mere five years ago and opened to tepid box office success, Warner Brothers has announced a full investment into this new film, which will be written by David S. Goyer, who wrote Batman Begins and will have Inception’s power producers, Christopher Nolan and Emma Thompson.
Cavill will join the likes of Christopher Reeve, Dean Cain, Tom Welling and Brandon Routh in the pantheon of actors that have played Kal-El. No announcements have been made as to the potential villains this Man of Steel will face.
Superman: Man of Steel is slated for release in December 2012.
