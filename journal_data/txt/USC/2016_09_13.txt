 
USC was ranked 23rd in the 2017 U.S. News & World Report’s list of “Best Colleges” released Tuesday, improving from a tie for 23rd last year.
This places USC a spot above rival UCLA, which is tied for 24th along with Carnegie Mellon University.
This year’s report ranks the schools through data provided by universities, as well as information from a number of sources, such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics and the Council for Aid to Education.
After holding 23rd place in 2014, USC dropped to 25th place the next year. It rose back to 23rd place for the 2016 and 2017 rankings. Conversely, UCLA has dropped from 23rd place in 2014 to 24th place in 2017.
The data collected includes graduation and retention rates, undergraduate academic reputation, student selectivity, financial resources, graduation rate performance and alumni giving rate. The combination of these seven indicators allows the U.S. News & World Report to rank universities, although a statement released by UCLA in LA Weekly on Monday suggested that too much weight is placed on the last factor.
“The U.S. News methodology emphasizes factors that tend to favor private universities, such as endowment size, rate of alumni giving and student–faculty ratio,” the statement said.
According to the U.S. News and World Report, however, alumni giving rates only make up 5 percent of the composite weighted score.
“The host of intangibles that makes up the college experience can’t be measured by a series of data points,” the organization’s website states. “But for families concerned with finding the best academic value for their money, the U.S. News Best Colleges rankings provide an excellent starting point for the search. The formula uses quantitative measures that education experts have proposed as reliable indicators of academic quality, and it’s based on U.S. News’ researched view of what matters in education.”

Sen. Sabrina Enriquez proposed adding referendums to allow the student body to vote on student policies at the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting on Tuesday. The Senate also voted to change its bylaws and the election code, and discussed USG staff appointments.
Jessica Zhou | Daily TrojanElectoral college · Katherine Lee, the USG Director of Elections, talked about the elections code and bylaws at Tuesday’s meeting.
As proposed by Enriquez, the process for passing a referendum would start with proposing a change to the associate director of elections. USG’s judicial council would then vote to determine the proposal’s constitutionality, after which the issue would be opened up to a University-wide vote. If the proposal gains the support of at least one-tenth of the undergraduate student body, the Senate would need to reach a two-thirds majority. If a referendum aims to amend the Student Senate Constitution, it must be passed by a majority of students.
“Referendums can address major issues if the entire student body is on board with it. I think it’s really important that we have it in our bylaws,” Enriquez said. “I think it’s actually a shame that our bylaws don’t allow the entire student body to make change within this University, and frankly just about every other university has it.”
In response to Sen. Daniel Newman, who questioned if there was any mechanism to force the administration to listen to the results of the referendum, USG Vice President Austin Dunn said that the administration would not be doing their jobs if they ignored the opinion of the united student body.
The Senate also voted on the changes to the elections code and bylaws proposed in last week’s Senate meeting. The bylaw changes, which passed, included changing the title of “associate director of elections and recruitment” to “director of elections,” as well as other cosmetic changes.
Regarding the changes to the elections code, the proposed “nine strikes” rule to disqualify any candidate who commits nine elections code violations was voted on separately from the other changes. The other changes included clarifying that candidates for Senate could not run in conjunction with presidential candidates and removing the necessity for Senators to represent and reside in specific constituencies. The Senate voted to approve the other changes.
Sen. Tiffany Lian raised concerns that the nine-strikes policy would allow too many violations of the elections code before disqualifying a candidate, and said that she would prefer to keep the current system of major and minor strikes. Sen. Emily Lee concurred, also saying that having the elections commission impose strikes might be too subjective.
Lian and Sen. Tyler Matheson discussed making amendments to the strike system, but did not have time to draft their proposals during the meeting.
Katherine Lee, the director of elections, said that she had communicated with the chief justice of the judicial branch, who said that he would be willing to help interview elections commission candidates to ensure impartiality.
However, several Senators pointed out that there was no formal commitment made, and tabled the proposed nine-strikes policy until next week to allow time for the chief justice to respond.
The directors of various USG branches also presented their proposed hires for still-vacant staff positions. Only one position, commuter liaison, remains vacant. Regarding the appointment for Greek liaison, who is from a Greek house overseen by the Pan-Hellenic Council, Enriquez suggested exploring whether multicultural Greek councils could become more involved.
Enriquez also proposed extending applications, given that the commuter liaison position is still vacant, but the other Senators agreed that the staff should be able to start working as soon as possible. The appointments will be voted on next week.

In the Palestinian-Israeli dispute, 43 percent of U.S. millennials side with Israel, the lowest the figure has ever been, and 27 percent sympathize with Palestine, which is the highest share of any generation. Campus movements across the nation have gathered around the Palestinian cause. At USC, there exists a branch of the national group Students for Justice in Palestine. 

Last Thursday, SJP hosted “Palestine 101,” an event dedicated to informing students about the history of Palestine and the pro-Palestinian movement taking place today. The event was made “for students by students,” according to its coordinators, and around 35 students attend the lecture by Professor Fayez Hammad of the School of International Relations and department of political science. Hammad stated during the lecture that the “Arab-Israeli conflict has become a Palestinian-Israeli conflict again.”
“This event is an annual thing for SJP and across campuses and across universities,” said the USC SJP President, who wished to remain anonymous to protect herself from retaliation by anti-Palestinian groups online. “Its aim is to raise awareness about the conflict from a Palestinian perspective and one which really shines light on the struggle of the Palestinian people and the geopolitical complexities that have given rise to this occupation.”
According to the student organization’s president, support for the pro-Palestine movement is growing on college campuses in general, which she attributes to organizations like SJP and Jewish Voices for Peace, but at USC, the movement tends to fluctuate with student activity.
“At USC, the history of SJP is not a trajectory upwards, it’s more up and down, with moments where it’s super active and moments where it’s kind of been a little more quiet but I do see this as an extremely pivotal point for USC SJP,” the president said.
The president added that she approaches the movement from an academic, reading-based point of view and hopes that her colleagues do the same. She hopes to create an environment where students feel free to voice their questions.
“I want to bring that to SJP, where people are not afraid to ask questions, where we’re assured of our stance, which is pro-Palestine,” the president said. “But at the same time, we can engage everyone who has doubts maybe around that and I really want to make sure that it is an inviting and open environment for that.”
Yet, according to the 2015-2016 Israel on Campus Coalition Campus Trends Report, there was a 12 percent decrease in anti-Israel activity on U.S. college campuses from last year. Additionally, pro-Israel activity increased by 3.5 percent from last year.
However, the SJP president also said that it is difficult to engage with the topic at USC, as it can be extremely polarizing and students are often scared to approach it.
“I’m not exactly hoping to bridge that gap because I’m not sure how to do that,” she said. “I just really hope people are able to move away from the myths and the biases involved and really understand that this is one of the ongoing struggles of our generation.”
Morgan Mamon, a senior majoring in Middle East studies, who is also an active member of SJP, echoed a similar sentiment, adding it is also an understudied topic in the Middle East classes at USC due to its polarizing nature. After Mamon traveled through Palestine and Israel while studying abroad, she realized the scope of the conflict and saw her academic understanding lacking.
“To me, it seems that a lot of students at USC are even less educated on the topic, which is why ‘Palestine 101’ is something I’ve been very adamant about taking place this semester,” Mamon said.
Mamon added that she wanted the event to be a success because if more students at USC were informed on the topic, more discussion on campus could take place.
“If just a broader population at USC can be informed on the topic we could have much more fruitful discussions in the end about a conflict that is so controversial and so polarizing,” Mamon said. “It’s disappointing to me to see the fact that people are so unwilling to talk about it.”
Mamon said that because the political climate of the United States tends to lean more pro-Israel, she is glad that the pro-Palestinian movement is growing on college campuses because it’s a move towards balancing out the conversation. She added that she is hoping that this will lead to more engaging discussions on the issue when taking place from a variety of perspectives.
“The thing that’s saddest about this conversation in the U.S. is how polarizing it is and how incapable we are of having a real discussion,” Mamon said. “There’s so much detail and history to this place and for us to just pick a side. That is the biggest problem to this conversation in the U.S.”
SC Students for Israel co-President Rachel Quinn said in an email to the Daily Trojan that they agreed the pro-Palestinian movement is growing on college campuses. They also believe creating dialogue between the two groups is the key to bridging the gap.
“Differing viewpoints are not so uncommon, but nothing will be solved by either side of the conflict being shut off to learning about the other side’s views and beliefs,” Quinn wrote. “Education is also very important in beginning to end the conflict — by creating a multi-cultural dialogue (one of the main things we promote through SCSI), we can become more open to opposing views and work together for a solution we both want.”
SCSI’s other co-President Shayna Lewis wrote that along with engaging in meaningful dialogue, the purpose of SCSI is to bring awareness and appreciation of the Israeli culture. This week Hillel, a Jewish organization on campus, is sponsoring “Israel Week” on campus, a weeklong event promoting Birthright, which is a cost-free, 10-day trip to Israel offered to all Jewish young adults, according to their website.
“We want to expose students to Israeli culture, through various speakers, workshops and educational seminars,” Lewis wrote. “We partner with other organizations on a regular basis that offer us resources and help us promote dialogue on campus.”
Lewis added that she also believes the conflict can be very polarizing for this generation, writing that often it forces people to take a side even though many of them may not have had any first-hand experience with the situation in the Middle East.
“However, being associated with either side of the conflict creates the necessity to present an opinion, no matter what that opinion may be,” Lewis wrote. “This association may come from an individual identification with one side or another, but it can also result from societal expectations of where a person seems to fit into the wide range of personnel associated with the conflict.”
 
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Professor Fayez Hammad spoke “…about the Middle Eastern conflict in the context of today and its conception in 1948 when the state of Israel was established.” He did not discuss these topics. 
I think we should help Abbas and his dear friends and allies Hamas create a Palestinian state. Since Hamas is more popular than Abbas let’s call it Hamasistan. It could be based on all the other Islamist states. Women would have zero rights. Gays would be hung. Jews would be verboten. Non-Muslims would be killed unless they convert to Islam or pay a crippling tax that is designed just for infidels (non-Muslims). 
I think this makes a lot of sense and is something college punks should march for, shout about, and pretend they care about. The world needs another Islamist state. What will we do without another Islamist state?  It could join with Syria and then fight for fighting’s sake.  
In Hamasistan criminals will be punished by being tied to the back of jeeps and skinned to death. The lucky criminals will simply be pushed off rooftops, and if they’re really lucky the rooftop will be very high.
In Hamasistan they will blame all their problems on Israel’s history, colonialism and imperialism that way the Hamas politicians can line their Swiss Vaults with endless international aid money and not be held accountable.  I mean we all know Arafat died with hundreds of millions in international inside his cavernous Swiss vaults.
Yes, this will solve all the problems and just ask any leftist, liberal, dreaming moron whether it will and he/she will tell you without a moment’s hesitation that this is so.  Leave it up to the left to hate that which is good and to embrace that which envelopes darkness.

For anyone looking for some interesting reading material on the five-hour drive up for the Weekender, the Stanford Daily has published quite the football story. Though Trojan die-hards would have to swallow their pride a little bit to get through it, it nonetheless provides some great context on the rivalry before going into this weekend’s big game, and is a very detailed roadmap for the Trojans going forward.
Nick Entin | Daily TrojanRags to roses · First year head coach Clay Helton finds himself looking to restore glory to a once-prominent USC football program.
Titled “Rags to Roses,” and written by a trio of sportswriters for the Stanford Daily in 2013, the book chronicles the meteoric rise of Stanford’s football program from almost a complete afterthought in 2006 to a Rose Bowl championship and perennial spot on top of the conference standings.
Prior to 2006, Stanford really did not have that rich of a history in football. Since World War II, the Cardinal had won only three Rose Bowls — in 1940 and consecutively in 1970 and 1971, with losing appearances in 1951 and 1999. With the exception of quarterback John Elway, Stanford never really produced any noteworthy NFL players. Even while Elway was there, the team’s most memorable accomplishment was being on the losing end of the most bizarre play — The Play — in college football history against Cal during a 5-6 campaign in 1982.
The school had a rich athletic history outside of football. It’s one of the few schools that has near the same number of Olympic athletes or medals as USC. It has more than 100 NCAA national championships across all sports — up there with USC and UCLA for the most all time — but Stanford spent the first half of the past decade as not just bad at football, but really bad.
From 2002 to 2006, the Trojans won their five games against Stanford by a combined 130 points, bookended by a 49-17 blowout in 2002 and a 42-0 shutout in 2006. The Cardinal finished that 2006 season 1-11, an almost unfathomably awful number for a team that is ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll ten seasons later.
The transformation occurred when Stanford hired Jim Harbaugh for the start of the 2007 season. In his first year, the Cardinal pulled off its monumental, program-changing upset at the Coliseum, which we would all like to forget that launched Stanford back into national prominence. Since then, the Cardinal were crowned Pac-12 champions three times and won three Rose Bowls.
The importance of a coach like Harbaugh for the program cannot be overstated, nor can how unprecedented his own personal rise is. He had a reasonably long professional playing career, cracking an NFL roster for 14 seasons, but he had no prominent coaching experience before he took over Stanford — he was an assistant at Western Kentucky, briefly with the Oakland Raiders and his only head coaching gig was at the University of San Diego.
As much as they might not get along after an extended rivalry, Harbaugh is very similar to Pete Carroll in the sense that no one really would have expected either to have risen so high or so quickly in the college game. Yet both personalities were so instrumental, arguably indispensable, in their respective program surges. Harbaugh’s success is arguably even more impressive, because he had much less history and tradition to build off of, and was almost starting from scratch with a 1-11 team.
With that being said, the rise of Stanford is still missing a truly happy ending. Though the Pac-12 has grown as one of the more competitive conferences in all of football, USC is still the only team to have won an actual national championship in the BCS era. Neither Oregon nor Stanford, despite their ability to win conference championships and Rose Bowls, have been able to claim to ultimate prize in college football just yet.
The struggles of USC football have not quite reached the depths of a one-win season since the team’s last Rose Bowl win in the 2008 season. But this is now the eighth season since that Rose Bowl win, and the seventh since Carroll’s departure. What would qualify as a rough patch or a dry spell for USC football hasn’t even included a season below .500, and did include the milestone of the program making it to its first Pac-12 championship game last year. But the Trojans certainly have not reclaimed their spot on top of the conference since then, a spot that felt like a rite of passage at one point for seven straight seasons.
So the rise of USC football back to the level of winning a Rose Bowl would not be quite as interesting of a story, but it will be equally as challenging. As the Cardinal proved last year, USC will likely have to go through a very strong, very consistent Stanford program to do so.
The good news is that USC is not that far behind. Again, the same program that metaphorically hit rock bottom with the midseason dismissal and ensuing lawsuit of its head coach last year still represented its division in the conference championship game. Last year’s 41-22 defeat in the Pac-12 title game certainly was not pretty, but the Trojans proved over the course of the season that they belonged to be there.
The other good news is that if USC wants to overtake Stanford, its current program leader very much resembles the Stanford ethos. Clay Helton does not have the same big name, big game personality of a Carroll or a Harbaugh, but he very much resembles Stanford’s current head coach David Shaw, embodying a humble, disciplined work ethic.
This weekend represents another very big, very challenging test for a young team and a rookie coach. But the Trojans have proven in recent years that they can go up to Stanford as underdogs and come away with a win, doing just that the last time they were in Palo Alto in 2014. More importantly, though, the Trojans just need to have a game that gives them confidence going into the rest of the conference slate — read: not lose 52-6. The Trojans need to set the tone that they would be ready for a rematch in December.
Luke Holthouse is a senior majoring in policy, planning and development and print and digital journalism. His column, “Holthouse Party,” runs on Wednesday.
Actually Stanford has produced several noteworthy NFL players, besides Elway, prior to their current “resurgence.”
Jim Plunkett (2 Super Bowl wins as QB), James Lofton (NFL HOF receiver) and John Lynch (perennial all-pro safety for Tampa Bay and Denver) come immediately to mind.

As practice wound down on Tuesday, energy and spirits were high. The offense ran a series of plays against the second-string defense, shouts of encouragement erupting from the sidelines as a corner broke up a pass in the end zone.
Brian Chin | Daily TrojanThe Stanford standard · Senior tailback Justin Davis and the Trojans suffered two losses to the Cardinal last season including a 41-22 blowout in the Pac-12 Championship game in December.
In the final play of practice, freshman wide receiver Cary Angeline roped in a pass and wove in between two defenders, trotting into the endzone. He was quickly followed by junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and true freshman wide receiver Daniel Imatorbhebhe, who chased down the field after him, cheering loudly. Smith-Schuster and Angeline leapt into the air, bouncing off each other and smacking helmets as they jogged to the huddle shoulder-to-shoulder.
It was the type of practice that left the whole team buzzing with excitement as they left the field for the locker room. Both coaches and players praised the performance of the offense and the defense for creating an aggressive, competitive atmosphere throughout practice.
“That’s kind of the stuff we need for everybody to get better to face any team like Stanford,” said senior tailback Justin Davis. “The better we can simulate what Stanford’s gonna give us, the better we’re going to do in the game.”
Similar rounds of full-out play throughout the rest of the week will be necessary for the team as they head into Saturday’s match-up against Stanford. After two losses against the Cardinal last season — punctuated by a 22-41 rout in the Pac-12 Championship game — the Trojans will need to prepare to grind out a physical game this weekend.
The Christian McCaffrey effect
The knock-out punch for USC the last time they faced Stanford was junior running back and punt returner Christian McCaffrey. The running back tallied 464 yards against the Trojans, slicing apart the defense and spearheading a third-quarter surge that led to the Trojans’ eventual loss.
It was considered a snub when McCaffrey, as a sophomore,  didn’t receive the Heisman for his 3,864 all-purpose yard season. This year, he returns with a chip on his shoulder and a set of wide receivers who can open the field for the run game. Switching back and forth from running back to slot receiver and even wide-out, McCaffrey will clearly be a problem for the defense for all four quarters.
“He’s all over the place,” said head coach Clay Helton. “So it’s kind of like finding Waldo. You have to be able to locate him.”
Although McCaffrey will put constant pressure on the offense, his presence also creates pressure for the Trojan running backs to produce similar yards and scoring opportunities. Davis said that playing against a hyped running back like McCaffrey only gives himself and his teammates a competitive edge to prove themselves.
“That drives us to do better,” Davis said. “With all the success he has, that makes us want to work hard to get our names out there. We’ve got backs just as talented at USC and we want to show that.”
Health concerns
There were a handful of players missing or sitting out for parts of practice on Tuesday. Missing from practice was senior offensive tackle Zach Banner, who took a day off of practice due to the stomach flu. He is expected to return to practice on Wednesday after taking Tuesday to rest.
“Nothing to be worried about,” junior offensive lineman Damien Mama said. “He commented on my Instagram post, so he should be fine.”
Sophomore defensive back Marvell Tell III practiced with the team but didn’t participate in any contact drills after suffering a head collision against Utah State on Saturday. He will meet with a doctor one more time before being cleared for contact play.
After suffering a collision that injured both his ribs and his thigh, sophomore tailback Ronald Jones II also sat out for parts of practice. Although his ribs are feeling better, Helton said that the thigh contusions suffered in the first quarter of the Utah State game are taking longer to heal than expected. Helton is hopeful that Jones will be recover quickly enough to return in full health, especially on the heels of his explosive performance against Stanford in the Pac-12 Championship last year.
“We’d really like a healthy [Jones],” Helton said. “That really helps you anytime. That speed is always something we want. I’m really looking forward to getting him back.”

As the No. 2-ranked men’s golf team gets ready to tee off its 2016-17 campaign this weekend in Chicago, the hype behind this year’s squad is palpable. After losing 4-1 in match play to Texas during the semifinals of last spring’s NCAA Championships, the roster has undergone almost no rebuilding. Instead it has reloaded, bringing back all five starters from last year’s team while adding two top-flight freshmen, most notably Cheng Jin, from Beijing, who competed at the 2016 Masters. This Saturday, the team begins its quest to capture their first-ever NCAA Championship in one of the team’s most anticipated seasons in school history.
Photo courtesy of Sports InformationTrojan tee time · Senior Rico Hoey led the Trojans with a 70.85 stroke average last year and won the the SCGA Amateur in July.
In effect, head coach Chris Zambri, who enters his 11th year at the helm, has assembled a dream team of amateur talent. Junior Jonah Texeira comes into the season fresh off of a semifinal appearance in the 2016 U.S. Amateur tournament in August. His teammate, junior Sean Crocker, accomplished the same feat a year ago at the 2015 U.S. Amateur, the summer after being named Pac-12 Freshman of the Year. Redshirt senior Andrew Levitt and senior Rico Hoey, both offer immense experience and all-conference quality play. Hoey, who averaged the second-best 70.86 stroke average on the team in 2015, even captured the SCGA Amateur earlier in July. Also back are two battle tested sophomores in Justin Suh and Ryan Slater. As freshmen, they combined for 59 rounds, showing that Zambri is not afraid to throw inexperienced, young players into the fire. Suh even qualified for the US Open this summer, narrowly missing the cut by two strokes.
“We are starting the season off this week with a team that I feel can go all the way this year,” Hoey said. “We have prepared for this year the same way we did last year, which is just pushing one another to get better and better. I am excited to get it started.”
This weekend’s stroke play tournament, the OFCC/Fighting Illini Invitational at Olympia Fields, will offer the Trojans a very stiff early challenge. Featured in the field are the No. 1-ranked Texas Longhorns, who return four starters from the team that prematurely ended the Trojans’ season at the NCAA championship in the spring. Hosting the tournament is No. 3 University of Illinois, which has three current players who qualified for the U.S. Amateur. The Trojans will be able to test themselves against elite level competition right away and see if they can live up to their lofty expectations.
The most compelling aspect of the impending men’s golf season is whether or not coach Chris Zambri will tamper with an already near perfect lineup. Jin possesses future superstar ability. The 18-year-old player has already won the 2015 Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship and a 2014 PGA Tour China event as a 16-year-old.
“I think I need one more step before I go to the top standard of professional golf,” said Jin to PGATour.com.
The Trojans’ coaching staff is certainly not complaining about his decision, but with such a solidified starting five, seeing where the young phenomenon fits in will be one of the most compelling storylines of the season.
The second freshman on the team, Kyle Suppa from Honolulu, may also push for playing time. He was ranked No. 33 on the Junior Golf Scoreboard upon graduating from high school. Even with past pedigrees, no player will be safe from competition for playing time this season.
The Trojans possess depth, talent and experience. This weekend, they will begin to chase the one thing they don’t have: a national championship. The chase begins in Chicago, where USC men’s golf will look to prove why it deserves to be considered one of the top teams in the nation.
“We probably have our deepest roster ever heading into this season,” Zambri said. “With that, our goal is to continue to improve on a weekly basis but to try to win every golf tournament we play. Where we are going in Chicago, Olympia Fields, will be a great test.”

On Monday, the Directors Guild of America published another analysis detailing the lack of diversity in Hollywood. In its analysis of television directors currently working in the industry, the organization found that of the 4,061 episodes of television filmed during the 2015-2016 season, only 702 females directed them. This means only 17 percent of television directing work is done by women. Sixteen percent of jobs went to men of color, while the absolute lowest number went to women of color at 3 percent (meaning Caucasians accounted for 14 percent of women directing jobs).
This isn’t news. I understand because I wrote about it last year when the DGA released a similar study and when other organizations have released their studies too. Lack of diversity is nothing new to the industry or to this column, and so it can feel a little redundant to restate.
“There’s a long road ahead for true change to be realized — because for that to happen, the pipeline will need to change at the point of entry,” said Paris Barclay, president of the DGA. “Employers will need to implement new hiring practices — from getting more people in the door and interviewing more diverse candidates.”
Both Barclay’s statement and the report urged me to think about what’s really happening in the industry, why these statistics keep repeating themselves and how students today can tackle these issue head-on. The solution must not be to simply inform employers to alter hiring practices, as this will only lead individuals to point fingers at someone other than the DGA.
In the 2014 Bloomberg documentary Celluloid Ceilings, director Maria Giese made a motion for further discussion in the DGA’s Women Diversity Committee to speak about allowing female minorities more opportunities.The DGA rejected the motion, and as a result, Giese claimed that people within the DGA metaphorically “blacklisted” her from working. I’m sure this isn’t the only case of denied motions or actions for the DGA — which has had only one female president in the 80 years of its existence. So, change has to come from elsewhere.
Next week, I will travel to Oregon to direct a short film I’ve written. While I am partly afraid to admit what I’m about to admit, I am also torn because I am so thankful to work with the crew I have. They were willing to work for reduced rates, travel a long distance and commit to the project, something I cannot thank them enough for. On the other hand, I’m frustrated.
In the last two months, I spent a lot of time searching for women to work with for this film — an excruciatingly difficult process. The crew I am ultimately using comes as a package deal — which is not uncommon — and yes, the crew is mostly men. Small production companies often work to create a team of in-house filmmakers and technicians (from production designers to gaffers to sound people) who are used to working with each other and working with producers. It benefits all parties and helps low-budget filmmakers who need things to run as smoothly as possible when they are creating something as volatile and prone to problems as filmmaking.
Don’t get me wrong — I do not have a prejudice against men, and the group I’m working with now is amazing. I completely understand their mentality of wanting to work with each other, because most of them share similar backgrounds and have known each other for years. But this opportunity has also made me reconsider my role as a woman in film school.
I do not know many female producers, nor do I know many female-centered production companies. Not to say they don’t exist, but there are definitely less women in these positions than men as I have seen from both the professional and educational levels. So, as I’m thinking about what can be done, I realize that change needs to begin here at USC, the best film school in the world. If it doesn’t begin here, where and when will it start?
Activist Maria Giese spoke to Fortune in 2015 about discrimination in Hollywood.
“Film school classes are 50-50 male and female because of Title IX,” Giese said. “Young women think this is going to be great, but don’t realize the level of bias they’re going to face in Hollywood.”
I find that perhaps this discrepancy is created by the differences in approaches between genders. Most female producers I know (or women who want to go into producing) opt for the more traditional route of interning, to assistant work to creative executive etc, while male producers tend to strike out on their own and form production companies out of school, working on low-budget projects of friends or friends of friends, rather than diving straight into the office right away.
I do admit that there is a certain level of optimism with going to classes, in which many of my peers are women. But we, as students, must face the facts and start making a change. We must stand united and create avenues for one another after we finish our education and make it into the real world.

Seafood lovers in Los Angeles are in luck — a new spot has launched to satisfy their cravings. Fish Time, a casual restaurant that brings fresh seafood to the surrounding community, started its business in Glendale in June. It features all kinds of raw and cooked seafood, including fish off the grill, poke bowls, sandwiches and inventive dishes such as fish tacos and burritos.
Photo courtesy of Fish TimeFish are food not friends · Fish Time is best known for its signature dish, California poke. It is the most popular and contains ahi tuna, salmon, sashimi and crab meat with wasabi and sesame seeds.
At Fish Time, spacious interior with simple design provides comfortable dining environment for the customers. Poke Bowl is the signature dish at Fish Time, while “California poke” is regarded as the most popular. Sashimi-rade Ahi tuna, salmon and a scoop of crabmeat blend perfectly with the creamy wasabi and sesame seeds. There are also pure tuna or salmon poke bowls to choose from, both of which can be made in the original or spicy flavors. All poke bowls come with rice, pickled cucumbers, avocado and nori, and additional ingredients such as seaweed are available.
If you are looking for something even healthier, the poke salad would be a good option. Besides all the vegetables that come in original poke bowls, extra tomatoes, edamame, carrots and ginger dressing definitely add more refreshing flavors to the poke.
As for sandwiches, the shrimp and crab melt is worth trying. Large, sweet shrimps and crab meat fully melt with hot cheese inside the toasted sourdough bread — every bite leads to an greater level of satisfaction. A small portion of cabbage salad comes as a side of fries and coleslaw to balance the sandwich’s richness.
In addition to the regular clam chowder, Fish Time also serves the innovative chowder fries, which are absolutely delicious. Chowder fries are crispy, piping hot French fries covered with thick, creamy clam chowder sauce and bacon bits. Fresh clams with chewy texture integrate well with the natural cut French fries — a game-changing creation to gratify hungry people.
Lobster roll in creamy garlic, spicy Cajun, or original flavor, shrimp taco, shrimp burrito and albacore steak are currently on the seasonal menu. However, even though Fish Time is a good place for quick lunch or weekend get together with friends, with a price range from $9 to $13, might be a little higher compared to other seafood-centric restaurants in the area.
It is open daily from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., with happy hour specials served from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Don’t forget to check in on Yelp and receive free crab quesadillas.

Zoe Cheng | Daily TrojanStacks on stacks on stacks · BrunchDTLA serves a wide variety of dishes, including vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. The $8 bibimbap breakfast burrito (above) is a must-try savory dish.
Nestled in a food court inside a bank of Downtown apartments, BrunchDTLA — which opened in late spring — is perhaps one of the few real hidden gems in the Los Angeles culinary scene. In a time when social media and food appear to go hand-in-hand, it is surprising that the new eatery has not been receiving more hype. With its long list of diverse and delicious fusion dishes, large portions and reasonable pricing, BrunchDTLA certainly deserves the city’s attention.
Split equally between breakfast and lunch options, the menu offers a bevy of enticing Asian fusion options, including the chicken sausage and farro fried rice, vegetable Panang curry and the bibimbap (a Korean rice, meat, and vegetable dish) breakfast burrito. Also available are more traditional American dishes like the “steak, eggs and sweet potato hash,” different breakfast sandwiches, pastas and salads. The main menu contains vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options. It is also complemented by a reasonably long list of specials as well as a beverage menu: Along with its diverse array of food, BrunchDTLA serves hydraulic pressed juices, coffee and tea.
Most menu items are priced around $7 or $8, fair for most dishes except perhaps the waffles — which, though deliciously sweet (specifically the Asian pear waffle with condensed milk), were too light to make someone feel full. On the other hand, the $8 bibimbap breakfast burrito is a recommended investment. The large burrito does not, perhaps, taste exactly as if someone had wrapped bibimbap the flavors inexplicably ring more true to breakfast burritos of an American stripe. But this burrito’s savory combination of beef, rice, cucumbers and fried egg can provide sustenance for the rest of the day. Even for someone who is not biased toward carbs and beef and burritos in general, the bibimbap burrito is actually a game-changer. That dish alone should put this joint on the map.
Nevertheless, a lot of what’s working against BrunchDTLA is its setting — the fact is, the quality of its food far exceeds the quality and location of the physical restaurant. The eatery isn’t necessarily hard to find — even though it is set within a small food court, a helpful sidewalk sign directs customers passing by on the street. Yet though located Downtown near the Ace Hotel, BrunchDTLA is still pretty easy to miss unless a customer knows what to look for.
The visual dissonance between BrunchDTLA’s actual restaurant and its food is indeed jarring. Where the food is warm, heavily-portioned and inviting, the restaurant itself is very bare: The only external sign of the eatery’s ingenuity being a Rolling Stone-esque mouth screaming “BRUNCH” sketched out on a chalkboard wall. Despite BrunchDTLA’s somewhat bald appearance, interested customers should still have faith and order something. The food that comes out from behind those kitchen doors will not disappoint. In fact, this is some of the best brunch food that Los Angeles has to offer. Not only are the dishes tasty, they are also original. The flavors are enhanced by the daringness of the dishes themselves, a quality few restaurants can claim to have.
Located in a food court among the colorful and eclectic Santee Court Lofts, BrunchDTLA is open from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekends.

Elizabeth Gu | Daily Trojan
Several smoking restriction bills were signed earlier this year by Gov. Jerry Brown. These included raising the age to buy tobacco from 18 to 21, as well as broadening the types of workplaces that must ban tobacco use on their premises, among other stipulations.
Now, Brown finds himself facing the State Assembly’s legislation to ban smoking or disposal of tobacco products on all campuses of the California State University and California Community College systems by 2018. Seeing Brown’s previous willingness to raise the tobacco age, chances are that he would agree to these bills as well. The State Assembly passed these by a 41-24 vote and this swooping majority showcases the state’s view about tobacco consumption in general, not just cigarette smoking itself.
The ban on smoking in state-owned or operated beaches and parks finds its roots in the environmental and health-related arguments. Assemblyman Kevin McCarty argues that this bill needs to be approved by Brown to ensure a better life for the campus staff, students and faculty as it “addresses the harmful health effects that come with smoking and secondhand smoke on our college campuses.”
This potential ban was preceded by the adoption of a tobacco-free policy on a few California campuses that took effect in 2014. Cal State Fullerton has already fully adopted the policy by banning it on campus. USC, too, needs to address its own smoking concerns. Currently, smoking is not allowed inside public establishments, and smokers have to be at least 20 feet from a building to light up. To accommodate students who do not smoke, there are multiple designated smoke-free areas around campus. This policy has been around for a long time, but looking at the current trend and the way other neighboring schools are moving away from smoking or secondhand smoke, it becomes crucial to acknowledge how harmful smoking really is.
As of spring 2012, 14.4 percent of USC students smoked daily or one or more days a week, according to a report by the USC American College Health Association-National College Health Assessment. The same study found that undergraduates smoke more frequently than graduate students. So, if that is the case, in these past three to four years, it may not have decreased. This begs the question of whether students actually realize that cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States. It also leads to about 90 percent of all lung cancer deaths in men and 80 percent in women. Considering the kind of facts that surround smoking, one would expect USC to become more rigid with its policies after all, as Sen. Marty Block pointed out, cigarettes are non-biodegradable and contain more than 164 toxic chemicals which create a substantial trash and health issue. USC must account not only for health hazards, but environmental concerns as well. Even UCLA adopted a restriction on smoking on campus in 2013 and became the first of the UC schools to do so. So shouldn’t we follow UCLA’s footsteps and attempt to make a difference in the lives of all those who come to USC everyday, from the security personnel to the student body? Rigidity could revolutionize and increase the lifespan of all those who call themselves proud members of the Trojan Family.
Reject the smoking ban and retain designated smoking areas.
Consider Boffetta, et al: Multicenter Case-Control Study of Exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Lung Cancer in Europe, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 90, No. 19, October 7, 1998: “public indoor settings did not represent an important source of ETS exposure.”
(This case-control study used data from the IARC. The period of enrollment of case and control subjects was from 1988 to 1994–16 years; IARC=International Agency for Research on Cancer.}
In addition, this large study looked at 38 years worth of data:
Engstrom, JE and Kabat, GC. Environmental tobacco smoke and tobacco related mortality in a prospective study of Californians, 1960-98 BMJ 2003; 326:1057.
This study found “No significant associations were found for current or former exposure to environmental tobacco smoke before or after adjusting for seven confounders and before or after excluding participants with pre-existing disease.” (This prospective study used American Cancer Society dataset.)

Presently, it is still uncertain who will claim victory in the November presidential election. Regardless of who wins, millennials stand to play a substantially larger role in this election cycle than those in years past.
In order for millennials to vote intelligently and in line with their interests beyond presidential policy, an often overlooked factor of American government must be examined: the ability of the President to nominate Supreme Court Justices. The Justices of the Supreme Court have immense power given that they must deliberate over issues that touch upon the bedrock of American conceptions of rights and government. Not only do they rule on core constitutional issues such as free speech, right to privacy and equal protection of the law, they also are appointed for life. Their opinions will hold sway for decades after their appointment. As such, if millennials desire to influence the composition of the Supreme Court in the coming years, they ought to pay close attention to the Supreme Court nominees that both candidates are likely to bring to the consideration of the Senate.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has released a short list of judges that he believes will be assets to the composition of the Supreme Court. While they hail from several states and disparate jurisdictions, Trump’s list of judges share with each other their professional experience and general conservatism. This is unsurprising, given Trump’s own conservativism and his praise of the late Justice Antonin Scalia, whose originalist approach to the terms of the Constitution was exceedingly well-known and respected among American conservatives. While they have their individual distinctions and quirks, Trump’s nominees appear relatively homogenous in their judicial philosophy.
Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, has not published a similar short list of likely nominees. Nonetheless, there is consensus about who is likely to be on such a list, whether or not it is public knowledge. Perhaps most obviously positioned to become a Supreme Court Justice is current federal judge Merrick Garland. Garland heads the United States Court of Appeals as Chief Judge. Garland’s record as a judge has been widely described as moderate, but his more nuanced positions may be of more interest to millennials.
Garland’s position on the First Amendment is of chief importance; Garland has presided over several cases involving Freedom of Information Act requests, and has overwhelmingly supported more transparent government and freedom of the press. These are qualities in government that millennials tend to support. The next consideration in favor of many millennials is present in Garland’s few cases involving environmental regulation. In these cases, Garland has appeared to be generally in favor of government environmental protection. Finally, Garland appears to be sympathetic to plaintiffs suing under whistleblower laws, which is another boon to those who favor more accountable government.
However, Garland has some positions that may run counter to conventional Democratic and millennial objectives. Garland determined in 2003 that the federal judiciary could not hear cases filed by Guantanamo Bay detainees. His position was overturned by the Supreme Court in its 2008 Boumediene v. Bush decision, but his deference to the federal government in criminal matters may still be unsettling to some on the left. Garland is nonetheless the most likely candidate, given that he has already been nominated and is an easier pill to swallow for Republicans than some of Clinton’s other potential nominees, like the comparatively liberal ex-public defender Judge Jane Kelley of the 8th Circuit Court of Public Appeals and Justice Goodwin Liu of the California Supreme Court.
Clinton’s likely nominees are not all hardline liberals, however, in contrast to Donald Trump’s list of conservative judges. Judge Sri Srinivasan of the D.C. Circuit, another very likely nominee from the Clinton camp, is not clearly left-wing. His decisions suggest an even-handed temperament that may lean left in only some cases. Judge Paul Watford of the Ninth Circuit fits a similar description, and Judge Patricia Millett of the D.C. Circuit is also not terribly left-leaning. These judges, if nominated, present choices that would be much easier for Senate Republicans to agree with if they come away from the election with a majority in the Senate. And given that it would be Clinton nominating these judges, Senate Democrats would be unlikely to oppose them. These potential Supreme Court Justices stand to advance left-leaning objectives in the Supreme Court, even if they are not the sort of spirited liberals that some Democrats may want to see on the bench.
Given that most millennials are Democrats or describe themselves as Democrat-leaning, Clinton’s likely nominees are important for them to get to know. Clinton and her judicial objectives may not represent the whole of the millennial population, but for a substantial number of them, those potential are their best bet for representation in the federal judiciary.

Osa Masina, who is involved in multiple sexual assault investigations, has been removed from USC, attorney to his attorney – Photo courtesy USC Sports Information
Sophomore linebacker Osa Masina has been removed from USC, his attorney said on Tuesday. The announcement comes just hours after it was announced that Masina and teammate redshirt sophomore Don Hill were suspended from all football activities.
The two reserves are being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department for sexual assault but have not been charged.
“He’s now been removed from the school all together, not just the football team,” Salt Lake City-based attorney Greg Skordas said. “He’s not allowed to practice. He’s not even allowed to be on the campus.”
Skordas said Masina was informed of the University’s decision on Friday and has since returned to his family in Utah.
Earlier on Tuesday, head coach Clay Helton announced that both players would be suspended from the team.
“Under the University’s further guidance, it has been decided that they have been suspended from participation with our football team,” head coach Clay Helton said Tuesday afternoon.
Masina and Hill were not allowed to play in either of the Trojans’ first two games this season but were practicing with the team and permitted to attend team meetings.
USC released a statement addressing the players’ suspension from the football team.
“Based on additional information obtained by the University, Osa Masina and Don Hill have been suspended from participation with USC Athletics and the football team,” the statement said. “To protect the rights of the students and comply with federal privacy laws no other details will be provided.”
Masina was served with a search warrant that allowed police to collect his iPhone and DNA samples on Aug. 25. He was suspended from the team’s season opener on Aug. 29 for an unspecified violation of team rules.
Hill traveled with the team to Arlington for their season opener, but was sent home and did not play.
Masina is also under investigation in Utah for a separate sexual assault case involving the same woman.

Q: There are so many things that I could do on campus, but I don’t know where to start! How did you begin exploring your interests? Also, how do I tell if I am spreading myself too thin with all of my activities?
Fun fact: USC has over 800 recognized student organizations. EIGHT. HUNDRED. That’s a whole lot and it can definitely be overwhelming. But… that number also means there’s definitely an organization and space for you. So, start looking! A great place to start is on the Campus Activities website. You can use this link to search and find organizations you may want to join!
Now, in terms of exploring your interests and trying different organizations… keep the process simple! Go to a general meeting, talk to a member of the organization, and decide if you want to return. Whether you’re new to campus or just looking for something else to be a part of… going once (or twice or many times) will never hurt! From my experiences, everyone is always so nice and they aren’t offended if you don’t come back. Also, when you find something you might really like– I encourage you to stick with it! Be engaged, go to meetings, join their executive boards in the coming semesters, and try to actively learn as much as you can.
Lastly, in terms of “spreading yourself too thin,” I think time management is a skill that ironically… comes with time. As a freshman, I tried so many different activities and I don’t regret a minute of it. I learned so much and I got to meet so many people on this campus. But, I also wasn’t taking very difficult courses. As I become a leader within organizations (which I’m sure you’ll do too), it was important for me to take note of my responsibilities and what I was capable of. Classes got more challenging in the following years and understanding my role as a student and how that affected my role as a campus leader was incredibly important. Everyone at USC is hyper-ambitious (honestly, look at the number of organizations on this campus) and that’s great. But, we all have different limits and taking care of ourselves should be our number 1 priority. So, when you’re deciding on leadership roles and/or the number of activities you want on your plate, I urge you to think of how many hours are required of you. Then, think about how many hours of school work you might have. If you’re doing over X amount of hours (whatever you deem acceptable) of work, that might be too much. So know your limits and own up to them. It makes you a better person and a less stressed individual! 
So…a lot was said but overall lesson of the story: get involved, stay involved (within a healthy range), and take care of yourself!
