Exploring the sights, sounds and tastes of Downtown Los Angeles will soon be easier for USC students. The Undergraduate Student Government, USC Transportation and LA Live have finalized plans for a free shuttle running from campus to the nearby sports and entertainment venues.
“I think it’s really important to know that we now have a safe and reliable way for students to plug into the Downtown entertainment and night scene,” USG President Holden Slusher said. “I’m really excited for students to get out and take advantage of Los Angeles. It’s going to be great for students to have this diverse opportunity.”
Beginning in November, USC students can take advantage of a free shuttle from USC to Downtown’s entertainment hub, LA Live. The shuttle, funded by LA Live, will run on weekends and will depart from in front of The Lab every half hour. - Dieuwertje Kast | Daily Trojan
The shuttle will start running on Nov. 6, stopping at Figueroa Street in front of The Lab and on a private street between the Staples Center and the Nokia Theatre, said Tony Mazza, director of USC Transportation.
Departing every 30 minutes,  the shuttle is scheduled to make the 2.5-mile trek to LA Live on Fridays from 6 p.m. to
2 a.m., on Saturdays from 2 p.m. to 2 a.m. and on Sundays from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m.
Funding for the shuttle will come solely from LA Live, Mazza said, though USC Transportation will provide the necessary bus and drivers.
“There’s a mutual benefit. [LA Live] gets to tap into a market that could potentially not be going to LA Live, and we get an opportunity to provide a safe ride to our students so they can enjoy a part of Downtown Los Angeles that they would not have normally enjoyed,” Mazza said. “This is something that we wanted to do, but our budget couldn’t support it, so we
needed to find a way we could provide the benefit but defray the cost.”
Changes in the shuttle’s schedule, along with the potential addition of more shuttles to LA Live, could take place in the future depending on student feedback and demand.
Although the shuttle is scheduled to run every weekend, it may have to cease operation when streets around LA Live close because of high-profile events and awards shows.
They are also considering not running the shuttle over the Thanksgiving and winter breaks, Mazza added.
Bringing an LA Live shuttle to USC has been a point of discussion among USG, USC Transportation and LA LIVE officials since last year, said Helen Moser, USG’s director of campus affairs.
“This was something that was started with the last administration. This is something they had talked about and really wanted to push,” Moser said. “As soon as USG saw there was this great venue next to campus that students would want to go to, we started looking into the idea of offering transportation for that.”
On Sept. 1, USG conducted a survey to gauge student interest in a shuttle to LA Live. After 97 percent of the 1,767 respondents said they would take advantage of a shuttle if it were available, USG officials partnered with USC Transportation to make it a reality, Moser said.
Although previous meetings with LA Live officials had been unsuccessful, USG and USC Transportation approached the company again and resumed negotiations. Having recently undergone a change in management, LA Live was more receptive to the idea and ultimately agreed to fund the shuttle’s operation, Mazza said.
“There’s a buzz on campus about it. I think that LA Live opens up a whole new opportunity for [students] to get a bite to eat, to catch a movie, to explore — even if they only spend a couple hours there. I really think people will take advantage of it,” Mazza said.
Many students said they are looking forward to using the shuttle, primarily because of its convenience and safety.
“It definitely gives us a lot more options now, especially those of us who don’t have a car,” said Sarah Hivner, a junior majoring in fine arts. “It’s nice to have a USC bus. It’s nice knowing you’re getting on the right bus and not worrying.”
But Laila Ekboir, a senior majoring in English, said she believes the shuttle limits students’ entertainment options to LA Live and is unnecessary because there are other means of public transportation.
“The tram is for people who are afraid to take the Dash, which goes to LA Live anyway. The Dash is reliable,” Ekboir said. “USC should eradicate those irrational fears and help the city advertise the [public transportation] service.”
Moser said she still anticipates the shuttle will improve campus life and hopes its launch will create stronger ties between USG, the administration and the student body.
“It shows the administration really listens to what students want,” she said. “It’s going to be great momentum for us for other projects we’ll be taking on.”
The “private street” referred to may not be Chick Hearn. Chick Hearn is in fact a public street, but LA LIVE does have a private road (behind the Nokia Theatre, in between the West Parking Garage and the REGAL Cinemas) that connects to Georgia Street and will be opening next week. This may or may not be the drop of point for the shuttle, but just know that there is actually a private street at LA LIVE that is more or less centrally located between the cinemas and the rest of the campus.
This is kind of sad actually because it falls 3 blocks short of the Metro Station where most of the trains and busses come through not to mention that it’s kind of sad that someone else had to fund the route for USC…
This mediocre “shuttle” service shouldn’t really be called “Tram” service,
 because “Tram” throughout the world (including U.S.) is understood as Streetcars.
 If USC students (as well as other Angelenos) want a truly  reliable  service,
real Streetcars should be provided! (similar to the Bringing Back Broadway project),
not some shuttles…
Hopefully one day we’ll have streetcars (aka the Real Trams) running throughout the entire Downtown,
including USC
On Wednesday, an Expo official said Expo to Crenshaw should open in 2010 and Expo to Culver City should open in 2011.
While the Expo Line opening sequence is far from finalized, I think its safe to say USC will get plugged into Metro Rail far before “December 2011.”
Why does the article say “private street” instead of “Chick Hearn Court” (i.e. the street betwee Staples and Nokia theater)? It’s not secretive. Expect this service to shut down by next December early 2011 when the Expo Line opens, so it’s only temporary.
On which “private street” will the tram be stopping?
This is an excellent idea whose time has come.  I applaud the Undergraduate Student Government and LA Live for this creative solution that is sure to benefit all parties concerned.  As a parent of two USC students that do not have cars on campus, I appreciate  students having the opportunity to get off campus via safe and reliable transportation in order  to “change the scenery”, and  avail themselves of LA Live and other shopping in the area.
then why not have USC and LA Live coordinate with the city to improve DASH service into the night so students and community members can travel all over Downtown? why make transportation exclusive?
Ditto… the Dash bus is great… as long as you can be where you want to go and back before 6 in the evening. This student tram starts after the Dash closes, and runs very late into the night. This is so students can go downtown to either late movies, or to nightlife, and not have to worry about: A. Paying for a ridiculously expensive taxi B. Walking or biking to a bus stop at night C. Drunkenly taking a bus or getting into other trouble. Metro buses, like the 81, do run late at night, but only like once an hour, and at extremely unpredictable times. This is a great solution.
Laila- please refer to the Dash schedule – it ends service at 6.30pm week nights and weekends – ends at 5pm. So this is not an option and therefore the tram is perfect.

Three separate but similar incidents in the past month have authorities looking for a man with a penchant for feet.
The first incident occurred Sept. 11, by 37th and Catalina streets. A female student — a junior majoring in print journalism who chose to remain anonymous — said she was riding her bike to her friend’s house around 3:30 p.m. when the suspect gestured for her to ride over to him.
The man told her he was a podiatry student at USC conducting research on the arches of people’s feet and would like to look at her feet.
“He was like, ‘I was wondering if I could take a look at your arch.’ I told him no, and that I was late meeting my friend. He was like, ‘You know what, it’ll only take two seconds, I just have to look at your foot,’” the student said. “Because I was wearing flip flops, I held out my foot.”
After the student held out her foot, the man began to massage and fondle her feet. When the student realized the man was not actually a podiatry student, she tried to walk away but he yanked her foot back and began kissing it.
“He told me, ‘You have beautiful feet, you should thank me for kissing your foot with my lips,’” the student said.
The student then pulled back her foot away, rode away and called the USC Department of Public Safety.
Another female student reported Monday that as she was riding her bicycle by 37th and Catalina, a man gestured for her to stop.
She ignored him and continued toward her apartment, but the man followed and asked her twice if he could look at her feet. The man claimed to be an orthopedist. The student refused both times, then went inside her apartment and called DPS.
A third female student reported Tuesday that while she was walking near Century Apartments, a man approached her asking to see her feet. This time, the man claimed to be a shoemaker.
The student refused the request, and the suspect walked to a vehicle parked nearby.
The student had heard of similar incidents occurring in the past, so she took down the suspect’s license plate number and contacted DPS.
DPS Capt. David Carlisle said although these are suspicious circumstances that should be reported to DPS, no crime has been committed yet.
“If someone asks for consent and a student gives it to them, it’s not a crime,” Carlisle said. “If he did fondle someone against their will, then it could be considered a sexual battery, but thus far that hasn’t happened. He approached two other people who did not fall for his proposal. We will have to see where this leads.”
DPS Chief John Thomas said the students who reported the encounters gave thorough descriptions each time. The man was described by all three students as a 20- to 25-year-old Hispanic male with spiky hair. DPS believes there is only one suspect acting repeatedly.
“This is odd behavior. Who knows what else he may be up to, so we want to get this person identified,” Carlisle said.
Thomas said DPS is working with LAPD to identify the suspect and they have dedicated additional resources to both areas where the suspect has been spotted.
“We’ve added extra officers and we’re working with LAPD to ensure that their resources are aware of this individual’s description,” Thomas said.
Brooke Parker, a junior majoring in violin performance who lives in Century, said that despite these incidents, she still feels safe walking off campus.
“If you’re careful, it’s not that dangerous,” Parker said. “I always feel safe because Century is so close to campus, and since we have those new [security ambassadors], I feel like someone is always watching.”
This is known a feeter.  He loves the feet.

In an effort to close the cultural gap between international and domestic students and to introduce the student body to cultural diversity on campus, the International Student Assembly is hosting USC’s first Multicultural Carnival Saturday in McCarthy Quad.
With the largest number of international students of any university in the United States, USC has 41 countries represented in its student body.

But, many of those students struggle with adapting to the social and cultural gaps between international and domestic students, according to Eshan Saluja, director of programming and development for ISA.
“I think there is a huge gap between international students and domestic students,” said Saluja, a junior majoring in business administration. “Even though USC has the largest international population, the problem is that there is not that much interaction apart from class or group work. Americans hang out with Americans, Chinese with Chinese and Indian with Indian.”
ISA is hoping the carnival, slated to run from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., will serve as a jumping-off point for students from different cultures to interact with one another. The carnival will include booths from different international student organizations on campus, featuring culture-specific activities such as a chopstick game with the Chinese Students Association, as well as samples of the country’s cuisine.
“We are trying to encourage the connection between different nationality groups … including domestic students,” said Matthew Leung, executive director of the ISA and a sophomore majoring in business finance.
The Carnival will feature international activities, and also some traditionally American pastimes.
Leung said the ISA is hoping to attract even more visitors to the carnival by broadcasting the USC-Notre Dame game on a high-definition TV.
“We are trying to see if we can incorporate American culture with the different international games so we don’t involve only international students and so we can attract domestic students,” he said. “Also, international students can learn about football, which is an American experience as well as a Trojan experience.”
A number of students planning to participate in the event said they are looking forward to a chance to promote their own culture.
“Apart from wanting to get to know other cultures, we want to tell other people about our culture,” said Silviana Hurniawan, a junior majoring in communication and the public relations officer for the Association of Indonesian Students. “Apart from the disaster, I don’t think anybody has any idea of what Indonesian culture is like.”
Others are hoping the carnival will help integrate international and domestic students on campus.
“There is a disconnect. Even though I feel like people are trying to push us together, there is a still a gap,” said Siyucu Fan, a junior from China who is majoring in design. “[But] I think the carnival will be good. It’s a good way to introduce cultures.”
The turnout and success of the carnival — ISA is hoping to get around 1,000 attendees — will determine whether it will become a tradition, Leung said.
“It’s amazing the opportunity our domestic students have to get to know and experience so many countries represented here at USC,” Becky Peterson, an international student advisor at the Office of International Services, wrote in an email.

One of the newest cultural clubs on campus offers a chance to celebrate culture in a unique way: through powwows and rituals.
The new Native American Culture Club was created this semester to fill what some saw as a void on campus.
Rev. Jim Burklo, associate dean of Religious Life, sparked the club’s creation. While working at Stanford University in a religious office, Burklo said he often observed students frequenting the Native American Studies office, admiring the active cultural center for Native Americans at the school.
At USC, Burklo said, he saw an “empty place in the club offerings,” and decided to help found a Native American Cultural Club on campus.
“Native American culture can be a useful model for the role of spirituality in life,” Burklo said. “Americans tend to think of religion as a set of beliefs, whereas Native Americans weave culture and religion together. It is
something that all religions can learn from.”
At the start of the semester, Burklo approached Antonia Blumberg, a sophomore anthropology major who works in the Office of Religious Life, and enlisted her to help with starting up the club.
Blumberg said the club is intended for students of Native American ancestry as well as those, like herself, who simply have an interest in native cultures and traditions.
She said the club focuses on Native American spirituality and rituals.
“We want to celebrate native ancestry with powwows, sun dances and visiting healers and chiefs,” Blumberg said.
To keep a religious focus, the club emphasizes animistic spirituality at its events. Many tribes share a common belief that spirits are present in all earthly objects including rocks, trees and animals, Blumberg said.
At one recent meeting, members of the club performed a ritual sweat lodge — a group therapy session where attendees sit and share emotions and concerns, according to Merisenda Bills, a junior majoring in broadcast journalism who participated in the sweat lodge.
Bills said she has a Native American great-grandmother, and joined the club because she is interested in learning more about Native American culture and practices. She also hopes the club will help the Native American culture gain more exposure.
“There are so many people of Native American ancestry in LA and not many people know about it,” Bills said. “This club should open their minds and expand their knowledge on their culture.”

The No. 16 USC women’s volleyball team (13-4, 2-3) is heading north to face off against Washington State (14-3, 3-3) and No. 4 Washington (15-1, 5-1) this weekend after coming back from a brutal 3-0 sweep by the UCLA Bruins.
“I thought we could have won the UCLA game with a couple breaks,” coach Mick Haley said. “The players fought really hard, and they didn’t win by hammering us.”
The team studied its mistakes on tape against UCLA, leaving Haley with high hopes of what he will see in Washington this weekend.
“I have pretty high expectations about this weekend,” Haley said. “Practice went really well, and they played really hard. We have to go to [Pullman, Wash.] and play extremely hard because we need a win after getting beat last week.”
Winning on the road has proven to be a harder task this year than before, not just for USC, but for most of the teams in the conference. Haley attributed this to the fact that everyone has upped their game this year.
“Each team in the conference is extremely good this year,” he said. “It’s really increased competition on everyone to play better.”
Washington State is coming to the match against the Women of Troy after a four-set loss to then-No. 7 Stanford and a sweep from No. 14 California. The Cougars are hitting .262 together as a team, while leading the Pac-10 in digs (16.21 digs per set) and taking second place in kills per set (14.35).
In the history of play between the Cougars and the Women of Troy, USC comes out on top, leading an all-time series with a 36-11 margin, and winning the last eight consecutive matches against WSU.
USC’s travel schedule this weekend may also have an impact on their energy. Taking two flights to Washington — as well as bouncing between Seattle, Spokane, Wash. and Pullman with bus rides — the travel will be enough to wear them out.
“We just have to approach them one match at a time,” Haley said. “We have to get the first one and then go after the second one with absolute intensity to get the chance to take out the No. 4 team in their hometown.”
The University of Washington has been playing well this season, but is coming to this weekend’s match with a sweep against California, followed by an unexpected five-set loss to then-No. 7 Stanford, their first loss of the season.  The Huskies are hitting .325 together as a team, have the lead in the opponent hitting percentage (.126), and are second in kills (14.35 kps) and serving aces (1.86 saps).
USC has not won a game in Seattle since 2004.
“It’s all up in the air,” he said. “We can’t get too down after a loss, especially since we know we have games like the five set win against Cal in us. We lost to Stanford on our home floor and it was not very much fun, but I have a feeling that when we play hard this weekend, we can show Washington just how that feels.”
Hey, what about the DT’s football coverage.  Clearly not enough!

Fresh off its best team performance of the season at the Vanguard Invitational, the USC women’s cross country team will travel to the San Fernando Valley for Friday’s Cal State Northridge Invitational.
In what coach Tom Walsh says will be the last race before he chooses which runners will race at the Pac-10 Championships in two weeks, the Women of Troy will feature most of their top runners and figure to be right near the top of the pack on Friday.
“The competition will be better quality than it was at the Vanguard Invite,” Walsh said. “But I think our girls are in a much better position than they were a month ago.”
Walsh attributed his confidence not only to the team’s strong performance at Vanguard, but also to the boost in morale that he has seen since the Women of Troy won that meet.
“Our confidence is much higher,” Walsh said. “After we had our first hard workout since the Vanguard meet, the girls ran really well. There was definitely something extra there.”
“We were a frustrated team because we knew we were doing really well in practices but it wasn’t showing up in races. Vanguard was the first meet where we said ‘OK, we’re going to be fine,’” Walsh said.
Walsh said that although his team is confident, they are still keeping things realistic.
“We’d like to be in the top two or three as a team,” Walsh said. “We’re holding out three good runners [senior Katherine Ellis, freshman Kelly Owen, sophomore Leah Gaeta]. With that in mind, my goal is to just try and keep the momentum that we have going.”
The Women of Troy will face teams from San Diego State, UC Riverside, UC Santa Barbara, Cal State Fullerton and host Cal State Northridge, among others. USC will counter with a group that includes top juniors Zsofia Erdelyi and Christine Cortez, as well as senior captain Bridget Helgerson and freshman standout Kathleen Moloney. After the Northridge meet, Walsh will have the difficult task of choosing either eight or nine girls to make up his Pac-10 Championships squad.
“It’s going to be hard for me,” Walsh said. “There are so many girls within a few seconds of each other that someone’s going to be left out. I attribute that to our depth this year.”
When asked what he will base his choices on, however, Walsh made it clear that he would not go strictly by the numbers.
“I’m going to base it on performance throughout the season, yes,” Walsh said. “But I’m also going to choose those who I feel can run best in a big meet. There are girls that can run when the pressure isn’t on. I want to try to select the eight that can run well when the pressure is on.”
The Cal State Northridge Invitational will provide the Women of Troy one last chance to prove themselves, both as a team and as individuals, before the Pac-10 Championships on Oct. 30. The Northridge 6K race begins at 4:45 p.m.

The No. 1 USC women’s golf team goes north this week looking to continue an excellent start to the fall season.
After opening with a victory at the Mason Rudolph Championship in September, the Women of Troy look to earn their second consecutive victory at the three-day Stanford Intercollegiate at the Stanford Golf Course in Palo Alto, Calif.
Leading the team this weekend is sophomore Jennifer Song, who is looking for her second career victory after capturing the individual title at the Mason Rudolph. Song, a returning first-team All-American, is hoping to capitalize on her recent success with another victory this week.
“I was trying to strengthen myself physically because I was getting worn out from competing all summer,” Song said, referring to the three-week layoff since her last match.
She looks to use the Stanford tournament as another step in achieving her goal of averaging under 70 for the season. Her scoring average thus far is 66.
Making her season debut for the Women of Troy is senior Belen Mozo, returning from summer shoulder surgery.
The three-time All-American “had some pain during the spring…when we went to Nationals,”  coach Andrea Gaston said. “The doctor felt surgery was going to be the best way to get her through.”
Joining the All-Americans are senior Caroline Kim, sophomore Inah Park and freshman Cyna Rodriguez. Kim, in her second season as a regular contributor for the team, tied for 30th in her season debut, and plans to improve on her 38th place finish at last season’s Stanford Intercollegiate.
Park, also in her second season as a regular contributor, tied for 30th with Kim at the Mason Rudolph, and tied for 72nd at the Stanford Intercollegiate last season in the start of her Trojan career. Rodriguez made her Trojan debut at the Mason Rudolph, tying for 40th. All of them are competing for a permanent roster spot this year, and seek to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the absence of  All-American junior Lizette Salas and senior Stephanie Endstrasser.
The Women of Troy jumped to the No. 1 spot after their win at the Mason Rudolph. The Stanford Intercollegiate features No. 2 UCLA, No. 3 Arizona State, No. 7 California and four other top-25 teams. Still, the added pressure of the top ranking isn’t getting to the team.
“I just think about the game I’ll be playing and play it one shot at a time,” Song said. “I don’t really think about being number one.”

The last two matchups between USC and Notre Dame haven’t exactly been close. The Trojans won 38-3 in 2008 and 38-0 in 2007.
And this time, No. 6 USC (4-1) is coming off of a dominating 30-3 win over Cal, and No. 25 Notre Dame (4-1) has won its last three games by a combined 13 points.
So why are the Trojans not the overwhelming favorite to beat the Fighting Irish on what is expected to be a frigid Saturday afternoon in South Bend, Ind.?
Damian Williams (18) celebrates with Jeff Byers (53) and Kristofer O’Dowd (61) after a touchdown against Notre Dame in 2008.
“If you look at rankings, that’s where you get beat,” redshirt junior receiver Damian Williams said. “We beat a ranked team and then lost to an unranked team. The ranking doesn’t mean much, but this is a big rivalry for us.”
The rivalry between USC and Notre Dame is indeed a storied one. Saturday will mark the 83rd time the teams have met, with Notre Dame the victor in 42 games.
USC has won the last seven battles — dating back to the second year of coach Pete Carroll’s tenure.
But there’s no clear path to victory for the Trojans. They’ve had their own bumps in the road in 2009.
The Trojans have beat Ohio State and Cal on the road, but they have also lost to a Washington team fresh off of a 15-game losing streak and failed to cover the spread against a pitiful Washington State team.
It’s safe to say that both teams are essentially in a must-win situation.
For USC, it’s a chance to rack up another top-25 road victory. A loss would mean elimination from national championship contention.
For Notre Dame?
“USC is one of the best teams in the country,” Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis said. “They’ve beaten us seven times in a row — that’s really the bottom line. Some of them have been ugly. So I think winning this week would do wonders for the spirits of everyone affiliated with Notre Dame.”
The Trojans will have the services of three key players returning from injuries.
Junior wide receiver Ronald Johnson is expected to make his season debut after breaking his collarbone in the fall mock game. Sophomore defensive lineman Armond Armstead broke his left foot in a practice accident and has been practicing with the team since last week. Redshirt freshman cornerback Brian Baucham has missed the last three games after a motorcycle accident last month, but he’s making the trip to South Bend.
The plan is for all three to split time in the rotations at their respective positions.
As for the Fighting Irish, they bring a talented offense to the table.
Junior quarterback Jimmy Clausen leads the nation in passing efficiency. Junior wide receiver Golden Tate, who Carroll likened to “a running back at receiver,” has proven a true dual threat while lining up at both spots. Junior tailback Armando Allen Jr. has put up two 100-yard games already.
“They’re a team that’s interesting,” Carroll said. “They’re willing to throw the ball a bunch if they think that’s what’s necessary in the game plan. Sometimes they’ll go the other way. They’re not a set style that you can tell what they’re going to do in a game plan.”
Save for its season opener, though, every Notre Dame contest has had a set style: They haven’t been decided until the finish.
First, Michigan’s freshman quarterback Tate Forcier threw the game-winning score with 11 seconds remaining to shock the Irish. Then, a touchdown pass from Clausen to tight end Kyle Rudolph with 25 seconds left gave the Irish the victory over Purdue. Tate caught a 33-yard bomb for what would be the game-winner with five minutes left in the Michigan State game. The Washington game didn’t end until overtime.
“They have the confidence of being able to hang in very difficult games and come back and win and all of that,” Carroll said. “All that just adds to your mindset. They’ve got to be just about as strong as they’ve been in years.”
Clausen has been the constant behind most of Notre Dame’s success. He’s completed more than 67.6 percent of his passes this season for 1544 yards and 12 touchdowns — a marked improvement from his freshman year, when he finished the season with just seven touchdown passes and was forced to miss the USC game due to an injury.
“I think they’re a lot better team than they were then,” Williams said. “A lot of the younger guys from the past couple years have developed. I think the experience factor is the reason why they’re a lot better team.”
And the rivalry?
“We have a lot riding on it,” Williams said.

After reclaiming the No. 1 ranking, the USC men’s water polo team will be put to the test against fellow Mountain Pacific Sports Federation member No. 7 Long Beach State this Saturday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
The Trojans (16-1, 3-0) previously sat at No. 3 following a one-goal loss to UCLA at the NorCal Tournament, but after nine consecutive victories — including six over a three day span last weekend — the Trojans return to the spot that they held going into the season.
Sophomore two-meter Matt Burton says regaining the No. 1 ranking means a lot to the the Trojans, as they take on a fiercly competitive Long Beach State team Saturday at McDonald’s Swim Stadium. - Jonathan Wong|Daily Trojan
“It meant a lot to us [to regain No. 1], we want to get back to the top, we know everyone’s gunning for us,” sophomore two-meter Matt Burton said.
Earlier this season, the Trojans visited Long Beach to compete in the 49ers’ (6-6, 0-1) season opener, handedly defeating Long Beach State 12-3. In the game, Burton and senior driver Justin Rappel both had hat tricks to help the Trojans cruise to victory.
The teams’ first matchup was a non-conference affair, but this time their meeting is the beginning of Trojans’ Mountain Pacific Sports Federation schedule. The Trojans will play five of their final six games against MPSF foes before the beginning of the MPSF tournament in late November.
After not going a weekend without playing at least two games since their first match up with the 49ers, the Trojans will not play back-to-back games within five days of each other until the MPSF Championships.
But the Trojans know that it’s important to keep focus and take advantage of their less physically demanding MPSF schedule.
“We’re really taking this opportunity when we have just one game a week to get in the best shape that we can,” Burton said. “The coaches have planned a really intense training schedule for this week and next week, twice as many morning practices and the afternoon practices are tougher.”
A victory over Long Beach State, which would be the Trojan’s 36th consecutive home win, would extend the Trojans all-time record against the 49ers to 56-15.
Long Beach State’s senior center Jeff Greenwood was their leading scorer last season, and will head a balanced 49er attack that also features last season’s third team All-MPSF senior goalie Dereck Weibe-Bailey.
The same 49ers team that looked so dangerous before the two teams first met will come to campus holding a grudge, which makes them even more dangerous in the eyes of the experienced Trojans.
“They’re always fierce competitors. They’ll definitely come with a chip on their shoulder. I’m sure they don’t appreciate what we did to them last time,” Burton said.

After piling up nine consecutive victories, the No. 9 USC women’s soccer team will face its toughest test yet when they head north this weekend to take on No. 1 Stanford and No. 21 Cal.
The showdowns in the Bay Area, with No. 3 UCLA also set to take on the Golden Bears and the Cardinal, could go a long way in deciding the eventual Pac-10 champion.
Senior goalie Kristin Olsen, who has six shutouts in seven games, looks to be on top of her game against the Bay Area teams. - Katelynn Whitaker|Daily Trojan
The Women of Troy (10-3, 2-0) have recorded shutouts in six of their last seven games and have ridden strong defensive play and timely saves from senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen to a tie atop the conference standings.

“I think we’re getting comfortable with each other,” Olsen said. “At the beginning of the season we had a lot of people injured and a lot of people switching in and out of the positions. Now we have a good comfortable back four and we’re able to produce more opportunities for our forwards.”
Olsen and the back four will have their hands full on Friday at 7 p.m. in Palo Alto, Calif., with the Cardinal’s dynamic attacking trio of forwards.
Senior forward Kelley O’Hara, a three-time All Pac-10 player, leads the conference with 15 goals on the season, including a hat trick in the Cardinal’s 5-1 romp over Oregon last Sunday.
Junior Christen Press is second in the Pac-10 with 12 goals and leads the conference with 10 assists while sophomore Lindsay Taylor, last year’s Pac-10 Freshman of the Year, has posted four goals and seven assists.
Stanford boasts the nation’s most prolific offense, averaging 3.7 goals per game, and hasn’t been shut out all season.
“I think it’s actually good for us,” junior midfielder Alyssa Dávila said of the test against Stanford. “We have nothing to lose so we can just go up there and play like we can.”
USC will then take on Cal (8-3-1, 2-0) on Sunday at 1 p.m. in Berkeley.
The Golden Bears got back on track last weekend with victories over Oregon and Oregon State, following a turbulent couple of weeks for the Cal women’s soccer program.
After Cal lost 1-0 to Sacramento State at home on Oct. 2, the Golden Bears’ second consecutive loss to an unranked opponent, a reportedly frustrated Neil McGuire resigned as head coach indefinitely.
His sudden announcement left Cal without its coach for their game two days later against Santa Clara, a contest they drew 1-1.
McGuire returned to the team the next day, citing personal reasons and apologizing for his conduct.
“I put myself ahead of our team,” McGuire said in a statement. “I need to be a better coach and mentor and will work towards this goal.”
Last weekend’s two wins seem to have stabilized the situation and Cal looks to be a major player in the conference championship race.
The Golden Bears are led by Alex Morgan, a junior forward that tops the team in both goals (10) and assists (4).
Facing two ranked teams and riding a nine game winning streak, the hype surrounding the USC women’s soccer team is as intense as it’s been all season.
“I don’t care about rankings…the streak, the record — to me that stuff is irrelevant,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said. “It’s just about improving. If we improve, the result will take care of itself.”

Celebrating its 25th anniversary, Cirque du Soleil returns Friday to the shores of Santa Monica, bringing with it more than just a circus under a paltry beach umbrella.
The “wheel of death,” on which acrobats perform stunts and tricks, is one of the most popular attractions in Kooza, Cirque du Soleil’s newest show that is currently running in Santa Monica, Calif. – Photo courtesy of Cirque du Soleil
The Quebec-based entertainment company, whose name means “circus of the sun,” presents its latest show, Kooza, which tells a story about a young boy whose adventures with a trickster puts him on a path of self-discovery.
“With Kooza, we wanted to give a little red thread, so that people can follow the character,” said Gilles Ste-Croix, co-founder of Cirque du Soleil. “The main character is meant to represent the child in each one of us [who] wants to discover the world [and] wants to go into this kingdom of imagination.”
Performed under the famed Grand Chapiteau, a massive tent measuring 165-feet in diameter and 82-feet high, Kooza relies on theatrical symbolism — created by props, body language and music — to reveal the evolution of an innocent character overcoming his fears.
“We built our show on evocation, and we built images that you can interpret the way you want,” Ste-Croix explained. “What you make out of it is really personal. Somebody beside you will see something else, [but that’s] not important, [because] we all have the same image to guide us.”
In celebration of the pier’s 100th birthday, the blue-and-yellow tent, also known as the “Big Top,” will be set up on the structure. The tent makes up one part of a mobile village, which takes more than 200 workers and 11 days to put together.
Unlike other Cirque du Soleil shows such as Ka, this low-tech production, which will run for six weeks, dazzles with high-level human performance and focuses on creating images with the body.
“It’s different, that’s all. You have to renew yourself. You have to be different,” Ste-Croix said. “The challenge of not using technology today is hard.”
The show takes traditional circus acts, including contortion, high-wire walking and even juggling, and transforms them into awe-inspiring physical triumphs to produce the magical ambiance Cirque du Soleil productions are known for.
“We create moments where it’s very slow and dynamic — sometimes it’s on the floor, sometimes it’s in the air. All this creates the skeleton, the aspect of where the performance is,” Ste-Croix said.
A “wheel of death,” included in one of the longer numbers, continues rolling while acrobats dressed like skeletons twirl and jump to stay aloft, as if laughing in the face of death.
But drawing upon fantastical acrobatic feats brings a certain level of danger.
“In this show… the public is so close to the stage. It’s like the wheel of death is on your knees. It’s right there, so it’s more scary,” Ste-Croix said.
Directed by David Shiner, a performer and clown himself, the show reflects Cirque du Soleil’s belief in nurturing talent from within.
Shiner, who performed in Nouvelle Expérience, began with the company in the 1990s. He’s noted for introducing interactive elements to his performances and incorporating humor into typical Cirque whimsy.
“[My job is to] gather these people together and create something from a white page. The mix of these people creates something very genuine, and Kooza is [one of] the great successes of that process,” said Ste-Croix.
A typical show takes a minimum of three years to produce, which infuses a new layer of dedication to the simple idea of running off and joining the circus.
“All the numbers you see out there, you have to find them,” Ste-Croix said. “They are not at the supermarket.”
Ste-Croix, who began his career as an apple-picker-turned-stilt walker, founded Cirque du Soleil with Guy Laliberté in 1984, combining jaw-dropping acrobatics with the art of theater.
As creative director, he is the mastermind behind shows such as O, Alegría and Mystère.
With more than 19 different shows running simultaneously around the world, Ste-Croix has his plate full.
“I make a very good living,” said Ste-Croix. “I create things.”
As the first location in the United States where Cirque du Soleil performed, Santa Monica holds a sentimental value and conjures up memories of simpler times.
“It’s a moment when Americans first discovered Cirque du Soleil, and made it a success for us,” Ste-Croix said.
From a humble group of 20 performers in 1984, Cirque du Soleil has transformed into a company employing more than 4,000 people from 40 different countries.
“[I love] always having a new exciting project. All kinds of new creators come and work for us, bring their creativity and create some fantastic new things,” Ste-Croix said. “That’s what keeps me alive.”

Saying this won’t halt any productions, but I wish Hollywood would stop co-opting my childhood to turn a profit.
Coming soon to a theater near you is a slate of board game and action figure-based movies inspired by the success of Transformers and G.I. Joe — which if you haven’t heard about, gaze ye upon the Variety archives and despair.
Somewhere in between the Seuss adaptations, Disney’s mindless sequels to its animated classics and a Peter Berg-directed version of Battleship is Spike Jonze’s Where the Wild Things Are. Opening Friday, the long-awaited adaptation of Maurice Sendak’s beloved 1963 classic is certainly the most interesting reappropriation of children’s popular culture by Hollywood.
Much has been made of the length of Sendak’s original story — a mere 10 sentences — and rightfully so. There isn’t strong precedent to show that stories such as Where the Wild Things Are — wonderful as short, colorful representations of childhood fantasies and realities — can work in any capacity as features.
For example, recall Ron Howard’s very mainstream and uninspired 2000 adaption of Dr. Seuss’ How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Going even further down an ignominious list brings us to first-time film director Bo Welch’s particularly terrible version of Seuss’ The Cat in the Hat.
For all the failings of those films, their main flaw is at the screenplay level. Very few writers could overcome the challenge of expanding a simple story without bloating it. Part of the reason why the 1966 animated version of Grinch sits on a completely different level of quality than Howard’s overstuffed Christmas epic — other than the legendary Boris Karloff narration — is the simple reason that a 30-minute adaptation simply works better than a feature-length film.
It’s easy to mock the aforementioned Welch for making an awful film, but he was essentially a great production designer out of his element as director of a story not really meant for feature adaptation. He and Spike Jonze have at least the production design background in common, and Jonze’s films and music videos have all been marked by truly inspired art direction.
In fact, the art direction is the vortex around which the buzz for Where The Wild Things Are is swirling; people seem more enamored with the trailer’s visuals than of where Jonze is taking the story itself. To Jonze’s credit, the film’s look is truly exceptional and, rather than any forced nostalgia for Sendak’s story, is what initially drew my attention. It certainly looks a world better than the awkward stop-motion of Wes Anderson’s upcoming adaptation of The Fantastic Mr. Fox by Roald Dahl — my favorite children’s author.
Though Jonze might be a visual master, he’s untested as a screenwriter and, inevitably, no longer has the talented Charlie Kaufman to lean on. Co-writer Dave Eggers has a surer résumé as a writer, but his list of screenwriting credits is just as short as Jonze’s. The film’s well-publicized and seemingly unending production woes are also a cause for concern.
The problems with Where the Wild Things Are stem from a far deeper place than any issues behind its production. Even if the movie is great — which it could very well be — there is something sinister about the particular way Hollywood produced and is now marketing the film. What burns me about this particular strip-mining job on our collective childhoods is the way that Hollywood has infused the film and the marketing campaign with a certain hip indie sensibility.
It seems as though the focus of the marketing for the film, particularly the instant-classic trailer, is Jonze rather than the Wild Things; the hip, talented filmmaker rather than the legendary story itself — which is being ripped apart anyway to be rebuilt as a nearly two-hour film.
After all, what Wild Things-loving kid is going to care an ounce that the film was directed by the genius behind Being John Malkovich and Adaptation? What child is going to recognize the great indie anthem of “Wake Up” by The Arcade Fire that lends the images of the trailer such power?
At least Transformers and G.I. Joe — terrible though they are — don’t carry the stuffy air of a children’s story being marketed as an indie art film. And at least those upcoming board game and action figure movies are co-opting a part of my childhood that didn’t leave any lasting emotional impact.
Especially because it is culled from a book I loved in a way that feels hollow and unnecessary, Jonze’s film doesn’t excite the child in me nearly to the degree that Up or Ponyo did, or that The Princess and the Frog or Toy Story 3 are just beginning to.
But as one of the great visual artists of his generation, every film Jonze makes is worth seeing, even if it is just to see what he does and doesn’t do.
I’m actually glad my expectations have been brought low by early reviews and the confused tantrums of my inner child. I’ll just make sure I don’t see it in a corporate multiplex — I certainly wouldn’t want to lose my indie cred.

I live for college football Saturdays.
It’s during those 14 Saturdays, when the 90-degree heat gives way to the 30-degree snow (at least in my hometown of Chicago), that life is as beautiful as the Italian opera singers in The Shawshank Redemption. Like the prisoners, I stop and soak it all in.
But there is one thing that prevents the opera singers from turning into Beyoncé. One thing that I hope I wake up late enough to miss. One thing that I actually might mute the TV for.
That is Lou Holtz.
Before I go any further, let me say this: I think Holtz was a heck of a coach and motivator. He’s the only coach to guide six different schools to season-ending bowl games. He won a national title at Notre Dame and was named coach of the year in 1988. In his last stint, he took control of the reigns of an 0-11 South Carolina team and steered it to a New Year’s Day bowl two years later.
Since his retirement from coaching, the 72-year-old Holtz has been a college football analyst for ESPN. He appears during weekly segments and on College GameDay Saturday mornings, and occasionally serves as an analyst for a game, like he did for Wednesday’s Boise State vs. Tulsa game.
It was while I was watching this game and clips of his previews for this weekend’s Notre Dame-USC game that I decided he has to go.
I respect Holtz’s enthusiasm and commitment to college football, but it’s almost unbearable watching him every week. His mouth works faster than his mind. He says things that make my jaw drop.
About a year ago, Holtz likened Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez to the Fürher himself. When talking about leadership qualities, Holtz inexplicably said, “You know, Hitler was a great leader too.”
His co-analysts looked stunned, and Rece Davis tried to cover up by saying, “You mean Hitler was a bad leader?” Holtz replied, “Yes,” but the damage was done. Needless to say, ESPN was apologizing from the summit of Mount Everest the next day.
This hasn’t been Holtz’s only misstep, not by far. In fact, I was reminded of this while watching the Boise State game Wednesday, as Holtz made another testy analogy when a Tulsa coach received a penalty: “There’s also a rule that you can’t bring a little play gun into school, and they are going to put you in prison for it because it’s against the rules.”
Really, Lou? A gun and school reference? He could’ve made a reference to being late for class three times and given a detention, but he made a gun and school reference during a period when those are the last two things people want to hear in the same sentence.
But the final straw for me occurred after Davis promoted ESPNChicago.com during the telecast. After the promotion, Holtz said, “I do things for ESPNChicago everyday on Notre Dame, completely impartial and unbiased.”
For those of you who watch Holtz, I’ll let that sink in for a second.
Holtz loves Notre Dame, as he should. But as an analyst and journalist, he lets this get in the way of his reporting and too many times has he shown bias to Notre Dame. In fact, he picked them to go to the national championship game at the beginning of the season when most people didn’t even have them in the top 25.
Then, in his previews for this week’s USC-Notre Dame game, he spoke of the Irish as if they were the best team in the country. If I was visiting from Myanmar and had no idea about college football, I would think that Notre Dame is unbeatable, whereas in reality, it could very well be 1-4.
There was one comment in particular that Holtz made that almost made me throw a baseball at my TV.
“Of course, we don’t know how Matt Barkley is going to react in a hostile environment such as Notre Dame.”
Excuse me? Barkley led the game-winning drive in front of one of the largest and most hostile crowds in the country in only his second start. He also went to Cal and threw two touchdown passes — all while the student section was throwing everything at him except a Zinedine Zidane head-butt. I’m pretty sure we all know how he’s going to react.
He might have said a few other things, yet those above are the sentences that I understood — he sounds like he has marbles in his mouth.
I’m not judging Holtz’s character or debating whether he’s a nice guy. But he’s definitely not suitable to be on the air, especially on ESPN. With him gone, my college football Saturdays would be perfect.

On that account, my partner Mark May should be fired for his blatant bias against ND and for Pitt…
Amen. Even a so-so dye job and new teeth (hence the spitting) can’t help Lou. He needs to go…
Finally an article I can rant on and on about.  I won’t however, because it’s pretty well summarized above.  Lou Holtz – GOODBYE!!!
Hey Lou,
You can afford dental implants; buy some.
I’m pretty sure he spit through the tv at me last week.
YES! He has marbles in his mouth and mush in his brain! Hey Lou, fix your dentures and go cry on a beach with Ara. I was at the 55 – 24 beating, Ara retired right afterwards!! Loved, loved it!!  FIGHT ON!
During the Boise State game this past Wednesday and on College Football Live, Coach Holtz stated two things that were contradictory.
1.  If all the Top 10 teams are a one loss team, the team that deserves to go to the National Championship is USC.
2.  Notre Dame will beat USC this Saturday.
And I heard this while Holtz’s dentrues were slipping as he talked.
Look folks, he’s a character for sure, and he brings in ratings, so that’s why he’s still on TV as a sports analyst.  Notre Dame has perhaps the largest alumni and fan following off all college sports, so he’ll be around for a while.  ND fans love Lou Holtz, no matter what he says and how he says it……..   thought, personally, I think he should retire and live on a beach somewhere…
Go Trojans…..
Sta Fight On 13!
Beat Notre Dame.
Good article Kenny. I agree that Holtz is an abomination and should have been fired years ago. He is completely unqualified to work on television. And Barkley didn’t throw two touchdowns against Cal.
Lou Holtz should not be in national broadcasting due to his blatant bias in favor of Notre Dame, as well as openly rooting for or against teams, as was evident when he donned his Ohio St coaching gear prior to the USC @ Ohio St game. However do not be fooled by this seemingly senile old man, he is still as shrewed as ever. This seasons proclamations about Notre Dame’s return to national power, about Clawson’s bid for the Heisman, about the depth of talent, and the advantage of Coach Weis calling plays this season, has set the bar so high  that he is ensuring that blame for a poor season falls on the shoulders of Coach Weis and gets him fired.
Lou Holtz does indeed need to fade into the woodwork.  He adds a spark to the show on occasion, but that is not a common happening.  Sorry, Lou, it’s time to retire–your reign at Notre Dame will never be forgotten.
Thank you.
If someone could invent a muting system that automatically would eliminate Lou Holtz’s voice the minute he started to speak, they’d be a millionaire.
Holtz is a complete jerk.
Lou Holtz should have been fired years ago.  He is an embarrassment.

Growing up in largely Latino Southern Arizona directly exposed me to how a large portion of the population deals with their health care needs — they drive for 45 minutes down to south of the border to take advantage of less expensive health care and pharmaceuticals.
Andrew Laskowski|Daily Trojan
Has American health care become so expensive that we have to outsource medical care, too?
A recent study conducted by the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research found that an estimated 1 million Californians seek medical, dental or prescription coverage in Mexico each year.
The fact that 46.3 million people remain uninsured is a clear sign that the current system isn’t beneficial to everyone. Working a low-income job with limited or no health benefits doesn’t suddenly diminish a person’s health care needs, nor does it lower the cost. Doctors across the border understand this and capitalize on the medical visits to Mexico.
Interestingly enough, Latino US citizens account for only half of the citizens traveling across the border for health care, which costs roughly a little less than half of what it would cost in the United States without insurance. The trip south is suddenly a little less inconvenient when parents can pay $2,400 for their children’s braces as opposed to the minimum $5,000 it would cost in the US.
The incentive to travel south rises when considering that 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies in 2007 were caused by health problems. Shockingly, 71 percent of those that filed for bankruptcy were covered.
Steps were taken on Tuesday when congressional committees endorsed a bill for health care reform. The legislation, which faces major hurdles before it will hit the Senate floor for debate by the end of the month, looks to expand Medicaid and federal subsidies for lower-income families, as well as keep a harsher tab on insurance companies.
Legislation is far from complete, and only one member of the GOP, Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe, currently endorses the bill. It may be a while before many Americans can find affordable coverage above the border.
Border-hopping for treatment carries its fair share of risks. Primarily, there’s a lack of access to malpractice insurance coverage. If a procedure goes wrong, liability could go out the window.
These concerns are enough to keep most Americans away from Mexico for their health care needs, but, when push comes to shove, people are more prone to take the only risk they can afford. A $21,000 heart bypass is certainly more accessible than the up to $144,000 it can cost in the United States.
Price disparities don’t need to be so high. Japan, which has the highest life expectancy in the world, pays $2,581 annually per person; the United States pays a staggering $7,290 with a life expectancy that only ranks 42nd internationally.
The fact remains that citizens shouldn’t have to foreclose on their homes to pay for surgery, or else go across the border to get it. Yet conservatives still cry that letting the government take over health care gives them that much more power over citizens, as demonstrated by the paltry support for the comprehensive reform.
Instead of giving the power to a $2.3-trillion industry run by insurance companies that can discriminate against anyone with preexisting health conditions, the government can and should step in. And they’re trying to.
For those that disagree with the platform of extended health care, take a walk in the shoes of the 15.4 percent of Americans without health insurance. That’s entering a pool where 45,000 will die annually because they are uninsured — one needless death every 12 minutes.
Citizens should not have to put up with this discrepancy. It’s the people in these situations that Obama set out to help, and it’s these people who are going to suffer if the health care reform doesn’t pass.
Lobbyists for the insurance industry, however, are making their best efforts to stop it, out of fear for lost profits. They strategically released a report one day before a critical senate vote on the matter, arguing the plan could cost families $4,000 more than expected in 2019.
Lobbyists neglected to mention that, with premiums rising at three times the rate of wages, families can expect to pay $24,000 per year by 2016 under the system currently in place.
The government is hardly criticized for building roads or funding schools, but, for some reason, trying to give everyone reasonable health care coverage is out of line. Isn’t our health, though, more important than anything else? It’s not as if people are advocating socialism, increased government size or rampant debt — yet many are treating the situation that way.
Fortunately, Southern Californians don’t have to worry about this dilemma because people here have access to affordable health care already. They just have to go to Mexico to get it.

Fragoza’s article is almost astonishingly simple-minded. The biggest reason for astronomical medical costs in the U.S. is out-of-control tort lawyers (think: John Edwards). What’s more, getting the government completely OUT of the medical business is what would truly force insurance companies to compete for customers on a broad base which would force them to cater to markets now not served. It’s really pretty simple, would cost virtually nothing, and has not been tried. Why are liberals so damn afraid to give THAT a shot? Because they’re all about grabbing more power and control, some would argue. It has nothing to do with “change” as the dimwitted Mr. Degan mentions, above. It’s about doing something that will actually work. And PS — the U.S. CANNOT AFFORD the medical care plan Obama is pushing. Hello? Talk about mass stupidity.
The United States bosts the most complicated health care system in the world. We have every option available. Our states offer free care, subsidized care, and expensive care. Our employers offer free care, subsidized care, and expensive care. We have free clinics, subsidized clinics and expensive clinics. We have insurance companies that offer health plans allowed by law in many price ranges.
We have so many choices that our lawmakers want to get rid of most of them.
Our lawmakers could make great strides in simplifying the health care system by unbundeling it form the tax system. Instead of giving companies and unions tax breaks for whatever they give to employees, they could tax it like income. Companies and unions would soon find that it is cheaper to let individuals shop for the plan that suits them best rather than the companies and unions shopping for the cheapest plan for their bottom line.
My younger brother Jeff is the shame of the Degan family. He not only lives in France, he actually likes it there. He has a French wife and two gorgeous little French daughters. Honestly I think the guy is a closet commie. Back in August, in a letter to his fellow countrymen and women regarding health care – or “Hell Care” as he called it (What a card!) – he ended it by saying:
“In short, in the US, you pay more, get less, and die younger than we do in Europe. What part of that don’t you understand?”
Well, hey there! That’s a danged good question! What part of that don’t we understand? Why is it that so many of us have to be dragged, kicking and screaming like half-witted little preschoolers, into the brave new world of change? What the hell is the matter with us anyway? How can it be that such a huge number of Americans cheerfully join movements of mass stupidity and salivate on cue to the sound of Dr. Glenn “Pavlov” Beck’s bell? It kind of makes you wonder, huh?

To whom much is given, much is expected.” And President Barack Obama is no exception to the rule. After the Norwegian Nobel Committee honored the President with the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize last week for what it termed “his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples,” pundits are still abuzz.
On Friday, Rush Limbaugh, in typical fashion, proclaimed “he doesn’t deserve the award.”
But the committee chair responded to naysayers Tuesday saying, “Alfred Nobel wrote that the prize should go to the person who has contributed most to the development of peace in the previous year … Who has done more for that than Barack Obama?”
Former President Jimmy Carter, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002, also defended the committee’s decision yesterday, saying “Obama deserves it as much as anyone who’s ever gotten it for his achievement already … If you talk to almost any person in a foreign country, they would tell you their own particular hopes and dreams and aspirations for the future have been enhanced by the vision that Obama has put forward.”
It seems that in an attempt to promote something positive, this award may have actually done Obama a disservice by raising expectations and giving his opponents ammunition to fire if his policies fall short.
Only nine months into his first term, Obama can already add his name to the list of distinguished figures like Elie Wiesel, Al Gore, Mother Teresa, the 14th Dalai Lama and Nelson Mandela, who have all won the Nobel Peace Prize. But Conservatives have relentlessly bashed Obama, claiming that he has done nothing to deserve the prestigious award that even Ghandi couldn’t achieve in a lifetime.
President Obama graciously responded to critics by saying, “I will accept this award as a call to action, a call for all nations and all peoples to confront the common challenges of the 21st century.”
Obama is only the third sitting US president to have earned this award; Woodrow Wilson won in 1919 and Theodore Roosevelt won in 1906.
Although the Nobel Peace Prize may be premature for a president who was nominated less than two weeks after taking office and has yet to end two violent wars overseas, we cannot overlook the accomplishments that Obama has achieved thus far (unless of course your name is Rush Limbaugh).
Obama has made significant headway toward repairing the United US-Russia relationship that the Bush administration demolished. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev wrote in the Washington Post that “relations soured because of the previous U.S. administration’s plans,” but Obama has initiated the necessary steps to work with Russia, though a lot of work still remains.
Obama has also improved relations with Iran; set a timetable for exiting Iraq that even the Iraqi prime minister has praised; issued an executive order to close the US military prison in Guantanamo Bay; and served as the first US president chair of the United Nations Security Council where he led a resolution to globally advance non-proliferation and disarmament.
But more than adding to this laundry list of tasks, he has also lifted the soured image of the United States around the globe and restored pride to our nation.
It’s obvious that Obama is working hard to promote peace and also improve life domestically for Americans; these changes cannot be expected overnight because we did not get into these situations overnight. Improved international relationships, ending an eight-year war in Afghanistan and a six-year war in Iraq, and improving the US economy will take time.
Obama still has much to do, and receiving the Nobel Peace Prize raised already high expectations to ridiculous heights. Now it is up to Obama and his staff to manage these expectations on the world stage; it is also up to us to be realistic about what we expect from Obama when he has inherited years of problems from the Bush administration.
While many hope that the high-profile nature of the award will bolster Obama’s position in the healthcare reform debate, it will also make his position regarding Afghanistan more difficult at a time when his administration is reassessing their strategy in this “war of necessity” and considering sending in more ground troops.
How does a Peace Prize recipient send additional troops into Afghanistan? Or does he? Only time will tell. Until then — despite the volley of criticism from Rush Limbaugh and other skeptics — we wait, hope and continue to support our president. After all, change is an ongoing process.

The NFL decides who becomes an owner not the other way around.
All this blowhard (Rush Hudson Limbaugh A.KA. Jeff Christie) has to offer is his money and his opinions, (which in my opinion are on the fringes of racism, one mans opinion). There are many more groups biding for the Rams, not just his group. Lets face it there are more men with money (Marshall Faulk) that will gladly fill the slot and the Rams will win or lose depending on how well they work as a team and not on whether or not Rush is an owner.
As for Vick, well he is a player (he has talent not like you, Rush or I, unless you are a NFL player?) and he served his time and the NFL decided we live in the land of second chances, so why not (I personally don’t like it but, oh well). Life has never been fair (NEWS FLASH!)
Now as to the “Free Speech” argument, I guess many of you like myself heard Rush on Thursday “Almost in tears”, priceless. But the last couple of days he now is in his normal ranting and will continue until someone surpasses him, “Free Speech” continues, so what is being stifled, it simply is not true, of course, you may not have a radio, so you might want to get one.

PS – I am sure someone is working to put the tapes together maybe all you subscribers can help, since you are all about getting to the truth?
PPS- Beauty Pageant Judge – Now I understand why he lost the weight, to find a new wife, creepy.
What a lot of ignorance and rot from the commenters, and what a load of nonsense from Nina Tyler. Nina, do you read anything other than the Daily Trojan? Because “pundits” from across the political spectrum, and across many international borders, all criticized this award. Rush Limbaugh is the best you can do? Do your homework before you spout opinions based on nothing but kneejerk liberal dogma.
Jack–uh, I sincerely hope you’re not a student here because that does not speak well for the university. What does Islamic oppression toward women have to do with conservatives in this country? And Reagan did end the Cold War pal. Ever read any history?
As for our littel friend Paul… ditto on the “I certainly hope you’re not a student here” sentiment, if only because you seem unable to put together a sentence without some type of grammatical error. And here’s a news flash for you buddy — your “prejudices” are EXACTLY the same level of “putridness” as Rush Limbaugh’s. Some people call them opinions, but I know you lefties like to demonize people with whom you disagree. Pathetic.
It seems to me that all the negative vibes this blowhard (Rush Hudson Limbaugh A.KA. Jeff Christie) has been spewing over these many years has come back to blow back on his face (A classic “Blow Back”).  He always tries to give off the airs that he can have anything he wants but as we all witness those with more money and more influence tossed him aside like sack of potatoes and the ultimate insult was that it was done in public (money don’t buy you everything butterball).
Now of course he blames everyone else (Michael J. Fox, Perez Hilton, Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Sonia Sotomayor, Hillary Clinton, Olympia Snowe, ESPN, NFL, the media, basically people of color, the handicapped, women and gays) when of course all you have to do is listen to his show and plainly hear his daily prejudices filled sermons. So NFL, I salute you decision, job well done. And to the whaling cry baby perched on his self made pedestal, quit your whining it was your own fault. Don’t we all feel better?
You really are deluded if you think Reagan ended the Cold War. His ridiculous defense spending and politics helped create the Iraq War, not to mention the shooting of the Iranian civilian airliner and the countless Iranians killed and gassed by Iraqis, all with convenient U.S. funding. Or perhaps Reagan should have been awarded the Peace Prize for funding the Contras in South America.
Yes and Afghani villagers are being bombed routinely by U.S. predator drones. We have “liberated” them from their oppression as we have limited the oppressed in the Occupied Territories and in pro-Western countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the latter in which women are not allowed to drive.
I didn’t think this kind of putrid conservatism was still in fashion but I guess I have a lot to learn.
Peace Prizes are not awarded based upon future promise but on passed accomplishments and have been for every other Peace Prize awarded.  The Nobel Selection Committee was initially 3-2 AGAINST and was arm twisted into decision by their Chairman Thorbjoern Jagland.
Think for a moment about the peoples of central Europe that were liberated by the dissolution of the Soviet Union.  The conservative drive of Ronald Reagan delivered peace to a region that had been trampled down for centuries between Austrian-Hungarian, Nazi Germany and Soviet Russian occupations.  No Nobel prize for that accomplishment was ever awarded and I don’t think you will find a ranking conservative that has been awarded by this liberal European organization.
Schools are being built in Afghanistan and women can at least come out of their homes without fear of perscution by the medieval Taliban.
We can only hope progress with Iran.  This is a terrible government and Christian based countries cannot afford to be hoodwinked…  The life of Israel and stability in the region is in the balance.
This prize was awarded because Obama had simply been elected and had campaigned on a platform that the Nobel Committee supports (and to acknowledge the hate for Bushie… ). Bush didn’t run for popularity in Europe, he ran to protect the interests of the United States.  With respect to the wars, have any of the Euros stepped up their commitment to a war on terror? No. WW2 happened because of appeasement and the USA had to come in and clean up the mess.  We are cleaning up the Al Qaeda mess worldwide and the Euros are going to be the major benefactors.
Obama has a lot to do to earn this award, let us hope the history books written in a generation are able to confirm the decision on the award and not ridicule it.

As most of us have been pulling our hair out studying for midterms, now is probably not the best time for us to imagine being rock stars. In fact, some would consider being a performing musician and full-time student almost impossible.
Not if you’re Mike Posner.
The singer and Duke University student is the collegiate version of a superhero, spending weekdays in class and weekends performing. He keeps his grades up — he’s got a 3.6 GPA — and his music loud, constantly roaming the United States rocking new venues. As a sociology major and business minor at one of the country’s best schools, it is a wonder Posner ever sleeps.

“The weekend before finals last spring I had two shows,” the musician recalled. “Then I had a bunch of meetings that Monday, three finals on Tuesday, a show Wednesday, recorded a song with Wale on Thursday and flew to New York to meet Jay-Z on Friday.”
Posner’s career stems back to his former employment at a Detroit radio station where he met collaborator and mentor Big Sean. He wrote songs for the artist and fellow college students, but ultimately decided he was best suited to sing his own lyrics. Posner, who had never sung before his junior year in college, has seen much success since the release of his first mixtape in February, reaching heights his fellow students never could have imagined.
“On my 21st birthday this year, I went to the studio,” Posner said. “This was before anything had really taken off, and my friends all made fun of me. I just said, ‘You’ll see.’”
Posner’s confidence is by no means cockiness — he is modest and, above all, thankful for the position he’s in. He has managed to bridge the gap between pop and hip-hop in a way top 40’s biggest haters would appreciate. A Matter of Time, Posner’s current mixtape, is full of gems. The singer’s raspy voice croons catchy choruses over piano melodies and smooth beats.
Posner and his band, The Brain Trust, keep the album interesting with their remixes. When applying the term remix to Posner and his crew, it could mean a version of Beyoncé’s “Halo” sung by the student himself, or other types of homage to classics — you probably haven’t heard anything like the hip-hop twist Posner puts on songs like Donnie Darko’s “Mad World” and Electric Light Orchestra’s “Evil Woman.”
Posner’s mixtape was also free on iTunes U for most of this summer. (His label recently took it down, but he is working on getting it back up.)
“There will be a CD out in the first or second quarter of next year that you can pay for, and I saved all my really awesome songs for that,” he joked.
Posner’s current material is so fresh that it’s hard to believe he’s been holding out. Album highlights are “Cooler Than Me,” which features Big Sean, and “Drug Dealer Girl,” an ode to a pot-dealing female.
“My mom is not a fan at all,” Posner said of his tune’s marijuana mentions. He also explained that while most of his professors give him general career support, a few think his decision to sing proudly about drug pushers is a bit misguided.
“My reply is that I don’t make exclusive music or overly political music by any means, but I make fun and inclusive music,” Posner said. “At my shows, you’ll see boys, girls, black people, white people, rich people and poor people, all smiling and having fun at the same time. That’s where the power of my music lies.”
Posner has seen diverse crowds on his tours across America, which have taken him from Daytona Beach, Fla. to New Haven, Conn. While Posner’s job requires him to jetset across the nation, his roommates live the typical lives of college students, throwing house parties and making ramen.
“Every time I come back from a weekend of shows, there’s like beer cans and sticky floors,” Posner said. “Its like, ‘I can tell you guys had a good time this weekend!’”
Posner has sacrificed a lot of his college experience for his career, but he doesn’t regret a moment of it.
“I’m living the dream, and I love what I’m doing,” he said. “To get where you want to be in anything, you have to take opportunities when they’re presented.”
Somehow, Posner has managed to take advantage of it all, from his career as a musician to his senior year at Duke University. He has even created a webisode series (aptly titled One Foot Out The Door) to portray his life as a multitasker.
His career has come a long way since his first mixtape dropped seven months ago, and Posner has nothing but high hopes for the future.
“If my career was a basketball season, I’ve played just two preseason games,” he said. “I’ve only just begun.”
he’s playing tonight at Phi Psi 500 concert!
