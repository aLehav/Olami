The Undergraduate Student Government incorporated the Middle Eastern and North African Student Association as an assembly, allowing them to serve as an umbrella organization and providing them access to USG funding to distribute among its member organizations, at Tuesday night’s Senate meeting. 
MENASA is a cultural assembly that recognizes MENA students on campus and advocates for MENA accommodations. MENASA has been trying to attain establishment as an assembly since 2019.
Chief programming officer Jillian Fallon and president Hannah Woodworth announced amendments to the incorporation process of assemblies and committees. Assemblies and committees were previously given a trial period of eight weeks, but with the new amendment, their trial period will last until the end of the semester. The Senate unanimously voted to approve the extension. 
The Military Associated Student Assembly will have its trial period retroactively extended to Dec. 2. Once the trial period ends, the assembly or committee will be incorporated with a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. 
The Senate also unanimously voted to designate the Transfer Student Assembly as a cultural assembly. The assembly works to create a platform to advocate for and raise awareness of transfer student issues on campus, allowing students to have a smooth integration into the USC community.
“Transfer students experience quite a bit of culture shock,” said chief diversity officer Zaid Diaz-Arias. “They’re entering this institution and must acclimate to the differences in classes, campus size and academic rigor. So, given the wide array of challenges facing transfer students … it is absolutely vital for students to have an advocate space and be represented within the advocacy department.”
Senator Sam Habibi updated the Senate on his projects, including his work with MENASA to meet with the United States Office of Management and Budget to try to create a coalition across the University, in addition to establishing a separate category for those who identify as Middle Eastern or North African. 
Another project Habibi has worked on is RestSC, which will provide nap pods on campus for students. Habibi said that the project will help with something he’s personally struggling with amid midterm season: a lack of sleep.
“Yesterday, I was at the library until 3 a.m. and I didn’t get enough sleep,” Habibi said. “There was no place to sleep and no place to rest, so I wished that we had this.” 
Habibi will visit UCLA, which already established nap pods, to gain a better understanding of the costs and placement of the pods.
Woodworth discussed the launch of SCÜP, a shuttle service taking students from USC to the Los Angeles International Airport, which will be running Wednesday and Thursday. SCÜP will be running ahead of every academic break, beginning with this week’s Fall Recess, and will be available before Thanksgiving Holiday and Winter Recess.
“SCÜP is an initiative funded by USG to help alleviate the stress of what should be a stress-free journey back home,” Director of public relations Mustafa Ali Khan said.

USC Student Health and USC Pharmacies launched “Vaxchella,” a walk-in event for students, faculty and staff to receive the updated flu vaccine and bivalent coronavirus booster Monday. The University will host the event on the first floor of Engemann Student Health Center through Oct. 21. In a Tuesday briefing with the Daily Trojan, Chief Student Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said she hoped the event would provide convenience for community members looking to get vaccinated.
“[For] a lot of people, it is convenient to go to a pharmacy,” Van Orman said. “But for a lot of people, it’s just way more convenient to get it at work.”
The event comes with other weekly flu shot events hosted by Student Health — on Wednesdays at the weekly Trojan Farmers Market and on Tuesdays at the USC Village — in an effort to encourage the community to get the updated vaccines. Van Orman said that while such an effort is “not unusual” and has historically existed, it remains important in lieu of a mandate, which Student Health imposed last year but not this year.
“When we don’t have a mandate for a vaccine — particularly for students who are otherwise young and healthy and don’t really understand why it’s important to get a flu shot — we just try to create a variety of opportunities for people to get flu shots,” Van Orman said. “This [event], though, also serves faculty and staff, and that’s why we’re partnering with the Pharmacies, because … we knew a lot of employees really wanted an opportunity to get their flu shot.”
In regards to influenza vaccination rates in recent years, Van Orman said that last year’s mandate and 2020 being a “strange year” made it difficult to “say too much about trends.” Since 2020, Student Health has been able to access data from the California Immunization Registry, a statewide digital immunization information system for California residents managed by the California Department of Public Health. However, Van Orman said, “tThis is the first year we’ll have a complete picture.”
“In normal years, we give about 4,000 to 5,000 flu shots here at Student Health,” Van Orman said. “If we look at CDC data, [national estimates are that] maybe 10% to 15% of young adults between 18 to 24 get their flu shot. … We know people got their flu shot last year, so we’re trying to really use that as a way to help people stay in the habit of getting their flu shot, even if it’s not required.”
Van Orman said the goal for the event is to administer 1,000 to 2,000 flu shots and coronavirus boosters to students, faculty and staff. In combination with Student Health’s other events and general appointments, the cumulative goal is to administer 10,000 flu shots — just under 15% of the total USC population, based on counts from the 2021-2022 academic year.
Influenza cases are so far appearing “sporadically” at local and national levels, Van Orman said. While exact numbers are not tracked, cases reported to Student Health in the past week are estimated at “less than a dozen.” Student Health instead reports influenza cases as a percentage of respiratory samples that test positive for influenza and a percentage of  patients who visit for influenza-like illness. The method is in accordance with the CDC’s own practices for FluView, the agency’s weekly influenza surveillance report.
“So there’s a baseline of one or two percent,” Van Orman said. “If you get over around three or four percent of visits of ILI, that actually means that you’re starting to see influenza activity in your community.”
Coronavirus cases are continuing to decrease: Student Health received reports of 82 positive tests the week beginning Oct. 2, an 11% decrease from the 91 cases reported the week before.
With the inaugural Sex Week at USC set to begin next Monday, the lineup of events is mostly finalized with a few more “waiting in the wings,” said Rachel Lichtman, associate director of public communications at Student Health, during the briefing. Recognized student organizations are still encouraged to add any last-minute events.

USC alumni Ashlea Tate and Arash Markazi met briefly in the Daily Trojan newsroom as Sports staff writers. Twenty years later, they’re engaged. 
After matching on a dating app during the coronavirus pandemic, Tate and Markazi went out on their first date — a fancy WeHo dinner at Cecconi’s. In talking, they realized their time at USC overlapped, and Markazi asked Tate whether she’d participated in extracurriculars at the University. Tate told him what she thought he knew all along: they’d crossed paths in the newsroom in the spring of 2001. 
“My heart dropped because I was so nervous that she was just going to up and leave the table or be insulted, but she laughed,” Markazi said. “She thought I was going to make up for lost time, and I had no idea.”
After a year of dating, Markazi asked for Tate’s hand in marriage — she said “yes.” Their LinkedIn engagement post included photos of the only Daily Trojan print paper Markazi saved from his college days: incidentally, a story of his was on the front page, and one of Tate’s was on the back. 
At the paper, Tate covered water polo, golf and, sometimes, feature stories; her favorite story, she said, was one she wrote about the newly-opened Krispy Kreme at Café 84. Markazi wrote about the men’s basketball team, which made it to the Elite Eight at the time. The years he attended USC happened to be incredibly significant for college sports — Markazi’s first day on campus, in fact, was former football coach Pete Carroll’s first day on the job. 
Though they worked on the same staff, Tate and Markazi only crossed paths once, in passing. Tate remembers seeing Markazi for the first time as he walked into the newsroom — the same room in the Student Union where the paper is produced to this day. 
“We were doing different beats, so that was my first time ever seeing him, and I thought, ‘Oh wow, he’s really attractive,’” Tate said. “We never really interacted because he was there for a meeting, and I was there with our sports editors, so we never really had any chance to meet.”
Markazi saved the one print copy of the paper he has today because one of his stories made the front page in the News section: He’d been called to cover a guest speech from then-chief executive of AOL Time Warner Gerald Levine on the “role of the Internet” because no news writers were available. Tate’s back-page story was on the women’s water polo team competing at the Long Beach State tournament. 
After Tate and Markazi graduated from USC in 2002 and 2004, respectively, their careers and lives didn’t cross again until they met on Hinge. Markazi moved to New York for a time and worked for Sports Illustrated Magazine, ESPN and the Los Angeles Times before starting his own sports media outlet, The Sporting Tribune, which covers Southern California, Hawaii and Las Vegas. 
Tate attended graduate school at Cal State Northridge and scored a public relations internship at Los Angeles International Airport around the same time. She’s been in the travel and tourism industry ever since, having worked at the Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board, Cirque du Soleil and Madame Tussauds. She currently serves as the brand marketing manager at the West Hollywood Travel + Tourism Board, and said her time at the Daily Trojan urged her to pursue writing and communications. 
“I’m really grateful for my time at the Daily Trojan because, when I first started at USC, I went in as undecided because I wanted to be open to different majors and different industries,” Tate said. “[The paper] really sparked my interest in writing and that’s when I knew I wanted to do print journalism.”
Markazi said finding his “future person” at USC had been a dream of his — as is it for many others who envision experiencing the quintessential collegiate romance — but it hadn’t panned out quite as he’d expected.
“I was so married to my job and my career and where I wanted it to go,” Markazi said. “I’ve often felt like, ‘What if [Tate and I] went out or something [back then]?’ But I don’t think it would have been what it is. I wouldn’t have appreciated what I have now.”
Markazi enjoys maintaining his relationship with the University. Since graduating, he taught at USC as an adjunct professor for four years. His class, “Sports Commentary” ran several semesters ago as a practicum in field reporting on sports games. 
Markazi proposed to Tate on a trip to Las Vegas to close on a condo they’d bought together. One of Tate’s closest friends, Nicole Steen, saw her and Markazi grow closer after first meeting, and said she was “so excited” about their engagement.
“I knew they were going to get engaged — I just didn’t know when,” said Steen, who was a featured majorette on the USC Marching Band and who currently works as a celebrity fitness trainer. “I just was wondering, you know, ‘When is this going to happen?’ You guys are wired together all the time. You travel the world together. And then, it happened.”
Tate and Steen met on Steen’s first day at USC: while Steen was trying to figure out how the phone system worked at Century Apartments, Tate approached her in the hallway and lent her a phone. They’ve been friends ever since. 
Steen met Markazi on a visit to Tate’s place during the height of the pandemic and has since gone on double dates with the couple and her boyfriend. 
“[Tate and Markazi] are extremely close. I’ve just seen them become one; they’re a team,” Steen said. “It’s great to see that growth since two years ago.”
The two complement one another, Steen said: Tate is a “motivational person” and helps take a load off Markazi to make things easier for him. Markazi, Steen said, often gives Tate great advice and the two of them talk through everything together.
Jacob Ullman, a USC alumnus and a good friend of Markazi’s, knew Markazi had been planning his proposal to Tate for a while. 
“At a certain point, it was figuring out exactly the right way to do it as he knew that [Tate] was the girl for him and he wanted to spend time with her,” Ullman said.
Both involved in covering the “glory days” of Pete Carroll at USC, Ullman and Markazi met at football practices and games and developed a friendship. Ullman, who now serves as senior vice president of production and talent development at FOX Sports, was involved in the games as a fan, an alum and a member of the sports media. 
Ullman met Tate on a weekend spent in Orange County and said they instantly “hit it off.”
“She’s just a wonderful, smart, sincere person and was just such a great addition to [Markazi’s] world,” Ullman said. “Instantly, we all liked her.”
When Ullman and Markazi’s other friends heard the story of how he and Tate worked together at the Daily Trojan, Ullman said they gave him a “needlessly hard time” about not remembering her from their college days.
“[We’d say] ‘There was this wonderful girl and you thought you were too cool for school and don’t even remember her,’” Ullman said with a laugh.
Tate and Markazi have yet to set a wedding date, but Ullman and Steen already know they want to be involved. Steen said she wants to help Steen with her dress and “whatever [else] she needs,” and Ullman, an ordained minister, said he hopes to be somehow involved in the ceremony. 
The underlying positivity of Tate and Markazi’s relationship, Ullman said, is the way it spotlights the possibility of romance in the most unexpected of places and times. 
“How amazing is it that the Daily Trojan could bring people together and have a happy ending, right?” Ullman said. “What a fairy tale.”
To college students looking to find love, both Markazi and Tate advise patience and openness above all else.
“I’m probably the worst person to give advice to because I never found love in college, and I don’t think anyone who’s in college wants to hear, ‘Listen, don’t worry, in 20 years, during a global pandemic, you’ll find your true love,’” Markazi said. “It’s amazing how life really works.”

Located between Il Giardino and CAVA, The Sammiche Shoppe is the newest addition to the assortment of restaurants at USC Village. With multiple eateries offering sandwiches at USC Village and around the USC campus, the question arises: What makes The Sammiche Shoppe different?
Owned and managed by Willie Jenkins, the sandwich spot differentiates themselves through their nutritious versions of traditional sandwiches. Jenkins opened the restaurant with the aim of providing healthier food choices without sacrificing excellent flavor and quality. They produce air-fried food with Boar’s Head Premium Cheeses and Meat without added grease  or salt.
At the start of his career, Jenkins followed in his father’s  footsteps and became a general contractor. But one day, he decided to follow his father’s  original dream instead and never looked back; his father always told him “construction is feast or famine, but people always have to eat,” prompting him to establish his own restaurant, The first Sammiche Shoppe, a health-conscious sandwich store, that opened in Inglewood four years ago.
His main inspiration came from his three sons. Their busy school schedules and involvement in extracurriculars and various sports kept his family constantly on the go. Making sandwiches for his sons became the go-to. 
“I could always make a sandwich, so that was a safe spot for me,” Jenkins said.
The restaurant’s name pays homage to the home states of Jenkins’ parents, Mississippi and Louisiana, where Sammiche is southern slang for sandwich.
His association with USC began when the dean of USC Sol Price School of Public Policy contacted him regarding catering services for an event. Since then The Sammiche Shoppe has catered multiple events for different departments across USC. When he was asked to open a restaurant at USC Village, he seized the opportunity to grow his dream.
The Sammiche Shoppe had its soft opening at USC on Sept. 20, featuring a limited menu. Currently, they offer dining, delivery and catering services. As of now, they are experimenting with the menu to see what will do well from the Inglewood store’s menu. 
Since its opening, the bestsellers have been the Turkey Pastrami, the Beef Pastrami and their specialty, the Lucy Mae Air-Fried Chicken Sammiche made with their in-house seasoning. The burst of flavor added by the in-house seasoning makes the sandwich unique and appetizing. The Lucy Mae comes with a mouth-watering spicy alternative as well with just the right amount of heat. The sandwiches are neither too dry nor too runny, the bread is air fried to a crispy brown (on request), the chicken is well-cooked and the vegetables are fresh.
To the delight of vegetarians, the restaurant also serves a Veggie Delight Sammiche, Veggie Sammiche Supreme and Grilled Cheese with the choice of swiss, pepper jack or cheddar cheese. The standout on the vegetarian menu is the Premium Grilled Cheese, containing a choice of two of the three cheeses for the price of one.
Presently, the dessert menu is limited to cookies. Priced almost the same as Insomnia’s, the cookies are unfortunately no match for the late-night cookie chain.
All the menu items are customizable. No pickles? Crispier bread? More sauce? They’ve got it covered — and some additions, like extra pickles on a sandwich, are complimentary. For pickle-lovers, they also sell a whole pickle for $1.25 and two for $2.25. 
Jenkins says he feels welcomed by the school and the students and parents who visit over the weekends for game days. To his surprise, he was delighted to see some old customers from his Inglewood outlet at the USC restaurant. Even though the shop recently opened, they already have some regular customers. 
“We have this one guy, he’s come at least three or four times since we opened,” Jenkins said.
Moving on, they plan on expanding their menu, offering smoothies and merchandise and opening online stores. They also plan to set up a butcher shop from 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. to offer students the alternative to buy their Boar’s Head cheeses and meats and make their own sandwiches at the convenience of their homes. While the ambience is not particularly Instagram-friendly yet, Jenkins said they plan on enhancing the shop by adding more artwork, adding another projector and organizing a lounge area to create an overall “country chic” vibe.
Currently, the restaurant is open 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday to Saturday and is closed on Sunday. The store will officially open in early November.
This initiative was risky for Jenkins, but he decided to follow through. He took money from his construction work and invested it in this venture and in his own ability to build something from the ground up. Jenkins’ entrepreneurial journey wasn’t without obstacles, but a determination to see his father’s words come to life is what strengthened him to persevere through the problems he faced, especially during the coronavirus pandemic. And Jenkins is sure to assure the USC community that he is  “here for the long haul.”
Resonating with USC’s battle cry makes Jenkins feel right at home at USC. “USC is a good place for us because [of] the mantra ‘Fight On,’” Jenkins said. “That’s what we had to do to get here.”
Corrections: The original version of this article stated that the restaurant’s name pays homage to Jenkins’ “home states of Mississippi and Louisiana.” This is incorrect; Jenkins’ parents are from those states, but he is not. It was also stated that “An extra pickle is $1.25 and two extras are $2.25.” This is also incorrect; extra pickles on sandwiches are complimentary, but whole pickles can also be purchased for the aforementioned prices. Finally, the original article noted that the Premium Grilled Cheese contains all three mentioned cheeses. This is also incorrect; The Premium Grilled Cheese is offered with any two of the three cheese options. The Daily Trojan sincerely regrets these errors.

Last weekend, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Music Director and Conductor Gustavo Dudamel presented a program marked by contrast. The orchestra performed Gustav Mahler’s First Symphony, a colossal fin de siècle work, and a relatively new concerto by a contemporary Mexican composer, Gabriela Ortiz, bridging the wide gap between late German Romanticism and Mexican Postmodernism. 
The violin concerto, “Altar de cuerda” (“String Altar”), comes as the latest in a series of seven “musical altars” written by Ortiz. Though the pieces are not explicitly religious, Ortiz imbues a spiritual life to them, allowing for postmodern expressions of syncretism and converging artistic disciplines. 
Despite Ortiz’s disposition towards forward-thinking musical constructs, the concerto takes on the traditional fast-slow-fast structuring that typically occurs over three movements. However, within those movements, a myriad of exciting techniques give new life to the centuries-old form. The three movements, “Morisco chilango,” “Canto abierto” and “Maya déco,” each present aspects of Mexican art and history, provoking reflection on cultural identity.
Ortiz’s wide palette of colors and effects conjures various impressions of Mexican culture. Most striking was the use of tuned glasses in the second movement; the wind section rubbed the lip of crystal glasses tuned to different pitches, creating an ethereal, airy soundscape.
Ortiz’s concerto was performed by 19-year-old violinist María Dueñas, to whom the piece is dedicated. Her playing met the challenges posed by the concerto, demonstrating a dazzling virtuosity. Dueñas and Dudamel showed an immense amount of chemistry, resulting in a tight, high-voltage rendition. Always a leading voice for new music, the Philharmonic treated the concerto with gravity and zeal. 
Ultimately, though, the crowning event of the night was the presentation of  Mahler’s First Symphony, often referred to as the “Titan.” Under Dudamel’s baton, the L.A. Philharmonic gave a breathtaking performance, pulling no punches, but instead all the stops.
When performing Mahler, pacing management looms over the entire process. Known for his enormously scaled symphonies, his works can often extend to an hour or more  — and the First Symphony was no different. As Mahler famously wrote to his fellow symphonist, Jean Sibelius: “A symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.”
In face of the bloated form, the Philharmonic presented a rendition that demanded complete attention for the entire performance. Committing to Mahler’s neurotically detailed score, the musicians truly leaned into the nuances, supplying a broad spectrum of orchestral color. 
The first movement began in a gossamery sheen, with the strings producing an eerie harmonic base, on top of which various motivic ideas were given by the winds. Gradually, the movement gave way to the lyricism so crucial to German Romanticism. Featuring a theme from Mahler’s own “Songs of a Wayfarer,” the music suggested pastoralism and natural beauty (an idea punctuated by various “cuckoos” sounding in the woodwinds). Finally, we reached a stirring conclusion, with raucous winds racing to the end. 
The Philharmonic performed the second movement with unparalleled character. The gruffness of the low strings combined with the spirited contributions from the winds recalled a Bavarian quality, as if coming from a Viennese beer tavern. Despite a heavy use of rubato, the musicians remained exactly synchronized for the movement’s entirety, allowing the audience to waltz along with them.
In stark contrast to the  first two movements, the third provides a starkly contrasting tone. Casting the folk tune “Bruder Martin” (also known as “Frère Jacques”) in minor, the mood became brooding and funereal, saturated with typical Mahlerian flavor — indeed, even klezmer-y moments of relief occasionally occurred throughout the piece. While a flat-footed performance could have led to a cartoonish, kitschy funeral march, the Philarmonic’s performance provided real gravity and substance.
Finally, the fiery fourth movement arrived in a tremendous blaze. Titled “Dall’ Inferno al Paradiso,” Mahler unabashedly draws from Dante’s “Divine Comedy” to formulate a narrative arc in the music. As listeners, our odyssey from the Inferno to Paradiso was a culmination of the vast realm of possibilities provided by the three preceding movements. 
Though struggle pervades the entirety of the work, the symphony ends triumphantly. With an eight-member horn section, Mahler’s soaring melodies beautifully intoned our arrival to the glorious realms of heaven.
The Philharmonic shined in many aspects of their performance  — most remarkably in their maintenance of total clarity. Despite the leviathan orchestration, every line could be heard, with a rhythmic unity strongly present through the entire symphony. Dudamel displayed complete comfort on the podium — no doubt a product of his long-standing familiarity with Mahler’s music. 
Dudamel’s program was just the first in a series of three performances of Mahler symphonies this season; the orchestra will play the Ninth Symphony with Michael Tilson Thomas (a USC alumnus) in January, and Zubin Mehta will lead the Third Symphony in March. Judging by their titanic start, the Philharmonic has a wealth of great music-making in store.

This past Monday marked the return of Indigenous Peoples’ Day, and a year since the holiday’s first formal acknowledgement by a sitting U.S. president. While this acknowledgement was decades in the making, proclamations such as this and other honorary measures generally pay lip service to the rights of Indigenous Peoples while the groups themselves still face pushback against Land Back, a campaign to return Native land back to Native peoples, and other land reparation campaigns like it.
Surfing is one of those unique sports that has an integral connection to the land. In the past year, the World Surf League has used its international events as an opportunity to incorporate land acknowledgements into various tour spots, including Lower Trestles on Acjachemen land and Banzai Pipeline on the North Shore of O’ahu. At the WSL Finals this year, Kumeyaay educator Stan Rodriguez hosted a tule boat build, a demonstration wherein he used harvested materials to create an original California watercraft.
The WSL also hosts grant programs, panels and other events that showcase Indigenous engagement with the sport. These are moves primarily geared to shift narratives surrounding the use of Indigenous land by the surfing community. What these moves don’t do is take responsibility for — or at least grapple with — the richest of the surfing world moving onto Indigenous lands and exacerbating issues of socioeconomic inequality, houselessness and environmental displacement. 
The surfing origin story is one that generally emphasizes a revitalization by white foreigners who brought the sport “a new life” in the ’50s and ’60s. Hawaiian scholar Isaiah Helekunihi Walker in his book, “Waves of Resistance: Surfing and History in Twentieth Century Hawaii,” comments that this revival is a mechanism of white saviorism. The “revitalization” is also an erasure of surfing as a tool of resistance for Native Hawaiians that were facing occupation by American fruit and sugar plantation owners.
In California, surfing arrived with the instruction and demonstration of Hawaiian George Freeth in 1907. Freeth was hired by Southern California developers Abbot Kinney and Henry Huntington (ring a bell?) to entice the public to surf and buy property along the coast. At the time, the coast was relatively unoccupied by white settlers — the Indigenous Peoples along the beaches were almost entirely wiped out by genocide and the mission system. 
The land and the water surrounding the California shoreline became a fable of opportunity and a birthplace of the beach lifestyle. 
The same myth was built in Hawai’i, along with an increasingly unsustainable and exploitative tourism industry. Pipeline on the North Shore is just one example of a “world-class wave” that exists among the Hawaiian islands. When a winter west/northwest swell comes in, it draws thousands of tourists and surf competitors to the North Shore to witness its glory.
Many of those visitors, especially during the coronavirus pandemic, decided to use the island as their own personal refuge. From 2019 to the beginning of 2022, the median cost of a single-family house on O’ahu increased from $789,000 to $1.15 million, and a quarter of all homes sold in 2021 were bought by out-of-state buyers, including Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Larry Ellison.
The prices have shut out Native Hawaiians, who account for just around 10% of the island’s total population but over a third of those without permanent housing. The government is trying to partner with nonprofits to house low-income families in some of the 76,000 unoccupied units across the islands, but it is just one piece of the puzzle.
At the end of the day, land acknowledgement is not enough when it comes to the influence large organizations like the WSL can wield on improving conditions for Indigenous Peoples. The wealthiest are again leveraging property as a means to make themselves richer and push other populations out.
Surfing is one part of the Hawaiian tradition of he’e nalu, which translates to “wave sliding.” Not just a practice for island royalty, anyone — regardless of social status — could participate in wave-riding and strengthen their spiritual connection with the ocean. Now, Hawaiians of all kinds are being pushed further out of their ancestral homeland, and further away from the beaches this sport arose from, by the very same people who began the process years ago.
If the World Surf League, or anyone in the surf community, really wanted to give back to  Indigenous Peoples whose land was pulled out from under them to the former’s benefit, then land acknowledgment and donation can’t be the end. Returning the land, decommodifying it and investing in its recovery from the degradation it suffered while stolen — all while working with the consent of Indigenous Peoples — is the next step that should be lobbied for to truly honor the sport and its creators.
Lauren Mattice is a first-year law student exploring issues surrounding the surf community. Her column, “Wave Check,” runs every other Monday.

USC football will face their first ranked opponent of the year Saturday when they take on No. 20 University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Coming off their first 6-0 start since 2006, the Trojans stand to face their toughest challenge yet from a Utah team that handed them a 42-26 loss last October.
Saturday’s 30-14 home victory over Washington State landed the Trojans at No. 7 in this week’s AP poll, with the University of Tennessee jumping them in the rankings after taking down Louisiana State University. But questions still linger about the team’s readiness for more skilled opponents, especially after a lackluster passing performance on Saturday.
“We missed a couple of throws, and we dropped some balls,” said Head Coach Lincoln Riley after Tuesday’s practice. “We were pretty good on the rest of them, there’s just not a whole lot left.”
Sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams posted a lackluster performance, completing only 15 of his 29 passes for 188 yards. In addition, the usually sure-handed sophomore receiver Mario Williams recorded 2 drops on the day. USC’s rushing offense, however, struggled far less, with redshirt senior running back Travis Dye carrying the ball 28 times for 149 yards and one touchdown.
“Our linemen doing a wonderful job blocking and opening up holes is what really stood out to me,” Dye said. 
Last year, USC entered their tilt with Utah 3-2 after home losses to Stanford and Oregon State. After defeating both the Cardinal and the Beavers on the road this season, however, the Trojans will look to continue their revenge tour against the defending Pac-12 champions.
Before a tough loss to UCLA Saturday dropped them nine spots in the AP poll, the Utes were ranked No. 11. Despite the loss, talented junior quarterback Cameron Rising passed for 287 yards, adding 59 more and 2 touchdowns on the ground. The Trojans have had success stopping dual-threat quarterbacks so far this year and lead the nation with 24 sacks. 
Lincoln Riley recruited Rising out of high school as Oklahoma’s head coach in 2017 and is quite familiar with the quarterback and his play style.
“He bounced around on us a little bit, but he’s obviously found a tremendous home,” said Riley of the Utes’ signal caller. “It seems like he’s really been a great fit for their team and what they’re doing offensively, and he’s run it very well.”
The Trojan offense will face a new challenge against the skilled Utah defense. Their 315.8 overall yards allowed per game makes them the best defense USC is set to face so far this year, a frightening prospect given the Trojans’ offensive struggles against Washington State. The Utes have held opponents to an average of 179.3 yards through the air this season, placing them in the top 20 pass coverage units in the nation.
A key member of that unit is sophomore cornerback Clark Phillips III, whose 5 interceptions currently leads the NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision. His 80-yard pick-six against UCLA Saturday was his second in two weeks, and an outstanding three-interception performance the week before against Oregon State earned him the Chuck Bednarik, Walter Camp, Jim Thorpe and Pac-12 defensive player of the week awards.
USC’s last away game against Oregon State saw the Trojans hit their first real hiccup of the year as they were unable to find the endzone until the fourth quarter. Just like in Saturday’s win, when Caleb Williams struggled (completing only 16 of his 36 passes),  Dye carried the offense on his back (with 133 yards and a touchdown on 19 carries).
Dye’s commitment to the team was evident when he commented on his unusually heavy load after practice Tuesday.
“With a quarterback like Caleb [Williams], you really never do anticipate [28 carries], but you’re always ready for it,” Dye said. “If the team needs me to do it, I’ll do it. I definitely could’ve done more.”
As USC looks to stay perfect, Utah will aim to avoid their third loss of the season, as winning out will be necessary for a shot at defending their Pac-12 title after their loss to UCLA. Saturday’s contest kicks off at 5 p.m. in Utah’s Rice-Eccles Stadium.

This past July, news broke that TikTok star Addison Rae’s father, Monty Lopez, had allegedly forced a woman almost half his age into cheating with him. Just within the last month, that same social media platform was taken by storm as model Sumner Stroh uploaded a series of videos exposing Maroon 5 singer Adam Levine for cheating on his wife by texting other women on social media. And now, just this past week, social media platforms were once again set ablaze as Ned Fulmer, a member of the four-man comedy group The Try Guys, was exposed for cheating on his long-time wife with his associate producer. 
Is there a distinguishable trend forming? The New York Times reports that “infidelity appears to be on the rise, particularly among older men and young couples.” Although a significant amount of major celebrity cheating scandals have been men cheating on their wives, that same article goes on to add that the likelihood of women to cheat has also risen proportionally. A Pennslyvania State University survey of individuals ages 24 to 32 detailed that a quarter of couples and “cohabiting young men and women reported that either they, or their partners, or both of them, had sex with someone else while they were still in their current relationship.”
After discerning that there is, in fact, a rising trend in infidelity, we can now scrutinize how it affects celebrities, and more importantly, their fans.
There has been great condemnation of hook-up culture and how it has marred expectations of healthy romantic relationships, especially for younger generations. When there are prominent figures like Fulmer and Levine who publicly pride themselves on their loving marriage and family, it gives credence to the possibility of and hope for a happy and secure love life. However, when it comes out that the outspoken nature of that love was based on falsehoods, that credence and hope dissipate. 
There is a lack of healthy, faithful couples for young people to look up to. Jay-Z cheated on Beyoncé. The Kardashians have been wrapped up in accusations of infidelity for years. And just last year, it came out that beloved comedian John Mulaney allegedly cheated on his ex-wife, joining Kevin Hart in a niche circle of unfaithful comics. Adultery has found a comfortable space within the stars of Hollywood. 
With societal influence from both media and reality, it can be difficult for young adults and teens to discern the difference between the signs of a toxic relationship and realistic expectations for a healthy relationship. And unfortunately, there is no simple solution. Media coverage won’t spend time on couples that are thriving because there isn’t any news there. 
Rather than focusing on the media and what receives news coverage, it’s important to instead focus on individualism and interpersonal relationships that tend to be ignored. Talking about boundaries and expectations is of the utmost importance, and building communication skills in a trusting environment is the pinnacle. It’s more important to have discussions in and out of romantic relationships and to also better yourself as an individual in order to prepare for commitment. 
It’s scary being alone in a world riddled by mistrust. Most of us want a special someone to be there for us no matter what. But take a good look at yourself in the mirror before you search — if you’re not ready single, you won’t be ready taken.

The psychological and behavioral repercussions of child stardom are well-documented. Miley Cyrus, Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears — we can all think of a star raised in the limelight who subsequently suffered a very public breakdown. But is this mental and emotional turmoil the fate of child influencers? What will happen to the children who knew a camera lens before they knew how to walk? What sort of pressure does it cause child influencers to be the breadwinners of their families before they even understand the concept of income or fame?
The scary truth is that we don’t know the long-term psychological ramifications of being a child influencer yet. Psychologist Dr. Pamela Rutledge stated in an interview with Insider that child influencers run the risk of sacrificing their identity for the sake of fueling the perpetual content creation machine. 
“It isn’t like somebody is giving you a part to play in or writing a script for you. You’re having to do this sort of creation all the time. At what point is it you, and at what point is it this persona you’ve created?” Rutledge said.
A family influencer lifestyle could complicate family dynamics and relationships as well. If a camera is always in the child’s face, how do they know when their parents are being genuine, and when they are performing? This only becomes more harrowing when we consider family influencers who regularly prank their children. How do you place trust in a parent who consistently violates that trust for views?
Even if we could set aside the argument about the psychological ramifications of fame during early stages of development, the predator argument simply rears its ugly head. According to an article by CNET, TikTok accounts primarily featuring young children are at risk of exposure to online predators. It begs the question — what could possibly outweigh a parent’s obligation to their child’s safety? Why is it that the risk of exposure to online predators and predatory behavior is not reason enough to shield children from the dangers of child influencership?
 The CNET article also details the disturbing case of @wren.eleanor on TikTok —  a family influencer known only as “Jacquelyn” who posts almost exclusively about her three-year-old daughter, Wren for an audience of over 17 million followers. Wren is one of many children whose photos dominate their parents’ social media feeds and are vulnerable as a result. Parents of child influencers can no longer feign ignorance of the risks either.
According to the CNET article, “Concerned onlookers have pointed Jacquelyn toward comments that appear to be predatory and have warned her that videos in which Wren is in a bathing suit, pretending to insert a tampon or eating various foodstuffs have more watches, likes and saves than other content.” These concerns have seemingly been brushed aside, as the page is still publicly available.
This unique vulnerability to strangers isn’t staying online either. According to CNET, family influencer Rachel Barkman made the decision to keep her three-year-old son’s face off the Internet after a real-life encounter in the forest. Barkman had been posting TikTok content exhibiting her son’s prowess for mushroom picking until a stranger came up to Barkman and her son, calling the child by name and asking him about mushrooms. 
“I immediately went cold at the realization that I had equipped complete strangers with knowledge of my son that puts him at risk,” Barkman said. 
While some might hesitate to say that online predators compromise a child’s safety in the real world, cases like this prove that child influencers aren’t safe online or in real life. Public social media accounts that freely share a child’s name, likes, hobbies, skills and face are actively equipping strangers with the personal information most likely to lower a child’s guard in a face-to-face encounter.
Parents that are willing to exploit their children’s privacy and well-being for internet fame and monetary gain don’t seem inclined to stop once their child is grown; TikTok star Addison Rae is a great example of teen-turned-adult stars still haunted by the managerial presence of a parent. According to NBC News, Addison Rae’s father, Monty Lopez, is still attempting to profit off of his adult daughter’s fame. Lopez established an agency for TikTok stars, despite sources close to Lopez telling NBC that “Lopez was not responsible for Rae’s deals and opportunities and sought to take advantage of her success.” 
The privacy that was once a right all children enjoyed has been rendered a commodity for certain parents to capitalize on. Until widespread legislation or demonetizations occur across platforms like YouTube, Instagram and TikTok, private childhoods will gradually become a luxury of the past.
Above all, we must advocate for the demonetization of all public social media accounts that predominantly feature children. Children are not performers. They do not have a strong sense of identity that can withstand the duality of performing online and existing in the household simultaneously. We need to collectively reckon with the fact that exchanging a child’s personal life for daily exposure and profit is a form of abuse. This is not an issue that can be solved by banning only the extreme, highly visible cases of child abuse. The parents are stealing their child’s safe place and home by converting it into a stage accessible by millions, from which there is no break or time off.
