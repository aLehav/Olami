Coachella is nothing without its performances. No, I’m not talking about the headliners’ sets or the indie bands on the Mojave or Gobi stages. The best performances lie within the outfits found throughout the fields and around crowds. Onlookers can usually expect some reference to Bohemian-chic styles, with lacey dusters, chunky vintage leather belts and some ridiculous Panama hat — all of which will never be worn again beyond the weekend. Some festival-goers take a more rave-like approach to their weekend’s outfits, opting for neons, fishnets, face gems and glitter — so much glitter. Nonetheless, there was always a cohesive aspect to Coachella guests’ fashion choices, as each Instagrammable outfit appears to complement the next.
So, where did this cohesiveness go when the infamous festival took a three-year hiatus? As attendees regrouped over the past two weeks in the desert for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, it became apparent that the universality of the ‘uniform’ completely vanished. 
Never before has the “dress code” been as ignored or tossed aside as this year. While some underlying trends tethered groups together, the pictures scoured across social media portrayed an ultimate clash in fashion reality: festival-goers in bright mesh matching sets, nearly naked attendees, over-the-top glam and accessory wearers and some that opted out of the performance aspect altogether. 
In any sense, here are some of the biggest trends to come out of this year’s Coachella that you should incorporate into your next festival fashion escapade:  
Less is more
More than anything, one of the best breakthroughs to come from this year’s festival is the prominence of casual outfits. 
Influencers and celebrities known for their ostentatious fashion came to the grounds this year dressed in noticeably tamer hues and less dramatic styles. For instance, Kylie Jenner briefly appeared in jeans and a leather jacket, while Devon Lee Carlson decided on a sports tee and a baggy skirt. Casual dressing is the quickest way to opt out of a music festival that has evolved into a twisted costume contest. This, of course, is not to bash dress-up lovers everywhere, but rather, spread some relief to those exhausted from matching influencers’ standards year after year. As this casual movement grows, perhaps eventually Coachella culture will recenter itself as a whole to the original point of the festival: the music.  
Monochrome mania
For starters, monochrome reached new heights this year. Whether it was Emma Chamberlain’s all-red ensemble (complete with platform Jeffrey Campbell cowboy boots) or Vanessa Hudgens’s fuschia fantasy, monochrome was a sure way to not go unnoticed on the festival grounds. Influencer Bretman Rock even utilized the one color look two days in a row, stepping out in a pure baby blue Chanel set, soon followed by a neon green Ottolinger pairing for day three. While bright monochrome outfits were typically reserved for festivals such as Electric Daisy Carnival, these past weekends have proven that anything goes at Coachella now, in the best way possible.
Pearls are more fun
Pearls are the unlikely rebellious choice to fight the Boho-chic standards that the majority adheres to at the festival. While the safer, more predictable choice in accessories typically revolved around crystals and layered pendants (which almost always teetered on cultural appropriation), pearls usher in a new wave of desert jewelry. Although most pearls were seen in necklace form, some guests utilized them as embellishments for their denim sets and even restructured the pearls for their own unique corsets, concocting the perfect mix of Victorian Age drama and music festival freedom. 
Hopefully, these trends guide you in the rest of your festival adventures in 2022 or inspire you to break the mold of fashion norms in any setting. But, hey, who am I to tell you what to wear?

Like many people, I grew up with Disney films. It sounds cliché, but I really did want to be a princess and live out my fantasy. My idea of a fun weekend was visiting the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco’s Presidio, where I’d search for all the background stories of my favorite Disney princesses. From dressing up as Belle to rewatching “The Little Mermaid” whenever I was feeling down, I loved — and still love — Disney princess movies and the happily ever afters they represent.
Because I’ve always been drawn to fairytales and princesses, it makes sense to think reimaginings of fairytales in animation have so much potential. As overused as it may be, I don’t think the “princess” trope is necessarily outdated, nor should it be banished. In fact, it’s because princesses occupy such an important space in contemporary pop culture that I think they need to be recentered and made more inclusive. 
Just look at Harvard student Julia Riew, who made headlines earlier this year for writing her own full-length musical inspired by a Korean folk tale. “Shimcheong: A Folktale” features a Korean princess and made its viral debut in Riew’s TikTok video, in which an animated version of Riew sings her original song, “Dive.” The text introducing the video states, “There was no Korean Disney princess so I decided to make my own.” 
Beyond writing narratives inspired by folklore, creators also take beloved European fairytales and craft them for a modern audience. The animated film “Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs” (2019) attempts to reimagine the story of Snow White. As a whole, the narrative lacks compared to the popular Disney princess films — here, relationships between characters appear to be built more on classic fairytale tropes than actual, carefully crafted development. 
However, the film has to be commended for its visually gorgeous animation and ability to represent fairytale elements in a new light. The story takes a spin on the classic Snow White narrative. In this iteration, Snow White is plus-size and transforms into a “thin” version of herself by wearing magical red shoes. 
Snow White’s father, the king, has gone missing. Snow White must evade her evil stepmother and enlist the help of seven dwarfs — who are actually princes under a curse — to help her find her father. 
As someone who doesn’t conform to the visual archetype of the Disney princesses that I grew up loving so much, I found “Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs” an inspiring new take on what makes someone truly a “princess.” Even as I grew up watching Disney princess movies, I couldn’t shake the feeling that being a princess relied more on one’s appearance than one’s personality. To truly be a princess, princes had to fall in love with you just by looking at you and people would sing songs praising your beauty, which would conform to their standards of thinness (see: “Belle”) — this was an ideal that I was indoctrinated into.  
Because of that, I liked that “Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs” had a princess who was more like me. Here was a girl who loved eating desserts and was OK with not being traditionally thin. She didn’t have the traditional fairytale body shape of princesses, one that I had thought was the measure of “attractiveness.” I felt represented, as if I could be a princess too. 
Snow White’s internal conflict about being “beautiful” struck me to my core, especially given the fact that the dwarfs, or princes, needed a beautiful woman’s kiss to break their curse. Would the princes still help her find her father if she didn’t conform to their vision of beauty? Would she be accepted for who she was if she wasn’t their version of a beautiful princess?
From a storytelling point of view, Snow White’s alter ego, the thin “Red Shoes,” felt symbolically powerful. In a way, the character of “Red Shoes” revealed the complicated underpinnings of fantasy. “Red Shoes” was the princes’ fantasy. She wasn’t Snow White. 
Despite the film’s message of self-love, its marketing fed into the very same pressures that it wanted to critique. “Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs” was embroiled in controversy because of its insensitive billboard at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, which centered the line: “What if Snow White was no longer beautiful and the 7 Dwarfs not so short?” The billboard juxtaposed the plus-size Snow White and her thin form, implying that being plus-size meant that one wasn’t beautiful. 
The campaign’s fat-shaming was widely rebuked and serves as a testament to the difficulty of distancing fairytale reimaginings from the fairytale ideals that inspired them. For a film that rebels against shallowness, it was disheartening to see its marketing promote the opposite. 
In considering these animated fairytales, this seems to be the paradox of princesses. How can we dismantle fairytales’ lack of inclusiveness while also playing into their significance? Can we truly rewrite magic and shape our own happily ever afters? 
It’s a challenge, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try. To represent ourselves as we are — that’s the realest kind of fantasy there is.

From Nella Larsen’s “Passing” to Maxine Hong Kingston’s “Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a Girlhood Among Ghosts,” the American literary tradition has seen well over a century of diverse works from women of color writers who are constantly redefining the canon. One especially modern addition to the catalog was recently released: Daphne Palasi Andreades’ novel “Brown Girls.”
Published Jan. 4, “Brown Girls” follows the interwoven stories of a group of women of color from Queens as they navigate their complex identities and find their voice and power in America. Unpacking “Brown Girls” makes for riveting discussion, prompting analysis of how Andreades maintains and challenges the nation’s literary traditions through her debut novel.
As Andreades introduces the lively borough of Queens from the “scent of bubbling oil and smoke” to “sun-warmed concrete,” she immerses the reader within this multicultural setting. Portraying the beautiful chaos of the community, the novel transforms into a poetic love letter to Andreades’ home city.
In addition to encapsulating this bustling environment, Andreades gives Queens a distinct voice through the collective narration of brown girls as they recount their attempts to advance in society while simultaneously maintaining their sense of identity. Through these narrative techniques, Andreades manifests the American literary tradition, originating from Ralph Waldo Emmerson, of focusing on the culture, dialect and environment of ordinary people to authentically illustrate the American experience.
While the narrative specifically concentrates on the characters living in Queens, Andreades uses their stories to capture the universal experiences of women from marginalized communities. However, as the stories and feelings of the brown girls overlap, readers may feel dissatisfied with the lack of specificity and detail, which could help differentiate the experiences of these characters from various backgrounds. 
While some may critique Andreades’ universal focus, her attempt to challenge and diversify the mainstream American experience is admirable. Dominated by white narratives, the “universal” fails to live up to its name, as it does not encapsulate everyone’s experiences, especially minorities. By highlighting the day-to-day racism, classism and misogyny brown girls face, Andreades succeeds in representing the obstacles people of color constantly encounter in America. 
Andreades directly addresses this tension between specificity and universality within the chapter  “Art.” Here, Andreades explores the complicated and uncomfortable relationship artists from marginalized communities have with art itself. Expected to translate the experiences in “palatable [and] acceptable” ways, these artists feel trapped with the “prison” of society’s presumptions for their artwork. 
Readers can appreciate Andreades’ ability to reflect the anxieties of marginalized artists in “Art.” However, Andreades struggles to escape the confining limitations of artistic tradition imposed on people of color. Andreades’ use of a collective narrator (“we,” “our”) and focus on developing a universal story calls into question whether Andreades challenges or upholds society’s horizon of expectation for marginalized artists.
Concentrating on the characters’ narrative of navigating their generational and personal trauma, Andreades follows the footsteps of other American writers such as Toni Morrision and Quiara Alegría Hudes, who deconstruct the concepts of tragedy within American society. Through this trauma, Andreades once again demonstrates how she tries to balance the specific with the universal. While every person has a different and personal interaction with trauma, the universal pain and agony associated with trauma helps people develop a sense of empathy and kinship with each other. 
“Brown Girls” explores both the destructive and unifying force of trauma, as the novel follows the characters’ journey in navigating and contextualizing their trauma. Their trauma forces them to leave the neighborhoods of Queens to create new lives, disconnected from their past and their community. However, simultaneously, the characters’ trauma pushes them to reconnect with their hometown and childhood friends. Instead of denying trauma or keeping it hidden, Andreades grapples with it and explores how empowerment and empathy can transform trauma into a powerful unifying tool. 
While readers may come away from the novel with various perspectives and opinions on its exploration of the brown girl experience, the power of Andreades’ lyrical and multilayered prose, which reflects the complexities of the American identity, is irrefutable.

Cameron Williams was only nine years old when he first sat down in front of a Steinway & Sons piano and pressed on its black and white keys. His family inherited the 100-year-old piece from his great-grandmother and had no way of predicting the passion it would spark within their son.  
After taking lessons with a local teacher growing up, Williams received instruction from University of Arizona professor of piano Tannis Gibson. While working with her, Williams elected to pursue piano in college. However, he did not want to limit his studies to only piano. 
“There was a lot of tension when I was in high school because I was always good at and interested in math and also really good at and interested in playing the piano,” Williams said. “Then I discovered the possibility that I would not necessarily have to pick one because I could do a double major.” 
Williams, now a fifth-year senior, arrived as a member of Thornton School of Music professor Bernadene Blaha’s piano studio, though he eventually added his second major, computer science games, afterward. Blaha first met Williams when he was a senior in high school asking to take a lesson — a common step for aspiring piano students. Upon first meeting, Williams’ talent and drive for piano were evident.
“I was fully confident that he had incredible potential. It was evident that he was extremely talented, extremely intelligent and his attitude was very positive,” Blaha said. “I could tell that he was filled with a passion for music, music performance, as well as all of his academic studies.”
Blaha, after five years of weekly classes, said that Williams continues to impress her, whether that be by choosing his own music for recitals, striving to continually challenge himself or pursuing rigorous academics because of his double major. 
“To be able to do a piano performance major, having the profile that he does, while managing another major in computer science is really outstanding,” Blaha said. “He also has done very, very well in competitions and has performed under pressure.”
During his time working with Blaha, Williams traveled to the Amalfi Coast in Italy and Leone, France to compete and learn from some of the most premiere piano players in the world.  Although he enjoys playing around the world, Williams remained insistent that to make a career out of piano, he would need more than just talent.  
“[As a pianist], I was kind of hedging my bets. If I become successful as a pianist, I get super lucky, I’m going to do it,” he said.
Unlike the lifelong video game creators that share his major today, Williams came to USC as an avid pianist, feeling instead that he delightfully stumbled into making games. However, he got fully involved in the program after his junior year when he received a summer internship with Wizards of the Coast — the company behind “Dungeons & Dragons” and “Magic: The Gathering,” a game he played since the age of 10 after coincidentally learning to play the game at a piano summer camp). 
“I was sitting in my apartment in February, and my roommate asked me if I had seen this email from USC games because they were having Wizards of the Coast interviewing people on campus for internships … and I had not seen the email,” he said. “If I had chosen to not make breakfast that day, she might never have told me, and I never would have gone.”
As a frequent collaborator with Williams, Weston Bell-Geddes has closely watched Williams chase his two passions. As lead producer of SPOOKULELE, a USC Advanced Games Project, Bell-Geddes has had a front row seat to this balancing act.
“Recently, he was preparing for his recital, which I went to. And so he spent a lot of time doing that, he had to take a lot of time off,” said Bell-Geddes, a junior majoring in interactive entertainment. “But he never fully stepped back, which I appreciate and respect from his duties on SPOOKULELE.” 
Although Williams saw his two lives as completely independent, he is a unique asset to the development of SPOOKULELE, where players use music to fight ghosts, according to Bell-Geddes. 
“He uses a lot of his knowledge from piano in our game,” Bell-Geddes said. “We think he’s a really valuable asset and person on the team because he can bring in a whole new perspective.” 
After working on a plethora of games and competing in international piano competitions, Williams has elected to keep piano as  a passion for now, with a job at Wizards of the Coast designing magic cards lined up after graduation. 
“Working on ‘Magic’ is basically my dream job,” he said. “I’m super grateful to have gotten this opportunity because … it’s really something I’m passionate about so I feel super lucky to be able to work on it.”

Regardless of the installation of hybrid learning earlier in the year and the University’s gradual return to in-person operation, the Class of 2022 is expected to graduate in person. Following this year’s addresses — to be given by valedictorian Adam Karelin and commencement speaker Allyson Felix — the Class of 2022 will turn its mortarboard tassel from right to left, signifying their transition to USC alumni. 
Karelin, a senior majoring in composition, was selected as the valedictorian for the 2022 graduating class. Karelin, who will pursue his master’s degree in arts leadership at USC next fall, looks to develop sustainable opportunities for artists. His accomplishments include having his music performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, being named a National YoungArts Finalist in Classical Music Composition in 2019 and receiving the ASCAP Foundation Morton Gould Award. At USC, Karelin played with the USC Thornton Symphony, Wind Ensemble, Brass Ensemble, Trombone Choir, Baroque Sinfonia and Concerto Chamber Orchestra — where he now serves as music director.
“I feel very humbled to be in such company … I’m in a senior class of extraordinarily brilliant, talented, wonderful people,” Karelin said. “I love all my peers so much, and it just easily could have been any of them who were selected with this honor.”
When Karelin started his undergraduate education, he wasn’t “perfect” with time management or taking care of his health. He said he used to overload himself and finish tasks by sacrificing his mental health and sleep while taking 20 units per semester but has since improved his habits throughout his academic career. 
“Toward the end of junior year, I realized the quality of the things I produce when I’m in that delirious, exhausted state is not as high-quality as the stuff I produce when I’m taking care of myself,” Karelin said. “I’m not exactly where I want to be yet, but it’s a continuous evolution.”
During the pandemic lockdown, Karelin said he was tempted to overload himself academically as a distraction from the state of the world. Mental health resources at the University were “tremendously helpful” in reprioritizing his health, he said. 
“That really helped me manage my time during lockdown and not just develop these unhealthy coping mechanisms of ‘I’m just going to do work, work, work and forget about the world,’” Karelin said.
Salutatorian Shreya Daniel, a senior majoring in health and human sciences, said studying topics that “felt true” to her helped her thrive academically, even as a pre-med student. Daniel decided to take classes outside of her major, such as Bollywood dance and theater, and she also picked up an occupational science minor.
“Being able to choose classes that I was interested in and not worry too much about what it would look like later on, turned out to look well later on, and I was rewarded for it,” Daniel said.
Daniel worked with the USC Admission Center for nearly three years as a student ambassador, serves as a member of honor societies Phi Beta Kappa and Phi Kappa Phi, and maintained a 4.0 GPA each semester from Fall 2018 to Spring 2021. After taking a gap year to shadow doctors specializing in developmental-behavioral pediatrics at the University of Chicago, Daniel plans to apply for medical school so she can develop integrated, holistic healthcare for kids.
“Having a goal of what I want to be and envisioning the day I have my own clinic and working … even though [medical school] is a big, intimidating and scary process, knowing that I feel really passionate about doing this and that there’s an end point that’s all worth it is making it a lot more exciting,” Daniel said.
Former Trojan Democrats president, VoteSC director of programming and member of the Army Reserve Officer Training Corps Andrew Binder was “shocked” when he heard he was selected as a salutatorian.
“I wasn’t really necessarily focused on this in college,” said Binder, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law. “I was more focused on extracurriculars and community service and things like that. I felt really, really grateful to all of the people who had given me the opportunities that led to this moment.”
Binder said his family and the friends he made throughout his various commitments were key players in his success.
“I feel like I really learned from a lot of my peers because I feel like the culture at USC is a culture of high achievers and a culture of community service,” Binder said. “They were really the ones who made it happen.”

After learning that the Ground Zero Performance Café will be closing at the end of this semester, Nina Lu, a freshman majoring in screenwriting, reflected on her opportunity to speak to USC alumnus Alec Benjamin, a singer-songwriter who now has more than 13 million monthly listeners on Spotify, about their shared love of the cafe. Lu told the Daily Trojan that Benjamin had visited the cafe a couple of weeks ago and told her about what Ground Zero means to him.
“He said that [Ground Zero] was his first place where he could perform live and that it was a special place, and that really stuck with me,” Lu said. “I feel like a lot of us can get our start at Ground Zero, but that’s getting taken away.”
In December 2022, two unoccupied residence halls, Marks Hall and Trojan Residence Hall, are set to be demolished along with Ground Zero. Since its reopening in 2018, Ground Zero has been home to a weekly “Open Mic Night” and monthly “First Friday” events that give USC students a space to perform their music, poetry and comedy and share their visual art.
In the past month, many regular attendees of the Ground Zero Performance Café heard through word of mouth that the cafe would be closing permanently after this semester, though no formal announcement was made. When Lu first heard the news, she thought it was a joke.
“I was just at Ground Zero one Monday, and I overheard it from a friend that was like, ‘Oh, they’re tearing this place down,’” Lu said. 
When she realized it was not a joke after a Ground Zero manager confirmed the rumor, Lu immediately created a petition through Change.org titled, “STOP USC FROM TEARING DOWN GROUND ZERO.” The petition has garnered over 200 signatures at time of publication, and Lu suspects it was an announcement in itself to the many students who hadn’t heard the news.
Quentin Dean, a freshman majoring in psychology, heard the news from Lu directly and said he was shocked. 
“[Ground Zero] is really being used by students,” Dean said. “There’s a clear audience for that sort of thing.”
Through the petition, Lu hopes to highlight the level of student engagement the cafe has had.
“I just wanted to show the University that this place mattered,” Lu said. “We actually cared about it.” 
For many students, Ground Zero has served as what Jaren Savage, a junior majoring in international relations, describes as a “safe space to go and connect.”  
“For many, many people, it was an extremely safe space. Nobody judged each other. We’d all just share what we’re working on and just encourage and give feedback,” Savage said.
Since the start of the fall semester, Savage has been performing his music for the cafe and is now working on his first music video, directed by a friend he met through Ground Zero. The cafe was also the first place Savage had ever performed his original music. 
“Without Ground Zero, I wouldn’t have any of the learning opportunities or performance opportunities that I’ve had,” Savage said.  
As both a performer and a regular attendee, Dean similarly shared that when a performer gets on stage, they’re met with a very “receptive” and “supportive” audience that helps get rid of nerves. 
“Everyone’s nervous a bit, but the nerves completely go away once you’re on stage, and you realize it’s not that big of a deal,” Dean said, “Everyone’s there because they want to see what you’re doing.”
Lu said Ground Zero is especially unique in providing a space for students of color to find community and be creative.
“It’s like the first place I’ve seen where a lot of people of color I know have gathered there and are able to show off their art,” Lu said, “I don’t know another space on campus like that.”

In a 2014 Washington Post article, writer Wesley Lowery posed a question: How many police shootings are there in a year? 
The answer was fairly simple: No one knows. The federal government keeps no national database on the number of people killed by police. 
After seeing Lowery’s report on the lack of transparency about police-involved shootings, Brian Finch, director of USC Dornsife’s Center for Economic and Social Research Southern California Population Research Center and a professor of sociology and spatial sciences, set out to answer the same question.
Researchers at the CESR developed the National Officer-Involved Homicide Database, a catalog that documents fatal incidents involving the police that now serves as a tool for researchers to learn more about police department operations. At the time, the team noticed a number of online efforts in place to collect the data, such as Fatal Encounters, a national police homicide database run by D. Brian Burghart, the former editor and publisher of the Reno News & Review. NOIHD builds upon Fatal Encounters by adding more detail, granularity and cross-referencing to the initiative, Burghart said. 
Finch reached out to Burghart, who started Fatal Encounters in 2012, after reading about Burghart in the New York Times. Burghart said the data needed to be “institutionalized,” meaning an institution should manage the data rather than his independent work. 
“The likelihood of finding somebody who is interested in doing this for public service reasons, it’s just not likely,” Burghart said. “However, I think you’ll find that at a university. That’s what the NOIHD data is — the first step toward institutionalizing this data.” 
Though the NOIHD is rather new, researchers began to draw conclusions from the database’s detail and precision, including two papers published in early April at the annual Population Association of America meetings. 
Josh Gagné, a graduate student studying sociology at Stanford University, wrote one of the papers, which estimated a “risk-adjusted propensity to kill civilians” among police departments. He created an estimate for the number of civilian homicides expected from a department based on factors such as demographics or the income of their jurisdiction. Gagné said the NOIHD was particularly useful because he could link several variables together, which was crucial to his research. 
“What the NOIHD allowed me to do is not just have access to this Fatal Encounters data, which was already publicly available, but the NOIHD also links that to a bunch of these other datasets,” Gagné said. “It’s super convenient to go ahead and cross check these things [in NOIHD]. Sometimes, you have missing data that you can impute, but there’s this advantage of having a number of these datasets already conveniently located in one place.” 
For any given police department in the database in any year dating back to 2000, the NOIHD compiles variables like the amount of crimes, violent crimes and homicides, the violent crime rates and the amount of officer-involved homicides. It also records characteristics of the areas officers patrol, such as socioeconomic and racial demographics, information about officers assaulted or killed, whether there’s a use of force policy or a no-pursuit policy and the years of training required to become an officer in that department. 
The NOIHD is the first database with this many variables at the level of law enforcement agencies. The unprecedented detail of the database will let researchers study at a much lower level of aggregation, instead of at the county or state level, which has “never really been done,” Finch said. 
The NOIHD also revealed a potential effect of sheriff-coroner offices. The decision of whether a death is classified as an officer-involved homicide is overseen by a sheriff-coroner in only three states, including California. Usually, a coroner is an independent position, but in these states, the sheriff’s department directly oversees sheriff coroners. Finch said the NOIHD data show “severe undercounts” in jurisdictions with sheriff-coroners compared to those with independent coroners. 
Finch also said several other NOIHD-based papers work through the pipeline. The researchers look to next examine the impact of certain policies on officer-involved homicides, such as local gun restrictions or departmental no-chase policies. 
“There’s over 800 variables in the database,” Finch said. “Researchers that are using it can go in and explore tons of different hypotheses that they’re interested in and analyze them.”

The first time I picked up a copy of the Daily Trojan was as an indecisive high school graduate touring colleges a month before the college commitment deadline. The edition, which to date, remains in my bedroom back home in India, cemented that DT would be a part of the equation in choosing USC. 
But if you told this shy, unsure freshman — who did not end up joining DT until sophomore year because she had no idea where the newsroom was or how to get involved — that she would end up serving as editor-in-chief her senior year, she wouldn’t have believed you. However cliche this may sound, at a large University like USC, DT has been the little corner I’ve felt most at home. 
Student journalism, especially at a place such as USC where scandals are the norm, has given me a larger purpose — keeping the community informed and holding the administration accountable. Neither of which have been easy, and both have come before my own mental health, academics and social life. 
While serving as the EIC, I remember working over 50 hours a week while taking 21 units of some of my hardest classes and not sleeping more than three hours most days. I remember not making it to any of my classes for two weeks because covering the sexual assault protests happening on campus was more important. I cried every single day for a month because I was doing too much, taking on too much and incapable of admitting that I had reached my breaking point — not to myself and much less to anyone else. 
During this time, I started working on a piece featuring USC survivor stories. Listening to accounts of these women’s experiences was taxing enough by itself, and I found myself crying after every interview I did but realizing through their stories that I had undergone a similar experience my freshman year was even more devastating. Rather than processing all the complicated emotions that arose from the revelation, I continued working on autopilot mode because I simply did not have the time for a breakdown. 
None of this was expected of me, but as someone who has always put the story and work before herself, DT served as the perfect catalyst for burying myself in work as a distraction. There’s not much I would change about my experience at DT and the innumerous ways it has allowed me to grow as a leader, a writer and a journalist — but I can’t help but wonder if this is how it’s always going to be?
As a journalist, will I always put my own sanity and mental health second because the story is more important? Will I push myself harder than I need to due to how important the job is? Are these behaviors and pitfalls of journalism first developed in student newsrooms where we are expected to be both full-time students and journalists?
A lot of my behavior stemmed from my own personality and work ethic — but student newsrooms reinforce many of these issues with every single person being exhausted, balancing multiple commitments and not doing great mentally. And yet, the work we do is too important. 
I often use humor as a way to cope with my mental health and not take things seriously, which makes writing a satire column during the semester I was most depressed even more ironic, but I am exhausted. I am tired of pretending I am OK when I am not. I refuse to keep running away from my feelings and thoughts by mindlessly distracting myself with work. Most importantly, I remain hopeful that it is possible to be a journalist and put your mental health first and that there is a way forward without burnout. 
Reflecting on my time as a student journalist, I sometimes wonder why I stayed as long as I did. It’s hard to explain to my friends and non-journalists why everyone in the newsroom commits to spending five days a week and multiple hours a day putting together each new issue. While I can’t speak for others, for me, it is the service we provide to our audiences; the stories we are able to share and the impact our work has. 
Even all these semesters later, I collect each issue with an article written by yours truly because there is something special about seeing something I wrote in print. There is a privilege in being able to immortalize my words that will be around long after I am gone and knowing that, through these words, I was able to share someone else’s story. Writing has always been my way of communicating and sharing pieces of myself with the world, and DT gave me the platform to do that during my time at USC.
The past four years and my time as a student journalist have included both ups and downs, but they have furthered my commitment to being a storyteller and using both journalism and film to keep telling stories of myself, other people and our world. As my time at DT and USC comes to a bittersweet end, I am eager to keep asking more questions and seeking solutions at Columbia Journalism School in the fall, while continuing to pursue what I love.

In 1890, spurred by ongoing union strikes demanding better working conditions, the United States government started tracking the amount of hours Americans worked during a typical week. The average number for a manufacturing employee was a whopping 100 hours — when tracking building tradesmen, the number went up to 102.
Even when armed with numbers like that, it would take the country another 36 years and the rise of Henry Ford before the eight-hour workday became the gold standard of the American labor market.
Yet now, it feels a bit like we’re living in a pre-Ford wasteland of our own. Prepandemic, Americans worked more hours than any comparable nation — having the 6th most average annual hours worked per worker in 2018. Postpandemic, when millions of jobs went remote, the average American’s workday actually increased by about one hour. The ongoing result has been an unprecedented number of resignations, as many as 39 million in just 10 months. About 39% of the people who quit their job last year cite “working too many hours” as a primary driver for their departure.
Any student who works a part-time job or spins a few dozen extra plates knows that 48 hours is not nearly enough time to accomplish all that is abandoned for the sake of their degree: housework, groceries, meeting up with friends we’ve already canceled on three times, replacing tires, doctor’s appointments. When exactly is this ever-evasive “day of rest” people keep talking about?
Now that California is officially considering the four-day workweek, a certain amount of celebratory fervor is expected. For the first time in nearly 100 years, our labor laws might be shifting with the wellbeing of the employee in the foreground.
The bill would only apply to private-sector companies with more than 500 employees. It would function as a trial run of sorts, similar to ones played out in Belgium and Iceland, both of which yielded hopeful results: Productivity remained high and the mental and emotional well-being of participating employees skyrocketed.
All that being said, the bill is still unlikely to pass. Already labeled a “job killer” by the California Chamber of Commerce, economists and executives alike are extremely skeptical of the proposed 32-hour workweek. Some fear it will discourage pay raises, while others insist that shorter workweeks do not actually increase employment, thus extending the effects of The Great Resignation.
When Ford announced his company’s adoption of a five-day workweek in 1926, he wrote, “Just as the eight-hour day opened our way to prosperity in America, so the five-day workweek will open our way to still greater prosperity … It is high time to rid ourselves of the notion that leisure for workmen is either lost time or a class privilege.”
Nothing is the same as it was in 1926. There’s an eight-year-old somewhere using an iPad to play Wordle while lounging on a Purple Mattress bought with Honey’s 10% discount code. Refusing to update labor laws for fear of change is to deny that change has already taken place. People’s relationship to their workplace has shifted; whether companies choose to adapt is up to their own discretion and, possibly, detriment.
If the American worker’s tenacity is still being called into question, and our yearning for a day of relaxation scoffed at, it begs the question: If, after facing the Second World War, the Civil Rights Movement, the threat of nuclear warfare, two devastating recessions, an ongoing climate crisis and global pandemic, we are still unqualified for a little rest and repose, at what point will we have sufficiently earned it?

California Pizza Kitchen’s Tostada Pizza is one of the few perfect foods. In a world of culinary fusion and innovation, this pizza shines in its ability to highlight the most exciting aspects of several cuisines and cultures.
CPK’s hand-tossed pizza dough is layered generously with black beans and Monterey Jack cheese, baked to perfection. As soon as it’s pulled out of the oven, the decadent pizza is topped with a fresh mix of lettuce and tostada strips and drizzled with their tangy ranch. This showstopper is served with a side of their fire-roasted salsa, and any CPK fanatic knows to ask for extra. 
I’ve heard plenty of CPK’s haters claim that the Tostada Pizza does not live up to my exaltations, but to me, what makes this pizza more delicious than the sum of its parts is the memories in every bite.
From birthdays to graduations to reunions, I’ve celebrated nearly every one of my life’s milestones by sharing a Tostada Pizza with my family and friends. In a sense, this pizza has become my very own ritual — a way to reflect on all of life’s ups and downs.
I’m well aware that CPK is no Michelin-star restaurant, but my obsession has less to do with the food and more to do with the feeling of community and belonging the restaurant offers me. Walking into CPK brings me familiarity and comfort — something that has value beyond Yelp reviews.
Society has become accustomed to accepting the judgment of those in power as to what is objectively good. Something is good not because it brings us joy but because of its ratings from others. 
We spend our time eating at restaurants commended by the James Beard Awards or watching the movies nominated for an Oscar because we have more faith in what other people think is good than in our own judgment.
Rather than enjoying the things we like, we obsess over the things that are considered worthwhile. In our society, something must be objectively good or bad, but we forget that good is a personal metric.
The idea of good is inherently corrupted by the systems we live under. In a society infected with racism, classism, sexism and ableism, our biases seep into every judgment we pass. There is no way to decide what is universally revered without our prejudice tainting that supposedly objective claim.
Chain restaurants are often more accessible to lower-class folks because their high-efficiency supply chains make for more reasonable prices. These familiar franchises offer a space to celebrate in community without breaking the bank.
To culinary experts and foodies, it’s inconceivable that a chain restaurant could bring something valuable to the culinary world. That opinion itself holds roots in a classist perspective that insists the joys of lower class folks must inherently be less valuable.
We classify some pleasures as guilty because we’re shocked that people find meaning in things society has deemed meaningless. Once we realize the way society assigns value is poisoned by bigotry, we can stop looking down upon people who enjoy “bad” things. We can accept that pleasure is pleasure, regardless of critical acclaim.
The frameworks we live under may not create a place for praise of the things you love, but that doesn’t mean they’re any less worthy of your appreciation. If you enjoy squeezing ketchup on your mac and cheese or reading romance novels, there is no reason to allow our society to convince you that you’re finding joy in the wrong things.
Based on my favorite CPK’s 3.5-star Yelp average, the verdict on whether the chain is actually good appears to be mixed. Luckily for me, food is everything but objective. Food is made of love, community and care, each of which are personal.
Eating is a biological need, but finding happiness in food is an emotional necessity. Finding that happiness in CPK’s Tostada Pizza may not be a universal experience, but what matters most is what it means to me.
The Tostada Pizza is the place I go during this roller coaster of a life to find peace and nourishment, one bite at a time. 
Life’s too short for us to deny ourselves the things that make every moment worth experiencing.

Last week, I wrote a poem called “Meditations & Jubilee” as part of my senior poetry sequence, an exploration of my own psychology and dreams. The poem concludes with the line, “Through meditation, form // your own concept of jubilee. Consider it a blessing that He is all you have when everyone else leaves.” 
I rarely talk about my creative work, but I would not quote my poetry if it had no relevance to my final column. That’s right, you read that right: This is the concluding chapter of “The Eck’s Factor.” Before I continue, I’ll let my biggest critics have their moment so they can rejoice. 
My poem epitomizes my reckoning with a part of me that my column has guided over the past two years. And now that it has come to an end, I cannot help but contemplate its impact and how I can move onto new pastures with everything I learned and taught myself.  
My involvement with the Daily Trojan dates back to a period in my education shortly after I visited a career counselor and a new major adviser every week. Dornsife advising, my heart goes out to you for tolerating my weekly identity crises. 
I was a neuroscience major, fully immersed in pre-medicine coursework and constantly surrounded by aspiring healthcare providers. I had a love-hate relationship with science, and I would be lying if I didn’t say that I was terribly unhappy the first two years of my undergraduate studies. 
When I joined the Daily Trojan, however, I thought I could maybe find a creative outlet beyond my science courses. Little did I know that writing opinion editorials would respawn my love for writing and lead to adding a creative writing major and becoming opinion editor at the Daily Trojan.  
I started my column in Spring 2019, naive to the storm ahead. I was infatuated with giving my “hot takes” on hot button, sociopolitical issues — typical Aries of me — without having to only focus on topics relevant to USC. I went from writing editorials about the University’s STI-testing policies to practically anything I wanted. I wrote about Penn Badgley in “You” and our societal glamorization of sociopathy. I wrote about dating apps, Chick-fil-A, climate alarmism and psychedelics. 
One of my favorite pieces to this day is one titled, “Hypercompetitive pre-health culture is not conducive to fostering compassionate physicians,” an exposé of my experiences as a pre-medicine student in a culture that prioritizes grades at the expense of human decency. This article is still my guiding pedagogy, as I apply to medical school this upcoming cycle. 
Then the pandemic hit, and we were sent home for what we thought would be a week, which turned into one and a half years. Black Lives Matter became ever so salient following white former police officer Derek Chauvin’s murder of George Floyd. 
I suddenly found myself in isolation and at the forefront of controversy with warranted and unwarranted opinions to my left and right. But I also had an immense amount of privilege. I had a roof over my head; I was physically healthy and I had a biweekly slot in a newspaper that circulated to more than 50,000 readers. I realized that I was no longer just here to share my hot takes about the most recent Twitter feud. 
I had a voice and a platform that I could use to disseminate my perspective without feeding into racist narratives. But as a white man, to what extent would this perspective contribute to an anti-racist movement without also shedding performativism or a white savior complex? I had to reckon with this issue by learning how to best communicate an opinion that would be both accessible and receivable. 
Through all 32 editions, “The Eck’s Factor” provided an outlet for me to foster discourse among a community I deeply care about. It was not only a catharsis anymore but a form of engagement. I simply cannot talk about the tens of thousands of words that I poured into these articles without acknowledging the things I discovered about the people around me. 
I initially thought I could use the outlet to share my opinion and possibly change a few minds along the way. Throughout the journey, however, I realized that my audience would not be that malleable. Of course, it was always such a huge compliment whenever anyone would randomly approach me and say they loved my article, but that wasn’t always the case. Journalism unexpectedly cultivated my conflict-resolution skills. 
The Daily Trojan was catalytic to my college experience. It paralleled the relationships I lost and the relationships I formed. It mirrored my development of communication skills that I could use to create accessible content. It helped me find a political mindset where I felt knowledgeable enough to engage in conversations with others but also cognizant enough of my own knowledge gaps that required more learning, more research, more discovery. 
Upon its conclusion, I feel satisfied with what I accomplished. “The Eck’s Factor” ends at a time where my passions are shifting to newer things. I am no longer the lost sophomore with an opinion or two but a soon-to-be alumnus with a road ahead of me. Freelance writing will forever be a possibility for me, but in the meantime, I will continue looking for a jubilee elsewhere.

What a year it’s been for basketball. Joel Embiid became the first center to lead the league in scoring since Shaquille O’Neal, Chris Paul helped yet another franchise set their win record and the Los Angeles Lakers set a new low for preseason betting favorites. I’ve had a lot of fun covering it all, and I’m happy to sign off with my last column of the semester. Let’s get to it.
The Mavericks and Jazz throw a couple of haymakers
When the Dallas Mavericks announced the absence of superstar guard Luka Doncic in the first three games of their first-round series against the Utah Jazz, expectations were grim. The Mavs had gone 2-2 in their last four regular season games against the Jazz, but both wins were won with the strength of sterling Doncic performances. An opening game loss seemed to confirm these fears, but the Mavs appeared far from finished.
Spearheaded by fourth-year guard Jalen Brunson, the Mavs swept by the Jazz in games two and three by 6 and 8 points, respectively. With Doncic cleared for game four, the Mavs seemed poised to take a commanding 3-1 lead. The Jazz had other ideas. A game-winning alley-oop orchestrated by Utah’s two stars locked the series at 2-2 as it shifts back to Dallas.
DeRozan’s playoff struggles
What happens to Chicago Bulls guard Demar DeRozan when the calendar hits April and the NBA playoffs begin? For much of the former Trojan’s career, we’ve seen his stats take a hit when the going gets tough. He’s never had a season shooting a higher percentage in the playoffs than the regular season. 
As the leading star for teams in Toronto, San Antonio and Chicago, DeRozan is yet to reach the Finals. On the brink of elimination from the playoffs again, the Bulls guard has struggled to produce in the teams’ losses. He’s gone 18-54 from the field in those games, including an uninspiring 0-7 line on threes. If Chicago wants any chance of making their series competitive after back-to-back blowouts, they’ll need DeRozan back at his best.
The Warriors’ Death Lineup 3.0
Watch out, West Coast. The Golden State Warriors have unlocked the third iteration of their iconic “death lineup” thanks to the scorching shooting of young guard Jordan Poole. The first death lineup included Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Draymond Green, Kevin Durant and Andre Iguodala. Despite not having a player taller than 6’10”, this lineup blitzed the league’s best from its first appearance in the 2015 Finals. 
The second death lineup was the so-called “Hamptons Five.” This group substituted former MVP small forward Kevin Durant for Harrison Barnes to devastating effect. Back-to-back championships followed as the team went 32-6 in postseason play in the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons.
With Durant’s departure, the death lineups seemed lost forever. Former Michigan guard Jordan Poole has resurrected the death lineup, forming a potent five that has a 3-1 lead against the Denver Nuggets in their first round series. An official name is still forthcoming, but my personal favorite is calling this the “Poole Party” lineup.
Boston’s D is not here to mess around
The Brooklyn Nets came out of the play-in tourney riding high, sweeping past the Cleveland Cavaliers 115-108. Unfortunately for the team, they ran straight into the buzzsaw known as the Boston Celtics defense. Through games one and two, the Celtics held the Nets to the lowest shot quality mark in the playoffs, a paltry 46.8%. That would be, by far, the worst percentage in the league during the regular season.
Kevin Durant looks as if he’s starring in “Thunderstruck” (2012) again, shooting at a 39.4% clip on the series. Point guard Kyrie Irving hasn’t fared much better, posting a 43% mark on the series. Even a return from missing point guard Ben Simmons wouldn’t have saved these Nets, unless Simmons had taken a page or two out of Steph Curry’s book over the last year. 
It’s too early to call this era of Brooklyn basketball a flop but lose a few more playoff series, and it wouldn’t be the worst adjective for it. 
With that, I’ll sign off for the semester. Keep hooping, stay froody and have a great summer.
