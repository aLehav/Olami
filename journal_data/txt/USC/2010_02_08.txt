Undergraduate Student Government presidential and vice presidential candidates Dylan Dann and Addison McCaleb are hoping to help students get connected, whether it’s to one another, to important resources or to the city around them.

Donning bright green T-shirts during the campaign period to make their names, faces and ideas known, Dann and McCaleb are running on a platform, which includes facilitating communication among students and giving students access to destinations around Los Angeles. The two are hoping, as their slogan says, to “Connect (you) SC.”
“The Trojan experience has just been one of a kind for me, and I really wanted to give back. I’ve been involved in USG and realized that students need to be connected to the university more than they are now,” Dann said.
If elected president, Dann, a junior majoring in international relations (global business) and a member of Sigma Chi fraternity, said he will draw on his experience as a Greek senator and lead with a passion he feels is unmatched.
“Our greatest strength … is passion,” Dann said. “You’ve really got to want to fix this university, make it better, make it the best that it can be … We really want to improve the university for the next generation of Trojans, and I think that’s what sets us apart. The passion and vigor with which we’re going to go into this office if elected would be better than the next candidate.”
McCaleb, a junior majoring in film production and a member of Sigma Nu fraternity, ran for a Greek senator seat last year but lost to Dann. He said he wants to bring a “fresh perspective” to the USG administration. Dann, the two maintain, will provide the experience, and McCaleb will bring an outsider’s idealist approach.
“Why we love the duo of us two is that I kind of bring the fresh perspective,” McCaleb said. “I’m walking in there, guns blazing. Maybe I don’t know all the rules and maybe I don’t know everything that’s been addressed or attempted to be addressed, but maybe that’s a positive.”
If elected, Dann and McCaleb’s goals include regular meetings with representatives from student groups, USC shuttles around the city (including to the beach, the Grove and airports), assistance for students looking for non-university housing, permanent USC e-mail addresses, football tickets that are transferable by I.D. card and improved wireless internet around campus. All of these initiatives, they say, come back to connectivity.
In particular, the two assert that it is important for USG to facilitate connections among student organizations.
“We feel like there are so many organizations at USC that aren’t connected, and a lot of them do the same projects or work on the same things, have common goals, so we really want to connect those organizations to one another so they can work together if they want to,” Dann said.
Dann and McCaleb hope to facilitate communication between students and USG and among students and student groups. They plan to hold monthly meetings with student leaders — a variation on this year’s Council of Presidents — to give student groups a chance to voice their concerns and ask questions.
“It wouldn’t be a meeting where we tell what we’re doing, but we ask them to tell us what they’re doing and how we can help,” McCaleb said.
The current USG administration set out initially to improve students’ knowledge of USG and its operation. That outreach effort, Dann said, was met with great success, and he hopes to continue to expand on it and to focus on face-to-face interaction more than online communication.
“The best connections really come from interactions between one another,” Dann said. “I think a lot of it has to do with USG’s tangible representation in different meetings, really representing organizations, and I think that’s where that’s going to come from.”
He also intends to continue the current administration’s work on initiatives including extended hours at the USC University Park Health Center and the Lyon Center and rollover dining dollars.
Their goals are lofty, but Dann and McCaleb said for every point of their platform, they carefully considered whether it was feasible and how much money it would cost. The two hope to take a careful look at how USG’s money is spent.
“In every issue we looked at, every time we wrote something down, we said, ‘Is this feasible?’ We didn’t want to make a whole campaign that in the end was a great campaign [but] we weren’t able to execute,” McCaleb said.
With the help of about 40 volunteers, according to campaign manager Lesley Stahl, and the continued use of bright colors, Dann and McCaleb are focusing, as their campaign slogan signifies, on connecting to students. This, they hope, will make them successful come voting period next week.
“I don’t see any barriers between us,” McCaleb said. “I am going to continue being the student I’ve been for three years and just take on extra responsibilities for them.”

Amid the worst drop in private donations to universities in more than 50 years, USC has emerged relatively unscathed, placing seventh on the list of top fundraising universities in the country despite a reduction in giving.
An annual survey by the Council for Aid to Education found that the recession has hit university donors’ pocketbooks — private donations to American universities fell by 11.9 percent this year, the highest decline in the survey’s 53-year history.
At USC, donations dropped only 9.8 percent. The school received $368,981,377 in 2009, earning it the seventh-place spot.
“During tough times, the Trojan family is willing to reach out,” said Courtney Surls, vice president of USC development. “That says a lot about how dedicated the Trojan family is to the success of the university.”
The survey found that personal donations experienced the steepest decline, with alumni donations down 18 percent.
At USC however, the number of people donating actually increased, though the total amount of the donations declined. For alumni, parents and friends, the number of gifts given in 2009 increased by .05 percent while the number of gifts given specifically by alumni increased by 1.32 percent.
Scott Mory, CEO of the USC Alumni Association, said alumni support has been consistent.
“At the end of the day, USC has an extraordinarily loyal alumni base, and the university is doing amazing things that alumni want to be a part of,” he said.
Donations, the majority of which come from individuals, are used to sponsor a range of university programs like scholarships, research, athletics and campus life. About 62 percent of the donations’ yield goes to expenditures like scholarships and research, 23 percent goes to buildings and renovation and the rest goes to the endowment.
Robert Abeles, interim senior vice president and chief financial officer, said the amount budgeted based on gifts is different from the actual amount of donations because the money is not all spent immediately. He said the impact of the decline in gifts, which currently account for 8.4 percent of the budget, is small.
“[The] decline is about $6 million, so that is not significant when you’re looking at a budget of approximately $2.7 billion.”
Surls echoed this.
“USC’s operations are funded by a variety of sources,” she said. “In general, a decrease in gifts might limit opportunities to fund new initiatives, [but] it’s not a noticeable change.”
Surls also added that, while the survey indicates a decline in donations, the overall trend is upward. She said that there are fluctuations in gifts every year, so it is important to look at the trend in donations over a period of time to get a real sense of how the university is doing.
“You can’t look too much from year to year,” Surls said. “You really have to look at these numbers over a period of years, and we are steadily always increasing.”
Historically, Surls said, it has held that, as the United States comes out of a recession, donations return at higher levels than it was at before the recession. Still, donors will have to gain confidence in external economic factors like the stock market and gross domestic product before donations rebound to previous levels.
“Realistically, when the economy is down, there’s a psychological impact. It’s going to take some confidence in the economy before we see the levels we’re used to,” she said.

The USC Board of Trustees recently passed six resolutions aimed at enhancing sustainability on campus, though some students question how effective the broad resolutions will be.
On Jan. 27, the Campus Planning Committee of the Board of Trustees passed these resolutions to reinforce USC’s plan to maintain a sustainable campus in terms of environmental degradation, energy conservation, water conservation, waste reduction and building construction. Though the resolutions call for improvement in these areas, they do not specify methods or timelines.
Matthew Oden, manager of the sustainability program, said the resolutions will help focus the university’s sustainability efforts and set guidelines for future developments on campus.
“The university in many ways is already fulfilling these resolutions, but [the resolutions] put the university in a position to be more aggressive in some of the areas and to give a clearer understanding of a policy basis that will implement new ideas and fresh thinking,” Oden said.
The resolutions, Oden said, will help USC build on the efforts that are already in place.
In accordance with the resolutions, the new Ronald Tutor Campus Center, which is currently scheduled to open in August of this year, will be the first building at USC to be LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified.  Additionally, USC is encouraging students and faculty to use alternative forms of transportation that will limit emissions and to be mindful of turning off lights and office equipment.
Many sustainability experts at USC find the resolutions to be a good beginning to reaching the university’s ultimate goals.
“They’re not really that broad based in terms of trying to change, but they’re well-defined goals that USC can meet,” said Lisa Schweitzer, an assistant professor in the School of Policy, Planning and Development.
Mark Bernstein, managing director of the USC Energy Institute, agreed USC is headed in the right direction.
“These resolutions show great interest to look toward the future of the university. Although they are just big goals, what will work will be the operational plans that are implemented to meet these goals,” he said.
Perhaps because the resolutions only establish an outline of the university’s plans, some students question whether they will be effective.
Matt Herrick, a freshman majoring in communication, said he is skeptical that the resolutions will be beneficial without strict enforcement.
“[The resolutions] sound pretty good, but I just don’t see how [the university] can enforce some of these rules in the dorms … USC should take a direct initiative to target students to make it more personal so people can see the direct effects,” Herrick said.
Herrick mentioned placing a limit on showering to restrict water usage as an example to show students the importance of water conservation.
Another student, Melinda Amato, a sophomore majoring in sociology, said she agrees with Herrick that there is more USC can do to improve the school’s sustainability.
“We haven’t done as much as other universities have in terms of sustainability. I’ve heard of some colleges that allow students to bring Tupperware into the dining halls to not waste as much food,” Amato said.  “We still haven’t really explored the whole realm of options to improve our sustainability.”
Mapaul Espina, a junior majoring in computer science, said he thinks the resolutions solidify USC’s commitment to going green.
“[These resolutions] are good news as long as the students and faculty play an important role,” Espina said. “To do this, we need to let the everyone know that USC is going green.”
Oden noted that these resolutions are not USC’s first steps toward becoming a greener campus.
He said that USC already has a waste diversion rate of 54 percent, which Oden said is good given the circumstances.
“The diversion rate measures all of the trash that leaves the university and is recycled. The recycling rate is actually really high, but none of the trash that is picked from the trash cans actually ‘leaves’ the university,” Oden said.  “On paper, it might appear that the recycling rate doesn’t look that good, but realistically we are a leader.”
Oden said USC also has one of the most advanced water conservation systems in terms of measuring the saturation of the soil. Drip irrigation is used only when and where it is needed. In addition, the majority of the plants and shrubs seen around campus are drought resistant, with the exception of certain ornamental areas, he said.

After the New Orleans Saints’ 31-17 victory in the Super Bowl on Sunday, three former Trojans joined a long list of ex-USC football players with Super Bowl victories on their résumés.
Awards · Former USC running back Reggie Bush became one of only three players to win a Heisman, NCAA title and a Super Bowl ring.  - Daily Trojan file photo 
Former USC star and current New Orleans Saints running back Reggie Bush had the biggest impact on the game among the cast of ex-USC players, as he contributed 63 total yards from scrimmage, 38 of which were receiving.
Also responsible for returning punts for the Saints, Bush only had two kicked his way, one of which he fair-caught at the New Orleans’ 28-yard line and another which he was only able to return four yards.
Bush joins an exclusive group with the Saints’ Super Bowl victory, as he becomes just the third player to ever win a Heisman Trophy, a college football national championship and a Vince Lombardi Trophy.
One of the other two members of the club is another former USC running back Marcus Allen, who was a part of the 1978 national champion Trojans, won the Heisman Trophy in 1981 and won a Super Bowl with the Los Angeles Raiders in 1984. Allen was also the MVP of Oakland’s 38-9 victory over the Washington Redskins in  Super Bowl XVIII.
The Saints picked Bush second overall in the 2006 NFL Draft, and, while the running back has been widely considered a bust in the professional ranks, his performance in the divisional round of the NFC playoffs helped the Saints make their way through the NFL’s postseason.
The Saints also featured a former Trojan on defense, as defensive lineman Sedrick Ellis also played a key role in the game, recording three tackles — one for a loss — against the explosive Indianapolis Colts offense.
With the Colts threatening to score to bring the game within seven points with under two minutes to play, Ellis broke through the Colts’ offensive line on third and goal to help take down Colts running back Joseph Addai for a two-yard loss.  On fourth and goal, Colts quarterback Peyton Manning threw an incomplete pass, sealing the Saints’ victory.
On the season, the Saints’ rookie had 34 total tackles and two sacks in limited playing time on New Orleans’ defensive line.
Tight end Billy Miller — who played for the Trojans during the late 1990s — was on the injured reserve for the Saints but he will likely still receive a Super Bowl ring for the victory.
Indianapolis defensive lineman Fili Moala, the only former Trojan on the AFC champion Colts, was ruled inactive for the game after being out of action for the entire AFC playoffs.

So another Super Bowl Sunday has passed, leaving multitudes of football fans scratching their heads as to what to do on weekends. But don’t be fooled, the Super Bowl isn’t just about football — it’s a business as much as anything else. The fact that it has an average viewership of 80 to 90 million people globally at any given time during its telecast means that the event is a perfect stage for advertising of anything and everything.
Particularly in the modern era of the Super Bowl, advertisements have become ritualistic. We all know that these cream-of-the-crop commercials are coming, and, as a tribute to our insatiable consumerist appetites, we anticipate them year after year. Corporations know this too, which is why companies such as Coca-Cola are willing to dish up $2.8 million for a single 30-second spot.
More fascinating, however, is the approach each organization takes with its precious on-air time. Will it choose to be amusing in a classy way or attempt to start a comedic riot amongst viewers? Will it be severe, sincere, light-hearted or bizarre?
The trend seems biased toward the comedic. USA Today’s Super Bowl Ad Meter — a ranking based on the surveys of various focus groups across the nation — listed Mars Inc.’s Snickers ad to be the favorite of this year’s batch.
This marked a somewhat triumphant return for the brand after its 2007 fiasco in which a Snickers ad was deemed homophobic and was pulled off air because of protests. This year’s commercial featured octogenarian actors Betty White and Abe Vigoda playing a game of full-contact football to little success. The twist, cleverly enough, came when Betty was offered a Snickers bar by a woman who appeared to be her girlfriend, revitalizing her back into the original form of a young man. The final shot showed the quarterback exhaustedly appearing as Abe Vigoda after being sacked, confirming once again that old people in unfamiliar contexts are always hilarious.
Other commercials followed this humorous route. Doritos brought a strong selection of ads, made all the more interesting by the fact that they were all finalists of the company’s annual amateur ad competition “Crash the Superbowl.”
Anheuser-Busch, as always, had various spots promoting both Budweiser and Bud Light. A Budweiser ad featured its logo’s Clydesdale horse displayed as developing a relationship with a longhorn steer.
Unsurprisingly, this year’s incarnation of the Clydesdale theme was no less bewildering than that of prior years, which begs the question: What does this have to do with beer?
The ads for Bud Light were slightly more conventional, although Anheuser-Busch’s intrinsic propensity for weirdness was not completely abolished as one ad featured a group of guys talking to each other on the phone in Auto-Tuned voices (not surprisingly, T-Pain makes a cameo at the end).
Turning up the bizarreness was Boost Mobile, which celebrated the 25th Anniversary of the Chicago Bears’ “Super Bowl Shuffle” by getting the team’s former players back in their uniforms and having them grind around on a stage with geriatric props.
Equally perplexing was Denny’s ad, which featured egg-laying chickens screaming in fear of Free Grand Slam Day.
And another contender for the weirdness trophy was truTV’s commercial, which showed Troy Polamalu (of USC and Steelers fame) as the Punxsutawney groundhog.
If that was strange, the outright champion of insanity was Diamond Foods, which promoted both Emerald Nuts and Pop Secret popcorn in a commercial that upped the ante for ads that feature freakish, polyester-clad aquatic ringleaders and humans acting like dolphins at Sea World — a combination that likely left millions of Americans gaping at the tagline “Awesome + Awesome = Awesomer” (with the inference that Pop Secret and Emerald Nuts = Awesomer).
Arguably, though, the best commercials in terms of sheer execution were the ones that didn’t succumb to cheap laughs. Pepsi-Cola (though expected to) did not buy any ad time, marking its their first opt-out in a 23-year streak of Super Bowl advertisements. Coca-Cola took full advantage of this with two well-crafted commercials in an abstract, minimalist style.
The first, titled “Hard Times,” shows a bankrupt Montgomery Burns being cheered up with a Coke in heartwarming fashion, while the second, titled “Sleepwalker,” features a man walking across a hazard-laden African savannah in search of a refreshing, late-night Coca-Cola.
Coke has had tremendous success with its past advertisements — the latter commercial placed fourth in the rankings this year — which seems to corroborate findings that vague advertisements fare better with consumers than those that advertise their products explicitly.
If vagueness is a consideration, no ad fit the bill better than Focus on the Family’s controversial commercial featuring Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother, Pam.
The ad — part of the organization’s pro-life agenda — created a storm of pre-airing protest from women’s rights groups and pro-choice organizations, which might have led one to believe that the commercial was going to be more blatantly offensive. The actual result was much less interesting. It just showed Pam speaking in thinly veiled terms of how Tim was almost never born, alluding to the pre-birth circumstances in which many doctors recommended an abortion for the mother’s own health. This was followed by Tim tackling her and the both of them popping back up, smiling like a perfect duo. The tameness of the ad itself probably made it more successful than anything else, as there was little evidence of the group’s supposed extreme right-wing values.
When the Super Bowl ended though, there were two ads on a different level than the rest. First was the NFL’s own advertisement thanking the “Best Fans on the Planet.” Fitting for the game’s conclusion, the ad showed USC’s own Reggie Bush in breathtaking slow motion approaching the goal line to the classic countdown of a NASA takeoff and hurdling over a Miami defender. Words cannot express how well this commercial was produced, as the Arcade Fire’s chillingly epic “Wake Up” plays to the ecstatic cheering of fans, all in the same gorgeous slow motion.
The second stand-out ad was Google’s amazingly simple “Parisian Love.” In a single 30-second clip, the one company that needs no advertising poignantly stayed true to the pure simplicity of its search engine by following a man’s journey from a simple trip to Paris, to his meeting a Parisian girl, to their wedding, to the start of a family — all through the viewpoint of the Google searches he used.
It reaffirmed what people already know about Google but also told a story, which is a point that so many ads fall short on.
Both this and the NFL’s commercial achieved not only greater prominence for their respective organizations but took the medium of video advertisement to its greatest potential. They didn’t just try to promote a company or a product through silliness or sex or expensive effects. These commercials practically shattered the barrier between business and art. Google and the NFL, more so than any other organization, made ads truly worth the $2.8 million they cost and simultaneously raised the bar for next year’s Super Bowl.
It’s going to be another long 12 months before we see if any more companies can reach the heights of art while being tethered to the needs of a consumer society.
[…] So another Super Bowl Sunday has passed, leaving multitudes of football fans scratching their heads as to what to do on weekends. But don’t be fooled, the Super Bowl isn’t just about football — it’s a business as much as anything else. The …   Read more here… […]

When popular music first turned to Tin Pan Alley songs of the 1920s, it was led by songwriting greats such as George and Ira Gershwin composing and penning, respectively, heartfelt ballads like “Someone to Watch Over Me” and “Embraceable You.” They were hopeful, elegant and dripping with uninhibited emotion.
This tradition of the love ballad carried out through several decades, turning more upbeat with ’50s crooners like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin and pop-rock driven with more recent musicians like Sting and Rod Stewart. 
Yet somewhere between the ’80s and now marks the death of the love song. Perhaps it was the switch from soul and blues to dance-influenced popular music that did it in. Or maybe it was Madonna’s provocative hits that screamed women’s sexual liberation in the face of Ronald Reagan’s conservatism that turned the tide.
Whatever the reason, the closest we get to love nowadays is either T-Pain’s “I’m N Luv (Wit a Stripper)” or contrived vampire melodramas. Lady Gaga sings about being beautiful and rich, Taylor Swift aches with sugar-coated pain and even the alternative Kings of Leon have resorted to crafting songs around the motivation of going through with a one-night stand.
But if you dig deep enough into the realm of indie pretension, you’ll find tunes — whether optimistic, ironic or downright forlorn — that still have a trace of warmth and power to engage the listener in a semblance of a feeling.
Just in time for Valentine’s Day, I’ve delved into that realm of indie pretension and compiled a list of songs that embody the complexity, fragility and overall quirkiness of modern love. None are traditional ballads or overly weepy in sentiment but, instead, explore facets of the ambivalence most of us feel toward that four-letter word today. In the words of John Cusak’s Rob from High Fidelity: “The making of a great compilation tape — like breaking up — is hard to do and takes ages longer than it might seem.”
Yeah Yeah Yeahs — “Maps”
The quintessential indie love ballad from the most unexpected alternative band, “Maps” offers a glimpse into these eclectic New Yorkers’ hearts as vocalist Karen O strains to get out the words, Wait, they don’t love you like I love you.
The Magnetic Fields — “The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure”
The members of The Magnetic Fields might claim not to know anything about love on “The Death of Ferdinand de Saussure,” but they do know they are nothing without it. With its sprite, toe-tapping melody, “Ferdinand de Saussure” will convince you to just accept what you know and go along with the flow.
She & Him — “I Was Made For You”
Zooey Deschanel, the “she” to M. Ward’s “him,” emulates ’60s girl-group pop on this sunny track from the pair’s debut album, Volume 1. Like much of the album, Deschanel ditches cynicism and keeps it positive as she finds a dream come true while taking a walk. Backed by airy vocals and a bouncy drumbeat, it’s a pleasant pop throw-back.
The Smiths — “There Is A Light That Never Goes Out”
Although (500) Days of Summer revived The Smith’s popularity last year, for the angst-ridden teens hanging out in dive bars in the late 1980s, Steven Patrick Morrissey and company were the leaders among the despondent and broken-hearted. Moz is still sad on this one, but he’s found a dark, kindred spirit to take him out tonight as he wails, If a double-decker bus crashes into us / To die by your side is such a heavenly way to die. Welcome to the genesis of emo culture.
The Dandy Warhols — “Bohemian Like You”
This is a song about falling in love with a girl that has a great car, is in a band and waits tables. With its endless refrain of I like you, it’s hard to play “Bohemian Like You” and not get the message across.
PJ Harvey — “This Is Love”
The guitars are harsh and gritty on the emotionally charged “This Is Love,” as expected from the indie-rock queen. But when the usually disenchanted Harvey sings, I can’t believe that life’s so complex / When I just want to sit here and watch you undress, and howls with raw power, This is love / This is love that I’m feeling, it makes one stop and wonder: Wait, is Polly Jean finally in love? It sounds that way, until Harvey tosses in a dirty little secret during the song’s bridge. End result: You’ll need a shower after this one.
Elliott Smith — “Twilight”
The tale Elliott Smith weaves in “Twilight” — one of finding love and losing it — is bittersweet. Armed with nothing but his acoustic guitar and a backing track of chirping birds, Smith creates a wave of emotion as ambivalent as the coming of twilight as he croons, I could make you smile / If you stayed awhile / But how long will you stay with me, baby?
Au Pairs — “We’re So Cool”
Frontwoman Lesley Woods of the British post-punk outfit Au Pairs singlehandedly lead the Riot Grrrl movement more than a decade before the movement was actually recognized with her gender-bending lyrics and outspoken feminism. Over the scratchy guitars on “We’re So Cool,” Woods is again ahead of her time, delivering an anthem for those who live by the church of casual dating and open relationships.
Guillemots — “Made-Up Lovesong #43”
The avant-garde pop group’s “Made-Up Lovesong #43” is a melodramatic yet never over-the-top proclamation of love, complete with escalating orchestration and lead singer Fyfe Dangerfield’s soaring vocal range. The feeling might be unrequited (I love you, I don’t think you care), but the zeal behind Dangerfield’s voice isn’t.
Velvet Underground — “I’ll Be Your Mirror”
The ever-pleasing Nico might as well be reciting John Keats’ poetry on V.U.’s “I’ll Be Your Mirror,” which is possibly the most traditionally romantic song on this list. Crafted out of lovely metaphors of the wind, the rain and the sunsets and light on your door over fluid guitars and the wisps of tambourines, “I’ll Be Your Mirror” expresses what it means to have a solid, lasting connection with someone.

While most L.A. 20-somethings spent this Sunday holed up in their living rooms blazing through cases of beer while watching the New Orleans Saints take this year’s Super Bowl title, a little more than 200 music-savvy Angelenos gathered at The Strange on Melrose Avenue for a jam-packed day of underground — and not-so-underground — music, all in the name of cancer awareness.
Lo-fi heaven · Brooklyn-based Vivian Girls headlined the “No Cancer!” benefit show. 
The sold-out event, concisely named “No Cancer!” hoped to raise money for Irene Garcia, the mother of a prominent L.A. scenester who was recently diagnosed with what an event volunteer would only call “an extremely rare form of cancer.” All proceeds from the daylong festival — including ticket revenues and merchandise sales — went directly to the cause.
Organized by local indie promoting giant Sean Carlson and his team at FYF Fest, “No Cancer!” brought together an eclectic group of well-known and under-the-radar bands from Los Angeles and across the country, with acts hailing from New York and Texas performing over the course of the afternoon.
The event’s lineup read like a “Best Of” list of the lo-fi recording world. Included in the lineup were Los Angeles’ flagship noise band No Age, Brooklyn all-girl three-piece Vivian Girls, local buzz-worthy noise pop group Best Coast (fronted by ex-Pocahaunted member Bethany Cosentino), The Smell staple and longtime scene presence Abe Vigoda and local alt-country group, Darker My Love.
Initial audience response to “No Cancer!” was so enthusiastic that the event, originally scheduled to take place in an East Hollywood backyard, underwent three venue changes to accommodate all those who RSVP’d; unlucky audience hopefuls were turned away at the door but many remained on the sidewalk to peer through the glass doors and hear the music.
The festivities — fueled by free Colt 45 and inexpensive vegan hot dogs — began at noon with the L.A. punk outfit Animal Style, which, despite having only formed several months ago, has already played a handful of shows at The Smell and other famed local punk venues.
Local band Wounded Lion proved to be the most impressive underdog band on the “No Cancer!” bill with a tightly-knit performance encompassing noise rock, early punk and synth pop — not to mention an ambitiously executed noise pop cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Bad Moon Rising.”
Throughout the day, the set times were staggered so larger and more popular bands could play alongside some of the lineup’s less-established groups. Despite their early set times however, both Abe Vigoda and No Age played to a rowdy, mosh pit-loving crowd in the completely packed venue.
Although intimately connected with the L.A. do-it-yourself scene, No Age seemed the most out-of-place band after taking the stage. With a musical career extending back to their official formation in 2005, No Age’s performance was far more refined and dynamic than any of its peers on the “No Cancer!” bill — a rather strange quality to bestow upon a traditionally punk band.
The event, however, was not without its own set of pitfalls. Cosentino, the 23-year-old founder of the increasingly famous Best Coast, drank so much throughout the course of the day that, come performance time, she forgot how to play her songs and had to restart several times while apologizing profusely to the audience.
Once she gained her footing, the performance was disappointingly lackluster — especially after many in attendance had praised her musical abilities from her show at The Smell the night before.
Similarly, despite the lavender cancer awareness ribbons donned by the day’s audience and the cleverly designed posters festooning the venue (“No Age says NO to cancer,” “Abe Vigoda does NOT like cancer,” “Best Coast hates cancer”), numerous attendees commented on the show’s ironic activism; despite being an admittedly anti-cancer event, audience and band members alike could be seen crowding The Strange’s outdoor patio smoking cigarettes and drinking can after can of beer.
However, for all the lifestyle hypocrisy present at “No Cancer!”, the afternoon truly embodied the spirit of the L.A. underground DIY aesthetic — something that recent critics of the local music scene have prematurely labeled as on the down-and-out.
The bands voiced an open support for the event’s anti-cancer cause, rallying the audience to donate money to cancer research and expressing their happiness at seeing such a successful event.
Toward the end of No Age’s set, drummer and singer Dean Spunt noted that “everyone [at the show] has had a member of their family or known someone affected by cancer.”
“It’s really great to see everyone lending their support,” Spunt said.
Cosentino, too, shared similar sentiments during her performance.
“I really wanted to say that we are so happy to be involved in such a great event,” she said. “It’s amazing how many people are here, and we are really excited.”
Run entirely by volunteers and put together in less than two weeks by the organizers, “No Cancer!” proved that the L.A. music scene not only has one of the most extremely loyal followings in all of indiedom but can rally together support for a noble cause — all in the name of an afternoon of good music.
This event was not organized by Sean Carlson and FYF.
It was organized by a group of friends that rallied together to support a friends family.
Please get your information right.
Aside from that good article.

Less than a week ago, most people were praising Lane Kiffin’s recruiting tactics after, according to Rivals.com, he signed the No. 1 recruiting class in the nation. That praise may have been a bit premature.
It was reported Thursday that the new USC football coach spoke to 13-year-old star quarterback David Sills, a seventh-grade student at Red Lion Christian Academy in Bear, Del., about coming to Southern California to play college football in 2015. Kiffin offered Sills a scholarship, and the young teenager, a lifelong USC fan, verbally committed to sign with the Trojans after his high school graduation in five years. 
Nobody can blame Sills for committing. It has been his dream to play for the Trojans in the Coliseum since he was a little boy — a littler boy, that is. But Kiffin seems to have stepped outside his recruiting boundaries by reaching down to a middle school student-athlete, who should be more concerned with conquering Guitar Hero than committing to a college football program.
Kiffin first heard about the young phenom through his Southern California buddy Steve Clarkson. The quarterback guru, who was instrumental in developing big-time talent such as Ben Roethlisberger, Matt Cassel, Matt Leinart, Jimmy Clausen and Matt Barkley, told Kiffin that Sills was extremely special for his age.
“I first saw it with Jimmy Clausen. If there was a LeBron James in football, Jimmy Clausen would be the one. Then Matt Barkley was sort of second,” Clarkson said. “[Sills] is so unique. I thought he was the Tiger Woods of his position.”
Now, I don’t know how confident I would be in someone who compares Clausen to LeBron James (I also don’t think Tiger Woods references are the best ones to throw around these days). But Kiffin took Clarkson’s word and was impressed after watching footage of the seventh grader. The agreement took place when Sills called Kiffin Thursday evening.
On paper, it all looks great. Sills is projected to be 6-foot-5 with a strong build and currently possesses a power arm with precision accuracy. He’s got great footwork in the pocket, and apparently he’s already breaking down NFL defensive schemes — everything a coach could want in a seventh grader. And Kiffin played by the rules. All he did was offer a scholarship to a young kid at his dream school and ensure an early start on USC’s 2015 recruiting class.
But recruiting a kid that young does leave a sour taste in my mouth, and I hope this doesn’t start a nationwide trend among college football programs.
First of all, I think it’s impossible to project how a 13-year-old quarterback will play when he is 18, but that’s beside my point. Kids that young shouldn’t have to worry about the pressures of being approached by college recruiters or dealing with media coverage like that which has followed Sills since Thursday. They shouldn’t have to make a decision on where they want to play college football five years down the road or deal with the hype that is sure to follow Sills throughout his high school playing days and into college, whether he attends USC or not.
They also shouldn’t have to deal with the expectations that will be placed on a player like Sills in every football game he plays from here forward. If he throws an interception or makes a bad read, scrutiny is sure to follow.
USC hecklers resound nationwide.
Kids that young should only worry about one thing: being kids. Choosing a college destination is an adult decision. I had no idea where I wanted to attend college when I was 13 years old. In fact, I wasn’t even sure where I wanted to attend high school. I was more concerned about trying to get into an R-rated movie or finding a ride to my friend’s house. No life-changing decisions there. And that’s the way it should be.
My biggest fear is that Kiffin’s early-recruiting method might trickle down even further. Coaches are encouraged to track prospects beginning their junior year of high school. If Kiffin has reached all the way down to seventh grade however, who’s to say how young is too young? Are 12-year-olds too young to recruit? What about 10-year-olds? That tall 8-year-old looks promising.
Recruiting should be kept at the high school level not because it benefits the programs but because it benefits the kids. Young people should be able to enjoy an easygoing — carefree lifestyle as long as they can before it starts to slowly disappear as each year passes and responsibilities pile on.
If approached by a college recruiter, of course a 13-year-old teenager would be excited and want to commit, and coaches know that.
But a teenager should never be put in that situation. A 13-year-old boy or girl should be able to go out and have fun playing sports before being an athlete becomes a job.
Who knows what will happen in five years? Maybe Sills will officially sign with USC. Maybe he won’t. Maybe Lane Kiffin will still be coaching at USC. Maybe he won’t. And maybe football recruiters will understand they should leave kids alone. Then again, maybe they won’t.

Sophomore Jennifer Song and senior Belen Mozo tied a USC record as the No. 9 women’s golf team took the lead after the first day of the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.
Going it alone · Freshman Cyna Rodriguez is playing as an individual entrant at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge in Palos Verdes, Calif. Rodriguez shot a 3-over-par 74 in Monday’s first round action. - Photo courtesy of USC Sports Information 
Song shot a 4-under-par 67 to take the day-one lead, and Mozo followed with a 2-under 69 for her lowest round of the year. Both teammates tied a program record with their 12th career round in the 60s, tying the mark set by former USC golfer Irene Cho. The two All-Americans set the tone for a team looking for its second win of the season without much preparation.
Recent weather has altered the practice schedule of the team, as it prevented them from getting out on the course.
“The course is in fine shape considering all the rain, but we haven’t had a lot of time to play for the same reason,” USC coach Andrea Gaston said.
Song, in only her sixth competitive round for the team this season, posted her fifth score of 67 or below. With only one bogey on the eighth hole, Song tied for the individual lead with Duke’s Lindy Duncan.
“Eight was an easy up and down, but I was a little off there,” Song said.
Mozo started poorly, going 3-over through her first five holes. She bounced back with five birdies in the next 13 holes to post her first score in the 60s of the season. Mozo is tied for third and looks healthy despite the shoulder injury she battled throughout the fall.
“It’s one of those things I think she’s still getting used to, and there’s still some scar tissue, but she seems to be handling it real well,” Gaston said.
Junior Lizette Salas, the third All-American in the lineup this week, overcame a double bogey on the 13th to finish tied for seventh at 1-over 72. Salas, with eight career rounds in the 60s, may soon challenge for the scoring record herself.
Senior Caroline Kim finished tied for 34th at 5-over 76. She stood at even par through 11 holes, but a bogey on 12, double bogey on 13 and a bogey on 14 knocked her down the leaderboard.
Sophomore Inah Park tied for 49th with a 7-over 78. Consecutive birdies on 11 and 12 weren’t enough for Park to overcome the double bogeys on three and seven.
Taking full advantage of the location of the Challenge, the Women of Troy also entered freshman Cyna Rodriguez and senior Stefanie Endstrasser as individuals. Rodriguez finished in a tie for 21st with her 3-over 74. Endstrasser shot a 6-over 77 to finish tied for 39th.
The Women of Troy enter the second day of the challenge with an eight-stroke lead over No. 6 Duke. Play today begins at 8:30 a.m., in a shotgun format, as rain is expected.
“It could be arriving at about        1 [p.m.] tomorrow, so they’re trying to get us all out and get in 18 holes without too much rain,” Gaston said.
Though hoping to avoid the rain, the team is preparing for the worst.
“We’re going to take umbrellas and two pairs of shoes and gloves, so we can exchange them when they get wet,” Gaston said.
Barring any delays from the rain, the tournament finishes Wednesday.

Despite being married to an attractive older woman, Ashton Kutcher recently voiced a surprising opinion.
“I hate Valentine’s Day,” he said.
I couldn’t agree more. 
The rose bouquets, candlelight dinners and inevitable movie dates to see Dear John.
Barf.
But while a romantic trip to The Lab (or the 2-9) might be just enough to suit your date’s fancy, grand gestures of love are not exclusive to the world of celebrity. While Heidi Klum and hubby Seal may be exchanging cars during February’s love fest, the rest of the world will surely be indulging in much more scaled-down versions of society’s glorious, commercialized display of fine dining and chocolate truffles.
Perhaps some will take a note from pre-baby Angelina Jolie who  in 2000  showed her devotion to then-husband Billy Bob Thornton by wearing a vial of his blood as a necklace. Jay-Z adorned Beyoncé  with a platinum, diamond-encrusted cell phone one year, while Courteney Cox treated husband David Arquette to something all rich and famous people need: a full-size carousel horse.
This weekend, throngs of girls will inevitably drag an unwilling contingent from The Row to watch Kutcher’s movie Valentine’s Day, posing the question: Can budding relationships of young love actually be serious, or are they merely obligations, constructed and shaped by our existing views in popular culture?
Daily Trojan | Rita Yeung
Aside from the shaky, on-and-off again hookups resulting from poor control of teenage hormones, serious college relationships — and the ability to maintain them — are unquestionably difficult, though certainly not impossible. Valentine’s Day, however, offers a self-inflicted social critique for those who can’t seem to get it right.
After all, society and the money-making hype surrounding cupid’s big day tells us that being alone on Valentine’s Day is just the first step in a lifetime of romantic woes that eventually lead us to becoming the neighborhood cat lady or the creepy old man who spends his free time lurking at Hollywood nightclubs.
At the start of the new year, college students set out to pursue a string of lofty resolutions: go to the gym more, actually keep up with assigned reading and party less. But for many, the search for young love ranks among the top.
After a month of following through, Valentine’s Day offers a grade report of one’s progress — or lack thereof. Within the stressful social setting present on college campuses today, the day of reckoning reaffirms the pressure for young people to be connected, seriously or not. The scenario has become a bit of a college cliché: two sweethearts forcefully clinging to one another, not out of mutual feeling but for the sake of conforming to a standard.
The circle of pointlessness is further amplified when immature pairings come to a disastrous end — a frequent occurrence in modern-day Hollywood. Whether we give in to the celebrations this weekend, perhaps the college scene is still a little too light-hearted and carefree for the indefinite battlefield that more serious love most often proves to be.
In the trailer for his new movie, Kutcher says, “Valentine’s Day comes once a year, whether you like it or not.” With our society so engulfed in romanticism (and heavy chocolate consumption), I guess we’ll just have to get used to it.

After months of commotion, it looks like the swine flu epidemic is finally coming to a close. No more mass school shutdowns, no more hurried vaccinations and no more door handle-related trepidation. If the number of cases keeps dropping, the disease might join severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza on the list of forgotten pandemics. Most people will likely put away the vats of hand sanitizer and go about their pre-flu lives.
Alissa Masutani | Daily Trojan
And yet, dearest H1N1, some of us will miss you.
All things considered, you were a fairly insignificant flu. Back in October, a journalist created a graphic showing which diseases killed the greatest percentage of the people they infected. With bird flu at 60 percent, tuberculosis at 45.5 percent and bubonic plague (that old dinosaur) at 5 percent, your measly 0.5 percent doesn’t seem to merit the ruckus — especially when one considers that in the United States alone 0.1 percent of seasonal flu cases end in fatality.
The Los Angeles Times even made a chart comparing you with the seasonal flu. It turns out you two have a lot of things in common: You’re spread the same way, and you’re avoided the same way. Actually, intestinal problems are your only unique symptom. In other words, anyone who took the usual flu season precautions had little reason to worry.
Predictably, we college students were especially good at not caring about you. A November 2009 poll estimated that almost seven out of 10 Americans between 18 and 29 years old planned to ignore the shots. Nonetheless, there were only 2.6 cases out of every 10,000 college students.
But make no mistake: Though you were not the deadliest disease on the block, the craze you spawned was one of a kind.
How many jokes did your name give birth to? Suddenly, Americans weren’t just sick. We had the swines. We needed oinkment. Israel joined the fun when an official there suggested calling you Mexico flu — because pigs aren’t kosher.
Certainly, pundits will mourn your absence. The brouhaha you started in the media was something else. Anti-immigration activists loudly blamed our neighbor to the south for your existence.
Radio host Neal Boortz implied that Islamic terrorists planted you in Mexico. Twitter turned out to be the perfect place to spread ill-founded panic, as countless users offered bogus cures and warned people to stay away from pork, adding medical professionals to the list of people who want micro-blogging to die. Cosmopolitan chimed in, listing the best sex positions for avoiding you. What are the news channels going to talk about without you, dearest flu?
You even spurred a marketing trend. Perhaps no one will miss you more than a few crafty companies who realized that — recession or no recession — panicked people are going to spend. Americans bought more hand sanitizer, but that’s only the tip of the iceberg. Virtual distribution site Heyzap made an online game. Quake Kare slapped the name Swine Flu Kit on its standard flu kit, and sales shot up. T-shirt companies hopped on the bandwagon: “My dad went to Mexico, and all he got me was swine flu,” read a tee from Flushirts. Yes, there is a line of clothing called Flushirts. All for you, swine flu.
Don’t take this the wrong way. Like any disease, you were kind of a big deal. It was — and still is — a good idea to take your prevention seriously. But at the same time, taking you seriously should not have meant going nuts. Hand washing? Probably a good idea. Broadcasting rumors on the Internet? Probably not. Buying apparel to commemorate a disease? Well, that’s a personal choice.
The key is to stop the spread of panic and make sure the hard facts are visible above all else. Let’s hope that the next time a pandemic strikes, America will face the consequences with a little more common sense.

Good article, but maybe a little glib.
Swine flu may not have been a huge risk to healthy people, but for people who have ongoing or chronic illness it was very dangerous. Really! H1N1’s risk to the healthy was overstated; its risk to the sick was vastly understated.
H1N1 killed my cousin’s friend last October: she’d already had pneumonia. The swine flu, which drastically weakens your immune system, made it impossible for her to recover.
I work it in school and couldn’t avoid catching it. Swine flu caused my bronchitis to come raging back. I thought my respiratory issues were in the past. Now I have to endure sinus irrigation twice a week, maybe forever.
So, yeah, if you’re a healthy college kid or a teenager whose body is still growing and repairing constantly, yeah, what you worry? For those of us who are late twenties and older, it was a little more serious. I think the panic — and the resulting awareness/mass hand sanitizing — probably saved a lot of lives.
This is hilarious and well-written. Loved reading the article!

Los Angeles County has implemented an emergency alert system and is encouraging all local business and residents to enroll.
The County’s Emergency Operations Center uses the system, called Alert LA County, to alert residences and businesses of information concerning emergencies and necessary actions to be taken in the event one occurs, such as evacuations.
Using the 911 database, Alert LA County is able to reach all landlines in the county. These lines have already been registered into the system’s database, and no action is needed from those wishing to register their landlines.
In case of emergency, the system, which is TTY/TDD compatible, would call each line with an automated message. If the call is not answered, and the system is asked to leave a voice message, it will do so. If a line is busy or otherwise unreachable, the system will keep redialing the number.
Officials are urging residents to register their cell phone numbers, voice over IP (VOIP) numbers, and email addresses with the system. In case of emergency, Alert LA County will contact registrants with phone messages, text messages and email as an insurance against a potentially unreachable landline.
Joe Segura  of the Long Beach Press-Telegram reported that due to heavy rain between January 18-22, officials activated the system 34 times.  Alerts reached as many as 513 people, and as few as 34.
Los Angeles County states that all information provided will not be shared, and will be used solely for emergency contact. Registration for Alert LA County is located at http://alert.lacounty.gov/

For the second time this month, a sprinkler was set off by a student in a freshmen residence hall, displacing dozens of students and causing damage to both the building and students’ personal items.
The most recent event took place in Parkside Arts and Humanities on Friday night at 8 p.m. when a freshman hung a coat from the sprinkler head, which was then set off when her roommate hit it with the door.
The mishap caused water damage and flooded four suites, displacing 32 students.
Those students, however, were not given alternative housing until Saturday, when arrangements were made for the students to relocate to the Radisson Hotel. These costs were covered by the university.
The length of their stay there is currently unknown.
“They said four to five days but they’re not sure,” said Stephanie Choi, a freshman majoring in neuroscience who was displaced by the flood.
Choi said the majority of damage to personal items took place in her room. Both hers and her roommates laptops and printers were ruined, along with books, bedding, shoes, food and anything else on the floor at the time.
Currently, they are unsure exactly what damages the school will cover.
“I know I’m going to get reimbursed for my laptop and printer,” said Choi.
She does not, however, believe the school will be paying for the rest of her damaged personal items.

Actor and comedian Aziz Ansari will be performing stand-up tonight at USC’s Bovard Auditorium. Students anticipate a packed show as the 26-year-old star stops by campus to promote his new CD and DVD, Intimate Moments for a Sensual Evening, which is a recorded performance of the comedian’s first Comedy Central standup special.
The young actor got his start in the world of comedy performing stand-up around New York City while attending New York University. In 2005, Ansari teamed up with fellow comedians Rob Huebel and Paul Scheer, along with director Jason Woliner, to write short films. The group made the sketch comedy show Human Giant, which aired on MTV in 2007.
Ansari currently stars on NBC’s Parks and Recreation, playing a mischievous and swaggering government official who hawkishly flirts with women. With the show in its second season, Ansari has received a considerable amount of praise from critics for his sarcastic brand of humor.
Recently it was announced that Judd Apatow and Universal Pictures have picked up three movie pitches from Aziz Ansari and Jason Woliner. In an interview, Ansari expressed his astonishment, as he did not expect Apatow and Universal Pictures to be interested in realizing all three films. This Apatow and Ansari deal, however, is not the first time the two have worked together. Ansari played an energetic standup comedian named Randy in Apatow’s 2009 comedy/drama film Funny People. The fictional character, Randy, had received such a positive response following Funny People that Ansari plans on centering one of the three movies with Universal on the character. Dates as to when the films will be completed have not yet been announced, but Ansari’s unique brand of dry comedy will be on full display in Bovard tonight.

After signing one of the nation’s top recruiting classes, it appears coach Lane Kiffin is already working on securing another highly touted prospect, David Sills.
Sills, however isn’t a high school state champion or Gatorade Player of the Year, he is a gangly, 5-foot-11 13-year-old hailing from Bear, Del.
That’s right. For the prognosticators and analysts like ESPN’s Tom Lugenbill, whose day-to-day professional obligations hinge on signing day, start preparing for the Class of 2015, because the Trojans’ have already found what they believe is their first five-star recruit.
This recruit, it seems, is unlike any to come before him — his rare ability may overshadow the fact he is still in middle school. Just ask his trainer Steve Clarkson.
Clarkson, who is known around the football community for his bold statements and well-recognized quarterback clients, believe at his age, Sills is the best he is ever worked with.
For a coach whose tutored mentees like Matt Leinart, Jimmy Clausen and Matt Barkley, that statement caught the eye of Kiffin and USC.
“His skill set is off the chart; I’ve never seen anyone at his age do what he’s been able to do,” Clarkson told ESPN.com.
One look at his YouTube highlights and call from Clarkson later, and the USC head coach was convinced Sills, even at age 13, was the real deal.
On Thursday night the scholarship offer became official, as Sills, who has yet to meet with the Trojans’ staff, verbally agreed to attend USC in 2015. While the young man has yet to experience the bright lights of a Friday night or his senior prom, choosing the cardinal and gold was the only logical choice.
While the Delaware-native considers USC a dream school, his unprecedented verbal agreement is not set in stone until he officially signs his letter of intent in Feb. 2015.
Although the decision has set off a rash criticism in the direction of Kiffin and his staff, the unorthodox decision is just another move in a long line that proves the USC coach never takes a day off.
For Kiffin’s sake, let’s hope by the time Sills is eligible to put on a USC jersey in five years, the coach is still around to witness it. Only time will tell.

If there has been a constant for the No. 1 USC men’s tennis team  — other than non-conference home victories — it has been rain whenever No. 60 University of San Diego  was on the schedule.
On Sunday — after two previously scheduled matches were rained out — the Trojans (6-0, 0-0) defeated the Toreros (2-0, 0-0) 7-0 at Marks Tennis Stadium.
This match marked the first time that USC played against Toreros coach Brett Masi — who was an assistant on USC’s staff for the previous four seasons.
The Trojans were excited to show off their talents against coach Masi.
“It was fun to play against [Masi] for the first time.  We had a little bit of extra motivation, but it wasn’t a distraction,” senior Robert Farah said.
The fact that the Trojans were not distracted was evident. They won every single match to complete another sweep of a non-conference opponent.
In doubles, the combinations of Farah and No. 65 freshman JT Sundling — at No. 1 — and sophomores Steve Johnson and Daniel Nguyen continued to dominate their foes, winning 8-1 and 8-2, respectively.
Juniors Peter Lucassen and Jaak Poldma continued their solid play winning 8-6 over sophomore Nikola Bubnic and junior Abdullah Hashem.
During the singles portion, USC only dropped one set throughout the six matches.
At the first position, No. 14 Farah displayed an overpowering first serve and an exceptional return of serve, dominating junior Dean Jackson — before he retired from the match in the second set.
Sundling was the only singles player to lose a set but returned to form in the final two sets in his triumph over Hashem 3-6, 6-1, 6-3.
The rest of lineup overwhelmed the Toreros, with No. 1 Johnson winning over Bubnic 6-2, 6-3; No. 78 Daniel Nguyen defeating senior Charl Wolmarans 6-3, 6-1; Peter Lucassen finishing off a 7-5, 6-2 victory over freshman Thibaut Visy; and No. 47 sophomore Matt Kecki playing consistently in his defeat of junior Nils Schive 6-2, 6-2.
At the conclusion of this six match home stand to start the season, USC coach Peter Smith has been satisfied with his players getting important match experience and displaying the depth of his team.
“This stretch has been a great experience, especially for our newer guys,” Smith said. “We have a ton of possibilities four our team, we have eight guys to choose from for our doubles lineup.”
The Trojans have displayed their lineup depth, but that depth will surely be tested at the upcoming upcoming ITA National Team Indoor Championships — starting Friday, Feb. 12.
With this positive stretch to begin the season behind them, the team seems ready as the intensity of the season will ratchet up at the Indoor Championships against the best teams in the nation.

This time around, they’re going to finish. Eight months after the then-No. 3 women’s golf team lost the lead on the last day of the NCAA Championships, the Women of Troy prepare to make a similar run with a different ending.
With as much talent as any team in the nation, the No. 9 team has its sights set on their third national championship in eight years. The Women of Troy look to their four returning All-Americans — sophomore Jennifer Song, junior Lizette Salas, senior Belen Mozo and senior Stefanie Endstrasser — to lead them back to the top.
The team was strong out of the gate in the fall, winning the Mason Rudolph Championship to begin the season. Song captured the individual title at the Mason Rudolph and the subsequent Stanford Invitational title. The then-No. 1 Women of Troy looked ready to run through the fall invitational season, until Song took time off to play on the LPGA tour. At the NCAA Fall Preview, the first tournament without Song, the team finished 16th of 18, its worst finish in five years. After Mozo withdrew with an injury, the team fell from first place on the first day to 16th on the third day, culminating in Mozo withdrawing in the final round with an injury. The team bounced back to finish third at the Turtle Bay Collegiate Invitational the next week, but its streak of 32 straight top ten finishes was already broken.
This semester, the team looks to avoid such a drop off. With the roster healthier than it has been all fall and the renewed presence of Song, the team looks to pick up where it left off at the Mason Rudolph on its way to the Championship.
Song, the No. 1 golfer in the country, is returning for her final semester. She participated in just two tournaments in the fall and came away with two titles. She competed on the LPGA tour during the remainder of the fall 2009 season and will be doing so again this spring. Song was invited to play in the Kraft Nabisco Championship in April, one of the four major tournaments on the tour.
Salas, coming off an individual victory at Turtle Bay, looks to become a three-time All-American this season. She spent the fall recovering from a back injury sustained over the summer but was in prime form by the end of the season. She hopes to maintain the momentum she gained at the end of the fall throughout the spring. Last year, Salas finished tied for 18th at the Championship and looks to improve on that finish this season.
Mozo, looking to become the first four-time All-American in program history, spent the fall season battling a shoulder injury lingering from the end of her junior season. After surgery over the summer, she had to withdraw from the NCAA Fall Preview because of the pain. After resting the injury over the break, she appears healthy for the spring.
Endstrasser continued to struggle with consistency throughout the fall, appearing in only two tournaments, in which she finished tied for 21st and 79th. She’ll be competing with senior Caroline Kim, sophomore Inah Park and freshman Cyna Rodriguez for playing time throughout the spring. Kim and Park were the Women of Troy’s only members to play in every tournament round in the fall season. Rodriguez enters the spring coming off a victory at the Philippine Ladies Open Amateur Golf Championship in January.
The team begins its spring season this week at the Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge at the Palos Verdes Golf Club, in Palos Verdes, Calif. The Challenge will be a good preview of the competition for the rest of the season; it features six of the top 10 teams in the country, highlighted by Pac-10 rivals No. 1 Arizona State, No. 2 UCLA and No. 10 Cal. The important thing to this team is not the start but the finish. A repeat of last year’s National Championship is not what it’s looking for. Come June, this team wants to finish.

The No. 13 USC men’s swimming and diving team fell to No. 4 California (158-136) and No. 2 Stanford (174-125) over the weekend.
The Trojans showcased many nail-biting finishes and close calls, but it wasn’t enough to overthrow the Bay Area Pac-10 giants.
However, the men have made up immense ground since the last time these teams met, and for the first time in a long time made the Golden Bears and the Cardinals work for their victory.
“I think the guys are starting to recognize that they can compete against a team like Stanford and Cal,” USC coach Dave Salo said. “The psychological realization is huge.”
The men fell harder to Cal on Friday, despite the overall score showing a smaller defeat. Junior Richard Charlesworth won the 1000-yard freestyle in a 9:22.46, and came second behind USC senior Zoltan Povazsay, who clocked a 4:26.96 and scored himself an NCAA consideration ‘B’ cut.
The competition marked the final dual meet for Povazsay, as well as graduating seniors Evan Marcus and captain James Martin who won the 400-yard individual medley with a 3:57.79.
USC’s top breaststroker Dillon Connolly won the 200-yard (1:59.92) and came second in the 100-yard breaststroke (55.22), behind Cal’s Damir Dugonjic who clocked a new pool record of 54.20.
The races were closer on Saturday against Stanford and often came down to the touch.
USC’s 200-yard medley relay caused an upset by beating Stanford in the first event of the day in a time of 1:29.38.
“The medley relay was a big boost,” Salo said. “USC hasn’t beat Stanford in that relay for four or five years.”
The team included freshmen Alex Lendrum, junior Clement Lefert, Connolly and sophomore Jeff Daniels.
The 200-yard freestyle was arguably the most exciting race of the day for the Trojans. The field was neck and neck the entire way, with USC sophomore captain Pat White holding a strong lead until the last 50 yards, when Povazsay, Lefert and Stanford’s Rob Andrews all made their move.
It was anybody’s race as four of the fastest 200-yard freestylers in the country battled it out until the final yards, where Povazsay out-stretched the rest at the finish and claimed first place in a time of 1:36.44. There was barely an inch between the other three, who hammered into the wall with less than a second between them. Lefert was second in 1:37.07, Stanford’s Andrews third in 1:37.31 and White took fourth place in a 1:37.70.
Lefert went on to win the 100-yard butterfly in a 48.59.
The Trojans diving team competed last weekend during the women’s Stanford and Cal dual meet, where sophomore Harrison Jones dominated the competition by winning both the 1-meter and the 3-meter against both schools.

He was gone in an instant. And then, almost as quickly, he was back.
Four days after Stan Holt, a team manager for the USC men’s basketball team, was fired, head coach Kevin O’Neill decided to recant his decision and give Holt a second chance.
The strangest aspect of this story may not be O’ Neill’s rash decision-making regarding Holt’s position with the team. Instead, the most noteworthy detail may deal with the reason why Holt lost his job in the first place.
The graduate student was removed from the bench Jan. 30 after a team loss at Oregon. He received a technical foul with four minutes and 35 seconds left in the game. At the time, the Trojans were down 49-47. Oregon made both free throws following the call and went on a 15-2 run, denying the Trojans any chance of coming away with a victory.
USC lost the game 67-57. It was the team’s fifth loss in seven games.
O’Neill said it was the first time he had ever heard of a manager getting a technical.
He announced his decision to fire Holt immediately following the Oregon game.
Holt was reportedly yelling obscenities at the referee. He apologized for his actions but claimed he did not use any profanity. O’Neill said he had not had problems with Holt in the past.
Besides serving as a manager for the basketball team, Holt has also worked with the Trojan football team.

Although it was announced last November, The Who’s performance during the Super Bowl halftime show was still a shock.
Not only was the 360 degree light-up stage and laser show one of the grandest in Super Bowl history but the remaining members of one of rock’s greatest acts managed to pull off playing songs that under other circumstances might seem more sad than epic.
With one country-themed exception, 1990s Super Bowl halftime shows were either Disney-sponsored pop acts (1991’s New Kids on the Block and 1995’s Miami Sound Machine) or soulful singers of yore (1998’s The Temptations and 1999’s Chaka Khan).
In the last decade, however, the halftime show producers have acknowledged the football event’s mostly-older, white audience and opted for more classic rock acts such as U2, The Rolling Stones and Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers.
The Who fit this post-millennial bill, but instead of Mick Jagger prancing around on a tongue-shaped stage or Bruce Springsteen hyping us into “putting the chicken fingers down,” Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend played it cool and let their impressive medley trigger the surrounding visual display.
To the chagrin of epileptic football fans, The Who’s set was accompanied by green and blue lasers that shot from the rafters like a Jennifer Lopez “Waiting For Tonight” music video and the circular stage pulsated with white, red and blue neon like a Who-themed Simon.
So what if it’s weird to watch old guys belt out youth-tinged tunes like “Teenage Wasteland” and “Pinball Wizard.” Where previous halftime performances relied on flamboyant visual displays and full-frontal “wardrobe malfunctions” for entertainment, the Tommy-ending set and palpable-after-all-these-years chemistry between Daltrey and Townshend helped make this year’s halftime show a scandal-free comeback worth actually listening to.

Before we can truly praise Lane Kiffin and his staff for their work in securing what ESPN’s Tom Luginbill ranked as the No. 7 best recruiting class in the country, it appears that air of optimism making its way through Heritage Hall may have taken a bit of a hit today from the biggest man to hit Southern California since Shaquille O’Neal.
Wednesdasy, Seantrel Henderson, the 6’8” 300 pound man-child, also considered by most publications as the best offensive tackle in this year’s recruiting class, surprised many when he ended his live song and dance performance, now known as a college announcement ceremony, by donning the Cardinal and Gold. And while the football program and fans alike should be excited over the St. Paul native’s decision to come to Los Angeles — they should first make sure Henderson actually makes his way onto campus.
Despite what hours earlier seemed like the picturesque first step for Kiffin and company in their quest to get back to the proverbial promised land, Sean Henderson, Seantrel’s father, crashed the celebratory party with a disclaimer.
According to a report by the New York Times, Henderson’s father said his family will wait to sign his letter of intent until after USC stands before the NCAA infractions committee on Feb. 19. While any decision on whether the university will suffer possible sanctions for violations incurred during Pete Carroll’s tenure likely will come to fruition at a later date, the Henderson family believes the hearing will give them more clarity as to whether USC and the top offensive lineman in the country are a match made in heaven.
This cruel blow to the psyche of anxious USC fans took another turn Thursday morning. Bree Jasper, Seantrel’s mother refuted the New York Times report by telling StarTribune.com that her son is “definitely going to USC.” Whether this is just another ploy by a headline-driven family or a declarative statement, no one knows.
The only thing etched in stone at this point is that recruits have until April 1 to sign their letter of intent with a program, but for Trojan fans, count your lucky stars the big guy makes his decision before April Fool’s Day.
