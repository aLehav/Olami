The Inventor, The Escort, The Photographer, Her Boyfriend and His Girlfriend, written and directed by Matt Morillo, somehow manages to pack small spaces, naked women, sex toys, and a hooker into a small, one-act play.
Taking place in two different New York apartments during a blizzard, the place could best be called eccentric.

Organized into two acts, the first finds a sensitive man named Jeffrey (Jaret Sacry)anxiously awaiting a guest.
As “Fly Me to the Moon” plays, the audience gazes upon the apartment, filled with a miniature tiki bar with two inflatable palm trees and a pair of beach chairs to match. Jeffrey enters stage right in shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, obsessively rearranging the items at the bar. His anxiously awaited guest finally arrives: Julia (Jessica Moreno), an escort hired for the night.
Jeffrey proves to be an endearing, thoughtful man who is plagued by low self-esteem. Convinced he’s a freak that no woman would want, he relies on the escort service for companionship and sex. Julia is a sassy cynic who has had an equally lonely life. The two have clever dialogue that showcases both their idiosyncrasies as well as Morillo’s writing prowess.
Though their date begins as strictly business, it soon becomes a night between friends as the two share past intimate experiences and their real names. Instead of focusing on raunchy activities, the two share tender moments and the romance thickens.
The cast of Act I are perfect for their roles. Sacry portrays Jeffrey as a seemingly closeted man with no game. He seems anxious and delivers much of the dialogue haltingly, and it forces the audience to wonder if his halting performance is due to the actor’s nerves or a part of the plot. Nevertheless, Sacry’s performance encourages the audience to root for the unlucky underdog.
Acting opposite of Sacrey, Moreno’s interpretation of a feisty escort is natural and believable. She seems to not really be acting but instead living the part. She delivers her lines with gusto and plays with speech rhythms, often infusing otherwise normal dialogue with laugh-out-loud humor.
A strong contrast to Act One, Act Two centers around the photographer, her boyfriend and his girlfriend. .
Jeffrey Cannata stars as John, a man attempting to deal with his on and off again girlfriend as well as a new love. Isidora Goreshter plays the angry girlfriend Karen while Jenni Halina performs believably as John’s tryst on the side, who also happens to be Karen’s cousin.
As the second act moves along, more and more sex comes into play. Vividly depicting tantalizing sexual acts on stage, director Matt Morillo is obviously not afraid of a little nudity.
Without humor, the play would just be considered glorified pornography, but thanks to funny zingers, the play finds a groove.
At one point, Halina’s Molly performs an “interpretive dance” dressed as a skimpy nurse. Watching ardently, John exclaims, “I totally get the health care message too. You’re not fully covered!”
Unlike the actors of Act One, the cast of Act Two are not as nuanced with their characters, though it seems as if Morillo simply did not flesh out the roles as much. Cannata is loud and assertive while still managing to show a bit of fear around angry women. Goreshter’s Karen is aggressive yet vulnerable as she faces her unfaithful boyfriend. The only two-dimensional character proved to be Molly, who Halina plays with as much emotional variety as a wall. Her role requires complete nudity, so it’s possible the casting directors gave more leeway to acting talent.
Though the first act is far superior than the second, The Inventor, The Escort, The Photographer, Her Boyfriend and His Girlfriend turns out to be a rather enjoyable ride.
It goes to show that sex is not completely void of humor, and can sometimes be the funniest activity of all.
The Inventor, The Escort, The Photographer, Her Boyfriend, and His Girlfriend is playing in The Lounge Theatre through July 8.
 
“nudity? hot. i’m in.”
why the quotes lol
haa just meant that that’s what any guy reading would say after . I finally saw the show. she was excellent not just because she was pretty and undressed. she was funny and believable! It was funny how both her and the other girl wore naughty costumes, I don’t know why this article failed to mention the other girl’s sexy cop outfit. I also liked the inventor a lot and all the weird sex toys.
How can you credit yourself as a reviewer, or a writer, critiquing actors on the details of their performance when you cannot even pay attention to the details of spelling their names correctly.  You misspelled Jaret SACREY three times while spelling it correctly once.  ??
LOL!
I am stunned at your accusation that Jenni Halina was cast in the play principally because she undressed for the casting directors. Suggesting that an actress received a part for something other than her talent is sexist and insulting and an insidious myth that actresses have had to fight for many years. You’re apparently ignorant of her work in New York theater and can’t even be bothered to spell her name correctly.

It is often said that if you want to “make it” in the music industry, you need to live in entertainment capitals, such as Los Angeles, New York City or even Nashville.
But a couple of natives from Edmonton, Ky. — which sports only a population of 1,607 people — proves that saying wrong.
This small town is known for two things: The Kentucky Headhunters, a country rock band that gained fame in the early ’90s, and Black Stone Cherry, a newer Southern rock band with soul. Both bands are in the same family business.

“My dad and uncle are in The Kentucky Headhunters, and they actually produced our first record for us. We’ve had a lot of help from our families and friends. We can never forget that, you know?” drummer John Fred Young said.
For Young, the word “family” encompassed more than just his immediate kin.
“We all went to kindergarten together,” Young said about his bandmates Chris Robertson, Ben Wells and Jon Lawhon. “We were crazy friends, and it’s amazing to play anywhere because we’re from such a small town.”
Black Stone Cherry was formed on lead singer Robertson’s birthday — June 4 — and after eleven years, the band is still going strong. The intimacy that was formed through the band members’ long friendship shines through their soulful, hard-hitting songs.
The band’s latest record, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, released May 31 last year, delivers a nice balance between heavy riff-driven songs such as “White Trash Millionaire” and “Blame It On the Boom Boom” and heartfelt ballads such as “All I’m Dreamin’ Of.”
Though Black Stone Cherry’s songwriting process hasn’t changed, the band’s production style had to change because of the record label’s pressures and changes in popular rock radio.
“The American music system runs on radio, and especially for rock bands, that’s how we get heard. Our label pressured us to make a record that appealed to American rock stations,” Young said.
Howard Benson, who has produced for Gavin DeGraw, 3 Doors Down, Relient K and countless more, was brought in to take the band in a more commercial route.
“I think after every album we learn something new. It’s a building process. No band starts off and says we know everything there is to know about music and recording. You meet people that changes your outlook on music,” Young said.
Since the release of its eponymous debut album in 2006, Black Stone Cherry has been on the road supporting big acts like Nickelback and Def Leppard as well as headlining on its own.
“We’ve been on the road for six or seven years, and our forte is playing live,” Young said. “Also, our live shows and musicianship builds on our fans. That’s just how we make fans.”
And even though Young and the rest of the band are from the U.S., they have a much bigger fanbase in Europe, especially in the U.K.
“The fans in Europe and U.K. rock because they’ve had the rock festival circuit for so many years,” Young said. “Sometimes fans in the U.S. look left and right and ask ‘Can we have a good time?’ But still, I think U.S. is catching up.”
Going off this, it would seem that the response from fans overseas would trump those from back home, but Young says that’s not true in all cases.
“Recently, I got a letter from a fan back home saying ‘I haven’t talked to my dad for probably eight years. And if I hadn’t heard your songs, I would have never talked to my dad,’’ Young said proudly. “It’s something that means more to my heart. It means more than selling eight million records or even getting a Grammy.”
For many bands, earning platinum plaques and accolades would be its main aim or indicator of success. But for Black Stone Cherry, its direct relationship with the band’s fans is what defines success.
“When we write songs, we ask ‘What’s the most real things we can say?’ Young said. “It doesn’t matter how old you are, where you’re from, or what color you are. Honest to God, everybody loves music, especially heartfelt music.”
Black Stone Cherry has been on the road with rock supergroup Chickenfoot, which has former and active band members from Van Halen and Red Hot Chili Peppers. Its last stop will be in Los Angeles, but Black Stone Cherry will continue to tour throughout 2012 in Europe.
“We’re always going to be playing, but hopefully we can take six months off and write our new record,” Young said.
Black Stone Cherry will perform at the Greek Theatre on Sunday.
i love bsc i hope they come to west virginia so i can see them live im there biggest fan and i dont live that far away from there home town they have the best music sound lyrics of all time there real country boys and it shows through everything they do love you guys keep up the great music with alot of soul
I hope they never have to entirely change their sound because of pressure from radio. Of course, I want them to have success, but don’t change for it. What you have now is what made people fall in love with the band in the first place.

Stories are made to be retold.
But only a few of the most successful, lasting narratives have the staying power to become engrained into the fabric of our culture. Snow White and the Huntsmanis the latest adaptation — two months after Mirror, Mirror — of one such story. Everyone is familiar with the evil queen, the magic mirror, the dwarves, the apple and true love’s kiss. With a tale this timeless, it’s all in the execution.
But free of any surprises, Huntsman is exactly what one would expect from a big-budget take on the Snow White fable.
Its tone is exactly as dark as it needs to be to achieve commercial viability with 18- to 39-year-old males, and as a result the film is not the subversively exciting revision of a classic story it might think itself. Rather, it’s a completely safe tread through been-there, done-that acts of PG-13 fantasy.
Though the film flaunts impressive celebrities, they only do the bare minimum required of them to make the movie work.
Kristen Stewart is kind and good-intentioned enough to justify her status as the chosen hero, and admittedly, it’s nice to see her play something approximating a strong female character. Opposite her is Chris Hemsworth’s Huntsman, a suitable tough guy whose better nature simmers under scars the cruel world inflicted upon him.
Charlize Theron, the focal point of the film’s marketing campaign, possesses the unnaturally haunting beauty required to sell us on the evil Queen Ravenna, though the sorceress clearly didn’t get the message that immediately flying into a rage upon receiving bad news is neither the most effective nor the most menacing strategy by which to rule.
Then there are the seven dwarves, which come across as perfunctory to the rest of the film. It’s almost as if the filmmakers said: “We had to have the seven dwarves in this thing, so here they are.” And in lieu of memorable personalities — one’s even called Gus, which says something — they’re portrayed by a digitally shortened line-up of recognizable and well-liked Brits including Ian McShane and Ray Winstone.
Huntsman’s cast is its most squandered resource, but it fares far better with regard to visual design. The highlights are the two forest settings: One, a psychologically torturous maze of nightmarish visions, the other, a lush sanctuary populated by flora and fauna that would find themselves at home in the far superior fairytale film Princess Mononoke.
Other sights worth seeing? The queen’s magic, when realized correctly, is dazzling — particularly when birds are involved. The mirror, however, is a fantastic disappointment. A plain gold disc when not in use morphs when questioned into a liquid metal creature that, though brought to life with lackluster CGI, manages to look far stupider than the T-1000 in James Cameron’s Terminator sequel.
Thematically, Huntsman is at its best when it briefly and rather subtly addresses what “true love” might really mean. The film’s romantic elements are, if not particularly convincing, at least well-intentioned.
The one trope from earlier versions of the story that this adaptation tries to avert altogether is the antiquated notion of the handsome prince falling for the helpless princess because she’s there. Actual love is deeper than that, and at the end of the day this take on Snow White understands human emotion far better than Kristen Stewart’s other fantasy blockbusters.
Yet that goodwill doesn’t count for much during the action climax, a medieval siege battle exactly like the kind you’d find in a thousand other films. Men rush at gates, arrows fly, swords slash and armored soldiers die of bloodless wounds. There’s even a Wilhelm scream for good measure. Nothing exists to distinguish the battle save a bit of the queen’s magic at the end, and really, it’s nothing too impressive.
All in all, Snow White and the Huntsman just goes through the motions. And that’s the sad thing: Here was an opportunity to tell a classic story in a new way, but instead we have a story everyone knows told exactly like any other Hollywood fantasy film.
A lot of great works are noticeably predictable or derivative. To be both in the extreme is boring, and though nothing about it is truly bad, in the end Snow White and the Huntsman fails to stand out because it lacks the same purity of heart so highly valued in its protagonist.

The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety crime/incident summary between Thursday, May 31, and Tuesday, June 5.
Crimes against a person
At 8:33 p.m. on June 1, DPS officers responded to a report of a combative patient at the Keck Hospital and upon their arrival two nurses said he struck them and another patient several times without provocation.  The officers stood by while the nurses administered medication to the patient, then they cleared the scene without further incident.
at 7:45 p.m. on May 31, a student was arrested and booked by LAPD officers after punching an undercover officer in the face during an encounter at Subway.
at 3:37 p.m. on May 31, a suspect pulled off a screen and climbed through an unsecured window to gain entry at 2340 Portland St.  The suspect removed five containers of collectible coins and fled on foot when a resident returned home and confronted him. DPS officers responded and conducted a search, but were unable to locate the suspect.
At 2:56 p.m. on May 31, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect with a possible gun threatening a non-USC female at the Earyl Childhood Training Center and detained him for investigation.  No gun was found and a witness said she believed the suspect was simulating a weapon.  During questioning, the suspect made statements about wanting to harm himself and others, so the officers transported him to the Southwest station to be evaluated by a mental assessment team.  LAPD officers then transported the suspect to LAC+USC Hospital for psychiatric care.
Crimes against property
At 1:20 p.m. on June 4, a suspect smashed the rear passenger side window of a car at 929 21st St. to gain entry and removed a GPS unit, a cell phone device, a passport and two vehicle keys.
At 12:49 p.m. on June 3, DPS officers responded to a report of three juveniles carrying two locked bicycles near the Carol Little Building and detained them for investigation.  The officers were unable to locate the owners of the bikes to determine if a crime had been committed, so the juveniles were released to their guardians and the bikes were impounded at the DPS office.
At 7:41 p.m. on June 1, a suspect pulled off a screen and opened an unsecured window to gain entry at 2108 Portland St.  The suspect removed a microwave oven and a toaster.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 3:40 a.m. on June 4, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect prowling near the University Park Health Center and detained him for investigation. The officers found no evidence of a crime having been committed, but they determined that the suspect had no legitimate business on campus.  The suspect was then advised against trespassing on university property and released.
At 12:49 a.m. on June 4, DPS officers cited a non-USC male for jaywalking at Jefferson at Figueroa.
At 11:06 p.m. on June 3, DPS officers responded to a report of two suspects loitering at 23rd Street and Portland Street. When they detained them for investigation, they found one of the subjects to be intoxicated and unable to care for himself.  The suspect was arrested and  transported to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.  The second suspect was questioned and released.
At 8:24 p.m. on June 3, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a suspect panhandling outside Spudnuts and detained him for investigation. The officers found the suspect to be intoxicated and unable to care for himself. He was arrested and transported to the Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.
At 7:32 p.m. on June 3, DPS officers responded to a report of a lost and disoriented non-USC female at the Hoover Child Development Center. When they contacted her she said that she lives in a safe house in the area.  The officers were able help her locate the house and they dropped her off after a caretaker confirmed that she lived there.
At 4:41 p.m. on June 3, DPS officers responded to a report of a non-USC female refusing to leave the Radisson Hotel after failing to pay her hotel bill.  The officers advised  her that she must leave the premises and she complied without further incident.
At 6:19 p.m. on June 2, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a non-USC male who appeared to be under the influence of a controlled substance staggering along the sidewalk near Starbucks and detained him for investigation. The officers found him in possession of drug paraphernalia that contained heroine residue. He was arrested and transported to the Southwest station for booking.
At 11:08 a.m. on June 2, DPS officers responded to a student who reported that a child was alone outside 1205 30th St. after being dropped off to visit a relative who was not home. LAPD officers responded to take custody of the child and she was subsequently released to family members.
At 12:48 a.m. on June 2, DPS officers responded to an intoxicated non-USC male who passed out in front of the Delta Chi fraternity house.  The male was unresponsive when contacted by the officers, so an LAFD RA unit was requested.  RA Unit #15 responded and examined the male. He was transported to California Hospital for medical treatment.
At 8:09 p.m. on June 1, DPS officers responded to a fire alarm that was accidentally activated by a child who was playing with a pull station in Bovard Auditorium.  No smoke or fire was found. FMS personnel responded to reset the alarm and cleared the building for reentry.
At 1:12 p.m. on June 1, DPS officers detained a non-USC male who was observed drinking an alcoholic beverage at a bus stop near Adams Boulevard and Normandie Street. He was subsequently arrested, cited and released by LAPD officers who responded to the scene.

Over the last half century the average cost of college has increased six fold, according to the National Center for Education Services, but the number of hours students spend per week studying has decreased.
College students spend approximately 15 hours per week reading, writing and preparing for class, according to the National Survey of Student Engagement, which is administered to freshman and seniors at four-year colleges and universities. In 1962, college students spent an average of 24 hours per week studying.
Productivity · Amy Ehrhart, left, and Jari Haile, right, study in Leavey Library with their computers. Some students said technology has decreased the amount of time they are able to devote to studying. - Arkadiy Garber | Summer Trojan
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Programs Gene Bickers, who has taught at USC for 24 years, said USC does not follow the trend of decreased time studying.
“I have not seen a decline in studying,” Bickers said. “If anything, at USC there are stable study patterns or possibly an increase.”
USC’s rise as a research university and its selectiveness have attributed to an increase in the number of hours USC students spend studying per week, Bickers said.
“If you look at the academic qualification of the students, it has never been better,” Bickers said. “The students I come across are more talented and better prepared than 24 years ago.”
Brian Rodriguez, a research assistant and doctoral student at the Rossier School of Education, said the rising cost of college tuition has forced students to work instead of study. About two-thirds of college students work part- or full-time to help finance their education, according to an Associate Press/Viacom poll.
“The increase in cost of education coupled with stagnant financial aid makes having a job in college necessary for college completion,” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez said students should ideally spend no more than 10 to 15 hours per week working or taking part in extracurricular activities.
“[Though] maintaining employment helps students with employment skills, it can compromise a student’s education,” Rodriguez said. “Students working excessive hours are more likely to miss classes compared to students who are working less than 20 hours per week.”
Jason Perkins, a research assistant and doctoral student at Rossier, said though technology can cut the amount of time needed for research, it is not a substitute for studying.
“With technology, the research time that is required is drastically reduced,” Perkins said. “But it can also be a distraction.”
Claire Robertson-MacLeod, a junior majoring in communication, said the constant presence of technology decreases her productivity.
“Even if I don’t bring my laptop so I don’t get distracted, I still bring my phone,” Robertson-MacLeod said. “There is always some way to connect to the Internet.”
The NSSE study found that the number of hours students study per week is dependent on their major. Architecture and physics students studied an average of 24 and 20 hours per week, respectively, and psychology and communication majors studied on average 14 and 13 hours per week, respectively.
Anne Cochran, a junior majoring in global health, said she studies about 10 to 20 hours per week.
“I feel like you definitely have to study more [if you are pre-med], because it’s competitive and the classes are more difficult,” Cochran said.
Bickers said students should study two hours for every one hour of class.
“I know there are students that can get by without devoting as much time to studying as others do,” Bickers said. “But it often means you are getting a superficial experience.”
An average USC student taking 16 units should, therefore, study about 32 hours per week.
Rodriguez said students are often unaware of how much they should study for a particular class.
“Professors should be more explicit about how many hours [students] should study,” Rodriguez said. “Students often don’t know how long they should be studying.”

Kristina Raspe, vice president for real estate development and asset management, spent her childhood traveling around the country from Air Force base to Air Force base, depending on her father’s assignments. And she loved it.
“I know so many kids that grow up in the Air Force or military don’t enjoy relocating a lot,” she said. “But I really enjoyed it. I loved meeting new people.”
Real estate · After a childhood spent moving between different Air Force bases, Raspe discovered interests in law and real estate. - Photo courtesy of Kristina Raspe
Her family settled down at Edwards Air Force Base around the time she finished elementary school and she has spent most of her life since in Southern California. She said she chose to attend UC Santa Barbara for her undergraduate degree because she had never lived near a beach. She also looked to her parents for inspiration in choosing a major.
“Both my parents had always been very civically engaged and I thought one day I would want to run for public office,” she said. “I studied political science and had to take a few classes that focused on legal issues and the law.”
Raspe finished her undergraduate degree in two years, knowing she would either get her Ph.D. in political science or go to law school after graduating. She said she decided to go to law school because she “found it more fun.”
She attended Loyola Law School and soon became interested in the legal side of real estate, working with firms that specialize in real estate and land-use law, such as TroyGould. She began working with USC as outside counsel on real estate issues before becoming the associate senior vice president for real estate and asset management at USC in 2006.
“I loved working with the university because the mission of the university is appealing to me. [It’s] made the work more meaningful,” she said. “When you’re building a building so people can try and cure cancer, that’s a lot more inspirational than building a building for people to make cell phones work better or to make a movie.”
Raspe was appointed vice president for real estate development and asset management in July 2011. Her duties include overseeing the Master Plan, the university’s future plans for expansion and renovation through 2030, including new academic facilities and The Village at USC.
“I love working in urban environments,” she said. “When you can have a positive impact on the built environment, you can have a positive impact on the people. I like working on projects that impact people and I think, for example, the Village will have a positive impact on the neighborhood.”
In addition to the Master Plan, Raspe oversees many of USC’s real estate transactions.
“The responsibilities of this department are so broad,” she said. “I could be negotiating a lease meeting with city officials, walking a construction site, doing a presentation for students or industry partners. I never know from day to day. It’s so fun and diverse.”
She also found time to return to school for two master’s degrees in construction management and real estate development, both from USC. She said, because of tuition assistance offered to employees, she decided to return to school to refine her skills and knowledge.
“[In] some of the classes, I think I drove the professor crazy,” she said. “Having been a land use attorney for several years, I think the professor got tired of my constantly interjecting my thoughts on her course.”
Raspe said she doesn’t know how long she plans to stay with USC but looks forward to seeing the progress of the Master Plan and university’s recent acquisition of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the estimated $70 million of needed renovations.
“The Coliseum is a national landmark and a treasure for all of Los Angeles,” she said. “The idea that I can play a role in revitalizing that treasure is really inspirational.”
She is also excited to see USC break ground on the Master Plan.
“I don’t think I’ve ever had a project with this time horizon,” she said. “I like longer projects because they involve more strategy. I intend to see the first phase of the project through.”

Construction crews employed by the university accidentally triggered two gas leaks during May, raising questions about construction safety within the USC area.
The first gas line was ruptured at the intersection of McClintock and Hellman Way near Cromwell Field on May 4 and resulted in a fire and the injury of one construction worker. The second leak occurred at Archimedes Plaza on May 30.
Steve Goldfarb, a fire safety and emergency planning specialist at USC, said the occurrence of more than one gas leak in a month is extremely rare and should not be seen as a cause for concern.
“[Having two gas leaks] is unusual, but it’s unusual to have gas leaks period,” Goldfarb said. “We work diligently with all these outside contractors who come in and do the work to make sure they know how to be safe and avoid these types of things.”
Because of these recent incidents, the university will also be reviewing safety procedures with construction crews to ensure all hazards are averted, Goldfarb said.
“Even though we did it prior to these happenings, we’re still going back and talking to all the contractors and reminding them to make sure they avoid that from ever happening again,” Goldfarb said. “We also make sure our contractors call our emergency number, and that activates our emergency response teams.”
Goldfarb said that the teams responded quickly in both cases. USC spread information about the leaks through its Trojan Alert system.
Madeline Berthold, a junior majoring in sociology, said the university should be more proactive in preventing these dangerous incidents from occurring and place more of a priority on completing projects in the safest way possible.
“It’s obvious that if there’s a gas leak that the construction crews need to be more careful when doing their work,” Berthold said. “It would be wrong for the [construction workers] to place speed and efficiency over the safety of students and themselves.”
Other students said the university handled the incident well. Rachel Bensimon, a sophomore majoring in communication, said she appreciated being notified through the Trojan Alert system.
“I go through the area near the [first] gas leak often, so I appreciated being notified that it was dangerous to be in the area at that time due to the ruptured gas line,” Bensimon said.

Voters near USC filtered into USC Hillel and Cardinal Gardens Tuesday to cast their ballots on a wide range of candidates and initiatives during California’s primary election.
Some of the key matters on the ballot include a senatorial primary, the Los Angeles district attorney race and Proposition 29, which would raise the tax on cigarette packs by $1.
Polls · Ballot stations for California’s primary election on Tuesday stand at the ready in Cardinal Gardens. Ballots included a senatorial primary, two state propositions and a district attorney race. - Briana Humphrey | Summer Trojan
 
Sara R. Tompson, head of instruction and orientation services at USC Libraries, said she was the only one at Hillel when she voted.
“I was hoping for a couple more, but I wasn’t really surprised since this is a student precinct and so many people are gone in the summer.”
Some students used an absentee ballot to participate in the election. One such student, Tony Martinez, a senior majoring in kinesiology, said he believes it is important to vote.
“You can’t complain about politics unless you put in your vote,” Martinez said.
For Martinez, the propositions were one of the significant matters on the ballot.
“Some of the propositions will be important because they will affect you in some way or another,” Martinez said.
Another initiative on the ballot, Proposition 28, would reduce the maximum amount of time that a politician could serve in the legislature to 12 years, but allow them to serve the full amount of time in either chamber. Currently, legislators can serve a maximum of 14 years: three two-year terms in the Assembly and two four-year terms in the Senate.
Tompson said she thinks more people would participate in the election if the California presidential primaries were scheduled before the nominees had been decided.
“People would like California’s primaries to be earlier,” Tompson said. “We have such a big population so we could make a big impact.”
Thanks to Daniel for a good, accurate reporting job!

Senior first baseman Matt Foat and freshman pitcher Stephen Tarpley were selected as all-Pac-12 honorable mention by a vote of the conference’s coaches.
Foat was the Trojans’ most productive and consistent hitter in what was a trying season offensively for USC.
The senior finished third on the team in batting and slugging with .323 batting average and .433 slugging percentage, and second in runs batted in and home runs with 27 and three, respectively.
Foat started 54 of the Trojans 55 games at first base, missing just one game because of the flu. He led the team in runs with 33; hits with 65; walks with 27 and in on-base percentage at a very impressive .429.
One of the best · Senior first baseman Matt Foat was named honorable mention all conference. He had a .323 batting average in 2012. - Corey Marquetti | Summer Trojan
Tarpley was a beacon of hope for the Trojans in their disappointing season. The freshman finished 5-4 with an impressive 3.22 ERA in 78 1/3 innings, second most on the team.
He also finished second on the team with 67 strikeouts. But his control was often suspect: The former eighth-round draft pick of the Cleveland Indians led the team in both walks, with 29, and hit batters, with 12.
Wrong again Mr. Burton… wrong again!
Tarpley finished the season 5-3 (not 5-4) Do a little research or actually watch a game for a change… In your defense, the Trojan stats pages are wrong too, thank goodness for the kid that Pac 12, UCLA, D1 Baseball.com and other responsible sources have it right… even USCTROJANS.COM got it right with their May 27th article stating… “Tarpley allowed five runs on eight hits while striking out three in 5 2/3 innings but took the no decision”.
The final game was re-tied long after Tarpley exited the game. 
And to think, this article was to congratulate both players (or just Matt Foat)?
Not to mention, Stephen Tarpley also had the team leading ERA of any STARTING pitcher, and he was THE ONLY WINNING STARTING PITCHER that USC had this year! Give the kid a break!  
It’s clear to see from your year-long omissions, your slants on the truth and the particular facts you CHOSE to present, that you clearly didn’t care much for this kid… as a sports writer that is your right.
I just couldn’t help but wonder what made this particular kid so different in your eyes? 
Congratulations Matt on your exclamation to a fine collegiate career and best of luck in the future!
Congratulations to you as well Mr. Tarpley that was an exciting season. You added a much needed winning presence around Dedeaux.
Even if the school media didn’t fully embrace you the fans sure did. We certainly had more students in attendance than I can remember seeing in quite a while.  And thanks again for signing my kid’s ball after the UCLA game; it was cool that you spent the extra time with him when you didn’t have to; you have a new fan for life! Best of luck next season!

Sophomore quarterback Jesse Scroggins will transfer from USC this summer, USC coach Lane Kiffin announced Monday.
Scroggins, who had been held back by academic issues and a thumb injury, did not log any pass attempts with the Trojans despite coming into the program as the No. 2 quarterback in the ESPN 150 in 2010.
Leaving Troy · Redshirt sophomore quarterback Jesse Scroggins (left) has decided to transfer from USC. The prized recruit from Lakewood battled injuries and academic ineligibility throughout his Trojan career. - Corey Marquetti | Summer Trojan
Scroggins suffered the injury during a training camp scrimmage in August and was forced to miss the first half of the 2011 season.
During that time, redshirt freshmen quarterbacks Cody Kessler and Max Wittek closed the gap on Scroggins, who had showed promise as a potential second-string quarterback behind junior Matt Barkley.
 
Once Scroggins recovered from his hand surgery, he took his one and only snap with USC — the last play of the Trojans’ 40-17 home win over the Washington Huskies on Nov. 12.
Scroggins missed more time during spring practice with a hip injury and was listed behind Kessler and Wittek in the end-of-spring depth chart.
Kiffin had also noted in February that Scroggins had “fallen behind” in the classroom and was in danger of being ruled academically ineligible for the upcoming season.
Scroggins plans to transfer to and play for a junior college and earn an Associate of Arts degree before transferring again to a four-year university with two years of eligibility remaining, according to his father, Jesse Sr.
“We’re just doing what’s in the best interest of my son. He wanted more control of the situation and this seemed like an opportune time,” Jesse Sr. told the Los Angeles Times.
Despite Scroggins’ academic struggles, Kiffin says that Scroggins had “a very strong spring semester in the classroom” and is “academically eligible to transfer at this time.”
“We wish Jesse and his family nothing but success,” Kiffin said.
The Lakewood High School product had committed to USC over Florida, LSU, Nebraska and Tennessee and was touted for his potential and a strong cannon arm.
The departure of Scroggins now has the Trojans scholarship roster set at 75, the reduced limit imposed by NCAA sanctions.
The Trojans have three scholarship quarterbacks on their roster in Barkley, Kessler and Wittek.
USC also has a verbal commit from quarterback Max Browne, who will be a senior at Skyline High School in Sammamish, Wash.
Browne, the No. 2 ranked pocket passer according to ESPN, plans on graduating early so he can enroll at USC in January and practice with the Trojans in spring 2013.

Sixth-ranked USC tied for 15th at the NCAA men’s golf championships, failing to qualify for match play. USC hosted the tournament at the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif., which began Tuesday, May 29, and ran until Sunday.
After starting the day tied for eighth place, USC finished the tournament tying for 15th at 28-over-880 (298-286-296).
After failing to qualify on the last day of stroke play, however, the Trojans were eliminated Thursday from further play in the NCAA golf championships.

On Thursday, the field of 32 swiftly declined to eight. The University of Texas clinched the NCAA championship on Sunday, defeating Alabama 3-2 and earning the third national title in program history.
Senior Steve Lim finished off his USC career by shooting a final round of 69, tying for 14th at 2-over-par 215 (74-72-69) with birdies on three holes.
“Steve looked great [Thursday],” USC coach Chris Zambri said in a statement. “I walked with him all three days this tournament. He was almost flawless [Thursday].”
Though the Trojans have improved greatly during the 2011-2012 season, Zambri believes that the program can continue to improve and earn the first championship title in program history.
“The tougher the course, the better we’ve got to be,” Zambri said. “In the fairways, on the greens, around the hole, in the end, we just need to be better. The guys had a good year and we accomplished some good things, but we need to be better.”
Junior Martin Trainer tied for 54th with a score of 8-over-par 221 (73-74-74). Sophomore Jeffrey Kang tied for 69th with 10-over-par 223 (75-71-77).
Tying for 77th, junior Sam Smith finished at 11-over-par 224 (79-69-76) while freshman phenom Anthony Paolucci tied for 140th at 20-over-par 233 (76-80-77).
USC finished the season with eight top-five finishes, including two first-place finishes in the Gifford Collegiate Championship and the NCAA Ann Arbor Regional.
USC has maintained the third-longest active streak in men’s golf, having made six straight appearances in the NCAA finals.
The future looks bright for the men’s golf team, as the program returns juniors Stewart Hagestad, Sam Smith, and Martin Trainer in addition to sophomores Jeffrey Kang, Ramsey Sahyoun, and freshman Anthony Paolucci.

This year’s annual “Beach Bummers” list by the nonprofit Heal the Bay shows that seven of the 10 dirtiest beaches in California are located in Los Angeles County. Topanga State, Cabrillo, Solstice Canyon, Escondido, Surfrider, Puerco and Avalon Harbor beaches all received failing grades.  Many of these beaches are repeat offenders — most notably, Avalon Harbor Beach has ranked as the worst in the last four of five years.
Pollution on our beaches and in our water won’t clear itself up, and L.A. shorelines play a large part in an economy that benefits greatly from tourism, not to mention oceanfront real estate. More importantly, poor water quality threatens marine life and throws off the delicate balance of the California coastline ecosystem. Los Angeles’ recent ban on plastic bags should improve the cleanliness of beach shores and slow growth of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, but improving water quality could be more difficult. As a major county with very progressive ideals, Los Angeles needs to hold itself to a higher standard when it comes to beaches and ocean water quality.
After all, high standards are possible for large, urban counties. San Francisco County maintains excellent quality beaches, with all locations receiving A or B grades. Additionally, Long Beach has made drastic improvements, with 93 percent of beaches receiving A or B grades this year after a $16-million investment from federal and state grants for water cleanup.
Hope is not lost for the failing Los Angeles County beaches. Malibu’s Paradise Cove beach is one success story: Last year it received an F grade from Heal the Bay, yet it has improved water quality to a B today, largely because of financial investment.
There are specific ways to target the causes of pollution. Take sewage runoff near beaches, for example, which stands as a significant source of beach and water pollution. Sewage pollution doesn’t just damage water quality; it also points out important problems in sewer infrastructure that need to be addressed regardless of beaches. And leaving aside the problem of water and beach pollution to deal with at a later time only exacerbates the problem and makes it costlier to fix in the future.
Because of the 2008 budget cuts to water testing, beaches have relied on state and federal grants as well as volunteer testing to continue upkeep.  As some of these grants run out this year, we must wonder what the state of water quality will be in the future. Poor water quality can result in beach closures and further damage the ecosystem, perhaps irreparably if left too long.
Though it’s never an easy choice in a difficult economy, Los Angeles needs to reinvest in improving water quality in coming years despite budget concerns.  Beaches and the ocean need to be preserved for the future, and it’s practically unethical to leave the ever-inflating repair bill for later generations.
To put it simply: The water can’t clean itself up. Action is needed, now.

By the time you read this, voters will have already entered the California primaries to check off on a number of candidates and ballot measures.  One of these measures, Proposition 29, stands to have been the most contentious of the ballot boxes.  Prop 29 adds a $1 tax on each pack of cigarettes, generating more than $700 million annually for research on cancer and other smoking-related diseases, and allots 20 percent of funds for California’s education and health programs concerning tobacco use.
For the most part, this measure makes sense: Tobacco-related health problems stand as a significant element of health care costs in the country, and any effort to mitigate them is an honorable cause.  Regardless of what voters decided on Tuesday, Prop 29 serves as a prime example of well-intentioned legislation that can win voters’ sympathy while smokescreening gaping faults.
“Gaping faults,” in this case, refers to the way the measure doesn’t clarify where the hundreds of millions of tax dollars generated by Prop 29 can be spent.  Namely, it doesn’t keep the money in California: No language in the measure states that the money must fund research and development in California.
You don’t need to be a political science major to understand that the Golden State sits submerged in budgetary concerns, and it boils down to one basic, aggravating problem: We don’t have money. Prop 29 certainly doesn’t help.
Though we can hope that the nine-person oversight committee — composed of California-based representatives such as UC chancellors and researchers — will invest more money back into the state, nothing about Prop 29 demands this. In essence, the tax can fund national efforts — and though that’s a wonderfully ethical effort, it’s a completely impractical approach in light of the state’s budget woes.
Practical issues aside, the story of Prop 29 revolves around the public’s rally around a sensitive issue — cancer and other tobacco-related diseases — that often encourages sympathetic action. It’s natural to want to support the measure; who doesn’t want to support cancer research?
A  recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll showed support of the measure at 62 percent. It’s fair to assume that this stems from the fact that most voters don’t smoke, making it tempting for vote for the measure. It’s a legitimate stance, if a bit insensitive to the rights of tobacco users.
Still, that doesn’t mean citizens should turn a blind eye to the faults of the measure, because there’s still a way to make Prop 29 an effective piece of state legislation.
The problem of Prop 29 doesn’t lie in what the measure does, but how it does it: Namely, taking money out of Californian pockets to wait in a locked fund for distribution potentially across the country.
There needs to be money and attention paid toward cancer and tobacco-related disease research. But what the state needs is a measure that treats the state as the priority, because it is the priority.
Instead, Prop 29 treats California merely as a tool, putting state dollars on the line without specifics on how — and where — the cash will flow.

James, smokers are barely allowed to smoke anywhere now.  And the few places they are able to, they are still confronted by people about it.  
I have been smoking for about 20 years and I can still run a mile in less than 7 minutes.  But according to “tests” I should be bed ridden and dying because smoking should have given me cancer because I walked through a cloud of my own smoke.
Find an actual proven case of second hand smoke causing cancer.  And you can’t just hop on google, because even though there are plenty of sites that will say “yes”, none of them will be backed by any autopsy studies confirming the deaths.  If 50,000 people died of second hand smoke this year…who were they?  Do you know anyone that died of it?  I sure don’t.
That’s how things are done.  Misinformation.  Find something you don’t like, make a believable article.  Convince everyone.  Dress your unemployed brother up as a doctor.  Have him give a speech that rice cakes cause cancer.  Give a believable amount of deaths per year…we will say 1,500 died of congestive heart failure because some people ate too many rice cakes because their internal organs shut down due to cancer causing their bodies to not be able to process the foodstuffs.  Now I’m not a doctor…are you?  But sure, I guess that can be believable because “a doctor said so, and who is going to say different”.
But of course you won’t believe anything like this until you see it from someone else.  Because a smoker is telling you, and he is just defending smokers from another un-needed tax that will do nothing it says it is going to do.  So automatically that makes me a liar because you have a profound hate for me and nothing I say will be true beause I am a filthy smoker.  I’m not going to bother trying to convince you otherwise, but when a tax comes up about something you enjoy…remember how easily you were convinced about a tax that affects others.
And like the commercials say…”I’m not a smoker, so this tax won’t affect me”.  Yes it will, because that will be the logic for taxing something else that only affects one side of the population.
John Doe, if you were a smoker who had enough income to pay for your medical expenses that will inevitably come from your smoking and you smoked in an area that no non-smokers would be affected, fine.  But the vast majority of smokers are not like that, and for that reason I will always vote for tax spikes.  Again, enjoy lung cancer, though.
And here is another one for you…Every comment against this prop is replied with “You’re a smoker, aren’t you?”
Very prejudice.  That’s why it is so easy to throw on another tobacco tax.
Wow John Doe, you are an idiot.  Comparing tobacco to sugar?  Last time I checked, I can enjoy a candy bar without endangering the lives of those around me.  You can’t say the same about tobacco.  Enjoy lung cancer, jerk.
Mike is from Canada, Bettina.  We have something called “The Constitution” and it is being violated more and more by new propositions like this all the time.  Are you aware that tobacco is a product and it is being taxed more than it is worth?  Look at all the laws against tobacco users compared to how things were…20 years ago.  People HATE smokers, so when something comes up that burdens them, the non smokers go all for it.  Can’t smoke in bars/buildings…that is a violation of property owners rights.  Property owners are supposed to be able to manage their own rules.  Look up “property rights” and see what has been done using voters as a weapon against something someone else doesn’t like.  Maybe sugar should be looked at like tobacco.  Sugar has more noticable health risks than tobacco.  Look how many obese people there are.  Would you vote on Prop 29 if it was a sugar tax?
So you want to vote for this prop 29 that has no accountability or any clause saying it’s generated tax dollars don’t have to be spent in California, and no changes can be made to the prop for 15 years?  Go ahead.  And be sure to vote yes on the prop that comes out that suggests rounding up tobacco users in camps to execute them.
Betsy, I’m guessing you’re a smoker!!!
“Money for research needs to go to the best researchers,period.” (as Mike stated)
Yet,researchers,cancer patients will never see a penny if Prop 29 passes. ACS is a Global Anti-Smoking/Tobacco enforcer masquerading as a ‘Cancer Charity”. Research them-Vote NO on 29.
Big Tobacco looks like Mother Theresa compared to ACS.
Eddie, let me guess, you’re a smoker yourself.  The issue has little to do with where the money goes.  Hell, it could be burned for all I care.  The point is that smoking affects non-smokers as well.  Anytime you exit a building, attempt to walk (even on the USC campus), you will inevitably experience a cloud of cigarette smoke.  Moreover, any statistical measure will show that increase in smoking tax rates leads to lower rates.  Not to mention the health care costs involved.  It is no secret that the poorer demographic of America tends to have the higher smoking rates.  These individuals tend to not have the proper health care plans to treat any cancers or illnesses resulting from their smoking.  This tab is picked up by tax payers, putting a burden on all of us.  You should focus more on these issues rather than where the money goes.
Terrible article. (Great timing though!) 
If you are collecting money to go towards research you have an obligation to make sure that the very best research projects are being funded, regardless of location.  To suggest that all research dollars should be confined to a single state boundary is ludicrous.     
There are tons of fantastic research universities in California.  All they have to do is write an A+ grant proposal and they will get funded.
The editorial mixes apples and oranges.  Voters aren’t voting on a proposition to raise taxes for general revenues.  They’re voting on using a tax on a commodity to directly address harm done in the State by that commodity.  Money spent of cancer research will benefit cancer patients in California.  Period.  If another proposition adds to the tobacco tax for money earmarked for Cancer treatment for Californians, That’s another proposition.
In Canada, smokers pay $12 per pack, most of that taxes, all going to government’s general revenue.  They use it to pay for medical services but they don’t have to use it for anything.  This drop in the bucket for the consumer of tobacco generating millions of dollars annually for a cure is powerful.
If the editorial were to be fair, it should have commented on the counter-argument that a restrictive, “money spent in California only” provision were there, it may preclude funding for research done jointly by different hospitals and universities.   Money for cancer research needs to go to the best researchers, period.
Thanks Mike. You just convinced me to vote yes.
