It was a typical Friday night for Angel Dust. In a cramped restroom tucked away on the second floor of West Hollywood’s Rage Nightclub, an epic transformation was well underway. With the help of her backup dancer and friend Irvin, Angel was about to become the fiercest woman in town — all that was missing was a sequin overcoat and pair of glossy, knee-high hooker boots to complete her sparkly (and very pink) ensemble. Twenty minutes, a slice of pizza and dozens of selfies with drunk strangers later, Angel was ready to take the stage.
After a showstopping lip-synced rendition of Ciara’s “1, 2 Step,” Angel confidently exited the packed dance floor and retreated upstairs, escorted by her team of dancers. She was content; a five-minute performance and several dollars in tips was all Angel needed to have a good time.
For Angel Zayas, the mastermind behind drag persona Angel Dust, performing was never just a dream — it was what he was born to do. However, he never seriously considered pursuing drag until he came to USC. After a couple of ragtag performances at Ground Zero Performance Café and a gay bar in Pomona, Zayas fell in love with drag and discovered the diva that had been inside him all along.
It was then that Angel Dust turned from a figment of Zayas’ imagination into a reality.
“It was always a piece of me that was inside,” said Zayas, a junior majoring in theatre. “I’ve had this vision of Angel Dust as a pop star for a very long time.”
A self-proclaimed “conceptual performer,” Angel Dust believes that bigger — and pinker — is better. Now a regular performer at Rage Nightclub, the drag diva has been gaining prominence in both the USC and greater Los Angeles drag scenes. At the Queer Student and Ally Student Assembly’s annual drag show last November, Angel Dust received a standing ovation for her larger-than-life performance complete with show tricks and a handful of uniformed backup dancers.
While Angel Dust encapsulates the confidence and exuberance of true diva, Zayas said this attitude demands almost as much construction as the elaborate costumes he performs in. In fact, getting into the character of Angel Dust requires quite a bit of mental preparation and method acting on Zayas’ part.
“Because Angel Dust is what I imagine a modern-day pop star [to be] … I have to get in the mindset that I’m more important than I am,” he said. “For example, a lot of drag queens don’t have managers or assistants and stuff like that. I do because that helps me get into the fantasy.”
Beyond the makeup and the mindset, Zayas said it’s not the technical stage skills that make a performer memorable — rather, it’s their ability to captivate the audience.
“You don’t have to be the best makeup artist, you don’t have to be best dancer, you don’t have to be the best lip-syncer,” Zayas said. “If you are, which only a few people can be — amazing. But can you control an audience? Can you look at them once and make them freeze? That’s captivation, and it’s something you can’t teach. I, for a long time, really struggled with this idea.”
Beyond his love for performing, Zayas has been involved in various aspects of the queer community at USC. He previously worked as resident assistant for Century Apartments’ Rainbow Floor, a special interest housing community for LGBTQ+ students. Zayas was also a student worker at the LGBT Resource Center, where he met his mentor Kelby Accardi-Harrison.
Accardi-Harrison recalls meeting Zayas during his first year at USC, when he proposed the idea of starting a drag club at the University. According to her, Zayas was outspoken and determined to see his ideas through from the start.
“I really appreciated his honesty and his vision for what he wanted to see for our student community,” Accardi-Harrison said.
While at USC, Zayas has actively worked to establish stronger ties in the campus community through drag. According to Zayas, drag has the ability to bring people together — even for those who do not identify as queer.
“I think drag can build bridges between communities that [don’t] mesh well, like queer people and non-queer people,” he said. ”Once they find out about drag and understand it and are educated about it, they’re likely to be more receptive to it.”
Zayas’ idea is a reflection of the mainstream success of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” a reality competition show for drag performers that first aired in 2009. Now considered a cultural phenomenon, “Drag Race” revolutionized public perception of drag and made the art form more accessible to non-queer communities.
Under Zayas’ direction, last year’s annual drag show reached maximum capacity at 500, the attendance record in its nine-year history. The event also introduced a new crop of drag queens, such as Bunny Bloodlust and Annie Vaxxer.
“Drag has always existed in all aspects of life, so it’s not like I was the first drag queen to ever walk onto campus, but I will say that it really helped that I came to USC at a time when ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ came into the mainstream,” Zayas said. “When I started drag, it wasn’t considered cool to do drag.”
Angel Dust has already made big plans for her career. While she recently applied for season 12 of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” Angel said she won’t be discouraged if she doesn’t get cast.
“If season 11 were the last season, I’m still going to be a famous drag queen,” she said. “It’s not going to stop me.”
In addition to serving as QuASA’s director next year, Zayas also added that he is working to develop a one-woman show for Angel Dust, which he hopes to perform sometime next year.
“My goal is to take drag where it’s never gone,” Zayas said. “No one’s ever done a two-hour show that’s like a concert or tour so that’s something I want to do. I want to trail blaze the same way RuPaul did in the ’90s.”
According to alumna and Zayas’ friend Nicole Medina, the future is bright for both Angel Zayas and Angel Dust.
“I either see him turning a drag race stint into a lot of club gigs and going on that world tour or, if for some reason ‘Drag Race’ doesn’t pan out … I see him doing drag and other performances, possibly acting,” Medina said. “I see him performing and being successful and developing tons of relationships and a fan base out here in L.A. at minimum, if not nationally and internationally.”

The Norman Topping Student Aid Fund Governing Board officially ratified its Charter of 2019, a legally binding constitutional document that establishes the legitimacy of the Fund into USC bylaws, Monday. 
The ratification of the charter, a 20-page document that details the relationship between the Fund and the University, marks the end of the program’s restructuring since Christina Yokoyama was terminated from her position as Topping director last spring. Since Yokoyama’s elimination, members of Topping — a student-funded, student-led scholarship program founded in 1972 for underrepresented, low-income and first-generation students — looked to revise its 1982 charter.
“[The charter] provides for many protocols and procedures that will protect both the integrity of the Board and the Fund,” NTSAF Governing Board Chair Dustin Wong wrote in a memo to the Topping Scholar Community Tuesday. “But most importantly for you, it is our promise as the Governing Board to forge a more responsive and valuable Topping experience for current and future scholars.”
According to the memo, the Board can now review the Fund’s budget to help the Topping community grow in a “responsible manner.” New regulations set in place include enabling Topping alumni to reapply for graduate-level funding in 2020, creating programming that carries more relevance to the diverse Topping community and establishing a difference between undergraduate Topping Scholars and graduate Topping Fellows. 
“The Fund’s student body composition will be no less than 30% and no more than 50% Fellows by the year 2023,” Topping Scholar representatives Jennifer Leal and Lucero Noyola wrote in a letter to the Topping community Wednesday. “Meaning, we will increase the number of graduates in Topping in the coming years.”
Wong said that from the late 1990s to 2017, the Fund experienced what is considered an “information dark age”; there was no trace of historical documents, annual reports, Board meeting minutes or other important information. 
“It’s as if the Governing Board didn’t exist to function during those years,” Wong said. “And we’ve got a couple documents here and there, but not substantiated. Not many of them not dated as well, and so as a period of this decline, what we saw as a correlation at the same time, is that the Governing Board and its responsibilities started to diminish.”
Until Monday, the Fund operated in accordance with its former charter from 1982. However, according to Wong, the rules and regulations in the 1982 charter failed to apply to changes in the Fund and the University. For example, the Fund moved from the Division of Student Affairs to the Office of Undergraduate Programs. As a result, it became the norm that the Board not strictly follow the operational guidelines listed in the charter.
“That became a major issue for the Provost’s Office and for the University, because not only were we not in compliance with our own rules and own legal documents … [but we were] also no longer legally compliant with California state laws or federal laws or University bylaws,” Wong said. “And so, in light of the situation, there would be a need for restructuring to take place.”
According to Leal and Noyola’s letter, since the University is undergoing a change in leadership with President-elect Carol Folt as well as replacements for outgoing Provost Michael Quick and former Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, the charter may have to go through several updates in the coming year.
“The Board worked hard to ratify a charter before this change occurs, so some topics, though still important, were tabled for after the ratification,” the letter read. “Next year, the Board will work on creating the Fund’s operating guidelines, while also working to address tabled topics.”
Wong said that with the new charter, the Board is on the path to creating positive change within the Fund and the University.
“I want this to be, you know, a positive sign in the midst of all the University scandals, you know, of the fact that [Quick] is resigning, that we’re gonna have new president, etc., that almost all these different issues that, you know, we’ve actually managed to come together and put some positive, something positive in the news,” Wong said.

Over his 40 years in the USC athletic department, sports information director Tim Tessalone treasures two specific memories the most.
The first came in 1979, his very first year working in the department. It was a small memory, one of many that Tessalone would collect over the next four decades. In the final minutes of a blowout over UCLA, as Tessalone traipsed down the stairs from the Coliseum press box to the field, backup tailback Michael Hayes subbed in for Charley White. 
Hayes wasn’t a star. He worked clean-up for a guy who went on to win the Heisman and become All-Pro in the NFL. He rushed for zero yards until his senior year, when he picked up a little over 500 yards as a stacked Trojan team rolled to an undefeated finish and a Rose Bowl win. But as Tessalone walked onto the field, he watched Hayes do something special in an otherwise lackluster fourth quarter. 
Hayes burst through a hole, sprinted 20 yards and somersaulted into the endzone. It was Hayes’ first and only touchdown of his college career, and he celebrated as if it was the game winner. For Tessalone, the moment captured everything that had drawn him to sports in the first place.
“It’s easy to talk about the stars and remember all those great players,” Tessalone said. “But for every one of those there’s 20 kids who ride the bench and don’t get their moment in the sun. This kid got his moment. It was small, it didn’t really mean anything to the game, but he got his moment. There’s been a million of those moments since, and to me, that’s what athletics is about.”
It has been four decades since that moment. Tessalone is now a staple of USC athletics, entering his 40th year working full-time in sports information and having served as the head SID since 1984. 
Tessalone grew up in Los Angeles, rooting for both USC and Notre Dame, oddly enough. He entered USC hoping to be a sportswriter but quickly switched to public relations, then interned with the sports department as a senior.
After college, however, he left USC for a few years to work at a public relations agency that served financial firms, the Motion Picture Academy and, most importantly, the Rose Bowl. Being on the sidelines for the Rose Bowl each year made him miss USC and the atmosphere of a sports department.
So in 1979, the same year that a sports channel called ESPN launched and Jimmy Carter was president, Tessalone returned to USC as an assistant sports director. He hasn’t left since. 
Tessalone has weathered eras of USC football, from the championship-drought decades of the 1980s and 1990s to Pete Carroll’s dynasty and the ensuing sanctions. He’s managed four Heisman campaigns, from Charley White to Matt Leinart. And in his time, he’s become one of only 12 media members to be inducted into the USC Athletics Hall of Fame.
“I don’t need to see a poll to know that Tim is at the top of the list,” said Fred Claire, the former general manager of the Dodgers and Tessalone’s long-time friend. “I have seen his work and the performance of his team members play out year after year with outstanding performance. At a time when integrity and credibility come into question in the world of sports, Tim stands as an example of always doing the right thing.”
A lot has changed since Tessalone first walked into his job. The sports information department used to consist of just three people: the SID, an assistant SID and a secretary. The internet had not been invented yet, and social media didn’t exist. Despite the popularity of the USC football team, Tessalone considered his job well done if the Los Angeles Times beat writer popped his head into practice every few weeks.
Now, everything about the job of sports information director is more demanding. Tessalone oversees a staff of seven sports information directors and student workers. His job description includes running a website and social media accounts while managing the football press corps — typically at least 10 beat writers — that attends every single practice and scrimmage.
And perhaps the greatest challenge of the job now is social media, which allows young athletes to access the media wherever and whenever, without oversight from the sports information department.
“It used to be that all we talked to [players] about was media relations and how to do an interview,” Tessalone said. “Now, that’s only half of our conversation. Social media is the other half.” 
Although Tessalone joked that social media keeps him up at night, he’s found that the values he held at the start of his career remain the same now. At the end of the day, his goal as sports information director is to help athletes tell their stories. He’s never believed in sheltering athletes or keeping them from the press. While many other schools deny access to freshmen or only allow coaches to comment after losses, USC athletes face the media win or lose, taking hard questions even after blowouts. 
It’s why head coaches like Andy Enfield feel their players are always comfortable with the media because of Tessalone’s ability to relate to them. It’s why countless athletes, from Keyshawn Johnson to Sam Darnold, believe they are more prepared for the professional leagues than players from any other school. While coaches are preparing their players on the field and the court, Tessalone is the quiet force in the background prepping them from everything that comes after the buzzer.
“Our philosophy is that for our athletes, dealing with the media is part of their educational experience here,” Tessalone said. “That’s why we’ve never really shielded our athletes like some other places do. We think that if they’re properly educated and trained, that this is part of the total athlete experience.”
One example is former linebacker Rey Maualuga. When Maualuga entered USC as a freshman, he could barely hold eye contact with a reporter, answering in broken half-sentences and struggling to speak up loudly enough for recorders. But rather than pulling him from scrums, Tessalone continued to encourage the young player, gently preparing him to face the media each week.
By his senior year, Maualuga was almost unrecognizable as a confident All-American who easily spoke in public. When he won the Chuck Bednarik Award for college defensive player of the year, Maualuga put on a tuxedo, stood up in front of a crowd of thousands and gave a full speech without notes for almost 20 minutes. To Tessalone, that growth was as important as any progress he made on the football field.
To manage this ever-increasing flow of information about his teams, Tessalone has to be constantly on-duty. He works seven days a week from August to January for football season, then six days a week for the rest of the year. In June and July, over summer break, he can take a breather for a little bit before the next season begins.
It also means that, even though he probably cares more about USC football than any non-coach or player in the country, Tessalone can never be a normal fan. During each game, he’s at work, keeping stats, watching the field and coordinating with reporters. Even when Tessalone went to a Rams game on a day off, he couldn’t quite figure out how to cheer along with the rest of the crowd.
“I’m a USC fan, there’s no doubt about it,” Tessalone said. “But there’s no cheering in the press box. I can’t remember the last time that I clapped. For me, it’s a weird feeling to sit in the stands anymore. That cheering gene is no longer active.”
Tessalone’s work ethic, according to colleagues, is unparalleled. Assistant SID Paul Goldberg says that the image of Tessalone, with a pen tucked behind his ear and a carefully folded to-do list in his back pocket, has become one of the iconic images of the school’s athletic department.
“That kind of symbolizes who he is,” Goldberg said. “He is ready to jump into action on anything at any time.” 
Whether it’s on or off the field, Tessalone is known as the guy who always shows up. That’s always been the case in the 23 years that Tessalone and Goldberg have worked together. When Goldberg’s first son was born, Tessalone came to the hospital unannounced. Thirteen years later, he was in the crowd for the same kid’s recital.
Tessalone works with athletes during their college careers, but he is known for showing up for them in every step that comes afterward — games, weddings, funerals. This stems from his desire to help each athlete, starters or benchwarmers, to grow through their years at USC.
“I think what also keeps him going is his natural role as a mentor — and a university is a great place to serve in that role,” Goldberg said. “He derives a real satisfaction and enjoyment from helping students advance in their careers and never turns away anyone who has a question. I cannot count the number of people who have sought his counsel. His door is always open.”
Over time, this sense of community has helped Tessalone embrace the idea — however cheesy — of the Trojan Family.
It makes sense, after all, given that his own family is part of that community as well. He met his wife at USC when they both lived in the dorms. All three of his children — the eldest of whom is named Troy — attended their parents’ alma mater. For Tessalone, USC is his career, home and family all wrapped into one.
“It’s a hokey concept, the Trojan Family,” Tessalone said. “People from the outside don’t get it, but it is a very real thing. Trojans love each other and take care of each other. Just to see them move on in life, whatever they do, that’s what’s really cool.”
Over all these years, more than perhaps anyone except for band director Arthur Bartner, Tessalone has seen it all. 
He watched football players hold up a student who impaled herself on a fence after falling out of a dorm window. He kept the team calm as turbulence knocked players’ heads against the airplane ceiling on a flight to Notre Dame. He sat in front of his idol, Muhammad Ali, at a private screening of his film “When We Were Kings,” listening to the star mumble along narration out of the corner of his mouth.
But none of those are his other favorite memory of USC.
In fact, he didn’t have a second favorite up until last year. That flipping touchdown by Hayes was his favorite, hands down. But then, he watched the women’s 4×400 meter team come back to win the national championship in 2018, and Tessalone was forced to add another favorite.
“To see that comeback — and I’ve been around some pretty cool comebacks — that was maybe the single greatest USC athletic feat in any sport that I’ve ever seen,” Tessalone said. 
The race quickly became a national sensation. Senior anchor Kendall Ellis started the final leg of the race in fifth place and tore up the first place runner’s 100-meter lead to lunge forward for a last-second win. It was one of the best things Tessalone had ever seen at USC, better even than the 1974 comeback over Notre Dame that he watched from the stands as a student.
The fact that Ellis used to be an intern for the athletic department only made the comeback sweeter. For Tessalone, it was a culmination of four years of watching yet another athlete grow both on and off the track.
“That, to me, is the coolest part of the job,” Tessalone said. “It’s not the wins and losses, it’s not the superstars and champions. It’s watching athletes grow from freshmen to seniors and knowing that we might have touched them a little bit.”

The USC baseball team lost 12-9 to UC Irvine Tuesday in a night game at Dedeaux Field. 
Sophomore pitcher Brian Gursky started the game for the Trojans, and UCI wasted no time getting on the scoreboard. With runners on first and second, junior infielder Adrian Damla singled to right center, scoring an Anteater and pushing another to third base. Damla’s hit was followed by another RBI single to increase the Anteaters’ early lead to 2 runs. Another two singles followed to score two more Anteaters and make the game 4-0. 
USC head coach Dan Hubbs substituted Gursky for freshman pitcher Chandler Champlain. UCI would score again on a fielder’s choice. The inning ended with the Anteaters up 5-0.
With junior center fielder Matthew Acosta on first, freshman catcher Clay Owens smashed a fastball over the right field fence for his second home run of the season, cutting UCI’s lead to three in the bottom of the second. 
Junior right fielder Brady Shockey followed up an RBI double by freshman catcher Tyler Lozano by crushing a 2-run shot over the right field wall that tied the game 5-5 in the bottom of the fourth. 
A pair of RBI singles by Acosta and sophomore third baseman Ben Ramirez tacked on 2 more runs for the Trojans while a 2-run single by Lozano extended USC’s lead to four in the bottom of the fifth. 
In the sixth inning, the Anteaters started their comeback. Two straight singles put runners on first and second for freshman infielder Andre Antone, who catapulted a fast ball to left field. Mazur and Koss both rounded the bases to reach home, cutting the Trojan lead to 2 runs. 
A groundout advanced Antone to third base. A walk by Champlain put another Anteater on base, and the righty was subbed out for freshman pitcher Carson Lambert. 
“I thought Champlain did a great job for us,” Hubbs said. “I might have left him out there too long and that’s on me.”
With two outs left, the Trojans hoped to escape the inning with a lead. However, Damla drove his third hit of the night to right field and scored two more Anteaters to tie the game 9-9.
UCI got a pair of runners on base in the seventh after a walk and throwing error by Lambert. Sophomore pitcher John Beller stepped in for Lambert and delivered a strikeout to strand both runners and end the inning. 
As the game entered the ninth frame, both teams hoped for just one more inning of offense to put the game away. Sophomore pitcher Kyle Hurt replaced John Beller and retired three straight batters to close out the top of the inning while UCI returned the favor and retired three to close out the bottom of the frame and send the game into extras. 
UCI moved ahead in extras with a stroke of luck when freshman catcher Tyler Lozano fumbled a wild pitch, allowing freshman second baseman Sam Ireland to score from third. Junior pitcher Chris Clarke stepped in to relieve Hurt after the righty hit an Anteater with a pitch, but followed with a wild pitch of his own that allowed sophomore left fielder Mike Peabody to score. A UCI single immediately after made the game 12-9, and the Anteaters retired the side to end the game. 
USC’s record drops to 17-21-1. The Trojans now look ahead to a non-conference series against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. First pitch is at 6 p.m. Friday in San Luis Obispo. 
“We played hard today — our bats were hot and we did a lot of good things,” Hubbs said. “You hate to lose one like this but we’ll take the positives, make some adjustments and move on to SLO”.

No. 2 USC is preparing to host the Pac-12 Tournament beginning Thursday. USC trails behind only UCLA in the Pac-12 and will face off against Washington at home in the first round.
The Trojans concluded their regular season last Thursday with two victories over Grand Canyon University and Cal Poly on Senior Day. The team showcased strong play in these final matchups, winning both by a score of 4-1. With these victories, the Trojans completed an eight-game winning streak to cap off another strong regular season record of 24-4.
Senior Abril Bustamante and sophomore Tina Graudina were both steady forces for the Trojans at the top court as they finished with a commanding 26-2 match record for the season. Graduate student Alexandra Poletto and sophomore Haley Hallgren matched them with a 26-2 record of their own. Both of these duos are trending upward at the right time as well, having won their last eight matches.
“We all changed our mindset [toward the end of the season],” Hallgren said. “We each focused on our own individual court, which eventually led to team wins.”
The Trojans last played the Huskies in the Pac-12 North Invitational and defeated them 5-0. Many of the sets were decided by large margins, and USC was especially successful at the top two positions. The Huskies finished their season with an 8-14 record and earned the seventh seed in the tournament. They are 2-4 in their last six games, and the Trojans hope to capitalize on this favorable matchup.
“The beginning of the season matters, but it is all about the end,” Hallgren said. “[We] want to be the last team to get the win.”
If USC defeats Washington, it  will then face the winner of the Cal-Arizona State game Thursday. Cal is currently the higher ranked seed, and they defeated the Sun Devils 5-0 in their only matchup this season. 
USC will take on the Huskies to kick off the Pac-12 Tournament  at Merle Norman Stadium at 3 p.m. Thursday.

The USC women’s lacrosse team will play in the Pac-12 Tournament this weekend as it heads back to Eugene, Ore. for a chance at the conference championship. The odds seem to be in the Trojans’ favor after they secured their first-ever Pac-12 regular-season title last weekend against Arizona State. 
It is the third regular-season league championship for USC, which won Mountain Pacific Sports Federation crowns in 2016 and 2017. The win over ASU brought the Trojans up to 5-0 all-time against Arizona State and helped them secure the top seed in the second annual Pac-12 Women’s Lacrosse Tournament. USC will meet the winner between fifth-seeded Arizona State and fourth-seeded California in the first semifinal game Friday at Papé Field. 
USC has played both teams twice this season, winning each by a huge margin. Should the Trojans win their semifinal matchup against either team, they will advance to the championship game set for Sunday. 
USC’s main focus leading up to the tournament is properly executing details and continuing to improve communication among players to ensure precision and effectiveness against either ASU or Cal. In its most recent match against the Sun Devils, USC was taken out of its rhythm in the early going, unable to score until nearly 10 minutes into the game. With the pressure amping up, USC quickly racked up 3 goals in two minutes, aided by two free-position goals.
The win allowed the Trojans to finish off their regular season with a victory and also gave the graduating players a memorable final match at McAlister Field. 
“With it most likely being the final game we would get to play at McAlister Field this year, as a senior, I really wanted to play my best and be able to know I gave it my all,” senior defender Jackie Gilbert said.
Gilbert has been one of the team’s top contributors defensively and was recently named Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week for her stellar performance at the ASU game. This is Gilbert’s second Pac-12 honor this season and also the second of her career. She is one of six Trojans to earn the title this season. 
“I would love for us to be able to play our best and be able to go out on top but we need to take it game by game first,” Gilbert said.   
Stanford has been a strong competitor this season and will likely face USC in Sunday’s final match. In its most recent match against Stanford, Cal was defeated 17-6, ending the Bears’ regular season with a tough loss. 
Last year, the Trojans fell to the Cardinal during the semifinals and were eliminated from the tournament. Stanford went on to sweep the field against Colorado and ultimately won the inaugural tournament in Boulder.
USC has already competed against Stanford twice this year, with both matches ending in a Trojan victory.  
As they look to secure a spot in the national championship, the Trojans must bring their A-game to Eugene Friday at 4:30 p.m.

Zachary Barack, a junior currently on leave from school, pronounces his last name “bear-ick,” like army barracks — not “Barack,” like Obama. Like any student who needs to correct a professor’s pronunciation on the first day of class, Barack is going to need to ensure that his name is pronounced correctly, but, for him, it’s not just for commencement. 
Instead, Barack needs his name pronounced correctly because it could soon become one of the household variety. He will make his big-screen debut this summer in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” to be released July 5.
Admittedly, Barack hasn’t had much time to nail down the public’s pronunciation of his name, and if his ascent feels especially meteoric, that’s because it is. Prior to appearing in the 23rd film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe alongside Academy Award-nominated actors and industry heavyweights, Barack had only one other formal acting job, playing a recovering alcoholic in an industrial tape for social work students, accessible only with paid academic access.
To claim that Barack’s ascent is a result of pure happenstance, however, is to misunderstand his disparate interests — and multi-hyphenate star potential.
Barack first came to USC as a music industry major, fresh out of a gap year spent working at a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. At the time, he was interested in what he described as “management type stuff.” Still, Barack was keenly aware of his other passions.
“[I knew] I loved acting,” he said. “I loved comedy, I loved music.”
When his roommate notified him about an open casting call online for a role on NBC’s short-lived musical drama series “Rise,” Barack decided to submit an audition, despite his primary focus on music at the time.
“The truth is, at the end of the day, I wanted to perform,” Barack said.
He didn’t get the role, but he did get a call from Ann Thomas, who runs Transgender Talent, expressing her interest in working with Barack. Around the same time, Barack started doing stand-up comedy, something which he says gave him the confidence he needed to perform in front of others.
With Thomas’ assistance, Barack started going on more formal auditions. He had only been on four auditions in total when Thomas called to give him some career-making news.
“So, I think you got a role in Spider-Man,” Barack remembers her saying over the phone. 
Barack, who hadn’t formally auditioned for the role, was in a state of shock and glee. Thomas went on to explain that those involved with the film had seen Barack’s other audition tapes and wanted him to come in for an official audition that day.
Luckily, Barack, a Chicago native, was still in Los Angeles for a summer internship, so he was able to audition.
Barack assumed he didn’t get the part when he didn’t hear back for a whole week, knowing that the team said they would move quickly with hiring. Soon after though, he got a call from his agent.
He remembers two voices on the phone whispering, “Do you want to tell him? Should I tell him?”
The phone call remains vivid for Barack, whose life changed considerably as a result of it.
“It happened in the span of a week,” he said.
He overnighted his passport (production was primarily based in the United Kingdom), packed up his entire apartment, went home to Chicago for two days and then got on a plane to London. With that, his film career officially began.
Barack was provided a phone and a place to stay, both of which helped his adjustment. Within the first few days of his arrival, there was also a cast dinner.
“It was just surreal, that first dinner,” Barack said. “I went out and bought a whole new outfit that day, and then everyone [else] was in T-shirts and boots. I was like, ‘Oh, everybody’s so normal.’”
Barack bonded with his castmates, who quickly became friends.
“When I first got out there, I really clammed up,” Barack said. “I’m clearly the newest to this. [But] then, I slowly started to view myself in the same lens as other folks.
As Barack built his support system on set, an old support system also visited; his mom, Merle Diamond, and one of his three older brothers stopped by to see Barack in London.
For Barack’s mother, who remembers Barack’s steadfast commitment to performing when he was young, seeing her child on a movie set felt like the culmination of years of work.
“I just thought, ‘This is who he was supposed to be,’” Diamond said. “Zach just always knew that he was going to do something like this. This is exactly the way it’s supposed to be.” 
Being part of such a big project does bring its own challenges, though.
“As a young actor, there’s a lot of insecurity,” Barack said. “[Then], as a trans person, a lot of the comments I get — on articles, on Instagram posts — are like, ‘I sure hope he can act.’ And they’re not saying that to everybody, you know? There does feel like an extra level of pressure.”
Since returning from the 18-week project this semester, Barack has remained focused on honing his evident talent.
“I want to get better,” Barack said. “I want to take this time to heal, to improve, to grow.”
Barack has started looking into even more coaching for his acting. He has also connected with friends from the School of Cinematic Arts and has an “accountability buddy” who helps keep him focused on writing songs, stand-up and film and television projects.
Meanwhile, he’s shot two major television projects since returning from Spider-Man, one of which consisted of a largely LGBTQ+ cast and crew that became another community for Barack.
Mostly, though, Barack’s return has been the calm before the storm.
“This is the least busy I’ve been in four years,” Barack said. “It’s been nice to have a break. My manager said to relish it while it’s here.”
For a talent like Barack, it likely won’t last long.

Podcasts and music are a natural, obvious pairing. They’re both audio-based mediums, providing the perfect opportunity for podcasts to augment the music listening experience by including commentary, conducting interviews with artists and putting songs in conversation with one another. 
Experiencing music in a large, crowded venue like Coachella is one way to enjoy music, but listening to a song in the context of intimate storytelling is an entirely different way that can be just as enjoyable and informative. These four podcasts take deep dives into your favorite artists, introduce you to new music you’ll enjoy and provide insight into the music industry.
All Songs Considered
Started in 2000 as NPR’s first original online-only program, “All Songs Considered” quickly became the foundation for NPR’s robust music journalism desk. The show is hosted by Bob Boilen and Robin Hilton, two veteran music critics whose affable attitudes and unwavering excitement for new and old music give the podcast the kind of good-natured charm one expects from a public radio show.
The podcast’s episodes come in a few different formats. “New Mix” episodes bring together music from different genres connected to a theme, with Hilton and Boilen’s commentary interspersed. “New Music Friday” episodes feature new songs from artists that aren’t dominating headlines when the slew of album releases come out each Friday. And “Guest DJ” episodes are part interview, part music discovery, as the hosts hand the remote over to artists so they can play songs that inspire them as Boilen and Hilton talk to the musicians about their personal lives, backgrounds and creative process.
The podcast largely centers on music discovery, as Boilen and Hilton usually feature small, independent artists who often see huge success years after “All Songs Considered” features them. Boilen and Hilton also make sure to feature music outside of their own tastes by bringing in public radio journalists from around the nation to recommend everything from heavy metal and country to Latinx pop and jazz instrumentals. 

Dissect
From Spotify, “Dissect” tracks an iconic artist through the deep exploration of one of their albums. Each episode lasers in on a single song, as host Cole Cuchna teases out the artist’s history and influences over the course of a season. 
So far, Cuchna has taken on Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp A Butterfly,” Kanye West’s “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,” Frank Ocean’s “Channel Orange” and “Blonde,” Lauryn Hill’s “The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill” and is currently dissecting Tyler, The Creator’s “Flower Boy.” 
Cuchna analyzes each lyric and musical note with the same diligence an English professor would bring to a lecture on Shakespeare. He also puts each song into the context of music history, breaking down the inspirations for the  composition and illustrating the impact these groundbreaking artists had on the music industry and artists that came after them. 
While he comes across as something of a professor in each episode, Cuchna is just as much a music superfan. His voice exudes appreciation for the music he discusses in every bit of each episode — he’s the music nerd who just can’t wait to tell everyone about the albums he’s listening to on repeat. The Kanye season is a great place to start, or follow along with the Tyler, the Creator season, which debuted just last week.

Song Exploder
A Radiotopia podcast hosted by talented singer-songwriter Thao Nguyen, “Song Exploder” sets itself apart because it allows musicians to take the wheel in each episode. While the podcast is rooted in interviews between Nguyen and an artist, in the final show, Nguyen’s role is minimal, with only the artist’s end of the interview played. 
Each week, the podcast has a musician pick apart their song, from its inception to the final product. Artists discuss the inspiration behind their songs, the instruments and melodies they used and the meaning behind their lyrics. Along with the artist’s explanations, you get to hear the melodies, instruments and lyrics talked about — stripped down demo versions, the individual instruments that you barely hear in the final version of the song, the preliminary vocals. It’s like a better, audio-forward version of Genius Lyrics. 
The podcast primarily features independent artists, offering a method of music discovery that stems from hearing the creation of a song before ever hearing the artist’s music, but has also featured popular artists like Janelle Monáe and Solange. 
But the other standout this podcast features is music that often flies under the radar — themes from TV shows like “Stranger Things” and movies like “Moonlight.” As composers break down their scores, listeners develop a new appreciation for the music in their favorite on-screen stories.

I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats
Hosted by “Welcome to Night Vale” creator Joseph Fink and housed by the Night Vale Presents network, “I Only Listen to the Mountain Goats” features conversations between the quirky Fink and the equally quirky John Darnielle — usually the solitary member of the Mountain Goats. 
Darnielle is a prolific artist — the Mountain Goats have released 16 albums since its first in 1994, and its latest, “In League with Dragons,” comes out this week. The Mountain Goats have a relatively small but unequivocally passionate cult following — while it might seem like this podcast is just for those superfans of the band, Fink and Darnielle use the podcast to discuss broader themes of music creation, artistry and the relationships between a musician and their fans. 
Darnielle is incredibly open on the podcast — he eagerly explains how he uses music to philosophize about the human condition, answers Fink’s probing questions with extensive details and is unafraid to discuss mistakes he’s made throughout his life and career.
The first season of the podcast takes on the 2002 album “All Hail West Texas,” with each episode tackling one song. The show also featured fan-made covers of each song in their respective episodes. 
Its second season debuted this month and breaks down songs from the band’s latest album, “In League with Dragons,” inspired by tabletop games like “Dungeons & Dragons.” 
CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that “All Songs Considered” started as a radio program. It was started as an online-only program. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

This past semester, I had the opportunity to interview the most amazing black entrepreneurs; I was able to travel deeper into the community of South Los Angeles and meet people striving to achieve their dreams. I interviewed my hairdresser who lives in View Park and spoke with two entrepreneurs who are about to open up the first black brewery in Inglewood. I talked to the community members who opened up the first black-owned social club in Los Angeles and ate soul food at a restaurant with a black female head chef. It’s safe to say that this semester, I became more in touch with my own culture, and the possibilities of what we can do. 
And so now, to wrap it all up, I interview my last black entrepreneur for the semester. 
I sit with her at a coffee shop in USC Village. She is nervous, with a self-proclaimed (organic light roast) coffee addiction and is about to graduate from USC with a degree in what is basically a fancy word for storytelling. After just learning how to properly connect to USC’s Wi-Fi, she says she has no idea what is going to happen after graduation. Life is unpredictable and scary, but it’s part of the journey. And, as a young writer, she is aware of the possibilities life has to offer. It is not the lack of opportunities that scares her, but the abundance of them. 
It’s me. I’m the young writer.  
“I am just going with the flow,” I said to myself in the interview. “I will [probably] go home for the summer, regroup and see what opportunities I can find in the fall.” 
The decision to go home, to work at the local newspaper while reaping the benefits of home-cooked meals and the comfort of sleeping with more than two pillows on a bed, was a personal one. 
“I just want to go home,” I said. “Working with my local newspaper will be a good training ground for me to practice investigation, reporting skills and getting closer with my own community. There are some good stories to cover back home.”
And as this year looks to be a gap year before graduate school, there are many cities to visit, many countries to travel to and many things to try, in order to find out which path is the best fit. The digital field is unstable but rapidly expanding; journalism has never been more essential to public service and the voices of those long ignored by the world have never been louder, longing for someone to hear them and tell their stories. 
“I never considered myself a journalist, but rather, someone who simply did journalism,” I said. “But as I got older, I realized journalism has many different genres within [it], and there is a need for people to cover national policies, just as there is a need for someone to cover, perhaps, the cultural erasure and gentrification happening to various communities, not only in this country but also abroad.” 
But as the world of journalism moves more into the digital sphere, there is an element of branding that must accompany it. Now, writers can find gigs on Twitter and models can make it big on Instagram. Having an aesthetically pleasing website can capture the eyes of interested publicists and meeting the supply and demand of the written word in today’s age, often cannot wait for an editor’s discretion.
“I’m trying to find ways to maximize myself as a writer, while also having a brand that can accompany that,” I said. “I want to still have internships …  I want to still do everything the traditional way, but I also want to make sure that the foundation of my writing career is rooted in the possibilities that social media has to offer. I don’t want to box myself in as just one thing. If I can do it all, then let me do it all.”
Writers from previous generations often must go back to create digital footprints for themselves after having long and fabulous careers. But there lies an opportunity for newer generations to build social presences in tandem with their careers, so that they can not only be journalists, but also sell clothes on their Instagram accounts. 
“It’s a balancing act,” I said. “And this summer I will be figuring out how to, I guess, do just that … I don’t [know] what will happen in the fall, and I’m looking at places to apply, looking at places to move to. But whatever happens, I just want to make sure that I keep going. That I keep trying to [find] footing in this rapidly changing world.”
Now, as the final weeks of college approach, there is only anxiety, fear and excitement for what is to come. There is no way to focus on what the future holds. There is only the present and the ways in which those moments must now come together and prove themselves.
So this is hardly the end for “The Black Cat.” This premise will continue as a newsletter and will also begin covering the intersection of black culture and politics. This is so that, whether an editor picks up a freelance pitch or not, the culture will be covered and the people will still have a voice.  
“Please subscribe to my newsletter,” I said.

As Interim President Wanda Austin passes the torch to President-elect Carol Folt in July, Folt will inherit a slew of scandals that have been unearthed over the last year. With this transition, the media’s spotlight will now be directed onto Folt to see whether she will fulfill promises of increased accountability and transparency and build a healthy collaboration with news media.
With its own journalism school, USC is widely seen as an institution that values the media and its role in upholding a just society. But at past events, like the “Conversations with the Dean” event held by the Gould School of Law in February, Austins’ comments reflected a concerning distrust in journalism. According to Annenberg Media, Austin reportedly said the Los Angeles Times is “just having a great time at [USC’s] expense” in reporting on these scandals and is “interested in selling newspapers, so they’re looking for the most salacious titles that they can possibly come up with.”
However, the leader of a university should be ready for scrutiny — by both its stakeholders and the press. While scrutiny is difficult and uncomfortable for anyone affiliated with USC, an administrator with the University’s best interests at heart must understand the role of news media in keeping institutions accountable. 
The purpose of journalism is not to coddle or comfort; rather, it exists to serve as a watchdog to strengthen accountability. When institutions like USC try to bury problems in hopes of them dissolving instead of addressing them and exposing the errors of our ways, people inevitably get hurt. We saw this with the scandal involving former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, in which USC ignored reports from victims about sexual assault for years. 
Yet, USC quietly reached a settlement with him and kept the scandal hidden until the Times article was released and still failed to report Tyndall to the medical board until nearly a year after he left the University. Without the Times’ reporting, the survivors’ voices may have still been suppressed by USC in an effort to keep the lid sealed on these controversies and save face.
To say that the reporters covering these scandals are having a “great time” unfairly sensationalizes rigorous, conscientious reporting. As fellow members of the Los Angeles community, the Times reporters probably take no pleasure in airing USC’s dirty laundry. It is not the reporting that sensationalizes the issues but the shocking elements of the scandals themselves that interest people. The Times, as well as other outlets across the country have simply done their job in informing the community of facts they deserve to know.
Labeling the Times’ headlines as “salacious” is a misguided critique on the nature of journalism. The role of headlines is to summarize an article and grab readers’ attention. To the extent that the headline is accurate and factual, writing it in a captivating manner is no sin — after all, a journalist’s role is to inform the community, which can only be done if their articles pique  interest and are read.
Austin is certainly  entitled to her own opinions on the Times’ reporting, but as the head of our University, her words reflect a worrying and increasingly rampant sentiment of distrust in an institution that serves to protect the vulnerable and hold those in power accountable. 
If USC’s administration is as committed to atonement and transparency as it claims to be, it must support journalism even when the truths it unveils are uncomfortable to read and tough to swallow. 
At the same Gould event, Austin said the key to good leadership involves “holding up a mirror to yourself.” When Folt assumes the USC presidency, hopefully she can support and respect the institutions holding up a mirror to USC: the media.

It was 7:13 a.m. when the news broke. 
Most of us were sleeping in — after all, spring break had just started — but we woke up to notifications of what would become known as Operation Varsity Blues, the latest and largest scandal to hit USC.
Since that day, the Daily Trojan has pulled together a series of follow-ups to the college admissions bribery scheme. Out of our 25 editors, only two news editors were on campus for spring break to report. As full-time students, we all looked forward to savoring our week-long break from academics and journalism. 
But news never stops — and neither do we.
Today marks the anniversary of #SaveStudentNewsrooms. A year ago, the Daily Campus of Southern Methodist University lost its independence after being forced into re-affiliation with the university due to financial issues. In response, student newsrooms across the nation — Daily Trojan included — stood in solidarity to stress the importance of independent student journalism.  
But one year later, the obstacles we face as student journalists — from the lack of financial support to undervaluation from the communities we serve — still persist. Editors of the Daily Bruin went on strike April 9 after the ASUCLA Communications Board voted to appoint an editor-in-chief against the staff’s recommendation. Days before, the University of Arizona forced the Daily Wildcat out of its newsroom without the staff’s input or an adequate relocation plan. Student newspapers are still walking on eggshells, unsure about where their futures stand, publishing story after story with little support from their own universities.
Here at the Daily Trojan, the past year has been challenging to say the least. We have covered breaking news, profiled notable campus figures and reported on sports games on top of editing stories and designing layouts nightly. Following a seemingly endless onslaught of revelations that USC was mired in the center of national scandals — chief among them the decades of sexual abuse at the hands of former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, the lengthy presidential search following C. L. Max Nikias’ untimely resignation and the recent college admissions bribery scheme — we found ourselves sending the finished paper to print at 2 a.m. on most nights. And the next day, we’d come back to the newsroom in Student Union 421 and do it all over again. 
But this all came at a cost: Daily Trojan is one of the last student-run college newspapers in the nation that publishes five days a week. In addition to attending lectures, studying for midterms and working part-time jobs and internships — after all, we are here as students first and foremost — our editors began to experience burnout given the 40-plus hours we spend laboring away in the newsroom every week. Holding USC accountable and sharing student voices is a full-time job, and one that we have repeatedly demonstrated that we are prepared to undertake at the cost of our own well-being. 
This year, our reporting has excelled where our University has faltered. In today’s issue alone, we published four in-depth features across three sections as well as regular updates on ongoing campus events and issues. Without the Daily Trojan, the USC community would still be in the dark about the demographics of the Board of Trustees’ Executive Committee members, about the countless culinary hidden gems nestled throughout South L.A., about insights into the volatile administrative changes that followed the 2018 football season and about how the University attempted to censor student voices by revoking its promise of transparency and banning one of our reporters from an open presidential search forum.
The Daily Trojan represents the pulse of USC. In putting a tangible product out on newsstands daily, we set the tone for the day, elucidating key administrative decisions and policy changes made behind closed doors as well as celebrating the achievements of students and faculty. Without the Daily Trojan, the USC community would not have a reliable source to turn to for all the facets of the Trojan experience — the good, the bad and the ugly. 
Now more than ever, as the University undergoes a monumental leadership transition and recovers from the fallout of innumerable scandals and lawsuits, the community needs an unbiased and trustworthy source of information as well as a watchdog to keep the administration’s actions in check. Now more than ever, as the free press is villainized daily and college newspapers across the country are unjustly stripped of their value and resources, we need to band together. We hope you will join us in the fight to #SaveStudentNewsrooms.

With just one semester remaining in my time at USC, I’ve found myself thinking about my roots and the experiences that launched me on this three-year journey of learning, activism and finding my voice. The future is an open book, and I find this all at once terrifying and exciting. But the past — these past three years, specifically — will always be my origins, my lived experiences and my home, foundational to wherever I go next. Because home, I’ve learned, is not a place; it is people, memories, feelings of love, comfort and support.
In the last three years, I’ve served as a managing editor of the Daily Trojan, published a book of essays about feminism, lobbied for domestic and global reproductive rights in Washington, D.C. and led community and external advocacy efforts for USC’s Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment. I’ve become someone I could only ever have dreamt of being before I started college, and I’m indebted to the people whose love and trust sustained me through every moment of it. Because no one achieves anything alone. 
When I was younger, a string of difficult experiences opened my mind and heart to the dangers and realities of misogyny. Early experiences with sexual assault, sexual harassment and personal health issues led me to the realization that there is so much to fight for — and so much to give back. 
For years, I’ve felt indebted to the women and people who supported me at an independent women’s health clinic. They shoulder ceaseless threats and hatred just to perform the thankless work of helping other women. Everything I’m proud of and every achievement that has made me the person I am, traces back to the generosity and support I received when I needed it most.
I take my responsibility to give back to the community of advocates and health care providers who stand with survivors seriously and offer life-giving and life-saving care to people of all backgrounds and circumstances. Their love, compassion and faith in their work have made me and unsaid numbers of young women who we are. In my writing, activism and daily choices, I strive toward promoting an environment in which they are appreciated, respected and supported, as they deserve to be.
My passion for these causes — fighting for survivors and for reproductive justice — empowers me through any adversity. And, certainly, there has been adversity. The harassment I shouldered and fought against in my adolescent years has only followed me as I’ve grown, taking different forms: in hateful comments and emails responding to my work, and in harassment and intimidation efforts by militant, anti-abortion and anti-women’s rights protesters. 
This sort of bullying and intimidation, which began when I was as young as 15, was supposed to break me. But it made me strong. Adversity, cruelty and harassment have made me and so many women stronger. No one should have to face it, and every day, we fight for a world in which someday no one will. But until such time as we reach that point — and I know, someday, we will — we are strengthened by our support for each other, in the face of so much hatred.
At the end of the day, we are in this fight — the fight of and for our lives — not because it is easy, but because it is worth it and necessary. And through these formative years of my time at USC, through every episode of unspeakable cruelty I have watched take place, around the world, the country and, yes, often on this campus, I have watched countless numbers of people stand up, fight back and give their voices to the voiceless. It’s through their everyday acts of love and sacrifice that we see the moral arc of the universe bend just a little bit closer to justice.
Writing this column for three years and speaking from my heart about the issues that matter to me as a young woman, have been one of the most distinct honors of my time at USC. I am so thankful for those of you who have followed it through the years — faculty members, classmates and especially fellow young women, who have reached out and connected with me about shared ideas and experiences. I have one more semester, and, as always, much more to say — but I feel strongly it’s time for the University to hear out the voice of a new woman on these issues. Whoever she is, I can’t wait to read her work. 
And lastly, I would be remiss to close out this three-year endeavor without thanking the people whose faith in me made it possible. From my first editor at the Daily Trojan (Lily Vaughan), to the incredible editors-in-chief I’ve worked with along the way (Danni Wang, Emma Peplow and Allen Pham), to the fellow editors who have practically become family to me (Catherine Yang, Eric He, Terry Nguyen, Tomás Mier, Jonathon Xue, Ryan Fawwaz), this newspaper connected me to some of the best people I’ve ever worked with, probably some of the best people I’ll ever know. 
As I leave this column behind, I’ll never leave behind the friendships and memories I’ve made along the way.

Nearly 25 students, faculty and staff  commemorated the victims of the Sri Lanka terrorist attacks at a vigil Wednesday that emphasized the importance of community, acceptance and peace. The terrorist attacked on Easter Sunday claimed the lives of over 350 people and injured hundreds more across churches and hotels. 
“I think that by being here we’re all stressing how this is not normal and this shouldn’t be normalized and cannot be normalized,” Interfaith Council President Shradha Jain said. “We need to reach out and support our Trojan community, our friends and family who have been affected by this tragic event in Sri Lanka.”
The event was hosted by the Office of Religious Life and included speakers from Interfaith Council and the Caruso Catholic Center. 
During the vigil, attendees formed a circle to pray for victims and offer words of love and hope for the affected communities.
“Most importantly, I think there’s a deep sense of vulnerability that our communities on campus are feeling, especially with regards to sacred spaces,” said Jain, a senior majoring in business administration. “I think at USC we can come together to express how warm our hearts are and how we can remain to create safe spaces, sacred spaces amongst each other.”
Rosie Shawver, director of Campus Ministry at the Caruso Catholic Center, recited a prayer delivered by Pope Francis on Easter.
“I wish to manifest my affectionate closeness to the Christian community [in Sri Lanka, which was] hit while they were gathered in prayer,’” Shawver recited. “‘And to the victims of such cruel violence, I entrust to the Lord all those who have tragically died, and I pray for the injured who are suffering because of this traumatic event.”
The prayer also called for peace and acceptance of all people, regardless of religious, political or ideological differences.
Led by the Rev. Jim Burklo, senior associate dean of Religious Life, attendees sang Interfaith chants. Burklo said gathering as a community helps facilitate togetherness and understanding.
“This circle represents the world that I think every one of us wants,” he said. “A world where people of different faiths or of no faith tradition at all respect each other, are interested in each other, are curious about each others’ traditions.”
Noha Ayoub, a senior majoring in law, history and culture, said she felt it was important to gather after a tragedy to express solidarity.
“I think it’s important for us, as human beings, to come together to mourn those that have passed because otherwise what’s our purpose here in life if we’re not here to be together?” Ayoub said. 
Attendees were prompted to write letters offering solidarity and prayer to the victims of the attack.
“I hope that in time, [the families of the victims, the friends, the neighbors and the people reading the news] find peace and happiness,” read one of the anonymous prayers.
The letters, compiled with other prayers from the USC’s Little Chapel of Silence, were then ceremonially burned in the biannual prayer celebration hosted by the Interfaith Council.
The Caruso Catholic Center will host an evening mass on Sunday to memorialize the victims and offer prayers to their families.

Growing up in Kentucky, Kayla Soren realized there were serious coal energy issues affecting different communities in her region. Now, the USC junior will continue her pursuit of climate change activism with a $30,000 scholarship from the Harry S. Truman Foundation.
“In Kentucky, there’s a huge energy issue with coal mining hurting our communities and the environment and our economy and the situation just keeps getting worse,” Soren said. “So growing up in that state, it was really easy to see the impact of environmental destruction and poor policy planning and the importance of renewable energy.”
Soren, who is majoring in environmental studies and international relations, received the award for her work in climate change activism, including co-founding the International Student Environmental Coalition. Soren and seven others founded ISEC three years ago to create a network of countries that provide climate justice resources for students around the world.
Soren said her participation in the Kentucky Student Environmental Coalition launched deep involvement in grassroots activism, which includes co-founding ISEC, participating in bipartisan climate research through a Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences program in D.C., interning at the Barefoot College in Guatemala, a non-profit organization that trains women to be innovators and educators in their local communities.
“[KSEC] basically bring high schools and universities across Kentucky to make grassroots movements,” Soren said. “And it was really empowering to me and inspiring, and it made me feel like I could actually make a change for the environment.”
From there, Soren said she leveraged her involvement in the Ben Franklin Transatlantic Fellows Institute, a program that brings together students from the United States and European countries to brainstorm solutions to environmental issues, to create ISEC.
“I realized that, although there was an environmental movement in the United States, there wasn’t one really in the other countries at all in terms of Europe,” Soren said. “All of these countries from around the world were reaching out to [KSEC], wanting to get involved, and we realized this was really a way to get the entire global movement together. It really took off, and now we’re in 30 countries and it’s amazing.”
According to Soren, the goal of ISEC is to help provide the tools that activists around the world could use to create their own leadership within their own communities.
“The best people that know solutions to their communities are those living in the communities,” Soren said. “And so…what the network does is it helps anyone implement whatever they want for their community”
Andy Liang, assistant director of the Office of Academic Honors and Fellowships, has worked with Soren since her freshman year and said her achievements make her the perfect Truman Scholar.
“What Truman is looking for is change agents, the movers and shakers, and people who are really going to make a dent in shaping the policies and the ways in which we are solving the critical world issues of tomorrow,” Liang said. “They’re looking for public servants and people who are addressing problems from the ground up and working with local communities and I think Kayla’s done a really exceptional job of doing just that.”
Najmedin Meshkati, a professor of engineering and international relations, has also worked with Soren in his Technology and Environment freshman seminar, and said he has high confidence in her future.
“It has been an absolute privilege to work with Kayla, to have her as a student, and to write letters of rec and nominations — all of them were successful,” Meshkati said. “I would not be surprised that in several years from now we see Kayla as a Nobel Peace Prize winner. She has all the caliber and all the passion.”
Next, Soren will attend Truman Scholar Leadership Week at the end of May. During the week, she will participate in local community service projects and attend sessions about preparing for graduate school and creating group policy projects, in addition to a multitude of other information sessions and fairs.
“I’m excited for that and I plan on grad school a few years after I graduate,” Soren said. “I want to take a gap year and know exactly what program would be best fit for me.”
