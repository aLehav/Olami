Following a year where USC went on a historical unbeaten run during the regular season, women’s soccer Head Coach Keidane McAlpine will become the new head coach at Georgia after leading the Trojans for eight seasons, according to a media release Tuesday. 
“We are so grateful for Keidane’s service and commitment to our student-athletes, athletics program, and the University over the past eight years,” Athletic Director Mike Bohn said in a statement. “Keidane is the model coach, and he will be missed.”
McAlpine immediately changed the course of women’s soccer upon his introduction as head coach by bringing USC back to the postseason after failing to clinch the playoffs in 2013. After finishing the 2013 season with an 8-10-2 record, McAlpine swifty led women’s soccer to a 12-6-3 record and back into the postseason in his first season. 
McAlpine steered USC to eight consecutive playoff appearances, and never failed to qualify for the postseason. 
McAlpine led USC to a national championship in 2016 after beating West Virginia in the final. During the 2016 title-winning season, McAlpine’s team achieved 10 consecutive victories as well as seven consecutive shutouts during the championship run. 
The reigning Pac-12 Coach of the Year led USC to a program record 15-game unbeaten run and 11 consecutive victories during the 2021 regular season. After matching the program’s best Pac-12 record at 8-1-2, McAlpine led the Trojans to a second-place finish in the Pac-12 and the second round of the postseason. 
He leaves the program with a strong foundation in place after introducing multiple first-year players into the fold this season. Four freshman players received All-Freshman Honors. The second-winningest coach in program history coached USC’s all-time leading goalscorer, senior forward Penelope Hocking to breaking the record. 
McAlpine won 116 games during his tenure as head coach and leaves behind eight postseason runs and a national championship.

Over Thanksgiving break, I headed with my family over to Soho in New York City, where I indulged myself with food, high school friends, late-night work and shopping. While my shopping cart consisted of Black Friday deals and puffer jackets to soothe my inner East Coast soul, my strangest purchase was a birthday gift for my sister and me: matching zapped bracelets from CatBird’s welding annex. 
For those who don’t know what zapped bracelets are, they are bracelets with the clasp welded shut so that you can’t take them off. While this was a bit of an expensive gift — with prices ranging from $98 to $334 per bracelet — part of the bracelet’s charm wasn’t the fact that it was a special bonding gift between my sister and me, but, especially because we had lived in different countries and opposite coasts for the past five years, we love taking any chance to be closer together in little ways. 
But this weird experience with jewelry made me think about another concept I have been grappling with: marriage. I understand what marriage is —the fact that it’s not for everyone, and that it’s a legal bond — but the concept has always felt foreign. If the relationship with your partner still exists in the same deeply caring and loving state without the legal aspect, why get the government involved in the relationship? 
Is it to prove some sort of love? To finesse some gifts from a registry? Or just to take one step above all others; a superior level of love to show to the world that you care about someone so much you are legally bound to them?
I want to be clear that I don’t hate the idea of marriage. I, too, have shamefully already picked out my dream engagement and wedding ring — intricate hands holding the gems created by Anthony Lent. I fantasize about the guy who would make life just a little easier and everyone fawning over me as I stride down the aisle (I still sweat at the thought of my first dance, but we’ll cross that bridge when we get there.) 
But, in all honesty, I feel that marriage has become this big, scary shadow to some because of the way society has framed it. People have already gawked at my bracelet, asking me why I wanted a permanent one — but how come they don’t react the same to marriage? Even last Saturday at Friendsgiving, we discussed who from our high school class we would marry, but the question was framed more like: 
“Ok, if you had to marry someone from our class, who would it be? And remember I said marry. Like marry.”
I believe a lot of this strange stigma and intense pressure has to do with the history of marriage, and its varying cultural significance to different communities. 
For example, wedding traditions in the United States are different from those in Japan, just as Japan’s are different from those in India. At the same time, marriage is an exclusive luxury; not everyone can get married where they are, and many people can’t marry the people they want to be with. Of course, with this idea of legal obligation and infinity that comes with traditional interpretations of marriage, it is no wonder that people have begun to shy away from it. 
And don’t even get me started on marriages that don’t run their full course. To this day, I don’t understand why it is a shameful thing to be divorced or to be a single parent, especially if you aren’t the cause of the marriage’s demise. When people get a parking ticket for breaking the law, it’s no big deal. But when people consensually decide to split their legal marriage, it’s suddenly hush-hush and a topic to avoid. 
So, by extension, wouldn’t a ring essentially be a self-welded bracelet? Not a trap to chain to someone or something but an action of choice?
I believe that my ideas of marriage will obviously change over time. I have yet to experience being in love and, currently, in my era of utterly loving myself, have found great comfort and happiness in following “Glee’s” very own Sue Sylvester’s path of marrying herself. 
But until I come to a better conclusion that stems from a place other than an 18-year-old brain, I’ll live peacefully with my friends, my family and my zapped bracelet. 
Happy holidays.
Stay safe out there.

Well folks, as the semester’s end approaches, finals are imminent. I am by no means an expert, but I am a practiced procrastinator, which is why I want to pass along the trace amounts of wisdom that I’ve learned in regard to a successful finals season. 
Stage one: The calm before the storm
The week before Thanksgiving is always peaceful and quiet. I bet you are thinking, “I’ve got this covered! I’ll make a schedule and I’ll really stick to it.” 
This is false, and you are naive. 
In order to start preparing for what will inevitably be your undoing, I recommend listening to some confusingly upbeat tunes. 
For this stage, I recommend a Spotify playlist called False Joy. All the songs on it sound happy, but when you really listen, they are actually incredibly sad. Your body will process the joy of Mitski’s “Washing Machine Heart,” but your brain will begin to process the future pain. 
Stage two: PANIC!
AHHHH! You didn’t budget your time well and now it’s time to panic about your impending doom. My advice is to try and lock yourself in a safe environment, such as the Annenberg Digital Lounge. 
Treat yourself to an Illy Cafe waffle and an overpriced latte. Plug in your headphones and blast thoughts out of your head with some classic movie scores. I find that listening to movie scores is motivating but doesn’t distract me with lyrics. My go-to plug in song is “The Secret Life of Daydreams” from the Jean-Yves Thibaudet 2005 film “Pride and Prejudice” soundtrack. Luckily, Spotify is loaded with playlists of scores to match whatever mood you’re feeling besides panic. 
Stage three: Overcomplication nation 
So now you’ve addressed the root of the problem. Finals are coming, and it’s study days. The future is bright. You can see the light at the end of the tunnel. It feels so close that you start to fill up your days. Maybe you think that if you spend four hours at Doheny Memorial Library on this project, you can finish it quickly and then the next four hours you’ll spend studying for your oral Spanish exam. 
Do not overcomplicate things. I find that everytime I make a hyperdetailed schedule, I just end up disappointing myself when I don’t finish everything. Productivity does not determine your self worth. If you truly do not have it in you to study then take a break. Do a face mask, clean your whole room and light a candle. Prioritize your mental well being and listen to some ABBA, Earth, Wind & Fire or Marvin Gaye. 
Stage four: Screaming, crying and throwing up
I know I said prioritize self-care, and that is the main priority, but with $70,000 tuition, you may also feel the need to perform well in your classes. I know I do. So now it’s time to scream, cry and throw up in the place where dreams go to die: Leavey Library.
My methodology with doing work in Leavey is simple — it is so miserable that you’re going to do anything to get out. If writing your 10-page paper or studying for your Organic Chemistry exam is your task of the day, then Leavey will suck it out of you.
Take a deep breath and listen to these songs in this order. First “Cellophane” by FKA Twigs, next “Class of 2013” by Mitski and lastly “brutal” by Olivia Rodrigo. Remind yourself that first and foremost you are a girlboss who is going to succeed regardless of what is thrown your way. 
Stage five: Relief
The moment is here. You’ve either just hit submit on your final project or made a graceful and classy exit from your last exam. You exit whatever brick building you were in and take a deep breath. You’re free. 
I can’t lie, I cry at the end of almost every semester from pure relief. Now it’s time to celebrate. Do something you’ve always wanted to do but are too afraid to try. Buy yourself a cupcake from the Sprinkles vending machine or splurge on a matcha latte from Dulce. The soundtrack to your life at this moment should be something deliriously happy such as “Deceptacon” from Le Tigre, “The Spins” by Mac Miller or “Be Sweet” by Japanese Breakfast.
Pat yourself on the back for finishing your first, 100th or last USC finals season. Hopefully these songs and tips can help you fight on through finals with minimal stress.

An ordinance requiring all food and beverage-serving facilities to provide disposable utensils, napkins and other foodware only upon request went into effect in the City of Los Angeles Nov. 15. The new law, part of the city’s sustainability efforts to reduce plastic waste, applies to both dine-in and take-out facilities — including all USC residential dining halls, the quick service restaurants at Ronald Tutor Campus Center and all other campus food venues. 
The ordinance follows the city’s Straws-on-Request ordinance, a law requiring straws only to be given if restaurant customers ask for them, which took effect in October 2019. Ahead of the citywide move, USC Hospitality banned the use of straws in dining halls in 2018. USC Hospitality, at the time of publication, has eliminated 95% of disposable foodware items, such as sugar packets and condiments, that it provided in the past.
In an informational presentation to businesses about the details of the new ordinance on Nov. 8, L.A. Sanitation & Environment described the environmental impacts of plastic waste, explaining that plastics are non-compostable. The presentation cited the increased dependence on takeout and food delivery over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, which caused a surge in the amount of disposable foodware accessories used worldwide by approximately 250 to 300%. 
While complaint-based enforcement does not begin until May 15, businesses and food-serving facilities across the city have already begun enforcing the new law, including dining halls and restaurants on campus. 
“USC Hospitality is aware of the ordinance and has made changes to its operations to ensure compliance,” wrote Dirk De Jong, assistant vice president of USC Auxiliary Services, in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We are taking our sustainability efforts a step further by providing compostable disposables upon request.”
Erikk Gonzalez, an employee at Seeds Marketplace said that, since the new law went into effect, he has seen a positive change in his work environment. Gonzalez, who has worked at Seeds for about a month, also said customers have become more mindful of the amount of utensils they use. 
“[Seeds is] cleaner … People are more organized,” Gonzalez said. “You save more. [Some people used to] take four forks and throw away two.”
Kathy Thach, a freshman majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said she hasn’t seen a change in her plastic use since the new ordinance was implemented. 
“I don’t really see a difference in general on a large scale,” Thach said. “In terms of this new L.A. ordinance … trying to solve the problem of plastic pollution, I think it’s just another tactic to blame individual people with the facade of being eco-friendly.”
Thach said that, when it comes to the conversation about pollution as a whole, more focus is placed on the impact of individual consumption rather than that of corporations.
“This is just another one of those conversations that surrounds plastic, and I feel like nothing ever really changes,” Thach said. 
Reducing the use of disposable plastics is a key component of USC’s sustainability goals, wrote Chief Sustainability Officer Mick Dalrymple in an email to the Daily Trojan. 
“Eliminating non-essential, single-use plastics is one of USC’s initiatives to achieve our zero waste goals,” Dalrymple wrote.
Dalrymple, USC’s first chief sustainability officer, heads the Office of Sustainability and currently assists administration in developing the Sustainability 2028 Plan. The plan, which is expected to be published next spring, will outline USC’s long-term sustainability initiatives, including the administration’s consideration of a University-wide ban on single-use plastics. 
Dalrymple wrote that he sees the ordinance as a “next step” that “makes sense” in the context of the University’s greater sustainability goals.
“Nature doesn’t understand the terms ‘waste’ or ‘disposable,’ because all resources are reused in nature,” Dalrymple wrote. “Hopefully, one day people will no longer remember those terms and will look back, astonished at how many valuable resources were squandered.”

Resident assistants will indefinitely strike beginning Friday at 6 p.m. after launching a petition demanding increased compensation, improvements in their financial aid packages and the creation of a Resident Assistant Advisory Board Nov. 17.
“Fix our financial aid! We will not work for free,” the RA Organizing Committee wrote in an Instagram post Sunday.
In the petition and in interviews with the Daily Trojan, RAs said their financial aid packages were lower than in previous years, causing some RAs to lose money despite working long hours. Other RAs reported registration holds because of late fees they accrued due to higher tuition costs they were unable to pay. 
The strike is an option that some RAs have been “compiling and playing with for a while” said Makayla Howard, a junior majoring in fine arts and an RA at Pardee Tower. After receiving communication from Residential Education that said nothing else could be done, Howard said “there was no other option.”
Sofija Radulovic, a senior majoring in civil engineering and an RA at Webb Tower, said while the petition received attention, nothing had changed — leading to their decision to strike. Radulovic said there has not been further communication with ResEd since the RA Organizing Committee launched its petition.
“Our Instagram posts got a lot of attention, but we haven’t received any kind of thing from ResEd, like any kind of discussion from ResEd,” Radulovic said. “Nothing has changed, basically, with the exception of more attention being brought to it.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University wrote that, based on a review of its practices, it needed to “change the way it determined eligibility for need-based financial aid and the treatment of the room and board provided to RAs.” 
Students lose eligibility for certain sources of need-based aid if “gift aid provided exceeds a student’s demonstrated need,” the University wrote, and the financial aid office will continue to work with students who have issues with aid.
However, Howard, Radulovic and ​​Felanté Charlemagne, a senior majoring in sociology and an RA at Webb Tower who has a hold on their registration because of overdue fees, said conversations with financial aid — which ResEd director Grant Burlew recommended to RAs in a Nov. 11 letter responding to their concerns — have not led to changes in their financial aid packages. 
In their meeting with financial aid, Charlemagne said the officer cited various reasons they received a lower financial aid package, including health insurance, parking costs and stipends for research fellowships, they started after the semester began. After refuting financial aid’s explanations for the lower aid, they said, the officer cited leadership opportunities that come with the RA position.
“Leadership skills are not paying my tuition, or getting me registered for classes next semester,” Charlemagne said. 
Out of 212 RAs, 16 initially had collection holds and 4 currently have them, according to the University. 
After releasing the petition, RAs researched similar actions at other private universities, including Stanford and Pepperdine, and reached out to RAs at those schools to ask about insight they’ve gained by navigating similar issues. 
“We’ve done a lot of research on what other schools and institutions are doing about these issues, because there are other schools with RAs that have petitioned, and we’ve decided that this is the one way that we can really let ResEd know that we’re serious about this,” Howard said.
RAs went on strike at Stanford to protest coronavirus regulations and called for increased compensation, particularly for work during orientation and training periods. The strike ended without resolution, with RAs returning because of concerns for their residents, according to CalMatters. 
Howard said RAs have discussed communicating with residents about the upcoming strike and ensuring they are aware of emergency numbers and protocols. 
“[Residents] can also speak for us, and they act on our behalf,” Howard said. “Really making this a community thing, is another hope. That this is not just RAs against ResEd, but this is not such a local issue as it is a really greater issue within the USC community.”
There is currently no timetable for the strike and RAs who have spoken with the Daily Trojan said they are willing to strike until their demands are met and an agreement is reached.
“I’m hoping [Residential Education] resolves our issues. I hope they fix our financial aid packages, or give us a stipend — whatever is needed to remedy the problem,” Charlemagne said. “They weren’t really taking us seriously or didn’t really care. They kind of just brushed this off, so I’m like ‘You can’t brush this off.’” and can we double check the audio to see what the bracket for the last they is for?
Clarification: This article was updated to specify that Felanté Charlemagne referred to Residential Education in the final quote.

Both teams have had exceptional starts to their seasons. The Suns have won their last 16 games after starting the season with a 1-3 record. Golden State has lost only two games by a combined score of just 7 points.
The first quarter of the NBA season saw the Suns and Warriors dominate the standings. Golden State leads at 18-2, just a game ahead of Phoenix at 17-3. While the two are in the bottom 10 in strength of schedule according to their RPI ranking, they have shown one of the most important traits a team can have: consistency. The two teams have been beating inferior opponents and fighting to win each game. 
Let’s start with Golden State. There is no doubt that Stephen Curry is the primary reason for the Warriors’ success this season. Predictably, Curry has been automatic from behind the 3-point line, shooting 42.3% from three. Curry averages 28.6 points per game, second only to Brooklyn’s Kevin Durant. So far, Curry is the unquestionable MVP of the league.
The looming return of another lethal shooter should have the league worried about how high the Warriors’ ceiling could be. Klay Thompson suffered multiple season-ending injuries in the last two years, tearing his left ACL in the 2019 NBA Finals and his right Achilles in November 2020. It has now been two full seasons since the five-time NBA All-Star has stepped on the court.
Thompson was recently assigned to the Warriors’ G-League affiliate in Santa Cruz, Calif., where he will continue to get in shape for his return to the NBA. Considering that the Warriors are already exceeding expectations, Thompson’s reintroduction could be a nightmare for the rest of the NBA.
The last time both Thompson and Curry played a season together, both stars averaged 21.5 and 27.3 points-per-game, respectively. Curry and Thompson were a lethal duo when healthy. Soon enough, they could be back in action. 
Another Warriors veteran has been a big reason for their early success. Draymond Green, who claimed to be the best defensive player of all time back in March, is continuing to make his case this season. His hustle and defensive IQ have put him in the conversation for the league’s Defensive Player of the Year award. The Warriors allow a league-best 100.9 points per game. 
Meanwhile, Phoenix has been spreading the ball around, with six players averaging double digits in scoring. Led by Devin Booker, who is scoring 23.9 points per game and shooting 41% from three, the Suns are a game away from tying the franchise’s longest win-streak of 17 games. 
The Suns’ most recent road trip yielded victories over San Antonio, Cleveland and both New York teams. Booker’s 30 points helped stave off the Nets’ 4th quarter comeback in Brooklyn Saturday.
Booker and Chris Paul’s partnership has worked well thus far. Paul’s pass-first mentality brings out the best in the Suns’ young stars. Paul is ranked first in assists per game with 10.1. 
A former Warrior is quietly contributing to the Suns’ success. Center JaVale McGee is having one of his best seasons of his 13-year career. Averaging over 10 points and 7 rebounds while only playing 16 minutes per game, McGee is one of the most efficient players in the game. His player efficiency rating ranks in the top-12 this season, an unlikely feat for a role player. 
The matchup between the Suns and Warriors could be the best games of the season so far. The Warriors will look to stifle Booker and Paul but could struggle defending Suns center Deandre Ayton, who is one of Paul’s favorite targets. The Suns will face their toughest opponent yet after a week on the road, and fatigue could play a factor. They will have to rely on their depth to overcome the Warriors’ fast pace of play. 
Curry said it himself in a postgame press conference following his game against the Los Angeles Clippers: This game is a test. Buckle up for a high-scoring battle between two teams at the top of their game.

Before the Paycom Wooden Legacy tournament’s championship game tip off, chants for San Diego State blared throughout the Anaheim Convention Center. 
Although USC handled its first opponent in the tournament, St. Josephs, the night before, a rowdy crowd and a trophy on the line provided a different challenge for the Trojans. USC outlasted the Aztecs in a hard-fought battle, winning 58-43 Friday night in Anaheim. 
“It was a great win for us against a very good basketball team,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield in a postgame press conference. “San Diego State has an outstanding program. To beat an outstanding team from an outstanding program is a big win for us. I thought our defense was great and we played very hard. We packed our toughness on a bus down here to Anaheim, we didn’t pack our free throw shooting, but we’ll take a big win here.”
On the first play of the game, senior forward Drew Peterson committed an offensive foul to turn the ball over. The stadium exploded in taunts and sneers, but it would be silent by the end of the night. 
From there, a mix of physical play from San Diego State and sloppy mistakes from USC led to the Aztecs jumping out to a 13-7 lead with around 10 minutes  left in the first half. Both teams shot poorly in the first half, combining for 37 points.
After an Enfield timeout, USC took its first lead of the game at 14-13 with 8 minutes 17 seconds left in the first half. 
“We knew we could defend them,” Enfield said. “But we knew it would probably be a low scoring game. If we had made some free throws and a couple of open shots, it might have been a little different, but give them credit because we had to earn everything we got tonight.” 
The rest of the first half was a battle, with both teams getting into the bonus — USC shot 33% from the field and SDSU shot 23%. The tournament’s most valuable player, junior forward Isaiah Mobley, seemed to be the only Trojan hitting shots, scoring 10 of the team’s 22 points at halftime. The Trojans were up 22-15 at the half. 
Mobley finished with 18 points, 12 rebounds and 2 blocks. 
“I just play based off of the flow of the game,” said Mobley in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Tonight, I feel like they had a couple of smaller defenders on me so I knew I could get it down low. My teammates also believed in me, and coach as well, just to put me in those positions to score.” 
After halftime, it was all USC and Peterson. The senior forward came out hot, controlling the offense and helping the Trojans start the half on an 8-0 run, scoring 6 of those and assisting on the other 2. 
He finished with 16 points and waved to the crowd after hitting a late three. 
“I hadn’t been shooting too well these past few games, then I got a little confidence, which was huge,” Peterson said. “Then, I knocked down my first three pointer of the season, which I had been waiting for. My teammates trust me, and I’m so thankful for that. We have such an unselfish team and it really shows against such a good defensive team.” 
Although USC’s leading scorer, junior guard Boogie Ellis, had an off night — scoring only 2 points on 1-6 shooting — Mobley, redshirt senior forward Chevez Goodwin and Peterson picked up the slack and all scored in double figures. Junior guard Ethan Anderson added 8 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists.
Mobley picked up his first double-double of the season on his way to winning tournament MVP. 
“I’m grateful to get my first double-double of the season,” Mobley said. “Hopefully, I keep that as a trend, but I’m not pressed, I just hope I keep helping our team win.”
The Trojans will play Utah at Galen Center Dec. 1 for the beginning of Pac-12 play.

Among the ash and smoke of USC student burnout wafts another familiar scent, one that has haunted students, workers, writers, homemakers and everyone in between for centuries. The Romans called it procrastinat, “deferred until morning,” which has a sort of poetic legal ring to it.
It refers, of course, to procrastination: the sordid sensation responsible for all-nighters and last-minute deadline extensions every year around this time.
While generations prior might have found it markedly more difficult to find semi-interesting tasks to busy their wandering minds, these days it takes little more than a glance at our pocket clocks. One minute we are reading an email and — oh look, a Boomerang of a puppy licking a hula hoop — suddenly three hours have whizzed by, and we are no further along than when we started.
It is not an uncommon occurrence: Between 15-20% of adults are chronically affected by procrastination, with further studies suggesting between 80-95% of college students “engage in procrastination to some degree.” 
So, what exactly is procrastination, and what’s its origin story, so to speak?
Despite uneducated guesses penned thoughtlessly by bad armchair experts, procrastination is not a result of poor time management nor another word for inherent laziness. It is a symptom of an inability to regulate emotion.
Drs. Timothy Pychyl and Fuschia Sirois conducted a study on procrastination and short-term mood regulation in 2013. They wrote, “[If] we have a great deal of self-discipline … we may exert the self-control necessary to engage in the task in a timely manner … [despite] the negative mood that the task elicits … Procrastination is the self-regulatory failure of not exerting the self-control necessary for task engagement.”
When faced with an unpleasant task, we experience unpleasant feelings. They can range from “Ew, dirty dishes are gross” to deeper feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt and anxiety.
As a result, we become more concerned with the immediate threats — these terrible feelings within — and less concerned with our longer term goals, such as academic success and personal fulfillment.
Now that we know what wakes the procrastination dragon, how can we slay it?
Firstly and perhaps most importantly, it is absolutely vital that every procrastinator cultivate a modicum of self-compassion.
This is not hippy-dippy advice born out of blissful naivety. It is hard science.
Pychyl and Sirois posited, “[Research] on ego-depletion has also shown that with rest or particular types of intervention, such as positive mood induction or self-affirmation, self-regulatory capacity and thus the ability to regulate mood in an adaptive manner is restored.” 
Many procrastinators get lost in the woods of self-critique. Realizing that not every attempt will be met with thunderous applause and shiny awards, and becoming proud of our efforts in spite of that, is a great place to start.
Next on the docket: moving indulgences farther away, literally. If the fresh pot of gingerbread coffee on the countertop is too tempting, take the work elsewhere. Being someplace unfamiliar, where old vices are impossible to reach, makes it all the easier to zone into time-sensitive tasks.
Lastly, consider working alongside someone. Personal trainers have created whole empires around the idea that it is much harder to back out of a workout session when someone else is already at the gym waiting for us to arrive.
Mental work can be just as exhausting as physical work. Make it easier to show up and get started by inviting a buddy along whenever possible.
It is mid-November. The semester’s end is within reach; then, we will be free to frolic through snow or spend hours watching puppy-hula hoop Boomerangs. Let’s just finish up whatever remains and call it a night.

Last semester, USC opened its applications for incoming exchange students from international universities via the Annenberg International Program and Marshall International Exchange Program. However, following international schools canceling their exchange programs because of their countries’ uncertain coronavirus situations, few students were able to participate in the programs. Although the pandemic has somewhat subsided in the United States, many students still decline its outgoing exchange offer because of the 14 — even 21 in some cases — days of required hotel quarantine upon arrival.
I am one of the students who was able to come to USC through the Annenberg International Program. After none of my classmates came to USC in Spring 2021, I was supposed to come with three of my classmates this semester. However, all of my classmates ultimately declined, leaving me as my university’s sole participant. 
Fortunately, the U.S. reopened its borders to fully vaccinated visitors last month, ending its restrictions imposed since March 2020. More and more countries, such as Canada and Australia, are also following these policies. That being said, many USC students may start their exchange journey in the coming semester as more and more international borders open. 
Before the pandemic, students would usually ask previous exchange students for information on the dos and don’ts, but the coronavirus pandemic created a gap between outgoing and prospective exchange students. 
Although governments provide information on coronavirus guidelines, this knowledge and unspoken rules are still limited to exchange students. It can be confusing to keep track of countries with mandatory mask policies, such as South Korea and Vietnam. Although mandatory mask laws are easy to notice and follow, government websites, such as Canada and Australia, do not rapidly update information on these changes for visitors and tourists. 
Gigi Yue, an international student from Hong Kong and a senior majoring in theatre with an emphasis in design, spoke about how people in Hong Kong behave under the pandemic. 
“Even though there are just a few daily local cases in Hong Kong and over 65% vaccination rate, citizens are still so frightened about the pandemic as the SARS left a shadow on the city in 2003,” Yue said. “Even after a decade, people become anxious whenever there is a pandemic.” 
Yue also said unspoken norms and social cues have come about because of the pandemic. 
“If you do not wear your mask outdoors or the mask does not cover your nose properly, people will probably stare at you or even scold at you,” Yue said. “When you are eating in the restaurant, it is inappropriate to just put your mask on the table without covering. Instead, people use a mask case when handling masks.”
Exchange programs are managed by the respective USC school instead of a centralized group. With the exception of co-degree programs with large groups of students, most outgoing exchange students struggle to find resources and contacts, as few students travel within the program. 
Although the USC Office of International Service provides a comprehensive guideline and orientation to incoming international and exchange students, it disregards outgoing exchange students. I was supplied resources and a 30-page booklet when I settled into USC, but this is simply not enough. 
The Office of International Services may consider holding a panel between this semester’s returning exchange students and next semester’s outgoing exchange students to provide the most up-to-date information for exchange students. The office could even establish a Facebook group for students to communicate. 
In addition to these efforts, the office can virtually gather outgoing exchange students. For instance, gatherings could connect students visiting the same country via the Annenberg International Program and Marshall International Program to provide more peer and mental support when experiencing cultural shock. 
When students travel to countries without proper public transportation, the group could act as an important tool for connecting students to share rides. For instance, the exchange student department in the National University of Singapore sends out an official private Facebook group link to every exchange student two months prior to the start of the program. 
USC can lend a helping hand through these simple steps. The Office of International Services should take the initiative to implement these efforts, which could turn into long-term support after the pandemic.
