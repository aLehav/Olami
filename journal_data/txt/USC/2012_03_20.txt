Undergraduate Student Government senators unanimously approved two resolutions advocating for the renovation of Leavey Library and the installation of a gender-neutral bathroom in the Student Union on Tuesday.
USG uses resolutions to communicate the collective opinion of the student body to the administration.
Passed · The USG Senate passed a resolution for renovations to Leavey Library and a gender-neutral bathroom in the Student Union on Tuesday. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The passage of the gender-neutral bathroom resolution coincides with a key step toward the creation of a gender-neutral housing pilot program on the Rainbow Floor, a special interest housing option for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students and allies in Century Apartments. USG senators signed off on a resolution before spring break advocating for the pilot program.
[Correction: A previous version indicated that the USC Board of Trustees approved the gender-inclusive housing pilot program. It was not approved by the Board of Trustees but rather campus administration. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
While Josh DeMilta, USG director of diversity affairs, said the step is important, he said it does not guarantee that there will be a gender-neutral housing option next year.
“This accomplishment was a huge hurdle, but there is still some work to be done [before] it’s a done deal,” DeMilta said.
The gender-neutral bathroom resolution proposes redesignating an existing bathroom in the Student Union to a gender-neutral bathroom because of its proximity to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Resource Center.
Of 294 respondents to a USG survey, 85 percent of students said they support making a single-occupancy bathroom in the Student Union gender-neutral, according to the resolution.
“We want all students at USC to feel comfortable, welcome and have their basic needs addressed,” USG President Monish Tyagi said.
The Leavey Library renovation is in the study stage and no fixed timeline has been set for the project, said Hugh McHarg, executive director of communications and public programming for USC Libraries.
“There is tremendous enthusiasm and support for making Leavey … to be a center for student intellectual life on campus,” McHarg said.
Greek Sen. Andres Guarnizo-Ospina, who authored the resolution, said he hopes the resolution will expedite the resolution process.
“The idea is that by supporting this renovation, the administration will go quicker and students will be better off when the resolution is done,” he said.
Guarnizo-Ospina said students expressed needs for improvements ranging from updating the furniture to providing more space.
Arye Lavin, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, said he believes the facility needs aesthetic improvements.
“The walls need to be repainted,” said Lavin, who studies in the library regularly.
“The color temperature in Leavey is not conducive to proper studying.”
During Tuesday’s Senate meeting, the Senate also introduced a resolution fully supporting USC’s specific plan to renovate the University Village.
The resolution will be voted on next week, the last official Senate meeting before USG officers for the 2012-2013 school year are sworn in on April 3.
I heard they were going to force God fearing Christians from Orange County to live on the Rainbow floor to teach them a lesson.
To clarify about the gender inclusive housing please read statement below:
The proposal for a gender-inclusive housing pilot on the Rainbow Floor has been reviewed and approved by the University of Southern California.  After consulting with university senior leadership and Housing and Auxiliary Services, Vice President for Students Affairs Michael Jackson approved the pilot program on the Rainbow Floor effective fall 2012.  This program is only available for upperclass students who choose to live on the Rainbow Floor, a special interest residential community for LGBT students and their supportive Allies, in Century Apartments.  The LGBT Resource Center and Office for Residential Education will coordinate the implementation of this program and evaluate its overall effectiveness.  
For additional information about this new gender inclusive living on the Rainbow Floor, please contact Vincent Vigil, Director for the LGBT Resource Center, at vincenev@usc.edu or (213) 740-7619.
I don’t know what all of the fuss is about. It sounds like a 1 bathroom with a male and female sign on the door.
A gender neutral bathroom is a *single occupancy* restroom, not a multi-stall bathroom open to anyone who wants to wander in. Good lord. Use your brain for once before you speak.
Gender-neurtral bathroom? So does that mean my “little guy” down there will be even more nervous as I urinate while females are present? He hides when it’s cold, and he’s little when he’s shy. Geez! Give me…or him, a break!

More than three-quarters of young adults ages 25 to 34 who have moved back home after college said they were satisfied with their living situations, according to a study by the Pew Research Center released earlier this month.
The trend of young adults living at home has become a widespread trend since the Great Recession, the study reported. Sixty-one percent said they have friends or family members who have moved back in with their parents over the past few years.
The study also reported that young adults living at home are optimistic about their financial futures. Seventy-seven percent said they either have enough money now to lead the life they desire or expect they will have enough money to do so in the future.
John Strauss, a professor of economics, said one reason for an increase in the number of students living at home might be high housing prices.
“A big factor in [a student’s decision to move back home after college] is housing prices,” Strauss said. “If housing prices are high, especially if they are going up, that could be one reason why [students] are going home.”
Nearly half of young adults living at home said they have contributed rent money to their parents and almost 90 percent said they have helped with household expenses.
Though the study suggests young adults living at home might be satisfied with their situations, eight in 10 young adults said they do not currently have enough money to lead the life they want, compared to 11 in 20 young adults of the same age who are not living at home.
Lauren Rowe, a senior majoring in kinesiology, said she will try to find her own place to live after graduation.
“I’m moving to Chicago to do Teach for America, but if I didn’t have that job, I probably would’ve tried to find my own place to live,” Rowe said.
Christina Li, a senior majoring in health promotion and disease prevention, said she will be living at home next year while she applies for medical school.
“It will be nice to be back and be with family again,” Li said. “I appreciate them more after being away from them for a while. Living at home will be a nice transition while I wait to hear back from job positions and while I apply for medical school.”
Li said most of her friends will not be living with their parents after graduation.
“A lot of my friends are staying in [Los Angeles] and signing leases near USC because they are familiar with the area,” Li said. “A lot of them move back close to home, but it’s not because their parents live there.”
Great article, but as a parent who has kids at USC and kids who have moved home I feel like I should share a little advice http://www.mymove.com/tips-advice/lifestyle/teens/moving-out-of-the-house-when-your-adult-child-wont-let-go
While it’s great to have them home, it’s also important to push your kids to bigger and better things. Some of my friend’s have kids who moved home and now they just sit on the couch all day.

The Harman Family Foundation made a $10-million gift to endow the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study, located in Doheny Memorial Library.
The USC Harman Academy for Polymathic Study comprises students and faculty, who research multidisciplinary topics. The academy programs research topics, such as the relationship between poetry and business and the relationship between space, time and feminism.
Curiosity · USC Libraries received a $10-million donation to endow the USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study in Doheny Library. - Ani Kolangian | Daily Trojan
The study is named after Sidney Harman, former chairman of the academy and professor of business. Sidney Harman died in 2011 at the age of 92.
President C. L. Max Nikias said the academy programs transcend traditional academic boundaries and encourage creativity, and represent the visions of Sidney Harman.
“At the heart of USC’s academic mission is our commitment to promote not only the study of multiple disciplines, but also to integrate many branches of learning in an effort to expand knowledge and foster new discoveries,” Nikias said in a statement.
Nikias said the donation will encourage students to explore multidisciplinary subjects.
“Sidney Harman was a gifted polymath in his own right and, through this inspiring gift from USC trustee Jane Harman and the Harman Family Foundation, this remarkable academy is a testament to his hope that students employing a polymathic approach to education will also derive greater personal wisdom and sound judgment.”
The USC Sidney Harman Academy for Polymathic Study exemplifies Sidney Harman’s innovative spirit, said his wife Jane Herman, a USC trustee and former congresswoman.
“Our family lived with a father and husband who inhaled life — and wanted his tombstone, if any, to say ‘still curious,’” Jane Harman said.
Catherine Quinlan, dean of USC Libraries, said the endowment will help fund new programs and the academy and continue Sidney Harman’s vision.
“With this generous support from the Harman Family Foundation, we will proudly continue this work that is so unique to USC and that Sidney viewed as so essential to the future of academic inquiry,” Quinlan said.
The USC Harman Academy for Polymathic Study will induct its 2012-2013 class on May 10.

A panel of experts discussed the state of the California Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors Act and the feasibility of the nationwide Dream Act on Monday at an event titled Undocumented Students, Unauthorized Immigrants, and the Future of America in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
The California Dream Act, signed by Gov. Jerry Brown in October, aims to make financial aid available to undocumented college students.
Debate · Jonathan Wilcox (left), speechwriter for former Calif. Gov. Peter Wilson, argued against a federal Dream Act at a panel hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on Tuesday. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
The panel, moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, discussed the financial and moral implications of providing financial aid to undocumented individuals hoping to pursue higher education.
“The Dream Act is about citizenship and equalization of funding opportunities to higher education,” said panelist Jonathan Wilcox, a speechwriter for former Calif. Gov. Pete Wilson.
The panel focused on the financial restraints the Dream Act could place on the government, the legality of the Dream Act and immigration reform.
Wilcox said the California Dream Act diverts funding away from other government-funded programs, which should be a higher priority.
“Every dollar that a state spends on one thing is one dollar less that it has to spend on something else,” Wilcox said.  “Are you harming [undocumented students] by denying them other opportunities?”
Luis Alvarado, former senior advisor for Meg Whitman’s California gubernatorial campaign, said the Dream Act raises more than just financial issues.
“These are morality issues,” Alvarado said. “Should there be government help in which the government is an accumulation of all of the resources of a community?”
Undocumented immigrants are presently contributing to the American economy through taxes but are still being denied access to financial aid opportunities funded by taxes, said William Perez, associate professor of education at Claremont Graduate University and author of We ARE Americans: Undocumented Students Pursuing the American Dream.
“When we talk about whether we can afford it, we have to understand that undocumented workers are already contributing,” Perez said.
Perez said that with a high school diploma being a less valuable degree than it was 30 years ago, a college degree is a necessity for financial success in the United States today and that by denying students opportunities to pursue scholarships and funding, the government would be limiting the chances of success for undocumented college students.
“If we don’t give kids access, we give them a literal disability, because they can’t function in society,” Perez said.
Michael Varela, chairperson for Improving Dreams, Education, Access and Success Movement at USC, said with the growing number of minorities in the United States, it is only a matter of time before a federal Dream Act is passed.
“This [Dream Act] is a vibrant, political, economic and moral issue that all USC students should discuss and ask questions about,” Suro said.
Schnur said if students want to make an impact on the passage of a federal Dream Act, they need to get involved in the government.
“Protesting is noble, rallying is moving, but if you want to get something done for a cause like this, the way to do it is to get inside the gate. All ralliers are making their voice heard, but if you’re making change, you have to be inside the doors and make something happen,” Schnur said.
“Perez said that with a high school diploma being a less valuable degree than it was 30 years ago, a college degree is a necessity for financial success in the United States today…”
Are you serious?..Because that’s not true. The part that’s not true is about the college degree. These idiots who try to disseminate this notion of “college = sureshot to upward mobility” are so delusional. It depends on many things such as: One’s degree, whether it’s a WEAK, FUTILE, and worst of all, academically easy degree vs. a rigorous, competitive degree; the economy; which industry is seeking new hires, and so forth. That is SO DUMB to rashly think “college degree = guarantee.” 
A blue collar person with vocational training usually fares much better, economically, than most college graduates THESE DAYS.
Yeah cause there’s ton of “vocational training” at such a low cost and there’s hundreds of employers giving living wage positions with good benefits and positive long term benefits at that job. look at the big picture buddy boy
Those are some bold statements.  Maybe you should have attended the discussion or, if you WERE there, you should have spoken up.  I would have loved for some more opposition from the student audience because, even though the sun had gone down when the event began, you would have been schooled thoroughly.
Furthermore, I would love to see the sources for your statements or better yet, the research you have conducted to come to these conclusions, because let me tell you, both Professor Suro and Dr. William Perez have done plenty of it and they can support their statements with both qualitative and quantitative data.
I may not be an expert but from experience I can tell you that even if, and that’s a HUGE if, your statement on the value of vocational training were true, the adult schools and community colleges that offer these services are seeing huge cuts to their budgets and 1) classes are underfunded and 2) space is even more limited than before.  The attacks on the upward mobility of all are only increasing as this recession continues and it is going to take compassionate policies such as the DREAM Act to rectify long-seated and recently imposed disadvantages to those who cannot outright pay for all the services and education that they need.
In ending, I would like you to know that this reply was not a personal attack on yourself.  I am certain that you are a bright individual.  It is the state of mind and lack of factual information of dissenters that I chose to address.  I can only hope that if you are truly interested in such issues and public policies that you take the time to access information from multiple sources in order to form an educated opinion.
Fight On!
@ Mike V, what really went down? Is there a recording of it on YT?
There shouldn’t be a video recording on YouTube, it was a small room and I would have noticed someone recording the event all the way from the panel.  I did, however, use the voice recorder on my iPhone to record the entire event and am still figuring out how to email it to interested individuals (I dabbled with DropSend today and am waiting to hear if it has worked for those who I sent it to).
As for what really went down, every individual on that panel was fully represented by this article.  I was on the proponent side of the issue and even I will say that the opposition members’ messages suffered in this article — although they focused on the financial aspect, a common go-to argument, they did make other relevant points.  However, I am not completely surprised by the DT’s treatment of the event.  The DT has not given the issue great coverage in the last couple years and the best piece that has made print was a Letter to the Editor that IDEAS Movement at USC (the main organizer behind Tuesday’s event) submitted themselves (which was tucked away in that day’s issue.
The goal of this event, as part of Program Board’s school-wide EdMonth initiative, was to bring in both sides of the issue and have an inclusive conversation.  I am happy to say that this was achieved and many in attendance congratulated us for having put on, as one USC administrator frankly put it, “one of the best SC programs I’ve seen [because] there [were] some great debates between panelist, wonderful questions raised by students and all this resulted in thought provoking dialogue afterwards.”
The key difference hear being DIALOGUE.  Look forward to more of this from IDEAS Movement at USC:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/284671061546280/
Regrettably, this article does not do justice to the depth of the debate last night and it missed a few key points while misrepresenting others. The DT stumbles again.

Freshman guard Alexis Moore will transfer after requesting his release from the school, his father, Barry, confirmed to the Daily Trojan Tuesday night.
His request is expected to be made official on Wednesday, allowing him to contact other schools.
Freshman guard Alexis Moore will be the third Trojan this offseason to transfer schools. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
ESPNLA first reported the story.
Moore, a 6-foot-2 guard from Long Beach, appeared in all 32 games for the Trojans last season – starting 18 – and averaged 4.3 points and 2 rebounds per contest.
“I wish him nothing but the best,” USC coach Kevin O’Neill said. “He did a great job for us this year. He’ll be successful wherever he is going.”
With the return of senior guard Jio Fontan from an ACL injury, it had been expected he would serve primarily as a backup next season.
Recruited as a part of the team’s 2011 recruiting class, Moore becomes the third Trojan this offseason to transfer. Sophomore forward Curtis Washington, who did not play last season because of torn labrum, has also requested his release, O’Neill confirmed.
Sophomore forward Garrett Jackson was granted his release by the school last week. He has reportedly been contacted by several West Coast Conference schools.
It is not known yet where either Jackson, Moore or Washington intends to transfer to.

At the football team’s first practice since returning from spring break, USC junior receiver Robert Woods announced that he will miss the remainder of spring practice.
Sidelined · Junior Robert Woods led the Trojans with 15 touchdown receptions in 2011. He is recovering from offseason ankle surgery. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“[The ankle’s] not completely healed, but it’s almost there,” Woods said.
Though he was a first-team All-American wideout and the presumptive No. 1 receiver, Woods’ ankle plagued him all of last season.
“After continuing evaluations on Robert, we thought he would almost be full strength by now,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “He’s had a setback — [the ankle’s] not healing fast, so our doctors recommend that we sit him to be sure to make sure it heals.”
Kiffin preferred that Woods be on the field as soon as possible, but he knew that Woods had to sit some time out to fully heal the ankle.
“Watching him, he’s still limping around, and the whole thing was that we [had surgery] in the offseason to have this thing fixed,” Kiffin said. “We have to get [his ankle] right no matter what, no matter how much time that is, to make sure we don’t have to go through that again.”
Kiffin called redshirt sophomore linebacker Hayes Pullard one of the standout players in camp so far.
“He ended up with the tie for lead in tackles on the team last year. He understands the system more now,” Kiffin said. “He’s a leader and he’s very aggressive in his style of play.”
Pullard was a very good all-around player last season, but he has plenty to improve on — and he knows it.
“[Linebacker coach Scottie Hazelton] and [former linebacker coach Joe Barry] just told me to be a peak performer at everything,” Pullard said. “I want to be better all around so I can be the best linebacker there is.”
Pullard stated that having the older linebackers on the roster to teach them helped him and his fellow linebackers.
“It was a real benefit having seniors in Shane Horton and Chris Galippo — even though they were behind us and in front of us sometimes — teaching us young guys. They didn’t care about nothing else,” Pullard said. “It was a brotherhood and a big team effort to teach one another.”
Kiffin experimented on Tuesday by having sophomore linebacker Tre Madden line up at running back as a result of some creative thinking over spring break.
“This is the time to try [experimenting with players at new positions]. It may not work at all, but as you go back and look at our testing — height, weight and speed — he would be one of the best guys on our whole team,” Kiffin said.
He said that Madden was excited to try out tailback. Kiffin plans to run Madden as running back throughout this week and evaluate after Saturday’s practice.
“If it works out, then we’ve got something we don’t have right now,” Kiffin said. “If it doesn’t, we’ll go back.”
Notable players that did not participate in Tuesday’s practice were redshirt sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey, senior center Khaled Holmes, redshirt sophomore quarterback Jesse Scroggins, sophomore wideout George Farmer, redshirt sophomore tight end Xavier Grimble, senior safety Drew McAllister, redshirt junior linebacker Marquise Simmons and redshirt freshman tight end Junior Pomee.

The USC women’s golf team captured its first victory of the season Tuesday, channeling a strong performance on the final day into a long-awaited win at the Battle of Rancho Bernardo in San Diego.
The Women of Troy finished 14-over-par 590, two strokes ahead of second-place Arizona State (592). Texas A&M finished third at 596, and UC Berkeley took fourth at 597. The tournament, hosted by San Diego State University, featured 16 teams and was held at the Rancho Bernardo Inn Championship Golf Course.
The Women of Troy were led by sophomore Sophia Popov, who finished at 2-under-par 142 and won the tournament. The victory marked her first of the season and her fourth overall, following the three wins she captured during her freshman campaign in 2010-2011. Popov finished two strokes ahead of Texas A&M’s Patricia Garcia (144) and one ahead of the University of Miami’s Jennifer Hirano (145).
The tournament was scheduled to last three days; however, rain wiped out play on Sunday, with the competition being converted to a 36-hole format in place of the traditional 54. Damp, gloomy conditions persisted and created considerable struggle Monday, but the Trojans received a strong effort from Popov, who notched three birdies and two bogeys to finish tied for third at 1-under-par 71. Freshman Doris Chen continued her strong spring season with 1-over-par 73 finish, including three birdies, to place ninth. Senior Inah Park came in tied for 22nd at 3-over-par 75, while sophomore Rachel Morris tied for 27th at 4-over-par 76. All-American senior Lisa McCloskey, who started off strong with two birdies through the first three holes, struggled to score a 7-over-par 79 and tied for 58th.
Popov opened the second round with a birdie and two bogeys on the front nine, then notched back-to-back birdies on the 11th and 12th holes to finish 1-under-par 71 for the round and 2-under-par for the tournament. Chen recorded her third consecutive               top-10 finish, shooting 2-over-par 74 in the final round to finish tied for ninth at 147 overall. Park posted her fourth top-20 finish this year, tying for 15th at 5-over-par 149. Morris shot a 6-over-par 78 to finish tied for 35th at 10-over-par 154, while McCloskey recorded a 4-over-par 76 to come in tied for 45th at 11-over-par 155.
The victory was not only a welcome sight for Popov, whose wrist injury hampered her success in the fall, but for the entire team, especially after surrendering the lead at the last tournament.
“We played very solid golf and just didn’t give shots away,” Popov said. “We used the wind to our advantage and saved some really good pars at the end.”
The Women of Troy will next participate in the PING/ASU Invitational, held at Karsten Golf Course in Phoenix March 31 through April 2nd.

It’s not easy being a head coach at USC.
If you win, it’s expected of you. If you don’t, people start wondering why. And if you find yourself somewhere in the middle, you sort of get lost in the shuffle.
Strangely, Bill Ferguson, the USC men’s volleyball coach, has found himself lost in the shuffle.
Winning ways · USC volleyball coach Bill Ferguson might not be a household name, but he has led the Trojans to two Final Fours. - Daily Trojan file photo
Maybe it’s because he shares the university with high-profile coaches such as Lane Kiffin, Jovan Vavic and Peter Smith.
Maybe it’s because he’s had top-notch players like opposite Murphy Troy and senior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli who have made his life easier.
Maybe it’s because the greatest coach to ever walk on a volleyball court, Al Scates, has spent the last 50 years crafting a legacy only 20 miles away.
Or maybe, just maybe, we’ve simply lost sight of a man who quietly goes about his business.
Though it’s more than understandable to see fans clamor at the re-emergence of the football and baseball programs over the past six months, when did sustained success become boring?
The men’s volleyball team hasn’t raised a banner at the Galen Center or Heritage Hall in recent years, but when evaluating the best of the athletic program, Ferguson and his team deserve their dues.
In the early ’90s, the USC men’s volleyball program was the premier program on campus and around the country. Playing at the raucous North Gym, the Trojans used the loudest home-court advantage in the nation en route to a national championship in 1990 and a 1991 runner-up season that was fueled by a school-record 30-match win streak.
When Ferguson took over 15 years later, however, the Cardinal and Gold were a shell of the program they used to be. He inherited a USC squad that hadn’t made the NCAA tournament, let alone the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation tournament since 2001 or swept rival UCLA, also a perennial powerhouse, since 1991.
Flash forward six years, and it seems anything the 41-year-old coach touched turned to gold.
The program has made the MPSF tournament every year during his tenure, two trips to the Final Four — including a heartbreaking loss in 2009 to UC Irvine in the final — a current 10-match win streak and the No. 3 spot in the national rankings and, most importantly, they’ve done it with high-character players.
It’s a transformation that starts with the man at the top: Ferguson.
Every week since the season began, I have had the privilege of talking a few minutes with him about the team’s upcoming week, and if you’ve ever seen him in action on the sidelines of an intense match, he’s the same guy. Rain or shine, Monday afternoon in his office or Saturday night against UC Irvine.
Cool, calm and loving life.
And why shouldn’t he be?
The role of the coach cannot be understated. They spend more hours with their players and coaching staffs than they do with their wives, children and friends. If they win, their players get to bask in the praise. If they lose, their livelihoods are at stake.
It’s a high-stakes profession that takes a rare kind of person, and Ferguson fits that mold.
He’s unflappable, genial and the ultimate player’s coach.
He prefers substance over style, fundamentals over flash and demands his players play the game “the right way.”
Often in our conversations, I try to throw in a personal question. He doesn’t blink.
Even as he captured his 100th career victory last weekend in a road win over UC Santa Barbara, Ferguson was still all about giving the credit to the people he works with.
“[The win] was pretty special on a personal level,” Ferguson said. “For the most part, though, it speaks to the great coaches I have been able to work with since I’ve been here. And, more importantly, the great  student-athletes we’ve had the chance to coach since I got here. It doesn’t matter how much you know. You have to have great players to have any kind of success. It starts with them.”
Collegiate coaches like Ferguson are not hard to come by, but you have to choose whether or not you accept to believe that they exist. If anything, Ferguson should serve as an example that not every coach has his or her own sponsors,             multi-million dollar contracts or a lifetime guarantee of notoriety.
Maybe we lose sight of that if their accolades and credentials are not highlighted on an ESPN ticker or Twitter timeline.
Maybe it’s not trendy to most of us out there to coach a sport that isn’t a big moneymaker or widely appreciated on college campuses.
But if you asked Ferguson why he does what he does, he wouldn’t hesitate.
He coaches because he loves what collegiate athletics has the opportunity to stand for: the purity of the game, the journey and the chance to teach student-athletes.
He’s not the type of guy that sells tickets or the type that has viral potential, but he’s the perfect kind of guy for this university, the kind that recognizes that his job is to be the man behind the curtain and not the focal point of the action.
Though he hasn’t won a national championship or garnered enough attention for his own bobblehead night, Ferguson is entitled to more than a little spotlight.
He’s earned it.

Whenever the USC men’s volleyball squad is mentioned, senior All-American candidates Tony Ciarelli and Steven Shandrick are the names that quickly come to mind.
The Trojans’ squad, however, possesses a hidden star. He might have only been here for about a semester and a half, but middle blocker Robert Feathers is already among the nation’s best. Currently leading the nation in blocks with 1.64 per game for the  No. 2 Trojans, the freshman out of Loyola High School in Los Angeles has ruffled through opponents’ game plans all season and might already be top dog at his position.
Block party · Freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers and the Trojans have won 10 consecutive matches since losing to UCLA in February. Despite his youth, Feathers is the national leader in blocked shots. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
Though Feathers’ volleyball abilities speak volumes already, coach Bill Ferguson and his staff recruited a player who is never content to rely on his talent — especially because Feathers’ decision was between USC and that other school across town. When asked why he chose USC, Feathers mentioned a bond between player and coach, one stemming back seven years before Feathers was a touted recruit and before Ferguson had risen through the coaching ranks to where he stands today.
“I first met Coach at a SCVC [Southern California Volleyball Clinic] camp in sixth grade. We had a weird connection since we both went to the same middle school,” Feathers said. “I didn’t actually attend the camp; I just went to check it out and coach noticed me. He was having a two-week tryout and told me to come on out. I had no idea what I was doing, but he suggested I take up volleyball and you know what happened next.”
Considering Feathers was six-foot-six by the end of middle school and has grown two inches since, the position of middle blocker seemed natural. In volleyball, the middle blocker’s role is to attempt to block down any shot hit over the net. It requires timing, power and height. Luckily for Feathers, he has all three down pat.
“He’s one of, if not the, hardest-working guys in the gym,” Ferguson said. “He wants to be great, and does what it takes. You see the hard work and determination paying off.”
Though Feathers puts in his fair share of time in the weight room and on the court, his impressive transition to the faster-paced style of college volleyball has been aided by two important mentors. The first is assistant coach Jeff Nygaard, who has helped Feathers immensely by improving his swinging and hitting mechanics. Nygaard, who was a middle blocker himself as well as an Olympian during his playing days, has earned the admiration of his pupil.
“The guy is just ridiculous,” Feathers said.
Meanwhile, Shandrick has proven to be, in the words of Feathers, “an on-court version of Jeff.”
“I can always go to Steve to calm me down on the court,” said Feathers. Considering Shandrick’s three prior years of experience at the position and Feathers’ ever-improving skills, the two have turned into a formidable duo for any opposing squad.
Combined with the Trojans’ current 10-match winning streak, it would seem Feathers has something to hang his hat on. He has, however, only one focus.
When asked about how it feels to be the nation’s top blocker, he coolly replied, “I’m thrilled it’s happening, but achievement alone is not going to win a championship. We have to work hard as a team, and everyone needs to be on an equal level in order to win when it matters most.”
The Trojans might be hot now, but the NCAA tournament is when the team’s best play is needed. Despite the program’s prestige, the Trojans have not won a national title since 1990. In May, the Galen Center will host the mens’ volleyball Final Four and one can bet that the Trojans do not want this golden opportunity to take home the title on their home court to go to waste. Besides, for Feathers, what’s a better place to start off one’s career at USC than at the top?
Despite his initial success, Feathers still has his “freshman moments,” such as one of his shoes falling off not just once, but twice in a match. Fortunately, the freshman standout is neither dwelling on these mishaps or settling on his playing abilities.
“I’ve got a long ways to go, but it’s exciting to know I can get so much better,” Feathers said.
Considering his superb play and even better attitude toward the game, USC fans should be excited for the future as well.

Watching sports can be a complex experience, eliciting a variety of emotions ranging from pride to disappointment to anxiety to guilt.
Yes, guilt. You know the feeling: You’re watching your favorite athletes sweat profusely, tirelessly working toward a common goal and there you are, on your couch, throwing back cheese-dusted handfuls of chips and popcorn. Add pizza and beer to the equation and you might just enter self-loathing territory.
Junk-food consumption is almost intrinsically linked to the sports-viewing experience. But during March Madness, with day after day of NCAA basketball events, these eating habits can become especially lazy.
Preparing your own game day foods — that is, doing more of the work than the Frito-Lay factory does — can make the rituals of sports spectatorship more fulfilling.
Supermarkets sell pizza dough for little money, around $3 for a generous 12-ounce ball. Your favorite pizza joint might even sell dough.
It’s simple to flour, roll and sauce the dough on a baking sheet, and it can be done during a commercial break. Then, all you have to do is throw the sheet in a 450-degree oven until it’s baked to your desired doneness. The commitment is that simple.
Cookbooks exemplify this culinary ease. For instance, on Tuesday, Jim Lahey’s My Pizza was released. In the early 2000s, Lahey popularized the no-knead method of dough-making.
This book continues that tradition, but advocates pizza as the perfect base for unusual toppings. Corn, jalapeños, veal meatballs — it’s all fair game on a Lahey pie, and topping one should be just as exciting and personalized for you, too.
Your taste buds will thank you, should you purchase some really good cheese and meat to decorate your creation.
Whole Foods recently acquired Creminelli Fine Meats from Salt Lake City. I recommend the La Quercia prosciutto — barely salty, just-dry-enough strips of pork that will take your pizza from good to great.
The worthwhile effort — and it’s hardly any effort at that — cannot be overstressed. The assembly takes less time than waiting for pizza delivery. And watching your crust bake and bubble in the oven is far more satisfying than intently keeping your eyes glued to the Domino’s online tracking system.
Popcorn, like pizza, is a great foundation on which to incorporate interesting flavors.
If you’re microwaving a quick bag of popcorn, do yourself a serious favor and melt some chocolate while you’re at it. Popcorn with dark chocolate and sea salt is an ideal pairing: Scharffen Berger is a top quality chocolate, and melting some of the semisweet, 62-percent cacao chocolate bar will give popcorn a bit of an edge without entering too-bitter territory. It’s ideal when the melted chocolate hardens up on the popcorn with the sea salt.
Popcorn also supports spicier flavors, if you’re craving it. Flavored popcorn is readily available in stores but again, it’s a cinch to assemble yourself. Toss it with cayenne pepper or drizzle with a spice-infused oil, like one with chili peppers.
At home, you want to focus on foods that are really simple and not distracting while also being tastier than the majority of what’s consumed while plopped in front of the TV. Snacks like the ones mentioned here solve that issue.
Inside arenas and stadiums, however, where the quality of food offerings is being improved dramatically, one can find even more “upscale” treats.
In the last few months, Madison Square Garden has undergone a concessions “transformation” — their word, not mine — where you can dine at chicken and sausage stands sporting celebrity chef names.
Jean-Georges Vongerichten is an American culinary legend — three James Beard awards, an equal number of Michelin stars at his New York flagship restaurant Jean-Georges and four stars from The New York Times. His Simply Chicken is now among those offerings available at Madison Square Garden.
Simply Chicken won’t be Michelin-worthy, of course, but the venture makes sense. People want to eat — or rather believe that they’re eating — the best of the best. That’s why it’s also natural to extend this mentality to the home.
So why all the effort just to have something to eat during Syracuse vs. Wisconsin? Simple: Food can, as at a movie theater, circus or ball game, make a good viewing experience great.
And if your bracket is totally shot by the end of the week, at least you can look back fondly on that killer prosciutto-topped pizza.

There is sometimes an elitist attitude that community theaters shouldn’t take on big musicals such as Chicago, Les Misérables and the bloody macabre masterpiece that is Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street — or any Stephen Sondheim musical for that matter.
So it is commendable that director Valerie Rachelle and the Morgan-Wixson Theatre have taken on the tale of Sweeney Todd, played by the dashingly named John McCool Bowers; questionable direction and pacing issues, however, take away its ferocity and haunting power.
The plot should be familiar to those who have seen Tim Burton’s adaptation, the PBS recording of the musical production with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn as Mrs. Lovett and Sweeney respectively or heard the initial legend that the musical is based on.
Set in Victorian England, Benjamin Barker, a talented barber who had been falsely imprisoned by the corrupt Judge Turpin (Michael Heimos), returns to London after 15 years away, only to discover that his beloved wife Lucy poisoned herself and that his daughter Johanna (Natasha Harris) has been adopted by the same judge who put him in prison.
Taking on the name Sweeney Todd, Barker uses his barbering profession to take vengeance on the vermin of the earth, with those unsuspecting customers being used as the secret ingredient for the amoral Mrs. Lovett’s meat pies (AnnaLisa Erickson). As Sweeney pursues vengeance, the young sailor Anthony Hope (Vincent Perez) tries to save Johanna from Judge Turpin’s clutches.
Rather than using too many elements from Burton’s film, the Morgan-Wixson Theatre production adds its own unique touches to the musical. Sweeney is presented as a more boorish, powerful man of high stature rather than the tortured punk-rocker guise of Johnny Depp. Tobias, played by James Paul Xavier (who is also the set designer), is portrayed as a slow-witted childish man rather than an actual boy. Most scenes remain, although one or two are admittedly unnecessary, such as a set of parlor songs between Mrs. Lovett and Beadle Bamford (Tom McMahon).
Juggling themes of vengeance, madness, obsession and the wickedness of man, the musical is one of the pillars of the medium, bringing a harmonious complexity more akin to an opera than a regular Broadway musical. It’s a daunting play for any theater, but a production company — especially a community theater, — must be up to the task.  Anything less than perfection is going to stand out negatively.
The harmony between the ensemble and the lead roles captures the story’s intricacies, even in the particularly complex musical numbers “Pirelli’s Miracle Elixir” and the maddening “City on Fire/Searching.” The unity of the ensemble weakens a bit near the end — the final ballad doesn’t have the punch that it should.
The lead actors deliver adequate performances; the standout is Vincent Perez’s rendition of Anthony, arguably the only sinless character in the play. He not only brings a majestic bravado with his singing, but he brings the right balance of innocence and valor to the noble sailor.
John McCool Bowers brings a statuesque power and gravitas to the bloodthirsty barber, capable of reaching some very deep notes. The darkness and angst of the character come through even if the audience never seems to get the chance to see his rage truly consume him, but that has more to do with the pacing of the direction than Bowers’ performance.
The biggest issue with the production is that the pacing of the play doesn’t give important moments enough time to truly come into their own. The most jarring example is when Sweeney kills his first victim, a paramount moment for the character and the play as a whole. Despite the moment’s significance, the actual throat slitting happens instantly and without a reaction from Sweeney.
In addition, the characters  do not feel as demented as they should. Turpin isn’t as vile and perverted. Beadle, though sung and acted well by McMahon, isn’t as slimy as he should be. The flashy Anthony Pirelli (Brandon Stanford) isn’t as abusive or scheming. They feel a bit toothless and lack the inherent bloodlust of the original material.
But none of this gets in the way of the music; Sondheim’s symphonic compositions are sung nicely enough. If you’ve never seen the movie or the stage production, it is still worth heading over to Santa Monica to see the play. Even an average adaptation of Sweeney Todd is worth the price of admission because of the brilliance of the music and the tragic melodrama of Sweeney’s pursuit of vengeance.

Veteran soul singer, Lee Fields, is fighting time: Fields’ musical career has spanned 40 years, yet it seems only now that his investment into the art is paying great dividends.

Fields has cut soul records intermittently over the past four decades on various labels and it seems he has found a home, if only for a moment, at Truth & Soul Records. His second album on the label, Faithful Man, aims to add to his legacy.
It would be hard to describe Lee Fields’ sound without eventually framing him in the context of the great James Brown.
The similarity between the two men is astounding. Even Fields would describe his likeness to James Brown as “uncanny,” and this is probably the result of Fields’ first exposure to performance, when he was asked to cover a James Brown song.
But to suggest that Fields is something of a Brown impersonator would be misguided. If Fields borrows anything from Brown, it’s the vocal quality — one that is sharp with experience and full of a power lodged deep within his soul.
Fields jumps immediately into a fit of turbulent energy with the title track “Faithful Man.” The song highlights Fields’ vocals, surrounded with a gutsy ensemble of drums, horns, organ, piano and guitar as he explores two alternating scenes.
The first part of the track features a punchy groove over which Fields bellows his regrets. “I’ve always been a faithful man, till you came along,” Fields sings. The second part situates Fields comfortably in the pocket of a drum and bass jam while he recounts the story of his downfall.
Fields settles down on “Still Hanging On” and the listener catches glimpses of a more fragile frontman. Lost love is a thematic favorite for any soul singer, but Fields’ version of that familiar story on the track seems increasingly honest compared to these of his contemporaries, probably due in part to a lifetime’s worth of emotional experience.
Love songs often employ lyrics that make the experience of love seem universal. Where some songwriters intend to provide an accessible experience for their listeners, Fields approaches the subject with an ownership of his experience and no one else’s.
In this regard, the effect of deep reflection and timeworn emotion coursing through Fields might make this record feel tailored to provoke certain emotions, even when in reality it’s just the cool distillation of one man’s story.
Fields sits out on track five, aptly called “Intermission,” giving himself a moment to figuratively breathe. The band that supports Fields throughout the record here ventures off unaided to explore a soothing lounge groove, finally returning with a simple tune to introduce the second half of Faithful Man.
Whether intentional or not, “Intermission” breaks the album into two separate pieces. In contrast with a first half that feels top-heavy with standout songs, the second half shows off emotive material that’s worthy of a listen.
“Wish You Were Here” is fraught with the same frustration as “Faithful Man,” but Fields seems to dig deeper to realize the nature of his pain. “No traces of you, what can I do? / Alone and confused,” Fields waxes. It is on tracks like “Wish You Were Here” that listeners can witness Fields’ exceptional ability to transform emotion into melody and harmony.
The following track, “Who Do You Love,” is inquisitive in nature but sunny in its disposition. Fields addresses a deceitful lover, aided musically by background singers.
Also included on Faithful Man is Fields’ cover of the Rolling Stones’ ballad “Moonlight Mile,” which was originally released in early January by Mojo as part of a tribute to the Rolling Stones’ 1971 album Sticky Fingers.
Sonically, Faithful Man covers much of the same territory as his freshman release on Truth & Soul Records, My World. What Faithful Man lacks in exploration of a new sound, however, it compensates with its spectrum of emotions covered. There is certainly room, though, for Fields to push further in both directions. On the final track “Walk on Thru That Door,” for instance, Fields demonstrates a progression in his sound with some weighty guitar riffs but ultimately leaves the listener wanting more.
Though Fields believed his career ended in the ’70s, he was unable to shake his love for music. It’s clear now, that if patience is a virtue, Fields knows a thing or two about it.
And if Fields’ residency at Truth & Soul is his second chance at a career that left off in the ’70s, it’s also clear that it’s an opportunity rightly deserved and expertly seized on Faithful Man.

What began as a mere spark of an idea in author Suzanne Collins’ mind, while she was simultaneously flipping between coverage of the war in Iraq and a reality television show, has swept the nation, creating a literary and cinematic phenomenon that rivals the likes of Harry Potter, Twilight and even Star Wars.
This craze is The Hunger Games, the novel-turned-movie that has had the world salivating since its production was announced in 2009.
Ultimate fighter · Jennifer Lawrence (middle) stars in The Hunger Games as a girl who steps in for her sister in the annual fight to the death between citizens of the various districts in her home country of Panem. - Photo courtesy of Murray Close
The film and books tell the remarkable story of 16-year-old heroine Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) who lives in the fictional post-apocalyptic, dystopian nation of Panem — formerly North America — consisting of 12 districts under the cruel dictatorship of the Capitol.
As a twisted punishment for a past uprising, the Capitol has enforced an annual nationally televised event called The Hunger Games, forcing one girl and one boy from each district to compete to the death until only one survivor remains.
So when Katniss’ little sister is selected as the female contender from District 12, Katniss instinctively volunteers to take her place and fight to the death with 23 other contenders, forcing her to rely on her sharp instincts, survival skills and the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson).
Producer Nina Jacobson worked tirelessly with Lions Gate Entertainment and Collins to capture the horror and inhumanity of the Games, while also allowing the film to examine the rich themes of personal sacrifice, star-crossed love and the harrowing future facing our society.
Jacobson and Lions Gate created a team headed by director Gary Ross, who offered the perfect fusion of epic and intimate storytelling abilities coupled with a deep passion and love for Katniss’ story.
“It was very clear that Gary really understood the book at the most fundamental level and that he could really appreciate [the story] from a fan and directorial point of view,” Jacobson said.
Ross felt an immediate connection to the book, spawned from the eager and passionate reactions of his own young children and the important messages he gleaned from the subject matter.
“This film is about the preservation of your humanity in the face of a system that seeks to rob you of your humanity, and that is something that I’ll always want to make a movie about,” Ross said. “If nobody had never heard this story, I would still want to make a movie about it.”
Then came the daunting task of casting the film, which was all the more challenging because of the fans’ voices with strong opinions of how the film should look.
“Everybody who reads it has a clear vision in their head of what the book should look like because the book is so personal to everybody, which is great,” Ross said. “But my job is to decide what connects to me personally because, as a director, that’s all you have.”
For the role of Katniss, Ross knew almost immediately after his first audition with Lawrence that she was not simply the right choice but the only choice.
“I have seen a lot of actors in my life, but I have never worked with someone more talented than Jennifer,” Ross gushed. “There’s a strength, an authority, a no-BS attitude to her that is everything Katniss represents.”
Lawrence, who previously admitted hesitancy in taking on roles in big-name Hollywood hits, ultimately realized that even in light of the fame, spotlight and possible stereotyping that the job would bring, the role of Katniss Everdeen was one she could not turn down.
“[Katniss] is incredible, iconic, heroic — this Joan of Arc — and if you’re going to be typecast for one character, it should be the best character you’ve ever read, and that’s what she was,” Lawrence said.
The rest of the cast includes an array of actors spanning every generation from the 13-year-old Amandla Stenberg in the pivotal role of Rue to the legendary Donald Sutherland as the brilliant yet twisted President Snow, Katniss’s chief adversary.
The cast even boasts one of USC’s own, sophomore Alexander Ludwig in the key role of Cato, the most fearsome of the tributes, whose final showdown with Katniss and Peeta is one of the most moving and gut-wrenching moments of the film, exposing the true corrosion of humanity inflicted by the Games.
Though the story yields a different meaning on a personal level to anyone who reads it, the cast agrees on a common modern implication of the story.
“We live in a world where our past, present and future have been defined by governments controlling their people by keeping them hungry and weak so they are not strong enough to fight back,” Lawrence said. “That is what this movie is about. We are the generation that can fight back.”
Sutherland, too, believes in the immense power of the underlying themes of The Hunger Games.
“This film has the possibility to change everything — to motivate, to catalyze, to activate whatever revolutionary instincts there are in what is essentially, a dormant generation,” Sutherland said. “This film could make them stand up and become aware through this allegory, the political structure that they live in and what needs to be changed. They could all become Katniss Everdeen.”
Sounds like life under an obama-type regime. The ‘future’ isn’t that far off kids.
Sounds like a pretty tried and true hollywood blockbuster that flirts with Orwellian overtones when its not zooming in for the date kiss scene

In an emergency, time is of the essence. If a car is stolen, for example, any delays in the search reduce the owner’s chance of finding it again.
But something like a stolen car is not a matter of life or death. In this respect, there are few emergencies more urgent than fires. In every second of delay, property that can never be recovered is destroyed.
For this reason, the systems responsible for receiving information about emergencies and sending out help have to operate as reliably and efficiently as possible. For the most part, they work exactly as they should. A series of recent malfunctions in the L.A. area, however, have raised serious concerns over the reliability of the systems in place.
The current systems are flawed to the point of requiring repair.
When the systems function correctly, multiple alerts activate in the fire station nearest the emergency. As a further safeguard, stations are instructed to monitor radio channels in case there is a lost alert.
Over the last few weeks, parts of these systems have failed — with grave consequences. According to a March 17 article in the Los Angeles Times, notification failures led to an incident on March 2, when a fire in South Los Angeles killed two people. The Times further reported that on March 7, paramedics near Torrance took 45 minutes to provide care to a woman whose finger had been dismembered by her workplace’s equipment.
The dispatch equipment has gotten older and has become more prone to crashes and glitches. It is working almost perfectly, but “almost” is not a luxury an operation like firefighting can afford. In the wrong situation, a delay like one of those that occurred could lead to a catastrophic result.
The fact that Mayor Villaraigosa has ordered a review is very promising, but these problems must be fixed as soon as possible. The firefighters of the Los Angeles County do a valiant job every day, but if these small flaws in the system are not fixed, their work might not be enough.

Two weeks ago, Invisible Children co-founder Jason Russell moved millions of people with his video detailing the horror wreaked in Uganda by warlord Joseph Kony.
Jonathan Zhang | Daily Trojan
As support for Kony 2012 reached unprecedented levels, Russell rocked the nation yet again. This time, however, it was not quite so inspiring.
Though being detained by San Diego police for alleged public masturbation does not make Russell as despicable a character as Kony, it has certainly damaged the carefully constructed image of activist, community leader and family man he put forth in his documentary. The documentary told the story of Russell’s personal experiences in Uganda and explained the problem of child soldiers through a conversation with his young son.
By tying his organization’s cause to his personal life, Russell took a big risk. Viewers linked Russell directly with the Kony 2012 campaign, as well as the rest of Invisible Children’s work. Though this personal touch allowed the video to affect audiences more deeply than a mere fact-based documentary ever could, it also caused viewers to hold Russell to a higher standard — a standard he has failed abysmally to meet.
And though he might not be fit to run a campaign — let alone direct an organization — Russell’s cause should not be abandoned or deemed unworthy.
Everyone who has watched the Kony 2012 video now associates the cause at least somewhat with Russell’s personal life. And now that he has so publicly and obscenely made a mess of the latter, people are hesitant to support the cause at all. Instead of rousing people to action in the name of social justice, Russell’s name now calls to mind only embarrassment and instability.
Russell’s intimate connection with the film could also shed some light on the cause of his apparent mental breakdown. His wife told reporters Friday that, while attention on the video was “great for raising awareness about Joseph Kony, it also brought a lot of attention to Jason and, because of how personal the film is, many of the attacks against it were also very personal, and Jason took them very hard.”
Her statement might not make the episode easier to stomach, but it is an important reminder that Russell did not behave with malicious intent.
Both Invisible Children and the public have a vital role to play in the aftermath of Russell’s detention, which is to disassociate Russell’s personal issues from the issue at large: Joseph Kony continues to perpetrate gross atrocities on the people of multiple African nations, including Uganda and the Congo.
No person originally galvanized by Kony 2012 should back out of the Kony awareness movement just because of Russell’s actions. Should our confidence in Invisible Children decrease? Naturally. Facts, however, remain facts. Kony, as confirmed by the International Criminal Court and countless other international and humanitarian groups, was destroying lives long before the police found Russell running around in his underwear and pounding the sidewalk with his fists.
Supporters don’t need to cater to Russell, or his organization, to stop Kony. Entities such as the United Nations, Amnesty International and the Enough Project all offer the necessary advocacy and educational tools.
We should not forget that, regardless of what happened afterward, Invisible Children accomplished one of its central missions: to spread the word about the evil done by Kony. Now that we have the word, what are we doing about it?
Forget Russell. Forget Invisible Children if you feel so inclined. But that’s still no excuse not to answer the question.

People said it was a scam on his video on youtube.com
I was skeptical at first but this reinforces the fact that  it is.
Nice article. Let’s hope the behavior of Russell and the highly questionable integrity of Invisible Children doesn’t cause people to simply sleep on this issue.
Class of ’67 here.  
Might it be you who are narrowing the question to a yes or no response?
This post-movie psychotic behavior of Russell’s, replete with his stripping down to total exposure, to wildly animated, irrational acts and words which was followed by explanations, excuses, drug inducement charges and denials, highly professional damage-control PR-advisor-crafted vague phraseologies, and a plethora of exposures of inaccurate facts within the video by Invisible Children, all the way to a denial of accuracy by the Prime Minister of Uganda are a cornucopia of thought provoking insights and challenging and shocking ideas.
Those challenging ideas are what USC prides itself on.  Excellence in Education.  Excellence in seizing on the many new ideas as the bases for intellectually stimulating, intellectually challenging thought.
What a rare learning opportunity.  As a first year student, this is a hens tooth moment when you can see what was meant by “the media is the message”, when you can see the power of politics, of biases at work, of news and opinion writers tattooed by their prior utterances.  What an enriching intellectual moment.  Lies, intentional, consequential to misrepresentation, mistakes, innocent and in service to a political agenda, and the consequence of inadequate, possibly incompetent research, and hastily drawn conclusions are around this topic, like the Rose Garden’s hundreds of varieties just across the street from Campus.
Again, might you be narrowing the questions a bit hastily?  
Thanks for the article as it shows you’ve worked the topic.  I’d just like to ask you to step back, up to the 40,000 foot level, and look at all the pieces to this situation which imo demands broad, nearly unframed thinking because what you and I, and so many millions have just experienced, exposure to a very inaccurate, biased political video supporting what each decent human being wants, non-violence and justice, and further exposure to a public vetting of the facts and the conclusions, all strong influences on our innocence and ignorance about not just Kony but sea of additional facts and factors.
As a USC undergrad, it’s my my hope that you will reflect on this reaction to your editorial and as an outstanding student stretch to become much more empowered, via the excellent faculty and classmates, to further evolve to be one of those who can be pointed to as a graduate who drew from her experience at USC the rich veins of educational and intellectual excellence, with an exceptionally probed and refined capacity to analyze critically and multifactedly, and in turn be a valued member of American society.

The average trajectory of a star in the acting industry doesn’t involve starting out in a Dr. Seuss-inspired movie before becoming a rock star.
But then again, there is no such thing as an average path in the entertainment business and Taylor Michel Momsen isn’t the average actress.
Famous for her cutesy role in How The Grinch Stole Christmas and later for her role as Jenny Humphrey on the TV show Gossip Girl. Now, though, her days are spent interviewing and playing another role altogether as front woman of the rock band The Pretty Reckless.
After traveling with the Vans Warped Tour and then doing their own shows, the band is gearing up for more performances, continuing Momsen’s journey.
“The Medicine Tour” kicked off March 9 and will bring shows everywhere from Seattle to Vancouver to Los Angeles. The band will also release a new EP later this year and will play alongside Marilyn Manson in its upcoming tour. But the spotlight almost always shines on front woman Momsen and with good reason.
For a girl that went from a very Gossip Girl demeanor to a hard-rock, eyeliner-heavy look, 18-year-old Momsen received a lot of attention when she first began touring. Yet as much as Momsen drew comparisons to rock figures like Courtney Love, especially because of her distinctly deep and semi-raspy voice, she sees her image and her sound as something more.
“[Those comparisons are] mostly just interviewers,” said Momsen. “I don’t hear from that fans or people that I know. Everyone wants to put a label on you so you’re easier to understand, so it’s easier to understand the whole thing. There’s not a lot of females in rock ‘n’ roll so the comparisons are understandable but I’m doing my own thing. I think I’m doing something different.”
And while Momsen’s high profile could accustom her to the tight schedule of being in a band, she never quite predicted where she’d be today.
“The only goal was to be able to make records and to make new music and to write good songs. I never thought about it, about where it would go,” said Momsen. “The biggest thing I’ve learned is to kind of let things go naturally and the course they’re meant to go in and not to force anything. And to stay true to my own conviction and my own vision and not bend for anyone for the industry or any sort of outside force. Sometimes it’s a fight but I think it’s worth it at the end of the day.”
While the move from actress to musician oftentimes proves risky, Momsen sees the change as liberating.
“There’s definitely a lot more spontaneity [in the music world],” said Momsen. “What I love about it so much is that I get to write my own songs and sing them. I don’t have to play a character. They’re both great, but acting was pretty much a job.”
In the end, the move from the acting world to the music world turns into more than changes in scheduling. For Momsen, it’s less a job and more of a passion.
“Having the opportunity to only do music and having to do other jobs as well is such a blessing and so amazing and to have that be my only focus is awesome,” said Momsen. “The goal has always kinda been the same thing: to make records and continue doing that. I want to do that for the rest of my life and if I can do that, it’s amazing.”
While most of the tracks on the band’s album Light Me Up are strung together by heavy guitar chords and unabashedly honest lyrics, the band’s new video for “You” also shows a more sensitive side. In fact, Momsen doesn’t stick to the average Courtney Love image, as much as it might seem on the surface. She’s not a fan of flying and she stocks up on lentil soup when on tour and the experience of being in a band has taught her a lot already.
“My perspective of what good is has definitely evolved,” said Momsen. “We’ve gotten the opportunity to tour with so many bands from Evanescnesce to Guns n Roses to [Marilyn] Manson to Foo Fighters, so to be able to watch some of the greatest bands around right now and learn from them has helped my perspective.”
With the current tour under way and a new EP coming soon, the band and Momsen are at a point where they can only keep growing. And Momsen’s no-gimmicks attitude only adds to the band’s unique personality.
“There’s no pre-show ritual,” said Momsen. “I put my shoes on and smoke a cigarette, and we go on.”
And after a long journey in the world of entertainment, sometimes that’s all you really need.

If anything should set off warning lights, it’s a horror film based around a gimmick.
In a genre that already has a tendency to appear creatively anemic, a simple shakeup in presentation is one of the most viable ways to attract the attention of audiences. It’s at this point, though, that potential viewers should be the most wary.
Is the conceit of the movie indicative of greater inventive flourishes to come, as with the commercially and critically successful Paranormal Activity series? Or did the filmmakers have one lone spark of imagination and assume it could carry them all the way to success?
Silent House, from directors Chris Kentis and Laura Lau, belongs firmly in the latter camp.
From the opening shot onwards, the film progresses in real time over one continuous take, an ambitious undertaking that hopes to offset the very mundane setup: Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen), her father (Adam Trese) and her uncle (Eric Sheffer Stevens) have gathered to clean out their old lakeside retreat. The general air of unease quickly escalates into terror as vague, bad things start to happen in the dark.
Yes, that is the most general premise to a thriller ever devised, but a deep or complex storyline would have been nearly impossible to pull off in a movie that opts never to cut or edit what’s shot, so that can be excused. In truth, a fair amount of details are layered into the opening ten or fifteen minutes, and in a film like this, economy of information is an absolute necessity. Sure enough, whether its ultimate purpose is to foreshadow or misdirect, each scrap of information has a purpose.
That sounds like a compliment, and it would be if not for that fact that the eventual payoff is a deeply unsatisfying reveal. And the ending is one that feels like a betrayal of the implicit promise the film makes to the audience at the outset: that viewers will observe events depicted as they happen in real time.
The conclusion is such that this can’t possibly be the case, and ironically enough, the only thing that makes the story unique is what ultimately defeats it. If the movie were shot in almost any other way — save found footage a la the aforementioned Paranormal Activity films — it would be forgivable to employ a misleading visual representation of exactly how events transpire.   Here, that’s not the case.
The ending is far from the only problem, though, with Trese and Sheffer’s performances as the father and uncle each earning a fair amount of chuckles for awkward, stilted delivery — only some of which was intentional. Then there’s the fact that one can practically tally the banal motifs — from the eerie little girl to the bloody bathroom scares to the inexplicable willingness of characters to split up.  It all culminates in a final ten minutes that drowns the film in every overdone cliché that the words “psychological thriller” might bring to mind.
It’s a shame, really, because there was tremendous potential here. Elizabeth Olsen, is, for the most part, phenomenal. She completely sells every ounce of her terror; her mouthed, soundless screams in particular cause almost physical discomfort to behold. The simple fact that she keeps it up for so long and manages to build the tension through her performance is commendable.  She gives it her all for a final product completely unworthy of her level of dedication.
And though it’s most certainly nothing more than a gimmick, here the technical proficiency of the film also deserves recognition simply for the deft camerawork necessary to pull off a movie like this at all, even with the possibility that many takes were actually stitched together to create the appearance of one seamless shot.
Yet it’s all for naught. Anyone hoping for a scary, satisfying little ride should look elsewhere; Silent House provides nothing more than a couple of jumps before invalidating itself completely in the last few minutes.

Lori Andrews, author of I Know Who You Are and I Saw What You Did: Social Networks and the Death of Privacy, spoke about social media’s effect on privacy and her proposed social media constitution Monday at the Geoffrey Cowan Forum in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Andrews, a professor and associate vice president at the Illinois Institute of Technology and director of the school’s Institute for Science, Law and Technology, outlined several ways social media collects information about users through their activities and information posted online.
“It’s hard to tell what happens to you when you join social networks,” Andrews said. “They’re constantly redefining the terms of service. We don’t really know what were getting into. That’s why I think it’s important to define the reach of social networks.”
Information collected by sites such as Facebook, Google and many popular smartphone applications is used for advertising and research, often without the knowledge of the user, Andrews said.
Andrews said employers, school officials, law enforcement and strangers are also increasingly viewing information on social networking profiles, despite any privacy measures a user has taken.
“We’re not being protected online the same way we are offline,” Andrews said. “So I decided we need a social network constitution.”
Andrews’ constitution includes liberties such as the right to connect to any social network without restriction, freedom of association in terms of joining groups or liking pages, freedom not to reveal these associations, freedom of expression and a right to privacy. This hypothetical constitution would also consider protecting current rights that might be infringed upon by social media.
Andrews said the Supreme Court has made rulings to prevent new technology from invading privacy in the past and “we can gain control if we pay attention.”
The White House has released a plan for an online privacy rights bill, but Andrews said many aspects of the bill would not be sufficient enough to protect citizens’ privacy.
The bill focuses on protecting personal data, such as names and addresses, but Andrews said other digital information, including Google search history, can provide important clues to an internet user’s identity.
April Luo, an undeclared freshman, said social networking poses a serious threat to her privacy rights.
“Our generation is definitely more desensitized to [sharing information online], but I personally don’t feel violated,” Luo said. “When you think about it, it is kind of creepy, but advertisers don’t really do much with your information except send you spam. Plus, you can always control to some extent what you put online.”

For the blog Opinionator’s “Anxiety” series, Jeffrey Lewis made this comic strip and accompanying essay, jointly titled, “A Song of Woe, Gone Viral.”
In each piece he tells the story of his song “Anxiety Attack,” which since its 2005 release grew from small potatoes to a minor viral phenomenon, receiving several music video interpretations, all by basement filmmakers totally unaffiliated with Jeffrey Lewis. Together these videos amassed tens of thousands of YouTube views.
For Lewis, the moral of this story is that people have identified with his message. In the comic strip he asks: “Is there something particular to being attacked by personal demons that brings people together?” And in his essay he says “Anxiety Attack” is proof that songwriters should focus more on everyday problems, like being “overweight and underpaid,” rather than the comfortable lifestyle enjoyed by most popular musicians.
Lewis’s argument is interesting, but he has perhaps misinterpreted his own success. While his feelings expressed in the song (e.g. “What if I wasted my whole life?” and “How come I get nothing done but always feel so busy?”) certainly represent the self-doubt that’s pandemic in our modern America, he cannot attribute the song’s entire popularity to relatable lyrics. It has a nice melody, too. Lewis asks whether there would be “a similar breakthrough if [he] wrote a song about diabetes, or erectile dysfunction”; and one might reply, “Sure—if it’s catchy enough.”
In fact, taking that counterargument further, we might even say that music is useful precisely because it draws us to ideas we might not otherwise consider. For example: the We Are the World Foundation made “We Are the World 25 for Haiti,” and thereby drew huge amounts of views (nearly 100 million as of this writing) to the 2010 Haitian earthquake relief efforts. For another example: So many classic songs are written about people to whom we almost definitely cannot relate. The Doors’ “The End” is about a man who kills his whole family and then has sex with his mother. We can relate to this deeply twisted Oedipal scenario because the frantic rhythmic drive pulls us into the protagonist’s mania.
Perhaps because we are a heavily text-oriented society, we tend to reduce music to its literary component, and think about little else when evaluating the meaning or value of a piece. But music is not poetry. When we talk about music, we have to talk about music. We have to think about why music in particular is such a useful medium.

USC will recognize former students of Japanese decent deprived of their degrees because of Executive Order 9066, which permitted the creation of Japanese internment camps in the United States during World War II, at commencement in May.
USC previously recognized the importance of commemorating Nisei, American-educated children of first-generation Japanese immigrants in 2008 when the Asian Pacific Alumni Association  awarded them honorary alumni status and they were recognized during a home football game, according to USC News.
Nisei · At 2012 commencement, USC will award honorary degrees to students whose studies were interrupted by Executive Order 9066. - Daily Trojan File Photo
The university will give Nisei students honorary degrees. There are fewer than 150 living Nisei alumni, and more than 20 of them plan to attend the ceremony.
“This is different than the typical person that would receive an honorary degree,” said Scott Mory, CEO of the Alumni Association. “These people are Trojans who were removed from their studies through no fault of their own because of an unjust and prejudiced law. This is not meant to create a precedent for future honorary degrees.”
Though the details of the process are still being discussed, the Nisei will be prominently featured during the commencement, Mory said.
The honoring of Nisei students exemplifies the way USC supports those who have attended the university, President C. L. Max Nikias said.
“Through the years these students have been among the most passionate and dedicated members of the Trojan Family,” Nikias told USC News. “We are honored that our Nisei students have an enduring devotion to USC, and we want them to know that the university is also devoted to them.”
Wow… it only took 50 years. Way to be a dick VonKleinsmid…

View Roundup 03-20 in a larger map
Crimes against a person
At 5:50 p.m. on March 18, a student said a male suspect on a bicycle slapped her buttocks as he rode past her while she was jogging near Jefferson Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. The suspect rode out of sight and could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
Crimes against property
At 5:20 p.m. on March 18, a suspect approached a non-USC male and asked for the time as he was crossing the street at entrance gate three. When the male pulled out his cellphone to check the time, the suspect attempted to grab it and a struggle ensued.  The suspect fled on foot without the phone, but he was subsequently detained by LAPD deputies who happened upon the scene. The suspect was arrested and transported to Southwest station for booking. 
At 5:10 p.m. on March 16, a suspect approached a student from behind and snatched her cellular phone from her hand while she was standing at a bus stop near Jefferson Boulevard and Vermont Avenue.  The suspect fled on foot and he could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
At 2:00 p.m. on March 16, a suspect entered an unsecured room  in the Allen Hancock Foundation and removed a laptop computer. The suspect was confronted by a student as he was leaving the room and placed the computer on a desk. The suspect then fled on foot and he could not be located during a subsequent search of the area by DPS officers.
Miscellaneous incidents
At 12:30 a.m. on March 19, DPS officers responded to a traffic collision near Pizza Hut involving two vehicles, both of which were driven by students.  LAPD officers were at the scene administering a field sobriety test to one of the students when the officers arrived and she was subsequently arrested. Neither student was injured.
At 6:16 p.m. on March 18, DPS officers detained a suspect at the Norris Dental Science Center who refused to comply after they advised him against trespassing on university property several times. He was arrested and transported to Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.
At 8:51 p.m. on March 16, DPS officers responded to a radiation alarm activation on the loading dock at the Keck Hospital.  A safety office staff member was there when the officers arrived and he determined that a biohazard bag in one of the trash bins he was emptying had activated the alarm. The staff member transported the bag to a containment room for proper disposal.
At 11:11 a.m. on March 16, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect prowling inside Harris Hall and detained him for investigation. The officers found the suspect in possession of a knife, then arrested and transported him to the Metropolitan Detention Center for booking.

Charles “Chuck” Patrick O’Regan, executive director of operations for Facilities Management Services, died on March 9. He was 62.
O’Regan oversaw approximately 320 employees in operations and maintenance for the University Park and Health Sciences campuses. His more than 36 years at USC began with a senior electrician position, and included leadership roles such as electric shop foreman, construction manager and associate director of Operations and Maintenance. As executive director of operations, O’Regan implemented a Zone Maintenance program and developed a Pay for Skills program to allow tradespeople and technicians to increase their salaries through training and skill assessments.
O’Regan was born in Park River, North Dakota, and studied electrical technology at Valley City State College in North Dakota. He served in the U.S. Army from 1969 to 1970, stationed in Korea, and then received an associate’s degree in electrical engineering from Long Beach City College. Before working for the university, he worked for the Long Beach City School District and local contracting firms in the Long Beach area.
O’Regan was also known for his love of golf and served as President of the Board at the Candlewood Country Club in Whittier.
Operations and Management Project Manager Greg Desario said his 18 years working with O’Regan involved frequent travel around the country, where the two often joked with each other.
“He always knew how to pack, and I didn’t understand how he could get all his clothes into one bag,” Desario said. “I used to joke with him about his clothes being little.”
Desario stressed O’Regan’s dedication to the university, even when he was stressed or tired.
Whenever O’Regan traveled, he had to change chain-of-command notification in case of an emergency at USC. When Desario and O’Regan went on a Thursday through Saturday trip to Las Vegas  because O’Regan wanted to recharge and relax, Desario found out O’Regan had told the university to resume his notification position as soon as he came back to Los Angeles late Saturday night. Desario  then asked O’Regan why he  didn’t wait until Monday.
“He said, ‘Greg, people find comfort in knowing that I am here,’” Desario said. “I never really understood how true that was until he was gone.”
Desario said there’s a somber mood in the FMS office without O’Regan and that he feels the absence.
“We would go and have dinner if we were staying late or had a function in the evening,” Desario said. “Before his memorial service, I was getting ready to pack up and grab some dinner so I looked over at his office door and wondered if he’s ready to go.”
Robert Cuthill, a zone supervisor, said it was an honor to work for O’Regan for 16 years.
“Anybody would be fortunate to have worked for Chuck. There aren’t a lot of people like him,” Cuthill said. “He never made you feel like he was your boss. You wanted to get things done because it was him.”
Cuthill said O’Regan was supportive of all his staff, and his effort to be a friend and a co-worker put him at ease.
“He got me through my divorce and when my house burned down,” Cuthill said. “I was a wreck and he stepped in and helped me through it.”
While Cuthill stressed the skill and dedication of all FMS management, he said O’Regan was the heart and soul of the department.
“In FMS, the managers and directors are great and you can see where it comes from,” Cuthill said. “You don’t have that without someone special like Chuck.”
He said O’Regan’s hard work inspired others to do their best, which helped everyone in the university.
“If something needed to be done, he’d step in and make sure it happened. Chuck was dedicated to this school and put his all into it,” Cuthill said. “That’s why everyone throughout the university loved him.”
Vilma Perez, his assistant, said O’Regan was like a big brother during the 15 years she worked with him.
“He was always there to listen to you, even if it was a small little story,” Perez said. “He was all ears all the time.”
She said his positive energy inspired her. When she asked him how he was doing, he would say, “I’m doing good with the joy of being here.”
At the end of the day, Perez said O’Regan made her laugh with the way he said goodbye: “Elvis is leaving the building.”
O’Regan is survived by his wife of 26 years, Melanie, his daughters Amy Salter, Janis Lake, Heather Wilson and Whitney, and his son, Ryan, as well as his eight grandchildren: Samantha, Madison, Laney, Travis, Charlie, Grant, Jack and Lucy. He was the youngest of three, survived by his brother James O’Regan of Owatanna, Minn., and his sister, Mary Wickes of Bismarck, N.D. FMS plans to hold a memorial service for the USC community in the near future.

Heather Hall, Thornton School of Music production manager, always dreamed of dancing in Disneyland parades, so while studying dance at UC Irvine, she decided to audition.
She was cast as a dancer in the Electrical Parade, and soon learned it was much harder than it looked.

“My first performance, I was so overwhelmed with excitement and joy,” Hall said. “But at the same time, I didn’t realize how hard it was going to be because the parade route is a lot longer than you think and it’s also really tiring. I was so excited, but I was dying at the same time.”
Hall had been a performer for most of her life before dancing at Disneyland. She said her parents enrolled her in her first dance class when she was four because she started to dance whenever she heard music. She also spent several years playing piano and clarinet.
“I started getting too busy, so I had to choose,” she said. “Do I want to focus more on dance, or do I want to do music? I chose dance, but I was still doing a lot of singing and choir, so music has always been a big part of my life.”
Hall left her San Diego home to study dance at UC Irvine. She spent her last two years in college dancing at Disneyland, but wanted a change when she graduated.
“When I graduated college, I think that’s when I realized I really enjoyed dancing, and it’s always something that will be a part of my life in some way, but I’m ready to be behind the scenes,” Hall said.
She continued working for Disney, but transitioned to behind-the-scenes production as a stage manager and administrator, working for the Guest Talent Program department, where she worked with community groups who came to the Disneyland park to perform.
“I’ve always been really intrigued with events and I had at one point thought that maybe I’d be an event planner,” Hall said. “I thought this would be a really good opportunity because it combined my arts background with dance as well as the event production. I didn’t really anticipate being there long, but I ended up having such a good time and learning so much.”
Eight years later, she still works for Disney on weekends, but, for about two years, has spent the week days in Thornton’s MacDonald, Ramo and Newman recital halls as production manager. She heard about the job from Director of Operations and Concerts Michelle Maestas, a friend from Disney, and applied partly because her fiance, who she met at UC Irvine, was working on his masters at USC.
“I was looking for a larger role than what I was doing at Disney,” Hall said. “Our department was so small that there wasn’t really a lot of opportunities to move around.”
Hall is now responsible for hiring and training student staff members, updating operating guidelines and managing Thornton productions from small student recitals to large events like the recent Piatigorsky International Cello Festival.
“There are a lot of events here and working with the students is awesome because I love training and sharing the knowledge that I have with other people,” Hall said. “My drawing point was definitely working with these kids and giving them advice before they graduate.”
Hall said she has been able to share lessons she learned from her experience with Disney with student workers to make events run as smoothly as possible.
“The ultimate thing I learned [at Disney] is to make the guest experience the best it can be,” Hall said. “What I try to instill in the students that work for me is that we’re going to make this the best and we want them to be happy, so we need to give them the best service we can. It’s not always going to be perfect, but that’s what we’re always going to strive for, so we’re going to do our very best.”
Hall said spring is the busiest season for Thornton performances, with numerous recitals and other large events. Though summer provides a break from the many performances, Hall is not entirely taking a break from events. She is currently planning her wedding, set for August.
GREAT ARTICLE ON A WONDERFUL WOMAN I AM VERY PROUD TO CALL MY DAUGHTER. SHE NEVER STOPS AMAZING ME. SHE WAS THE PERFECT FIT FOR THIS POSITION, ALWAYS POSITIVE, UPBEAT AND LOVES WORKING WITH EVERYONE SHE COMES IN CONTACT WITH. USC IS VERY LUCKY TO HAVE SOMEONE WITH ALL HER TALENTS AND EXPERIENCES WORKING FOR THEM. AND SHE IS VERY APPRECIATIVE OF USC GIVING HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING ALL OF THEM TO THIS  POSITION.

Experts in education discussed the underlying problems facing K-12 education around the country and how students could get involved with solving them to kick off Program Board’s Education Month on Monday in Bovard Auditorium.
Organizers hope EdMonth, a two-weeklong event series, will make students more aware of educational disparities and spark similar events at other universities.

Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa delivered opening remarks. He said students in Los Angeles K-12 public schools face an array of problems that could be solved by increasing accountability  of teachers, raising the standards for teaching credentials and increasing wages.
“If we want to compete in the world, we have to have the best public schools in the world,” Villaraigosa said. “If we want to compete in the world, we have to have the highest standards for our teachers.”
The panelists said underperforming teachers have created underperforming students and decreasing graduation rates, which led to the U.S. falling behind other leading countries of the world in terms of education.
“Other countries have gotten this, they do whatever they can to get the best teachers into schools for everyone and that makes a difference,” said Karen Gallagher, dean of the Rossier School of Education. “We don’t do that, and that is one of the things that we can control.”
Wendy Kopp, CEO and founder of Teach for America, stressed that there is no perfect model for a school, but improving education requires administrators who can get parents, students and teachers to work together.
“There is no magic,” Kopp said. “This is about a leader and a team that embrace a mission.”
Gallagher said this concept can be applied in different ways. USC Hybrid High, a charter school for chronically truant students scheduled to open in fall, will have teachers working 40 hours a week, but not at traditional hours, allowing students to attend school while working or caring for family members.
“We want to bring in parents,” Gallagher said. “We want to bring in community members.”
The panelists stressed that USC students can help without pursuing a career in education by mentoring younger students or getting involved with the Joint Educational Partnership.
Eddie Souler, a freshman majoring in civil engineering, said the call to action made the event unique for him.
“Everyone was really into the whole reform idea,” Souler said. “Not just giving us information but pushing toward things.”
Markus Mar-Liu, a freshman majoring in astronautical engineering, said the panel could have included more information about fixing systemic problems in education.
“It had a really good selection of people with great experiences,” Mar-Liu said. “It would’ve been better if they talked about the solution more than the problem.”
Latino/a Student Assembly Executive Director Steven Almazan, one of the event organizers, said he hoped the panel helped “offer insight into how students right now can make a difference.”
Moderator David Belasco, a professor of business, said the panel of education experts addressed an important issue.
“Education reform is probably the largest issue of our time,” Belasco said. “It’s fundamentally unfair. It shouldn’t matter who your parents are or where you were born, everyone should have a shot at education.”
Los Angeles Unified School District Board President Mónica García said education must be equal for people to find success.
“We know education changes lives. We know education is the great equalizer,” García said. “It is not okay for the U.S. to be 16th in graduation rates.”
Marshall Tuck, CEO of the Partnership for Los Angeles Schools, Villaraigosa’s initiative to help underperforming schools, said the city’s education disparity demonstrates the effect of inequality.
“If you are born in a certain part of Los Angeles, you have a huge mountain to climb,” Tuck said.
Some students said the panelists broke down a complex issue.
“The panel really got to touch on various issues,” said Ruth Le, a junior majoring in public policy, managing and planning. “[The organizers] brought together a lot of dynamic people who had a lot to say.”
