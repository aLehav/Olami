The following incidents were reported in the USC Dept. of Public Safety incident report summary between Friday, Oct. 5, and Saturday, Oct. 6. 
Crimes against a person
At 10:01  P.M. on Oct. 5, DPS officers on routine patrol near the intersection of 36th Place and Normandie Avenue observed a non-USC female who appeared to be fleeing from something. When they contacted her she stated that someone had attempted to shoot her with a pellet gun. The female stated that she was not injured and walked away after declining to file a police report.
at 2:46 P.M. on Oct. 5, a student reported receiving numerous annoying and sexually suggestive text messages and phone calls from a former student after she asked him not to contact her. She told officers it has caused her to fear for her safety.
 
Crimes against property
at 7:58 P.M. on Oct. 6, DPS officers on routine patrol observed a suspect holding a can of spray paint running from 37th Place and Normandie Avenue and detained him for investigation. The officers located a wall that the suspect admitted to tagging. The suspect was subsequently arrested by LAPD officers who responded to the scene.
 
Miscellaneous incidents
At 1:00 p.M. on Oct. 6, a nurse at the Keck Hospital of USC reported that a patient threatened her when she refused to provide him with the prescription medication he requested.
At 1:50 A.M. on Oct. 6, DPS officers responded to a report of a suspect prowling inside Troy Hall and detained him for investigation. The suspect was found in possession of a knife and a check of his name revealed two outstanding warrants. The suspect was then arrested and transported to MDC for booking.
Great job DPS!  I feel much better knowing you are always checking our buildings!
Dena,
Why are you attacking me?  I am trying to protect you from the Row and bad things that go on there.  The Row is the worst place a woman can go around SC.  They are having unprotected sex up and down the Row and that is keeping us out of good bowl game!
Gabriel, there is absolutely no connection with the BCS to neither the Row nor the Greek system. The Greek system will never cease to exist here. Stop trolling.
Dena,
Someone has duplicated the screen name Gabriel in an attempt to discredit the actual Gabriel’s concerns with the greek system at USC lagging the rapid rise in social sophistication of more recently admitted students, rise in academic standing of recently admitted students and USC rise in stature among universities. Instead of some self-evaluation, the only (unofficial) response from Greeks has been this transparent attempt to assume another’s  online identity and offer anti-gay, unprotected and unsafe sex glorification in recent posts, and now this absurd BCS comment. Ironically, the Greek supporting imposter is merely overwhelming illustrating my (the authentic Gabriel’s) concern.
The real Gabriel never speaks of himself in the third person.  I have no idea who the quack is that keeps attacking the Row and the BCS system.   Further, my sexual practices should not be discussed on the DT website.
Dena,
Let me apologize as I’m the real Gabriel.  There are at least two fake Gabriels posting to the DT.  Anything they have said about SC’s rankings among the nation’s top universities, the row or the BCS should be ignored.
Obviously the problem here is the Row and Greek system which needs to be shut down if we are ever going to be in a BSC Bowl game.

The Keck School of Medicine, Ostrow School of Dentistry and Rossier School of Education have each announced new online degree programs for graduate students.
Keck will offer a master of public health degree, Ostrow will offer an online master of science in geriatric dentistry degree and Rossier will offer a master of education in school leadership degree.
The programs at the Keck and Rossier schools will be open to students next semester, while Ostrow will begin its new program next fall.
While USC is no stranger to online education, the revolutionary aspect of these programs is its intended target audience.
“The program is designed for working professionals,” said Alex Duke, assistant dean of enrollment management and student services at the Rossier School of Education.
By offering working professionals the opportunity to continue their education, Rossier sets them up to become strong and active in their field, according to Duke.
Roseann Mulligan, program director and chair of the division of dental public health and pediatric dentistry at Ostrow, said the school also intends to gear the geriatric dentistry program toward professionals.
“It will focus on the most common medical and oral health conditions seen in older adults,” Mulligan said.
Despite the fact that the programs are online education only, they will still allow students to connect with their classmates by creating a network of professional students across the country.
“Having classmates that you interact with and learn from is just part of the experience,” Duke said. “It creates the ability for our students to have a national community of practice.”
Kelly Goulis, senior associate dean of graduate and professional programs at the Viterbi School of Engineering, pointed out that these programs also have practical implications for students.
“It’s a matter of just expanding our reach to get to students who are not able to get here full time on campus,” Goulis said.
Despite the three new programs for graduate students, the university does not have plans to create online opportunities for undergraduates. Goulis said this is because of the nature of the college experience.
“When you’re an undergraduate living on campus, being here and interacting with other students, it provides you with … things that are important as you’re growing and developing into the next stage of your academic career,” Goulis said.
Regardless of the success of the three programs, Duke said the experience will be valuable.
“You learn something in the creation of every program,” Duke said.
And these opportunities, successful or not, could be the first of many programs that allow working professionals to continue receiving an education while climbing the corporate ladder.

Barry Shank, professor of American studies, cultural theory and popular music at the Department of Comparative Studies at the Ohio State University, discussed culture in music at a seminar Monday hosted by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
Listening · Professor Barry Shank of the Ohio State University speaks at a seminar Monday about his research into cultural meaning and interpretation of popular music. – Priyanka Patel | Daily Trojan
His presentation “From Sentimental to Interrogative Listening: Clining in the Aural Imaginary” focused on what is called the “aural imaginary” by ethnic studies expert Roshanak Kheshti: “where experiences of musical pleasure are inescapably structured by relations of dominance.”
Shank received a Ph.D. in American Studies from the University of Pennsylvania and currently studies the “political agency of music, commercial popular culture and cultural history,” according to his biography on the Ohio State website.
Shank is currently working on a project called “Silence, Noise, Beauty: The Political Agency of Music,” which was presented at the lecture.
Shank explained the idea that it is impossible for human beings to listen to sounds from various cultures and experience meaning in the same way.
“If we only listen to music we already know, that music does nothing but reaffirm our already existing sense of the world and our already existing sense of what we believe,” Shank said.
One band of a specific culture that Shank referred to is Tinariwen, whose members originate from the Sahara Desert area of northern Mali. The members of the band met in refugee camps in Libya and many participated as rebel fighters in Mali. Their music sends a strong message about the suffrage of the Tuareg people and other suppressed groups using an instrument familiar to Western listeners: a guitar.
Shank said that the melodies of Tinariwen “stage an exchange of articulate voices,” and that the presence of the band’s music all over the world shows the use of a familiar medium to convey a message foreign to many.
“What’s sought isn’t your affection, but your respect,” Shank said of the music of other communities around the world. He noted that listeners are often unable to empathize with the messages of people of vastly different cultures, but can still feel the music and note the sense of beauty in the work.
Many students who attended the seminar were not familiar with the subject at hand, but were enticed by the implications of Shank’s work.
Robert Sarkesium, a first-year Ph.D. student in Annenberg, said he enjoyed Shank’s presentation even though he did not have much experience with the topic.
“I am very happy that this work is being done [with] the focus on different cultures and music and different kinds of media,” Sarkesium said.

This week, the USC community plans to support the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population on campus by observing National Coming Out Week, which includes National Coming Out Day on Thursday.
National Coming Out Day was founded in 1988 by psychologist Robert Eichberg and Jean O’Leary, then the head of the National Gay Rights Advocates. Because the National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights was held on Oct. 11 the preceding year, the 11th was chosen as a day to raise awareness for, and celebrate,  LGBT communities.
The celebration was initially a single civil awareness day, but has now grown to include the entire week. In some places, such as at USC, the full month of October is celebrated as LGBT Heritage Month.
The USC LGBT Resource Center offers various events, assemblies and speakers for students to learn more about the LGBT community throughout October. The events will highlight the history of the community while providing a safe campus environment for anyone who is struggling with their sexuality.
“At any university, it’s significant and important for people to be able to be expressive of who they are,” said Karen Tongson, associate professor of English and gender studies. “To explicitly make a gesture toward acceptance, visibility and pride is an important thing.”
Tongson said it is not the act of coming out, but the creation of a welcoming environment, that is important during National Coming Out Week.
“Not everyone feels it’s necessary to come out or make a statement of coming out,” she said. “I think it’s important to create a nurturing environment for those that feel it’s important to come out, but also to be respectful of people who don’t want to participate in labeling whatever is important to them and who they love and how they feel.”
In addition to helping people feel more acceptance, the week will draw attention to the political struggles of LGBT individuals. According to Professor Larry Gross, an expert in LGBT studies and politics, National Coming Out Week will serve to attract attention to LGBT individuals’ lack of rights.
“The point of this event is to bring attention to an often invisible minority by identifying oneself as LGBT, often to folks who wouldn’t otherwise have known this,” Gross said. “Despite enormous changes in the situation of LGBT people in this country, we remain a readily available political target and this is due in part to general lack of visibility. Also, the lack of basic civil rights suffered by gay people … is due in part to pervasive invisibility. ‘Coming out’ has long been a central tactic of LGBT liberation for this reason.”
USC’s Queer and Ally Student Assembly will decorate Trousdale Parkway and other busy walkways with colored banners to symbolize acceptance and respect for USC’s LGBT community. Jaime Westendarp, a sophomore majoring in business of cinematic arts, is supportive of the display.
“As an ally of the LGBT community myself, it’s really refreshing to see that our school is such a supportive and accepting community,” Westendarp said. “It’s just a nice reminder that people care.”
Other students, though not personally involved in the LGBT cause, feel that having a national day to celebrate the LGBT community is important.
“Designated days show what’s important in a society,” said Lila Scott, a senior majoring in film  production. “Although it’s been a somewhat tumultous time in society for gay people, it’s great that there is a day set aside for celebrating their identity.”
Coming out week events include seminars and speaker series, including Models of Pride, an all-day youth conference sponsored by the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center’s LifeWorks Mentoring. QuASA will take an active role in the week’s events, sponsoring the Empowerment Series, which consists of four seminars for each segment of the LGBT community.
This year, social media will play a crucial role in the promotion of respect and acceptance of LGBT individuals. The LGBT Resource Center has formed the Ally Project, which asks people to do something very simple — update their profile pictures on Facebook to demonstrate acceptance. Participants will take pictures of themselves holding a sign reading, “I am an ally,” and display it as their Facebook profile picture.
Vincent Vigil, the director of the LGBT Student Resource Center, stresses how such a simple action truly can make a difference in someone’s struggle to accept their sexuality.
“Little things like this can go a long way,” Vigil said. “Imagine if you have 800 Facebook friends, and one of those friends is struggling with their sexuality or questioning themselves. They might feel like they’ll be able to talk to the person who put that picture up, and then they won’t feel so alone.”

I am not sure if this well help SC get a championship but I come out if someone can promise me we will win!

Ironically, the Greek supporting Gabriel imposter is merely overwhelming illustrating my (the authentic Gabriel’s) concerns.
NOT  in favor.. this whole coming out thing has destroyed my family”s life. our child is not welcome in our gatherings anymore.  I do NOT aprove of it..
I’m hoping that these events will help foster an atmosphere of acceptance for your child then, so maybe they don’t feel so alone in the world. It’s extremely hard to survive when you feel like an outcast, particularly from those you love most and from those who should love you most as well. Sending prayers of love and respect to you, your family, and your child.

The number of burglaries at USC’s University Park Campus increased by almost 30 percent in 2011, while robberies have nearly tripled from 2010, according to the federally mandated Annual Security and Fire Safety Report, released by the university last week.
Crime · Dept. of Public Safety officers monitor the University Park campus as part of the department’s overall effort to eliminate crime. DPS also stresses student awareness of dangerous situations as a key part of safety. – Caitlin Ito | Daily Trojan
Aside from the jump in robbery, burglary and weapon law referrals, crime on campus remained relatively stable and non-violent. Uncommon violations, such as arson and hate crimes, remained relatively consistent with previous years’ statistics, and murder, negligent manslaughter and non-forcible sex offenses were nonexistent.
Drug and liquor offenses even decreased significantly from 2010.
Statistics from 2012 have not yet been made available.
Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle attributes the decrease in drug and liquor violations to an increase in shared responsibility between students and DPS officers, particularly on The Row.
“We have worked closely with the [Inter-Fraternity Council] in an effort to encourage responsible behavior on The Row,” Carlisle said in an email. “The fraternity leaders have been very cooperative in taking a position of responsibility including managing risk. We prefer that fraternities ‘police’ themselves and control irresponsible behavior such as toxic or underage drinking.”
The increase in self-policing among students seems to be working: Liquor law referrals decreased from 509 instances in 2010 to 293 in 2011 — a 42 percent drop — and drug law referrals slowed by about 32 percent, from 223 in 2010 to 152 in 2011.
Jordan Klein, a freshman majoring in computer science (games), approved of the relative passivity of DPS on The Row.
“On The Row, DPS only intervenes if they see someone [who] clearly needs help or is in bad condition,” Klein said. “They are less worried about the mass culture of drinking than they are about safety, and that’s good.”
But a much larger concern for students is theft. One hundred and forty eight robberies and burglaries occurred at USC in 2011, up from 99 in 2010. According to Carlisle, many burglaries are committed at bus stations around the perimeter of campus by burglars looking to take advantage of unsuspecting students.
 
Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson said he is all too familiar with this problem.
“Criminals look for vulnerabilities and try to take advantage of them,” Jackson said. “They know that when school is in session, we have lots of people in the USC communities with expensive technology.”
Carlisle said the solution to the university’s theft problem is  common sense.
“Many of these thefts could have easily been prevented had students simply locked their doors,” Carlisle said.
Daniel Kim, a sophomore majoring in psychology, agreed with Carlisle.
“As students, we should be held responsible. Always be vigilant, always be alert, close the door when away. You just have to be careful, be smart about it,” Kim said.
Jackson shared the sentiment, adding that in residence halls, “students need to stop letting strangers tailgate them and come in the door. When we let strangers and non-students into our residence halls, that creates vulnerability.”
Carlisle stressed teamwork as another component of safety, and said he believes that the shared responsibility that often works on The Row can also apply to the larger community.
“We need all the members of the Trojan Family to work together to prevent crime,” Carlisle said. “A simple precaution such as locking your door whenever you are away, even if just for a moment, is important.”
Overall, however, Carlisle said DPS still has goals to reduce crime even more in upcoming years.
“We have made significant strides in crime reduction with substantial declines for several consecutive years,” Carlisle said. “An upturn was likely inevitable, but we will continue to analyze crime trends and develop strategies to address them.”

This weekend, The Wombats headlined Los Angeles’ 2012 Culture Collide Festival, regaling audiences with their alt-pop stylings and boyish charm.
Though some might not recognize the British group, the band’s unusual name is sure to draw some attention.
Band of bangs · Alt-pop trio The Wombats met at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts. Today, they travel across the States spreading a sound that is as influenced by Michael Jackson as it is Foo Fighters. – | Photo courtesy of Independent Label Group
One winter during music school, lead singer Matthew Murphy’s uncle invited him and drummer Dan Haggis on a trip to Australia.
“That’s when we were first introduced to the marsupial wombat,” Murphy explains.
“And it stuck with us,” adds Haggis. “We’ve since held many wombats.”
Bassist Tord Øverland-Knudsen interjects, “It’s also a military term. WOMBAT means ‘Waste of Money, Brains and Time.’ It sums us up very well.”
“Yes,” Murphy says, “but not our music.”
No, The Wombats’ operation is certainly not a WOMBAT, but this trio of Liverpool and Norway natives is decidedly hard to quantify. Friends for years, the band’s members spent their time watching cheesy Sylvester Stallone flicks on the bus, parsing idiomatic expressions like “tidbit” and finishing each other’s sentences.
They met while studying music at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, the university founded by Sir Paul McCartney in 1996.
“We were studying [at LIPA] because we didn’t know what we wanted to do with our lives,” Haggis says. “Apart from that, music was a lot of fun and got us through hangovers.”
The Wombats’ instant chemistry is clearly visible in the band’s live performances. The trio just wrapped a six-week tour as headliners for the Culture Collide festival in Echo Park, where the band’s members regaled audiences with their onstage charisma and tangible camaraderie. For The Wombats, this sense of musical unity results from years of jamming together.
“First time I met Tord was in the practice room,” Haggis says. “We were all kind of doing different things and studying, obviously, so [the band] was on the backburner. … After a couple years, we just started playing shows, loved it and never stopped.”
In their work, The Wombats are the opposite of dogmatic and refrain from self-consciousness. It would be easy to write off their tunes as bouncy “tidbits” but that relies on the assumption that up-tempo tunes are automatically trite, while downbeat ballads are deep and transcendent.
The Wombats establish complexity by juxtaposing danceable tracks with substantial, often harrowingly dark lyrics, resulting in a kind of ecstatic paranoia indicative of a precocious teenager unwilling to grow up. Lyrically, the trio’s curiosity, wit and calculated commentary result in a brand of casual, youthful genius previously achieved by the likes of California’s Pavement or, perhaps more relevantly, East London’s The Libertines.
But their sound is certainly not derivative. Though their music follows in the vein of fellow Brit bands The Fratellis, The Arctic Monkeys and Bloc Party, The Wombats achieve a unique, ever-adapting sound.
“We all listen to such different music and have grown up with lots of different stuff that I don’t think as a band [we would ever try to replicate someone else’s sound],” Haggis says. “I try not to listen to anything really before we go into practice. [My] head’s a bit clearer and [I] can approach things fresh.”
Of course, even the least hardcore punks have always claimed a “year zero” of music, grandly wiping their slate of influences clean. Such musicians play for an idea of the future, with a clear idea of where they’re going and what they’re leaving behind. This is how music evolves, grows — and inevitably, borrows.
Murphy cites influences everywhere from Michael Jackson to The Beatles, Foo Fighters to New Order, although he tries to distance himself from those artists and avoids self-conscious, retrospective analysis of his group’s sound. He asserts that his band’s music developed organically with the defection of its original fourth member. Without a second guitarist, the remaining three had to find a new way to channel that sound.
“Any new songs we were working on we started throwing some more harmonies on and that shaped things from there, organically. We just do whatever we feel we need to at the time, you know, whatever keeps us interested in what we’re doing,” says Haggis.
The Wombats are becoming more and more interesting to audiences in the States.
“We’re kind of a new band still,” says Tord. “We’ve done a few radio festivals on this tour and most people in the front are waiting to see the main band. … You kind of have to win them over, and it’s kind of fun, but weird to start with. You’re just giving and giving and you get nothing back. If you get them to nod their head a bit, then that’s rewarding.”
The Wombats see America as an opportunity and a challenge to focus on the music.
“We obviously like doing, back in the U.K., bigger shows with production and lasers and stuff like that, and over here obviously it’s smaller and more intimate, so we just go back to our punk ethics,” Haggis says.
That’s the always-positive attitude of the touring band. These Internet-age grandsons of British punk seem to be reasserting what The Jam in 1977 called “a young idea” in their song “In The City,” which urges listeners to reject negativity and oppression in favor of embracing freedom, ecstasy and optimism. If you plan, for whatever reason, to throw The Wombats in the bin, take that idea to heart: “You’d better listen man / Because the kids know where it’s at.”

It’s not every day that a 35-foot-tall structure goes up in the middle of an outdoor public space. But until next month, Pasadena residents strolling through One Colorado Courtyard will encounter just that.
The aluminum skeleton of a building on display looks as if construction workers left a project abandoned and incomplete, but the structure actually serves as a very deliberate work of art.
Great outdoors · At One Colorado Courtyard in Pasadena, passersby can catch a glimpse of Chris Burden’s skeletal structure “Small Skyscraper,” a temporary installment built to the exact limits Los Angeles County will allow with no permit. The work arrives in California after time in Switzerland. – | Photo courtesy of Chris Burden and Gagosian Gallery
“Small Skyscraper” is artist Chris Burden’s way of looking at building construction and city rules. The structure explores the ways in which we expand our space and the obstacles we might run into in doing so.
Back in 1994, Burden discovered that though Los Angeles County rules call for a permit for each structure built, anyone could get away with not having said permit if the structure was no more than 400 square feet and 35 feet high. In 2003, Burden’s structure came to life through a collaboration with Linda Taalman and Alan Koch of Taalman Koch Architecture. It was exhibited at LACE gallery, where it lay horizontally on the floor, then in Switzerland where it stood vertically, as it does now.
The public space setting differentiates the work from what one might find in a sculpture garden of a museum. For every excited Burden admirer, there exists one disapproving casual passerby.
Not to mention, the public can be ruthless when it disapproves of a work of art — particularly one that invades their living or work space.
Take, for example, the famous case of Richard Serra’s “Tilted Arc.” The 120-foot-long, 12-foot-high structure stood in all its steel glory in the middle of Federal Plaza in New York City. The more days that passed, the more the controversy the piece began to stir up. This seemingly harmless art piece eventually got everyone so riled up a public hearing took place. It was decided the sculpture would leave the space.
That happened in 1981, and although the general public has surely seen much more controversial, in-your-face structures since, the erection of “Small Skyscraper” helps remind viewers of the dynamic between art and the public space. Even when the artwork seems totally undisruptive, there’s a certain kind of power in placing a work right smack in the middle of a place where people spend their everyday lives.
“Tilted Arc,” just like “Small Skyscraper,” did not display any sort of garish decoration or even words; it stood as a silent structure, yet garnered negative attention.  Similarly, “Small Skyscraper” will also irk some, likely because of its unfinished appearance.
But looking beyond the aesthetic — though the work is particularly fascinating in such an intimate plaza — “Small Skyscraper” comments on a loophole that reflects how complicated our spaces have become. As more dwellings sprout up, more regulations come into play. Burden pokes fun at the idea that the building could break free of some city rules.
When L.A. Weekly spoke to Burden in 2003, he described the work as something “two guys with a donkey could put up, and when the neighbor calls the building inspector, the guys can take it down again.”
That idea makes the building seem even more humorous. In its towering verticality, “Small Skyscraper” might show the same imposing authority of the other full-fledged buildings in the plaza, but at the end of its temporary stay it will — quite easily — come down. That fact also reminds us that although we put much importance into the structures in which we live and work, their foundations are startlingly simple.
The temporary stay of “Small Skyscraper” (The structure first went on display Aug. 11 and will remain in One Colorado Courtyard until Nov.11.)  also coincides with ArtNight Pasadena, which serves as good timing to remind art lovers and artists of one very important fact: Although we enjoy seeing art on the white walls of galleries, outdoor installations can often provide an equally effective, if not an greater, means of communicating an artist’s message.
Ultimately, Burden’s work serves as a way to slow down the public’s routines. When viewers gaze up at the work, they might find themselves wondering more than they ever thought they would about a simple, small skyscraper.
 
“Small Skyscraper” is on view in the One Colorado Courtyard until Nov. 11. One Colorado Courtyard is located on 41 Hugus Alley in Pasadena, CA 91103. A reception will take place Friday, Oct. 12 at 6 p.m. during ArtNight Pasadena.

USC’s Musical Theatre Repertory created a high-energy, giggle-inducing, jaw-dropping delight in its production of Little Shop of Horrors this past weekend.
The musical is based on a 1960 B-movie of the same title, notable for a cameo by a young and then unknown, Jack Nicholson. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman (the musical dream-team behind Disney’s Aladdin and The Little Mermaid, among many more) adapted the film for the stage, and the show premiered off-Broadway in 1982. Menken and Ashman’s version was subsequently made into another film in 1986, directed by Frank Oz and starring Rick Moranis and Steve Martin.
The story centers around Seymour, who works in a dilapidated flower shop on Skid Row in Los Angeles and spends his free time experimenting with cross-pollination of exotic plants. One of his projects, dubbed Audrey II after his voluptuous coworker and hopeless crush, struggles to grow until Seymour inadvertently feeds it a drop of his own blood. The plant, which looks like an eerily vibrant Venus Flytrap with monster teeth, grows insanely fast — but only on a diet of human blood. Audrey II becomes so large and impressive that it sparks a resurgence of success in the flower shop and even gains national attention, causing Seymour to resort to murder as a way to ensure that the plant and his own fame continue to grow.
With whip-smart lines, witty lyrics and fun, doo-wop style music, Little Shop of Horrors is pretty much fail-proof, even if a little bizarre. Combine that with a marvelous cast and creative team, and you’ve got a hit on your hands — as the musical demonstrates.
Patrick Reilly, who stars as Seymour, anchors the show with a brilliant performance. His portrayal of a tormented, downtrodden nerd oozes extremely earnest, good-guy, Harry Potter-esque charm. Reilly’s singing stands out as well, particularly in his heartwarming solo, “Grow for Me,” as his chemistry with other actors remains palpable. There wasn’t a moment in the show that he didn’t fill — he held the audience’s attention with his wide-eyed expressions and a twitchy, anxious quality to every movement.
Only the combined effervescence of Elizabeth Adabale, Jade Johnson and Charlotte Wen rival Reilly’s star power. The three spunky, “divalicious” women repeatedly brought down the house as a streetwise spin on a traditional Greek chorus, The Urchins. These ladies deserve a record deal — their vocal riffing prompted countless hollers from the audience. In addition, The Urchins’ every move was well synchronized, making them a pleasure to watch. But this came as no surprise. Wen also served as the show’s choreographer, giving the ladies upbeat and spicy moves to work with.
A. J. Helfet, who earned many laughs as Seymour’s boss and the owner of the flower shop, Mr. Mushnik, also impressed audiences. Helfet’s physical prowess appeared in every bumbling step he took — particularly while dancing. His line delivery remained consistently funny (even if it did pander to Jewish stereotypes a bit). His number with Seymour, “Mushnik and Son,” really allowed both actors to flaunt their training — they sang, danced and slapsticked like pros.
Sarah May Scotti took an unconventional approach in her interpretation of Audrey, downplaying the character’s brassy, coquettish characteristics and instead electing to highlight the vulnerability of a single woman living in a nasty part of town. Scotti’s alternation between wide smile and furrowed brow allowed Seymour’s desperation to take her far from Skid Row to shine through in the scenes the two shared. Further, her pure singing voice made her rendition of “Somewhere That’s Green” incredibly bittersweet.
David Mandell played Orin, Audrey’s lowlife boyfriend and a sadistic dentist with an addiction to laughing gas. Mandell’s insane cackle, fierce eyes and booming voice made for an outlandish and terrifying villain. His songs were highly entertaining, although the huge laughing gas apparatus that he wore for his last song muffled many of his lines.
Segun Oluwadele lent his voice to Audrey II (Oh yeah, the plant talks — and sings). Every smooth utterance garnered wild applause from the audience, and for good reason — this man is talented. Much like the ladies of The Urchins, Oluwadele performed vocal acrobatics with grace and pizzazz. His numbers electrified, prompting a did-he-really-just-hit-that-note sense of reverence from audience members. If only Audrey II could sing in every song.
Oluwadele’s voice, however, wasn’t the only impressive aspect of Audrey II. In Little Shop of Horrors, Audrey II spreads and grows to enormous heights as he consumes his victims, requiring top-notch creativity and skill from the technical team. USC’s production rose to the challenge: working magic onstage with well-designed ever-growing puppets, the portrayal of the carnivorous plant was nothing short of amazing.
But the production shone in other aspects, as well. In fact, the success of this cohesive production relied heavily on the orchestra. The musicians, particularly the percussionists and reeds, infused the show with the sort of energy that only comes from bombastic live music. The show felt like it had a human pulse — even an awkward bit of blocking went mostly undetected since it was underscored by flawless-sounding music. With such a lively score, thank goodness the creative team didn’t elect to use a canned soundtrack.
In addition, the costumes were wonderful (particularly Audrey’s wardrobe full of hot pink and animal prints) and the lighting effectively enhanced the mood of each scene. The set, complete with broken crates and graffiti, evoked a truly grim Skid Row, drawing audiences into the grim but hilarious world of Seymour and Audrey.
Considering just how good the show was, it would come as no surprise if audience members couldn’t stop hearing Oluwadele’s voice softly growling “feed me” as they returned home.

Every year at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, one culinary artist continues a tradition that’s been upheld for more than a century. This master of dairy sculptures carves what has famously been titled the “Butter Cow,” a 600-pound statue made entirely of butter and an interior wooden-metal framework. Uniquely created dairy sculptures — most notably John Wayne, Harry Potter and Elvis Presley — usually accompany the cow at every fair.
Butter buggy · Jennifer Garner carves up an automobile sculpture as Laura Pickler in her latest film Butter. This marks the first time the actress has produced a film under her production company Vandalia Films. – | Photo courtesy of Radius Films
Young screenwriter Jason Micallef discovered the incredibly intense and competitive world of butter carvings on a summer road trip with several college classmates. Upon observing the dedication and passion behind each piece of butter artwork, Micallef thought these contests made the perfect topic for a feature film. After employing some creative freedom and adding his own fictional twist, the screenplay for Butter was born.
Butter follows the story of Laura Pickler (Jennifer Garner), the wife of butter sculpting icon Bob Pickler (Ty Burrell). After her husband’s sudden retirement from competition, Laura enters a butter sculpting contest to preserve the Pickler name. Assuming she would move unmatched to the State Fair showcase, Pickler is surprised to find an eclectic group of opponents in her way.
These competitors include 10-year-old Destiny (played by film newcomer Yara Shahidi), Bob’s free-spirited mistress Brooke (Olivia Wilde) and butter sculpture super-fan Carol-Ann (Kristen Schaal).  From here, Butter becomes a tale of “politics, ambition, greed, sex, race and family,” as described by Laura in the film’s opening scene.
Micallef’s script was immediately met with praise and intrigue from filmmakers and studio executives for its unique concept. Michael De Luca, the Oscar-nominated producer of films such as Moneyball and The Social Network, and his partner Alissa Phillips quickly optioned Butter for production.  By the end of 2008 Butter was included on Leonard Franklin’s “Black List” as the third best un-produced screenplay of the year.
Once financed, Butter drew the attention of actress Jennifer Garner for the leading role of Laura Pickler. Garner thought so highly of the script that she not only starred, but also produced Butter as the first film from her upstart production company, Vandalia Films. After securing Garner as the protagonist, De Luca then tapped Jim Field Smith for the director’s chair and signed an all star comedic cast for supporting roles.
All this considered, it’s no wonder that audiences might expect a bit more from the final version. Though the film shines in terms of characterization and visual design, Butter fails to live up to its potential.
The audience can almost immediately identify the political notions of Butter through the character of Laura, who speaks in a tone of superiority. Laura’s voiceover monologues almost speak down to the viewer, indicating how little she thinks of others and how highly she sees herself. Laura’s style of dress similarly invokes the wardrobe of a politician’s wife. Fitted with pearl necklaces, ironed sundresses and disturbingly pristine hair, Laura looks as though she belongs on campaign bus rather than in a butter carving cooler.
Still, the powerful character depictions, through means not traditionally utilized in comedies for player development, are one of the strengths of Micallef’s script and of the costume designer, Susie DeSanto. DeSanto and Micallef cooperatively develop and form the unique personae of each character through appropriate visual details such as wallpapered floral patterns on Pickler’s  starched-stiff dress suits and pastel-colored cardigans buttoned up to her chin. In this way, audiences can understand  a character’s personality just by looking at their costumes onscreen and remain interested in the film as they take in visual and literary character clues for the entire run time.
Many of the laughs found in Butter — and there is much hilarity in this film — come from the exaggerated parodic characters Micallef has imagined. Since Butter falls into the category of dark satire-comedy, the audience laughs not at the humor of the situation, but at how disturbing and crude the actions of the characters are. Some of Pickler’s lines in this movie when describing different types of people are scarily funny, simply because they are extreme examples of actual prejudices people have today.
Where this film falters and ultimately fails is in the strange construction of the plot and a hugely missed opportunity to satirize the poor state of American politics. Micallef begins this film quite well; he strongly establishes the characters and entertains the audiences with good comedy.  As the film progresses, however, the humor weakens and the plot becomes repetitive in some places and just plain strange in others.
It seems as though Micallef initially had a good concept behind the movie and compelling characters to surround it, but perhaps didn’t fully conceptualize where the film would go from there. As a result, the themes of the film are less than effective. The notion of political satire is only minimally touched upon, which greatly underwhelms. Some viewers might interpret Laura Pickler as a critique of the Republican political personage, but Micallef doesn’t analyze her deeper than this surface parallel.
With Butter, as is the case with many recent comedies, the plot falls second to getting big laughs from the audience. Though there is good humor in Butter, one would expect this film to contain bigger themes and fulfill its potential as a witty satire.
Instead, the film just falls into the enjoyable fall comedy category.

By now, you’ve likely heard a pundit mention that one team or another controls its own destiny.
Just what does it need to do? Run the table.
Climbing the ladder · No. 11 USC has two prime opportunities to move up in the BCS standings: games against No. 2 Oregon and No. 7 Notre Dame. – Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
This is college football speak. This has been uttered before. This is hackneyed. But this also pertains to USC.
What this means is: If a team can win a certain number of its remaining games, it directly influences the outcome of the bowl game it plays in.
Take, for example, No. 1 Alabama. Should the Crimson Tide win the remainder of its games, it would finish the regular season atop the BCS standings, securing a bid to the national championship game on Jan. 7 in Miami. Thus, by merely winning, it controls its own destiny, so to speak. Other factors don’t come into play.
In August, USC, in fact, controlled its own destiny, ranked No. 1 in the Associated Press’ preseason top-25 poll and No. 3 in the USA Today coaches’ poll. Its path to the title game was largely predicated on its own results. If it kept winning, it would have remained near the top of the standings. That was that.
But the Trojans lost the chance on Sept. 15 when they were undone by rival Stanford in Palo Alto, 21-14.
Roughly three weeks since the Bay Area nightmare, USC, which now carries a modest two-game winning streak after victories over California and Utah, has repositioned itself in the national title race. It might not control its own destiny like it once did two months ago, but to say it’s out of the picture would be a gross understatement. If anything, it’s positioned quite well, thanks to a handful of recent events.
The Trojans moved up three spots to No. 9 in the coaches’ poll after a wild Saturday in which three of the nation’s top-five teams lost in a single weekend for the first time since 2002.
Three teams, all previously unbeaten, have seemingly fallen out of the title race for the time being, which naturally helps USC coach Lane Kiffin and Co. as they look to inch toward the top of the rankings again.
“It’s the same thing as when we go the other direction,” Kiffin said following practice Sunday. “It’s out of our control, so we don’t worry about it, don’t pay attention to it. There’s a lot of football left, and as we all know, every week changes.”
But here’s what they can control: winning — and winning certain games.
On Nov. 3, USC will face Oregon at the Coliseum, and on Nov. 24, it’ll host Notre Dame as well. The Ducks and the Fighting Irish are undefeated and ranked No. 2 and No. 7 in the coaches’ poll, respectively. Not to mention both are ranked highly in the BCS computers: Oregon is No. 1 in the Billingsley rankings and Notre Dame stands at No. 1 in Wes Colley’s Matrix — two of the six computer ratings used as part of the BCS formula.
Wins over either school will catapult USC further up the standings, especially considering the impact such wins will have on the Trojans’ strength of schedule.
It doesn’t stop there, either.
Should USC win out — hardly a given but certainly a possibility — it would likely be the highest-ranked one-loss team. That matters: One-loss teams, after all, have crashed the BCS party before.
One-loss Alabama secured a berth in the BCS title game last season, slipping past one-loss (but Big 12 champion) Oklahoma State even after failing to win the SEC. In fact, over the last five seasons, five of the 10 teams to secure a national championship bid have had at least one loss, including both teams in the 2007 and 2008 title games.
This will all be rendered meaningless should USC lose again — distinctly possible considering the teams remaining on its slate, as well as the likelihood of facing Oregon for a second time in the Pac-12 championship game.
But say the team does finish business and post a 12-1 overall mark once the regular season comes to a close. It’s tough not to imagine USC in the middle of the BCS chase, just like old times.
 
“The 19th Hole” runs Tuesdays. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu.
We can lose 2 more games and still make it into a BCS bowl. If we lose to Oregon, Notre Dame and theoretically Washington, we would still be 5-0 in the South, granting us a spot in the Pac-12 Championship game. Although it will be a tough game at Autzen, we have beat them before in Eugene, and then we will receive an automatic berth in the Rose Bowl.
Now let’s say Oregon wins out and beats us twice. They most likely will go to the National Championship game. The Rose Bowl commission has the option to give the Pac-12 spot to the runner up of the division–aka the winner of the South (aka USC)–meaning the pressure is not as intense as everyone is playing it up to be.
Win the South and we go to the Rosebowl.
Now if the point of this article was about us getting back into the championship, then yes we would need to win out. But that is what any team needs to do.
Usc still has a chance to be in the top 3, even 1 again based in how the current top 3 do.  Also what’s interesting, as Chris Dufresne of the LA Times writes in the 10/8 LA Times, he mentions how both USC and the USC on the East Coast, South Carolina, are giving the USC name some additional clout.  Who knows, maybe both USC’s end up the top 2 teams at the end of the road this year.  Then I suppose Trojan and Gamecock fans shoud protest, petition and fight to have a face off between both USC’s; a rivalry reborn; to determine who can proclaim themselves USC, in light of and without paying attention to what the courts ruled on the USC name.  
Signed,
A Gamecock fan, and Trojan loyal Trojan as well; why not; they never play each other anyway; but if they ever do again, I suppose I’ll have to choose.

After two more victories this weekend, the USC women’s volleyball team also swept Pac-12 honors Monday following stellar performances from two of its players.
Junior libero Natalie Hagglund was named Defensive Player of the Week while freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio nabbed Offensive Player of the Week honors for the first time and the Freshman of the Week award for her third time this season.
Hagglund received Defensive Player of the Week honors for the first time in her USC career, becoming the first USC libero to earn the award since Debora Seilhamer in October 2005.
Bricio paced an aggressive USC attack Friday night against Arizona, registering a then-season-high 22 kills to go along with a .475 attacking percentage. She also displayed the all-around talent that has turned heads this season, notching 11 digs for her fourth double double in 17 contests.
Hagglund anchored the defensive side with a consistent effort, notching 17 digs to help the Women of Troy hold the Wildcats to an attacking percentage of .140. The win marked the 11th time the Women of Troy swept an opponent this season.
The two put together an even more impressive performance Sunday against Arizona State, leading the Women of Troy to a 3-1 win. Bricio’s personal record lasted all of two days, as she notched a new career high with 24 kills.
Meanwhile, Hagglund also added 16 digs to complement her .317 attacking percentage. Hagglund seemingly covered the whole court Sunday, recording 32 digs to fall just one dig shy of her personal best.

The nearly flawless season put together so far by the USC women’s volleyball team should come as no surprise — veteran experience has propelled the Women of Troy to a successful start. The likes of Katie Fuller, Natalie Hagglund and Alexis Olgard have become staple names on a team that has its sights set on nothing short of a national championship this season.
But quietly turning heads is outside hitter Samantha Bricio, the 17-year-old freshman phenom who has arguably been the team’s most important contributor thus far.
Defying gravity · Freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio has notched 242 kills across 59 sets this season — a robust 4.1 kills-per-set average. She has 36 more kills than any other player on USC. – Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Bricio, who arrived at USC this season after an impressive high school career in Mexico, has been an integral component of the Women of Troy’s success this season, leading the team with 242 kills and attacking at a clip of .302 to stake the team to a 16-2 mark on the season. But even more impressive is that she’s accomplised this despite her youth and a steep cultural shift.
“The big thing that comes to mind is her maturity for this age,” USC coach Mick Haley said. “She’s only 17, and this is a very big move for her, to come to the United States. She comes from a tight-knit family, a very good family. There’s not a lot of English in the family, and [Bricio] doesn’t use it on a daily basis, so to come here is by no means an easy transition.”
Bricio’s volleyball career started at an early age, with her mom serving as her first coach. She came into her own last year at the age of 16, becoming the youngest member of Mexico’s senior national team. During the team’s run to the 2010 NORCECA Youth Championships, Bricio was a standout, notching 29 points in the championship match and earning Most Valuable Player honors and a silver medal.
These accomplishments emboldened Bricio to come and pit herself against the best American collegiate talent in the rugged Pac-12, knowing her adjustment to American culture and the college lifestyle might be more difficult than her adjustments on the court.
Yet despite these changes, Haley says Bricio’s demeanor off the court, not just her talent, has resonated with her teammates and coaches.
“Another thing that’s been impressive about her — beyond her volleyball skills — is her personality,” Haley said. “She’s very friendly and nice, and she disarms you with her smile.”
Senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller, second on the team with 206 kills, has nothing but praise for Bricio, noting that she has gone above and beyond what the team expected from her before the start of the season.
“Typically, when you have freshmen coming in, you expect them to be nervous and not ready to step up in a starting position,” Fuller said. “We’ve been so fortunate to have four freshmen that are ready to play. For Sam to come in here and take on a leadership role has been wonderful so far.”
USC has felt Bricio’s impact from all angles. Besides kills, she also leads the team with 276 points and 17 service aces in addition to 144 digs, which  ranks fourth behind only Hagglund, Fuller and sophomore setter Hayley Crone.
“She has so much potential. She’s already one of the top scorers in the conference, and she’s only a freshman,” Fuller said. “It will be really exciting to watch her grow. She’s been working hard in the weight room and on the court, and I expect a lot out of her.”
Despite her potential and seemingly effortless performances on the court, Bricio — like most freshmen — is not immune to bouts of homesickness.
“I still haven’t adjusted fully,” Bricio said. “I’m away from home and my family, and I miss them a lot. But I think I just have to keep going, and it’s just going to take some time. I just want to finish my career and be a good player. My teammates treat me like a sister, so it’s been very nice.”
The future is bright for Bricio, who has taken over this team as a freshman and can only get better with experience. Granted, the team has not even reached the halfway point of the season, so it’s tough to determine whether Bricio will maintain her dynamic play. Regardless, Haley doesn’t hold back from predicting a bright future for the team’s youngest member.
“I see her taking more and more leadership for the team. She can be a true person that you want to set the ball to when the game is on the line,” Haley said. “She will become one of the best passer-hitters in the Pac-12.”

In this year’s presidential campaign, President Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have embraced familiar scapegoats for America’s stagnated economic growth — Obama singled out big oil subsidies in last week’s debate and in August, Romney promised to eliminate all government funding of Amtrak.
Xingzhou Zhu | Daily Trojan
Both are examples of popular partisan talking points that appeal to voters but would have little to no effect on the national economy.
Presenting such simple solutions to the nation’s economic woes is a way of appealing to student voters, who especially favor information that is quick and quantified. Politicians take advantage of voters’ interests and manner of absorbing information by presenting one-line solutions that are misleading and extremely narrow in scope. These catch phrases serve only to deceive students into thinking that economic recovery can come about from simple political measures.
The $4 billion in “big oil subsidies” that Obama referred to in last Wednesday’s debate is not specifically designated for petroleum corporations. Rather, these are broad tax credits that reach across the entire energy industry. Ironically, the largest energy subsidy utilized by oil companies is a $1.7 billion manufacturer’s tax deduction designed to keep manufacturing in the United States — a goal that Obama has repeatedly touted as a top priority in his campaign.
Federal funding of Amtrak is even lower than big oil subsidies, costing the U.S. government just $1.56 billion in the 2010 fiscal year. While this figure might seem large at first, it is an almost insignificant number in the larger picture of U.S. government spending. Yet Romney spoke of cutting this funding as though it would make a large difference in America’s economic future.
As Obama did with big oil subsidies and Romney with Amtrak funding, many politicians use scapegoats to make easy connections with voters and to avoid larger issues at hand. For example, entitlement spending — encompassing massive government programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — already consumes 58 percent of federal spending and is growing at an alarming rate. Entitlement spending costs the U.S. government more than $2 trillion each year. Yet both Obama and Romney offered only modest solutions to responsibly sustain these programs through the next generation. Both politicians instead referred to symbolic measures like oil subsidies and Amtrak funding that appeal to many voters, but have almost no effect on America’s economy or national debt.
Both proposals are prime examples of exactly what student voters so often fall for, because it seems like such a simple comparative choice: eliminate oil subsidies or Amtrak funding to improve the economy.
In an age when Twitter and Facebook present the news in more simplified ways than ever, it has become customary for students to expect these simple, cookie-cutter solutions to complex national problems. Unfortunately, Democrats and Republicans are increasingly relying on these types of misleading talking points to exploit student voters who don’t expend the effort to dig deeper into issues.
It is imperative that students challenge popular one-line catch phrases and be skeptical of politicians employing false arguments and emotional appeal for political gain. If students continue to absorb talking points and overlook counterarguments, they will gradually lose their collective power as voters and become nothing more than pawns in Washington’s political games.

After reading about the Austrian economics and Economic Sophisms by Bastiat it becomes very clear that all forms of taxes going to businesses for behaviors is a crime of theft of the treasury. And to use debt to fund the treasury makes it an even worse crime.

During last Wednesday’s debate, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that he plans to remove the federal subsidy for the Public Broadcasting Service. This statement reveals Romney’s weak and hypocritical policies in two ways.
One, PBS costs next to nothing when compared to other sections of the federal budget, and two, such a plan conflicts with Romney’s education-endorsing rhetoric throughout the debate, especially in light of PBS’s educational value.
Romney’s now-famous Big Bird line was: “I’m sorry, Jim. I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I’m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. … But I’m not going to — I’m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That’s number one.”
So how much money would be spent on public broadcasting next year? The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the federal distributor of PBS and National Public Radio’s funding, will receive $445 million from the federal government in 2013, according to the House’s Committee on Appropriations.
This amount is a pittance when compared with $1.5 trillion spent on benefits programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security each year, not to mention the annual $700 billion that the Department of Defense demands. Proportionally, the Department of Defense receives nearly 1,600 times more money than public broadcast services. In other words, the government spends the same amount in one year on public broadcasting as the Pentagon spends in six hours.
Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a highly respected astrophysicist and frequent PBS contributor, highlighted this point on Twitter the night of the debate.
“Cutting PBS support (0.012 percent of budget) to help balance the Federal budget is like deleting text files to make room on your 500Gig hard drive,” he tweeted.
As Tyson’s simile illustrates, to cut public broadcasting funding would accomplish next to nothing. It’s crucial for voters — Obama and Romney supporters alike — to understand that slashing public broadcasting would do absolutely nothing to alleviate federal budget woes.
But beyond the budgetary issue is the importance of maintaining public broadcasting, an incredible educational source. Throughout the debate, Romney asserted his commitment to education several times, stating that, “I’m not going to cut education funding … I’m planning on continuing to grow, so I’m not planning on making changes there.”
Much like many of his ill-formed ideologies, Romney’s statement about PBS in light of this apparent passion for improving education is hypocritical and detrimental.
And public broadcasting is an educational service: Programs from NOVA, a show dedicated to science, to Frontline, a series devoted to in-depth documentaries and investigative journalism, exist to educate viewers on a wide range of important topics.
Additionally, public broadcasting provides an extraordinary amount of programming oriented at young children — which helps build something the nation desperately needs: an educated, prosperous future. Though Romney’s Big Bird reference quickly became a national meme, Sesame Street reaches millions of children across the country in its effort to promote early childhood literacy and quantitative skills. PBS President and CEO Paula Kerger stated in an interview with CNN last Thursday that PBS is “America’s biggest classroom.” When considering that shows produced for PBS Kids dominate Nielsen ratings for children under six, it’s hard to disagree.
If Romney sincerely plans to “[continue] to grow” education, he would know that cutting public broadcasting is not the way to do it.
Neither PBS nor any other public broadcasting program is the cause of the American federal deficit. Romney’s insinuation that public broadcasting somehow significantly contributes to the deficit is a red-herring argument that distracts voters from the real budget issues at hand: an immensely bloated military budget and an inefficient entitlements system.
Though Romney’s statement was made in the haste of a timed debate, voters should not forget its implications in the voting booth come November. Considering all that public broadcasting, such as PBS and NPR, offers — high quality educational programming viewed or heard by hundreds of millions of Americans every month — in conjunction with its remarkably small monetary footprint, Romney’s plans to cut PBS are, frankly, remarkably uninformed.

“This statement reveals Romney’s weak and hypocritical policies in two ways.” Boy, you sound like a Bruin in a Trojan Horse…maybe you should have gone to UCLA with opinions like that in your first sentence.
When you are broke you have to cut the easy things and the hard things. PBS is just another corporation that doesn’t need a hand out, but takes it anyway. Of each dollar the Federal government spends $0.40 is borrowed. China has stopped buying our debt – who has the money to replace them?
Written like a true freshman. Well intentioned and nicely prepared…what you miss in your arguements is that uncle sam is literally broke amd borrowing 1.5 TRILLION. OF OUR 4 TRILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL BUDGET from very hostile creditors. It is a symbolic cut meant to demonstrate seriousness of intent to reduce thelis country killing deficit. Think this goverment spending doesnt effect you? Wait till you try to geta job, buy a house,
Do anything meaningfull where affordable credit is required. In reality, there endless desireable govwrnment programs that wlll need to be cut or eliminated to get our house in order. By the way guess who will be paying off the giant for generations? Answer: you and your childrens children. It will come in. The form of higher taxes, permanent high unemployment and more government intrusion in all areas of your life. Pbs is a realtively small part of the federal budget but a good place to start in showing that we can save this magnificent ship of stae that currently is listing hard to port and in danger of sinking.
Let’s first ask why government is involved with televised education in the first place.
It’s a great idea, except now we have the Internet.
It’s a great idea, except it requires subsidies to keep it running.
It’s a great idea, except it’s not profitable.
So it’s not really that great of an idea. Sorry, but this is about efficiency – not education reform.
Please, stop calling Medicare and Social Security “entitlements”.  They are not  entitlements!  I have been paying into the system for years and if they are truly entitlements, then I want back all the money I have paid in.  Please, stop with the entitlement bull and start looking at things the way they are.  I love PBS, This Old House and all, but nothing at our local station has been even remotely good in years.  If it is worthy, as KA LaVoie stated, it will survive.  But how about cutting bloated salaries of senators and congressmen?  How about giving them a taste of reality and making them pay for insurance and the like, just like we little people do?  That certainly would eat away a chunk of budgetary woes, wouldn’t it?
The issue is not that it is only $445 million…the issue is our government should not be funding it. PBS and NPR are just examples of things that must be cut from the federal budget. I happen to love PBS, but it should be funded by individuals who chose to send their dollars that direction. If it is worthy, it will survive.
“One, PBS costs next to nothing when compared to other sections of the federal budget, and two, such a plan conflicts with Romney’s education-endorsing rhetoric throughout the debate, especially in light of PBS’s educational value.”
Regarding number one, $445 million here and $445 million there and pretty soon you’re talking real money.  
Regarding your second point, the contribution of PBS to education isn’t very well defined.  Although it has many educational shows, it won’t improve education if nobody is watching them.  Plus, every time I check PBS (other than when Charlie Rose is on) it seems like their programming is all from the ’90’s.
Anyway, PBS is taken for granted.  Romney is doing PBS a favor by saying it’s in trouble.  If it truly is worth keeping, we can find a way to save it.

This past week, the most talked about television moments didn’t come from Glee’s multiple, melodramatic breakups or the much anticipated return of 30 Rock. On Wednesday night, it was President Barack Obama and his opponent Governor Mitt Romney who captivated audiences everywhere during the first of three presidential election debates.
Nearly 67.2 million people tuned in to watch the passionate political match-up, a statistic no other presidential debate has seen since 1992, according to Nielsen.
But after audience members dispersed from Magness Arena and the news pundits moved on to the next big story, it was late night comedy’s turn to have some laughs with this essential and telling aspect of our democratic process.
The debate’s aftermath bred numerous satirical spin-offs, proving once again that election years continue to be a comedy writer’s best friend. Late Night with Jimmy Fallon decided to poke fun at the debate’s moderator, PBS NewsHour anchor Jim Lehrer. Politics aside, most could agree that Lehrer was (at best) passive and bumbling in his attempt to guide the night’s conversation. Thus, “Romney & Obama Tell Lehrer to Shut the F— Up” was born. Fallon, playing an impeccable Romney, articulated what we were all thinking when he told the actor playing Lehrer to “shut your yapper” because “you’re a worthless human being.”
Over at ABC, Jimmy Kimmel organized a focus group with children to get their take on the debate since “kids love politics.” After quizzing the youngsters on the candidates’ names (“Mitt Ronnie!” one exclaimed), Kimmel managed to hilariously convince them that Obama spends his entire paycheck every week on cotton candy.
And of course, no major political occurrence can pass without the maestros at Saturday Night Live having their shot at it first. The skewering was at its finest during the cold open, where former cast member Chris Parnell returned as Lehrer, and Jay Pharaoh and Jason Sudeikis put on their best Obama and Romney suits, respectively. In a clever twist, we heard the imagined inner monologues of the three men: Obama preoccupied with getting a last-minute gift for Michelle and feeling woozy due to the altitude; Romney feeling overly-satisfied with his listed answers; and Lehrer downright fuming over Romney’s plans to cut funding to PBS. Later in the show, Big Bird himself even showed up at the “Weekend Update” to defend his honor. And for those playing at home, that was no understudy: Seth Meyers revealed via Twitter on Sunday that really was Carroll Spinney, the Muppeteer who’s been performing as Big Bird since 1969.
With 29 days to go until the election, there is simply no better time for knockout political humor than right now. Be sure to keep up with the late night election-themed viral videos circling around Hulu, as well as new episodes of SNL on Oct. 13 and 20. And just think: we still have the vice presidential debate to look forward to this Thursday night.

Following USC’s 38-28 victory over the Utah Utes on Saturday, the Trojans moved up to the No. 11 spot in the Associated Press top-25 poll and the No. 9 spot in the USA Today Coaches’ poll. USC was previously ranked No. 13 and No. 12, respectively.
USC’s win, while not dominant, was boosted by the losses of other ranked teams. The Florida State Seminoles—formerly No. 3 in the AP poll—were upset by unranked North Carolina State. The Georgia Bulldogs were blown out in an SEC battle against South Carolina, and the Texas Longhorns suffered a close defeat against West Virginia and Heisman frontrunner Geno Smith. The LSU Tigers were also defeated over the weekend, but remain ahead of USC in both polls after falling on the road against a highly regarded Florida squad.
Oregon remains the class of the Pac-12 at the No. 2 slot in both polls after blowing out the Washington Huskies 52-21. Oregon State comes in second at the No. 10 ranking in the AP poll and No. 14 in the USA Today Coaches’ poll. Stanford moved up one spot to No. 17 after narrowly defeating Arizona in overtime.
Washington and UCLA both dropped out of the rankings after losing over the weekend.
Starting next weekend, the BCS rankings will begin rolling out. Most analysts have USC slated in the 10-13 range based on their accomplishments thus far.

Just when everyone thought Myspace was dead and gone, the social network site launched a new version of Myspace: Myspace.
Although the name for the upgraded Myspace has not changed at all, the website has a completely different design. Deviating from its old blue and orange layout, Myspace is now sleek and – dare I say it – a work of art.
On their current homepage, the new Myspace makes it clear who they are targeting by saying, “So whether you’re a musician, photographer, filmmaker, designer or just a dedicated fan, we’d love for you to be part of our brand new community.”
The way the new Myspace is formatted also specifically caters to this creative audience. Imagine Pinterest, Tumblr and Facebook rolled into one site. Now sprinkle a little hipster dust onto this social media Frankenstein and you’ll get the new Myspace.
But let’s face the facts. Even though Justin Timberlake has created a ton of buzz by tweeting about website and even though the new Myspace is a digital aesthete’s dream, will it actually take off? With Facebook having recently reached its one billion active user mark, it seems like the new Myspace is going to have a lot of catching up to do.
And let’s also consider the fact that the name “Myspace” carries a virtual stigma. Bring up Myspace in a conversation and I guarantee you will elicit a couple of grimaces from your friends.
But maybe Myspace has changed for the better. Maybe it’s time that we give it a second chance. After being the butt of social network jokes for so long, this could be Myspace’s opportunity to redefine itself and social networking. The new Myspace might even take the virtual world by storm and become a second Facebook. Who knows?

President Barack Obama stopped in Los Angeles on Sunday to speak at his star-studded “30 Days to Victory Concert” at LA Live.
More than 6,000 people packed the Nokia Theatre to hear an all-star lineup of musical acts including Katy Perry, Jon Bon Jovi, Stevie Wonder and Earth, Wind & Fire.
Actor George Clooney, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and San Antonio, Texas Mayor Julian Castro — the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention — also spoke.
“They just perform flawlessly, night after night,” Obama said of the performers. “I can’t always say the same.”
He was referring to his debate performance last week with Republican challenger and presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
With that comment Obama joined a large group of politicians, comedians and critics who have poked fun at his lackluster debate routine.
Obama gave his standard campaign speech — slamming Romney for proposed tax cuts and plans to end funding for public broadcasting. He also highlighted the new 7.8 percent unemployment rate as the lowest during his presidency.
“Everybody always remembers the victory, but they don’t always remember the bumps in the road. … Things always look good in retrospect,” Obama said, reminiscing on his 2008 campaign. “But in the middle of it we made all kinds of mistakes. We goofed up. I goofed up. But the American people carried up forward.”
Tickets for the “30 Days to Victory Concert” ranged from $44 to $2,500 each. The concert’s affordability and its proximity to USC attracted several students.
Kaya Masler, president of Trojans for Obama, attended the event with about 20 other USC students, some who earned volunteer tickets from the Obama campaign.
“Moving forward from last week was good,” she said. “It was great that he was able to acknowledge his own goof but continue to pound his message and motivate his base.”
Campaign officials announced that free transportation, gas and hotel stays would be provided to any groups of 12 or more that would canvass for Obama in Nevada.
Nevada is a key swing state that Democrats and Republicans need to clinch a victory in November.
Trojans for Obama, a USC student organization, will be traveling to Las Vegas the next two weekends to canvass and register voters.
Joshua Carroll, a sophomore majoring in broadcast journalism, immediately bought his ticket last month for the “30 Days to Victory Concert” with about five friends.
“This event was so close to campus that I knew I couldn’t miss it,” Carroll said.
Carroll, his roommate and a few others rode the Metro train line Downtown to attend the event.
“This was my first time seeing the president, and this election will be my first time voting,” Carroll said.
It is estimated that Obama’s L.A. events pulled in as much as $7 million. He will inaugurate the Cesar E. Chavez National Monument in Kenne, Calif. on Monday afternoon, then travel to San Francisco for another star-studded concert with John Legend.
