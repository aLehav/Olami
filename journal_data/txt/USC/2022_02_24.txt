The No. 5 USC men’s volleyball team lost 3-2 in its first MPSF conference game to No. 7 Pepperdine after a two hour and 30 minute-long battle. The loss makes them 0-1 to open conference play. 
The Trojans had a five game losing streak against Pepperdine prior to this matchup, and they faced a challenge with an away crowd in Pepperdine’s Firestone Fieldhouse. 
“That Pepperdine gym is a difficult environment … We struggle with that,” said senior middle blocker Liam Schroeder. 
USC was riding a hot 10-2 start to the season, and Schroeder said that he felt the game plan was in place to execute.  
“I think we had a good scouting report coming into this game. We kind of had a good anticipation of what to expect,” Schroeder said. 
The Trojans started off the game strong with a 25-23 win in the first set, but the Waves roared back for a 25-17 win in the second. Pepperdine then used its momentum to take a hard-fought third set by a score of 28-26. 
The Trojans were able to fight back and win the fourth set 26-24 to force a winner-takes-all fifth set, where they eventually fell 15-13. 
USC ended the game with four players having double-digit kills. Graduate outside hitter/opposite hitter/setter Sam Korbine led the team with 20 kills; redshirt sophomore opposite hitter Simon Gallas contributed 16 kills; senior outside hitter Brandon Browning had 14 and Schroeder had 10. 
Unforced Trojan errors only helped the Waves, who especially capitalized on Trojan service errors in the second and third sets. The Trojans had 26 attacking errors compared to only 20 attacking errors for the Waves. They also had 21 service errors, compared to only Pepperdine’s 15. 
“We can’t be giving them free points like that,” Schroeder said.
USC’s close loss showed room for growth and a chance at ending its losing streak against the Waves.
“I think it’s really going to come down to serve and pass, and I know we have it in us to really propel ourselves past them,” Schroeder said. 
The Trojans will get another shot at beating Pepperdine, this time on their own court, at 7 p.m. Friday, Feb. 25 at Galen Center. 
“I think we play really well at Galen, and I’m confident that we can come away with a big victory,” Schroeder said.

The Center for the Political Future hosted a virtual discussion Wednesday in partnership with the Center for the Premodern World to explore, starting with the Silk Roads, the history that led to today’s complex United States-China relationship. 
Moderated by co-director of the Center for the Political Future Mike Murphy, the event featured speakers Oxford University professor of global history Peter Frankopan, Yale University professor of Chinese and world history Valerie Hansen,  East Asian languages and cultures professor David C. Kang, and East Asia Program at Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft director Michael D. Swaine. 
After brief introductions, Murphy invited Hansen to share some background on the Silk Road’s impact on China’s outlook and relations with European and other nations. 
According to Hansen, use of the Silk Road started in the second century B.C. and continued through until 1000 or 1500 A.D. The routes were significant channels of foreign influence on China, although Hansen noted the complexity in China’s contact with other countries. 
“In the beginning, the Chinese didn’t have a view of the outside,” Hansen said. “In the beginning, China was not a unified block. It’s a bunch of different regional kingdoms, and they have contact with each other and then they also have contact with powers to the West.”
Swaine also cautioned against generalization and elaborated on China’s history, a train of various dynasties and federations with different views on issues such as security. These federations experienced friction and conflict with their neighbors, as well as periods of relative peace and calm. Relationships were often built on mutually beneficial trade rather than military aggression, with some exceptions. The past 150 years have been most important in shaping the China of today, Swaine said. 
“Interactions with its periphery and with countries further afield on the basis of very unequal relations, a large part of that was Western imperialism; the kind of division that that created within the country, especially when the country was weak,” Swaine said. “You’ve had a history of this kind of experience that I think really has a very strong influence on China today.” 
Frankopan presented an alternative to the common conceptualization of the Silk Roads as a link between China and Europe, preferring to envision them as a “big web” of links between various small communities. He also said that interactions such as knowledge transfer between some of these communities started long before the second century B.C. Frankopan explained China’s attempts to connect with the past and bring it to the present.
“You could characterize China under President Xi as making China great again,” Frankopan said. “This is kind of the signature move of the 21st century, which is: ‘This is what China once was, this is how it connected to the outside world, we’re going to resurrect and reheat these kinds of networks.”’
Moving into the modern era, the speakers discussed — in contrast to the Western narrative — the Chinese perspective on their increasing power and economic growth. Hansen presented the “spin answer” of China retaking its “rightful place in the world,” a message found in many of President Xi’s speeches.
“So the question is, ‘What is he thinking about?’” Hansen said. “Is there a historical moment that he’s thinking about?”
According to Hansen, historically, due to the size of its population in a time when size equated to power, China was often the biggest, most powerful country. 
Swaine agreed that this was a common message from the president, but said that the president does not completely represent Chinese attitudes. 
“I do think it’s important to not simply boil whatever China’s thinking and intending down to what Xi Jinping thinks,” Swaine said. “He’s a particular type of leader who’s playing on Chinese nationalists and other feelings to maintain order and stability in a very rapidly moving society …. and to serve the status and prestige feelings of the Chinese population.”
The speakers then offered their thoughts on what is overlooked in the U.S.’s response to China’s rise. Kang highlighted East Asia’s hegemony compared to Europe and the history of relations in the region. Smaller surrounding nations such as Korea and Vietnam have historical experience interacting with a large, powerful China that prepared them for China’s recent rise. 
“One reason you are seeing a muted response from all the countries in the region to China’s rise is this is totally expected,” Kang said. “They know they have to live with a big China. That’s not a question … Now, the present day is totally different from the past. So yes, it’s a modern system … but they’ve done it before and that’s what they’re trying to do today.”
Swaine added that such countries rely on China for growth, a strong incentive to maintain friendly relations. He believed that China expects a certain degree of acquiescence from these countries but has not articulated a clear vision for the region.
“Does China think that it needs to in some meaningful way dominate the region?” Swaine said. “Or is China willing to live with a region where it doesn’t have that kind of dominant power, but it certainly is respected in a variety of ways, but then it can engage with other nations in the region on a common basis, on a common foundation more or less, and can this be done without the United States controlling the situation, if you will, influencing how Asian countries interact?”
The speakers then shared the ways they hope people will better understand China.
Hansen clarified that, historically, China had never been isolated from the outside world to the extent that people often believe. Frankopan and Kang both underscored the limited nature of people’s understanding of China.
Kang emphasized the importance of developing an understanding of Eastern history comparable to that of European histories. Promoting this historical awareness and considering the lessons of Eastern history more seriously, he said, is key to discerning how people view themselves and their relations to each other.  
“Intuitively, shouldn’t regions of the world with different philosophies, different religions, different languages, social structures — why wouldn’t the politics be different as well?” Kang said. “I think a centering of East Asian history would be a great step in the right direction.”

Brian Smedley, an equity scholar at the Urban Institute and the author of the book “Unequal Health: Anti-Black Racism and the Threat to American Health,” discussed the ingrained racism within the United States healthcare industry during a webinar miniseries at USC’s Center for Health Journalism.
Smedley began by presenting a definition of racism provided by Camara Jones, a renowned epidemiologist and anti-racism activist, in her study “Confronting Institutionalized Racism.”
“Racism is a system of structuring opportunity and assigning value based on phenotypic properties (i.e., skin color and hair texture) associated with race,” Jones wrote. “There are four forms of racism, structural, institutional, individually-mediated and internalized.” 
In its 2003 seminal report “Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care,” Smedley’s team at the Institute of Medicine concluded that “racial and ethnic minorities experience a lower quality of health services, and are less likely to receive even routine medical procedures than are white Americans.”
Twenty years later, the U.S. has “not made significant progress toward eliminating these healthcare disparities,” Smedley said.
“Unfortunately, for many patients, this is a matter of life and death,” he said.
Smedley cited the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s 2021 National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Report. Since 2000, disparities “have narrowed for only about 8% of measures of American Indian and Alaska Native populations, 2% of measures for Asian populations, 3% of measures for Black populations, 4% of measures for Hispanic populations, and 10% of measures of Native Hawalian/Pacific Islander populations,” according to the report.
The report also mentioned that patients of color are less likely than white patients to receive preventive care and kidney transplants.
Smedley concluded that there are multiple factors associated with healthcare inequity, including the separate and inequitable healthcare system in which people of color are disproportionately under-resourced.
“People of color are disproportionately concentrated in lower tier, under-resourced, lower quality health care systems, safety net institutions and other systems that struggle to provide high-quality care,” Smedley said.
Smedley also discussed the ways tiered health insurance and differences in provider reimbursement contribute to the inequity.
“Patients who are covered by Medicaid, for example. Medicaid continues to struggle to provide the level of reimbursement necessary to attract providers to provide these services to patients,” Smedley said. 
Implicit clinician biases, stereotypes and prejudice against patients of color also contributed to the disparity, the study found. As people become socialized into their culture, these feelings and beliefs become increasingly ingrained that they are often triggered automatically.
“Even if you as an individual find those beliefs abhorrent, no doubt you are aware of those broad societal beliefs, and you may even find that those belief systems infect your thinking in ways that you are not consciously aware of,” Smedley said.
A persistent lack of diversity among healthcare professionals is closely linked to the lingering racism in the healthcare system. According to a AHRQ study, only 5% of physicians nationwide identify as African American.
“What I’m suggesting is that increasing diversity among our healthcare workforce can increase the capacity of U.S. healthcare systems overall, to better address the needs of a growing and diverse U.S. population,” Smedley said.
All of these factors combined created the “Medical Apartheid,” which refers to the separate and inequitable care for patients of color.
Smedley proposed interventions to tackle these factors that contribute to healthcare inequality, such as improving diversity among physicians. In a 2005 report at the Institute of Medicine, Smedley suggested de-emphasizing standardized tests which could negatively affect the ability of students of color to matriculate into health professional programs. He also discussed stopping the inappropriate use of patient race in medical diagnoses and treatments.
Michelle Levander, moderator of the webinar and founding director of the Center for Health Journalism, said the conversation was “inspiring and illuminating” and led a Q&A session at the end of the webinar. Smedley said that healthcare inequalities hurt all Americans through social, economic and environmental costs.
“We as a society have a moral imperative to ensure that healthcare is equitable and just for every patient,” Smedley said. “Widespread disparities should not exist and, in fact, are antithetical to our beliefs as a nation in terms of egalitarian ideals.”

Undergraduate Student Government released a statement Tuesday regarding a controversial comment posted by the official USG Instagram account during Friday’s presidential candidate debate broadcasted on Annenberg Media’s Instagram Live. 
“I think door to door soliciting isn’t allowed lol so idk how they are gonna do that,” the @uscusg Instagram account commented in response to the Rachel Lee and Collin Colson ticket outlining their campaign strategy, which included knocking on people’s doors.
Lee and Colson, who are write-in candidates for president and vice president, asked for an apology from USG and for their names to be put on the ballot in an Instagram post Tuesday.
In its statement, USG said “the internal digital strategy team” and several candidate tickets had access to the USG Instagram account” and that “USG cannot identify who is responsible for the remark” at this time.
“We do acknowledge USG’s internal responsibility for the lapse in oversight that allowed this event to occur,” the statement read. “We apologize for the confusion this error may have caused and reemphasize our strong commitment to remaining impartial.” 
The statement continues, writing that USG will “work diligently to ensure our communication channels protect the integrity of our election processes.”
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Colson said the ticket wants more action from USG as a result of the comment. The Daily Trojan Editorial Board released an article Tuesday condemning the comment, demanding that USG issue a “public and permanent apology” and calling it a “blatant disregard of professionalism.”
“After the Daily Trojan [editorial] came out and exposed to a greater audience that kind of behavior, we really wanted an apology and we wanted the write-in candidates to be put on the ballot,” Colson said. “While it’s nice to hear words of apology from USG, it’d be better to see action.”
Weston Bell-Geddes and Erica Wang, who dropped out of the presidential race Feb. 3, expressed support for the write-in candidates in an Instagram post Wednesday. 
“It is incredibly disappointing to see how USG is handling what is supposed to be a fair, democratic process,” their post read. “[The write-in candidates] should be on the ballot. Write them in!”
USG has not contacted either member of the Lee-Colson ticket individually, according to Colson. in an interview with the Daily Trojan, USG president Alexis Areias said USG is apologetic and looking into who posted the comment to “ensure USG is an impartial body that has no business making any influence in the current elections.”
“First and foremost, I think what I want to say to the Lee-Colson campaign is they have a right to be frustrated, and it’s very understandable to to be feeling the way that they are,” Areias said. “We made a mistake … and I’m sorry that we even got to this place in the first place.” 
The Lee-Colson ticket entered the presidential election race as write-in candidates, blending satire such as a pledge to commission a Saweetie statue “1 inch taller than Tommy Trojan,” and a desire to make real change by abolishing Greek life, reversing gentrification in South Central and defunding the Department of Public Safety. The ticket also emphasized that its position as an outsider will help it to better open lines of communication with the student body. 
The debate, which USG and Annenberg Media hosted, was intended to give each ticket a fair chance to express its platform. Supporters of Lee-Colson interpreted the comment as USG bias against Lee-Colson’s anti-USG campaign. 
Colson said the Instagram accounts’ comment is representative of unfair practices that “we feel are undemocratic.”
“Rachel and I have been very displeased with how this election has been carried out. There have been a lot of policies that we feel are undemocratic,” Colson said. “We wanted to change things about USC, but we can’t do that if the hill is steeper for us than it is for others.”

Registered nurses at the USC Verdugo Hills Hospital held an “informational picket” and car caravan Wednesday calling attention to concerns about understaffing and insufficient workplace protections against the coronavirus. The demonstration was not meant as a work stoppage and did not cause any delays or inconvenience for patient care.
The workers, represented by the California Nurses Association/National Nurses United, gathered outside the Glendale hospital to protest inaction on ongoing staff concerns about patient safety and staffing. According to a CAN/NNU press release Tuesday, the nurses demand the isolation of suspected and confirmed coronavirus-positive patients, and the provision of “appropriate” personal protective equipment. 
Ruby Carpo, a RN in the emergency department at USC-VHH, said she has seen the harm short staffing has had on patient care. Her unit, which deals with coronavirus-related intake and life-threatening emergencies, has “more patients than we can handle,” Carpo said, causing delays in assessment and treatment. 
“Sometimes, we have patients that wait for about three to four hours in the waiting room before we can get to them because we do not have enough nurses,” said Carpo in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “Sometimes we don’t have enough rooms to take care of the patients.”
The issue is exacerbated, Carpo said, by understaffing in other departments, such as the intensive care unit, requiring the ER to provide spaces for non-ER patients. The hospital has seen a 40% RN turnover rate since 2019, which Carpo said has been driven by a shortage of nurses willing to risk their license. 
“Nobody wants to work in an unsafe environment,” Carpo said. “That’s why we did the informational picketing because we want to be able to demonstrate that, to the hospital, we’re morally exhausted of being treated like we’re all dispensable.”
After contract negotiations paused abruptly at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, nurses signed a two-year contract in an effort to “take care of patients first,” Carpo said. Now that the contract’s term has nearly elapsed, nurses look to reach a new “fair” contract that will retain and recruit experienced nurses. Negotiations began again last December, according the union.
In a statement issued Tuesday ahead of the demonstration, USC-VHH wrote that the hospital has “upheld exemplary safety measures throughout the pandemic” and bolsters employee wellness in the way of support services through its Care for the Caregiver program. 
“We respect the right of our CNA members to demonstrate and recognize that they are an essential part of what makes our health care facility among the best in the country,” the statement read. “The hospital looks forward to resuming discussions with CNA and is hopeful we can successfully negotiate a new contract.”
During Wednesday’s demonstration, nurses were encouraged to use their work breaks to participate in the picket line. More than 90 nurses came out to voice their concerns, out of the approximately 270 nurses employed at USC-VHH. The turnout, Carpo said, was likely dampened by the fact that many nurses hold other jobs and were unavailable during the day. Nonetheless, Carpo estimated that 90% of her unit participated in the picketing.
The coronavirus case surge driven by the highly contagious omicron variant added to staff concerns about patient and nurse safety, Carpo said. Approximately one dozen nurses tested positive for the coronavirus in the last 30 days, and several staff across other departments, such as the central processing department, also got “wiped out.” The rapid influx of patients, combined with a decrease in staffing, led to nurses interacting with coronavirus positive patients placed in hallways without proper protection.
“We have patients in the waiting room that are known COVID positive, but then we can’t place them anywhere because, again, we’re inundated with patients inside the hospital and inside the department,” Carpo said. “We’re not properly dressed or equipped for it. We’re not wearing our gowns and other stuff that we should be wearing because they’re in the hallway.”
Wednesday’s demonstration served to call the hospital’s attention to escalating staff concerns and “moral exhaustion” amid current contract negotiations. A continued trend of nurse resignations has brought working RNs out, Carpo said, because they “just can’t ignore it anymore.”
“The bottom line is, we would not be out there if [the hospital was] being fair with a contract,” Carpo said. “This is our way of demonstrating to them that we’re united, we have one voice and that we are done with risking our licenses and we’re done risking patient safety.”

Los Angeles County will lift its indoor mask mandate for establishments that require proof of vaccination Friday, according to a L.A. County Department of Public Health news release Wednesday. 
USC faculty, students and staff are required to show Trojan Check — which includes proof of vaccination — to enter campus, recreational sports facilities and Galen Center. 
The University has previously said that it intends to follow L.A. County coronavirus guidelines, meaning that the University could potentially alter its indoor masking requirement Friday.
“The university has received the guidance from the county about indoor masking and is reviewing it. We will provide additional information as soon as it is available,” USC wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Wednesday. 
According to L.A. County guidelines, establishments can require proof of a negative coronavirus test for an individual to enter maskless if they are unvaccinated — within the past 24 hours if the test is antigen and 48 hours if it is PCR.
More than 95% students are currently vaccinated and 75% are boosted, according to a Feb. 8 student health media briefing. Students with approved exemptions — approximately 2%, according to September data — are currently required to test every 72 hours, and those who are not up to date on vaccinations, such as booster shots, are required to test every four days.
Positivity rates have declined significantly at USC over the past few weeks. The student positivity rate is currently 1%, a decrease from a high of 14.79% peak reported for the week of Jan. 2. The employee positivity rate is currently .768%, a decrease from a high of 13.33% reported the week of Dec. 26.
L.A. County positivity rates have also decreased since the omicron surge’s peak, with a test positivity rate down to 2.3% from a high of over 20% in early January. 
Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman announced Friday that USC will lift many of its coronavirus policies March 1st, including no longer requiring weekly surveillance testing for fully vaccinated and boosted students, reversing its “no-guest” policy in residential halls and ceasing its gym reservation programs. Van Orman also announced the end to the University’s outdoor masking requirement, effective Feb. 16.
“At this point in the pandemic, we are looking at the future with plans to modify protocols that remove mitigation levels as public health orders are revised to lift restrictions,” wrote Van Orman Feb. 18.

I will be the first to say that any book written before the 2000s declared a “classic” is bound to have more than one questionable thing about it, but we’ll get into the problems I have with “Jane Eyre” at a later time. For now, bear with me as I go into the rabbit hole of the cultural phenomena that is “Rebecca” and its tie to the one and only: Taylor Swift. 
“Rebecca” follows an unnamed protagonist who falls in love with a rich widower, Maxim de Winter, who the narrator supposes is still madly in love with his deceased wife, Rebecca. Rebecca had mysteriously died in a boating accident, although it is later revealed that de Winter murdered her and, consequently, is facing legal repercussions. The narrator does everything in her power to help her husband get away with murder, and, to no one’s surprise, he does. 
The thing that angers me about this “jet-set Bonnie and Clyde” ending is that it comes at the expense of a (mostly innocent) woman. Rebecca lived a lavish life of luxury and — I’ll admit, more questionably — shared a bed with a number of lovers. However, it makes one wonder why the practice of cheating is deemed acceptable or casual when men realize this is most certainly not a death sentence and end up doing it. However, when Rebecca was caught with her lover, somehow, that justified de Winter murdering her and then faking a boat crash to attempt to silence the truth. 
What’s even worse is that the narrator, a woman, seems to not care how easily disposable Rebecca was to de Winter and decides to stand by his side. 
“Rebecca” is the most irritating classic to read.
Somehow, however, when someone asks me for book recommendations, the word “Rebecca” non-consensually falls from my lips. Why? 
Maybe it’s because I am an unapologetic Swiftie and am currently in the process of permanently marking “Taylor’s Version” on my skin, or possibly, it’s the book obsession that began during middle school and has now amounted to me adding a narrative structure minor to my academic path. Maybe it’s both. 
Welcome to Fan-them Diaries: a fandom-obsessed college student ranting about anything and everything pertaining to books and their intersection with modern pop culture.
I got the idea to write this column in summer 2020 when I started writing commentary on every book I’d burned through while finishing off my unread shelves. It began with me writing about “Little Women” and why I think Aunt March is gay, then expanded to ideas like this one: How does “Rebecca” become redeemable only through Taylor Swift’s “evermore”? 
The 2020 phenomena, “evermore,” is most known for its beautifully heartbreaking “champagne problems” and the single “willow,” but midway through the tracklist, it hides the gem “tolerate it.” The song is about a young woman who is with an “older and wiser” man that ignores her best efforts to make him love her. Sound familiar? 
One of the biggest plot points in “Rebecca” is the narrator’s paranoia that de Winter is not over his former wife. She tries to be a suitable partner for his lavish lifestyle once his former wife is gone, but nothing seems like enough.
In Taylor Swift’s song, the lyrics “use my best colors for your portrait” made me do a double take. In “Rebecca,” the narrator hosts a costume party and gets the idea to dress like de Winter’s favorite portrait, quite literally using her best colors to impress him. 
The parallels between “tolerate it” and “Rebecca” are uncanny — the protagonists of both are haunted by an idea of having to be perfect for their lover and are not seeing the validation of their devotion. One of the breaking points, however, is how the story ends.
Unlike “Rebecca,” Swift’s protagonist “break[s] free and leaves [him] in ruins” as she begins to recognize the value of her love. I’d wish nothing less than justice for Rebecca, a justice I imagine finally arrives in “tolerate it” after du Maurier’s gravely disappointing end. 
But notice I said “evermore” redeemed “Rebecca,” not just “tolerate it.” Swift’s parallels don’t end there.
A more comedic parallel appears in “no body, no crime,” which is notorious for interconnecting in the Styles-Swift manslaughter theory that stemmed from “Out of the Woods” — a story for another day — but it also has a connection to “Rebecca.” In the book, Rebecca’s murder was covered up by a staged boating accident. In the song, the lyrics read, “Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was 15,” and, of course, the story is also about infidelity, paranoia and an implied murder mystery — a story eerily similar to Rebecca’s.
Let me explain my thought process. 
I’d like to imagine this world where, upon finding out de Winter’s murdered Rebecca for simply living her best life, the unnamed protagonist, in a fit of anger, decides to get justice for her predecessor and murders him. You guessed it, this murder mimics the “accident” de Winter staged: a boating accident. 
I believe du Maurier did not consider the repercussions of having women refuse to stand by women — especially when that novel was adapted to Netflix and appeared on a Daily Trojan book recommendation list. Honestly, why is the narrator even unnamed? Perhaps it’s to show how her lack of individuality drove her to latch on to the validation of a man. She is defined solely by her husband and her complacency toward the murder of Rebecca. 
It’s not the most feminist novel for a particularly feminist audience. For that reason and that reason alone, I can’t like “Rebecca” when it is not in relation to Taylor Swift. It is through her songs “tolerate it” and “no body, no crime” that I am able to reframe the abysmal narrative of the original novel and craft a more socially acceptable piece that promotes individuality, womanhood and ridding the world of a man who is willing to murder his wife on a whim. We don’t need that.
If you’re asking yourself: Does this really live rent free in your mind? Do you really spend hours thinking about books and Taylor Swift instead of writing your philosophy paper? Like a diary that spews out unfiltered thoughts and can perfectly craft narratives of your day-to-day life, to those questions I say, yes. What is life without a constant diary entry going on in your head, mapping out a world where all the things you love exist in one fandom? 
It’s almost unacceptable if I didn’t end this column like you would a diary entry. From me and my rewritten “Rebecca” ending, sincerely yours, Myriam.

There is a huge sense of pride and joy that comes with the Olympics. This year’s winter games in Beijing created moments that resonate with so many fans — Shaun White’s last Olympic run, Eileen Gu’s gold medal games and Erin Jackson becoming the first Black woman to medal — not just that, a gold medal — in speed skating.
The Olympics aren’t always fun and games, pun intended. They have often stirred political unrest and as we have seen recently, a doping scandal. 
15-year-old Russian figure skater and gold medal favorite Kamila Valieva tested positive for trimetazidine, a banned heart medication, on Feb. 7. Two days after the positive test came to light, and only one day before the individual women’s short program on Feb. 15, The Court of Arbitration for Sport released a statement allowing Valieva to continue to skate. 
So why was she allowed to skate? The panel concluded that Valieva was not responsible for the delay in results from the lab that tested her sample, which took 44 days to process. It was taken on Dec. 25 for the Russian National Championships and was not flagged for a positive result until Feb. 7. 
People on TikTok were not happy with this decision because the story sounded very similar to the drug scandal of the summer Olympics when United States sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson tested positive for marijuana in her system. 
This story did not have the same outcome as Valieva’s (who ended up placing fourth in the women’s long program skate). Richardson was suspended for a month and effectively disqualified from competing in the Summer Olympics because of her positive test. 
Richardson herself expressed her own frustration with the International Olympic Committee, tweeting:
“Can we get a solid answer on the difference between her situation and mine? My mother died and I can’t run and was also favored to place top 3. The only difference I see is I’m a young black lady.”
Especially since THC isn’t considered a performance-enhancing drug and trimetazidine is. While it is no secret that race may have had a huge part in the decision of these situations, in fact there are quite a few factors at play that led to the rulings. 
For wstarters, in Richardson’s case the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency banned her from competing, not the IOC. Even though the World Anti-Doping Agency does consider marijuana a banned substance, if the IOC had the chance to take a look at Richarson’s case, like they did Valieva’s, she might not have been banned.
Secondly, Valieva is only 15 years old. In her doping scandal, her being a minor had a lot to do with the result of the case. The Russian figure skating world has a reputation of being extremely intense and putting an immense amount of pressure on their athletes to win no matter what. Behind closed doors, we have no idea what Russian figure skating coaches are forcing their athletes to do and the potential abuse that is happening. 
In an interview with “National Public Radio,” former Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon said:
“Valieva is 15. I doubt very much she knowingly doped. She’s a minor. The adults completely failed her.”
Yes, these cases are different, and the points of Valieva being a minor are completely warranted. However, there are definitely double standards and white privilege at play. TikTok has been a tool in uncovering these problems and perspectives.  
@mr.jahko perfectly summed up the anger that so many other Black Tiktokers were expressing about this case:
“So we barely made it to the third week of Black History Month and I’m already fired up with the foolishness … Just call it what it is, it’s white privilege … Remember how a year ago they didn’t let Sha’Carri Richardson compete in the Olympics because she had a positive drug test, but ya’ll could let Kamila compete. I told ya’ll this was more than the drugs.”
TikToker @consiciouslee explained it best when summarizing the comparison of Richardson and Valieva’s scandals:
“My papa used to always say … they protection is in they complexion.”
Both Richardson’s and Valieva’s cases and the discussions that are taking place on TikTok bring to light that there is a dark history behind the Olympics. There is blatant racism, there is minor abuse and threats to host cities. The IOC needs to look at what is happening behind the scenes of these competitions and reevaluate what is considered a true threat to the integrity of the games. A dose of marijuana in one’s system is but a small offense when compared to the adult coaches that see athletes as nothing but pawns, not people, in the quest to win gold for their countries.

No matter the state of the world, who wouldn’t give anything to have someone say to them that they’ll never leave, and to love them even when things turn difficult? These rosy declarations are some of the first words heard — or in this case, sung — in director Joe Wright’s newest film “Cyrano,” MGM’s grand musical-drama based on Edmond Rostand’s 1897 play “Cyrano de Bergerac.” It’s a romantic tale indulgent in dramatic conceits galore: hopeless romanticism, sword fights and a whole lot of poetry.
Seasoned thespian Peter Dinklage stars as the tormented Cyrano, a witty sword-wielding poet who believes he is doomed to love the beautiful Roxanne (Haley Bennett) from afar because of his appearance — one he feels no wig or noble title could ever make desirable. When his true love has her head turned by the handsome Christian (Kevin Harrison Jr.), an opportunity arises. Christian boasts every attribute Cyrano doesn’t have, except one: poetics. Given Christian cannot find the words to woo Roxanne, he turns to Cyrano to compose love letters to the strong-willed damsel, who will settle for nothing less than true love. Before the imminent war calls for duty, Cyrano is given one last chance to confess his love to Roxanne without barriers.
“Cyrano” is a cinematic experience crafted for pure enjoyment. Rightfully, the film relinquishes nothing to justify its existence in the current film pantheon devoid of unapologetic, larger-than-life romance. It’s characteristic of Wright to push for such allure; his previous era-specific works, namely “Pride and Prejudice” and “Atonement,” have accumulated immense pop culture capital for their clever wit and romantic aesthetics. With “Cyrano,” he once again proves that if there is anything that he has mastered during his directorial career, it is the art of the period film.
The film explores the meaning of love beyond romance — it touches on friendship, military brotherhood and the acceptance of oneself. Some of its most powerful scenes deal with the cost of war, and having the chance to say goodbye to loved ones before the inevitable. It’s also packed with laughs. The actors — Dinklage especially — make choices to find humor in unexpected moments and the tense. Wright’s quirky, erotic humor also makes its usual appearance, most memorably in a scene where a love song and bread baking complement one another … sensually.
Considering Rostand’s play continues to be retold over a century later, a modern rendition only works to enhance its already timeless narrative. For one, dwarfism is addressed in a non-exploitative manner that signals a positive future on the screen for the community. Dinklage’s Cyrano is an image of the types of protagonists that viewers with dwarfism can imagine themselves as. It also relieves the stigma that dwarf actors have faced in the world of film and hopefully opens up more types of roles available to them in the future. There’s also a strong female-led narrative; instead of Roxanne being subjected to an overbearing duel of possession between Christian and Cyrano, she exercises agency by deciding what she wants for herself. Love is not her weakness — it is the source of her power.
Perhaps the film’s most powerful narrative attribute is that it’s also a musical — or rather, “a film with songs,” Dinklage said. It’s an accurate description; it certainly lacks the feel of the Broadway musical adaptations that have fallen out of vogue in recent years and tend to be met with disdain from viewers who passionately dislike musicals. The film is adorned with an original score composed by Aaron and Bryce Dessner of rock band The National. Instead of flashy theatrical melodies, the Dessner brothers instead opt for their trademark folk softness mixed with a regal, classical sensibility. There’s also an original catalog of songs penned by Matt Berrninger and Carin Besser that are Cyrano’s true poetry. The human touch of its lyrics, with songs like “Someone To Say,” supplement the story with the complexity it needs. The music is much more than an accompaniment — it is very well the soul of the film.
There’s a noticeable regard for craftsmanship through Wright’s precise direction and aesthetic appreciation. The medium of film is on “Cyrano”’s side, with its powder-puffed and blushed visual design that delectably beautifies every inch of the big screen. There’s candlelit theatrical sets and airy Italian exteriors where a company of dancers float gracefully to the sweeps of regal melodies. The choreography is complimented by an ensemble of costumes designed by Massimo Cantini Parrini, whose work for the film garnered a nomination for Best Costume Design at this year’s Academy Awards.
“Cyrano” is a simple tale, but it’s a courageous one. It’s a breath of fresh air in a Hollywood where romance films are either formulaic direct-to-streaming vessels that exist solely for viewership or lightweight theatrical releases that have fallen into complete irrelevance in favor of more “serious” filmmaking. It shows once again that romance makes for great entertainment if you indulge in it. Not only that, it’s a tender story about the human condition that understands at the end of the day that the need to be loved is undeniable.
“Cyrano” comes out only in theaters Feb. 25.

The necessity of emotional support animals has often been questioned but, statistics on mental health in college students provide some background on their crucial role. Nearly 44% of college students have symptoms of depression or anxiety and 30% of students have reported feelings of depression in the past year, according to Mayo Clinic.  
As stated by a study conducted by NCBI, “Most mental health disorders have their peak onset during young adulthood,” which is right around one’s college years. Surveys conducted by the American College Health Association showed that more than half of the respondents, who were college students, suffered from anxiety, and almost half experienced nearly debilitating depression. It is no consolation that universities do not have a proportionate amount of counselors on staff to assist struggling students. 
The mental health of college students is an ongoing crisis that many schools struggle with. Luckily, animals “can help people manage their long-term mental health conditions” and provide people with an element of emotional security. When humans spend time with animals, their levels of cortisol, the “primary stress hormone,” decrease, as do feelings of loneliness. Despite research that shows the depth of mental health struggles in college students and the potential alleviation of these symptoms offered by animals, getting an emotional support animal approved in college is difficult. Emotional support animals are not legally viewed as service animals under Title I and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, a mental illness has the potential to be “considered a disability by the Social Security Administration,” and yet, the process to obtain listing an emotional support animal as a service animal is not as simple as just getting a doctor’s note regarding your mental status.
Psychology Today describes emotional support animals as an important tool in a student’s mental health treatment, but colleges are increasingly concerned with fraudulent requests for such animals, making the process more difficult and less common.
In California, a connection with a mental health provider for 30 days is required before having the ability to receive the documentation that could lead to the approval of an emotional support animal. This can create time and financial constraints for students. Not everyone has the ability to wait a month before receiving necessary support, and mental health providers and services are notoriously expensive, thus less accessible.
USC characterizes emotional support animals as assistance animals and states that since they are not service animals, they are “generally considered a housing-related accommodation.” The USC Office of Student Accessibility Services encourages students who want to bring an assistance animal to campus “to initiate this process well in advance of the housing request and placement process to allow for the complete file review process prior to housing arrangements being finalized,” which implies that it is a long-winded road to receive approval. 
USC does not have a separate department that deals with requests for assistance animals within OSAS. The creation of such a department that handles these cases in a one-on-one, discussion-based framework would make students feel more comfortable presenting their requests and will allow the approval process to go more smoothly. 
This department would lessen the stigma associated with emotional support animals. The process can be overwhelming, and having resources where one could be walked through the process would alleviate unnecessary stress. It could direct students to mental health professionals who do not financially burden them, as well as provide financial packages one could use for animal care. 
Emotional support animals are sometimes viewed as glorified pets that get unfair special treatment by institutions such as universities. ESADoctors.com, a blog dedicated to education on the topic, states that, “An emotional support animal is a doctor-ordered treatment, just like medication and talk therapy.” A 2018 research conducted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information showcases that dogs, for example, had the ability to decrease feelings such as depression and loneliness in veterans suffering from PTSD. In fact, the dogs even increased feelings of calmness. As stated in the research study, “Pets were able to provide unique emotional support as a result of their ability to respond to their owners in an intuitive way, especially in times of crisis and periods of active symptoms.”
Universities and colleges across the United States have an implicit obligation to their students to ensure their emotional needs are being met. In a time of communal struggle, this has never been more true. Emotional support animals are a valid tool for increasing the mental health of students in need, and there needs to be a concerted effort to make these animals more accessible as well as less stigmatized.

My day started with a Zoom work training session. It was at 10 a.m., but waking up was harder than I anticipated. The previous night, I had a glass of white wine like I do most nights to fall asleep. 
I woke up 20 minutes before the Zoom — not enough time to drink my Trader Joe’s matcha latte, so I made do with the mountain of chocolates surrounding the pile of books and array of random objects on my desk. 
There was nothing truly special about the training, except I mispronounced one of my Indian coworker’s names. I am Indian, so this was embarrassing to say the least. I tried to act cool and relatable by recommending the TV show “The Woman in the House Across the Street from the Girl in the Window,” because it was the latest trending thing I had binge-watched last weekend. 
If you’re wondering what that has to do with anything, there’s a reason behind all these random, minute, atomic details of my life — don’t worry it’ll all make sense later. 
That weekend I had a documentary shoot plus editing, a short film shoot, a short film script, four papers, my journalism capstone work, internship applications, never-ending existential dread and this column to write. I also needed to finish work for my one of two jobs, do travel bookings and attend social plans. 
All of this needed to be done over a single weekend, because girlbosses pile on additional projects each week and only come up for air every two weeks or so. 
So how did I end up with a broken toe, a missing shoe and little will to live? Let me start from the beginning. 
It started with a walk. But, next thing I knew, the walk turned into a run. I was running for my life. It was like my deadlines and work commitments were chasing me but deadlier. I was being chased by a large bear — as if UCLA’s mascot was exacting revenge for its basketball loss to USC. Not sure why I was the target chosen, but I kept running on the streets of Figueroa and pushing past people. 
Sweating profusely with my heart racing faster than my approaching deadlines, I woke up. Yeah, this was a dream. Did you think I would be chased on Fig by a UCLA mascot and not make it on Barstool or the USC Meme page? 
Freshly reminded of my deadlines, it was time for Dulce’s blueberry matcha latte to fuel me (no, they are not sponsoring this column, but their matcha is the last thing holding the threads of my sanity together).
Pay attention, because the dream will play an essential role in piecing together what all of this means. 
During my 15-minute walk to USC Village, I analyzed my dream. What did it truly mean? Why was the Bruin mascot chasing me? Was this the spot in the pavement I tripped and came crashing down on? Was I overthinking? When your brain is constantly going over 100 miles an hour, it is hard to know when you’re overthinking versus when you’re thinking just the right amount. Who decides that anyway? 
Standing in the trenches for my matcha separated by a long queue of people hungry for the serotonin only Dulce can provide, I started planning my schedule. As a girlboss, overthinking, overplanning and overcommitment become your arsenals for carrying out the impossible. 
If you’re confused about the point this column is trying to make and where it’s going, trust me, it’ll all make sense toward the end. I know what I’m doing, and if you don’t see the big picture yet, maybe satire isn’t for you. 
Recharged, refueled and ready to take on the world — nothing could get in my way, or so I thought. The events of the day would take on a new meaning. The broken toe, a reminder of a broken system where we constantly push ourselves. Ready for the reveal?  
Rounding into the present — it is Saturday morning and I am writing my column. I woke up at 7 a.m. to finish it since it was due the previous day. With an hour and a half to get it done because I am meeting my friends Downtown for brunch, I needed to come up with 600 words. 
Seven hundred and forty one words of me gaslighting you later, nothing about this column makes sense, and yet, here you are reading till the end … and that’s on gaslight, girlboss, gatekeep.
Here are some ways to avoid getting gaslighted:
1) Stop reading this column! I already admitted to gaslighting you and nothing I’ve said so far has made any sense. 
2) Seriously, stop. Why are you doing this to yourself? 
3) If you’re still reading, you need serious help: Don’t believe everything you’re told, especially if you have no reason to. 
4) If you’re being manipulated until your judgment is being questioned and reality doesn’t make sense — stop and do a headstand. Blood will rush to your brain, and you’ll think straight. 
5) You’re smart only until you think you’re not: Ignore any statements that place the blame on you. 
6) Avoid people who are good at cooking or know how to light a gas. More importantly, never ever try lighting one yourself unless it’s to burn the place down.   
Stay smart out there, besties! Don’t let people’s words suck you in.

Women’s basketball will play its final regular season games of the year against Arizona State Thursday and No. 12 Arizona Saturday. The Trojans will look to finish their regular season with momentum heading into the Pac-12 tournament, taking place March 2-6 in Las Vegas. 
Freshman guard Rayah Marshall and the Trojans are excited to take advantage of these games to get ready for the Pac-12 tournament.
“We’re looking to be able to see what we’re capable of and taking this game to prepare us for the future games,” said Marshall in an interview with the Daily Trojan. 
Marshall is looking to keep things rolling after recording back-to-back double doubles for the first time in her career last week against Utah and Colorado, earning her Pac-12 Freshman of the Week. Marshall recorded a career-high 18 points on 9 of 15 shooting in Friday’s 83-62 win over Utah. Among all the freshmen in the country, Marshall has the most blocks per game at 2.40. 
“They can count on me to get done whatever it is they are relying on me to do,” Marshall said. “Simply, if they need me to be an ear off the court, setting screens for them on the court, being able to move the ball.”
At 11-14 overall and 4-11 in conference play, the Trojans face a tough Arizona State team and a nationally ranked Arizona team to close out conference play. The Sun Devils are ninth in the Pac-12, while the Wildcats are fourth with a 9-5 conference record.
The Wildcats are looking to bounce back from a loss to an unranked Washington State team on Sunday. In the loss, senior forward Cate Reese was injured with a dislocated shoulder. The 6-foot-2 forward is the Wildcats’ leading scorer and rebounder on the team, averaging 14.6 points per game and 6.2 rebounds per game. 
The Trojans are going for the series sweep against the No. 12 Wildcats, previously upsetting them 76-67 Jan. 9 at Galen Center. Junior guard Alyson Miura led the team in scoring with 15 points, shooting 5 of 6 from deep and dishing out 6 assists. 
To prepare for the upcoming Arizona schools, Marshall emphasized “toughness.” 
“Both teams are really good teams, so we’re just looking to be the aggressors,” Marshall said. 
This is the Trojans’ first matchup with the Sun Devils because their previous game was postponed on Jan. 2 due to coronavirus protocols. 
With two wins against the Sun Devils and the Wildcats, the Trojans could move into ninth place in the Pac-12. As of now, the Trojans will end up seeding anywhere from a ninth seed to an 11th seed, which means they would need to win four games to be crowned Pac-12 tournament champions, securing them an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. However, Marshall isn’t worried about making the tournament. Instead, he just wants to finish the season strong.
“We’re focusing on just finishing strong, both on the court and mentally, and continually growing to be closer with each other,” Marshall said.
USC will close up the regular season at Arizona State Thursday at 4 p.m. and at Arizona Saturday at 11 a.m.

After beating UCLA to become National Champions back in May 2021, No. 1 USC women’s beach volleyball starts off its 2022 season against No. 15 Long Beach State. 
The Trojans are looking to continue their dominant performance from last season, with eight of their 10 starters returning this season, and the addition of two graduate transfers — Caroline Schafer from Cal and Sunny Villapando from Stanford. Also returning to the team is two-time Pac-12 Player of the Year and fourth place Olympian, senior Tina Graudina, 2021 Pac-12 Freshman of the Year, sophomore Megan Kraft and AVCA All-Americans and graduate students Julia Scoles and Sammy Slater.
Despite last season’s success, the Trojans are dedicated to opening the season with a clean slate. 
“You climbed the mountain [last year], and then, you have to climb it again,” Head Coach Dain Blanton said. “The matches last year aren’t going to win us matches this year … We expect people to come at us, so we want to flip it on them. We are the predators going after them.”
The Trojans ranked first in the 2022 AVCA preseason coaches poll, a full 16 points ahead of crosstown rival and 2021 Pac-12 Champion UCLA.
“Anyone who is a defending champion has a target on their back,” said Scoles, one of this year’s captains. “Last year really means nothing. We handled business last year, but now it’s time to go out and prove it once more.”
Many Trojans returned for an extra year due to the eligibility extension following the coronavirus pandemic. 
“We can share our experiences, and set the culture for, hopefully, years to come,” Scoles said. “It’s such a cool opportunity to be here that extra year to help lead this program forward.”
Those around the beach volleyball team this year look to cement its place as a historic program. 
“A lot of the girls having this extra year realize how special it is,” Blanton said. “That’s what we are trying to do: create a legacy here … When people think about collegiate beach volleyball, the first name they think of is USC.”
With many veterans returning, younger teammates have the opportunity to learn from the experienced figures of the team.
“We have great leadership,” sophomore Delaynie Maple said. “It’s only helping the program. Next year, whoever the captains are, we have so many people to learn from, it’s only going to help the trajectory of not only the season but also the program in general.”
Looking ahead to their match against Long Beach State, the Trojans will focus on their own play, regardless of the Elbees’ strategy.
“We are trying not to think too much about what they are doing, but more about what we are doing,” Maple said. “Just focusing on our side and focusing on our defense … We have been training so hard, and I’m excited to see everything we’ve been working on go into play. I only have confidence in our team, but it’s also exciting and jittery.”
Blanton said he recognized the group’s stature ahead of the season’s start. 
“It’s a special group,” Blanton said. “They’re motivated, and they work extremely hard … They know what they are capable of doing. It’s a matter of going out and executing it every time, and proving every time that you are the best.”

Lars Nootbaar has always flown under the radar. 
Maybe this is because of his professional baseball career’s humble beginnings when he was selected in the eighth round of the 2018 MLB draft and 243rd overall by the St. Louis Cardinals. 
The players that have superstar potential are scooped up within the first  picks of the MLB draft. Everyone who is predicted as a future great is long gone before the 243rd pick rolls around. 
Except Nootbaar has always been a star and he hasn’t stopped stealing the spotlight. 
A star athlete since high school, Nootbaar played two sports at El Segundo High School and was a three-time league MVP in baseball and a two-time league MVP as the football team’s quarterback. 
Nootbaar then chose to further his baseball career at USC, where he played three seasons for the Trojans and was named to the All Pac-12 team as a sophomore. 
He had a solid minor league debut season in 2018, but his professional career really took off during the following year. Nootbaar played his way through three levels of the minor leagues in 2019, where he hit a very solid .264 with a .349 on base percentage across the three levels. 
Nootbaar’s career was put on hold in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. However, that didn’t stop the momentum he had built. Nootbaar started 2021 in Triple-A, the highest level of minor league baseball, where his superb .308 average caught the attention of the Cardinals’ coaching staff. He was called up on June 22. 
Nootbaar was in the majors, fittingly still repping the Cardinal and Gold with a team that wears “Cardinals” across its chest during home games. During the rest of the season, he settled into a role as the team’s fourth outfielder and even made the postseason roster for the Wild Card game against the Dodgers. 
So why didn’t the baseball world see this coming and draft him accordingly? Why was his draft outlook so poor even though he’s been a star on every team he has played on since high school? 
The answer is home runs. 
While Nootbaar has always been an outstanding defender and contact hitter, his power numbers have never been eye-popping. He only hit 14 home runs total in his three seasons at USC and only has 15 in his minor league career. 
The modern game of baseball is, unfortunately for Nootbaar, a game centered around the home run. Teams stack their rosters with power hitters who can run up the score with a single swing, and fans clamor to see home runs more than anything. 
Because of this, Nootbaar has gone unnoticed by fans who are focused on players who can hit more home runs. 
However, it’s not all bad news for Nootbaar.  For one thing, baseball games cannot be won on home runs alone. His defense and contact-hitting ability are valuable to any team, even if both skills have become underappreciated. 
For another, he may have found his home run swing. After the 2021 season, the Cardinals sent Nootbaar to the Arizona Fall League, a developmental league where he faced other top MLB prospects, where he enjoyed a fantastic fall season. Most notably, his home run rate was 5.7% — a  rate that, if sustained, would be better than MLB superstar Freddie Freeman’s rate in 2021. 
Nootbaar also has a flair for those who love drama. His first MLB home run was a pinch-hit, tie-breaking home run against the Pirates Aug. 12. On Sept. 15, he made a jumping catch to rob Pete Alonso of a homer and all but seal the game for St. Louis. 
He’s also one of the most fun and unique personalities in the game. He has a last name that is begging for a candy bar to be made with his namesake. He wears number 68, a very unique jersey number. He sticks his tongue out like Michael Jordan when he makes a dramatic defensive play. 
Because of all this, Nootbaar is already a fan-favorite amongst Cardinals fans, who have already started chanting “NOOT” whenever he makes a notable play. 
Don’t make the same mistake that MLB scouts did and miss out on the superstar play of the next great Trojan baseball alumnus. 
Nootbaar is poised for a breakout season in 2022. Take note. Or, take Noot.
