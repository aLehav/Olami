Norman Corwin, the “poet laureate of radio” and writer in residence at the Annenberg School for Communication & Journalism, died Tuesday. He was 101.
Corwin died of natural causes at 5 p.m., according to Annenberg.
“I’ve been at USC for 37 years; the entire experience has been my favorite memory,” Corwin told the Daily Trojan in 2010, at his 100th birthday celebration. “Teaching is my favorite achievement.”
Corwin had been an Annenberg faculty member since 1979, during his tenure he authored several books and wrote a monthly column about media.
Corwin began working as a print journalist when he was 17 years old but moved into radio after 10 years.
He wrote, directed and produced original radio plays for CBS in the late ’30s and ’40s, the golden age of radio. His programs aired uninterrupted by sponsors.
Corwin is noted for writing “On a Note of Triumph,” which marked the end of World War II and was the most listened-to radio drama in U.S. history, and “We Hold These Truths,” which he wrote after President Franklin Roosevelt asked him to write a program celebrating the Bill of Rights.
Corwin’s screenplay biography of artist Vincent van Gogh, Lust for Life, earned him an Academy Award nomination in 1956. He earned an Emmy, two Peabody medals and a Golden Globe award for his writing.
He also wrote and directed plays, television dramas and motion pictures. He chaired two award committees for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.
Corwin is survived by his two children.

The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously approved a senate resolution Tuesday to increase awareness among administrators and students for a new community service council.
USG hopes the Inter-Service Council will organize more campus-wide outreach events and strengthen dialogue between service groups.
The council was created earlier this semester as part of a student project for The Art and Adventure of Leadership, a course taught by President Emeritus Steven B. Sample and leadership expert Warren Bennis. Creating such an outreach council, attempted unsuccessfully in the past, was part of USG President Monish Tyagi and USG Vice President Logan Lachman’s campaign platform.
Service · Marissa Roy, a residential senator, and Edward Chau, a commuter senator, discussed a resolution that will create a new community service council. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
“[The council] could be a collective forum for any service ideas, be a funding resource and be a collaborative resource,” said USG Treasurer Elton Kwok, one of the council’s seven founders.
At least 15 service organizations, such as the Helenes and USC Dance Marathon, have already applied to be recognized members of the council. Applications are due in the Volunteer Center by Friday at 5 p.m.
Peony Khoo, who oversees two service organizations, Alpha Phi Omega and the Asian American Tutorial Project, said the council will provide necessary communication between student outreach groups.
“We hope that this council can facilitate collaboration between the organizations and enhance the overall impact that we can make,” Khoo said.
Residential Senator Marissa Roy, who co-authored the resolution, said the council has an opportunity to increase student involvement in community service. The resolution will particularly benefit students who have been turned away from organizations, such as Troy Camp and Helenes, who have acceptance rate of approximately 25 percent, according to Roy.
“We know there are a lot of students who don’t get involved in those organizations because they are so competitive and only so many spots [are available],” Roy said.
The council aims to increase involvement by marketing volunteer events to a greater number of people and providing students with a community service calendar, Kwok said.
Though the council currently falls under the jurisdiction of the Volunteer Center, there has been talk among USG officials about eventually incorporating the organization into USG.
“What happens in the future? A lot of that will be determined by the [council’s] new Executive Board,” said Speaker Pro Tempore and Residential Senator Vinnie Prasad, a co-author of the resolution.
Roy said the Inter-Service Council functions like other Program Board assemblies in that it brings together student organizations with similar goals. The most recent addition to Program Board was the Political Student Assembly in 2006. Prior to that, the assembly was part of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics, PSA Director Will Roper said.
The council’s founders will select its own executive board by the end of the semester, Prasad said. It will comprise representatives from the council’s recognized member organizations.
“The hope and goal is for student government to take part and take this organization into their hands,” Kwok said.
Kwok said putting the council under USG’s jurisdiction could provide faster access to funding. Roy said, however, the council will not likely be incorporated during the current administration because USG funding is fixed for the year.
“I don’t think any action will be taken this year,” Roy said. “It would be really hard to add a [Program Board] assembly at this point.”
The resolution also calls for a USG representative to attend Inter-Service Council meetings and work with the executive board to offer the new organization advice and assistance.
“We definitely want the two organizations to be close,” Roy said. “We want to support them as they start because USG really believes in this cause.”
Prasad and Roy emphasized the importance of raising awareness of the council, particularly among the administration.
“We were also trying to tie in the goals and the vision of this council to the goals and the vision of [President C. L. Max Nikias’] presidency and administration,” Prasad said. “He’s made serving and working with the surrounding community a primary goal and that’s exactly what this is about.”
USG Secretary Stephanie Lam will email the resolution to five administrative offices affected by the council: Office of the President, Office of the Provost, Office of Student Affairs, Office of Campus Affairs and Office of the Volunteer Center.
The resolution directs Prasad and Roy to work with these offices in an effort to find an administrator willing to serve as an adviser for the council.

Joint Educational Project staff, students and programs will temporarily vacate their current location in the JEP House on Friday.
In the next nine months, the house’s interior will be remodeled to increase space for the programs.
Moving · JEP’s offices have been located in the JEP House on West 34th Street since 1976. Renovations are expected to last nine months. - Chris Roman | Daily Trojan
Plans to move forward with the project are contingent upon approval from contractors.
Security and plumbing will also be upgraded and modernized. A new basement, as well as additional office space, bathrooms and central air conditioning will be added.
The JEP staff and its offices will move to The Lot, located on Downey Way, for the duration of the construction, which is expected to last less than a year, according to Tammara Anderson, executive director of JEP.
The renovations will enhance the programs JEP offers, Anderson said.
“The renovations will be great for the staff,” Anderson said. “It’s time to bring it up to date.”
After the contractor approves the project, JEP will seek permission from the administration to begin construction, according to Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences architect Jim McElwain of  the American Institute of Architects.
JEP is not fully funded, and if plans are not approved, the relocation and renovations might be canceled, according to McElwain. The renovations will be partially funded by the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and by the Office of President C. L. Max Nikias.
Each semester more than 1,200 undergraduate students volunteer to provide educational and outreach services to members of the local community. JEP seeks to expose students to the environment around campus to facilitate service-learning projects and intellectual growth. JEP has been housed at its current location on West 34th Street since 1976.
Filled with a rich history and iconic presence on campus, the JEP House’s exterior will not change, so as to preserve its historical roots and tradition.
“We have to make sure the house stays the same on the outside,” Anderson said. “We have had a long successful program with community partnerships and student involvement.”
Anderson hopes the modifications to the house will attract more participants.
“Initially [the renovations] may help with participation because people want to see and be engaged in what’s new,” Anderson said. “It will call attention to the work that we do.”
Marguerite Bowen, a junior majoring in business administration and Spanish, said a renovated JEP House would reflect the work JEP volunteers do with the community.
“It is such a great thing that will benefit a lot of great people who have done great things for others,” Bowen said.

It came as a surprise to many — most everyone, in fact.
Just one game removed from passing for a single-game school record 468 yards against Arizona, junior quarterback Matt Barkley and the rest of the Trojans’ offense visibly struggled at California last Thursday.
Barkley finished just 19-of-35 for 195 passing yards — his lowest output through the air all year for the Trojans. He did, however, throw two  touchdowns against the Golden Bears.
Just off · Sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods finished with a season-low five catches for 36 yards and no touchdowns at California. The second-year wideout has 60 receptions for 783 and six touchdowns on the year. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Despite winning the game 30-9, USC understands it has a lot of work to do before facing Notre Dame on Saturday in South Bend, Ind., in what will be the first night game at Notre Dame Stadium since a 1990 game against Michigan.
“We’re going to get ready for everything, whether it’s press [coverage] or off [coverage],” sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods said. “We [have to] be ready for whatever they throw at us.”
On the season, the Trojans average almost 300 yards per game through the air, and Barkley remains among the nation’s leaders in touchdown passes, as well as passing yards.
The rather ho-hum performance against Cal came as a surprise to everyone, including Barkley.
In the moments following the game, Barkley and Woods noted it wasn’t so much the scheme Cal employed that stifled the offense. It was USC’s own offensive miscues that threw it off in San Francisco.
“When it comes down to it, I don’t think it comes down to what they showed us,” Barkley said in the aftermath. “It’s us not making plays tonight, especially myself. Just little things were off.”
The lack of an explosive passing game has to be disconcerting — at least to some degree — for the Trojans, given on the season they average just more than 133 yards per game on the ground, which ranks 77th in the country.
Woods also noted the offense’s lack of firepower was self-inflicted and just seemed a bit “off” on the night.
“I’m not really sure [what happened],” Woods said after practice Sunday. “It was just a lot of timing, [being] slightly off. We just got to get better. They ran a Cover 2, but I was behind the secondary a lot, so it wasn’t anything that they were doing.”
The players understand the offensive game — not just the passing game — will need to be clicking on all cylinders against the Fighting Irish.
“[We need to be] consistent and get the timing down with no turnovers,” Woods said. “We had one last week. And [we need to] keep getting turnovers on defense.”
Notre Dame does present a few challenges of its own.
The Irish defense gives up just a 58 percent completion percentage to opposing quarterbacks and allows 21 points per game. The Trojans, however, might be without the services of freshman wide receiver Marqise Lee, who suffered a shoulder injury against the Golden Bears.
Lee, who has emerged as a consistent offensive weapon alongside Woods, finished with 81 yards receiving and a touchdown before leaving the game Thursday.
If the 6-foot wideout, who has four touchdown catches this season, is unable to play, senior wide receiver Brandon Carswell, who caught his first touchdown of the year against California, is expected to fill his spot. Junior wide receiver Brice Butler could also see playing time.
No matter who lines up next to him, Woods hopes to have a better game than he did last week, where he only caught five passes for 36 yards.
On the season, Woods is fifth in the country in receiving yards (783) and averages just more than 130 receiving yards per game.
The game against Notre Dame begins a tough stretch for the Trojans, as they will face Stanford, Colorado, Washington and Oregon in the coming weeks.
Woods, however, is looking forward to the challenges that lie in South Bend, hostile crowd and all.
“I’m excited,” Woods said. “First Notre Dame game in South Bend, first night game in I think 22 years. It’s going to be a big one.”
Did you read the article? Lee isnt playing most likely. Even if he is he will be far from 100%
He will be shut out when we double him.
No Problem, Marqise Lee is on the other side to catch plenty of footballs.

Rivalries make college football special.
Coaches, players and fans alike circle one or two games on their calendar each year as “must-win” games — not because of rankings or standings, but out of a longstanding and passionate dislike for another school. For some, it would be OK if their team lost every other game if only they beat that school.
The names really say it all. Every year, Pittsburgh and West Virginia throw down in the Backyard Brawl. Utah and BYU wage an annual Holy War. Georgia and Georgia Tech engage in Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate.
Whether between teams in the same conference, the same state or even the same city, almost all of college football’s rivalries share a common bond: They make geographic sense.
USC’s rivalry with Notre Dame stands out because of how seemingly random it is: 2,103 miles separate Notre Dame Stadium from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The teams have never played in the same conference — Notre Dame football has seen no need for conference affiliation at all. What then does a Catholic school of fewer than 12,000 students in northern Indiana have in common with a secular institution of 36,000 grads and undergrads in the heart of the nation’s second-largest media market?
The origin of the rivalry is equally odd. Gwynn Wilson, USC’s equivalent to an athletic director in 1925, went with his wife to Lincoln, Neb., in November of that year to spend Thanksgiving watching Notre Dame play the Nebraska Cornhuskers.
The Trojans themselves were in the midst of an 11-2 season in which they played all but one game at the Coliseum and were searching for a more nationally prominent rival. The Fighting Irish were a prime candidate, having gone undefeated the previous season, which was capped off by a 27-10 victory over Stanford in the 1925 Rose Bowl.
At this point, the line between truth and fiction begins to blur. Legendary Notre Dame coach Knute Rockne — whose life inspired the movie Knute Rockne, All American, starring, among others, Ronald Reagan — is said to have been reluctant to agree to an annual series with the Trojans because of the long-distance travel required.
That’s when the women stepped in. Wilson’s wife got to chatting with Rockne’s wife and convinced her that a biannual trip to the sunny West Coast was an improvement upon the usual pilgrimage to freezing Nebraska.
Naturally, Rockne was convinced by his wife, and the teams squared off for the first time ever in Los Angeles the following December. This Saturday the Trojans and Irish will play for the 83rd time in their history.
It’s not just the distance between the schools, however, that makes the series unique. Notre Dame fills its schedule each year with games against teams from coast to coast because it doesn’t belong to a conference.
In the 1980s, for example, the Trojans’ were far from the Irish’s most fearsome opponents. USC didn’t win a single game against Notre Dame from 1983 through 1995. Meanwhile, the Irish went to nine major bowl games during that span and won the 1988 national title.
The games Notre Dame fans most looked forward to then were the team’s showdowns with the Miami Hurricanes, which reached their dramatic peak in the 1988 game dubbed “Catholics vs. Convicts,” featuring a pre-game brawl between the teams. The series was called off two years later, however, and was only renewed again last year in the Sun Bowl.
The longevity of the USC-Notre Dame series, along with its prominence on the national stage, is what sets it apart.
The two programs have won a combined 22 national championships (11 each) and 14 Heisman trophies (seven each). They’ve had more players drafted into the NFL (USC is first with 472, Notre Dame second with 469) than any other school. Both are in the top eight in all-time winning percentage.
The series has produced some of the best moments in the history of college football.
Notre Dame fans fondly recall the 1988 game in which the No. 1 Irish beat the No. 2 Trojans 27-10 in Los Angeles on their way to the program’s last national championship.
The 1977 “Green Jersey Game” is also a happy memory for the Golden Domers. That year Notre Dame wore its traditional blue uniforms during warmups before switching clothes and charging out of the tunnel in special green jerseys followed by a giant Trojan horse. Led by quarterback Joe Montana, the Irish won 49-19.
USC supporters can claim “The Comeback” from 1974, in which the Trojans trailed 24-0 with 10 seconds remaining in the first half and rallied to win 55-24. Running back Anthony Davis scored four of his 11 career touchdowns against Notre Dame in that game.
More recently, Matt Leinart converted a 4th-and-9 pass to Dwayne Jarrett at Notre Dame Stadium in 2005 on the Trojans’ dramatic late drive. Leinart won the game with a one-yard quarterback sneak on the famous “Bush Push” play, giving the Trojans a 34-31 victory.
It’s moments like those that make USC and Notre Dame’s rivalry stand out as truly special.

Well written article. The only thing I would quibble with is the assertion that the Miami games meant more to us than those with USC. The games with Miami during that period meant more in the polls, but no game ever matters more to us than the SC game. Go Irish!
Having seen many of the games at both locations, I would add that there is a mutual respect between the schools, or at least a cordial atmosphere.  GO IRISH

Though tens of thousands of fans decked in cardinal and gold flock to every home football game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, USC’s 20 other NCAA varsity sports, many of which are highly ranked, don’t enjoy the same support from most fans.
The Trojan Fever Loyalty Program, which launched this fall in an effort to increase attendance at USC sporting events, could be the change these sports and their athletes are looking for.
In the bleachers · USC students can earn 10 to 40 points by attending select football, men’s basketball and women’s soccer games, among others. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
The initiative, developed by James Slagle, a graduate intern for the USC Athletic Marketing Department, allows students to earn points and win prizes each time they attend USC football, men’s and women’s basketball, women’s volleyball, women’s soccer and select men’s water polo home games. Prizes for the most loyal Trojan fans have included airline vouchers, Trojan apparel and tickets for last week’s USC-California football game held in San Francisco at AT&T Park.
Despite the latest push, many students remain unaware of the program’s existence.
Other than the video board ads at home football games, emails and word-of-mouth among certain student groups such as the Interfraternity Council, the program, which officially launched Sept. 3 when USC football hosted Minnesota, hasn’t reached most USC students.
“I hope it grows a lot more so we don’t have to market it as much and everyone wants to participate in it,” said IFC Council Vice President of Athletics Sam Megowen, who has been assisting Slagle in marketing the program to Greeks. “Getting it across campus is the hardest part.”
Despite the challenges, Slagle hopes the program can help make students more aware of the number of highly competitive teams USC boasts.
“Our school has the third most [NCAA] championships of all time and we’re in the midst of a great athletic stretch,” Slagle said. “Currently several of our teams have multiple national championship streaks and many more are gearing up for great seasons ahead.  We hope this program makes our home sporting events more exciting and gives our Trojans athletic teams a greater home-field advantage.”
There are 20 events before the end of the semester, which concludes with a Dec. 13 women’s basketball game against UC Santa Barbara.
When students attend games, they either swipe their student ID cards or sign in to earn points for their attendance.  There is no official procedure to sign up for the program. Rather, all students who attend a sporting event that gives them points are automatically enrolled in the program and have a chance to appear on a leaderboard on the Trojan Fever website that lists the top 50 point-earners.
The current point leader is Andrew Heiderscheit, a junior majoring in computer engineering and computer science, and uses the alias “BearFighter” on the leaderboard. Heiderscheit has amassed 330 points this semester. He thinks the incentive program is a good way to get students into the stands.
“That [the Trojan Fever Loyalty Program] exists is the first step to getting these sports exposed to the student body,” Heiderscheit said. “I definitely see that there are a lot more students at games. It used to be that there are 10 students and parents at women’s soccer, and now there is a block of students there. It’ll be interesting to see what happens when basketball rolls around, too.”
Heiderscheit hopes improved attendance can help provide USC athletic teams with more of a home-field advantage in the coming years.
“There are two main reasons I go to all these events,” he said. “The first is that I love all sports and they are exciting and entertaining to watch. The second is that I love to support the Trojan Family and anything I can do to help out is great.”
Trojan Fever also plans to launch similar programs geared specifically toward USC’s Greek population and campus residence halls.
Students can find more information on the Trojan Fever Loyalty Program at USCTrojans.com/trojanfever or by emailing trojanfever@usc.edu.
On Saturday, November 29 at 2:30, fans need to come support the men’s water polo team at the McDonald Swim Center in its match against Stanford before the football game…this year could be historic with USC going for a fourth straight NCAA title… something no team has ever done.  Let’s pack the stands with Trojans!
I agree with Steve ^ .  Let us swipe our Alumni Association cards and get some swag or ticket discounts, too!
What about the alumni including myself who go to a number of other sports besides football especially women’s during the athletic year to have some incentive?

Of the previous 72 meetings between USC and Notre Dame, at least one team has been ranked in the Associated Press top-25 poll all but nine times.
This season marks the 10th time.
Wide-eyed · Junior quarterback Matt Barkley, pictured here as a freshman against Notre Dame on Oct. 17, 2009, is 1-0 as a starter against the Irish. He missed last year’s edition of the rivalry because of a high ankle sprain. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
Though the Trojans and Fighting Irish have compiled a combined nine wins this season — against three losses — both finished outside the top-25 poll this week, receiving 107 and 87 votes, respectively, in what would equate to No. 27 and No. 28 in the poll.
It marks the first time in the history of the poll that a 5-1 Trojans team has not been ranked.
Despite USC’s postseason ineligibility and Notre Dame’s two losses, the game will still continue to hold plenty of value for many.
“It means a lot to the school, alumni and people here,” junior quarterback Matt Barkley said following Tuesday’s early morning practice. “To us, it is just another game that we have to win.”
Last week at California, Barkley passed for 195 yards and two touchdowns. Saturday’s contest against the Irish will mark Barkley’s second visit to South Bend, Ind.
As a freshman, Barkley completed 19 of 29 passes against the Fighting Irish, throwing for two touchdowns and one interception.
He did not, however, play in last season’s game because of a high ankle sprain sustained the week before in a 36-7 loss at Oregon State.
“I remember it being electric and not hostile like Autzen [Stadium] or [Ohio State’s] Horseshoe,” Barkley said. “It is a classic stadium that gets me fired up and it probably will for the other guys, too.”
Senior linebacker Chris Galippo noted that familiarity also makes Saturday’s showdown all the more unique.
“Most everybody on this team was recruited by Notre Dame,” Galippo said.
Last November, the Irish defeated the Trojans 20-16 at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
But until last season’s meeting, USC had won eight straight games over Notre Dame, dating back to 2002 — Pete Carroll’s second season as the team’s coach.
“So many coaches and players work over the years to start the streak and keep it going,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “When you’re playing a game without your quarterback, you hate to lose a streak when all of your guys aren’t there.”
Kiffin noted that it was difficult to watch game film from last year’s loss to Notre Dame.
“I don’t think it will ever leave,” Kiffin said of the defeat. “This week brings it back because you have to watch it again and learn from the tape.”

Junior tailback Curtis McNeal was USC’s leading rusher against Cal last week with 86 yards on 17 carries. He hopes the team’s strong play carries over this weekend as well.
“It’s a big game,” McNeal said. “They beat us last year, but we’re on a roll and we have to keep it going.”
McNeal is listed as the starter on the depth chart along with senior tailback Marc Tyler, who suffered a dislocated shoulder against Cal. It is unknown whether Tyler will be healthy enough to play against Notre Dame.
—
On Sunday and Tuesday, Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Robert Woods worked on their accuracy after having noticeable issues with timing against Cal.
Woods believes he was not affected by his performance last week.
“We still got the win by a good margin against Cal,” he said. “I just have to be ready for Notre Dame.”
—
The Trojans were pleased with their victory against the Bears and hope to repeat their performance this Saturday.
“The offense did a great job in controlling the ball and not turning it over,” Barkley said. “Although we had to settle for some field goals, we are putting points up on the board and that’s what matters to us.”
Lame Kiffin failed to mention that ND was without our starting QB, RB, and TE. Someone needs to accept that his team didnt play well enough to beat the Irish. Oh, by the way, were healthy this week.

This time last year, the Daily Trojan wrote “Craft beer comes to City of Angels,” an article that cited a wave of gastropubs, alehouses, breweries and taverns that had sprouted up around the city.
In the 12 short months since, the number of beer-loving establishments has grown even larger and our former flavorful-brew no man’s land is overflowing with specialty taps. But how does one determine which places are worth the trek when anyone with the right distributor account can get a keg of Stone IPA? One difference lies in the food. And in Los Angeles, it’s all about the burger.
In honor of the third annual L.A. Beer Week, which ends Sunday, here’s a list of establishments that feature both of America’s beloved pastimes — burgers and beer. Some have been on the lips of foodies and beer geeks for a while. Others are farther off the radar. All are worth a try, especially if that Natty Light isn’t cutting it anymore.
Father’s Office 
1018 Montana Ave., Santa Monica
3229 Helms Ave., Los Angeles
It’s fair to say Father’s Office invented the art of pairing burgers and beer. In fact, owner and head chef Sang Yoon’s gourmet, un-customizable burger has been credited with igniting a nationwide burger craze.
But these wood-paneled wonderlands are more than just their cooked-rare, dry-aged beef burger. As one of the first bars in Los Angeles to carry craft beer, F.O. more than lives up to its reputation for beer excellence. In addition to 26 taps — the number is doubled at its expanded second location in Culver City — that consistently rotate through rare local, national and international beers, there is an imposing bottle list full of brews, all of which contain as much flavor and craft as the spot’s famous burger.
Blue Palms Brewhouse
6124 Hollywood Blvd., Los Angeles
The restaurant-and-bar space attached to the Henry Fonda Music Box in Hollywood wasn’t much to speak of until Brian Lenzo turned it into the Blue Palms Brewhouse more than three years ago.
That’s when the owner and craft-beer lover decided to serve his brews like wine by pairing flavors from an upscale pub menu to complement brews flowing from the 24 taps. Local breweries love Lenzo, too, so the draft selection is always top notch (think: Ballast Point’s Habanero Sculipin on cask), and kegs blow daily, so eating the $12 blue cheese and fois gras truffle burger is a new experience every time.
The Golden State 
426 N. Fairfax Ave., Los Angeles
Staring across the street at the much-loved Canter’s Deli on Fairfax is The Golden State, a small burger-and-beer joint that represents a new breed of L.A. cafe. In an attempt to showcase the best in California food and drink, this counter-service eatery serves up its mouth-watering, maple-glazed, bacon burger — simply called “The Burger” — alongside a small number of rotating seasonal local beers from breweries such as Craftsman and Firestone.
This isn’t a place to sit for hours and get tipsy with your friends, but it is a great place to have a unique-tasting beer with your gourmet casual grub.
Beachwood BBQ and Brewing
210 E. 3rd St., Long Beach
Easily accessible from campus via the Metro’s Blue Line, Beachwood BBQ and Brewing in Downtown Long Beach is definitely worth the day trip. This expanded version of Seal Beach’s original beer-geek mecca features 24 guest taps of unparalleled exclusivity and an on-site brewery that supplies 12 more handles with solid house beers.
Owner and head chef Gabe Gordon left fine dining to open Beachwood in 2006, and though his restaurant is better known for its barbecue ribs and pulled pork, the half-pound smoked brisket and sirloin burger is a perfect match for any of the restaurant’s diverse draft offerings.
Mohawk Bend
2141 W. Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles
Mohawk Bend, in Echo Park, is the latest offshoot of entrepreneur Tony Yanow’s Burbank beer bar Tony’s Darts Away. For a new concept, Yanow converted an abandoned movie theater on Sunset Boulevard into a cavernous craft beer haven with three separate dining areas, two state-of-the art kitchens and 72 taps that exclusively host California beers, and pours cost no more than $6.
Though Mohawk’s seasonal vegan- and veggie-friendly menu has been drawing in the locals, it’s the over-the-top Dork Burger — made of duck, pork and Spanish chorizo — that somehow makes the excessive, home-state, draft love seem less gratuitous.
Congregation Ale House Chapters
201 E. Broadway Ave., Long Beach
619 N. Azusa Ave., Azusa
300 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena
In a little more than a year, this Long Beach-based tap house has expanded its reign to include a location in Azusa and one forthcoming this November in Pasadena. But don’t let the monastery theme or the Catholic schoolgirl outfits fool you — this place is serious about its burgers and beer. At only $8, the standard rib-eye and white cheddar burger is the best burger deal around, and the half-domestic, half-international draft philosophy means there is always something interesting to help wash it down.
Catch the place during happy hour, appropriately called “Mass,” and the burger is only $6. And if you’re willing to read through the impressive 150-deep bottle selection, there are more interesting tastes hiding in the house’s fridges.

When Australia banned the new Mortal Kombat video game in February for its excessive violence, the decision ignited debate over the function of violence in video games and whether they promote aggressive behavior in players.
The United States has had its share of speculation as well. In June, the United States Supreme Court rejected a proposal to ban the sale and rental of violent video games to underage children in California.
This hasn’t stopped violent video game production. Every year, the best-selling video games in the United States are also some of the most violent. This year the nation’s best-selling games included the war-based Call of Duty: Black Ops and the more traditional fighter-game Mortal Kombat 2011.
October has brought us slick ambushes in Batman: Arkham City, and November promises first- and third-person shooters in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Uncharted 3.
With all these violent video games and no solid link to an increase in violent behavior — those that support the link have little convincing evidence — you’d think people would learn to stop stereotyping these games as so-called bad influences.
But parents can’t stop worrying about their children. Though it’s possible young players would be more prone to imitative violence, it’s important to remember the most violent games are rated mature for a reason. Most adults aren’t going to start running around shooting people and stealing cars after a session of Grand Theft Auto. Violence is just a single part of video games’ overall entertainment value.
What regulators fail to recognize is how violent video games can actually benefit adult gamers.
For one, violent video games allow a player to enter and control a fantasy world to act out scenarios he or she otherwise wouldn’t.
“[A] teen can try out different identities — how it feels to be a hero, a trickster, a feared or scorned killer or someone of a different age or sex — in the safe fantasy world of a video game,” said Cheryl K. Olson in a New York Times article.
For older teenagers and adults, violent video games offer first-hand, mature-oriented adventures that fit their age better than those offered by non-violent children’s games. Violent video games allow for more direct interaction and control in environments significantly less structured than those found in movies, television shows and books.
Through the use of violence, video games can reduce stress by distracting adult gamers from the pressures of everyday life. College students attempting to juggle school, part-time work, finances and household chores, for example, might find button-mashing violence to be a safe and enjoyable way to release pent-up frustrations. According to a 2010 study conducted by Texas A&M associate professor Christopher Ferguson, violent video games can be used as therapeutic outlets for combat depression and anger.
With the popularity of violent video games, they have also become some of the best socialization tools. Many violent video games are successful because they share an emphasis on multiplayer features. The best-selling Call of Duty franchise, for example, uses online combat in a familiar war-scenario to foster competitive, fun environments.
According to a study published in Psychology of Violence’s August issue, the degree of competitiveness in video games is more likely than the amount of violence to cause aggression in gamers. But how do we even measure competitiveness? How do we distinguish “safe” competitive environments from “unsafe” ones? If competitiveness can cause aggressive behavior, should people stop playing sports? Or board games?
A little competition isn’t necessarily an instigator for aggressive behavior. In fact, it can be one of the safest and healthiest ways for people to learn to channel their energies and cooperate with others in a rule-based environment.
Though the violence in Black Ops is grittily realistic and might cause an outburst or two, players must use their competitive mindsets to work together to win. This ultimately establishes a team atmosphere in which people can communicate openly and form or disband parties as they please. These features dilute the violence factor and make the game more about strategy and camaraderie than about brute killing.
Violent video games might have a bad reputation, but this isn’t a good reason to deny the possible benefits reaped from playing them. After all, violence is everywhere these days — in movies, the news and on television — so why would video games targeted at having fun and relieving stress be the only form of entertainment stigmatized?
 
 Hannah Muniz is a junior majoring in East Asian languages and cultures and creative writing. Her column “Game Over” runs Wednesdays.
That’s where you’re wrong Nate.  Some games do cause violence or killing based on desensitization of zombified gameplay.  I’m all for the freedom of games, but it has to be taken with  grain of salt.  You don’t have to play 24/7, read a book sometime, you’ll find stories can take you to another world as well.
The sad thing is, that anyone that has ever played ANY game understands this, but the “experts” don’t know crap about anything and want to blame games on child hood misbehavior or violence, instead of the parents or other factors like friends and relatives.
Focus on the real problem “experts” and stop trying to push it on a scapegoat.

Though Los Angeles’ art history is rich, the focus given to West Coast art (compared to that given to New York artists) has been, in the past, somewhat flimsy. But “Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980,” the largest arts project to have ever taken place in the L.A. area, intends to fix this misconception by illuminating L.A. artists from the mid-20th century who shaped the landscape of modern art. Running from October through April 2012, the initiative plans to bring shows to more than 60 museums and educational institutions that will focus on the history of art in Los Angeles.
Social critique · Pieces like David Hammons’ “America the Beautiful” serve as symbols and intriguing, artistic innovations. - Photo courtesy of Hammer Museum
As part of the initiative, “Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles 1960-1980,” a show that focuses on the legacy of Los Angeles’ African-American artists and their impact on the L.A. art scene, is running at the Hammer Museum through Jan. 8.
“Now Dig This!” features the works of prominent artists like Betye Saar, David Hammons and Fred Eversley, and these varying and diverse artists are paralleled by the 140 works that feature everything from the seminal to the avant-garde.
These works serve as an investigation of different time periods and artistic styles, while the relationship between African-American artists and the city of Los Angeles is examined closely through sculpture, painting and interview footage.
The show opens with a series of socially conscious works infused with American history. From Charles White’s painting “Harriet” (1972) to Melvin Edwards’ metal piece “Cotton Hangup” (1966), a variety of historical landmarks are expressed, ranging from the struggles of slavery to the civil rights movement.
The exhibit continues with a focus on “assemblage,” a collage-like artistic movement that appeared predominantly in the West Coast in the early 1960s. The exhibit emphasizes the effect that the 1965 Watts Rebellion had on the assemblage movement, as artists began to use artifacts from the riots in their multimedia pieces. Noah Purifoy’s “Watts Uprising Remains” (1966), for example, is featured alongside many other pieces that gleaned charred items from the debris of the riots.
Various assemblage pieces of Betye Saar are featured, as well as anecdotes about her prominent roles as a feminist and social activist in the 1960s. Many of her works use family items and tokens to express a sense of self, while others such as “To Catch a Unicorn” (1960) are more reflective of her thoughts on racism and sexism in America.
Assemblage takes on a relationship with Los Angeles in Dale Brockman Davis’ “Home is Where You Make It” (1970s); the piece’s bleakness comments on the promise Los Angeles held — and broke — for many African-Americans when they were greeted with racially restrictive housing covenants upon moving to California.
The exhibition also focuses on the landmarks — both literal and figurative — that influenced the L.A. art scene in the 1960s.
The birth of Gallery 32, a space that featured works by Betye Saar, Emory Douglas and David Hammons, while ultimately helping to foster the African-American artistic community in Los Angeles, is repeatedly mentioned in the exhibit. The 1966 show “66 Signs of Neon” is brought up throughout the exhibit as well, as many of the relics from the Watts riots displayed at the Hammer Museum were originally featured at the 1966 exhibit.
The cross-section of medias and styles examines the change and growth of what happened in the West Coast art world from the ’60s to the ’70s. David Hammons’s “America the Beautiful” (1968) is one of the most memorable pieces as far as construction. His “body prints” consist of the artist dousing himself in margarine, placing his body on a sheet of paper and sprinkling pigment on the surface.
On the more conventional side is Joe Overstreet’s painting “The New Aunt Jemima, 1964” (1970), which despite its commonplace medium shows a new side of an old story by empowering Aunt Jemima with a pancake-shooting machine gun.
Though “Now Dig This!” covers a broad spectrum of work by African-American artists, it focuses on a distinctive period of time that saw visual artists and activists come together to form a movement of people who wanted to question art, society and their city of Los Angeles.
Sounds like a great exhibit.. Very well written review..Can’t wait to see it!

Texas Killing Fields has all the potential to be a great film. With a star-studded cast, a unique setting rich with character and a storyline that, when verbalized, is enough to send chills down your spine, the film has all the makings of a truly suspenseful edge-of-your-seat thriller. The lack of character and story development and the disappointing climax, however, make the movie forgettable and unsatisfying.

Directed by Ami Canaan Mann, Texas Killing Fields follows two headstrong, clashing detectives, Mike (Sam Worthington) and Brian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), through a small town in South Texas as they track a sadistic serial killer who dumps the bodies of his female sexual assault murder victims in a wide stretch of barren wasteland — the “killing fields.”
The film opens with the death of a young prostitute and the disappearance of another young woman, igniting a cat-and-mouse chase in which the killer predictably catches on and starts playing games with the detectives using hints and mind games.
When the killer kidnaps Little Anne, a young, bright girl living in sordid conditions — a girl Mike and Brian have taken a liking to — the plot minimally thickens as the stakes are raised for the two detectives.
The young girl’s fate was blaringly obvious from the beginning as she was repeatedly placed in ominous situations, lending the viewers to predict she was the killer’s next victim from the start.
The film has a strong premise, but it suffers from constantly straying off-point and introducing a surfeit of characters who, though interesting, have little to contribute to the plot and whose fates were left unresolved at the film’s conclusion.
Though Worthington and Morgan give convincing and powerful performances, their characters are underdeveloped in the script and their personalities are at times annoyingly indistinguishable.
Jessica Chastain (Tree of Life, The Help) stars as Pam, a detective who also happens to be Mike’s ex-wife. Though Chastain’s talent as an actress is undeniable both by her onscreen performances and her impressive credentials, her character in this film is frustratingly nondescript.
Furthermore, the failed marriage between her and Mike is alluded to only a few times, leaving the audience craving a bit of personal background and history to the potentially interesting couple. The young Chloë Grace Moretz shines as Anne, giving arguably the best performance of the lot; however, her character also suffers from an underdeveloped script.
Though based on a haunting true story undeniably worthy of a big-screen portrayal, Mann’s film fails to encompass the enormity of the real-life tale because of a too-narrow plotline; in the actual killing fields just outside Texas City, more than 50 corpses of young female victims of a serial killer have been discovered since 1969 — and the case was never solved.
Though the film alludes to the scale and atrocity of deaths, it focuses too narrowly on two individual cases: the disappearance of the young woman early in the film and the disappearance of Anne. The film would have benefited from further context development regarding these horrendous killing fields to increase the stakes for the two young women and for the two detectives assigned to the case.
That’s not to say the film doesn’t have its moments. Within the first 20 minutes, Texas Killing Fields is sure to leave the audience literally screaming, in response to a masterfully portrayed suspense scene that establishes the killer from the get-go as a ruthless, merciless monster.
Furthermore, the cinematography — particularly in those first 20 minutes — is poignant, yet chilling, featuring haunting shots of the decrepit town and barren fields set to eerie yet beautiful music.
The bar is set high, but the rest of the movie fails to grip or compel as hoped. Even the climax, which solves the underlying mystery of the entire film, is not-so-subtly hinted from the beginning and fails to astonish as originally anticipated.
Though it masquerades as a fast-paced thriller with high stakes and abundant surprises along the way, the film suffers from underdevelopment and insignificant twists, ultimately rendering it unsuccessful in achieving the grandeur it promises.

After a recent recruiting session with General Mills, I felt accomplished looking at the number of business cards I had collected this season. As I basked in my accomplishments, another student tapped on my shoulder and asked me, “Hey, can I copy the information on the business cards you got tonight?”
“Go ask for your own,” I replied.
Though I felt embarrassed by what I said, I justified the words with the need to stay competitive in the current market and the cutthroat job search environment. For some, work is not only a means to sustain living, but instead consumes their lives so much they are no longer “working to live,” but “living to work.”
It’s no longer just seniors who face and compete under the immense pressure of career placement and recruitment. The stress of the job search has trickled down to juniors and underclassmen, where it’s increasingly common to see younger students stressing over internships and questioning which font style to use on a résumé.
Though it’s good to prepare for professional life after college, some of us take career preparation and jobs too seriously. With job opportunities set to rise 9.5 percent for the class of 2012, according to the U.S. News & World Report, the competition for these spots could be more intense than ever. It is necessary for students to evaluate the importance of job opportunities before they sacrifice the rest of their lives for the conventional definition of success.
Achievement, as it relates to jobs, is supposed to make people feel satisfied and accomplished, but it becomes a problem when advances on the professional front no longer bring them joy but serve as motivation to strive even harder for the next goal, feeding into the vicious cycle of workaholism.
With the increasing competitiveness of our school, evident in the yearly rise in the U.S. News & World Report rankings, it is not surprising more prestigious firms, whether in the financial or technological sector, are recruiting from USC campus. But it is not uncommon to meet cutthroat individuals at recruiting sessions who are more interested in their own career development to maximize probability of getting a job offer, as opposed to helping each other out.
After talking to some of my senior friends about their career choices, I realized a lot of students’ career decisions are based on the prestige and pay of the job. Some students believe good pay and prestige will offset the horrible 100-plus hours of long, dry work per week.
When I asked my friends at European universities whether they face as much stress in the job search, they told me people are more relaxed, they enjoy life and they do not feel as much pressure for career preparation as American colleges impose on their students.
Knowing how to balance life is the key to this problem. As cliché as the concept might sound, it is important not to dedicate life entirely to work. What activities relax you? Think about the time you spend on Facebook procrastinating that otherwise could be used for leisure activities that remind you there are other aspects to life to enjoy. By spending time on other activities, we increase work efficiency when it comes time to apply for jobs.
Not all of us will be lucky enough to find a job that aligns with our individual passions, or a job where work can intersect with life itself.

I don’t blame you, Victoria, for spurning that other student who tried to piggyback off of the contacts you made. And even when you got all those business cards/job leads, it’s not even a guarantee at that. 
My friend and I went here and graduated in ’10. We both majored in the same, finance at Marshall; and he had a higher GPA than me, did more interns, went to more interviews…and still didn’t land a job related to banking/finance, nor is he making the kind of money he’s “supposed to” at his current job.  
…It ain’t getting any easier.

Linn State Technical College, a small technical school outside of Linn, Mo., with an enrollment of only 1,200 students recently decided it was in the best interest of the school to make drug testing mandatory for enrollment, becoming the first university in the country to do so.
Hye You | Daily Trojan
Normally, the administrative decisions of Linn State Technical College are of little importance to anyone outside of the city of Linn. Though it might seem irrelevant, this policy is a direct infringement on students’ right to privacy.
Under the new rule, LSTC would require every new student to take urine tests at their own expense within the first five to 10 days of the school year, or they must withdraw from the university.
If a student tests positive, he or she is given 45 days to test cleanly to stay at the school. Afterward, the student is subject to random testing throughout the rest of the year, again at the risk of being kicked out of school.
No matter the reasons LSTC gives for testing its students, such as “preparing their students for a profitable future,” mandatory drug testing is too much of an invasion into its students’ lives to be an acceptable rule. Privacy goes out the window when school-wide testing is implemented, and any benefits gained from this testing are overly stained by the precedent it sets about the ability of schools to regulate students’ lives.
How does the university defend this paranoid solution to combat drug use? LSTC insists the consummate college is different from that of conventional universities, in that the vast majority of its programs deal with high-voltage electricity, heavy equipment or caustic chemicals.
Naturally, mixing these types of fields with drugs can lead to very dangerous situations. There is a difference, however, between banning drugs, a perfectly reasonable regulation, and implementing mandatory drug testing upon the entirety of a student body. If someone is careless enough to come to a class that deals with dangerous chemicals while under the influence of other dangerous chemicals, he or she deserves to be severely punished or expelled from the school.
The threat of expulsion certainly seems a more sane deterrent against the dangerous use of drugs while completing school coursework. The administration at LSTC, however, needs to understand the difference between these two solutions.
The American Civil Liberties Union sees the dangers to individual student rights created by this radical approach. The ACLU is suing the university over this rule, citing the obvious disregard for individual students’ right to privacy.
If the lawsuit comes out favorably, this action will hopefully cause LSTC to revert to a more practical approach against drug use by its students.
The university’s concern about the dangers an intoxicated student would pose to himself and his classmates is valid. Still the potential danger of one careless student does not justify the violation of the entire student body’s privacy by testing without any initial suspicion.
Thankfully, this kind of thinking is not ignored by groups like the ACLU, even in institutes of higher education as small as LSTC.
Violation of student rights is something that should not be tolerated in any scale; if it were allowed unchecked in somewhere small like Linn, it would run the risk of setting a precedent that would spread to more immediately relevant areas.
 
Daniel Grzywacz is a sophomore majoring in cinematic arts-critical studies. His column “Thoughts From the Quad” runs Wednesdays. 
The ACLU is protecting the right of drug users to interact with “high-voltage electricity, heavy equipment or caustic chemicals?”  This is why the ACLU is pointless.  There are plenty of governmental violations of rights that are ignored, but something stupid like this, they’re all over.
Great Article!

Monday night, The Music Box in Hollywood hosted the newly popular “The Naked and Famous,” an indie rock group from Auckland, New Zealand that gained recognition with the release of its wildly popular hit single “Young Blood.”
The show mirrored the album precisely, forming a catchy blend of upbeat, mellow and downright trippy that somehow suits both wildly energetic dance-a-maniacs and more subdued audience members. The group, comprising four males and one female lead singer, has a unique alternative ‘electro-pop’ sound reminiscent of what might happen if you combine MGMT with the XX.
The band played nearly all of the songs from its album, most of which were noticeably better live than on the record thanks to high-quality vocals, dazzling visual effects and palpable energy and passion emanating from each band member.
The performance was powerful and lively, if a bit predictable. The songs had a natural, flowing progression, and after exiting the stage for a few minutes, the members unsurprisingly returned to perform one of their more popular songs “Girl Like You” and the obvious finale “Young Blood.”
In addition to the dynamic headlining performance from TNAF, the Music Box also featured a short but undeniably impressive and memorable set from the up-and-coming indie rock band “The White Arrows.”
Featuring five young men — three of whom are related — the group has an electro-infused, pop-rock sound that was refreshingly unique and undeniably catchy, especially for a lesser-known band. The members laughed and joked along with the audience as they played their almost hypnotic tunes, mesmerizing the unsuspecting crowd by the quality of the music as well as their charm and energy. Though they played for less than an hour, they certainly left an impression on me and many of my fellow concertgoers.
All in all, the evening was a thoroughly enjoyable night of great music and great company, providing a welcome respite from the school week and exposure to promising new artists.

Israli soldier Gilad Shilat was released Tuesday after more than five years in captivity, in exchange for the freedom of more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners.
Shilat had been held by Palestinian group Hamas after being captured during a cross-border raid in 2006. The 25-year-old soldier met with Israel Prime Minister Ben Netanyahu and his family.
“Today we are all united in joy and in pain,” Netanyahu said in a speech.
By bus, 477 Palestinian prisoners crossed into Gaza where they were released. About 550 other prisoners are scheduled to be freed in the coming months.
There has been debate over whether Hamas will gain more political traction after this deal is complete, especially considering that this is the largest number of prisoners Israel has ever exchanged.
“I know that the price is very heavy for you,” Netanyahu wrote in a statement. “I understand the difficulty to countenance that the evil people who perpetrated the appalling crimes against your loved ones will not pay the full price that they deserve. During these moments I hope that you will find solace that I and the entire nation of Israel embrace you and share your pain.”
Others supporting Hamas believed the group could have bargained for a better deal.
“The initial glow has died down,” Muhannad Abdul Hamid, a Palestinian political analyst and newspaper columnist, told the Los Angeles Times. “People thought Hamas broke through all of Israel’s red lines, but now there is some disappointment.”
Some of the Palestinian prisoners released will be deported back to Israel, where they face arrest again if they are suspected of criminal activity.

She’s taken us up and down California, into outer space and to the greatest Friday night party the world has ever seen. Now, Katy Perry is at it again with her latest single, “The One That Got Away.”
The release of this song marks the sixth single from Perry’s record-breaking sophomore effort, Teenage Dream, and possibly her final shot at glory from the album.
Back in summer 2010, “California Gurls” topped the Billboard Hot 100. It was succeeded by “Teenage Dream” in the fall. The third single, “Firework,” blasted to number one in the winter and was speedily followed by the outrageous “E.T.” Having four songs top the charts, Capitol Records released “Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)” which after a heavy marketing campaign reached the pinnacle of Billboard.
That’s five chart toppers. Five songs from one album. The only other person to accomplish that feat was Michael Jackson with five of the singles from Bad. This means that Katy Perry has become only the second artist — and first female — of all time to release five number one songs from one album.
If Perry’s “The One That Got Away” rises to the top of the charts, she will have become the first person in history to have six singles from one album take the top spot on Billboard.
Can she do it?
Maybe more importantly, if she does accomplish this task, what does this say about today’s music biz?
“The One” has been available for radio airplay for a few weeks now, but has yet to create an impact. The music video was filmed on Oct. 2, but has yet to be released. Once it is, the song will indubitably see a push in sales.
But it seems that Perry is taking the entertainment road to success this time around. Saturday night marked the first media performance of “The One” on the UK’s X Factor.
Perry stripped down her candyland extravaganza, appearing on stage with only an acoustic guitar, three band members and two backup singers. The performance was vocal-oriented, which is not a new route for the attention-grabbing Perry, but is not what most people expect from the pop star.
She is set to perform the song at the American Music Awards, and will continue to play the track during her California Dream Tour which is closely nearing the end of its run. Recently, Perry infused Adele’s number one hit “Someone Like You” into the bridge of her current single while on tour overseas.
If she does break Michael Jackson’s (and her) record, will this shift the playing field in pop music? Will Perry deserve the title of Queen of Pop that has so arbitrarily been tossed around between Britney Spears, Lady Gaga and Madonna? Or will this simply cement the idea that pop music is really brainless drivel easily consumed by the masses?
Or does it say that pop music is something more?

USC’s Robotics Research Lab has begun working toward a lofty goal: to help children suffering from autism-spectrum disorders interact more easily with other people.
Its method? The RRL is using robots to simulate human actions and allow the children to get used to normal interaction with other beings.
The first incarnation of Bandit, a child-sized, cartoonish robot, was created about four years ago with the intention of acting as a human stand-in for children who are easily overwhelmed by other people.
The 2011 Bandit serves the same purpose, but now has an appealing face with movable eyebrows and mouth, as well as camera eyes that allow him to watch and record his playmates. The idea behind the robot was to create a machine that looked neither too robotic nor too human, so that autistic children would feel comfortable interacting with it.
The most advanced version of Bandit is capable of many things: it can mimic motions, lead a game of Simon Says, blow bubbles, move his eyebrows and mouth, and sense whether children are moving towards or away from him.
Maja Mataric, co-director of the RRL at USC, told the Los Angeles Times, “Robots are simpler than people. We’re trying to create something that’s endearing.”
Bandit allows children to make emotional connections with something other than an inanimate object, and serves as a stepping-stone to being comfortable with human emotions and social cues. The system runs automatically, meaning it “learns” from the actions of children and reacts appropriately.
Several small studies have looked at the effectiveness of Bandit with autism spectrum disorder patients, though Mataric laments the lack of willing children and families.
However, the studies that have been performed have left the RRL with hopeful results. Bandit encourages children to play with others, teaching important concepts like sharing and play initiation.
The future of Bandit hinges mainly on whether or not RRL can secure the resources necessary for large-scale clinical trials. Mataric hopes to someday market a home version of the robot, so families and children can interact with Bandit on their own time. However, the advancement of the studies must come first, which poses significant difficulties for the relatively small laboratory.
The robot is not without difficulties, as for some children the therapy is a hindrance more than a help. Some kids become possessive of the robot, while others are disinterested or afraid of it. Hopefully, the laboratory will raise the necessary funds and be able to market Bandit on a larger scale, to better serve autistic children across the country.

The state of Alabama recently passed a new law further restricting illegal immigration. Although the Federal court blocked parts of the immigration law, Alabama’s law is still stricter than that of any other state.
Among portions blocked by the federal court were requirements for public schools to check students’ immigration status. Provisions of the law blocking the harboring and transportation of illegal immigrants were also blocked.
But the majority of the law remains intact. A section was upheld that requires both state and local law enforcement officers to verify the immigration status of people that appear “reasonably suspicious” at traffic stops or arrests.
Alabama is home to some 130,000 undocumented immigrants. With the introduction of Alabama’s immigration law, many have fled the state  — visible in classroom absences and failures of workers to show up at a variety of businesses, including restaurants and tomato fields.
It is a felony for illegal immigrants to engage in “business transactions” within Alabama. This includes applying for driver’s or business licenses. Provisions in the new law also make contracts knowingly made with illegal immigrants invalid.
Governor Robert J. Bentley, who signed the legislation, known has HB 56, in June, said in a statement that, “if the federal government had done its job by enforcing its own immigration laws, we wouldn’t be here today.”
There have been passionate responses both in support and in opposition of the law.
Civil rights groups, including the ACLU, have been fighting the recent legislation.
Mary Bauer, legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center, calls the law a “humanitarian crisis.” Callers to this organization’s hotline report fear to drive sick relatives to doctors, bullying at schools and difficulty obtaining water from municipal water companies for those that can’t prove themselves documented.

The university jumped 18 spots this year to No. 55 on the Times Higher Education World University Rankings list.
The Times rankings, published Oct. 6., placed USC just under Boston University at No. 54 and just above King’s College London at No. 56. USC was ranked below UCLA, which came in at No. 13. California Institute of Technology, Harvard University and Stanford University took the first three spots, respectively.
In September, U.S. News & World Report ranked USC 23rd in the country above UCLA at No. 25.
The Times evaluates universities worldwide in five major categories: teaching, international outlook, industry income, research and citations. A score out of 100 is generated for each category and the scores, weighted based on their significance, are combined to determine an overall score.
USC received a score of 41 in international outlook, its lowest individual score.
Even with the overall jump, some students said they were unsure about the results of the evaluation. The low score in the international outlook category confused students, because USC holds a reputation as one of the most international schools in the United States.
“USC advertises itself as the most international school in the nation and we have a lot of study abroad,” said Julia Thomas, a junior majoring in theatre.
Thomas also expressed surprise at the university’s low teaching score, a major factor in the difference between USC and UCLA on the rankings chart.
“We have an excellent teaching staff,” Thomas said. “A lot of the people I’ve talked to have only had great things to say about their professors.”
The five categories are comprised of 13 separate performance indicators. These indicators are either statistical data, such as faculty-to-student ratio or Ph.D. degrees awarded per bachelor’s degrees, or interpretations of the results from the Academic Reputation Survey, a worldwide poll conducted by the Times and completed by 17,500 experienced university scholars. The Times said it has full confidence in its unique ranking methods.
USC earned an overall score of 64 out of 100, faring best in industry income, a measure of innovation, and in citations, a measure of the number of faculty members referenced in professional journals.
Last year’s score of 60.7 rose because the sub-scores in all five categories increased or remained the same, with a nearly 10 percent increase in citations and international outlook. USC also provided the Times with industry income data this year, which it did not previously offer, earning a score of 99.3 in the category.
Students also voiced doubts about the accuracy of the Times’ core ranking methodology — the Academic Reputation Survey.
“If you do have a ranking system, it should be based on the contributions of the students who come out of the school,” said Svadharma Keerthi, a freshman majoring in biological sciences.
Sara Burton, a sophomore majoring in music industry, said colleges appeal to students for a variety of reasons and these reasons cannot be encompassed in a college ranking.
“The whole thing is really silly, that there’s a ranking system at all,” Burton said. “Each person is going to have a different reason to go to college and the college they choose is going to be based on what they want, not on what people say is the best place to go.”

When first-year graduate student Imran Khalid arrived on campus last week, he discovered he had to wait 30 minutes to find a parking spot. The Viterbi School of Engineering’s fall career fair closed off part of Parking Structure A, which led to excessive congestion. Irritated and 20 minutes late to class, Khalid was just one of thousands of students faced with stress caused by traffic.
“The distance from my house to USC is 20 miles, and the time it takes me to get to school depends on the time I leave,” Khalid said. “At times, the traffic is so jammed on the freeway, I’ll have to exit and travel beside the freeway. Then it takes an hour and 20 minutes instead of only 25 minutes.”
Traffic is in fact one of the primary reasons Forbes ranked Los Angeles as the most stressed city in America.
Alan Hyunh, a USC alumnus and transportation expert, said the state of the economy could also increase traffic.
“Ever since the recession hit, people are looking for more work,” Hyunh said. “People are driving more in the middle of the day than when the economy was good. This is relevant more so today than in times prior because of the current economic situation that the country is in.”
Hyunh said despite the problem, there are resources available to solve the issue.
USC Transportation offers options to ease the burden of commuting to school; such as parking permits, carpooling shuttles and buses between Los Angeles Union Station and the two USC campuses.
The biggest concern for Natalie Pierson, a senior who lives on the University Park Campus but commutes to the Health Sciences Campus for classes, is planning life around the congested freeways and crowded streets.
“The most stressful thing is not knowing whether there will be traffic in the morning, and having to wake up an hour early,” Pierson said.
She said this happened during the Caregivers’ Strike last week.
“They were picketing sections of [the Health Sciences Campus] so we got an email about delay … unfortunately, I had a midterm that day, so I had to leave about 45 minutes earlier than I wanted to,” Pierson said. “You have to take into account traffic and other obstacles when you commute.”
Danielle Silva, a graduate student in architecture and a commuter student, said she spends several hours a day stuck in traffic.
“The traffic is definitely why [Los Angeles] is so stressed,” Silva said. “When you think about the fact that you only have so many hours of the day, and two of them are being spent in traffic, it’s frustrating.”
Traffic and congestion, however, are simply a part of commuting in the greater Los Angeles area and commuters must consider alternative forms of transportation.
“Greater flexibility is the best way to deal with stress because it gives you more time to take control of what you’re doing with your life,” Hyunh said.
Commuters must learn to deal with the stress of traffic in their own unique ways, according to Pierson.
“As an [occupational therapy] major, you learn the importance of your occupations and the meaning they play in your life,” Pierson said. “I found the occupations that decrease the stress in my life, and I make time for them before I drive to class. Basically, the most important thing is finding time for those things that you’re passionate about.”
I’m also a commuter student who drives about 13mi for classes at HSC.  No traffic=15 mins; rush hour=40 mins.  I avoid this by arriving on campus by 6:50am even though classes don’t start till 8.  I also plan my trip home to avoid rush hour– always plenty of studying to do until traffic subsides. The “life traffic” feature on Google Maps is very useful.

The Graduate and Professional Student Senate launched a pilot program Monday to provide discounted Metro Transit Access Pass cards to graduate students currently enrolled full time at USC.
Ticket to ride · The pilot discounted Metro pass program caused the graduate student programming fee to increase $4.50 to $35.50. - Matt Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
The program, which is three years in the making, started after GPSS discussed the difficulty students had receiving passes from Metro at a Campus Affairs committee meeting in fall 2009.
Most graduate students did not qualify for the standard student discount cards offered by Metro because it requires enrollment in a minimum of 12 units per semester. Masters students generally take nine units and Ph.D. students usually take only three or four units per semester.
Graduate students will now have access to all Metro services until Dec. 16 for $25. The regular rate is $75 for nine weeks.
Ryan Estes, president of GPSS, said students’ initial reactions have been positive and GPSS hopes to increase the number of students participating in the program.
“We’ve got 250 people enrolled in the program so far and our goal is to get about 1,500,” Estes said. “If successful, the program will be continued next year.”
The pilot program is being funded by an increase in the programming fee that every graduate student is required to pay each semester upon enrollment. The programming fee has been increased to $35.50, an increase of $4.50 from last year.
If the subsidized Metro pass program becomes permanent next year, the programming fee will permanently increase another $4.50 to $39.50 and will remain at that amount.
Megan Pennington-Boggio, a Ph.D. student in chemistry, said the program will be helpful to commuter students like her.
“I used to drive to college, which turned out to be very expensive because of the high cost of fuel and parking,” Pennington-Boggio said. “If this program had been there when I [enrolled], I would have always taken public transport.”
Graduate students can apply to the program by filling out a form on the USC Transportation website, accessible by clicking  “Grad Student Metro TAP Pass” in the Public Transit section.
“It was super easy and completely online,” Pennington-Boggio said. “I was done in like five minutes.”
Jenny Novak, former GPSS president and the program’s coordinator, said the program contributes to the university’s effort to create a more sustainable campus.
“The university board of trustees [supported] and [allowed] the increased programming fee, which made it all possible.” Novak said. “This program will encourage more students to take public transport.”
Novak said Metro’s unexpected TAP card price hike proved the biggest challenge in implementing the program.
“We had to renegotiate the whole deal, which was why the program couldn’t start at the beginning of the semester,” Novak said.
Discounted Metro cards became active Monday and can be picked up from the GPSS office at Ronald Tutor Campus Center room 224 after completing the online application and payment.
In mid-November, GPSS will meet with Metro to determine the future of the program. Estes said GPSS will work to make the reduced rates permanent for USC graduate students  if it gets a strong positive reaction from students or sees a high participation rate.
This is awesome! I live downtown and research off campus. It is perfect for all grad students, even if you live around campus or have a car. Hopefully soon we’ll have the Expo line up and running. Trips to Venice Beach or Santa Monica, anyone?
Sorry, Anon, this isn’t available for undergraduate students. But it could possibly happen in the future. Talk to your USG representatives.
Is this discounted metro pass available through some program for undergraduate commuter students?
