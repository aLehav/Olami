If you have ever studied abroad, which I did in Switzerland last semester, you know how your weekdays are filled with work and exploring local spots, while weekends are for traveling everywhere possible. There is a sense of urgency to see as much as you can, eat as much as you can and do as much as you can. Now at USC, that drive to explore remains. I’m a Pacific Northwest girl, so Los Angeles is all new to me. This column is dedicated to local adventures and places to explore in Southern California.
This week, I went to a live taping of Jimmy Kimmel Live. Anyways, I was sitting in WRIT 150 when I got an email explaining I received tickets for a taping that day. Being the responsible student I am, I skipped my afternoon class, grabbed a friend and headed into Hollywood. The  Studio is situated across from Grauman’s Chinese Theatre and to my happiness, next to a Ghirardelli Soda Fountain. 
I may or may not have thoroughly enjoyed a Treasure Island Sundae while we waited in line.  Thank goodness I did — we were in that line for a hearty hour and a half. But hey, the general tickets were free and I had my sundae and my best friend. So all was well in the world. General tickets, however, don’t promise getting in like priority tickets do. And if you are walking through Hollywood around 3 p.m. on a weekday and feel prompted to test your luck — there is a queue for standby tickets.
We finally entered inside the studio and promptly pushed through security. Phones had to be turned off while inside (and they do check). Unfortunately, no snaps of Jimmy. My water bottle was also confiscated to be picked up later. So yeah, apparently don’t bring a water bottle.
Security was followed by yet another line into the studio to be seated. Once seated, we got a run through of the rules by a guy in a beanie and tight shirt. Basically, we were asked to not cause a scene by interrupting the show unless we want to be jailed and to fake enthusiasm to the extreme. Next up was a comedian sent to warm up the crowd. While his jokes were decent, all he really had to do was pull out the promo prizes and the audience went wild. I did not get a shirt. It’s tragic. Again, we were reminded to clap and make noise when the green sign lit up and stop when the red did, a process made simple enough that even a UCLA student would know what to do.   
At last, Jimmy Kimmel came out, and yes he is even cuter in person. Between takes of interviewing actor Dennis Quaid (my childhood crush thanks to The Parent Trap) and comedian Bill Burr, he engaged with the crowd, conversing with the front row about their vacations in Los Angeles. 
The whole crew was kind, entertaining the crowd as they went about their job. I do have to mention that out of the 40 crew members that I saw, only one was a woman. Just going to put that out there. Anyways, the taping ended with a performance by Andrew McMahon in the Wilderness. I had never heard of him before, but ended up with some new music to add to my playlist.
All in all, going to a live taping was a pleasant and interesting adventure. I personally enjoyed seeing the behind the scenes of what it takes to produce a late-night talk show. Overall, it was a four-hour experience, including the time waiting in line. You can visit 1iota.com for tickets to this show and to other tapings in the area. Say hi to Jimmy for me.

Picking a major is such a daunting decision that college students often wait until the last minute (as we tend to do with everything) to put our foot down and commit to one. Unfortunately, even then we often only take two factors seriously — money and job prospects. While these two attributes are undoubtedly important, eventually the superficiality of both will catch up to a person. No matter how much you like doing something or how much money you make every day, eventually you’ll get tired of what you’re doing.
 It’s unrealistic to assume that we’ll find one major in our undergraduate career that will emotionally satisfy us forever. Picking up hobbies along the way may sound like a viable solution, but let’s face it — most hobbies worth attaining like learning a similar language or working out actually takes some considerable effort. And if we’re not forced or obligated to do it for any other reason than to make ourselves happier, then we’ll probably end up abandoning the thought of even trying. Then we’ll go waste time by binge watching Netflix or binge drinking to tuck away in the back of our minds the daily realization there’s no motivation in life to improve ourselves. 
Have you ever noticed that at award ceremonies or any other instance where somebody is accepting recognition for a difficult feat, the majority of the time they say they didn’t do it for themselves? This mindset of working for others is the key to achieving a difficult feat because only by caring about something or somebody else more than yourself. You overcome extreme, otherwise impossible hardships. Steve Jobs, Muhammad Ali and the other people that made or currently make up the 1 percent of the population reached their level because they cared about whatever they were doing so much they were willing to embrace the hardships that accompanied them all the way to the top. Their vision superseded focusing only on making money and enjoyment at times to attain an endless array of other useful skills and habits. That’s why people who change the world aren’t one-dimensional and see every day as an opportunity to improve themselves by learning, which in turn can go towards whatever cause they’re passionate about.
 So to wrap it up, don’t neglect how much money or how much fun you’ll be having because those are both extremely important things to consider when choosing a major. But also don’t overthink them because eventually we’ll all get bored with what we’re doing, just some sooner than others. Begin to think about what you can do with the skills you’ll be learning in your major to contribute to a meaningful cause, and then expand on other skills along the way. Otherwise, you’ll end up having a midlife crisis, and wake up one day realizing that if you died today, nothing would change.

After a tough stretch of seven consecutive losses, the women’s basketball team may be turning its season around with back-to-back victories against Arizona and Arizona State over the weekend. While the Trojans struggled to find a rhythm on Friday night against Arizona, they fought throughout the game, ultimately earning USC its first wins since 2016.
“You know what, we won,” head coach Cynthia Cooper-Dyke said after her team’s first game against Arizona. “I didn’t think we played a great game. One of the things we talked about in pregame was grinding. We needed to grind out a win — do whatever it took to come away with a victory — and I thought we did that.”
With the career-high performances from freshman forward Ja’Tavia Tapley and senior center Ivana Jakubcova, the team was able to clinch the much-needed victory over the Wildcats. Standing at
6-foot-3 and 6-foot-6 respectively, the two were able to use their length and solid form under the basket to combine for 26 points and 18 rebounds.
“It was very important,” Tapley said. “With boxing out and the height advantage, we just put two and two together and just made it happen on the boards.”
Having players like Tapley and Jakubcova come through for the Trojans was even more important given the loss of yet another player due to injury this season. Sophomore guard Aliyah Mazyck had previously missed five games with a stress fracture in her foot but was able to come back for both games against UCLA last week. Those games exacerbated her injury, and there is now no timetable for her return to the court.
“We were trying to work through it,” Cooper-Dyke said. “But it was clear after the UCLA game that she couldn’t play anymore. Not only did she reaggravate it, but it is also more swollen, more painful. So we had to almost restart her rehab.”
The Trojans did not let Mazyck’s injury keep them from competing against Arizona State on Sunday. USC and ASU had the number one and two 3-point range defenses in the conference respectively going into the afternoon, meaning the game was played mostly from the inside. The Trojans shut the Sun Devils down from that range, holding Arizona State to 0-5 from beyond the arc in the first three quarters — much to the delight of Cooper-Dyke.
“What a great defensive game by my Women of Troy,” she said. “This team came out from the beginning and established ourselves defensively, and we did not let up off that pedal. It allowed us to get out on the fast break and get some buckets that we needed to keep our engine going.”
In the first half, neither team was able to pull ahead, and it was 26-25 at the break, with ASU barely holding on to its one-point lead. After the half, the Trojans were plagued with unforced turnovers, and the Sun Devils finally managed to surge ahead. By the end of the third quarter, however, the Trojans had come alive, igniting the fans in Galen Center with their play. A four-point play by freshman guard Minyon Moore started a USC scoring run, and ASU would never recover.
“When we turned over the ball it was demoralizing,” junior guard Sadie Edwards said, “[but] we didn’t put our heads down. Our coach called a timeout, and we said, ‘Let’s get this right, and let’s fix this.’ We did, and we made plays and played together.”
The Trojans will now look to build a winning streak as they head onto the road for the next four games. Their newfound spirit could be just what the team needs to turn its season around.

The women’s basketball team has shown flashes of brilliance this season. The Trojans looked strong when they defeated No. 25 Texas A&M on the road in November and when they dominated Colorado to open up conference play — and even last weekend, when they heartbreakingly lost to No. 13 UCLA by just four points.
However, the team has also experienced the lowest of lows, recently snapping a seven-game losing streak: a disastrous run that sent them plummeting down the Pac-12 standings. Part of their descent can be explained by the unexpected. There was senior guard Jordan Adams’ ACL tear in December, which may end her collegiate career (barring a medical redshirt). Sophomore guard Aliyah Mazyck’s foot fracture kept her out for two weeks, and the team’s leading scorer, junior forward Kristen Simon, had an unexplained three-game absence. 
But within all of the Trojans’ misfortune, there has been one pleasant surprise — the play of true freshman point guard Minyon Moore, which even she was not fully anticipating. 
“I didn’t come in here expecting to make such a big impact,” Moore said. “But as I’ve started to play and get in the groove of college basketball, I’ve started to get the confidence.” 
Averaging 10.8 points and 4.58 assists (eighth in the Pac-12), Moore is stepping up her game at a time when her team needs her the most. For her, the Trojans’ recent string of bad luck is no reason to back down or make excuses, especially considering what she had to overcome just to become a Division I basketball player. 
“I tore both my ACLs and meniscuses when I was high school,” Moore said. “Those were probably the biggest challenges that I’ve had to face. Just having back-to-back ACL injuries and surgeries and keeping my mindset correct because I had to work, work, work in order to get scholarships. That was the biggest adversity that I’ve had to face, but going through that experience has shown me that I can get through anything.” 
While Moore was scratching and clawing to receive scholarship offers after her injuries, her older sister Mariya Moore, a more heralded recruit out of high school, was already starring at Louisville. Now a junior averaging 12.8 points a game, Mariya continues to be a source of inspiration and rivalry for her younger sister. 
“Growing up we had a lot of competition,” Moore said. “Our dad would always have us go out and play one-on-one versus each other. Seeing her with all these accolades, and seeing her in college basketball and as a McDonald’s All-American has given me a goal to set for myself. It’s like she has that last name on the back of her shirt, so I need to go out and play for our last name. It’s given me something to work for.”
When asked if she strives to one day be better than her older sister, Moore responds as one might expect a younger sibling to.
“Yeah, definitely,” Moore said. “She and I joke around all the time about our teams, and if we play each other, who’s going to win. It’s always a family competition, but it’s all love.”
When watching Moore, the most striking aspect of her play in both practice and games is how she conducts herself as a floor general, despite being among the youngest players on the team. Whether she is talking on defense, making commands on offense or screaming calls from the bench, the freshman’s presence is always felt. 
“Being a freshman, I don’t really consider it as, ‘These are upperclassmen so I can’t be a leader to them,’” Moore said. “Since I’m a point guard, I have to take that leadership role, and if my team doesn’t know where to go, I have to lead them. I think that I have adopted a leadership position even though I’m a freshman.”
Despite her rapid ascent in such a short period of time, Moore knows she will need to improve parts of her game to reach the next level. 
“My shot and my left hand,” Moore said. “In the beginning of the season it was really easy for me, because I’m really right-hand dominant and teams didn’t really know about me yet, so I was able to go right every time and score really easily, but now that they’ve scouted me I need to change it up.” 
Quarterback Sam Darnold may be the most celebrated freshman at USC, but there is another newcomer on campus who is making waves. And like Darnold, she just may be the spark that turns a season around. 
“If we bring our effort and talent, we can win every game that we play from here on out,” Moore said. “I see these next upcoming games as opportunities for us to show that we’re bouncing back, and we’re coming out stronger.”

USC track and field travelled to Fayetteville, Ark. over the weekend for the Razorback Invitational. The Trojans brought a partial team to the Randal Tyson Track Center, choosing to give some of their athletes a rest, but they still placed well out of 14 programs in the overall team standings, with the women’s team finishing in second and the men in seventh.
The meet started strongly for USC on Friday, and multiple Trojans set personal best marks. Junior Deanna Hill was the highlight of the day, taking home first place in the women’s 200-meter dash with a personal best and national leading time of 22.94 seconds. Hill was the only 200-meter runner at the meet to record a time under 23 seconds, and that mark improved her second-place standing on USC’s all-time list for the indoor 200-meter. Meanwhile, junior Kendall Ellis ran a personal best 23.15 in the event, which was good for third overall and third on the all-time list.
Sophomore Margaux Jones finished third in the women’s long jump on Friday, turning in a season-best 20-9.25 (6.33 meters) mark. Freshman Courtney Corrin, who is ninth all-time in program history in the indoor long jump, improved on her record with a jump of 19-11.00 (6.07 meters), finishing seventh overall. On the men’s side, junior Randall Cunningham finished second in the high jump, with a clearance of 7-2.25 (2.19 meters).
The Trojans enjoyed another impressive series of performances on Saturday, the final day of the invitational. Redshirt sophomore Marquís Morris won the 60-meter hurdles with a personal best time of 7.73 seconds, which also tied him with senior Brendan Ames for third-best in USC history. Freshman Anna Cockrell and sophomore Jasmyne Graham then took home a 1-2 finish in the women’s 60-meter hurdles, both setting personal records of 8.15 and 8.22 seconds, respectively. Cockrell improved on her fifth-best time in program history, while Graham moved up on the list from ninth to seventh.
Senior Cameron Pettigrew finished first overall in the women’s 400-meter race, sprinting to a personal best time of 53.05 seconds. The new high mark bumped her from 10th to sixth on the Trojan indoor records list. Freshman Kyra Constantine finished just behind Pettigrew in second overall, setting her own personal best of 54.00 seconds — which was good for eighth-best all-time.
USC wrapped up the weekend with a team effort, as the Trojans set a collegiate-leading time in the women’s 4×400-meter relay. Ellis, Cockrell, Pettigrew and Hill combined to finish in 3:30.66 minutes, which won the event in style and also moved the quartet into third place in USC’s record books.
Next up, the track team prepares for a trip to Albuquerque, N.M. for the New Mexico Classic. The Trojans will compete over the weekend at the indoor meet before attending their first outdoor competition in Seattle in two weeks’ time.

On Sunday afternoon, Provost Michael Quick sent out a memorandum to all USC students and staff detailing the University’s response to President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration. 
The order denies entry into the United States to citizens of seven countries, including Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Libya, Somalia and Sudan. The memorandum reiterated USC’s status as a global university, and pledged the support of the administration and staff for international students affected by the executive order. 
Quick advised students from affected nations to postpone any and all international travel for the time being, and listed several resources such as the Office of International Services and the USC Gould School of Law’s Immigration Clinic for any student seeking more information about their specific case. Furthermore, Quick invited students with any ideas for how the University can support its students during this difficult time to email them to his office. 
The memorandum comes on the heels of an online petition asking that President C.L. Max Nikias and the USC administration condemn Trump’s executive order, on behalf of the thousands of international students that call USC home as well as millions of other international students around the country. The petition, which has been circulating on Facebook, also calls on Nikias and the USC administration to ensure that a USC education remains accessible, diverse and welcoming for all deserving students, no matter their ethnic, religious or citizenship background.
This is one of many reasons why being an international student isn’t easy, given our complex culture and language. Assimilation assistance must come from numerous sources to aid these young people embarking on life’s journey. Most struggle in their efforts and need guidance from schools’ international departments, immigration protection, host families, concerned neighbors and fellow students, and even informative books to extend a cultural helping hand so we all have a win-win situation.
   One such new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help anyone coming to the US is “What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.” It is used in foreign Fulbright student programs and endorsed worldwide by ambassadors, educators, and editors. It also identifies “foreigners” who became successful in the US and how they’ve contributed to our society, including students.  
   A chapter on education explains how to be accepted to an American university and cope with a confusing new culture, friendship process and daunting classroom differences. Some stay after graduation. It has chapters that explain how US businesses operate and how to get a job (which differs from most countries), a must for those who want to work with/for an American firm here or overseas. 
   It also has chapters that identify the most common English grammar and speech problems foreigners have and tips for easily overcoming them, the number one stumbling block they say they have to succeeding here. 
   Good luck to all at USC or wherever you study!

On Saturday, USC students joined thousands of volunteers for the annual Carnival of Love on Skid Row, an event that aims to provide services for homeless Los Angeles residents. 
Langa Tran, a sophomore majoring in accounting, volunteered at the event as a personal guide.
“I was assigned an individual and walked him through the various stations,” Tran said. “He didn’t want any clothes so we skipped that area and went straight to food where I sat with him while he ate. Then we went to get him some body soap and popcorn and pizza.”
Tran said that homelessness has always been an issue that resonated with her.
Skid Row is an area in downtown Los Angeles known for its high concentration of homeless people. Between 8,000 and 11,000 people live at Skid Row, according to the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce.
”There are so many control factors that can lead to homelessness,” Tran said. “It makes me extremely sad to think that these people have no one they can turn to for a home, so when I found out about this opportunity I knew I had to volunteer.” 
The Wayfarer Foundation has hosted the event for three years in a row and stated that last year over 1,500 homeless individuals came to the event. The foundation said that the goal is to “[transform] one of the worst places in America for four hours into a colorless, classless, beacon of light,” according to the event’s website.
“I spent three hours talking to a 57-year-old man about his family where almost every single individual was on drugs and died either by a stabbing, car accident or overdose,” Tran said. “It made me realize how easy it is for me to look at and make judgements on people based on their appearance.”
The residents of Skid Row filed in to get medical attention, mental health services, a dental checkups, foot washes, haircuts and massages. There were also multiple tents where homeless individuals could sort through large piles of donated clothing. 
Susana Montoya, a resident of the Skid Row area for the past two and a half years, said that the Skid Row Carnival of Love, and the clothing donations specifically, are helping her take that next step in her life and get her where she wants to be.
“Once you reach this point on Skid Row, you just want to be wanted and accepted the way you are, mistakes or not,” Montoya said. “Getting gifts to look good and looking at ourselves in the mirror and saying ‘I’m ready,’ it’s really a blessing. I really appreciate these clothes, no one knows where they’re from, so when I look to get out of Skid Row, this carnival and clothing make me feel like I fit in.”
Benjamin Franklin Chambers said he lived on Skid Row for three and a half months with his wife and daughter, but that they are now on their way out since they have been approved for housing. Chambers related how much he enjoys the Carnival of Love and how this event along with others really helps those of Skid Row get back on their feet again. 
“At first Skid Row is really really disturbing, but after a while, you see the better things of it,” Chambers said. “Even though the bad is everywhere you go, you have to overlook the bad things and focus on fighting to get out. I am so grateful and so blessed, and I am just happy to be here.” 
There were also various sources of entertainment such as a live performance by Andy Grammer of “Keep Your Head Up” and a DJ, along with food, an ice cream truck, face painters and multiple carnival games. 
Tran explained how the experience humbled her and opened her eyes to a world outside of USC. 
“I had this interaction with a 59-year-old lady, who goes by ‘Chunkeems,’” Tran said. “She told me about how my face looked like a pie and how looking at me made her hungry. I just thought about how despite her mismatched socks and disheveled attire, we were all born the same.”
Kids ran around with their painted faces and smiles, enjoying the chance to get to just play and goof around in a safe environment. 
Resident China Polite expressed the powerful impact of the carnival and how special it was that so many people were able to come together.
“This event means going global and surfacing a land that nobody sees, a land of love,” Polite said. “It’s a carnival, yes, but the event is also based upon love and giving. Everyone here is able to accept others and powerful enough to act in the name of love.”
Justin Baldoni, an event coordinator and actor in the television show “Jane the Virgin,” spoke to people, shook people’s hands and told them not to give up.
“Everything in our lives is trying to tell us that we’re broken, but we’re not. We’re not,” Baldoni said. “No matter what love always wins.”

The Asian Pacific Islander Caucus hosted Assemblymember Cristina Garcia, State Senator Holly Mitchell and Mayor Pro Tempore of Sierra Madre Rachelle Arizmendi, who discussed their experiences as women in politics Friday at Ronald Tutor Campus Center. 
As women of color, each of the panelists had to overcome the perceptions of their peers to not only get elected, but also to make a difference.
“When I first ran, I was told I wasn’t qualified because I didn’t have enough life experience, and I didn’t have a husband,” Garcia said. “I think we have multiple cards of our identity. I’ve been hustling because I’m a woman, because I am brown, because my parents are immigrants.”
Ultimately, the most important part of that skillset is self-confidence. Mitchell, a state senator, said that she identifies as a “grown-ass woman” who is capable of taking charge of her life and exerting control in a male-dominated world.
“I’m teaching a seminar at Mount St. Mary’s, and I am struck by number of times I am asked the question ‘How do you manage in a male-dominated arena?’” Mitchell said. “Frankly, my initial response is ‘How does a man manage in my world? He must have a hard time.’” 
Confidence and self-knowledge helped each of the women to feel like they belong in the world they chose to work in, even when they don’t have all the answers.
“As long as you know why you’re running, who you are, what you value and what your principles are and you’re abiding by those, you should never feel like an imposter,” Arizmendi said. 
In the midst of establishing themselves in the political sphere, Mitchell said it was difficult to maintain their own lives, especially as a mother.
“There is no such thing as balance,” Mitchell said. “I think juggle is a more accurate term, and your goal is to never let a ball come crashing down. You never have it all completely together or perfect even.”
Part of the “image of flux” has to include a place for taking care of yourself, Garcia said.
“When I first got into office, I was actually the worst example of remembering myself,” Garcia said. “I had to figure out weaknesses and have someone who would supplement them boss me around. I’ve become a much better legislator as a result.”
The panel also discussed the difficulties in raising funds for campaigns, each noting that it’s easier in many ways for a man to do so than a female candidate.
“People will give more to men then they give to women, and they don’t even know why. Institutionally, there’s some bias,” Mitchell said. “We have to figure it out.” 
The state senator also put out a call to action for women to become more active in giving financial support to female candidates.
“Women have to learn to write checks and give,” Mitchell said. “That’s not something we’ve done across the board in terms of political donations.“Women have to break through that glass ceiling of writing checks of significance to your candidates of choice.”
The panelists were also asked about their thoughts on the Women’s March that occurred last weekend. Though each of them believed the march was beneficial, they wanted to see it as a beginning to something larger.
“Hopefully that’s just a start, a spark for people to really get to the next step because really it was an amazing day, great pictures, great energy and just the passion that people had,” Arizmendi said. “That passion and energy needs to carry over and result in some kind of action because that in itself will not change what everyone is so angry about.”

President Donald Trump’s secretary of education pick Betsy DeVos has never taken out a student loan. 
Her four children have also never taken out student loans. She has no personal experience with the Pell Grant. This brings DeVos to a total of zero experience navigating federal financial aid, leaving her ill-equipped to lead the department which oversees it. 
DeVos admitted that her family was “fortunate” to have this experience, but this is a fortune unfathomable to the two-thirds of the nation’s students who rely on some form of financial aid to get through college. Approximately 34 percent of students utilize federal loan programs, and in the 2015-16 school year, 7.6 million students received the federal Pell Grant. 
The rising cost of college (and corresponding rising levels of student loan debt) is one of the most pressing issues facing college campuses today. Appointing an Education Secretary who doesn’t understand this issue, has no experience dealing with it, and has no history of addressing it is problematic. The fact that DeVos did not even acknowledge or hint at understanding how difficult it is to afford college tuition suggests that she would not be the most enthusiastic supporter of financial aid once in office. 
Of course, just because DeVos doesn’t have personal experience with financial aid and comes from a wealthy family does not mean that she automatically does not care about the issues facing lower- and middle-class families in affording college education. However, her response to Senator Bernie Sanders’ questioning during her Senate hearing did not provide much hope. 
Sanders asked DeVos whether she’d be willing to work on tuition-free college education, a central component of Sanders’ own presidential campaign. She responded, “I think that’s a really interesting idea, and it’s really great to consider and think about, but we also need to consider the fact that there’s nothing in life that’s truly free. Somebody’s going to pay for it.”
DeVos not only has no personal experience with college financial aid, but she also has no relevant experience in managing programs similar to the Pell Grant and federal student loans. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s questioning of DeVos made this abundantly clear — DeVos admitted that she had no experience managing a bank or similar program to the massive amount of funding for higher education handled by the Department of Education.
Warren stressed the importance of DeVos fully understanding financial aid, stating, “The Secretary of Education is essentially responsible for managing a $1 trillion student loan bank and distributing $30 billion in Pell Grants to students each year. The financial futures of an entire generation of young people depend on your department getting that right.”
With a secretary of education who does not seem to recognize the challenge of paying for college and has zero experience managing funding for higher education, the onus may be on institutions themselves to increase their support for low- and middle-income students.
Almost a quarter of USC’s undergraduates are Pell Grant eligible, demonstrating that USC has an inherently vested interest in who becomes the Secretary of Education, and what they do about the Pell Grant program. The Pell Grant has faced decreasing funding in the past, leading some of USC’s top administrators to visit Washington, D.C. to discuss this issue.
After receiving an ethics review, DeVos’ Senate vote was rescheduled for Jan. 31. If she is confirmed, USC will need to continue with its current student advocacy efforts at the federal level, while also furthering its commitments internally to student aid. 
This means listening and responding to student concerns, fighting for federal aid and reevaluating current aid programs to ensure more people have the opportunity to go to college. Ultimately, USC must ensure distribution of funding to the students who need it most, and especially those who would be impacted by a decrease in Pell Grant funding. These actions would help guarantee that none of USC’s current or future students will need to worry about Betsy DeVos as secretary of education impacting their education.

As minimum wage debates rage around the country, policymakers continue to argue about whether raising the minimum wage is an economic benefit. But what is often overlooked is the potential for a higher minimum wage to improve public health, especially for young people. 
For one, raising the minimum wage improves the sexual health of young women. According to research conducted by the University of Illinois between 2003 and 2014, there appears to be a solid correlation between an increase in the minimum wage and a reduction in adolescent birth rates. For every dollar that the minimum wage is raised, the rate of babies being born to mothers between the ages of 16 and 19 is reduced by about 2 percent, or roughly 5,000 babies, per year. 
Raising the minimum wage also has other positive health effects related to the birth of children, including healthier body mass index rates, reduced risk of child mistreatment and lower premature mortality rates in children. This connection has led the Los Angeles Times to quip that raising the minimum wage is a form of “birth control” for young women.
 In order to create a meaningful benefit to public health, raising the minimum wage must go hand-in-hand with support for public institutions that minimum wage workers rely on. On Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to block federal funds from being allocated to “organizations which promote abortion around the world,” which means organizations offering educational material on family planning services and sexual health to women around the world. 
While legislation that concerns domestic funding for Planned Parenthood has yet to pass, this executive action shows that Trump means to obstruct women’s access to resources for family planning. In this situation, a higher minimum wage alone could not protect women’s ability to access critical health care.
 Making reproductive health care less accessible has serious, documentable and widespread repercussions. People who do not have regular access to affordable reproductive care suffer higher rates of STIs. 
States defunding public reproductive health care clinics also contribute to higher rates of unplanned pregnancies. On top of the personal consequences of going through a pregnancy and raising a child without being emotionally or financially prepared, high rates of unplanned pregnancies cost taxpayers extraordinary sums of money in Medicare.
 Movements to defund public reproductive health care clinics such as Planned Parenthood usually are motivated by a desire to make abortions less accessible. While this is a problem, the services provided by these clinics are much broader in scope. Through organizations such as Planned Parenthood, women gain access to vital reproductive health procedures such as pap smears, medication for treatment of STIs, breast and cervical cancer screenings, affordable IUDs and daily contraceptive pills. Communities also gain greater access to education through which they can learn how to better take care of themselves and prevent STIs and unexpected pregnancies from occurring in the first place. These resources are the bulwark of ensuring positive reproductive health care — they are essential and cannot be replaced.
 There are many proven benefits to raising the minimum wage, from an overall higher standard of living, to moving hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, to a more stimulated economy. 
Ultimately, the most telling benefit is the reduction of the rate of adolescent births. Still, it is of vital importance that we protect public institutions that assist low-wage workers and provide solutions and access to critical resources that raising the minimum wage alone cannot guarantee.

“The pink sky, the blue of the night, and blackberry becomes the rain / Sweet mami wata whispers songs of the good life” is just one example of the vivid imagery in Gabriel Garzón-Montano’s “Cantiga.”
His Colombian and French heritage and upbringing in Brooklyn, New York cultivated an intricate and diverse appreciation for music evident on the singer and producer’s new album, Jardín. The album’s title, a reference to the two languages from his background, is fitting as Garzón-Montano shows a variety of genres and influences in his work, notably the soul of D’Angelo or Sly and the Family Stone, the hip-hop rhythms and beats of J Dilla and the funk groove and budding vocal charisma reminiscent of Prince.
These elements bloom on tracks like “Sour Mango,” in which an arpeggiated melody with piano layers fizzles under a head nodding rhythm, building up to an entrancing hook. Like many of the tracks on his album, “Sour Mango” combines many creative traits seldom brought together. Garzón-Montano’s talent is the silver lining here — he is the producer, arranger, composer and performer on all tracks and performs all the instruments on nearly all the songs.
His musical knowledge — ideological and technical, vocal and instrumental, street and classical — is an understated characteristic that makes the result something to marvel. Garzón-Montano brings funk and unique rhythms into “The Game,” a song with profound lyrics. Jokers in a marketplace / punish virtues and forgive mistakes / command yourself or obey / damaged goods around the way”  stimulates the senses with an allegory and metaphors.
The album may have hints of social or political commentary, but the artist still finds a groove and a conscious, healing message in his tune. “Crawl,” a clear hit on Jardín, showcases all of Garzón-Montano’s best traits in an ode to his lover that was the second promotional video in anticipation of the album.
The video, directed by Santiago Carrasquilla, takes a simple set that is brought to life by the singer’s dance and accompaniment of geometric animations, which are a feature of his concert visuals.
Both in the video and the song, Garzón-Montano does a little with a lot: The beat and vocals align and flow naturally, and that same easy energy beams throughout his video. Viewers or listeners would be hard-pressed to catch onto his effortless wavelength.
“Bombo Fabrika” pitches in cumbia influences on a trip through vivid imagery, and sprinkles of melodic bass and strings complement Garzón-Montano’s poetry. “I glow for you / I’m in the silo / oh my god brought the upon these bones / we gets up like trampolines / bombo fabrika on a roll” intersect verse and chorus that highlight his album.
 As a track that ventures to a more creative risk, it vividly displays his range as a creative intellect and performer, and rather than featuring more of the same in the second half of the album, he features fresh, ripe take on his best attributes.
“My Balloon” will raise listeners’ heads and make spirits soar. Cinematic in its musical design, the song has a true one word to an arching chorus illustrating a love that didn’t work out. In a disappointed but motivational vibe, Garzón-Montano sings how “I’ll get back on my balloon / And meet my baby on the moon / Hanging flowers in her room / And dancing just to keep my cool, keep my cool.” On every sonic aspect, the song is outstanding and further attests to Garzón-Montano’s musical authenticity. He recorded on two-inch tape, which preserves an organic and tactile audible quality often lost by other recording methods.
“My Balloon” resonates so well musically and  lyrically by showcasing elements that make it discernibly repeatable to fans. Garzón-Montano’s given and earned talents are fingerprinted throughout this project, with a passion that is infectious.
There is a distinctive sound he has built, and the album is bound to succeed with a true-to-self authenticity that doesn’t grow overnight — a truly stunning project. 
Gabriel Garzón-Montano has grown his sound with great arrangement and detail, putting Jardín in full bloom by showing his green thumb for more great music.

Allen Pham
For the first 19 years of my life, I lived under the impression that in order to be recognized as an equal to other men, I had to fit the mold. It was the small details — the words I said, the way I behaved and the things I did — that made me self-conscious of my own identity.
 Even during my childhood, I knew I wasn’t like other boys. I preferred Easy-Bake ovens over Hot Wheels, jump rope over handball and musicals over video games. In elementary school, it became difficult to assert myself in the group of boys I thought were “cool,” and I hated knowing that I couldn’t fit in with the group no matter how hard I tried.
 During the first week of middle school, a new friend introduced me to one of her friends from elementary school — and he became my “best friend.” It was a friendship that made one of the biggest differences in my life. We didn’t play basketball or Runescape. Instead, we raved over pop music together and got matching Lady Gaga wristbands from Hot Topic. That boy, my first male companion, became more than just a friend. And because of him, I discovered my sexuality.
 I hated being bisexual for most of my teenage years, but I couldn’t find interest in the typical things that other guys did or talked about. I didn’t care about League of Legends; I had no knowledge about the NBA. But why did I keep trying to act like I did? I wasn’t honest enough to admit that I could never be the person I was forcing myself to be. So I attempted different things to prove to the world and myself how “masculine” I could be.
 My first year of high school was miserable. I tried playing sports as a way of validating myself as a masculine guy who engaged in physical activities. I even dated a girl I wasn’t interested in to to use her as an escape for all the self-denial I dealt with. Things changed eventually.
 I became more open about expressing my sexuality with my close friends. I found a great group of male friends who I could confide in, who didn’t care if I was gay or straight or bi, and who I could talk to about our common interests. I could be me, and I liked it. But I continued to carry my misconception of masculinity into college.
 Like any other freshman who arrived at USC, I was desperate for a new beginning. Though I told other people I wasn’t interested in joining greek life, I was. Being heteronormative sounded like a great idea when it came to meeting new people.
 In some serendipitous way, this past year in college changed my life and, in turn, my perception of the idea of masculinity. When I finally came out to my fraternity brothers about my sexual orientation and my current relationship, I was petrified of the judgment I’d face. Would they chastise me? Would they isolate me from our group?
 Surprisingly, it was different. For the first time in college, a group celebrated my differences. They supported me. They made me feel safe to be myself. They accepted me. And because of that, I was finally able to accept myself.
 I like to think I’m more woke now than I was back then. Since coming to USC, I’ve become more educated about important issues, and I’ve learned more about myself than I ever did in the past 20 years of my life. A lot of different things have shaped my values, my perspective and my outlook — but I can’t pinpoint all the experiences and memories that ultimately made me the person I am today.
 It could be the 2016 election and the feminist movement that pushed me to be more outspoken. Or it could be the conversations I had and the friendships I made that allowed me to be more open and accepting of people different from me. Whatever it is, I’m happy with the results, and I’m glad finally feel like a man — just not in the way I thought I’d see it.
 To me, the idea of masculinity is much more nuanced than how I viewed it a year ago. When a friend asked me what I thought it meant to be a man last semester, my views began to change radically. In retrospect, I hurt a lot of people, including myself, in my attempt to meet my own, unrealistic expectations of being masculine.
 Three fundamental traits of masculinity are courage, independence and assertiveness. To be a man in the 21st century does not mean that you have to be hypersexual. It does not mean you can’t cry. And it does not mean that you have to mask your feelings or your true self. True masculinity embraces these three traits in all different, encompassing ways.
 To every guy who felt like suppressing his emotions — It’s OK to be vulnerable because that makes you human. And it makes you more masculine than ever to be confident and aware of your emotions.
 To every guy who felt afraid to come out — it’s OK to be yourself because your happiness does not stem from other people’s perception of you. You deserve to be liberated, accepted and celebrated for who you are — straight, bi, gay or trans.
 And to every guy who ever doubted his own masculinity — it’s OK to feel that way because in the end, you will learn to live by your own definition and standard. Be proud of who you are, stand up for what you believe in and don’t hide yourself in the shadows. You are masculine in your own right, in your own way. And you will be the man you want to be. I believe in you.

A young man will know he is reaching his potential as a man when he no longer gives a single thought or care about what other males think of him.
I strongly encourage ALL young men to seek this destination as SOON as you have the maturity to do so.
It is where your true freedom lies.

Singer Kehlani Parrish’s sweet voice sings the snappy line, “You think you love me now, I think you should be worried,” leaves fans with a mystifyingly new take on the R&B rising star — she is not to be messed with. “Do U Dirty” is one of many released singles from Kehlani’s 18-song tracklist — SWEETSEXYSAVAGE, which was released on Jan. 27 — and is just one snippet of the story she is telling. 
She switches up her narrative from a sweetheart with a soothing voice in “Everything is Yours,” to her seductive persona with soulful swing in “Undercover,” to a bold-voiced artist in “Personal.” The Grammy-nominated singer gets personal with her latest solo project.
As a bisexual artist, Kehlani does not feel the need to distinguish which gender she is referring to as her love interest in her lyrics. When describing the meaning behind her song “Distraction,” she said, “A lot of my songs are about women. Sometimes I don’t say ‘he’ or ‘she’ — I’m just talking. I don’t feel like I have to necessarily go over the top and make sure that I have to stuff it down people’s throats — that I like women and men.”
Kehlani’s struggles with love extend beyond a romantic level. In “Not Used To It,” she stereotypes her family life in the first verse: “Typical story of an Oakland girl / Typical story heard around the world / Mama on her way, daddy up above / After 14 I guess I’m mini tough.” 
With pain still lingering from her formative years after her dad passed away and her aunt raised her away from her drug-addicted mother, Kehlani spits out her feelings in verse about how she has a hard time opening up to a man. She longs for not only closure from her sorrow, but also for closeness with a significant other.
Kehlani’s complete exposure to her fans is best illustrated in her album artwork, showing the artist naked but with arms replete with colorful tattoos covering herself up. The Oakland native’s whispering vocals in the beginning of “Escape” hint at her previous timid nature, but it is evident Kehlani has matured musically and emotionally since her beginning days as a finalist on America’s Got Talent with her band PopLyfe.
During the band’s initial audition, judge Piers Morgan advised the then-16-year-old Kehlani, “I think you’ve got real talent, but I don’t think you need the group.” After years of co-signing with other rappers like G-Eazy and Post Malone and recently opening for Amine’s North American shows, the now-21-year-old rising star is solidifying her solo career and leaving fans screaming three words: sweet, sexy and savage.
Leaving 2016 with a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Urban Album for her mixtape You Should Be Here, Kehlani is ready to take on 2017 with her headline tour. Starting Feb. 21 in Montreal, the SweetSexySavage star, accompanied by opening acts Ella Mai, JAKHOY and Noodles, will loop through Europe before making her way back to the United States where she will conclude her tour in Los Angeles June 18 at The Novo.
