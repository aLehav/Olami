When freshman Emily Johnson first came to USC, several incidents led her to start thinking about health care access on campus. 
One of her friends struggled to stay awake with a throbbing headache after the Engemann Student Health Center denied her an appointment because of a lack of availability. Another friend, whisked away by an ambulance after experiencing chest pains because the center was closed when she required medical attention, later received a $1500 medical bill.
These experiences led Johnson to run for the USG Senate, with the hope of improving access to health resources in the upcoming school year. She and her candidate partner, sophomore Angela Chuang, have integrated several health and wellness points into their campaign platform.
“I definitely think a commonality between our biggest platform points is really how we feel like there’s a lack of resources,” Johnson said.
Student health is at the forefront of seven of the 11 USG Senate campaigns this semester, a trend that candidates say has grown from raised awareness and the desire to speak out among the student population. All three presidential tickets also list student health as one of their platform points. 
As senators, Johnson and Chuang aim to expand emergency services at Engemann, improve required safety and wellness online courses and redesign the Engemann website. 
Johnson hopes making emergency services more available would prevent situations like those her friends faced from ever happening again, while the online safety courses would teach students how to lead healthier lives. 	
Students are eager to see some of these changes take place. Maansi Solanky, a freshman majoring in neuroscience, said that the website redesign stood out to her.
“I personally don’t know all of the facilities that are provided by Engemann because I don’t think that it’s made very clear,” Solanky said. “I think it would be nice to see the health center be more proactive in making students aware of what services they can get.”
Sarah Van Orman, chief health officer for USC Student Health, said it was clear that Engemann did not have enough capacity to meet the needs of all USC students.
“We just didn’t have enough staff to provide this number of services that were needed, both in medical care, in particular areas, but more importantly in mental health,” Van Orman said. “We don’t have that problem fixed yet, but I think there’s a really clear commitment from the university and … a really clear path to rectify that.”
The campaign also wants to increase the number of mental health professionals available to students and lower the number of off-campus counseling referrals —  a process that can be expensive and time-consuming. Van Orman said that currently, 70 percent of people seeking mental health services are referred off campus, a number that she hopes to bring down to 30 percent. 	
“I was struggling with a lot of mental health issues at my old university, and I was really grateful that my old university was able to address my needs as soon as possible,” Chuang said. “I was actually able to schedule an appointment that week which was extremely helpful for me, but unfortunately, that’s not that case here at USC. It came as a shock for me.”
According to Van Orman, USC is in the process of implementing a plan to increase access to student counseling and mental health services. By Fall 2019, 12 new therapists will bring the student-to-counselor ratio closer to the national recommendation. Currently, one counselor serves 1,700 students rather than the recommended 1,000. 
Along with Johnson and Chuang, candidates Julian Kuffour, Hailey Robertson and Ben Rosenthal prioritize increasing mental health services to address the long wait time to access counseling appointments at Engemann.
Robertson suggested not only reducing off-campus referrals, but also reimbursing students for transportation costs to get there. In addition, she advocates for opportunity funds like those at the University of California, Berkeley, to offset the financial burden on students. She aims to set aside about $100 per person for students who receive financial aid like Pell Grants to spend on USC pharmacy- or health-related expenses.
“It’s a way to ensure that students from a poor socioeconomic background are able to afford treatment and get the care that they deserve without putting a strain on their own wallets,” Robertson said. “I don’t think any student who is already supporting themselves or struggles to support themselves should have to worry that, ‘I can’t afford that drug, I can’t afford that treatment.’” 
Kuffour made it his goal to expand Disabled Access to Road Transportation, a program offered by USC that provides transportation for people with special needs during business hours on weekdays. He wants to increase the hours of operation to assist those with weekend activities or night classes.
“The thing that I noticed the first time I got to USC was that the foot traffic is just absolutely ridiculous,” Kuffour said. “I can’t imagine how that would be for somebody who has different transportation needs.” 
Another issue that both campaign teams are working to battle is sexual assault. Johnson and Chuang are working to implement bystander programs, which train students in different organizations on sexual assault prevention. Kuffour, Robertson and Rosenthal want to introduce rape kit and date rape drug testing services at Engemann.
Robertson pointed out that students who report sexual assaults are sent to the Rape Crisis Center in Santa Monica, a drive that can take as long as an hour. According to Van Orman, it would be difficult to bring the level of specialization this center offers to Engemann — including forensic examination, physical assessments, medications to prevent sexually transmitted infections and pregnancies, counseling for trauma and law enforcement. But for Robertson, the status quo is unacceptable. 
“To have to drive around Los Angeles and be in an Uber alone for an hour after you’ve been assaulted and you’re dealing with all that trauma is just the last thing any survivor should have to go through,” Robertson said.
To successfully push these initiatives through USG and the administration, Rosenthal believes one of the most important steps is to increase student representation on the Board of Trustees. He added that many students are disillusioned with the University after several recent scandals — including reports that a campus gynecologist sexually abused women for decades.
“The administration is oftentimes really hard to change,” Rosenthal said. “Having a student voice within that board would enable more initiatives to get through. We wouldn’t have to jump through all these levels of bureaucracy to get to the highest level, to the point where we can actually create change.”

One big caveat to my column this week: This issue was sent to the printer before the end of the Super Bowl, so forgive me if I left opinions on potentially juicy highlights, such as Tom Brady dropping another wide-open pass or Gisele yelling at Tommy’s teammates for dropping passes or really, any embarrassing thing that may have happened to Brady — I was here for it.    
But regardless of what transpired Sunday in Atlanta, the fact that the Los Angeles Rams played in the Super Bowl remains remarkable. 
Three years ago, the Rams moved from St. Louis to Los Angeles amid an uproar of controversy, and the team quickly became a laughingstock. Interest was tepid. The Coliseum was half-filled. Jeff Fisher was a mediocre head coach. Quarterback Jared Goff was labeled a bust. The likelihood of the Rams breaking through among the throng of professional franchises in Southern California seemed extremely unlikely.
But things have changed, and all it took was a little winning. After a playoff appearance last season warmed up interest, the Rams blitzed through the NFC this season and wound up in the Super Bowl in their third season at the team’s new home. They have found a gem of a head coach in Sean McVay, who turned Goff into one of the league’s best quarterbacks.
Suddenly, local attention is picking up. Suddenly, the Rams are filling the Coliseum, averaging 72,429 fans per game this season. But, even if they knocked off the Patriots on Sunday and claimed a championship, will it be enough to reinvigorate their stature in Los Angeles, a city already stacked with iconic sports teams — both professional and collegiate?
The long-term answer is maybe. The short-term answer is no.
It was easy for me to root for the 49ers growing up. I was born in San Francisco, raised in the Bay Area and quickly aligned myself with the region’s sports teams. I was drawn in by the 49ers and their history, enthralled by old highlights of Joe Montana and Steve Young, Dwight Clark and Jerry Rice. The 49ers earned my support, though, purely out of location. They were in the Bay. I grew up in the Bay. That was it. 
To Los Angeles football fans of my generation, there was no such team, and it didn’t seem like they cared much. The Rams’ move to Los Angeles was not like the Seattle SuperSonics’ move to Oklahoma City, where they immediately became the hottest ticket in town as the lone professional sports franchise. In L.A., there are literally two franchises for every professional sport — NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS and now, the NFL — in addition to USC and UCLA. There were 10 teams worth following year-round before the Rams even came to town.  
In fact, in the week leading up to the Super Bowl, the game wasn’t even the most discussed sports topic in Los Angeles — all the buzz focused on whether the Lakers would acquire Anthony Davis, the NBA superstar who requested a trade early last week. And on Thursday, LeBron James returned from a monthslong injury for the Lakers and stole more headlines. According to Los Angeles Times writer Nathan Fenno, the top six most-read sports stories last Monday in the paper were about the Lakers, Dodgers and USC. Six days before playing in the biggest annual sporting event in the world, the Rams were relegated to below the fold by their hometown paper. 
In Los Angeles, the Rams shoved their way into a crowded elevator, fighting for space. And it is hard when there hasn’t been an NFL franchise in the city since the mid-1990s. When you think football in L.A., you think of Saturdays watching USC at the Coliseum or, to a lesser extent, UCLA at the Rose Bowl. You don’t think about coming back to watch the Rams or Chargers on Sundays.
Aside from the fact that Los Angeles is typically a college football town, many NFL fans in L.A. already have their teams. If you grew up in Los Angeles in the ’90s or early 2000s, you probably rooted for an out-of-town franchise. So why suddenly change allegiances just because the Rams arrived?
But here is the long-term view: Every sports franchise had to integrate itself into its home city. Even Los Angeles’ most iconic teams came from elsewhere — the Dodgers from Brooklyn in 1957, the Lakers from Minneapolis in 1960. Over the course of more than half a century, both franchises developed cultures of sustained success and legacies, drawing in generation after generation of fans. Going through the Lakers’ timeline conjures up memories of Jerry West, Kareem, Magic, Kobe and Shaq, all the way to the present day with LeBron. Look at how many Dodgers are in the Hall of Fame and how much the team’s recent World Series appearances meant to the city.  
I’m not saying it will take half a century for the Rams to develop a fanbase. But it will take that level of sustained success for the franchise to truly find a home in Los Angeles. The upside to playing in L.A. is the large media market and the automatic attention that comes with it. The downside is that in a region so oversaturated with sports teams, the Rams will have to be spectacular for a long period of time before they can even start climbing the ladder to reach the Lakers, Dodgers or USC. 
It all starts with a Super Bowl appearance, though. If they haven’t already, kids in L.A. who have yet to pick an NFL allegiance have automatically become Rams fans, win or lose on Sunday. In turn, they will pass on their fandom to their children, and so forth. And that is where the legacy of the Los Angeles Rams can begin.

After beating then-No. 3 UC Irvine at home last week, the USC Trojans fell in a five-set rematch with the No. 4 Anteaters Saturday night at the Bren Events Center.Senior opposite Karl Apfelbach led the Anteaters with 19 kills, 8 digs and two aces in their 25-20, 25-27, 19-25, 25-23, 15-10 victory over USC. Apfelbach, senior outside hitter Aaron Koubi and junior middle blocker Scott Stadick each put up season-highs in kills with 19, 14 and 11 kills, respectively.USC built a 12-9 lead early in the first set, but UCI plunged forward scoring 6 unanswered points to pull ahead with a 15-12 lead that the Trojans could not recover from.The roles reversed in the second set, with UCI starting out with the lead to set the score at 8-3. The Trojans tied the score up at 19-19, but the Anteaters pulled ahead once again for a 23-21 advantage. USC scored the final 3 points of the set for a win for the Trojans, 27-25.USC quickly racked up an 11-6 lead in the third set, scoring 5 unanswered points. The Anteaters did close in on the Trojans 16-14, but USC never gave up its dominance, resulting in a 25-19 set.In the fourth set, UCI opened with a 5-3 lead, and widened the gap to 17-10, but USC turned it on and tied up the set at 22-22. But the Anteaters finished strong enough to win the set 25-23.The Anteaters came hot out the gate in the fifth set, scoring the first 5 points, but the Trojans weren’t able to catch up, ending the last set at 15-10.Senior outside hitters Ryan Moss, Jack Wyett and Gianluca Grasso led the Trojan offense with 18, 16 and 12 kills, respectively. Sophomore setter Chris Hall and senior libero Matt Douglas led the team on defense with 18 and 13 digs, respectively. Hall and redshirt junior middle blocker Tyler Resnick served three aces each.“Our defensive tenacity was good in comparison to other nights that we’ve had prior to this game,” Wyett said. “Our passing’s been … a staple for us this season and that kind of dictates our play. We came into the game a little bit hesitant, so that’s where we did a good job at bouncing back.”Preparing for the match, USC watched UCI players’ strategies on film. In practice, the Trojans mimicked the Anteaters’ style of play and shaped their defense around it.Wyett said that the Trojans’ blocking schemes and serving at crunch time broke down toward the end of the match. “I felt that we let them get on a couple rolls where we had to fight back a little bit, but we knew we were the better team,” Wyett said. “But sometimes … we would just kind of hang our heads a little bit and then we’d kick it into gear when we had to fight back, rather than just putting our foot on the gas from the get-go.”UCI played two matches in Arizona on Friday before flying home for its match against USC. “We knew they were going to be tired, but sometimes people kind of overlook the fact that once you get into the game, fatigue actually doesn’t play that much of a factor,” Wyett said. “And so, the mental preparation of knowing that we’re playing the No. 4 team in the nation was something that we really had to trust and knowing that our past win also wasn’t a fluke. We’re more talented than those guys.”The Trojans are back home this week to start Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference play, taking on Grand Canyon 7 p.m. Thursday at Galen Center.

After dropping the first game of its Pacific Northwest series, the men’s basketball team bounced back to solidly route the Washington State Cougars in a 93-84 win Saturday night.
The game was over by halftime, as the Trojans exploded to a 47-33 lead and completely locked down the Cougars’ offense. Although the home team bounced back in the second half, outscoring the Trojans 51-46 on the back of sharpshooting from 3-point range by junior point guard Ahmed Ali, it wasn’t enough to chip away at the dominant USC lead.
Saturday was another explosive night for junior forward Nick Rakocevic, who led the team with 25 points and 13 rebounds. Rakocevic bullied his way to the rim throughout the night, out-muscling the Cougars despite their comparable size in the post. On a missed free throw in the first half, he bounded after his own shot and sank a layup in a single step.
With Rakocevic wreaking havoc throughout the paint, the Cougar defense was forced to collapse around the forward, creating open space for the Trojans to move the ball. When the kick-out came, junior guard Jonah Mathews was ready from 3-point range. Mathews’ trademark quick-release shot was deadly from behind the arc, and although he hardly took a dribble on the night, Mathews finished 6-for-7 from long range with 20 points.
The roster spread the points evenly throughout the high-scoring show, with junior forward Bennie Boatwright adding 18 points and redshirt junior Derryck Thornton dropping an additional 12 points. In total, seven Trojans scored on the night, with only two players remaining silent.
The win in Pullman will help the Trojans begin to balance  their road record; they had formerly won only a single game outside of Galen Center while dropping seven losses. The team remains ranked at No. 2 in the conference, but three Pac-12 teams — USC, Oregon State and Arizona State — are all evenly matched at 6-3 in conference play. Washington remains on top and undefeated in the conference after beating both USC and UCLA this week.
Heading into the weekend, the team knew that the game against Washington State was a must-win — as one of the bottom two teams with only one conference win to their name, the Cougars represented a guaranteed win that could gauge the Trojans’ ability to finish games. With this hurdle neatly accomplished through a blowout victory, the team will now turn its attention to visits from Utah and Colorado this week.

Dolly Parton is known for a lot of things: her musical career, her acting, her philanthropy and, yes, her busty physique. But Parton’s public image is also largely formed by her fashion presence, particularly the outfits she dons during her performances. The Grammy Museum is paying homage to her sense of style with its newest exhibit, “Diamond in a Rhinestone World: The Costumes of Dolly Parton.”
Michael Sticka, the museum’s executive director, said Parton will be honored at Sunday’s Grammy Awards as the MusiCares Person of the Year. He said the award recognition helped spawn the creation of the exhibit.
“We felt that having a physical presence that lasted longer than just one night for her fans and for the public to come and see was very important,” Sticka said.
The exhibit, which opens Tuesday, not only showcases Parton’s extravagant gowns but also features her suits and other less traditional costumes. Attendees can walk around the exhibit while listening to Parton’s greatest hits, such as “I Will Always Love You” and “9 to 5” overhead. The exhibit will likely be a big hit for avid Parton fans because it features costumes from specific performances such as her Grammy appearances and “Dolly Parton Live from London.” 
One of the crucial parts of the exhibit was the display of three costumes from Parton’s time on “The Porter Wagoner Show,” a country music television show from the 1960s. Sticka said the evolution of Parton’s style throughout her career is a key aspect of the exhibit’s appeal.
“When you look at [the “Porter Wagoner” costumes], you notice they’re a bit more simple,” he said. “But then as you progress throughout her career you notice there’s a bit more sequins, more rhinestone — they’re flashier and I think personally that they fit her personality.”
The eight-time Grammy Award-winning Parton is certainly an extravagant personality, and that has always been reflected in her outfits. From her rhinestone-laden gowns to her ’70s-style full-denim outfits, Parton has certainly proven worthy of her own fashion exhibit.
“This is our first major exhibition on fashion, so having it be with Dolly Parton is just amazing,” Sticka said.
However, the exhibit lacks the kind of depth that would make it enjoyable for someone less familiar with Parton’s career. The plaques that come with each part of the exhibit simply describe what event and year it came from, occasionally adding in a video of the performance. They don’t explain what made the selection stand out from all the other possible outfits the museum could have taken from Parton’s eclectic catalogue. For non-superfans of Parton’s work, there isn’t much to experience aside from the considerable uniqueness of each costume.
Although the lack of explanatory information makes the exhibit repetitive, there are many colorful gowns which, while they are quite interesting when taken individually, blend together when considering the exhibit as a whole.
There are a few auxiliary attractions that keep the exhibit from being monotonous. The walls are lined with depictions of Parton throughout the decades, including a velvet painting of a young Parton accompanied by a meta photo of the singer playing the guitar in front of the painting. There is also a telephone booth-sized dark room where viewers can watch a music video for “Girl in the Movies,” part of Parton’s soundtrack for the 2018 film, “Dumplin,” starring Jennifer Aniston.
“Diamond in a Rhinestone World” is certainly an interesting exhibit and succeeds in portraying Parton’s flamboyant style. However, there was another level of immersiveness — especially for the casual admirer — that the museum sadly fell short of attaining.

Last year proved to be one of my favorite years for music since I started seriously consuming it. While the mainstream suffered in no small part due to artists like Drake, looking beyond popular music revealed a plethora of experimental and exciting releases ranging from underground hip-hop to noise rock. What surprised me most was that 2018 was the year I started to like country. It’s not my favorite genre, but there were several albums that made me realize there’s more to it than tractors and fake machismo. 
My favorite of these was Kacey Musgraves’ “Golden Hour” — an ode to young love and nostalgia. Each song drips with a passion that unfolds in intricate and breathtaking layers. Whether she’s celebrating the small things on album opener “Slow Burn” or reprimanding a man for his misplaced ego on the groove-heavy “High Horse,” Musgraves blends genres and experiments with the boundaries of what country could sound like today. It was the first album of 2018 that made my heart pound with excitement, and I knew it would go on to make my personal top-10 list the moment I first heard it (it came in at No. 6).
The album debuted at No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard 200. Any commercial success she garnered came with no help from country radio, which has a long history of ignoring women in Nashville. The Billboard country radio airplay chart dated for Feb. 2 shows an all-male top 10. The first song by a woman shows up at 15, “Love Wins” by Carrie Underwood, and in the entire top 60, only eight are by female artists. The 2018 year-end chart for Top Country Artists paints a similar picture, with women showing up on the list seven times but completely shut out from the top 10. Musgraves appears at No. 43 — an impressive feat for someone largely ignored by the Nashville machine and country radio. 
Sexism in country radio airplay isn’t a new topic of conversation, but it is one that has gained momentum. Underwood continues to have her new material played on the airwaves, but she’s an established act. When promoting her album “Cry Pretty,” Underwood called out radio for making it harder for emerging women country artists to make their voices heard. 
“Think about all of the little girls that are sitting at home saying, ‘I want to be a country music singer,’” Underwood said in an interview on the “Women Want to Hear Women” podcast. “What do you tell them? What do you do?” 
Country radio would tell those girls they can make it as long as they start off in pop and team up with a generic, bro-country duo to break airplay records. The biggest “country” smash of 2018 belonged to Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line with their song “Meant to Be.” It sounds like every other run-of-the-mill song listeners associate with mainstream country — complete with drum machine, autotune and oversaturated synthetic instruments. Although I am a fan of Rexha, the song exemplifies every bad songwriting trope the genre has acquired in recent years.
Yet, the song not only became a hit but the biggest hit country radio has ever seen. It holds the record for longest-running No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and even topped the Hot 100. 
“I never thought a New York girl like me would have a country hit, but I guess it goes to show you that some things are just … meant to be,” Rexha said about the success of the track to Billboard. 
I’m sure someone in charge of airplay in Nashville waved their hands in the air and declared the song a progressive step toward evening the playing field for men and women in the genre. However, if the success of “Meant to Be” proves anything, it’s that country has become so exclusionary toward women in country that they are willing to tout the work of female pop stars over the new, truly country talent trying to break into the scene. Rexha has and will continue to find success as a pop performer even when “Meant to Be” is sent to a dark and dusty corner where bland-pop country songs go to be rightfully forgotten. Her moment in the Nashville sun doesn’t help the women who are trying to slog their way past a system bent on shutting them out in favor of an outsider. 
Fortunately, Musgraves has a chance to take home Album of the Year at the Grammys this week despite what’s going on in Nashville. “Golden Hour” is one of the most critically lauded albums of 2018, and it shows what country can be when untouched by the Nashville writing machine. As excited as her nominations make me, I know they probably won’t do anything to change the culture within country music. Awards are often scoffed at by the music community for being out of touch with current trends. To a Nashville insider, the “Golden Hour” love at the Grammys is further proof that those outside of their scene are oblivious to what their listeners consume. They’ll turn up their noses and continue peddling the same songs about whiskey and women without missing a beat.
It’s too bad. They could have something better instead.

As the University prepares to undergo a pivotal leadership transition, it is more important than ever that USC has competent student leaders who are cognizant of the stakes of their positions, passionate about their work and willing to advocate on behalf of the student body. Undergraduate Student Government presidential candidate Michaela Murphy and vice presidential candidate Meagan Lane embody the experience, adaptive feasibility and steadfast values that we want — and need — in our student leaders. 
After conducting interviews with each of the presidential tickets and reviewing their platforms and records, the Daily Trojan Editorial Board endorses Murphy and Lane to serve as next year’s USG president and vice president. Their promise is not only a platform of hope, but a platform of proof. All 26 of their platform points reflect a vision of holistic foresight, tangible action and relentless activism that serves a wide array of goals encompassing community, sustainability and accountability. 
First and foremost, the pair brings an unparalleled level of experience and familiarity with USG procedures. Having both served as senators this year, Murphy and Lane have the know-how and clout within the organization to drive meaningful change — much of which is already underway, a testament to their tireless efforts. 
Although their platform points are numerous and ambitious, the pair has already laid the groundwork as senators and have the authority to see them through. During their Senate terms, Murphy and Lane advocated and saw to completion student-centered initiatives, such as institutionalizing USG’s Diversity Fund, updating emergency contact information on USCards and implementing a campus-wide subscription for The New York Times. Their longer term goals to increase menstrual product accessibility and to rename the Von KleinSmid Center, for example, have already yielded concrete results, and Murphy and Lane are well-positioned to bring other measures to fruition. 
The Michaela & Meagan ticket is aware of the need for culture change within USG and the University, and have risen to the task of being those change-makers. 
Following a year fraught with scandals and antipathy at the University’s most senior leadership level, Murphy and Lane are prepared to hold USG to the same standard of transparency they demand from the USC administration. Rightfully so, they have plans to live-stream Senate decisions, release more detailed minutes of administrative meetings, host external office hours and share USG budget reports to engage the student body and promote transparency. 
Murphy and Lane also understand the importance of continuity at this critical juncture and are dedicated to improving the transition of leadership for incoming and future USG leaders. They are dedicated to training the next group of student leaders, ensuring student concerns are heard and prioritizing projects so that feasible outcomes are reached.
Their community-minded campaign also reflects consideration of the USC community’s need for unity and stability. Key aspects of their platform goals are focused on partnership and communication with various campus organizations to bring student contributions to the larger community.
The Michaela & Meagan ticket is also prepared to hold USC to strict standard, adamant that there is no ask too big or bold for the University. Leveraging their already well-established connections within USG and USC, the pair plans to host round table discussions with the University and promote the student voice through a shared governance symposium.
Above all, Murphy and Lane exhibit an unrivaled passion for civil service, empathy for student needs and drive to finish what they have already started. The Daily Trojan believes the Michaela & Meagan ticket, if elected, will spark necessary change in the campus community through their activist leadership and relentless commitment to student representation. Voters should keep this in mind when they head to the polls this week.
