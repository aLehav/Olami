I’ve always wondered why Americans put pork in everything. Bacon’s too fatty and greasy. Pork chops literally taste like rotten chicken. And pepperoni only serve as mini edible bowls on top of pizza that accumulate oil. 
I was told from a young age to avoid pork like the plague. I never really knew why — just that my family was Muslim and Muslims don’t eat pork. It made me feel cool and unique at times. My friends would have to order cheese pizza for me at sleepovers. Teachers would have to check during lunchtime to make sure that the sandwiches didn’t have any bacon in them. None of my classmates had a perversion to such an American staple, and I honestly liked the attention of having some real culture in comparison to the community around me.
In reality, I’ve never been a religious person. I’ve watched my babaanne, my dad’s mom, pray countless times on her rug. I would even try to mimic her as a child. It was more of a fun game to me, standing up, sitting down, bending into child’s pose, standing again. I had the same attitude towards Ramadan as well. How long could I go without eating or drinking? I never made it too far, but I would watch in admiration as my baba did so effortlessly day after day for a month.
Interestingly, I come from quite the dichotomy of belief systems. My mom, born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, is an atheist to the core. She can’t take religion seriously if her life depended on it. My dad, on the other hand, is from Antalya, Turkey, and is pretty dedicated to Allah. He used to go to camii — mosque — every Friday (the Muslim holy day) when I was younger. His parents have both completed their pilgrimage to Mecca. My babaanne and dede pray five times a day, every day. My babaanne wears a başörtü — head covering. Both grandparents read the Quran every day. This was my normal, at least whenever I traveled to Turkey to visit family.
I asked my parents at one point why they didn’t push religion on to me like many other parents do. My mom responded that she didn’t think it was fair to force me to believe one thing or another. She explained that they did their best to raise me with Muslim-ish beliefs (basically just no pork and one prayer in Arabic), but that ultimately they wanted me to make my own decision as to what I wanted to pursue. I subsequently pursued atheism. 
I am forever grateful to my parents for allowing me autonomy in terms of religious beliefs. Too many times I witness children indoctrinated into a belief system at such a young age that they never know anything different. 
However, there is one issue that has arisen because of the way I was raised. I still value my differences in the face of a nation that is so heavily ruled by Christianity (there is no separation of church and state, contrary to what some politicians may want you to believe), but there are some things that, even as someone who doesn’t claim to be Muslim, I still find myself diverting from.
A perfect example is pork. 
Pork still makes me nervous. Eating pork is haram — a sin — in Islam, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get that out of my head. I inherently don’t believe in Hell or Heaven (even if I did, I know where I’m going for sure), but I have such a negative perception of pork, that even the accidental taste of it makes me recoil. I feel anxious if I consume it.
It does make some situations awkward: “Why don’t you eat pork?” and the following assumptions and ignorance makes me question the intelligence of my fellow Americans at times. Bacon donuts in my eyes are a disgrace to the culinary arts. I’ve never had a BLT. And don’t get me started on how many times I’ve ordered a baked potato or potato skins and have had to sit there, tirelessly picking off the bacon bits. 
This is why I tell people I’m culturally Muslim. Turkish dishes don’t have pork in them; I’ve never had to come across it at home or when visiting family. Similarly, if I ever had believed in a god at one point or another, it was most definitely Allah and not the white, blond-haired, blue-eyed Jesus that Christians praise. 
It’s an interesting caught-in-the-middle situation for sure, but I honestly don’t think I’d have it any other way. My beliefs, however, don’t change the fact that bacon is just gross.

Taylor Clanton currently holds office as the Black Student Assembly’s Advocacy Liaison for the 2022-2023 school year. These are her opinions as an individual, not the opinions of the USC Black Student Assembly nor the Undergraduate Student Government. 
The Undergraduate Student Government proves once again that Black students only matter when candidates are vying to be elected. 
For those who do not know, the USG Legislative Branch has an Advocacy Department. The department holds 15 advocacy liaisons, each one a representative of a different cultural assembly. But, this department is also the reason why there is a fallacy of diversity within USG. 
One change to the Advocacy Department this year was more collaboration with the Legislative Branch, which is composed of senators and committee chairs. In order to do this, each week, advocacy liaisons and senators were tasked with organizing coffee chats with each other. The point was to discuss projects, let senators hear what our communities wanted or needed and just get to know each other. 
It is important to note, though, that a majority of the time the responsibility for scheduling these coffee chats has fallen on the advocacy liaisons rather than the senators, as they refused to reach out to advocacy liaisons — especially most of the senators currently running in the 2023-2024 USG election. Most of the time, coffee chats did not happen if advocacy liaisons were unwilling to take on the uneven burden of reaching out to senators. Oftentimes when advocacy liaisons did reach out, they were met with no reply at all or delayed replies that only led to the meeting being canceled. 
Sadly, the majority of the senators that truly put in the work to communicate with advocacy liaisons and hear about their projects are not running for executive positions. But, at the end of the day, where did that work really lead us? I never met with each of those Senators more than once, and none showed interest in helping the projects that required heavy lifting for the Black community. 
Fast forward to the Presidential Debate on Feb. 16. We got a chance to hear the candidates talk about a range of different issues — issues that affect the Black community — but each seemed to miss the intersectionality of these topics. They talked about sexual assault and fraternities, but there were no conversations on how this disproportionately impacts Black women. They talked about food insecurity, but there was nothing about how Black students are disproportionately impacted. There were comments on affordability, sustainability, funding and much more but it took explicit questions to be posed about the Black community for candidates to talk about them. 
It begs the question, did candidates not talk about the issues facing Black students because they are unaware or because they just did not care? If they did not know about them, all it would have taken was a conversation with me — or really any member of the Black Student Assembly — to shed some light on these issues. If it was the latter, and they simply do not care, then that is even more concerning, as all the candidates except one slate reached out to BSA to campaign to our members. 
Each slate embodies the performative action USG has consistently taken to support the Black community. Almost all of these slates asked for and were granted the opportunity to come to BSA to present their campaigns on Feb. 13. For each, this was either their first or second time coming to BSA. For those with two times under their belt, both were campaign-related. 
At the Presidential Debate, when specifically asked about how they have supported Black students on campus in the past and how that would transition into their support as President and Vice President, none of the candidates were able to provide substantive answers. Almost every answer incorporated some extent of listening to the Black community, but their actions and relationship with BSA prove otherwise. They are interested in “conversations” a week before voting starts, but it all goes radio silent once voting closes. The slates boast about the feedback and conversations they have had with Registered Student Organizations, but this only makes me more concerned. Is BSA not worth receiving the same attention? Is it because Black students on this campus are an extremely small number? Is it because BSA cannot endorse candidates? 
The candidates that are not currently serving as USG Senators scream and shout that other tickets should not use BSA as a means to win the election, but are implicitly doing the same thing. They talk about uplifting the Black community through attending our events, yet lack actual steps to make Black students on this campus feel more welcome — or even safe. All the candidates threw around the phrase “Black Lives Matter” without any actionable steps to make this school better for Black students. It’s disheartening to say the least.
A message for all the slates: The Black community does not solely exist from 6-7 p.m. on Mondays. It is not just the CBCSA. And it, for sure, is not only a community during election season. With your lack of communication and action, you have illustrated that you do not care about the Black community, but rather see us as a way to get elected. 
We have seen this neglect in most of their senatorial careers. We see it in how they answer questions. While it is crystal clear to me, I fear the USC community does not see this performative action, and I fear the candidates themselves do not see it. The only people that probably see this are Black students that constantly deal with these issues. 
Are any of these candidates willing to do the inner work to change this? Are they aware of their own biases to even keep it in check? To recognize their part in hurting Black students on this campus? Or will this get swept under the rug again as we elect our next USG President and Vice President?

After a strong showing at home in early February, the 19-8 USC women’s basketball team headed to the Bay Area and suffered back-to-back tight losses against No. 3 Stanford and UC Berkeley by just 3 points each. As the regular season comes to a close, USC looks to conclude Pac-12 play with a strong home showing against Washington and Washington State. 
Although the Trojans had beaten then-ranked No. 2 Stanford earlier in the season by a score of 55-46, the Cardinal got the best of them by a score of 50-47 in their second matchup of the season. The Trojans shot a season-low 22.2% from the field and 34.8% from the 3-point line in the game. Despite contributions from graduate student guard Destiny Littleton and graduate student guard Okako Adika, who scored 15 and 13 points respectively, the Trojans’ poor shooting ended up being their downfall.
The Trojans did, however, hold the Cardinal to just 50 points, an abnormally low number in comparison to the rest of their games from this season. Additionally, the Trojans held Stanford to a season-low in points scored in a half with the cardinals scoring just 18 points in the second half, with their second-lowest scoring half coming against USC in their first matchup in mid-January. 
However, without sophomore forward Rayah Marshall at their disposal, Stanford junior forward Cameron Brink was able to get into the paint and score a team-high 12 points. In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Head Coach Lindsay Gottlieb says that she is pleased with her team’s efforts in recent matchups. 
“We’re at our best when we’ve got some collective influence going on,” Gottlieb said. “Rayah is really big for us and when she’s on her game she impacts the defensive end and the offensive end. Our guard play is critical postseason [since] it’s a guard’s game and Kadi [Sissoko] was phenomenal on Sunday.” 
Up until their matchup with Stanford this past week, the Trojans were 18-0 when holding an opponent to 58 or fewer points, which is a testament to their defensive efforts this season. USC is currently ranked 6th in blocks per game, mainly thanks to Marshall, who sits at No. 3 in the nation in blocks per game at 3.33. Furthermore, the team is 14th in field goal percentage defense at 35.5% and 3-point percentage defense at 26.4%. 
Although Marshall returned for the Trojans’ game against Cal this past Sunday, the Golden Bears’ high percentage 3-point shooting allowed them to sneak past USC in overtime by a score of 81-78. Despite the loss, the Trojans took away many positives from their second game of the road trip, including graduate student forward Kadi Sissoko surpassing 1,000 career points and Marshall’s continued paint presence. Marshall tacked on 3 more blocks to her season total of 80, the fourth-most by a Trojan in a single season. USC now must turn and look ahead as they face Washington and Washington State this weekend, but Gottlieb feels positive about her team at this point in the season.
“We’ve put ourselves in a position to extend our time with this group,” Gottlieb said. “We’re excited about what is in front of us and what we are capable of.”
Following the Trojans’ first sweep of the season, the regular season’s final games become even more important as the team looks to build confidence going into the Pac-12 tournament from March 1-5 in Las Vegas. Although USC defeated Washington earlier this year in overtime by a score of 63-54, the Huskies are coming off two wins against Oregon and Oregon State, in which leading scorer sophomore forward Dalayah Daniels scored a combined 21 points. 
“Washington is really hot, they are playing extremely well,” said Gottlieb. “They are playing with confidence and we had a tough one up there in Seattle so we’re gonna look to be super focused against them.” 
In addition to Marshall and Sissoko, Littleton’s play has constantly been a huge factor in USC’s success this season as her years of experience allows her to fill a much-needed leadership role on the team. Gottlieb speaks on what Littleton’s play means for her team.
“She’s so high IQ and she’s a really smart player,” said Gottlieb. “She does a lot of different things for us and gets us situated and gets us in our right spots, but we also ask her to make shots. I think her being a little bit refreshed and confident is going to be really big for the end of the season and the postseason.”
The Trojans’ veteran players will be especially important heading into postseason play as they take on Washington Thursday at 8 p.m. in Galen Center.

If anyone happened to have missed the NBA All-Star Game, we have a new contender for “worst basketball game ever played” honors. Well, at least according to Denver Nuggets coach Mike Malone. In his defense, I think it’s a fair assessment. The NBA’s annual All-Star Weekend went by without a speck of satisfaction once again, and at this point it begs the question: how did the NBA manage to make basketball boring?
Team Giannis, led by Milwaukee Bucks forward Giannis Antetokounmpo defeated Team LeBron, captained by Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, 184-175, Sunday. Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum poured in a record 55 points and seized his first career All-Star Game MVP. It’s always been an empty award, but this year feels like the most hollow yet. Half-court shots, terrible dunks and reprehensible play dominated the floor for four quarters. Tatum may have been the game’s “MVP” (the only one he’ll ever get), but everyone on the court deserved to be fined for the deplorable performances they exhibited for a national audience. And if you hate regular season defense, then oh, boy, I hope you skipped this one. It honestly looked like my high school basketball team could put better clamps on those players than the supposed NBA “stars” did. For reference, my McLean Highlanders infamously went 2-24 in 2017.
To clarify, it wasn’t just the actual game — this week’s main event — that put viewers to sleep. The Dunk Contest has struggled to excite audiences for years, and this season’s version may have been the worst offender. Despite posting a roster that featured breathtaking talents and household names like New York Knicks center Jericho Sims and New Orleans Pelicans forward Trey Murphy III, it was Philadelphia 76ers G-Leaguer Mac McClung who captured the title. Yeah, I know. That’s like a minor league baseball player winning the Home Run Derby because, hey, why not. In McClung’s defense, his high school mixtape is always worth a look. I’d just prefer it if someone on an NBA roster – not the Delaware Blue Coats – won the NBA Dunk Contest.
The Three-Point Contest was, well, the Three-Point Contest. Just a bunch of guys shooting at a hoop. If that sounds thrilling, then more power to you. I’d only care if it pitted retired anti-sharpshooters Shaquille O’Neal and Charles Barkley because then it would at least be funny. But to satisfy all Portland Trail Blazers fans out there, I feel I must mention that Damian Lillard won. The Skills Challenge is and forever will be an abomination to the eyes and never deserved to exist in the first place. I’m not even going to say who “won,” because there was no victor; in this case, we were all losers.
Ok, let’s all take a deep breath. I think writing this made my blood pressure rise a little bit. This All-Star Break was not at the NFL Pro Bowl’s level of awfulness. The NFL still comfortably occupies the bottom rung on the American All-Star sports league ladder — but the NBA is quickly descending. But after all, it’s not the players’ fault; the blame lies with the league. They decided to make the All-Star break the trash heap that it is, and it’s not on the players for participating.
With that out of the way, the second half of the regular season looks to build on the craziness of the first few months of NBA action. The Celtics and Bucks headline a top-heavy Eastern Conference while the Denver Nuggets command a five-game lead over the second-place Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference. Every team has about 23 games or so remaining, so the playoff landscape could easily be flipped on its head.
I’ll select the Dallas Mavericks as the most likely second-half riser. They currently stand as the West’s 6 seed, but the addition of All-Star guard Kyrie Irving to a backcourt headlined by MVP candidate Luka Dončić is an insane improvement, and I think their playstyles fit extremely well together. They are both playmakers, but Irving is a great off-ball guard who can sit on the wing as Dončić continues to be the Mav’s focal point on offense. It worked for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, with Irving serving as LeBron’s #2 second-in-command of the eventual Finals Champion. I can see them jumping to the No. 3 seed in the West.
The Brooklyn Nets, on the other hand, will definitely take a bit of a tumble. The East’s No. 5-seed traded away both their superstars (Irving and Kevin Durant) for future assets, and now boast a mishmash of young players with decent potential, solid role players, and Ben Simmons. I think they drop to around the 10 seed, with a chance to make the play-in, but nothing after that. Shooting guard Cam Thomas is worth watching, though. He is lethal with the ball in his hands, and with Durant and Irving finally gone, I’m excited to see what he can do.
Unfortunately for LeBron, the Lakers, even with their flurry of deadline deals, are probably going to miss the playoffs again. This would be the third time in five years that the Lakers fail to make the playoffs with LeBron on the roster. I’d give him one final make-or-break year in L.A. before he sprints out of Crypto.com Arena. A reunion with Cleveland isn’t out of the question, but with Bronny — LeBron’s oldest son and four-star recruit — potentially on his way, I’m sure he’d jump ship to whatever organization drafts him, whether or not LeBron’s final year in Hollywood concludes on a good note.
Finally, the three-horse race that is the MVP will come down to this final month and a half of regular season play. Denver’s Nikola Jokić won the last two, but winning a third straight would require an absurdly-dominant second half performance to overshadow voter fatigue. I think the Bucks finishing first in the East would give Antetokounmpo his third career victory, but if Joel Embiid drags the Sixers to the top, I’d have no hesitation giving it to him. I’m leaning towards Antetokounmpo, however.
The NBA tips off at 4 p.m. on Thursday. In my next column, only a month of regular season basketball will remain, and the stress will be mounting for teams on the bubble.

On a cold and drizzly night at Dedeaux Field, the bats were ablaze for both the Trojans and the Anteaters, but it was UC Irvine who came out on top at the end of the offensive barrage, 8-7.
Although sophomore pitcher Caden Aoki started out the game strong with a one-two-three second inning for the Trojans, it quickly fell apart for him in the third inning. After he struck out an Irvine hitter to start the inning, Aoki gave up two straight singles to set up a first-and-third situation for junior center fielder Caden Kendle. The Anteater veteran laced a triple to earn his fifth and sixth RBIs on the season and give Irvine a 2-1 lead.
Irvine would score another run in the third inning but, after a mound visit, Aoki was able to get two more outs to end the inning. Aoki was pulled from the game after the third inning, but according to Head Coach Andy Stankiewicz, it was not due to his performance.
“He was on a pitch count. He’s coming off a bit of a shoulder deal and so we knew he was just going to give us a start here on Tuesday,” Stankiewicz said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “He did a nice job. He got hit a little bit later. But the most encouraging thing was to see him out there.”
With Aoki out of the game, the Trojans had to rely on their bullpen to get the last 18 outs. Although the relief efforts started out strong, giving up just 2 runs in four innings, the Anteaters broke through in the eighth inning. Kendle had another extra-base hit to give his team an 8-6 lead, which is all Irvine would need on offense to win the game.
“I think [the bullpen was] just kind of a little bit off,” Stankiewicz said. “We were good in spurts, but we weren’t good enough to hold it and to be a little more competitive.”
Despite the loss, the Trojan offense was able to score at least 1 run against four of the five Irvine pitchers. Strong offensive performances have become a trend for the Trojans, with USC scoring at least seven runs in each of their four games this season. Redshirt freshman second baseman Bryce Martin-Grudzielanek led the charge, hitting a bases-clearing double in the fifth inning to tie the game at 4-4. Martin-Grudzielnek added his fourth RBI of the game off a groundout in the ninth inning to make the score 8-7. Despite scoring 7 runs, Stankiewicz wishes his team could constantly produce that offensive pressure. 
“I think we were kind of in spurts. We’ve put some good at-bats together, and then we kind of go. We just gotta be more consistent across the board and just really work on trying to put good at-bats together,” Stankiewicz said. “We had some big swings at times. We found ourselves chasing out of the zone, which is something that we’ve got to work on.”
Part of the lack of offensive consistency may have been due to the conditions for the game, with it being held at night and the weather getting down into the low 50s. This stopped the ball from traveling as far as it would have if it were hit during a warm, sunny day. Junior left fielder Carson Wells was a victim of this when, in the ninth inning, he smashed a ball into right-center field and started to jog around the bases as if he had hit a home run. The ball eventually hit the wall and did not go over the fence, forcing Wells to pick up speed to get into second base safely.
“Usually at night time here, it gets a little damp. The ball doesn’t travel as much,” Stankiewicz said. “And so we understand that’s what we have got to commit to, our line drive game.” 
Despite the loss, USC will use this as a learning opportunity to get better as the season goes on.
“We just gotta keep working, we have a long way to go,” Stankiewicz said. “Good teams win one-run ballgames and so the more we’re in them, the better prepared we are going to be.”
The Trojans will look to get back on track when they travel to Auburn for a three game series later this week. The games were supposed to be held at Dedeaux Field, but were moved to Auburn because of the rainy forecast in Los Angeles.

Nostalgia, the dissonance between the old and the new self, and the transition between places — these are the overwhelming concepts that graduate student Vrinda Aggarwal’s debut exhibit holds steady in one space for its audience to feel. 
The exhibit, which opened Feb. 17 at the Roski Graduate School, is nothing short of a journey through the psyche of Aggarwal’s anxiety when moving from her hometown in New Delhi to the United States. Projected onto the walls, hung from ceilings and mounted on boxes, the multimedia art in “Leave Out” skillfully scatters pieces of Aggarwal’s experience navigating a new life in a foreign place.
The title of the exhibit is exactly what the exhibit is an ode to — the things that are left out from someone as they make a life-altering transition. As noted in the intro text before you enter the exhibit, Aggarwal’s work “interrogates what fades into the background and what is accepted as a new identity.” The way she does this? By taking old, personal scrap materials and turning it into something new. 
“These materials are discarded [because] I have felt discarded,” Aggarwal said. “I’m also not from here, so I’m constantly aware of how my body takes space, and there’s a lot of anxiety that comes with that.”
The first thing you might notice upon entering are two large collages consisting of various papers such as Target receipts and immigration documents hanging loosely from the ceiling. The papers are marred with ink, redacting some of the text, to showcase the old that is left behind or even distorted in order to create space for something new. 
This “botched aesthetic” and the rugged outlines of papers are also a nod to the theme of “geographic displacement,” according to MFA Arts program director Jennifer West, who describes the collage as just one example of how Aggarwal tackles themes of identity and displacement.
“I think a lot of her work grapples with those ideas but in a really interesting and abstract way,” West said. “And she’s oftentimes using her own body in the work … you’re constantly reminded of how we move in the world.”
West, also being on the thesis committee board, has guided Aggarwal since she first started the MFA program at Roski and said that the graduate program pushes students to utilize their interests and backgrounds in order to develop meaningful art — something that Aggarwal succeeded in doing through physical art, projections and film.
“She’s really mastered a lot of different kinds of technology,” West said.
Across the room and around a corner, a projector displays scratched film onto the white walls. In front, bottles with her own hair stand on used boxes — another metaphor for the way we are constantly shedding layers of ourselves.
Other multimedia like a small screen mounted on a white table showcases a vintage video with scenes of her friends and with her alone with the caption, “Are you scared? I’m scared. I’m feeling lost … feeling lost.” 
Cash-Cooper, a first-year MFA student in Roski Fine Arts, shared critique classes with Aggarwal. He witnessed the progression of these ideas to its execution, and described how he was impressed with the final result. 
“I like how intimate everything feels,” Cash-Cooper said. “The pieces draw you in and beg you to come inside the world.”
To Aggarwal, seeing her own exhibit displaying a project she’s worked on during her time at Roski is an indescribable feeling.
“It’s a little bit surreal,” she said. “It feels strange that [the art] are all parts of me in some way.”
“Leave Out” will be available for viewing until Feb. 25.

I try my best to live a well-rounded, cultured life.
I watch important movies; I’ve seen “The Godfather” (1972) or whatever. I read books — my Goodreads continues to present the English major image that I so desire to portray (although don’t look at this year’s list — my beautiful reading challenge list has been subjected to the work of Colleen Hoover). I visit museums and all that good stuff you are meant to do to have a strong understanding of classic and contemporary art.
Even with all my effort, I still have blind spots. The one item on the possibly pretentious checklist that I can’t seem to mark off is documentaries. 
You could possibly attribute my inability to sit through two hours of educational videos to the TikTok “Family Guy”-mobile game crossover videos that have atrophied my brain. But, it’s not really an attention-span issue, and my aversion to documentaries has existed long before such brain-rotting videos.
I understand that documentaries are a powerful art form, and I know that they have made great impact, such as overturning wrongful convictions and creating better privacy rights for mentally ill patients. But, even with all this, I don’t think I’ve ever chosen to watch a documentary on my own. I may be able to force myself through Shakespeare’s entire bibliography (shoutout to the English department for the free books), but I can’t seem to convince myself to watch a 90-minute movie. 
When I do end up watching documentaries, I actually quite enjoy them. Between watching “Paris is Burning” (1990) for Introduction to American Studies and Ethnicity and “Prehistoric Planet” (2022) for my friend who swore it was “so genius,” I truly just need a small push, and I end up having a great time. 
Recently, my push came from documentaries’ funnier little sister, mockumentaries. 
The series “Documentary Now!” was my winter break obsession. I told myself I would take the almost month-long break to watch “The White Lotus” and finally know why the gays were trying to kill Jennifer Coolidge, but, alas, it wasn’t meant to be. Instead, I obsessively watched the show that takes a famous documentary and spoofs it, and apparently, they do it pretty accurately. 
But, I wouldn’t have known that since, out of all the documentaries spoofed in the first 21 episodes, I had not seen a single one. I enjoyed the show nonetheless, but clearly, I was missing the main point. 
Occasionally, the premises of the docs would pique my interest — why was Bill Hader on stage fighting with his girlfriend? But, ultimately, it was never enough to get me to stream the original documentary.
That was until I watched season three’s “Waiting for the Artist” which follows Cate Blanchett as performance artist Izabella Barta preparing for her biggest show yet. Usually, after I finish an episode of “Documentary Now!”, I have to search what doc they were parodying. However, I immediately knew Blanchett was Marina Abramović, and “Waiting for the Artist” was a recreation of “Marina Abramović: The Artist is Present” (2012).
The documentary had been on my Letterboxd watchlist for so long, but as always, I could never make myself watch it. However, watching Blanchett fight a giant rubber band in an attempt to reach Fred Armisen’s character Dimo (a parody of Abramović’s ex, Ulay) piqued my interest to say the least. I thought the entire premise was ridiculous. There was no way there was a line out the door for the opportunity to sit next to Blanchett on the toilet. I assumed this was some absurd dream from the incredibly strange mind of Armisen. 
Still, I needed to see where he could possibly get this idea. After watching “The Artist is Present,” it turns out that the idea wasn’t as far-fetched as I initially assumed. 
For over two months, Abramović sat in an almost empty room at the Museum of Modern Art, almost still. Everyday, just as in “Documentary Now!,” people would line up hours before the museum opened for the chance to sit across from Abramović and stare into her eyes. 
The world of performance art is so unknown for me. I couldn’t believe I was watching grown adults immediately burst into tears once they sat across from her. There were real, intense tears, fully let out in front of a giant room of people. I couldn’t believe it. 
I don’t fault them; I think we should all be allowed to cry in public. I should be allowed to sit in Annenberg and sob without looks, or even worse, people approaching and asking if I’m okay. 
In the movie, someone even got a tattoo to commemorate the 21 times they sat with Abramović, which was a … twist to say the least. Comedic genius Julio Torres even made a five-second appearance as just a regular spectator, which made me more excited than it probably should have — it made me consider the possibility that I am the victim of a parasocial relationship. Throughout the over 100-minute film, I was enthralled the entire time. Abramović’s work is violent, sexual and emotional. And I never would have known that if I hadn’t watched the documentary.
Watching “The Artist is Present” was something I should have done a long time ago; it is probably my favorite documentary of all time. So, while I will probably continue to watch mockumentaries rather than documentaries, my recent adventure reminded me that expanding my viewing habits is not something to shy away from.
Although, I probably couldn’t have appreciated Abramović to the same extent if I didn’t have Barta as a jumping off point.

In the month and a half that has passed since USC Transportation announced its Lyft program would move to a shared-ride model starting Jan. 6, students and drivers alike have dished out their dismay at what they described, in interviews with the Daily Trojan, as issues with efficacy, safety and pay.
Students were previously permitted to take private rides through Lyft for free between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. Now, USC has reverted this policy back to its pre-pandemic shared-ride condition; students can request a ride for themselves and one other companion and are assigned to a pre-existing route — which may include strangers traveling to a different destination.
However, students and drivers have since reported issues with the shared system — or “Shryft,” as students dubbed it — that were not in play before the pandemic. A survey distributed by the Daily Trojan Feb. 4 about students’ use of Shryft garnered 183 responses. Every respondent to the survey said they face longer waiting times since the re-introduction of the shared rides policy. Sixty-four percent of respondents also said that they have had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for a booked ride.
Andrew Lutz, a senior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, said he has faced longer waiting times “every day” since Shryft was reimplemented. After working his night shifts at the Thornton School of Music, Lutz said he waits more than 30 minutes for a ride back home, by which point he often ends up walking instead. 
“USC Transportation has been working with Lyft to improve ride-pairing and wait times this semester,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan Wednesday. “The program successfully completes more than 23,000 rides on a weekly basis. If students need a ride at night we encourage them to take Lyft rather than walk. But if they choose to walk, we recommend they go with a friend.”
USC Transportation will “actively engage with our partners at Lyft to make the program the best it can be,” the statement read. The University did not respond to questions about financial details of the shared-ride program.
In an email to a student, posted to Reddit Feb. 5, USC Transportation wrote that “no one would deny it’s been a transition going back to the pre-pandemic shared model, for both riders and drivers,” but that long wait times have “not been the norm according to the data from tens of thousands of rides performed weekly during [January].” The Daily Trojan was able to independently confirm the authenticity of the email. The user who posted the email, a graduate student studying computer science, requested anonymity citing privacy concerns.
With 98% of students saying that they request less rides since the introduction of the shared rides policy, over two-thirds say that their alternative is to walk home instead. Yet, crime in University Park hit a decade-high peak in October, after which the reintroduction of the shared model had Diya Thapliyal, a junior majoring in computer science and engineering, echoing these safety concerns.
“I don’t have the luxury of waiting an hour, two hours in order to get a taxi to one place or another,” Thapliyal said. “Sometimes that means I have to rely on being on a phone call with someone in order to feel safe [while] walking around, considering the area that we live in.”
DPS did not respond to the Daily Trojan’s request for comment on these concerns.
Lyft drivers interviewed by the Daily Trojan also expressed apprehension. One such driver, Ralph Gustave, who has been frequenting the USC area since July 2019, says that following the reversion he has commonly been unable to find rides even if he has made himself available. He said that compared to the original shared-ride model’s implementation before the pandemic, the reduction in available rides for him to serve was “huge.”
“Before [the coronavirus pandemic] … I used to just take it as a sign to just go home when I had to wait five minutes for a ride,” Gustave said. “Now, waiting 20 minutes for a ride is business as usual.”
Drivers interviewed by the Daily Trojan also said their earnings had dropped since Shryft was implemented. Gustave said that since the implementation of the policy change, his pay has diminished by about 50%.
Rachel Hernández, a Lyft driver of seven months, said that before this semester, a driver could rely on quick back-to-back rides that returned a range of $13 to $26 per hour. The shared feature of Shryft has put a “burden,” Hernandez said, on drivers who are now picking up a few more riders to marginal financial benefit. An hour of back-to-back rides today would earn her $10 to $20 per hour, she said.
“Most drivers try to avoid the area because on a normal night, it is just not worth the money or effort we have to put in,” Hernández said.
In its statement Wednesday, the University wrote that it was “offering financial incentives for drivers who participate in the USC program.” But Hernández said the incidence of these incentives is inconsistent. 
Shryft has affected the way students go about their daily lives, according to students. Mia Lima, a sophomore majoring in communication, said that while she understood the ability to request individual rides as a privilege, she feels that the administration “misunderstood” how often students were using it. 
“I found myself usually taking Lyfts with one or two of my friends either to the grocery store or around campus as a means of safety,” Lima said. “With the Shryft program, it is difficult to accomplish that not only because of the fact that you can only have one additional rider, but also because having additional rider makes the wait times even longer.”
Lima said she was concerned that the inefficiencies of Shryft may exacerbate financial inequities.
“Students that can afford to pay for an individual Lyft on a whim will pay for it if they have the ability to,” Lima said. “But for students who are not in that position, it puts them in increased demand and danger where they’re either forced to wait upwards of an hour for a Lyft or they’re forced to walk around campus at night.”
Lutz said he chooses to walk home from his night shift instead of paying for an individual Lyft as he is unwilling to pay “$15 or $20 to drive a mile and a half.”
“Because of the shared program, it has been a lot harder for me to go to the grocery store. I know I could go into the other locations on campus, but … [Ralph’s and Smart & Final] are cheaper,” Lima said. “Saving money in any way that I can, especially in groceries, during this time of inflation and increased grocery prices is really important to me. The fact that I don’t have the ability to save $10 or $20 on groceries every week is just an additional point of stress for me.”
USC raised its tuition fees by 5% for the 2022-23 year, a decision which has students like Thapliyal questioning if, why and by how much USC is saving by moving to a shared Lyft program.
“Considering how much students pay in tuition and how much money is allotted towards other programs on campus,” Thapliyal said. “Some scrutiny should be given towards the institution for this, especially considering that this was a system that was put in place last year and worked well. I don’t see why they should be increasing tuition and then taking away something from us at the exact same time.”

Accoladed musician, journalist, filmmaker, scholar and professor Jason King has seemingly done it all. He is currently the chair of the Clive Davis Institute at New York University, a position he will leave this summer when he succeeds former Thornton School of Music Dean Robert Cutietta and current interim dean Josh Kun. Over the years, King has conducted a plethora of research on artists and genres. As a published author, he is known for writing “The Michael Jackson Treasures,” as well as scholarly essays and journalistic contributions to numerous publications including Pitchfork, the Los Angeles Times and Billboard.
Outside of education, King is an accomplished entrepreneur, published author, music producer and industry consultant. In addition to managing his own entertainment company, Superlatude, King has worked with marketing firms as a branding expert for big-name artists including Drake, Madonna and Dr. Dre. He has also served as a consultant and curator for NPR, Spotify, Vevo and numerous record labels.
King has an interest in all aspects of music. He was trained in classical piano and musical theater and grew to enjoy hip-hop, jazz, folk music and rock. His experience has granted him vast knowledge in many areas and genres, he said in an interview with the Daily Trojan — as well as theory, history and contemporary movements.
“As somebody who has diversified himself in a great number of areas that relate to music, I hope to bring some of that energy and diversification to [Thornton] itself,” King said. “It’s an interesting model for students who are studying music in 2023 to be able to think of themselves in a diversified way.”
King said he looks to lead Thornton through a new era of innovation in response to the epidemics that have challenged the careers of musicians: The coronavirus pandemic, periods of economic crises and the rise of illegal pirating sites, like Napster, all caused wounds that are still healing.
“We’ve been in a crisis moment for the music industry for the last 20 years,” King said. “Especially in the last few years, that crisis has grown exponential. But yet I still maintain that it’s a moment of opportunity … if musicians know how to position themselves well.”
As students overcome industry hurdles, King said he encourages musicians to take advantage of the flowering of new music and opportunities. As the global recorded music market grows, he believes in substantial opportunities for business, research and commercial success.
“I feel like I have been able to help maneuver the Clive Davis Institute at NYU through those moments of crisis so that we ended up not just surviving them, but thriving,” King said. “So that’s what I’m hoping to also bring to USC — that same emphasis on weathering crisis — and hopefully helping USC build and raise its profile and be on the cutting edge of redefining what it means to be a musician or a scholar of music in 2023.”
Dan Charnas, an associate professor of arts at NYU and author of New York Times bestseller “Dilla Time,” said of King that there was “nobody else like him in the world.”
“He has been my chief mentor, and I think a lot of the professional accomplishments that I’ve had in the last decade owe a lot to that mentorship,” Charnas said. “[For] a lot of the projects I have done, especially [“Dilla Time”], I can trace a direct line back to his encouragement and… his scholarship.”
In addition to his ability to think outside the box, Charnas described King as a “cultivator of relationships.” The respect he has garnered across the industry allowed King to bring the likes of Pharrell Williams, Alicia Keys and others into the fold of NYU as guest speakers and collaborators.
Lyndia Johnson, associate professor of practice, said King was a forward-thinking “Renaissance man” that can offer a fresh perspective to music education.
“He is going to bring a lot of innovation and new ideas for the future of music and music education,” Johnson said. “That shows up in technology, business and inclusivity. He will be Thornton’s first African American dean, so modeling that for the diverse population of students that Thornton has is going to be extremely important.”
That’s what I’m hoping to also bring to USC — that same emphasis on weathering crisis — and hopefully helping USC build and raise its profile and be on the cutting edge of redefining what it means to be a musician or a scholar of music in 2023.
Johnson said she hopes King will help students develop their branding and careers as performing artists, even after they graduate. Before King, there was no template for post-graduates to follow, Johnson said — they went out into the world, auditioned and hoped for the best.
“He will bring some real-world knowledge and expertise on how we can start implementing entrepreneurial ideas, innovations and how we can help support our students while they are here developing their own brand,” Johnson said.
Knowing King’s experience in various departments throughout the industry, Johnson hopes he will help reinforce cross-curricular learning at Thornton, which combines genres and allows for a greater sense of community across departments that are often isolated from one another.
“[A dean] is someone who really brings the community together,” said Beatriz Ilari, associate professor of music teaching and learning at Thornton. “Jason has everything to be able to do it, from knowledge to charisma to experience.”
Michael Burke, associate dean of the NYU Kanbar Institute of Film and Television, described King as a composed and confident leader with a mind for innovation, attributing King’s motivation to his personal passion and devotion to music, education and his students.
“He has an unique ability to take available resources and make them … exponentially expand,” Burke said. “He looks around and sees what is available at the school … He has a very unique ability to take resources to the benefit of students.”
King said he aims to raise Thornton’s national and international profile and imagines partnerships on a global scale. To better understand the school’s needs, he will begin by listening to Thornton’s staff, students and faculty to identify challenges and opportunities for growth.
“I try to lead by example and create inclusionary spaces wherever I go,” King said. “It’s really about serving the students. It’s really about creating the most welcoming educational environment possible. I feel like I have been able to do that at NYU and I really look forward to bringing some of that energy to USC.”
As King takes on the role of dean, he said he looks to continue the legacies Kun and Cutietta left while also creating his own mark on the future of Thornton.
“It is a wonderful inheritance and to be able to step into this job while the Thornton school is at such a high level of achievement,” King said. “I feel like it is a gift. That is really exciting to me — the opportunity to step into something that is already exceptional and take it to even greater and more exceptional heights.”
