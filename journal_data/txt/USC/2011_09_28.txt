Though it is harder to find jobs in California, they are of a better quality, said experts from the Annenberg School’s Center on Communication Leadership and Policy on Wednesday.

Some students are planning to move to Texas, which Gov. Rick Perry claims has a better economy and job market, because they believe California’s economy doesn’t have a place for them.
Panel speakers CCLP Senior Fellow Narda Zacchino and Annenberg Professor and Truthdig Editor Robert Scheer said there were misconceptions about the economies of California and Texas at the “White House 2012: Politics, Media and Technology” discussion series, moderated by Geoffrey Cowan, who holds the Annenberg Family Chair in Communication Leadership.
Zacchino said the emergence of Texas Gov. Rick Perry as a GOP front-runner has increased the number of comparisons between the California and Texas economies. He said a surface analysis renders inaccurate conclusions.
“Texas, with its lower unemployment rate and job growth, appears to be in better economic shape,” Zacchino said. “A closer examination of the facts renders a mixed verdict on the success and failings of both states.”
Some students assume it will be easier to find a job in Texas because the unemployment rate is 12 percent in California and only 8.4 percent in Texas. Zacchino said this falsely attracts those searching for jobs.
“They don’t look at this in context and they don’t dig down deep enough,” Zacchino said.
Texas has the highest percentage of uninsured children and residents without health insurance of any state. Zacchino said 17.2 percent of the population lives in poverty, the fourth highest percentage in the country. Texas also has the lowest percentage of people with a high school diploma.
Zacchino said California’s economic clout shouldn’t be discounted, either.
If California were a nation, it would have the eighth largest gross domestic product in the world at $1.89 trillion, between Italy and Brazil, according to EconPost. If Texas were a country, it would rank 15th, between Russia and Australia, with a GDP of $1.14 trillion.
Sheer said the cost of business might be too high in California, which ranked last in a survey conducted by CNBC, but California ranked first in technology and innovation and access to capital.
“The critical thing is what kind of job you are looking for,” Sheer said. “The jobs that have been created in Texas are largely in minimum wage or below minimum wage. Can you support a family? Can you lift them out of poverty? No. Texas does not provide a model. California gives a better education system and [venture capital] business. What really is at issue right now is the American dream, and the American dream is based off of good jobs.”
Maile Miller, who graduated in 2007 with a degree in  international relations and Spanish, moved from California to Texas to find a job. She currently holds three part-time positions and is applying for full-time work.
“Everyone kept telling me about the Texas economy,” Miller said. “The job search isn’t easy. I kept applying and interviewing and it just didn’t work out, so well, let me try some place new or come back if the economy is better.”
Zacchino said there are some benefits in moving to Texas. Many businesses and business students move to Texas because there is no income tax, no corporate tax on capital gains and less regulation than in California.
Zacchino said it takes longer to get permits for businesses in California than in Texas. Though it might take two to three years to open a business in California, it takes only two to four months in Texas.
Addison McCaleb, a senior majoring in film and television production, said he founded his production company in Texas because it was easier to file paperwork there, even though much of his business is done in California.
“California just has terrible regulations and requires employee benefits that would wipe out a small business, but California has the network I need to make my company successful,” McCaleb said. “The way my company works, it doesn’t matter where my headquarters is, so we have our main office in Texas.”
This is an example of very poor headline writing.  The article does not indicate that USC students should not look for jobs in Texas; it only says they should not believe everything they have read about how great the Texas economy is.  More USC students come from Texas than any state other than California and only an idiot would tell USC students who need a job not to look for work in Texas.  Obviously if you need a job and Texas is your home, or you have family or other strong connections there, you should definitely look for work in Texas.   Moreover, if you need a job, it would be insane to rule out any state, but particularly Texas, which is the site of the headquarters of more Fortune 500 companies than any other state.  If you have an engineering or computer science degree, you will probably find a job immediately in Texas.  If you have a business degree, there is a very good chance you will find a great job here. There are also many good jobs in Texas for communications majors. Furthermore, it takes an average of 2 weeks, not 2 to 4 months, to open a business in Texas. All most businesses need to do is file incorporation papers, obtain an account number (from the Texas Workforce Commission) to pay a very small unemployment tax,  obtain workers compensation insurance (which is optional but strong advised), and, if applicable, obtain a sales tax permit.  The reason Texas has a disproportionate number of people who live in poverty and/or don’t have health insurance is because Texas, which is the state with the longest border with Mexico,  has a disproporportionate number of illegal aliens.  I agree that California is a great place to live but if you can’t find a job there, please don’t rule out Texas, a friendly place where newcomers are always welcome and there will always be jobs for graduates of top schools like USC.
Misleading article in part because it’s based on old data. I have helped software, manufacturing and professional corporations move from California to Texas with staff salaries ranging from $50K to $120K, and employees get to keep more of it because Texas has no income tax. Austin is the single most attractive location anywhere in the U.S. to which California companies relocate, and next year about 2,000 well-paying jobs will move from California to Plano, Dallas and San Antonio. As an aside, as far as comparing the educational systems, note that one in five California high-school students will not graduate. (I had trouble believing this but have since confirmed it’s true.) In my business, I see California companies considering or actually planning moves to Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, Virginia and Pennsylvania. As a Californian who loves where I live, it’s my sad conclusion that this state is in big trouble with future liabilities that exceed that of other states including Texas. Horace Greeley supposedly said, “Go West!” The Census data shows a lot of Californians going East. — Joe Vranich, The Business Relocation Coach, Irvine, Calif.

Most students said the construction of an NFL stadium in Downtown Los Angeles would not affect the USC fanbase, now that the state has taken considerable steps to allow its construction.
Gov. Jerry Brown helped facilitate the creation of a new NFL stadium in Los Angeles on Tuesday by signing a bill that would limit lawsuits that could delay the creation of the stadium.
The proposed stadium would be located adjacent to the Los Angeles Convention Center, 2.3 miles away from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.
Because of the proposed NFL stadium’s proximity to the Coliseum, some students are worried the proposed stadium will affect traffic in Los Angeles.
“[After the creation of a new NFL stadium], the traffic situation at USC and in the Los Angeles area could go from bad to worse,” said Brynne Terry, a freshman majoring in kinesiology. “And because of [its] proximity to campus, traffic could spill over to USC’s campus, which would be an annoyance for all students.”
Some students are worried whether people would chose to attend either a USC football game or an NFL football game, but not both, because they wouldn’t want to pay for multiple tickets.
Kelly Clark, however, a graduate student studying occupational therapy, does not believe this will be the case given USC’s strong fan base.
“USC students and alumni are very committed to their team,” Clark said. “[Students] wouldn’t choose to go to an NFL game over one at their school, simply because of the atmosphere at USC.”
Other students agree that a new NFL stadium would not affect the USC fan base because of the deals USC students receive on football tickets.
“Trojans are die-hard fans, and they won’t stop coming to [football] games, regardless,” said Jennica Hill, a senior majoring in theater. “Plus, the prices [for NFL games] would be much worse than [USC football ticket prices], because of the great deals we get on season tickets.”
If the planned stadium withstands legal issues, construction is likely to begin in June and will finish in 2016, with production costs in the hundreds of millions, according to the Los Angeles Times.

University leadership said it wants to expand the scope of USC’s biggest charity fundraising campaign, “The Good Neighbors Campaign,” after the last academic year was successful, despite the economic downturn.
Donation · The Good Neighbors Campaign supports many community services, including the Neighborhood Academic Initiative. - Kastalia Medrano | Daily Trojan
Leadership announced the upcoming year’s goal Wednesday afternoon at Alumni Park. It aims to raise $1.4 million this year, after generating $1.2 million from donations last year from USC faculty and staff.
Senior Vice President of University Relations Tom Sayles said he is glad the program has been successful even in tough economic times.
“The Trojan family has been so generous, even during recessions we’re able to increase our donations from the previous years,” Sayles said.
Since 1994, more than $12.5 million has been raised for the campaign. President C. L. Max Nikias said the university wants more faculty and staff to be involved with the campaign this year.
“Last year, 35 percent of the faculty and staff contributed to the campaign so just imagine what we could do if 60 percent or 75 percent contribute this year,” Nikias said.
Kim Alexander, senior executive director of development for University Relations, said the university has worked to streamline the process for faculty and staff to donate money online.
“Online donations are going to be much easier this year,” Alexander said. “We’re also increasing our communiqué to faculty and staff to encourage them to donate more.”
The event also showcased the achievements of some of the organizations such as the Neighborhood Academic Initiative that benefit most from the campaign.
The NAI, which provides support to local students through their secondary school education, was also featured at the event. The NAI prepares its students for college with tutoring sessions every Saturday and guarantees a full financial aid package to those who complete the program and are admitted into USC.
NAI Program Director Kim Thomas-Barrios said the money raised last year would allow the group to expand the scope of its program.
“Ninety-nine percent of the kids enrolled in our program go to college and of those, 35 percent get into USC,” Barrios said. “Because of the Good Neighbors Campaign, we are going to be able to add students from the sixth grade onwards, as opposed to from the seventh grade, as in previous years.”
Guadalupe Cardona, a program graduate and a freshman majoring in psychology, said she was grateful for NAI.
“The program was six years of hard work,” Cardona said. “The community really needs help and I’m very proud to be a USC student because of such initiatives.”
Mentors for the program are USC students, many of whom are graduates of the program. Cardona said she plans to be involved now that she is a USC student.
Skull and Mortar conducts an annual health fair — supported by the campaign — where it provides free screenings for a variety of medical conditions and flu shots.
Angela Lee, the program’s student coordinator and a third year pharmacy student, said nearly 1,000 community members attended the event last year and they plan on getting more to attend this year.
“This drive is very useful for the community, as well as for the students [who run it], as it provides free health services to people while giving the students a chance to get some practical experience,” Lee said.
Lee said the campaign provides a majority of the medical supplies and additional necessities needed to hold the fair.
The campaign has given 459 grants that total $11 million to community organizations affiliated with the university and located near either University Park Campus or Health Sciences Campus. A 20-member committee of faculty and staff is responsible for examining grant requests.

SEC has no plans to add 14th team to conference  
After officially welcoming Texas A&M as the 13th member of the Southeastern Conference last week, commissioner Mike Slive is attempting to quell speculation about the possibility of a 14th conference member.
Texas A&M will officially join the SEC next July for the 2012-2013 season, and is reportedly the only school that submitted an application. It is the first addition since South Carolina and Arkansas joined the conference in 1992.
The Birmingham News substantiated an earlier story in the Kansas City Star about an informal agreement that would allow the Missouri Tigers to become the 14th member of the SEC.
The report prompted conference officials to release a statement regarding the article.
“The News, citing two sources familiar with the discussions, said a majority of SEC presidents have endorsed the agreement, though a timetable for the move remains unknown,” SEC officials said. “As of yet, there is no set deadline for adding a 14th member for next season.”
Slive stands by his assertion, however, that Texas A&M is the only addition the SEC is currently considering.
“This has all been about Texas A&M,” Slive said in a conference call to Texas A&M President R. Loftin Bowen, according to CBSSports.com. “We have not initiated any conversations with any [other] institution.”
The SEC will be faced with a number of issues as a 13-member conference, including scheduling problems and whether or not it will decide to add a 14th member in the future.
In addition, the SEC plans to open negotiations with ESPN and CBS to reevaluate and upgrade the 15-year contracts that stand with each network.
“It’s been a complex and intense couple of months,” Slive said, according to CBSSports.com. “There’s also this enormous feeling of satisfaction that the Southeastern Conference has added, really, one of the pre-eminent institutions in the country to the family.”

Emmert voices opinion on realignment
Not only are schools and fans around the country upset with the recent mass movement for conference realignment, but president of the NCAA, Mark Emmert, has his qualms about it as well.
Emmert let athletic directors from all around the country know his stance on realignment at a meeting in Dallas, and was not afraid to show his distaste in unsubtle wording.
“The specter of the past couple weeks of conference realignment has not been a healthy thing,” Emmert said at the meeting. “The world’s convinced that’s all we care about … that all this is about money. I didn’t read many of us stepping up and saying that this will work really well for student-athletes because we’ll do X, we’ll do Y, it will create more resources, it will help us stabilize our programs.”
In addition to his announcement to athletic directors, Emmert also said the NCAA is going to have to make large-scale alterations in “policy” to prevent the realignment debacle from happening again.
In the past month or so, Syracuse, Pittsburgh and Texas A&M have all changed conferences, with the former two headed to the Atlantic Coast Conference and Texas A&M headed for the South Eastern Conference.
Rumors of Texas and Oklahoma joining the Pac-12 were shot down, however, and comissioner Larry Scott noted last week that the conference wasn’t as close to expansion as the media reported it to be.

Pac-12 upholds official calls against McDonald
Pac-12 officials supported official calls against USC junior safety T.J. McDonald during the Arizona State game, league spokesman David Hirsch said in an email.
The three controversial personal foul calls against McDonald accounted for 45 yards in a game that was separated by only one score going into the fourth quarter.
Though there was much discussion about Arizona State linebacker Vontaze Burfict’s “dirty” play prior to Saturday’s game, it was the Trojans who were flagged more than the Sun Devils.
Arizona State had been flagged for 24 penalties for 241 yards in three games prior to its matchup against USC.
The Trojans, however, committed 10 penalties totaling 87 yards compared with the Sun Devils, who committed just six for 78 yards in USC’s 43-22 loss on Saturday. Burfict was only flagged for one personal foul.
USC coach Lane Kiffin did not agree with the calls and voiced his displeasure after the game, defending his star safety.
“When the runner is running at you, and you go to tackle him, isn’t it his job to get out of the way?” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “I really don’t know how you coach that unless you tell him to be a bad tackler.”
Though McDonald was penalized for the calls, he vows he won’t back down from his aggressive style of play in the future.
“After watching the film … what happened is what happened,” McDonald told ESPNLosAngeles.com, according to Pedro Moura. “I can’t change it but if I had to do it all over again I wouldn’t change it. The [penalties were] unfortunate but the fuel that comes behind it, that’s something we can all rally behind.”

Freshman wide receiver George Farmer came to USC from Junipero Serra High School in Gardena, Calif., expecting to make an immediate impact. He was the top wide receiver recruit in the country and No. 3 in the Rivals.com Top 100.
Versatile · Freshman wide receiver George Farmer, a five-star recruit, has seen time at running back with the scout team during practice. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
Farmer hoped to have a Robert Woods-like impact, but injuries plagued him throughout summer and fall camp. Farmer has been relegated to the service team so far this year, but not as punishment.
“George is doing great for us,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said after Wednesday’s practice. “We’ve had a great three weeks with him on the service team. He’s played quarterback, he’s played tailback, he’s played receiver.”
Indeed, the 6-foot-1, 205 pound freshman has been invaluable to the Trojans’ service in imitating some of the opposition’s biggest playmakers for the scout team. But obviously that’s not the long-term plan for the former five-star recruit.
“We’ve actually been putting him at running back in individual [workouts],” Kiffin said. “And he looks great there. So if that could work out … that would be real exciting. He’s a big, physical guy that’s one of the fastest guys in the country. We’re still lacking game-breaking speed back there.”
According to Kiffin, Farmer played running back before he attended Serra, so the position would not be completely foreign to him.

The hottest position battle at practice right now might be for one of the least glamorous: right tackle.
Redshirt sophomore Kevin Graf started at right tackle for the Trojans last week at Arizona State, but looked unimpressive. As a result, the coaching staff has moved freshman Aundrey Walker back from guard to tackle, where Walker began the season as a backup.
“It’s a big adjustment,” Walker said. “I got to learn new assignments, new blocking schemes, coming off the ball with certain steps. And I got to work on my pass protection.”
Walker said although actual game experience is helpful, there is a lot he needs to brush up on.
“Moving to tackle, everything is different,” Walker said. “So basically, I gotta re-learn everything. I had everything down back at guard, but it’s way different when you move to tackle.”
Walker is listed at 375 pounds, but says his weight is actually down to 350. He says his goal weight is 335, and that losing weight has helped.
“I’ve seen improvement in my punch,” Walker said. “And in finishing my blocks as well. On both pass and run.”

Senior Ross Cumming has officially moved from linebacker to fullback, positions he described as near mirror images of each other.
“Playing fullback, you need to understand what the linebackers are trying to do,” Cumming said, explaining that fullbacks are often matched up against linebackers in blocking schemes. “So I have that advantage having played that role.”
Cumming’s move to fullback allows senior Rhett Ellison to return to tight end. Ellison was named to the preseason watch list for the John Mackey Award — given annually to the nation’s best tight end — but injuries forced the versatile senior to move to fullback. With Cumming stepping into that void, the Trojans have a pair of high-caliber tight ends in Ellison and redshirt freshman Randall Telfer.
Kiffin said he doesn’t expect Ellison to return as the starting tight end this week, but didn’t rule out the possibility for later in the season.
—
The Trojans were back in pads for Wednesday’s practice after not using them last Wednesday. But Kiffin said it wasn’t about setting a more physical tone.
“We’re usually in pads on Wednesday,” Kiffin said. “We weren’t last week because we had so many little [injuries] the Tuesday before.”
Just because the Trojans were in pads today doesn’t mean they aren’t getting bit by the injury bug.
Kiffin announced redshirt sophomore linebacker Marquis Simmons will miss the remainder of the season with a neck injury. Sophomore cornerback Torin Harris, freshman linebacker Lamar Dawson, junior offensive tackle Matt Kalil and freshman tailback Amir Carlisle missed practice. Dawson was out of his walking boot for the first time this week, but Carlisle was still sporting one.

If all goes as planned, the No. 1 USC men’s water polo team will play five games between now and Sunday night, beginning with a 7 p.m. match tonight against No. 14 Princeton at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium and ending with a championship match at the SoCal Tournament in Long Beach, Calif.
Threat · Sophomore driver Nikola Vavic, who led USC in scoring last season with 49 goals, looks to pace the USC offense against Princeton. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Before talks of winning their ninth consecutive SoCal tournament gain momentum, however, the Trojans (6-0) must subdue the Tigers — the top-ranked water polo program on the East Coast.
“Princeton has only one loss, and is very well coached,” USC coach Jovan Vavic said. “Two years ago, they made it to the NCAA Final Four where we played them in the first round. I expect us to approach [this]game professionally.”
Princeton (10-1) has only suffered one loss on the season to Johns Hopkins, and has won two matches against top-20 programs, outscoring its opponents 126 goals to 59. The Tigers are led in scoring by an impressive pair of freshmen: center Kayj Shannon, a Los Angeles native, and attacker Drew Hoffenberg, who have notched 22 and 15 goals, respectively. Sophomore goalie Tyler Amina also sports a .590 save percentage.
But the feature event of the Trojans’ upcoming slate of games is, unequivocally, the SoCal tournament. For all of the awe-inducing statistics and figures USC can boast from the last few seasons, arguably one stands alone as the most impressive: eight consecutive SoCal Tournament championship titles.
The SoCal tournament, much like its NorCal tournament counterpart, invites the best water polo teams in the nation to Southern California to square off against one another. Having already won the NorCal Tournament a mere two weeks ago with a 10-8 victory over UCLA in the championship match, USC enters this weekend as the favorite.
“It’s still early in the season, and winning one tournament still means there are 20 games to play,” Vavic said. “If you’re looking to play in the NCAA tournament, you really can’t afford to have more than two or three losses. Each loss becomes huge so we know the importance of the tournament. If we’re successful, it’ll give us a two-game cushion on everyone else, which will set us up nicely for the rest of the season.”
The Trojans begin SoCal tournament play with an 8 a.m. match against Pomona Pitzer on Saturday. Barring an upset, USC will then proceed to play the winner of the UC Irvine and UC Davis opening round game. Another victory would advance USC to the semifinals where it would play either Stanford or Pepperdine. From there, the path gets progressively more difficult, as the Trojans would, in all likelihood, face California or UCLA — in a rematch of last year’s SoCal championship match — in the finals Sunday.
“Each team is a little bit different,” Vavic said. “UCLA is really balanced, they have each position covered. Cal is very dangerous offensively, and Stanford, although we beat them fairly easily the last game, I think they’re going to be much tougher down the road because they play great defense. Pacific may have the best two-meter man in the country.”
Teeming with talent and with no concerns about their ability to perform in pressure situations, perhaps the biggest obstacle facing the Trojans is how teams — most notably, Cal and Stanford — will adjust to playing them the second time around.
Last season, opponents defended sophomore two-meter Jeremy Davie and sophomore driver Nikola Vavic much more closely after the two freshmen proved themselves as prolific scorers at the NorCal tournament. Similarly, freshman driver Kostas Genidounias, an unknown presence before the NorCal tournament two weeks ago, who netted 12 goals over the span of four matches, could also be the recipient of more attention.
Even if teams do direct their attention to the freshman standout, the Trojans’ roster still has plenty of scorers. Junior driver Tobias Preuss and sophomore utility Mace Rapsey, who have tallied one goal and three goals on the young season, respectively, are both due for breakout games, according to Vavic.
“I think Tobias Preuss and Mace Rapsey are about to explode,” Vavic said. “Those guys are much better than what people realize.”

When USC coach Lane Kiffin peers across the field to the opposite sideline Saturday afternoon when the Trojans take on Arizona, he just might be able to learn something from his opponents.
Who should he be looking at? He should be looking at Wildcats coach Mike Stoops.
Now, you might wonder what Kiffin might be able to glean from looking at a coach with a 41-48 career record who lives in the shadow of his much more accomplished brother, Bob. Well, he can learn how to be a little more animated.
Few coaches are more stoic and composed on the sideline than Kiffin, who rarely flashes the slightest bit of emotion. He doesn’t yell. He doesn’t jump. He doesn’t throw his headset. He’s cool and he’s collected. He’s kind of boring.
Even fewer coaches are more excitable than the red-faced, bulged-eyed Stoops, whose gaze of anger will burn through your TV screen. He yells, he screams. He rants, he raves.
Perhaps neither extreme is the appropriate on-field demeanor, but Kiffin could stand to take some of Stoops’ manifest passion and inject it into his routine.
Kiffin’s hesitancy to be demonstrative on the field is understandable. As he continues to flee from his checkered past, he likely wants to do his best to divert attention from himself. After all, the easiest (and often most hilarious) way for a coach to attract eyeballs is to throw a temper tantrum on national television.
Though Kiffin’s antics and behavior might not direct the focus at himself, his gameplan can — as seen in the loss to Arizona State, where he called running plays on three third-and-long scenarios, jeopardizing each of those drives.
But during the last two seasons, Kiffin has been excessively docile, passing over the necessary threshold of caution and coming up dull. Dullness doesn’t seem like the right persona for a coach striving to improve his team.
When Pete Carroll was still at USC, part of the reason he was such a great recruiter was he fostered an on- and off-field environment few could resist. He would cheer on the field, high-five his players, jump on the sidelines and was always smiling. The emotional involvement of the head coach better motivates players to play well, and Carroll was great at displaying that investment.
Kiffin is certainly invested in winning, just as any coach getting paid his salary would be, but the true effect isn’t in the fact that he cares; it’s in how his caring manifests itself.
During games, Kiffin remains stone-faced and calculated, showing almost no reaction to the most exciting plays. The most excitement you’ll see on the field these days is a handful of players on the bench waving their arms on third down in hopes of getting the crowd to support a defensive stop — and most of the time, it’s just a small portion of the student section who obliges.
When redshirt sophomore cornerback Torin Harris returned the block field-goal attempt to seal the Utah win, not only did Kiffin show no signs of celebration, but he also shepherded his players off the field when they started to celebrate the win.
He has to let his players have some fun out there.
Moreover, a stern (while not overbearing) coach seems more likely to promote discipline and limit errors and poor decision-making by the team. Kiffin has done well to make over the program off the field, instituting strict penalties for unacceptable behavior and awarding patches for academically excellent players. But he doesn’t seem to value accountability to the same degree on the field.
If Kiffin were to scold and yell at players who make mistakes or commit penalties, it might dissuade players from making further errors. It certainly can’t be any less helpful than the silent smirk of disappointment he typically sports when players jog off the field after a miscue.
Stoops is always in players’ faces, causing them to have night terrors on a regular basis. Kiffin doesn’t need to get on that level, but some vocal encouragement and hype would be appropriate to get the team in the right frame of mind.
So when sophomore cornerback Nickell Robey gets beat by receiver Juron Criner this Saturday, or senior tailback Marc Tyler fumbles the ball or junior safety T.J. McDonald puts on his Taylor Mays hat and puts a late licking on a poor Wildcats runner, Kiffin should be in their ears.
And when junior quarterback Matt Barkley throws a 55-yard touchdown pass to sophomore receiver Robert Woods, he should congratulate them — loudly.
It’s time he made Trojans football fun and exciting again.

Everyone has his own style. His record thus far is commendable.
Remember that everyone wanted Pete Carroll to resign the first few years that he started at USC.
Lane is a great person & a good (young) coach. Let him develop & do better than he’s already done.
You may end up eating your caustic criticisms of him.
Your article hit it right on the head….we watch our Trojans from the Bay Area and cannot believe there is any life…he pays more attention to his laminated play list than the very players or situation that they find themselves…wake up Kiff!
That’s right….maybe he needs to read the 3 minute manager.

Following his third-quarter fumble against Arizona State on Saturday, with USC trailing 28-22, senior tailback Marc Tyler acknowledged the significance of the play.
Carrying the load · Despite being suspended for the first game of the season, senior running back Marc Tyler leads all USC tailbacks with 303 rushing yards. The Trojans, however, are still trying to find another back to compliment Tyler in the backfield. - Brandon Hui | Daily Trojan
The Trojans started the drive at the Sun Devils’ 49-yard line. It cost them a potential scoring opportunity. It gave the ball back to Arizona State, which would eventually go on to score two more touchdowns in a 21-point rout.
“They didn’t have the energy they had in the first half,” Tyler said. “We had all the momentum, and then [my] fumble turned it around … You can’t win on the road like that.
Through three games, Tyler, who missed the team’s season opener Sept. 3 against Minnesota because of a suspension, has rushed for 303 yards and two touchdowns on 61 carries. But his performance, at least as of late, has been overshadowed by his fumble in last week’s loss to Arizona State.
“[It] was a momentum killer,” USC offensive coordinator and running backs coach Kenny Polamalu said. “He got careless and got hit from behind.”
The fumble, however, doesn’t paint the whole story for Tyler — at least according to Polamalu.
“He’s a solid running back,” he said. “He does everything for us. He runs, catches, blocks. He’s very trustworthy.”
Despite the turnover, Tyler has nestled into his role as the team’s starting tailback, although he missed most of training camp. Averaging five yards a carry, he is on pace to become just the program’s second 1,000-yard rusher since 2005.
But in large part, instability has seemingly defined the Trojans’ backfield this season, as five different tailbacks have carried the ball, but only Tyler has done so more than 30 times.
Redshirt freshman D.J. Morgan, who started the team’s opener, has logged just nine carries since Tyler returned to the lineup Sept. 10 against Utah. And since fumbling against the Utes, Morgan has carried the ball just once — a fumbled carry that went for minus-two yards the following week against Syracuse.
“It’s maturity,” Polamalu said, when asked about Morgan’s drop in playing time. “He was the star in high school and we told him here you can’t be casual. Here, you do your job and do it right and you’ll get an opportunity.”
With Morgan seemingly relegated to the bench, Polamalu and USC coach Lane Kiffin, remain in search of a No. 2 tailback to pair with Tyler.
Against Arizona State, freshman Amir Carlisle, who starred for much of training camp, was the first off the bench to spell Tyler, but in the second quarter, the Sunnyville, Calif., native re-injured a high-ankle sprain sustained last month, leaving USC with even fewer options in its backfield.
“I thought he looked good and gave us a spark there with a little bit of speed,” Kiffin said of Carlisle, who rushed for 14 yards on two carries. “He had a great week of practice. I actually thought Amir was going to have a real big game.”
As of right now, Carlisle’s status remains unknown for Saturday.
Junior tailback Curtis McNeal is currently listed as the team’s backup, along with Morgan and sophomore Dillon Baxter, and could slide into the team’s No. 2 role after logging the second-most carries against Arizona State.
“[McNeal’s] right next to Marc,” Polamalu said. “He’s very trustworthy. Curtis is a complete player in terms of knowing our system and structure. Marc and Curtis do things really well for us.”
But because of his similarities to Tyler, McNeal, despite his smaller 5-foot-7 frame, is more of a blocking back and often prefers to run between the tackles, so it could be harder for him to crack that role.
“As long as Marc is healthy, it’ll be hard for Curtis to see more time,” Polamalu said. “The other guys [Morgan and Baxter] are more role guys.”
But despite being categorized as a role player, Baxter hasn’t had much of a role this season. Through four games, the once five-star recruit has touched the ball just 11 times for 31 yards on the ground and one yard through the air.
“We’ve gotten to a point where the ball is spread to Robert Woods and the tight ends so that running back role has a diminished role where it’s protecting and running the ball,” Polamalu said of Baxter, who has been used as dual-threat tailback in the past.
Though the Trojans have relied more on the passing game with 150 pass attempts compared to just 128 on the ground, Polamalu feels pleased with the young group’s efforts moving forward.
“We’re still working to get better,” he said. “We’re not there yet but I like their attitudes about putting the work in and doing things right.”

Los Angeles is seen as many things: cultural hotspot, nightlife hub, entertainment capital.
Missing from that list is “legendary art center.” The cities more likely to come to mind are the traditional bastions of art like Paris and New York City.
Looking to change that perspective is a 60-plus museum and gallery collaboration aptly named “Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.”
The program features a dazzling collection of artists and pieces with the hope of exposing the artistic vibrancy of post-World War II Los Angeles. The program officially begins Saturday and a number of institutions — from the Los Angeles County Museum of Arts to the Hammer Museum to LA><Art — will offer free admission Sunday.
The six-month-long program should prove an enticing playground for art lovers, with everything from light sculptures to photographs to paintings. The program will also feature exhibitions by well-known artists such as Judy Chicago and Chuck Close.
The program, as with any single art exhibition, will have major costs, but The Getty has been generous with its financial support. The Getty gave $2.7 million to local museums to help with the exhibitions and supplied $7 million for the planning and research of the exhibition and upcoming performance-art festival. The Getty also funded an advertising campaign featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers’ lead singer Anthony Kiedis chatting about art with prominent American Pop artist Ed Ruscha.
These sweeping efforts stem from the fact that creating — and investing in — such a huge project is risky. The art world, unfortunately, is not quite fully merged with mainstream culture. The large advertisement effort proves The Getty is also trying to reach a larger audience than the usual art lovers and to entice it into visiting Los Angeles’ museums and galleries.
By emphasizing Los Angeles as a legitimate art center, the program also hopes to reach out to tourists who would normally visit places like New York and Paris to get their art fix.
If the parties involved play their cards right, the initiative could very well attract a large number of people outside of the usual circle of fervent art lovers. “Pacific Standard Time” could ride the wave of momentum that has stemmed from popular Los Angeles art events such as the recently closed “Art in the Streets” exhibition and the monthly Downtown Art Walk.
In fact, “Pacific Standard Time” would be wise to recognize the natural curiosity of the Angelenos who have a budding curiosity in art. The program is admirable for focusing on amping up Los Angeles’ reputation as an international center of art, but it should be noted it’s the locals, not the tourists, who can take advantage of what the city has to offer.
Though the title “Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980” might sound like a history textbook, the enormous variety of works from so many different galleries should excite and intrigue gallery-goers. In fact, many of the exhibitions work to capture the heart of Los Angeles and the spirit of many historic moments.
“Dennis Hopper: Vintage Photographs from the ’60s” at Craig Krull Gallery in Santa Monica is a perfect example of this. In Hopper’s photographs, you can see a gritty, Instagram-like style that was created without the help of the now-popular iPhone application.
With art from feminist, African-American and Chicano artists, “Pacific Standard Time” is also conscious of addressing the cultural diversity of the city.
“Pacific Standard Time” is risky in its ambition, but its undertaking alone proves that Los Angeles has an artistic energy that should be appreciated by both tourists and natives alike.

From the moment the lights went up, Poor Behavior vibrated with an electric, tense and fast-paced energy that perpetuated the show from beginning to end. Center Theatre Group’s newest original play, written by Theresa Rebeck and directed by Doug Hughes, left audience members keeling over in laughter, gasping with shock, gripping their seats in horror and silently sobbing with heartbroken empathy.
Realist encounter · Rebeck’s latest production, Poor Behavior, is staged in a country home, and features two couples engaged in a philosophical debate, on the meaning of “goodness.” Many of the scenes incorporate witty dialogue, filled with double entendres and realistic confrontations. - Photo courtesy of Craig Schwartz
The events that unfold in one immaculately decorated country home kitchen over the course of a weekend between four good friends explore human emotion, walking the fine line between the exposition of intensely raw human truth and the exaggeration of extreme human behavior.
The show in its entirety, however, portrays phenomenal character arcs, punctuated by exquisite moments of emotion, engendering an intense, fervent response from even the most unenthusiastic theatergoer.
The play gets off to a quick start as the audience is thrust into the middle of a wine-induced argument between a pompous British man, Ian (Reg Rogers), and a strong-willed American woman, Ella (Johanna Day), as their spouses watch in subdued horror, futilely attempting to intervene.
The argument, addressing the meaning of “goodness,” is loaded with double entendres that subtly foreshadow the impending chaos and drama.
Ella and her polite and endearing, yet naïvely ignorant, husband Peter (Christopher Evan Welch) host the other couple, Ian and his emotionally unstable wife Maureen (Sharon Lawrence) for a weekend getaway at their country home in Ohio.
The setting seems innocent enough, but the initial drunken duel between Ella and Ian sparks a cataclysm of suspicion, betrayal, lies and broken hearts, enticing viewers with twisted yet enthralling behavior.
The following morning  the audience witnesses a peeved Peter, angered and embarrassed by his wife’s inebriated production, and a basket case Maureen, distraught that her husband elected to spend the evening in a heated fight with another woman rather than come to bed with her.
It doesn’t take long for Maureen to accuse her husband of having an affair with Ella, an allegation Ian masterfully sidesteps with the response, “I don’t deny it [the affair],” enabling a blazing fire of doubt and mistrust for Peter in his wife’s fidelity.
The play, which takes place over two evenings and one very long day, is truly a story of deflection and subtext as so little can be said within the limited time frame, while so much is still communicated. The majority of the conversations that occur center around muffins, tea, coffee and water pressure, but all of these items merely attempt to mask biting, accusatory and often painful topics with a guise of normalcy.
Only a brilliant script and impeccable acting can transform a curt comment about muffins into a contemptuous personal character attack, leaving the audience experiencing both disbelief and understanding.
Rebeck crafts her characters meticulously and masterfully, but it is the cast that brings them to life as extraordinary paradigms of dynamic, lively people. For instance, Ian, whose callous humor and proclivity fan the flames of turmoil, drives the dramatic structure of the play, and uses his self-deemed superiority over Americans and irrefutable wit to dodge and deflect any and every sticky situation in a hilariously offensive manner, leaving the audience simultaneously wanting to cheer for him and to smack him upside the head.
Ella, the unanimous audience favorite, retains a similar charm mixed with a sarcastic intelligence and strikingly realistic gusto about her that engenders audience sympathy even in light of scathing accusations against her.
Her husband Peter, on the other hand, has the most defined character arc, transforming from a boyish, naïve, drama-avoiding husband into a powerful, capable and wronged man whose fury alone ignites the gut-wrenching climax of the play.
The only mild disappointment surfaces in the character of Maureen, whose constant sobbing and profuse mood swings seem cartoonish and over-stereotyped, even for the “crazy” character.
The brilliant script and precise directing are irrefutable, but it is the overwhelming sensation of human truth infused in the show that catapults Poor Behavior into the ranks of excellence.
Impeccable comedic timing and irresistibly defined characters make the play a thoroughly enjoyable experience, but the glimpses of dejection, betrayal, hopelessness and lust that permeate the humor haunt the audience with the unmistakable sensation that this is real, this is truth.
Poor Behavior is playing at the Mark Taper Forum through Oct. 16.

For some, nothing sounds nicer than sitting in an armchair and reading poetry while listening to soothing music. Visions and Voices attempted to provide such a night with “An Evening of Poetry and Music with Dana Gioia.”
When viewers first entered Bovard Auditorium on Tuesday night, they noticed comfy armchairs with a small table between them, foreshadowing the comforting evening planned ahead.
USC president C. L. Max Nikias introduced the guest of honor for the evening, Dana Gioia. Gioia, a Los Angeles-native, is an award-winning poet and served as the Chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts.
Kevin Starr, a university professor and associate dean of the USC Libraries, interviewed Gioia about his experiences in the NEA and his views on poetry.
Gioia used dry wit to entertain the audience and his love of the Los Angeles area to win their respect. Despite his fame, he appeared to be like anyone else in the audience. Gioia mentioned how he got the Congress to support the NEA through sympathy and personal experience. He spoke to them just as he spoke to the audience. His down-to-earth demeanor portrayed him as a passionate man — and his passion is the arts.
Poetry has also been a strong part of Gioia’s involvement with the arts. He declared one of the reasons he stepped down from the NEA is because he had no time to write, which he greatly missed.
He even admitted he was afraid to become a teacher because he believes the classroom and students occupy the imagination and could possibly deter him from writing. He spoke ardently about poetry and culture, believing poetry to be a “primal power” and culture “renews life as we grow old.”
Gioia’s humor and personable charm shines through in his poetry, allowing the audience to fully engage in his work. Following the interview, Gioia’s vivacious personality continued to amaze viewers as he offered four captivating and casual, yet refined short poems and a narrative poem with the audience.
The majority of Gioia’s poems reflected stories from his life, such as “Cruising with the Beach Boys,” a nostalgic poem that sings the praises of Los Angeles, and “Planting a Sequoia,” a sad poem combining Gioia’s appreciation for his Sicilian traditions and remembrance of the death of his four-month-old son.
Gioia surprised audience members by reciting his poetry, with the exception of his narrative poem, by memory. Gioia said he believes poetry should come from the heart and that the main muse in art is memory.
Enabling this deep connection between poetry and the heart was the emotive music of the evening, provided by composer and pianist Morten Lauridsen, along with baritone singer Rod Gilfry.
Lauridsen composed two songs for the night, using James Agee’s poem “Sure On This Shining Night” and Gioia’s “Prayer” as the lyrics for the music. The juxtaposition of Lauridsen’s soft, slow music and Gilfry’s operatic voice combined with the dark text from both Gioia and Agee’s poems created two beautiful, yet haunting melodies.
Gioia presented two concluding poems with humor and observation. His first poem spoke of a love story between an older male and younger female, both of whom are cats, and the cat take on the relationship. A comedic flair comes to light when surprise, surprise — the young female is in heat.
By contrast, the second poem, entitled “The Lunatic, The Lover, and The Poet,” renders a more serious tone as it observes the commitment issues involved with long-term love, mesmerizing the audience with his ability to switch from the comedic to the dramatic.
The evening, in its entirety, served to encourage students to engage in the arts, to fulfill our creative potential and to experiment artistically.
In Gioia’s words, “We must have faith that we can create culture in our community.” Now we must put that faith into action.

Odd Future at The Palladium
The nihilistic, hip-hop collective Odd Future will be making its way to The Hollywood Palladium tonight as part of its Golf Wang concert tour.
Known for its controversial lyrics, dark subject matters and edgy producing, Odd Future has garnered more attention and hype over the past few years. Though the collective — which is full of talented and audacious artists — is young, the crew has proven to be fearless in the face of the media and its hip-hop competition, meeting the expectations that come hand-in-hand with hip-hop hype.
Odd Future has also proven its ability to put on highly energetic and free-wheelingly reckless shows — as seen in its famous Jimmy Fallon and MTVu Woodies appearances. Odd Future’s members, including front man Tyler, the Creator, who recently won Best New Artist at the MTV VMAs; rappers Hodgy Beats, Domo Genesis and Mike G; producers Left Brain, Syd the Kyd and Matt Martians; and singer Frank Ocean are guaranteed to put on an enthralling show that will leave audience members speechless.
Be sure to pick up tickets while they are still available at LiveNation.com.  The show tomorrow is at The Hollywood Palladium at 8:00 p.m.
Jane Lynch & Adam Scott at Club Nokia
World-renowned character actress Jane Lynch will visit Club Nokia Sunday, courtesy of Live Talks Los Angeles. Lynch will be joining Parks And Recreation star Adam Scott to discuss her new memoir Happy Accidents.
Lynch slowly climbed the comedic latter to stardom, starting with commercials and short-but-notable roles in films such as The 40-Year Old Virgin and Talladega Nights but has recently landed in a powerhouse position with her most acclaimed role as Glee’s Sue Sylvester.
Lynch’s memoir details her unlikely but hilarious path to comedic popularity through a series of literal accidents and chance encounters, like a meeting at a coffee shop that led to Lynch’s riotous role as a lesbian dog trainer in Christopher Guest’s mockumentary Best in Show.
If you’re a fan of Lynch, and want to know more about her road to success — or her new memoir — be sure to check out ticket prices at events.la.com.
L.A. Oktoberfest
Wunderbar! L.A. Oktoberfest is finally here and it is back with a bang.
The event will feature a range of German beer, from Weltenburg Hefeweizen to Barock Dunkel, wines such as Neumeicter gruber and Schmitt’s Kinder and traditional food like sauerkraut and an assortment of sausages.
There will even be live entertainment including cover bands ranging in genre from R&B and classic rock to new wave and alternative. Yes, they will be cover bands, but with a few of those traditional German beers in your system, they’ll be just as good as the originals.
As an added incentive, beer maidens will be sprinkled throughout the festival, traditional garb and accents in tow.
Events begin this Saturday, Oct. 1, and run through the rest of the month, but tickets are selling out quickly so grab your credit card, put on your lederhosen, channel your inner German and prepare for a uniquely cultural experience.
A Revolutionary Project: Cuba from Walker Evans to Now 
The culturally infused photography of “A Revolutionary Project: Cuba from Walker Evans to Now,” currently on display at the J. Paul Getty Museum, focuses on the events surrounding the 1959 Cuban Revolution.
Walker Evans’s 1933 works are interestingly juxtaposed against the pieces of contemporary photographers like Virginia Beahan and Alexey Titarenko, demonstrating the similarities and differences between old and modern Cuba and the shifting perspectives toward the country.
One notable segment includes a selection of photographs looking out through the world-famous Cuban cars, allowing viewers to get the perspective of the driver and fully immerse themselves in the setting of the work.
Other interesting pieces, for example, explore raw, human emotion through up-close and personal portraits of prostitutes. The infamous and fascinating Che Guevera and even Fidel Castro himself make appearances in a majority of the works, as well.
With its cultural insight and interesting perspectives on the intriguing history of Cuba and its inhabitants, “A Revolutionary Project” is not one to be missed. Catch a little glimpse of Cuba before this enticing and culturally insightful exhibition leaves this Sunday.

It is not often one gets to witness a one-person show, much less an entertaining one. Nevertheless, despite minor ups and downs, Pigeon, the latest one-woman play by Claudia Stevens, took flight at the Ronald Tutor Ballroom on Tuesday.
Leading lady · With convincing acting and a carefully sculpted dialogue, Claudia Stevens shines in her own mono-character play, giving audience members a unique ride filled with witty remarks and an intriguing agenda. - Photo courtesy of USC Spectrum
The play’s topic is grim, featuring strong indictments of human cruelty to animals, but Stevens, a playwright and actress, has the experience to handle it. A graduate of Vassar College, University of California, Berkeley and Boston University, Stevens studied piano, singing, acting and composing before turning her attention to playwriting. Since then, she has written 15 musical solo plays that have been performed throughout the United States.
Pigeon, her latest creation, follows a lecture of environmental advocate Dame Miriam Rothschild, who, before her advocacy for animal rights, killed and dissected pigeons during World War II. The play poses questions like, “Under what conditions is it okay to kill animals?” and “Is a human life worth more than an animal’s?” Taking the stage solo, Stevens attempts to answer these questions.
“[The piece] starts with the glories of nature,” Stevens said. “Then we look back and see how dark the story really is.”
Stevens got the inspiration for the play from friends at Cornell University who were familiar with Dame Miriam Rothschild. One of her friends, the late Thomas Eisner, suggested Stevens make her the subject of a play.
“The Cornell folks, knowing about some of the other things I had done said, ‘Oh, this is something you should look into,’” Stevens said. “And so I did.”
For the most part, the play is strong, and at times, deeply moving. There are moments of potential awkwardness when the music gets too loud or when the audience refuses to respond to Stevens’ questions, but Stevens herself performs well.
Though her acting is convincing, her lines appear too rehearsed at times. She assumes a consistently convincing British accent that never once falters, and adopts the slight stoop of a woman in her seventies, commanding the attention of the audience with her authenticity.
Though she has no one on stage to play off of, Stevens creates her own energy. She calls on audience volunteers, uses a well-crafted score accented with pigeon calls and relies on her own stellar, operatic vibrato to add a musical element to the piece.
In addition to great sound and visual design, the play is well-written. Though it might go over the heads of some unfamiliar with World War II or historical figures of the period just before 1984, the monologue is natural and consistent, keeping with Stevens’ senior-like persona. Stevens has moments when she is haunted, wise and comical; she makes herself a fully developed character.
The play also ensures that the audience, if it was unsympathetic to the cause before, realizes just how sickening animal cruelty can be. Through aptly-timed graphic descriptions, Stevens describes how exactly the pigeons were killed.
According to the play, the “humane” way to kill a pigeon is to separate its head from its spine by putting the bird’s body behind its shoulders and pulling it into two separate directions — that way, the death is purported to be painless.
The pigeon killing was supposed to save the cattle population from disease and, as a result, to save the starving British citizens who were supposedly suffering during the blockade.
“Apparently Rothschild was in favor of doing this very quick and painless task,” Stevens said. “But her conscience was not completely clear. Toward the end of her life, she would never even kill an insect.”
But before the audience feels too distanced, Stevens turns back around and points her finger at the viewers, asking audience members to recall times when they, as children perhaps, were cruel to animals for curiosities sake, to simply see what would happen.
“We live in a world that’s not simple,” Stevens said, as Rothschild. “It is full of contradictions. We are full of contradictions.”
The state of the human versus animal debate today is at the crux of Stevens’ play.
“It’s a mixed picture, but I think we have become more fully human,” Stevens said. “We don’t do wanton killing anymore, but we have to somehow put a brake on ourselves to prevent us from doing truly dreadful things. But there is a possibility in our nature though we’re not over that hill yet.”

On Sept. 23, the state of Georgia executed Troy Davis for the murder of a police officer. Some believe the execution showed a foul disregard for the legal process. Others believe the court system was rightfully doing its job.
Jovanna Tosello | Daily Trojan
Both sides agree on one thing, though: The topic belongs on Facebook.
Facebook advocacy is a tricky topic.
On one hand, it’s great to see people paying attention to social problems. In many ways, Facebook is the perfect tool for spreading awareness. The audience is built in, and it’s there voluntarily.
On the other hand, Facebook advocacy — like all forms of advocacy — demands an awareness of context and manner. That’s the part where many Facebookers drop the ball.
Whereas the Davis case has been generating thoughtful debate and discussion, other Facebook trends that were supposed to raise awareness about issues such as breast cancer or child abuse have failed.
Facebook is so easy to use that many people post as casually as they speak, forgetting they’re communicating to the equivalent of a massive lecture hall. Posting about charged issues isn’t like posting about the weather. Users who don’t think through their use of advocacy risk trivializing problems that deserve to be taken seriously.
One of the most popular issues to post about is cancer. It’s understandable; many people have lost loved ones to the disease.
Why treat something like cancer less seriously than capital punishment? These are two serious topics that deserve serious responses. Unfortunately, the way people post about cancer on Facebook makes searching for the cure seem like a fun trend.
At this time last year, for example, you might have noticed a lot of women posting statuses such as “I like it on my desk,” or “I like it in my closet.”
“You like what, where?” men asked.
“It” was a purse. Of course, almost no one cares about where people store their belongings so posters conveniently replaced the noun with a pronoun. Voilà — the statuses suddenly garnered national media coverage. And this was all supposed to be about breast cancer.
There is one glaring problem with the campaign’s strategy, though. It wasn’t actually designed to spread awareness. In fact, a big part of the campaign involved keeping the opposite sex in the dark.
I vividly recall hearing a guy asking a group of female students what the statuses were really about. The ladies laughed and refused to answer. What, then, was the point? Where was the context?
I’m not against the innuendo. The “I like it” campaign could have kept its mystique, but it should have  built in a call to action. Women would have only needed to include a link to a donation site in each status.
Considering how effectively these statuses garnered attention, many people would have clicked that link. The National Breast Cancer Foundation could have really made money — if only the campaign hadn’t been carried out like a giant inside joke.
The Davis debacle, on the other hand, received a dignified reaction, which led to action and protest in the real world, as opposed to digital activism.
Cancer is not the only issue that has suffered from advocacy without context. Earlier this year, people decided to raise awareness for child abuse by replacing their usual profile pictures with drawings of their favorite cartoons.
That was literally it. The vast majority of people who participated in this campaign provided no information on child abuse. The pictures generated two main thoughts: “I miss ’90s cartoons” and “OMG, that totally looks like you!”
In America, an estimated 6 million children are abused every year, according to Child Help, a non-profit organization concerned with child abuse.
It took me less than a minute to find that statistic. Advocacy does not have to be downright depressing, but it’s empty if it doesn’t make anyone want to solve problems.
Some problems are addressed tactfully, however. Thus far, I’ve seen nothing but tasteful commentary on capital punishment — I’ve seen pictures of Davis with informative links below, and I’ve seen referrals to Amnesty International’s coverage of the issue.
The Davis case is getting the kind of attention it deserves. Cancer patients and child abuse survivors deserve equally respectful treatment.

When the Los Angeles Raiders moved to Oakland in 1995, the majority of this year’s freshman class at USC had yet to reach the age of three. Now, after a 16-year absence, NFL football finally appears close to returning to the City of Angels.
Julia Vann | Daily Trojan
On Aug. 9, L.A. City Council voted 12-0 in favor of building a state-of-the-art football stadium next to the Staples Center. A month later, the California State Senate passed SB292, a bill designed to fend off any legal challenges the construction might face. That stadium, tentatively named Farmers Field, is set to open in 2016.
The stadium will lead to numerous benefits resonating throughout the city of Los Angeles, from creating jobs to finally giving Los Angeles residents the football team they have been clamoring for.
The benefits of potentially having an NFL team based in Los Angeles are innumerable. To start off, by locating the stadium at L.A. Live, students will be able to interact with Los Angeles in a unique way.
Moreover, USC has previously been dubbed Los Angeles’ pro team, but with recent sanctions against the Trojans and a downturn in success, this is no longer the case. With that said, having an NFL team in the city will give fans what they need. The economic benefits of having an Los Angeles-based team could potentially change the stagnant nature of California’s economy.
Regardless of which team ends up in Los Angeles, that professional football is nearly certain to return to one of the largest markets in the country is great news for the NFL and for pigskin-crazed Angelenos.
Contrary to what some might believe, Al Davis didn’t send the Raiders packing in 1995 because football in Los Angeles was lacking fan support — the decision had more to do with tougher television restrictions and issues with the Coliseum. Davis didn’t receive the renovations he was looking for, and with a 90,000-plus capacity, the Coliseum’s size led to some understandably empty seats.
The NFL didn’t make any exceptions for larger stadiums, though, meaning TV blackouts could occur whenever a game didn’t sell out. No NFL stadium currently seats more than 82,000, as other teams are careful to make sure their games will be broadcast across the nation. But make no mistake, a new football team in Los Angeles will bring fans out in droves because of their desire to watch pro football in Los Angeles again.
Despite the problems the Raiders faced in the ’90s, starting as soon as next season there could  very well be games on Saturdays and Sundays at the Coliseum.
USC appears close to acquiring the master lease on the stadium it has long called home, meaning the university could start making the repairs necessary for NFL games to take place. For USC students, that’s certainly an exciting prospect. And, if completed, Farmers Field promises to be one of the best stadiums around.
To avoid the seating capacity problems the Raiders faced, Farmers Field will fit a more realistic 68,000. Investors aren’t cutting any corners though — the project will cost upward of $1 billion. According to the official Farmers Field website, 30,000 jobs will be created as a result of its construction.
As for who might end up playing in the new stadium, look for the San Diego Chargers to emerge as the top candidate.
The Chargers have played in San Diego since 1961. They haven’t had a losing record since 2004, but in recent years, fan support appears to have taken a hit. Last season, the Chargers ranked 23rd out of 32 teams in attendance figures, and had multiple games blacked out, meaning the NFL wouldn’t broadcast their games on TV because the team couldn’t sell out Qualcomm Stadium.
They can get out of their lease as soon as 2012, and as ESPN reporter Arash Markazi recently pointed out, owner Alex Spanos is 88 years old and interested in selling a minority stake in the team. AEG, the group responsible for financing the construction of Farmers Field, wants to buy a minority stake in whoever comes to Los Angeles. It almost makes too much sense for the Chargers to make the move.
No matter which way you look at it, the future is bright for football in a city starving for another chance to cheer on an NFL franchise. And if you’re a betting sports fan, look for that NFL franchise to come from 120 miles down the road in San Diego.

Who said anything about sweetheart deals? Allowing an nfl stadium to be built by a private corporation is a sweetheart deal??? 
The LA Coliseum is almost 100 years old. Yes it has a lot of history, and I hope it never gets torn down. But, come on. You can’t ask an nfl team to play in a relic. And I hope it never gets renovated. Its a part of city history, don’t tear it all up and remodel it because “its too old but we’re too cheap to build a new one.”
You fondly remember the forum and regret its closing for sports use? You must be the only one. I mean great things happened there like the miracle on manchester but it was a piece of crap. Every time I have been to the staples center, it impresses me.
El Torito???? Tustin???? Who the hell would drive all the way out there? And did you maybe forget there are southland fans in thousand oaks, ventura, santa barbara, SLO? Los angeles is the hub. Southern California is the wheel. LA is accessible to all.
You “commute daily past downtown.” So you drive through it during weekday rush hour. Yes, it is congested then. At all other times the traffic is never a problem. And I don’t know if you knew this, but NFL games are on SUNDAY. There is hardly any traffic throughout L.A. on a Sunday, even at 9am/5pm.
The NFL wants Los Angeles (not Cowtown, Southern CA) for tv money, and Los Angeles wants the NFL for jobs and entertainment.
I think Gov. Brown’s fast-tracking (if not outright bypassing) the environmental regulations *is* a sweetheart deal.
And for the record, the nose-bleed seats in the Staples Center has cr4ppy acoustics. The Stones sounded like someone in the apartment above was having a really great party.
As far as making the stadium more centrally located in a less dense part of So Cal, it is win-win all around as far as I can see.
You think the whole region is centered on downtown LA? Are the NY Giants not the Giants because they play out of Jersey (or is that the Jets?)?
Each time a state of the art venue is built, it eventually becomes dated. Teams use their willingness to bail on a particular city as leverage for future sweetheart deals.
But I really don’t have much say on the matter as I just live and work here.
I commute daily past the proposed Staples site. The congestion and density is already too heavy. In addition to the LA Convention Center and the Staples Arena, in and near the complex are theaters, concert clubs, highrise hotel with heliport. And now they want to drop a football stadium in the middle of it? Get real. The area has already suffered from endless construction. The LA City Council seems like the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. They chased the Rams out of the Coliseum, kept USC from rennovating the adjacent sports arena for college basketball which would have made the Coliseum location all SC sports, or working a deal with the Lakers (the Fabulous Forum in Inglewood is a mega church/white elephant now) , and now want giant giveaways to make this particular corridor ground zero for gridlock. Saddest thing is that the Coliseum is a very short trip down the street (but it’s next to a neighborhood that is not “upscale”). It has soooo much history, 1st Super Bowl, 2 Summer Olympics (only a few cities share that honor), and I’ve seen the rennovation plans for it in the LA Times that were really cool.
An earlier design for a plan at the curve of the 405 fwy (Torrance?) was ugly as hell (looked like a giant Taco Bell – really!)
City of Irwindale was an old Al Davis site (he got 12 mil from the city for nuttin) and that’s not bad, but if the team doesn’t come to LA proper, I think the City of Industry or the old El Toro airbase in Tustin are both better locations because they’re more central to a broader range of southland fans.
And that’s from someone who couldn’t care less about professional spectator sports. I now root against the Lakers so I never have to deal with their workday championship party traffic nightmares, which gives local pols even more of our money to goof off with. I liked the Rams as a kid but I can like them if I want to wherever they play.
And NO sweetheart deals!!The NFL needs LA/So Cal more than LA/So Cal needs the NFL. Freakin’ luxury box lovin’ elitist robber barons. The rich corporate crybabies can’t enjoy live sports unless you build a fancy suite on top of the stadium to keep from being contaminated by the hoi polloi and riff raff (who will end up footing the bill anyway).
@flirlyburly What does Ed Roski’s status with USC have to do with what’s best for the city of LA?! This article isn’t titled “Let’s make USC’s donors richer to the detriment of Los Angeles” I mean, come on. At this point it should be obvious that Roski’s plan is practically a joke and has no chance of happening, despite all the unexplainable press it gets. Plans like Roski’s are the reason LA still doesn’t have an NFL team. Anschutz and Leiweke are the power hitters around here; see: STAPLES Center
Alex,
I love this article. Good research and great points. Pay no attention to the posters who are a bunch of chicken littles, trying to see a conspiracy in a legitimate effort to help them! LA needs Farmers Field. Our unemployment is over 12%. This would be great for the city of LA that USC is a part of. The poster who tried to attack you as a freshman, who clearly goes to USC, is one of those selfish students who makes the point “It’ll cause traffic for us USC students, no stadium!” That attitude is ridiculous.
One quibble with the article. USC is LA’s most followed football team at the moment. But they are NOT a pro team as you printed in this article. The players are not paid , hence it is a volunteer, unpaid, amateur team, not a pro team. College football fans in LA love USC. But there are far more people here that are big NFL fans, not college fans. Just because an nfl team comes here doesn’t mean that USC’s popularity will drop. I appreciate that you realize that. I hope you continue to write on this subject. Feel free to email me at llhnickerson*dontspamme*@yahoo.com I am a very good copy editor and I can clean up whatever you want to publish.
AEG’s downtown location would be bad for USC.  It would make it less likely that the Coliseum would be renovated.  It would tie up traffic near USC on the weekends, creating traffic gridlock from hell.  Also consider that Ed Roski, who wants to build the competing stadium in Grand Crossing, is a major USC donor/leader.  Alex I wonder if you are a real USC Trojan.  Oh, you are a Freshman, that explains it!!
LA isn’t paying for a stadium or a team.  LA is paying for a new addition to the convention center, and issuing bonds to pay for a stadium, which bonds will be backed by private money — i.e., no downside for the city.
And it’s not just a football stadium; it’s an events center.  At least that’s what AEG is promising…
You simply need to follow the old cheesy crime drama statement: “follow the money.”.  I will guarantee that the taxpayers are on the hook either with providing some sort of collateral to back the bonds or the developers are being given “sweet-heart” tax incentives (which puts the burden on the tax-payers).  Hey, how about giving “sweet-heart” tax incentives for a “research park/R&D center”?  The bottom line is that PRO teams DO NOT PROVIDE ANY LONG TERM FINANCIAL GAIN for the cities that have them.  What the developers/team owners hide from you is the the increased crime rates (great crime magnet since law enforcement are only out in force during the 6 hours a week the stadium is used during the football season and then disappear after that, while their normal patrol areas they are supposed to be covering are uncovered); the increased pollution (you really don’t think the sports fans are going to ride the rail down town do you?); the decreased housing (you don’t really think the people in that neighbourhood can afford a $60.00 seat every other weekend do you?) Or in the situation I am familiar with in my own town:  The removal of parking meters where you paid $1.00/hr for parking on the street. Once the team got to town, they were removed and a no-parking zones replaced them. You are now forced to pay $10.00/hr in parking structures owned by…. You guessed it … The TEAM OWNER OR HIS CORPORATION. The cars parked on the streets and the downtown merchants are gone now. So it is pretty much a waste area and a fire magnet for all of those empty insured buildings now.
Finally, you need to ask yourself the following:  If I graduate from ‘SC with a degree, will I be able to get a job at the stadium?  The answer is “yes” if your willing to work minimum wage (ala UCLA grad) or your a multi-millionaire football player.
How many ‘SC graduates could have worked at a “Research/R&D center” if it were built instead?  I would hazard quite a few more and they could have a earned a wage would have allowed them to live in LA.
This is just simple foolishness.  It has already been PROVEN that pro-ball teams DO NOT RETURN AS MUCH AS THEY TAKE from the local economy.  I currently live in a city where a pro-ball team was lured to it when the city promised to build them a new stadium.  They came and the stadium was built.  THAT TEAM LEFT 10 years later AND THE STADIUM IS STILL BEING PAID FOR BY THE TAX-PAYERS at the rate of $30,000/month on the bonds floated to pay for the construction. People don’t realise the cities make promises in TAX-CUTS/TAX-DEDUCTIONS/PROPERTY TAX CUTS in the 100’s of millions of TAX PAYER DOLLARS to bring these teams in.  The teams in turn hire 100-200  HOURLY employees that work 5-8 hours a week just above minimum wage.  WHERE ARE THE JOBS??? L.A. City and California (which is insolvent/bankrupt) are footing the bill by not taxing the stadium or the team and then underwriting hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts (probably even floating bonds with the rich bonds-brokers/bankers).  WHEN WILL PEOPLE GET IT THAT THE TAXPAYERS CAN NO LONGER SUPPORT THIS WASTE???  The coliseum in an anomaly, there are no pro stadiums in this country that are more than 25 years old.  Just look at how many stadiums that St. Louis has built over the last 30 years in order to keep the cardinals in the city (oops…  don’t count the phoenix cardinals).  The football owners are RICH because they know how to fleece the local governments and the tax-payers.  People need to start voting with their pocketbooks and NOT WITH THE MISTAKEN BELIEF THAT PRO SPORTS WILL CREATE THE NEXT TAX BOOM for the tax payers.  It doesn’t happen except in fairy-tales and big bankers dreams.
I heard the details you’ve provided confirmed from other sources as well. The economic benefit is neither as far-ranging or as substantial as it is presented by the promoters.
There are give-aways on parking concessions, tax-breaks in various guises, the waving of environmental impact studies and regulations, and so on.
I like the fact that LA can be a “world class city” with or without a pro football team. Not only that, if the desire is to provide live NFL action for the fans (and not just pamper corporate luxury box owners), then let Los Angeles be the anchor for an “America’s Team” franchise.
The NFL can create an expansion team (or league even) and field teams that rotate the venues that they play in, but only existing stadiums and facilities. Any number of cities would welcome an opportunity to make use of these neglected sites. I’d love to be linked with Cleveland who lost the Browns to Baltimore (and now are the Ravens) or any number of cities (2 or more – some clubs might play each game in a different city for each game on the schedule). It can be any city with a field and a desire to link up and share the wealth of a pro-ball club.
It would be like a “team timeshare”. Offer travel discounts for fans wanting to follow the club. Have inter-city competitions on favorite venues and award the winner priority for playoffs and big game scheduling match-ups. Only draft players from states that are linked in this manner – excluding those who already have one or more NFL teams in their state.
Letting some mega-rich owner dictate terms to the city is embarassing. And city after city gets jilted or dumped by wandering franchises.
Making better use of what we have seems a lot smarter than going through the same dog and pony show time and again.
And I like the idea of working with other municipalities rather than stealing someone elses franchise. How is San Diego supposed to feel if we make off with the Chargers? What will they do with their stadium? 
Create more wealth, not reallocate it.
Currently, the NFL is about as stale as the new team names that get picked.
Done the right way, LA could use its creativity to really bring some new excitement to the league, not just try to recapture what they lost in the first place.

On Sept. 26, DreamWorks Animation, which has produced animated classics such as the Madagascar and Shrek series, signed a deal with Netflix to promote its films and television specials. It is the first time a major Hollywood supplier has chosen Web streaming over pay television.

According to some analyst estimates, the contract could earn the production house an estimated $30 million per movie. Under the deal, Netflix will begin distributing DreamsWorks’ titles in 2013 for an unspecified number of years. It replaces HBO’s similar deal with DreamWorks.

This new deal offers a small ray of hope for the content streaming company, which has suffered from a declining subscriber base and a resultant drop in stock prices in the recent past. Apple, Amazon and Vudu, Wal-Mart’s streaming service, have also been offering strong competition to the embattled company.

In fact the very day after Netflix announced its deal, Amazon also announced a licensing agreement with Fox. The contract allows Amazon Prime members to instantly stream a broad selection of popular movies and TV shows from the Fox library. These include Fox biggies such as The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, 24, Arrested Development and The Wonder Years.
Another of Netflix’s key competitor, Dish Network, which plucked Blockbuster out of bankruptcy earlier in 2011, had launched a Blockbuster-branded streaming and DVD-by-mail service Sept. 23 to further tighten competition.

While it remains unlikely that Netflix can reclaim the dizzying heights of a $300 stock price, this new deal could provide some much needed relief to the content streaming company and lead to a revival in its fortunes.

In a protest against a bill that would allow affirmative action in California, Republicans from University of California, Berkeley hosted a “Diversity Bake Sale” on Tuesday that priced cupcakes and cookies based on the race of the purchaser.
Sparking controversy and several opposing protests from groups on campus, the baked goods were sold for $2 to white students, $1.50 to Asian Americans, $1.00 to Latinos and down to 25 cents for Native American students — women were given an automatic 25-cent discount.
Though the group did not enforce the pricing policies, many at Berkeley expressed anger at what they perceived was a “racist” attempt at satire.
UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert Birgeneau said in a message Monday that he opposed the use of race in the bake sale, but encouraged discussion on affirmative action on campus.
“[It is] a vivid lesson that issues of race, ethnicity and gender are far from resolved,” Birgeneau wrote.
In a counterprotest, hundreds of Berkeley students dressed in black laid down on Sproul Plaza — the heart of the campus —for about an hour on Tuesday. Many held signs saying, “UC us now?”
Former UC Regent Ward Connerly, however, was at the bake sale to support the Republican protest against affirmative action — a position he is well known for.
“The point is, the people of California have said we don’t want to see race and color in admissions,” Connerly told the San Francisco Chronicle.
The bill currently at Gov. Jerry Brown’s desk would overturn a 1996 ban on affirmative action that prohibited the use of race, ethnicity and gender in college admissions and public hiring and contracting.
