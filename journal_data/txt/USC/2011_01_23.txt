SC Outfitters guides, students and members of the USC Wrigley Institute for Environmental Studies took part in a weekend-long Wilderness First Aid training program at the Wrigley Institute on Catalina Island this weekend.

The program was designed to teach students valuable first aid skills that they could use in the wild or during outdoor activities. Students got the opportunity to participate in simulated medical situations.
“It’s very hands-on, which is awesome, because when we have the patients, we have no idea what’s going on with them,” said Christine Sur, a junior majoring in environmental studies.
Participants took a boat from Long Beach to Catalina, where they settled into the dorms and took a number of informative classes before heading outside for hands-on experience.
“The WFA is a largely scenario-based course, so a lot of it is done outside in groups and it’s really exciting,” said SC Outfitters President Jay Creech.
This was the first year USC has done a WFA program. SC Outfitters tried to host the program before, but it proved to be a challenging process.
“We started thinking about this pretty long ago, in the fall of 2009,” Creech said. “We picked it up again in August. We had to figure out when the dorms would be available and which weekend would work best for the guides.”
Students learned how to deal with everything from fractures, sprains and dislocations, to treating people suffering from dehydration, hypothermia and heat stroke.
Some of the simulated scenarios included treating a fractured wrist and moving someone whose spine couldn’t stand being shifted.
The participants also learned the value of gathering data in order to make good decisions for patients.
“It helps you become a better guide,” Sur said. “I wanted to get some kind of formal training because, as a guide, it’s important to be prepared.”
The medical aspect, however, is not the only lure of the WFA.
“This program is great for any USC student who has any interest in activities like hiking and backpacking,” said senior David Price, a public policy, management and planning major, who is getting his First Aid re-certification.
Many believe that the program is a good addition for USC.
“I think it gives us a lot of legitimacy,” Creech said. “We’re giving students the ability to get out of the city and it’s an especially great course for pre-med students.”

College students could receive up to $10,000 in tax credits over the course of their education as part of an extension of the American Opportunity Tax Credit.
Renee Cohn | Daily Trojan 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan unveiled the revised AOTC on Thursday to students and parents at Woodrow Wilson Senior High School in Washington, D.C.
The goal of the AOTC is to make college financially attainable for all Americans and to alleviate the rising costs of a college education.
Individuals making less than $80,000 a year and married couples making less than $160,000 a year will qualify for the AOTC, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Approximately 9.4 million students with college students are expected to qualify for the AOTC this year, according to a Treasury Department analysis.
The AOTC, which was initially passed under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is an expansion of the Hope Credit.
Unlike the Hope Credit, which only covered the first two years of a college student’s education, the AOTC covers four years of post-secondary education with a maximum tax credit of $2,500 per year. The AOTC also provides an allowance for textbooks.
The AOTC is expected to cover 80 percent of tuition and fees at a two-year public college or 30 percent of tuition and fees at a four-year public college, according to a Treasury analysis.
Thomas McWhorter, executive director of financial aid at USC, sees the AOTC as positive news for both current and prospective students and their families.
“I certainly think that [the AOTC] will help families,” McWhorter said. “We can exclude an additional $2,500 from [a family’s] income when assessing them for financial aid.”
The average family is expected to receive a tax credit of $1,900.
Grace Paek, a freshman majoring in health and humanities, said she is excited about the AOTC, but worries that a $2,500 tax credit will not significantly benefit a family with a college student.
“I’m glad [Obama] is looking at rising tuition costs, but I don’t know if $2,500 will do that much,” Paek said. “College tuition is rising so quickly.”
Samantha Gurash, a freshman majoring in writing for screen and television, questions how the AOTC will be funded.
“In theory I agree with the [AOTC],” Gurash said. “But I want to know where the money is coming from because there are so many other things that need to be paid off right now.”
In a joint blog post, Geithner and Duncan discussed the correlation between a well-educated population and America’s global economic success.
“The nations that best educate their children today will be the nations that lead the global economy in the 21st century,” they wrote. “In order to have the best-educated workforce, we must help put college education within reach for all students and their families.”
The AOTC is expected to award $18.2 billion in tax credits to students and parents, according to Duncan and Geithner.
Geithner and Duncan also announced the simplification of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid and an increase in Pell grant funding to lessen the financial burden of college tuition.
[…] a tax credit of $10,000 over four years given to parents paying their kids college tuition. The credit was in effect in 2009 and 2010 as part of the Recovery Act, and was extended for 2011 and 2012 as […]

The west side — in the area bounded by Vermont and Normandie avenues, student presence has grown significantly in recent years, but the university’s presence has not grown to match.
Safety first · Twelve security ambassadors will be stationed west of Vermont to heighten security in an area that was not previously patrolled. - Betsy Newman | Daily Trojan 
Though Campus Cruiser operates in the neighborhoods west of campus and the Dept. of Public Safety patrols the streets, “yellow jacket” security ambassadors or cameras that provide an extra set of eyes in other areas near USC are noticeably absent.
That’s all about to change.
President C. L. Max Nikias told the Daily Trojan last week that in the coming months the university will triple its off-campus security efforts, bringing security ambassadors and cameras to the west side for the first time.
“This is a major, major improvement,” Nikias said. “It’s been the university policy that we don’t want to go west of Vermont, but if our students are going over there — and I feel we can’t convince them not to — I felt it was very important to increase security.”
Forty-five regular cameras will be added to the 27 already in place, and the number of locations with cameras that can capture images of vehicle license plates will jump from five to 19. Fifteen of the regular cameras and 12 of the license plate cameras will be installed in the neighborhood west of USC. All 12 of the new security ambassadors will be stationed west of campus.
The university has not yet finalized a bid on the project, so final costs have not been determined, but Nikias estimated the price tag will be $3 million per year. He anticipates that the components will be in place by the start of the upcoming school year.
The initiative is a product of several years of conversations with students, faculty and staff, explained Charlie Lane, associate senior vice president for Career and Protective Services, but Nikias was the catalyst for effecting change.
“He challenged us to see what we could do and come up with more technology to reduce crime even further,” Lane said. “That was the genesis.”
Nikias was concerned about safety in part because students were concerned. 
When students move off campus, most congregate north of campus, in the area between Jefferson and Adams. Many students avoid the west side, where lighting is sparse and rumors of crime are prevalent.
But rumors, DPS Chief Carey Drayton said, are often just that.
Though crime does occur on the west side, the numbers are not as high as students might think. According to daily DPS reports, no crime has been reported taking place west of campus this month.
Drayton said it’s all about perception.
“That perception is led by the fact that we have no university housing over there, so we don’t have the benefit of that university white light that we tend to put on the sides of our buildings that homeowners and renters don’t put on the side of theirs. We have the security ambassadors in other areas of the campus that we don’t have over there. We have a tram route everywhere else; we don’t have a tram route over there,” Drayton said. “So there are things that lend to that perception, but if you look at the numbers, those numbers don’t bare out that it’s so much more unsafe over there.”
Drayton noted, however, that for some, the numbers don’t matter.
“It doesn’t matter how many times I prove to you using numbers that it’s no more or less unsafe, if there’s one incident that you can point to, then it’s unsafe to you,” Drayton said.
For Amin El Gamal, a graduate student studying acting, that one incident occurred a year ago. He was walking back to his apartment on 37th Street when three teenagers approached him and asked for money. One of the teenagers brandished a knife, another a gun, and El Gamal’s cell phone was taken.
“In the scheme of muggings, it probably wasn’t that bad because I didn’t really give them anything of value except my phone which wasn’t worth anything,” he said. “But just that kind of assault — I was completely on edge. I felt really afraid.”
Despite being robbed, El Gamal said he enjoys living on 36th Street, where he lives now.
“The residents on the whole are really good people and it’s more quiet, and it’s a little bit more funky and has character,” El Gamal said.
Rick Jones, who has lived on Budlong Avenue for 10 years, said he also enjoys living in an area with both students and other residents, and said he would welcome USC’s additional security.
“I don’t have a problem with it,” he said. “It’s better for me, because I’ve got my kids, my family, my cars, my business.”
Lane and Drayton said the non-USC community has been brought into the conversation as the university plans this project. Overall, they said the feedback has been positive.
University officials have high hopes for the new security measures. Cameras have been successful crime deterrents at USC.  In one instance, Drayton said, the number of robberies dropped from 22 to two after five cameras were installed in a location north of USC.
The security ambassadors provide students a sense of security and officials hope the combination of these strategies will continue to bring down the rate of crime not just west of campus, but all around USC.
“It certainly focuses on the west side of campus, but this is an all-campus initiative,” Lane said.
What do you think about the increased security efforts being put in place west of campus?
Total Voters: 274
I believe that it will only include just directly west of campus not northwest.  I believe it’s already within what DPS patrol and where Campus Cruiser will go since otherwise DPS would have to change their Memorandum of Understanding with LAPD.
I am also wondering whether the west include northwest…
I hope this expansion includes the area immediately northwest of campus. I just moved into a house on 30th street, on the corner of Catalina, only about 5 minutes walk from campus. But I discovered that USC security and campus cruiser only extends west in the area south of Jefferson. Looking at the map, everything northwest of Jefferson and Vermont is ignored…

The USC women’s basketball team ended a disappointing trip to the Bay Area with a 95-51 loss to No. 4 Stanford on Saturday.
Needing an almost-flawless performance to take down the high-powered Cardinal, USC (12-6, 4-3) couldn’t keep pace with the defending Pac-10 champions.
Making history · Junior guard Briana Gilbreath became just the 22nd women’s player to reach 1,000 points in her career for the Women of Troy. - Kelvin Kuo | Daily Trojan 
The Women of Troy shot just 28 percent from the field while allowing Stanford to shoot over 50 percent.
The performance convinced at least one observer of the Cardinal’s championship potential.
“Last time I had my butt kicked this bad was in Boston Garden and that was as a player,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “That was a long time ago. This team’s probably going to win it all. I will put my namesake on that one.”
With the loss, USC dropped to 5-6 on the road this season.
The Women of Troy are undefeated, however, in seven games inside the friendly confines of the Galen Center.
Trailing 8-7, Stanford (16-2, 7-0) quickly erased any hope of a USC upset by going on a 17-2 run.
The Cardinal shot 48 percent in the first half and controlled the backboards, outrebounding USC 27-16 and holding a 12-2 edge in second-chance points.
“They make you pay for your mistakes,” junior guard Briana Gilbreath said. “We gave them a lot of open shots tonight and they knocked them down like we [expected].”
Freshman forward Chiney Ogwumike, the nation’s No. 1 recruit, validated her lofty ranking with 14 points and nine rebounds in the first half. Senior guard Jeanette Pohlen added nine points and nine assists to help give Stanford a 46-27 lead at the break.
Gilbreath led USC with nine points in the first half. Senior center Kari LaPlante added six points on 3-for-3 shooting for the Women of Troy,
A slow start out of halftime ended any chance of a USC rally.
The Women of Troy missed eight of their first nine shots in the second half and trailed by at least 30 points for most of the half.
“In the first half we fought pretty hard,” Gilbreath said. “We didn’t come out with the greatest intensity in the second half.”
One of the few positives for USC was Gilbreath knocking down two free throws to become the 22nd player in school history to register 1,000 points in her career.
After the game, the junior guard expressed mixed emotions about the record.
“It’s kind of bittersweet because I didn’t get it with a victory,” she said. “But I’ve put in a lot of hard work over the years so to see it pay off makes me happy.”
Gilbreath finished with a team-high 17 points on her record-setting night.
Pohlen led the Cardinal with 21 points and 12 assists.
Junior guard Ashley Corral is also within striking distance of 1,000 points for her career, but finished with just nine points Saturday while continuing to struggle with her shot. Corral did add six rebounds and four assists.
Next up for the Women of Troy is a homestand against Arizona and Arizona State, two teams tied with USC at 4-3 in Pac-10 play.
Tough break for the Women of Troy. But the elegant prose and professional style of this newspaper article almost fills the void.

Former USC tailback Stafon Johnson will file a lawsuit against USC 16 months after suffering a severe throat injury during a weightlifting accident, according to Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times.
Johnson’s attorney has called a press conference for Monday to announce the filing of a personal injury lawsuit against the school.
Carl Douglas told Klein that the lawsuit will seek unspecified damages from USC, as well as Jamie Yanchar, a former assistant strength and conditioning coach at USC who was present at the time of Johnson’s accident.
Yanchar now works in a similar capacity for the Seattle Seahawks.
In September of 2009, Johnson dropped a barrel on himself while bench pressing in USC’s weight room, causing serious injuries to his throat, and leading him to be hospitalized for approximately three weeks. He missed the remainder of the season.
The Los Angeles native was signed as a free agent by the Tennessee Titans following last April’s NFL Draft, but an ankle injury sustained in a preseason game ended his rookie season. He was relegated to the practice squad as a result.
Both Johnson and the university have yet to comment about the lawsuit.
I doubt this is Johnson himself wanting revenge or money from USC for what happened. Most likely his insurance company is forcing the lawsuit to recoup medical expenses. He probably hates that its happening, and is forced not to talk about it by lawyers.
Huh???  Insurance companies are fully able and willing to sue on their own behalf.  You are giving Stafon too much credit.
Interesting that he only felt like suing after he got relegated to the Titans practice squad. Sounds like he needs to sue whoever caused his ankle injury LOL.
I highly doubt that the kid is actually dumb enough not to know how to lift a 275-lb weight. Especially in a manner that would crush his larynx. It is far more likely that he was pushed to do something he wasn’t comfortable with by coaches that always demand more for their ‘no. 1.’ team. Sadly, this doesn’t change much – We won’t ever be able to know the truth, the contracts the kid signed will push all the liability on him, USC will do its USC thing and not address it, we students will continue to assume that if the school is silent, it must be innocent and the other party (be it Johnson or the NCAA) is at fault.
Ever hear of accidents?  Stafon and his attorney will have an uphill battle proving USC was negligent, but not for any conspiracy theory that you are suggesting.
Assumed risk should enter here. How is it anyone elses fault that you dropped a bar on your throat? I love Stephan, but he has been trained how to lift safely in the weight room. I dont understand this suit.

Aiming to remain in the win column and on track toward another NCAA title come season’s end, the No. 2 USC men’s tennis team wrapped up its weekend slate with decisive doubleheader wins.
The Trojans (2-0) went head-to-head with the Sacramento State Hornets and St. Mary’s College Gaels at Marks Stadium, finishing 6-1 and 7-0, respectively.
USC pocketed a sweep against the Gaels with freshmen Ray Sarmiento and Michael Grant pairing up as a dominant doubles team, beating SMC 8-2.
“Ray played really good and he stood out,” said USC coach Peter Smith. “Jaak played well also, but the whole team was there and competed really well.”
Sarmiento finished with a 6-1, 6-3 victory against the Gaels’ Maxime Olivan.
USC swept singles and doubles against the Gaels, though senior Peter Lucassen and sophomore Joel Giger would play into three sets to clinch their single’s wins.
Against Sacramento State, the Trojans swept doubles, with senior Jaak Poldma standing out at the No. 2 spot.
All singles matches were won in straight-sets, with the Hornets collecting their only win of the day in singles, when Lucassen fell 6-4, 6-4 to Aliaksandr Malko.
This was also the first match for newly eligible freshman Emilio Gomez, who saw his first on-court action in doubles with junior Daniel Nguyen at No. 1.
“We just got Emilio eligible, so we need to make him feel more comfortable in doubles and singles,“  Smith said.
Gomez snagged his first singles win against Sacramento State.
“It was a great start for the season,” Smith said. “It wasn’t perfect, but there were some good moments.”
Smith saw the day as an opportunity for growth and improvement.
“There’s a lot we can get out of that to help make us a better team,” he said. “I want to play teams that will come and challenge us and not lay down to us.”
Next up for the Trojans is hosting the ITA Kick-Off Weekend on Friday and Saturday.

The No. 1 USC men’s volleyball team continued its first road swing of the season Friday at No. 15 UC San Diego.
The Trojans were dominant, disposing of the Tritons in straight sets (25-12, 25-23, 25-17) at RIMAC Arena.
Helping hand · Senior middle blocker Austin Zahn finished with six kills in helping the Trojans defeat UC San Diego at RIMAC Arena. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“This win is really important for us,” said junior outside hitter Tony Ciarelli. “Coming off three pretty emotional matches against Cal State Northridge, Long Beach State and UC Irvine, it was great to focus and take care of business and get this win in three.”
Senior opposite hitter Murphy Troy led the way with 15 kills earned at a very efficient .522 clip to go along with five digs.
Ciarelli finished with 11 kills.
“Overall it was a great match,” Troy said. “Riley [McKibbin] did a great job spreading the ball around. That made our job a lot easier.”
Senior outside hitter Tri Bourne got his first start of the season after a solid match Wednesday.
“He passed pretty well, served well and blocked well,” said USC coach Bill Ferguson. “And when we needed kills from him, we got them.”
The Trojans (4-0, 4-0) continued to utilize their efficient middle attack throughout the game.
Senior middle blocker Austin Zahn had five kills at a .714 clip and junior middle blocker Steven Shandrick had five kills at a .625 clip.
“We didn’t set the middles as much as we would like,” Ferguson said. “But they hit efficiently and helped create a lot of one-on-ones at the pins.”
This balanced efficiency has been a trend all season long as USC has so far hit at or above a .400 clip.
In total, USC outhit UCSD .416 to .184.
On the other side, outside hitter Carl Eberts led UCSD with nine kills.
The Tritons’ (2-4, 1-2) gameplan had to be adjusted during the match, as setter Phil Bannan played the roles of both setter and hitter in an effort to give the senior more scoring opportunities.
“We did a good job of getting him off the service line, where he scores a lot of his points,” Ferguson said.
Ferguson’s premium on good passing and defense was also displayed Friday, with senior setter Riley McKibbin and freshman libero Henry Cassiday each finishing with seven digs.
The Trojans also sided out at a 94 percent rate in the third set to close the match.
“The final set of every match has had the highest side-out percentage,” Ferguson said. “We’re doing a great job closing.”
The Trojans play again at No. 5 UC Santa Barbara on Wednesday at 7 p.m.
The Gauchos are 4-3 overall.

NCAA bylaws require that a successful appeal of sanctions proves an “abuse of discretion.” But fans understand that doing so is challenging. The odds are bleak. College athletics’ governing body must acknowledge its previously rendered decision was incorrect. In essence, it must admit failure.
Since the NCAA amended its procedure for appeals hearings in 2008, just one in 11 cases has been successful. USC athletic director Pat Haden, as a result, has exercised caution when asked about the Trojans’ chances of softening penalties handed down on the football program last June, which infamously include a two-year bowl ban and a loss of 30 scholarships over three years.
“I’m just realistic,” Haden told reporters earlier this month. “I’m just going with the odds — 10 percent of appeals are successful.”
Haden, along with other school officials, such as President C. L. Max Nikias, met with the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee on Saturday in Indianapolis to present USC’s case that the same organization had erred in its initial ruling last summer.
“All I will say is that I want to thank the NCAA for giving us an opportunity before the appeals committee to have a good and fair hearing,” Nikias said after the meeting at an Indianapolis hotel. “Now we have to wait for the ruling.”
In spite of Nikias’ remarks, however, it’s important to note that when it comes to USC and the NCAA, things have never been “fair.” In many respects, since the inception of sanctionsgate about a year ago, the Trojans have been dealt a rather unfavorable hand.
When the university initially met with the 10-member Committee on Infractions in February 2010, the staff’s inclusion of certain members jeopardized the integrity of the investigation. Heading the committee was chairperson Paul Dee, the former athletic director at the University of Miami.
Under Dee’s watch, the Hurricanes’ athletic program was cited by the NCAA for a “significant lack of institutional control” in 1995 and further sanctioned after a myriad of gun, drug and sexual abuse scandals plagued its football team.
Fifteen years later, Dee applied the same term to the USC football program in dolling out the harshest penalties since the 1987 SMU death penalty, a title that had previously been reserved for Dee’s Canes. Since then many have speculated that the former athletic director was influenced by a desire to have another modern-day football titan carry a distinction that had once been reserved for Miami: dirty.
Other members included Melissa L. Conboy, the deputy director of athletics at the University of Notre Dame, one of the Trojans’ fiercest rivals. For the better part of 22 years, Conboy has worked in the Irish athletic department, creating a possible conflict of interest.
But the decision to replace James O’Fallon, a University of Oregon law professor representing the Pac-10, on the committee with former COI member Josephine Pututo of the University of Nebraska, might have been the most irresponsible action taken. O’Fallon was forced to recuse himself because of Oregon’s conference affiliation with USC, and Dee opted to replace him with Pututo despite having already used up her limit of three three-year terms.
In spite of a puzzling collection of committee members, however, NCAA representatives insisted that the Trojans, who had been fighting allegations regarding improper benefits received by former tailback Reggie Bush since 2006, would be treated fairly and given due process.
During a 2004 hearing in front of Congress, Pututo explained that the NCAA’s enforcement, infractions and hearing procedures not only met due process standards, but in certain cases exceeded the 14th Amendment’s procedural protections. In short, USC was expected to be granted an opportunity to refute claims of a “lack of institution control,” suggesting that former coach Pete Carroll and his staff were fully aware of Bush receiving thousands of dollars in extra benefits.
But in the initial case USC was not afforded such an opportunity. The committee instead found that USC was guilty of a “lack of institutional control” on the basis that it “should have known” of Bush’s dealings with sports marketers Lloyd Lake and Michael Michaels.
“The real issue here is, if you have high-profile players, your enforcement staff has to monitor those students at a higher level,” Dee said in a June teleconference announcing the sanctions. “High-profile players merit high-profile enforcement.”
The rendered decision, however, varies from other, more recent rulings in which such similar logic seems to have been ignored, raising the question that if it’s applicable to USC, then why not other similar collegiate institutions?
When Auburn declared its Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Cam Newton ineligible in December amid allegations of Newton’s father seeking composition for his son to sign a letter of intent to play at Mississippi State, the NCAA appeared far more lenient.
In a span of 48 hours, it ruled Newton eligible, citing insufficient evidence to take action. By contrast, its investigation of USC and Bush took approximately four years — or 35,040 hours.
“Based on the information available to the reinstatement staff at this time, we do not have sufficient evidence that Cam Newton or anyone from Auburn was aware of this activity,” said Kevin Lennon, NCAA vice president for academic and membership affairs in a news release.
Despite far too little evidence in the Bush case, the committee punished USC while giving Newton and Auburn the benefit of the doubt.
Similarly, when five Ohio State football players were ruled ineligible in December for selling awards and exchanging autographs for tattoos, their five-game suspensions were postponed until the 2011 season since “the student-athletes were not aware they were committing violations.”
USC was punished for alleged ignorance in relation to Bush yet conversely the Tattoo Five’s penalties were softened due to ignorance.
This past weekend, Nikias cited fairness during his two-line description of USC’s appeal hearing, a largely optimistic outlook considering how events have transpired over the past 11 months.
We can only hope he’s right, because at this point in time we’re all still waiting for the NCAA to do anything “good and fair” in regard to USC.
“The 19th Hole” runs Mondays. To comment on this article email Joey at jrkaufma@usc.edu or visit dailytrojan.com.
Talking about fairness.  Is it fair for USC to steal a San Francisco college’s radio station?  Would it be fair if a college stole YOUR radio station?  All Trojans should be ashamed and embarrassed at what it’s college is doing to college radio in San Francisco.  Speak Up.  Tell the administration to halt this deal.
You all are such dumb@asses… go study.
Let me get this straight. The chairperson was the former AD at Miami where violations ran rampant for almost a decade – a man we can safely assume is desperate to repair his “reputation”.  Then the NCAA waive their own rules and bring out of mothballs someone from the accused school’s bitterest rival to help render “impartial” judgement – by the way a school that has been absolutely dominated by the accused for a decade +.  Certainly her school has nothing to gain by a decapitated rival.  This would be like putting someone, say from Goldman Sachs, in charge of the Treasury and then giving him carte blanche to make unilateral decisions affecting all of GS’ rivals.  Oh wait…How’d that turn out for GS and their biggest rival Lehman Bros?
This column is everything it should be:
1. Totally factual. Seriously, if you can find an error go ahead and let me know because everything here is spot on and clear.
2. A well-structured and nicely thought-out indictment of the NCAA’s treatment of USC. Seriously, anyone who isn’t a fan of Ohio St (and even some of them are with USC on this), Auburn, or that random public school in Westwood that seems to think it can talk after getting smashed by us in everything from academic rankings to men’s basketball (but that’s ok, they’re a football school anyways) will agree that an objective comparison of the USC case to the ones from this season isn’t anywhere close to fair, and that the wonderful due process that Ms Pututo testified to Congress that we’d be getting didn’t materialize.
3. NOT a hotheaded fanboy piece. USC clearly had student-athletes that violated NCAA rules and should be retroactively ruled ineligible. That’s just the truth and no one from the USC side is (or should be) disputing that. Having said that, USC operated under the assumption that it would receive due process, that it could question witnesses, face accusers, and on the whole, get “better than 14th Amendment protections.” Apparently the university should have known that two of it’s hundreds of athletes were violating rules and more importantly should have known that testimony delivered under oath to the US Congress by a member of the COI was not a credible source of information on how its case would be handled. This piece is saying that’s wrong, which it is, and nothing more.
4. A wonderful little fly-zapper that keeps drawing in pathetic USC-hating trolls to it’s light to get fried. If you want to come up with cute little acronyms for a rival school and some of those sick allusion-filled commenter names, that’s awesome and I wish you the best of times roaming around the internet, having a blast calling names and insulting people. But no one here wants to see people embarrass themselves by trying to desperately fling hatful words around. It’s sad to have to watch, and I would hope whatever university you do affiliate with would consider it unbecoming and embarrassing. You can compete on the field, you can only degrade yourself by trying to on a message board. 
Fight On! Great first column Joey!
Mazel mazel…
You tried to congratulate your boy on an article that you happen to agree with (because you both went to/go to SUC)…scrambling to paint the dirtiest program in NCAA history in a more flattering light is very admirable.
Read between the lines, ace.  It wasn’t what your male friend wrote, it’s what he DIDN’T write.  He conveniently skirted and skated around facts to suit his argument.  It’s called yellow journalism.
So let me get this straight:   You definition of “the dirtiest program in history” is a program that unwittingly allowed an athlete to play football after a wanna-be agent started negotiating with him to LEAVE USC and go pro.
Meanwhile the Chairman for the COI was the for AD of Miami where, among other things, boosters literally PAID athletes for dirty hits and TDs.   School officials were directly involved in a Pell Grant scam to have football players (and other athletes) steal money from the federal government.  And Paul Dee, himself, suspended a drug monitoring policy, thereby allowing ineligible athletes who had tested positive for drugs to play.   
Looking at Alabama alone, USC isn’t even the dirtiest program of the decade, let alone the history of the NCAA.   Either you are completely ignorant, are so blinded with envy that you are incapable of being intellectually honest, or you are a Paul Dee lackey trying to cover up for the corrupt man.  Regardless, you have displayed you have no credibility on the subject.
“scrambling to paint the dirtiest program in NCAA history in a more flattering light is very admirable.”
Go ahead and cite your source that shows that USC has a dirtier history than SMU, Auburn, Alabama, just to name a few.  Oh wait, you can’t because you just pulled this comment out of your @ss. And just in case you’re a UCLA fan, here’s two words for you: Sam Gilbert.  John Wooden and UCLA basketball was much, much dirtier than anything USC has even been accused of doing.     But thanks for the laugh.
I love it, more silly accronyms and now apparently I can’t congratulate someone because heaven forbid that a positive word be spoken on your internet. Oh and way to go on the “male friend” line. Love the specificity, ace. 
So just so that I can keep this wonderfully complex argument all clear… you’re accusing Joey of skirting and skating around facts to suit his argument. Ok, that’s actually a great point… assuming you have even one good example of a fact he skated around… which you don’t, ace. 
And then you call USC the “dirtiest program in NCAA history.” That’s a totally valid stance to take… assuming you have even one good piece of evidence USC committed more major violations than SMU, Miami, Alabama, or the University of San Francisco… which you don’t, ace.
Wait, so Joey can’t skirt facts in his column, but you can in your condemnation of it?
It’s called accusing someone of something, without proper evidence (USC fans, sound familiar?), while doing the exact same thing in that accusation.
This is too easy.
Auburn gets by with their infractions because they couldn’t be in the NC a few years ago – how ridiculous is that?
I’m seriously ashamed of going to USC whenever someone here says “ucl-gay”. Cmon dude that’s just ignorant.
Ann, we probably wouldn’t agree on Collegiate Sports in LA, but this is great!
What this “writer” (conveniently) neglects to mention is that $c was ALREADY on probation for previous violations when the Reggie Bush, OJ Payo, extra coach hiring (er, consulting), and those tennis player-related transgressions occured.  Cheating was rampant on Figueroa Tech’s campus throughout this time (see: one compliance officer).
Stick to your blog, Joey–your pathetic whining rings hollow, and you’re clearly not ready to write for an actual publication…even if it is the Daily trOJan.
Cheat on, $c!
It humors me that chumps from Un Challenging Liberal Arts aka “floodgate for jr. college transfers who pursue slacker majors” love to troll our blog. This issue doesn’t even involve ucl-gay, yet the envious ones love to pounce on us when we’re down. Hey asstard, remember: 24-12 despite our team “cheating.” So how about that stale, hackneyed “there’s always next year” by NeuWeasal? 
Go back, to your coddled bubble in Westwood, pursue your unchallenging liberal arts/humanities degree at ucl-gay, and talk about how your school is so academically prestigious when majority of your undergrads pursue bullshyt, EASY, non-math/science based majors like ethnic-studies, poli-sci and whatever worthless, underwater basket weaving “I can’t find a job” with this hyped up jr. college degree aka ucla-BA.
You seem very articulate…couldn’t dispute the facts so back to more whining and 3rd-grade insults.  I’m sorry you couldn’t get into ‘UCL-gay’, ‘ass-tard’. Even OJ is ashamed of you…
Whine on, trOJan!
Juice Duece,
One would assume that you work for the NCAA based on your ability to make up facts. USC’s Football program had not been recently sanctioned nor penalized for past violations. Furthermore, the NCAA is unable to punish the Football program for violations of other teams. The NCAA took 4 years to investigate this matter even thou they claim they had such solid evidence. One does not take 4 years to complete an investigation when the evidence is solid. This was a hit job on the Trojans by the NCAA because no one was able to compete with them on the recruiting front nor on the football field. Those are the facts!
No, I don’t work for the NCAA, conspiracy theorist (your tin-foil hat seems to be cutting off circulation to your brain).  Based on your response, you are CLEARLY Joey Kaufman’s dad! Great logic…
A simple Google search will show you that the trOJans were indeed on probation during these ADDITIONAL violations.  And your attempt to discredit the NCAA’s findings because of the amount of time it took to come to light doesn’t invalidate what was proven.  Your attempt at spin, deflection, scapegoating, and fingerpointing is SO classic trOJan.  ZERO accountability, one HUNDRED percent misplaced pride.
Man up, and accept your penance.  Quit whining.
P.S. Did you seriously just say that the NCAA can’t punish other sports due to lack of Institutional Control?  The violations were spread amongst several sports, and the respective sports get their just desserts.  Try again.
Juice Deuce,
No conspiracy theory at all. Just calling you out on your lack of knowledge. USC Football was not on active sanctions when the Bush judgement came down. Furthermore, the amount of time it took does matter. The NCAA took less than two weeks to close the allegations against Florida. Less than 48 Hours to drop the allegations against Cam and Auburn. This after trying to cover up the allegations for 9 months. And less than two months to pass their judgement on Ohio State. All 3 judgements completely contradicted  their judgement against USC. Yet it took 4 years for them to investigate allegations against USC which were made by a former convicted felon. These are the facts, something you’re clearly are unable to refute. Lastly, where in my response did you see me mention lack of institutional control. I clearly pointed out that violations and sanctions by the Basketball program have nothing to do with the Football team. Clearly, you UCLA boys need to man up and beat USC on the field and stop asking for the NCAA to help you out.
Look, you can’t be convinced that a history of cheating, malfeasance, violations, and probation had ANYthing to do with $c’s most recent punishment, so we’ll have to agree to disagree.
Please let me know about the next Dee, Conboy, and Ahmedinejad plot to take down the choir boys on Figueroa…won’t ya?
Morons, while fun to play with for a while, quickly exhaust my patience.
Cheat on for ol’ $c!
You lose the argument and then resort to name calling. Earlier you called out bRuined for the same thing. You should learn to take your own advice.
I spoke too soon.  I had NO idea of the level of idiocy that I’d be dealing with, when responding to n’er do-well “Trogans” on this site….a thousand apologies.  It’s people like YOU who vindicated OJ–I bet you could make excuses for Hitler, too (and how would your son Joey feel about that?)…what an unconscionable fool.  Goodbye, good riddance, and enjoy your fanboy status, loser.
I feel so belittled *gasp.* Go back, start writing your argumentative theses, for your EASY and worthless major–poli-sci, identity-politics–or whatever ucl-gay is putative for. You nor 99% or bRuins aren’t a direct reflection of the Nobel laureates nor the bio-med research. No, dumb dumb, the smart people do that; and yes, I’ll admit that a paucity of bRuins are smart albeit there are far more at SC relative to your glorified, super-community-college. 
So before you go around saying Trojans are crass/ghetto, stop calling USC “Figueroa Tech.”

You know Juice Deuce was a slight at OJ 2 (aka OJ Payo), right?  You’re right, your “school” is clearly superior…we’re all blessed by your linguistic sophistication and grace.
Go whine to your Daddy for more tuition money, my poet laureate friend.
As a USC alum, please just stop–your embarrassing yourself.
Really?? “Your coddled bubble in Westwood”??? would that be the same place that essentially ALL of the SC players rent tony condos? Do you not remember Leinart’s dad funding such a residence? Why not live near your beloved campus? Oh right, no answer needed. You all live in this so-called “bubble” because you p*$#%s can’t handle your own neighborhood. And that’s really the gist of it…calling everyone out because you can’t man up and take your biscuits like any other tainted program. Dee was after SC to redeem his MIami program of twenty-odd years ago??? Please! And Melissa Conboy of ND is out to avenge her fball program? ND beat your ass twelve years straight! Get over yourselves and quit your clown-ass whining. Take it and shut the *&$#@ up.
JJ,
Dee had no business being the man passing judgement on USC considering his past violations. Infact, he has no business working in this capacity for the NCAA under any circumstances. This is an obvious conflict of interest. Melissa Conboys conflict of interest is tied to the fact that ND is a long time rival of USC. And USC had beaten ND ass for 9 straight years when the judgement came down. Ms. Conboy clearly had an interest in the judgement against USC. Take your own advice and stop whining about the fact that USC has kicked UCLA’s ass for the last 11 of the past 12 years! As the Trojans proved on the field several months back the Trojans own LA.
Dear Fight On,
I realize that I am wasting my time with these posts, but let’s just, for fun, point out a few problems with your witty response. Although I grew up and still spend lots of time in SoCal, I graduated from Dartmouth and live in New York. Perhaps you, a trueTrojan genius, could point out where, precisely, I whined about USC kicking UCLA’s ass? I did not attend nor graduate from UCLA, so your Bruin ass-beatings don’t mean much to me, you’ll have to broaden your horizons a bit and come up with something more clever. As for the assumption that Conboy cannot be impartial because ND and SC are football rivals is a joke, as is pointing out that SC beat ND nine years straight while ignoring the fact that the Irish beat the Trojans ten years in a row before that. (BTW, I’m sure that I don’t need to stipulate to the fact that all your ’05 victories were vacated, right?) So, yes, you have your (cyclical) highs and lows, like just about every other program out there. Obviously for the SC crowd, those fabulous highs (now having been tainted by its participants) must be defended in order for you to keep that license plate frame on your snazzy car, because we all know, of course, that during the lows, SC fans are nowhere to be found…all tumbleweeds and crickets. So cling, if you must, to the notion that you getting what’s due is some sort of injustice. It’s just pathetic…and, unfortunately for SC’s reputation, typical.
DCTrojan,
I’m afraid that USC did claim that it should be let off the hook. They proposed exactly zero penalties on the football program for the Reggie Bush mess, instead they threw the basketball team under the bus and hoped that would satisfy the NCAA. Then Pete Carroll bolted town just ahead of the posse, and USC was crazy or desperate enough to hire Lane F’ing Kiffin and Ed the Ogre, who were both there during the time the Reggie Bush stuff was going on. Kiffin was on a record pace of NCAA violations, in the SEC of all places, and his recruits at Tennessee were on a record run of arrests. Talk about waving a red cape in front of the NCAA. The punishment may have been more severe than was warranted, but the NCAA hates hubris, and by failing to admit to any culpability at all and by hiring some of the same people that were there during the time the violations occurred ,USC was basically daring them to drop the hammer. Mission accomplished. Nobody admitted that USC did anything wrong until they started acting all contrite in hopes of leniency. Good luck with that.
“Kiffin was on a record pace of NCAA violations, in the SEC of all places, and his recruits at Tennessee were on a record run of arrests. Talk about waving a red cape in front of the NCAA.” 
I’m sorry, you must be confused. Kiffin didn’t coach at Ohio State or Florida.
DCTrojan,
The Basketball team was not thrown under the bus. There were actual violations that took place and the University reported them on their own. The hiring of Lane Kiffin had nothing to do with the sanctions that were dropped on the program. It had everything to do with the NCAA’s desire to bring down the Trojan Football program at any cost. There was absolutly no evidence to support the sanctions. It does not take 4 years to complete an investigation if the evidence is as solid as the NCAA claimed. I find your statement that the NCAA does not stand for hubris rather laughable  when you consider how the NCAA has handled the allegations at Florida, Ohio State, Alabama, and Auburn. The NCAA has no credibility left. And neither do you.
Fight On!
I think you were replying to me, not DCTrojan. Thank you for helping me make my point about many USC fans not admitting any fault by the football program. Just to be clear, USC has now, somewhat belatedly, admitted fault and has agreed to some, but not all, of the sanctions imposed. Clearly, there was evidence to support the sanctions or they would not have agreed to the year bowl ban and 5 scholarship reduction. Originally, USC denied any responsibility and self imposed no penalties on itself. I am aware that the basketball team was also actually guilty of violations, you don’t have to be innocent to be thrown under the bus. Your ex AD apparently thought that by admitting guilt and self imposing penalties for the basketball program, it would impress the NCAA and they would agree to accept no penalties for the football program. He was clearly mistaken. As for your contention that the NCAA desired to bring down the USC football program at all cost, why? Why would they arbitrarily decide to smack down an innocent USC? How does the NCAA benefit in any way? Don’t give me any of those silly SEC-ESPN-NCAA-BCS conspiracy theories, how do they benefit by tearing down USC, which is in one of the largest media markets in the United States?
“BOO HOO Cheaters!Excuses, excuses…perhaps if U$C or Reggie Bush were able to admit wrongdoings it would have been a slap on the wrist. Not seeing Carrol’s timing to leave Troy as another red flag is just delusional. It was apparent $C was a loose ship run by fools. Karma’s a horse!”
The funniest thing about morons like scotty is that USC didnt gain ANYTHING from what Bush did. The whole Bush deal was for his NFL business, it had nothing to do with playing at USC. What an ignorant jealouse little bunch of fools. Doesnt matter what happens, in two years, USc will be back in teh business of kicking YOUR SCHOOLS BUTT again, and all you will be able to do is cry and pray for the NCAA to step in to help you beat us…lol!!! What a bunch of losers.
This has to be one of the most ignorant and ridiculous statemets ever uttered, and the sad thing thing is someone is willing to tie their name to it. I see you have great respect for yourself Gary…lol!!!!!!
“Was USC fair to the tams they played with CHEATING ineligible player?”
Auburn pays it’s players through casinos and done in such a cryptic way the NCAA will never sort it out (at the rate they do things) Cam Newton was shopped by an agent and should have been ruled a professional and inelligible.  Since he was a one man team that wasn’t going to happen. Too bad for teams that follow the rules.
Was USC fair to the tams they played with CHEATING ineligible player?
Gary, how is the fact that  USC unwittingly played an athlete, who was recruited legitimately and  declared “ineligible” retroactively,   considered “cheating”?  It is astonishing to me that the NCAA can knowingly allow 5 ineligible athletes to play in the Sugar Bowl after punishing USC —  past, present and future — for unknowingly playing one ineligible athlete.
Great analysis, Joey. I couldn’t agree more, and I’m glad the DT is still bringing its A-game.
Don’t forget Alabama. Another case where improper benefits were being given by Bama staff to their players, and yet a more lenient penalty.
Or even the Miami case. Despite the massive scandal involving over 70 players in 3 programs (vs. our 1, 2 if you count Mayo), over many seasons (vs. our 1), they got only one postseason ban and 31 scholarship cuts (vs. our 2 year postseason ban and 30 scholarship cuts). 
I don’t understand their reasoning for this. Anyone who knows NCAA rules knows that the max scholarships that should have been taken from USC should have been 4 per year for a total of 12, and one postseason ban. 
The NCAA clearly operated with an agenda in USC’s case. Whether it was to make an example, whether it was distaste of USC’s media friendly program, whether it was to eliminate USC’s recruiting empire…it was an agenda, and whenever you use an agenda, you throw out discretion.
May the NCAA , for once, look at this in a fair and objective manner and decide what is right over what is convenient.
That was a great article, Joey!
BOO HOO Cheaters!Excuses, excuses…perhaps if U$C or Reggie Bush were able to admit wrongdoings it would have been a slap on the wrist. Not seeing Carrol’s timing to leave Troy as another red flag is just delusional. It was apparent $C was a loose ship run by fools. Karma’s a horse!
Oh for heaven’s sake, Scotty88. It’s not excuses. No-one is claiming that SC should have been let off the hook. All the administration is asking for is that the NCAA stick to their published standards – instead of making up a higher compliance bar to justify stronger penalties, ignoring their own by-laws about COI composition, breaking their own rules about COI / investigator contact, and essentially manufacturing a narrative to support their claim that McNair knew what was happening from the beginning. Perhaps you think that the NCAA separated out the appeals process to have McNair address his punishment separately for convenience; I can’t help but wonder why they didn’t want to have that be part of the record for SC to appeal. 
All things being equal, I am willing to bet that the result of the appeals process will be BOHICA. If the NCAA was either straight or honest about being biased, I wouldn’t mind. But they are pissing on our shoes and telling us it’s raining, and no-one need be expected to take that in silence.

A barrage of three-pointers by senior guard Donte Smith was not enough for USC as they fell to California Saturday night, 68-66.
Smith made 8-of-12 three-pointers for a career-high 24 points in 29 minutes off the bench. His eight three-point baskets were the second-most by a Trojan in a game, and only one less than Anthony Pendleton made on Dec. 9, 1987.

“I do not care if I have a career-best game,” Smith said. “If we lose, I am always going to be down.”
For as well as Smith played, junior forward Nikola Vucevic struggled. Vucevic was hit in the jaw early in the game, causing him to bleed from his nose and mouth. Vucevic fouled out of the game with only six points on two-of-eight shooting, and 10 rebounds.
“Nikola let an injury take him out of the game completely,” said USC coach Kevin O’Neill. “He needs to be able to deal with adversity during the course of games. Hopefully that will be something he can learn going forward.”
With Vucevic on the bench for much of the second half with four fouls, freshman forward Garrett Jackson saw increased playing time. Jackson had eight points and six rebounds off the bench, as USC’s reserves outscored California’s 32-9.
Freshman guard Maurice Jones added 10 points for the Trojans (11-9, 3-4). Junior guard Jio Fontan had eight points and a game-high seven assists.
Forward Harper Kamp led California (10-9, 3-4) with 19 points and seven rebounds. Center Mark Sanders-Frison contributed 12 points and eight rebounds for the Golden Bears.
It was a streaky game for USC.
The Trojans started the game cold, only making one of their first 11 shots, and the team took 4:43 seconds to score their first points, on a dunk by senior forward Alex Stepheson.
Smith came off the bench and hit two quick three pointers, sparking a 14-0 run that gave the Trojans a 16-8 lead.
After that point, however, the Golden Bears went on a 22-6 run of their own, and went into halftime with a 30-22 lead. The Trojans only shot .286 from the field in the opening half.
Smith continued his hot shooting in the second half. He scored 12 consecutive points for the Trojans, helping USC regain the lead at 52-50 on a three-point basket by Jackson.
The teams then traded leads. California gained momentum when Fontan was charged with an intentional foul against Kamp. The Golden Bears were awarded two free throws and the ball, allowing them to score four points on the possession and extend their lead to 62-57.
“I was not trying to hurt him,” Fontan said. “I was trying to go for the ball, and if I could not get the ball, I was not going to let him get an easy shot.”
The Trojans battled back and cut California’s lead to one point on a lay-up by Fontan. On the next possession, the Golden Bears made the second of two free throws.
USC had six seconds to take the ball the length of the court with no timeouts remaining, forcing Fontan to rush and take an off-balance three-pointer that bounced off the rim.
After allowing Stanford to only make .222 of their shots on Thursday, California shot .542 in the second half.
“We preach all the time if you do not play defense, you do not win,” O’Neill said. “We could not get stops in crucial situations.”
The Trojans travel to Tempe, Arizona to play at Arizona State Thursday.
USC does not return to the Galen Center until Feb. 10, when they host Oregon State.

USC took another step Saturday toward a final resolution in the NCAA infractions case stemming from allegations involving former Trojans Reggie Bush and O.J. Mayo.
Pleading its case· President C. L. Max Nikias and other school officials hope to soften NCAA-levied sanctions handed down last June. - Carlos Acenas | Daily Trojan 
A USC contingent consisting of President C. L. Max Nikias, athletic director Pat Haden, vice presidents Todd Dickey and David Roberts, general counsel Carol Mauch Amir and outside counsel William King III  spent four hours and 13 minutes outlining their appeals case Saturday for reduced sanctions in front of the NCAA Infractions Appeals Committee in Indianapolis.
“I want to thank the NCAA for giving us the opportunity before the committee for a good and fair hearing,” Nikias told reporters following the meeting. “We just have to wait for the ruling.”
A decision is expected to be rendered in four to eight weeks.
On June 11, 2010 the NCAA levied severe sanctions on the Trojan football program, including a two-year bowl ban and loss of 30 scholarships over the course of three seasons.
Through the appeals process, USC hopes the sanctions brought against its football program will be cut in half. In an ideal scenario, USC would be bowl eligible beginning in 2011 and would be allowed to carry 80 scholarship players, as opposed to the previously restricted 75.
The appeals committee can decide to reduce the bowl ban, reduce the scholarship restrictions, reduce both or leave the entire punishment as prescribed. Before the hearing, Michael L. Buckner, a lawyer who has handled NCAA appeals cases before, told Michael Lev of the Orange County Register, he believed USC had a chance to win back scholarships, but that the bowl ban would likely remain intact.
In January 2008, the NCAA changed its procedures for appeals hearings and made it harder for institutions to win their cases. Schools must now prove that the Committee on Infractions made procedural errors or used egregious discretion in its initial ruling. Since the rule change, only one out of eleven appeals has been successful.
Before the hearing, Haden said he hoped for a favorable outcome, but was “realistic” and aware of the chances of winning.
Even after the hearing, the question remains as to exactly how many players USC can sign for its upcoming 2011 recruiting class, with players able to sign letter of intents beginning Feb. 2.
If the committee rules before the signing period ends April 1, the NCAA could decide to levy the scholarship reductions on the 2011 class. If a decision comes after April 1, however, the penalty will be stayed and the reduced scholarship numbers will be in effect from 2012 through 2014.
At this point, it appears USC coach Lane Kiffin plans to sign 20 players with the hope of winning the scholarship portion of the appeal. To date, the Trojans have 17 verbal commitments that make up the fourth best recruiting class in the country according to Yahoo! Sports’ Rivals.com.
No matter what decision the appeals committee renders, it will be the resolution to the case, according to Haden.
Earlier this month, Haden described Saturday’s hearing as the “final frontier” and promised that USC would not take legal action against the NCAA if the penalties are upheld, despite a recent USCFootball.com report insinuating differently.
Having pleaded their case, the only thing remaining for the Trojans to do is to wait for a verdict.

Academics and intellectuals recently have been lamenting what they perceive as the slow, torturous death of the humanities and other majors seen as less “practical” and lacking enough potential to translate into a successful job.
Cindy Lee | Daily Trojan
USC has managed to foster at least a basic appreciation for the arts and humanities, and for the most part  has avoided the polarizing trend toward colleges as pre-professional factories.
USC prides itself on offering a well-rounded education comparable to a small liberal arts college, but with the financial support and global resources of a research university.
Traditionally, liberal arts education emphasizes critical thinking and personal intellectual development, as opposed to providing more technical or specific skills for a future career.
Students might bemoan the general education, foreign language and writing requirements, but USC nevertheless maintains a strong core.
The College of Letters, Arts & Sciences, for example, requires undergraduates to complete one course from six different categories spanning scientific inquiry to global cultures and traditions. Students enroll in two writing courses, WRIT 140 and WRIT 340, and must complete the equivalent of three semesters of a foreign language.
USC treats students to a generous selection of interdisciplinary majors as well, such as Health and Humanity; Politics, Law and Society; and International Relations Global Business, to name a few, which also serve to broaden perspectives and help students realize the interdisciplinary nuances behind problems.
Though USC values the broad scope of a liberal arts education, it is still behind other colleges in realizing those values.
Students at the University of Chicago, which arguably has one of the best core curriculum programs in the nation, engage in more than 15 quarters of interdisciplinary general education. Students accrue six quarters in the Humanities, Civilization Studies and the Arts cluster.
They also must complete at least two quarters in the physical sciences, two quarters in the biological sciences, one quarter in mathematics and at least one more quarter in the sciences. The last cluster covers three quarters of social sciences.
Admittedly, with fewer general education requirements, it becomes easier to add a major or minor. Flexibility appeals to many students and certainly plays a prominent role in attracting the soon-to-be-incoming freshman class.
USC enthusiastically encourages pursuing several diverse interests without regard to the increasing concern over the career “usefulness” of a certain major.
For example, a psychology major could relatively easily merge his or her interests in comparative literature, and possibly graduate as a Renaissance Scholar, a distinction awarded to undergraduates who pursue “widely separated fields of study.”
But to realize an interest in comparative literature to begin with, perhaps the student had first been “forced” to take a class in British literature or a culture studies poetry course.
A student who enters with a single-minded pursuit of pre-med might emerge from a western civilizations and history class with a new double major in biological Sciences and philosophy.
As for students who intend to double major and view general education courses as a burden on their limited units, other measures can be taken to ensure there is enough time to complete their intended interests, but not at the expense of a background in other studies.
USC sponsors an incredible number of seminars and programs dedicated to engaging and provoking interdisciplinary thought. The College Commons, the Levan Institute for Humanities, Annenberg, Visions and Voices and a plethora of other series abound. Perhaps USC could offer two-unit classes which require attendance and reflection on these events,  so that students are active participants in their general education.
A desire for students to be successful in their future careers is not mutually exclusive with a liberal arts education, and sustaining a strong foundation in the humanities does not preclude dynamic programs in the sciences.
USC already cultures an atmosphere of community learning and interdisciplinary thought, but should continue to prove itself by not forgetting the foundations of a scholar in the creation of a professional.
Rebecca Gao is a freshman majoring in global health and biological sciences. Her column, “Trojan Grounds,” runs Mondays. 
It is precisely this kind of an attitude that has allowed us to slip behind the rest of the world in terms of education standards. Universities in China are definitely not encouraging students to “follow their passion” and spend 4 yrs learning something like philosophy or sociology. They send them into science, business, or engineering so that they have a tangible skill which translates into a job.
As a society we need to to place less value on this culture of experts. Experts are what managed to get us into a financial fiasco that we are just starting to pull ourselves out of the wreckage from. Experts managed to pull us into a war with no end in site and no clear victory goal to achieve. Experts are what causes so many kids to become medicated and diagnosed with ailments that were close to non-existent in previous generations or elsewhere in much of the world. I understand a general liberal arts degree feel rudderless because the student graduates from college after 4 years and does not have a field or profession to cling to. However, I would argue in many cases that student is much more prepared to be trained into a profession – highly technical or otherwise and can also understand its relevance within the context of greater society as a whole. Just listen to the idiotic pundits on news shows every night spewing out data like only experts and pundits can do. Hopefully we do not become a nation reliant on the wisdom of the experts only.
Experts are also the people finding new ways to treat diseases that someday might take your life prematurely. Experts are the ones developing new technologies to decrease our dependence on dirty fossil fuels that, if not causing global warming, are certainly causing us to breathe the accumulated smog here in the LA basin. In direct response to your comments: experts are also the ones figuring out how to get our out of the economic crisis (do you, as a non-expert have any great ideas supported by research and data?). Experts are also the ones that have brought infant mortality in the US to the lowest rate in recorded history.  
The big fallacy in your arguments is that (with one exception), you are talking about experts whose actions are motivated by POLITICS. You are ignoring the vast world of experts who are simply trying to do what they can do to make the world better. 
I hope that we don’t become a nation of people like you who don’t value the education and expertise of the people who innovate and create and without whose expertise you’d be sitting in the dark reading a papyrus page by oil lamp. Or, maybe you’d like that?
I don’t know?. A close friend of mine has a psych/linguistics degree from prestigious University of California, Berkeley, but she struggled for years after college to secure employment. She even went on to get her PhD in this discipline, still a dismal situation. And you got to consider, this was prior to the economy taking a nosedive. 
I have no faith in liberal arts/humanities studies. My agenda isn’t the shallow goal of becoming wealthy, because you sure as hell can’t become wealthy with this under your belt. Developing an open mind and honing your critical thinking skills are beneficial, but putting all your eggs in this basket is a pyrrhic victory.

President C. L. Max Nikias told the Daily Trojan last week that he has decided to invest a significant amount of money into increasing off-campus security, including in the area west of Vermont Avenue, where the university’s presence has long been conspicuously absent. This is the right decision for students, for the community and for USC, and, perhaps most importantly, it demonstrates that Nikias is truly aware of and responsive to students’ concerns.
The university plans to install more cameras both north and west of campus, and it will also increase the number of yellow-jacket security guards in the area. The improved security will come not come cheap — Nikias estimated about $3 million per year — but it is a price well worth paying to ensure student safety.
USC has previously been anxious about moving west of Vermont. For a while, rather than venturing into the west side, the university instead tried to draw students back to the North University Park area. But for students simply looking for an affordable place to live, the west side holds more appeal than luxury complexes like Gateway.
Finally, the university has acknowledged that the student presence west of campus is permanent. Finally, students will no longer have to choose between safety and affordability.
Dept. of Public Safety officials say the danger of the west side is overstated, and that it is merely a matter of perception. Even if that is true, however, students deserve the perception of safety when they’re walking home from school. And if crime rates are already low, imagine how much lower they could be with security officers, cameras and increased patrols.
The choice to invest in student safety is clearly the right one — and even more encouraging is Nikias’ reason for making that decision.
It was students, he said. Students asked Nikias what he was going to do about safety west of campus, so he answered. He listened to students, and he took action.
As students, we appreciate that Nikias took the time to listen to our questions and our concerns, and we are impressed by how quickly he acted in addressing them. We hope this is a trend that will continue through the rest of Nikias’ presidency.
The last thing USC is more security guards and surveillance cameras.  In the news article, Nikias said he had received mostly positive support from local community organizations.  I really doubt that.  I’ve worked closely with some of the local organizations and been to community council meetings and I’m sure that most of them vigorously oppose this.  Why didn’t Nikias mention the names of the community orgs he ‘talked’ to?
USC, keep your greedy, creepy, peering eyes and fingers out of the community.
War is Peace
Freedom is Slavery
Ignorance is Strength
Max–would you also like USC to take back the aid and support it offers to local schools and the money it pours into the South Central community? Think first, then write.

It was my first day on the west side. With the aid of a U-Haul and a shopping cart, I had lugged all my belongings from The Spot on 30th Street, with its sheen and its swanky name, to West 36th Street. I was sitting on my porch, watching the smog set, when I heard a cheerful greeting.
“The cats bothering you yet?”
Julia Vann| Daily Trojan
It was my neighbor to the right, an affable man in his mid-seventies with deep-set laugh lines and a booming voice that belied his old age.
“What cats?” I asked.
“Oh, I’m just kidding,” he said, before pausing and adding, soberly, “They’re all dead.”
This was my first taste of the community west of Vermont Avenue — an idiosyncratic group composed of USC students, recent graduates and local residents who have lived in this neighborhood for decades.
Students who live north of campus are generally apprehensive of the area, which has a reputation for being the dodgy section of USC’s perimeter. This notoriety has been heavily enforced by the noticeable lack of USC security on this side.
That will be changing this year. President C. L. Max Nikias told the Daily Trojan last week that USC will be bringing CSC guards and security cameras to the west side of campus for the first time, in an estimated $3 million-a-year push that will be in place by fall.
The university’s decision to address security on the west side is commendable; USC is finally providing a necessary service to both its students and the community west of Vermont. More importantly, this decision marks an important shift in university attitude toward expansion.
Instead of simply trying to lure USC students away from the west side with new housing developments such as the University Gateway housing flagship, USC is  acknowledging that the west side has certain draws that North University Park doesn’t, such as more affordable housing, proximity to campus and a close-knit community between students and local residents, to name a few.
When I interviewed Dept. of Public Safety Capt. David Carlisle last semester about why USC hadn’t posted CSC guards on the west side, he was quick to point out that the majority of students live to the north of campus.
“USC doesn’t own student housing west of Vermont,” he said. “We wanted to best utilize our resources where the students are most likely to be. We analyzed that area based on student foot traffic patterns, student housing and also where crimes have occurred.”
USC doesn’t officially own any complexes on the west side, but there is a small, burgeoning pocket of students who live there.
The west side is a vibrant part of the university experience and has a dynamic that can’t be found north of campus.
The university should acknowledge that fact, rather than try to tempt a diaspora to the north with tufts of luxury housing.
I recently took to the street with another Daily Trojan reporter to gauge reactions from west side residents about the proposed security additions, which were overwhelmingly positive.
The sound of loud music brought us to a garage, where we met Rick Jones, a resident on Budlong Avenue for 10 years who displayed an amiable nature I’d already experienced with other residents.
After inviting us to a dominoes tournament and a meeting of a west side cricket club, he told us he was in favor of USC’s move for more security.
Then he pointed down the street at a distant stucco house.
“Those guys at the yellow house … They hang out over there because they actually take care of the ’SC girls,” he said. “You know, they see you walking or whatever, they’ll make sure that you get a lookout. They’re a different kind of people. They won’t disrespect you.”
Loretta Session, a one-year resident of 36th Street, echoed his sentiments, and said that the integration of students into the community was beneficial.
“It’s pretty nice. Even the partygoers kinda keep to themselves,” she said. “The kids are pretty respectful.”
USC residents were forseeably excited about the security additions. Max Feinstein, a senior majoring in neuroscience and philosphy, pumped his fist when he heard the news, before sardonically lamenting, “Just in time for me graduating.”
“As a student, it’s fantastic to hear that there’s going to be campus security over here,” he said. “I have difficulty imagining it won’t be beneficial for the community.”
It’s not surprising that both students and local residents alike would be excited about the addition of security cameras and guards on the west side. Even though the university might be wary of exerting its presence west of campus, there are few who would object to a couple more pairs of watchful eyes.
But most importantly, these changes will bring to the area what they brought to North University Park a year and a half ago: the image of safety. The west side endures as bad a rap among USC students as USC’s campus does among out-of-staters. In fact, most of the people I talked to felt that the community was one of the safer ones in the area because of its proximity to the university.
With the placement of yellow jackets, we can only hope that more students are encouraged to room on the west side, or perhaps just visit. USC has long congratulated itself on its commitment to the surrounding community, and it deserves whatever accolades are thrown at it. But with the added security improvements, the university is finally acknowledging an important facet of the USC family.
As Jones said, “We’re close knit down here. We look out for each other.”
What could be more Trojan than that?

The story of Scoops Westside, a new ice cream store opened by USC alumnus Matthew Kang, began when Kang, a business administration major, decided to approach the owner of his favorite ice cream café.
Scoops offers quality ice cream but keeps the menu simple with 10 consistent flavors.
It happened at the original Scoops location on Heliotrope Drive near Melrose Avenue, which Kang would visit almost every day during his commute home from school.
The owner, Tai Kim, was lunching on a sloppy bagel sandwich when Kang first spoke to him. “Did you attend culinary school?” he asked.
Kim’s eyes flashed indignantly. “Attend? I used to teach culinary school!”
Kang knew then that he had found a serious foodie. The two soon formed a close friendship, bonding not only over their common Korean-American heritage, but also their zeal for food. Kim became Kang’s culinary mentor.
“Tai taught me a lot about food,” Kang said. “He would take me out to eat all these new and interesting dishes, and he would always be thinking about how to translate them into ice cream.”
It was through Kim and his exotic ice cream creations that Kang got to try his first black truffle and foie gras. As his taste buds evolved, so did his career dreams.
While his fellow Marshall classmates crunched numbers at summer internships, Kang spent his free time watching the Food Network and perfecting his risotto-making skills.
“Ice cream man” isn’t typically the career aspiration for most college graduates, especially for a student like Kang. But after his graduation in 2007 and a two-year stint working as a credit analyst at City National Bank, Kang realized his heart was not in the corporate world.
In 2009, Kang left his position at City National Bank. For the next 18 months, he studied food more intensely. He regularly updated his food blog, “Mattatouille.” He scoured the city for “crazy food adventures” and coffee tastings with fellow bloggers. He worked with Kim for six months, learning the tricks needed to run a successful ice creamery.
Finally, on Dec. 1, 2010, he opened Scoops Westside in the Palms neighborhood of Los Angeles with grand plans to sweeten up the area.
“Palms is an under-served neighborhood,” Kang said. “There’s no place to hang out. It’s a dead zone. I want to help make Palms a gastronomically cool destination.”
But Kang has a different idea of cool.
Tucked in the middle of an obscure strip mall on Overland Avenue, Scoops Westside does not sizzle hip or haute. Instead, the décor is simple and plain. Bare pastel walls, food magazines neatly stacked on clean tables and a single planter filled with white orchids by the counter.
Instead of clashing with the modest backdrop of Palms, Scoops Westside has a soft, comforting personality. Kang plays owner, operations manager, server, cashier and errand boy. He does everything from ice cream pick-ups and handling checkbooks to entertaining customers and wiping ice cream spills, all while marketing himself via Twitter and Facebook.
“I don’t even get a break to eat,” Kang said. “My friends take pity on me and bring me food.”
But Kang says things have changed for the better. Instead of eyeing the clock impatiently so he can hop out of his office cubicle and into his next edible adventure, Kang now has the perfect excuse to dream about food all day, specifically, new flavor combinations for his ever-changing ice cream menu, which he composes with Kim.
Kang offers seven to 10 different ice cream flavors on a daily rotation, two of which are dairy free. He keeps the selection limited so that he can have a quick turnover of the daily batches, thus offering consistently fresh dishes.
But certain flavors, like the brown bread ice cream, make frequent reappearances. This customer favorite is neither brown nor bready, but smooth and crunchy, sweet and toasty. It is an intense milky concoction swirled with crackles of grape nuts. Even those who shun the health-nut breakfast cereal will not be able to resist the delightful contrast of textures and flavors in one creamy lick.
Other flavors are similarly innovative and never dull, such as cinnamon cashew, coconut white chocolate wasabi and salted honey. Some are more popular than others, but Kang’s goal is to encourage even the most timid eaters to try unconventional flavors in the conventional form of ice cream.
For Kang, the constant flavor experiments are not about building the perfect ice cream.
“Everyone has a different idea of what perfect is,” he said. “I think the perfect ice cream is one that gives you joy.”
Judging by the happy grins on his customers’s faces, Kang’s Scoops Westside appears to churn sweet, creamy perfection.
Giyeaah, SC alums blazing trails. I admire how SC peeps don’t always become automatons in corporate America. That’s for people who lack business acumen, creativity, and are too scurred to be independent. Crunching numbers and using formulae from accounting/finance courses should be used as expedients in the real business world, not to perfunctorily repeat at some firm so your mind stales. Corporate America is nothing but a big game that ultimately burns you out.
Way to follow your dreams!!  Kudos to you for taking a road to happiness instead of wasting years behind a desk!
Best of luck with your store.  I live in Chicago, so sadly I won’t be visiting any time soon.

Injuries, especially for athletes, are among the worst disruptions to personal exercise regimens.
They not only inhibit physical movement but also muddy your outlook for the future. The whole world seems to stop and every little thing you used to do, every little step, every gesture, requires painstaking effort.
How on earth do you stay fit during such a stressful time? What can you do if you’ve broken an arm? An ankle? A leg?
Injuries shouldn't stop your workout. | Creative Commons
Instead of seeing injury as the end to good fitness and overall health, look at it as a temporary break — no pun intended — from an already hackneyed routine.
Injuries provide a good time to take advantage of other fields of fitness and to try new things. Yes, I’m talking about that neat little term called cross-training.
For the majority of stubborn folks, the idea of broadening fitness horizons isn’t exactly appealing.
But waiting two or three months for an injury to fully heal can mean waiting an equal or even longer extent to return to your original routine. In such a lengthy period, you’re bound to lose the conditioning you worked so hard for pre-injury.
The goal of cross-training is not to maintain peak performance levels but to allow for the safe continuation of a fit and healthy lifestyle without compromising the recovery process.
Of course, those attempting to implement new fitness routines should always check with their personal physicians prior to starting any intense regimens.
Cross-training can be useful for the injured, but the most important aspect of recovery is rest.
Leg, Ankle and Knee Injuries:
Lower body injuries are some of the most debilitating, but that doesn’t mean they should be used as an excuse to sit around and shout at the TV all day.
Even if you’ve been confined to crutches or a wheelchair, don’t assume you’re immediately an outcast from the fitness world. Take it as an opportunity to shift your focus and begin building upper body strength.
Dumbbells are a good place to start, so head to the gym and give one a lift. You can sit or stand, depending on the severity of your injury, and still get as good a workout either way.
Dumbbells allow for a variety of moves, such as front and lateral raises or bicep and concentration curls. Always begin with smaller weights, especially if upper body fitness is relatively new to you. For the severely immobilized, lighter dumbbells can be purchased for under $30 online.
If you’re closing in on the end of your recovery period, swimming is a great way to reintroduce cardio exercise. The buoyancy of the water helps you refrain from putting any excess weight on the injured lower body, but kicking and leg extension are big no-no’s that can lead to further injury. Instead, opt for floaters and other buoy devices to limit movement of the injured areas.
Too busy for a trip to the gym or pool? Take your crutches for a walk. When properly used, crutches can act as temporary workout machines.
What a lot of people don’t know is that the proper usage of crutches requires immense strength in the arms and hands (not the armpits), and moving long distances can positively affect the triceps.
Arm and Shoulder Injuries:
Upper body injuries, though annoying, are not usually as impairing as lower body ones. Without the utility of the arms and hands, the cross-training focus should now shift to the lower body, primarily the legs.
One of the easiest and most convenient workouts is to go for a walk, whether it’s on a treadmill, around campus or just to the mailbox and back. Walking will provide you with increased stamina, even if it’s not at an Olympic pace.
For severe upper body injuries, though, keep the walking slow and steady. Don’t attempt a jog that could unnecessarily exacerbate shoulder pain.
Walking going well? Try adding some lunges to the routine. These simple strides will further improve the strength and flexibility in your quads and hamstrings.
Another option is to use stationary bicycles or elliptical machines.
Both stationary bikes and ellipticals are low-impact, cardio-centered tools that target not just the heart but the calves, glutes and core, providing you with a well-rounded workout.
So the next time you get an injury, don’t ignore the gym. Find new ways to work out and stay healthy.

The members of Good Neighbor comedy group credit USC with bringing them together.
Beck Bennett (‘07), Kyle Mooney (‘07) and Nick Rutherford (‘06) met while working together on Commedus Interruptus, the on-campus sketch comedy group. Along with friend Dave McCary, the four decided to pursue their comedic dreams beyond college and now have taken to the stage and the Internet with their eccentric comedy.

“We were relatively successful in college, and had gotten good feedback from our audiences, so we said let’s try and do this for real,” Mooney said.
With the help of McCary, who acts as editor and director, Good Neighbor decided to widen its fanbase by sharing their comedy through YouTube.
“We were performing regularly, and then at the end of every semester we would do a big sketch show. Naturally [Beck, Nick and I] gelled really well together when we were performing,” Mooney said.
The team then decided to put together a nationwide tour and booked several shows throughout the United States.
“The plan was to get an old school bus, convert it to biodiesel and do a grassroots tour across the country and then it boiled down to us borrowing our friends car on the east coast and doing shows at four different schools,” Rutherford said.
The tour proved challenging, but the group started to gain traction with their online presence.
“We started making videos for the sketch show and that became our springboard,” McCary said.
Good Neighbor tends to find comedy in everyday life, but more recently have found new sources of humor.
“We watch a lot of internet videos made by kids in random places that put up videos that only have 100 views. [The videos] are really captivating and weird and I think very influential for us … I’m a firm believer that the Internet and YouTube specifically is a goldmine of really funny and cool things,” Mooney said.
According to Bennett, the fuel for great comedy sketches can be found in the real and the ridiculous.
“Bill Murray’s character in Caddyshack, he got that from a street traffic director in Chicago that actually talked liked that and he would just go watch him,” Bennet said. “But with YouTube going the way it is, you don’t have to just stumble across those people.”
Taking cues from some of their favorite TV shows and actors, including Tim and Eric, Mr. Show, Family Matters and Bill Murray, the troupe has been able to develop a unique style of screwball comedy that has been noticed by many.
“I don’t think we’ve ever set a limit or a boundary [to our comedy],” McCary said. “We usually stay away from pop-culture and parody stuff just because naturally that’s not what we gravitate toward as comedians.”
Creating clips and doing shows has become the main focus of their lives.
They have found a niche and are working seriously to break into new audiences.
“We all come up with ideas individually or sometimes together if people are just riffing on something,” Bennett said. “We try to meet regularly and have pitch meetings just for ourselves.”
According to McCary, the group typically functions as a unit, meaning that any one of the foursome can help conceive a brilliant idea and turn it into something hilarious to further develop.
Now living together in Silverlake, the comedy team is working on creating new videos and playing new shows, while also writing and producing for prominent YouTube personas. And with a recent acknowledgment from Steven Spielberg, Good Neighbor seems to be taking off.
“When we started it was such a struggle to get people to listen to us,” Mooney said. “Just now are we beginning to get popular enough where people are seeking us out.”
Good Neighbor will be playing two shows at the UCB Theatre in Hollywood on Feb. 10 and 24.
Enjoyed the article.  I can wait to see their work on utube or in person would be even better.

As Billy Crystal’s character tries to prove in Nora Ephron’s classic romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally, men and women can never be friends because, according to him, “the sex part always gets in the way.”
Dorky duo · Natalie Portman’s acting performance seems out of place in this romantic comedy, while Ashton Kutcher stays true to his usual quirky and goofy acting persona. - Photo courtesy of Paramount  
In No Strings Attached, the sex part is the least of Ashton Kutcher’s and Natalie Portman’s worries, as they seek to discover whether men and women can maintain a friendship and resist developing feelings for one another while having sex — and lots of it.
The answer to this question, as anyone who has seen a romantic comedy or has common sense would know, is no.
The premise of the film is simple enough: Boy meets girl at summer camp while the two are in junior high, then boy meets girl again in adulthood.  When boy and girl  use each other for sex, complications arise.
A doctor working all hours of the day, Emma (Portman) instigates this purely physical relationship. Independent, strong-willed and slightly intimidated by affection, she fits the prototype of the 21st century female lead.
Emma also establishes the ground rules: No staring longingly into each other’s eyes, no jealousy and absolutely no spooning under any circumstances.
But rules in the movie world are meant to be broken, and this is where Adam (Kutcher) comes in. He agrees to become a “sex friend,” but is vulnerable, and yearns for something more from Emma.
The role reversal is refreshing yet it feels idealized. The two leads act like over-dramatized versions of real people, without letting their roles develop any depth or complexity.
But it’s not entirely their fault. Every time the film approaches an area of substance, what feels like 20 superfluous supporting actors jump in with a punch line or two.
Although Emma’s comedic roommates (Mindy Kaling, Greta Gerwig and Guy Branum) are a delight to watch onscreen, the casting of rapper Chris “Ludacris” Bridges is so off-key and random that it begs the question of why he is needed in the first place.
No Strings Attached follows a formula that is tried and tested by every prior romantic comedy. Director Ivan Reitman, of Ghostbusters fame, just barely bumps the movie to its R-rating.
Unfortunately, his attempt at the raunchy yet smart humor of Judd Apatow is more slapstick than witty.
Fresh off her critically acclaimed and haunting performance in Darren Aronofsky’s psychological thriller Black Swan, a role that snagged her a Golden Globe, Portman slides into the role of Emma like a bull in a china shop.
Clearly this genre is not for her, but she puts up a commendable first-time effort.
Kutcher, at least, has learned to embrace his inevitable fate of always being second best to a more dominant female lead. Here he is an accessory, but an affecting one nonetheless.
Clichéd, predictable and soon to be forgotten, No Strings Attached takes audiences on the same path that most romantic comedies tend to travel.

The No. 19 USC women’s tennis team defeated its second dual meet opponent of the season Friday, beating Long Beach State 6-1.
The Women of Troy (2-0) swept the doubles competition and won five out of six in the singles competition, earning the singles point.
Sophomore Danielle Lao and freshman Kaitlyn Christian took home two of five singles wins and the pair of junior Alison Ramos and sophomore Valeria Pulido won the No. 1 doubles slot.
USC coach Richard Gallien applauded the team’s efforts, but with some reservations.
“The girls competed very well,” Gallien said. “I’m not saying Long Beach State is UCLA, but I thought we performed very well.”
Over the last year, the Women of Troy have been known to fare well in doubles play, and Friday, they did not leave CSLB any breathing room.
“I’d say one of our big strengths is our doubles,” said senior Maria Sanchez. “We have three strong doubles teams so that will help a lot since doubles is so important.”
Although Sanchez did not participate in the competition against Long Beach, the rest of the team found success even without its top player.
CSLB’s sole point came from a singles match against senior Cristala Andrews, who was just coming back into action after sitting out due to an injury.
Given all these circumstances, the team fared well.
“[The dual meets] were certainly challenges because Maria missed these matches,” Gallien said. “In a way it’s turned out to be good since it put more pressure on us.”
Two weeks have passed since the end of winter break and Gallien credited the team’s dedication over the break as a reason for their success as well.
“We just finished this huge break without a lot of practice,” he said. “This time of year you are in big trouble if your team didn’t prepare over break.”
With this victory, the Women of Troy will now focus on their next competition. They will fly to Ann Arbor, Mich. next weekend to participate in their ITA Kick-Off Weekend.
They will face host Michigan, Auburn and NC State.
The team is confident it will be prepared for the upcoming NCAA tournament by competing and playing more matches.
“I think as we get more matches under our belt, we will continue to get into more of a rhythm and really be playing well by NCAAs,” Sanchez said. “Our goal is to win the NCAA tournament.”
