The student who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against a professor and USC responded to comments made by professor Erick Guerrero at a news conference Thursday.
Karissa Fenwick, a doctoral student at the School of Social Work, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the University and Guerrero, alleging USC did not impose disciplinary actions that she found sufficient after investigating a sexual harassment complaint she filed in January. 
During the press conference, Fenwick directly countered Guerrero’s claim that she was taking advantage of “a serious issue to continue her life of white privilege.”
“[Guerrero] is twisting the concept [of white privilege] around to use it to defend his position when in fact, he not only had gender privilege but more importantly, he was my direct supervisor and controlled my future,” Fenwick said. “He had a tremendous amount more power than I did in this situation.”
On Wednesday, Guerrero filed a demurrer, which denied all the allegations in the suit. 
“Many of the causes are very small false narratives, and then [the plaintiff] tries to create a significant base out of them,” said Mark Hathaway, Guerrero’s attorney. “I don’t think any reasonable person would read the complaint and think it was gender violence, retaliation or a hostile work environment.”
Emma Aguila, Guerrero’s wife and an assistant professor at USC, stated support for her husband in an email to the Daily Trojan.
“Erick values his reputation in our Trojan community and he has always been very careful in dealing with co-workers and students to avoid any misunderstandings,” Aguila wrote. “With all my heart, I stand by him. I believe in USC as a great institution and I know the truth will prevail.”
In a letter sent to Guerrero on Sept. 7, Martin Levine, vice provost and senior adviser to the provost, notified Guerrero that he would be suspended from teaching doctoral students among other consequences starting Fall 2018.
However, USC’s statement to the Daily Trojan on Wednesday stated that he was barred from teaching and supervising students starting this academic year.
The provost’s office declined to comment on the change from the statement to the letter, since they are unable to discuss specific personnel issues.
The letter to Guerrero also stated that there were multiple offenses. 
Following other issues with administrators and faculty members that have come to light over the past several months, the University created a task force that will oversee and implement workplace standards to prevent similar issues in the future, a spokesperson from the provost’s office said. 
A new vice provost of leadership development and evaluation will also be established and will oversee hiring processes and the work environment, according to USC.
While the University has made these changes to address the issues related to harassment and misconduct at the administrator and faculty level, some students at the Suzanne Dworak-Peck School of Social Work said they believe this is not enough.
Robin Petering and Rebecca Lengnick-Hall, two doctoral students at the School of Social Work, created a group called Social Workers to End Rape Culture in response to the recent sexual harassment allegations against Guerrero. 
In a statement Thursday, they announced their support for Fenwick and victims of sexual misconduct at USC.
“It is unacceptable that a school of social work, grounded in the values of social justice and equity, would condone the actions of one of its tenured professors in perpetuating such a negative and unsafe culture,” the statement read. “This coalition feels that the administration’s response has demonstrated that they are not committed to maintaining a culture of safety, transparency and accountability in regards to sexual harassment and misconduct.”
According to Petering, the coalition has 60 former and current students and nine faculty members, but she expects these numbers to grow. 
“[We want to] acknowledge and support Karissa in how brave she is,” Petering said. “This is not easy to do. She took a big risk in an effort for a lot of people. We’re here to support her and future students who could be victims of sexual harassment and assault.”
The Dean’s office in the School of Social Work did not provide a comment at the time of publication.

I hope this young lady finds peace and may I suggest prayer is often the fastest way to find peace in almost every situation.
All ladies should realize that when you enter a man’s hotel room to do anything other than change the sheets, you are entering potentially dangerous territory.
They will not read it because they are all bullies and want to see one side to the story. It’s unfortunate if this is the graduate students the school is producing. THERE GO the school ranking!
Dr. Guerrero is disciplined and always respectful of our academic community. I have been around him during conferences and he is reserved.
Being respectful in public does not exclude you from being a sexual perpetuator in private.  -Neither does being a father or being married- as EG is claiming.
He danced on a table in our doctoral theory class (which was irrelevant to the topic of discussion). That was neither reserved…nor appropriate. I support Karissa and any other student who is the victim of sexual harrassment or assault.
OMG are you for real? HE HUGGED ME ONCE is that considerate sexual assault too? this is getting pathetic honestly and blown out of context. Just because he is a man he isn’t allowed to be happy, dance and go near a female student?
AGREED!
I am very proud of Karissa for coming forward!  That takes incredible courage and strength.  I am confident USC will make the correct decision in not allowing sexual predators to remain working for this University in ANY capacity.  I stand in support of the countless faculty and students who have come together in support of Karissa and have demanded the termination of Dr. Guerrero.
I truly hope you if you have heard these things you will report it to the school. That isn’t right of her to making fun of others that way.
I understand students taking a stance and trying to do the “right” thing. However, you fail to understand that this has not been proven in court yet. She has made allegations that he has backed up and had evidence against. However, the school still decided to do what they felt was necessary so that he would get some sort of punishment and she would not be dismissed. 
Everyone on here is taking this to an extreme and making statements that are very hurtful to people that know and respect Dr. Guerrero. It is unfair to ruin someone’s career over “allegations.” If students on here commenting are truly social workers then they should respect our code of ethics. Nothing’s been proven, and at this point it could go ether way, and the court will decide this fairly. If this guy was truly a predator then we would hear of more cases coming out against him. HOWEVER, all we are hearing about within the school is how numerous faculty and students are supporting him as well. His own wife is supporting him too. If he was such an awful person it would not be so. We have heard things around campus about Karissa and other faculty members as well being “involved.” But I would never point fingers on her, instead we will see what the court decides in due time.
Do the right thing, and CLOSE your mouth at this point. I am also a student in the program. This is bigger than all of us.
Sarah,  I think you haven’t really researched what has transpired thus far.   Karissa’s allegations were backed up and decided to be true by a 5 month plus internal USC investigation.  Dr. Guerrero tried to appeal the decision once found responsible by this investigation and submitted unsubstantiated claims and witnesses that didn’t actually benefit him.  His appeal was denied and the investigation concluded still in supported Karissa.  Once that was determined the University levied some punishments against him to keep his involvement with students limited.  This most believe was not enough and woefully inadequate, including the victim Karissa who felt the only way to make serious change was to sue him and the school.  
Everyone (His peer faculty and students) are extremely upset with Dr. Guerrero’s behavior and the schools lack of a more severe punishment.  Unfortunately Dr. Guerrero was solely responsible for ruining his own career not all of the students and faculty and certainly not Karissa.  The people commenting ARE social workers at USC as I recognize their names not hidden behind “John Doe’s” or “Sarah H.’s”.  This is not the time to stay silent and “CLOSE” our mouths.  This is the time to stand up for whats right and speak out.  Too much of sexual crime is kept secret and swept under the carpet.  Its time that we stand up for strong people like Karissa.
First of all SETH. I am an actual student at the school as well. So just because you do not agree with my statements does not give you the right to harass my comment and make it seem as though I am a fake person. 
For your information, I do know what is going on. Did you know that half of the information that was used against Dr. Guerrero was also NOT made available to him until she filed the lawsuit against him? So whoever “Student X” is was never even brought to his attention. So pretty much any person who EVER had an issue with him could have been interviewed by the school and made false accusations about him to bring him down. 
Were there video cameras that followed them that day at the conference? How can these accusations even be proven that she is making. Do you know him personally to attack his character like this? I AM GUESSING YOU DONT. Well guess what I do. I have taken classes with him, and he has mentored close FEMALE friends of mine, so next time carefully think about what you are saying and for making it seem as though I am a fake person. HOW DARE YOU!? If you are truly a social worker then you need to go read the code of ethics again. Just because you don’t agree with what I am saying doesn’t give you the right to tear me down or others who support him. As I said before CLOSE YOUR MOUTH!
So wait…because YOU haven’t been harassed and your FRIENDS haven’t been harassed (thank goodness) this means that he didn’t do it to anyone?  Your logic is flawed.  Let me make this simple.  THE OED SUBSTANTIATED THE CLAIMS!!!  The OED ruled against him, all the faculty and doctoral students want him gone…but you Sarah know better than everyone.  
Let me give you some advice as you sound really young and just starting in your career as a student; Be careful who you side with.  Be careful how you present yourself on public forums.  You never know who is reading this and how they may take your statements.  Below is a link to a letter just published by the faculty of the school of social work.  I implore you to read it and really think about what is being said in the document.  Then if you are feeling bold look at the signatures on the bottom of the letter and decide if all those names mean something to you, to your future.  Are they all wrong too?
You mean the Office of Equity and Diversity? They have as much legal credibility as an organized crime syndicate.
So Michael since you feel they have no credibility wouldn’t you think they would side with their faculty as to avoid suit and protected their interests including lots of funding brought to the school by Dr. Guerrero?  What are you trying to say?  Or are you just interested in trying to make nonsensical inflammatory statements.  I believe those people are better known as trolls. Michael are you a troll?
It is clear…Professor Eric Guerrero  is “Michael”, “Sarah H.”, “John Doe”. Sad and pathetic.
It is CLEAR that graduate students of USC also like to harass others, I guess too. Just because you don’t agree with what others have to say doesn’t mean it’s Profrssor Guerrero “hiding behind a screen.” Get a grib you BULLY!
Sarah…you should proofread your comments.  Don’t know what a Profrssor is or how to get a “Grib”.  If you want some help, I’m sure the graduate students could proofread your stuff for you.  Maybe I should paste your comment below for fear you might delete it again…or try and edit it to fix your typos.
Well said.
Your response to Sarah sounds extremely creepy and threatening. No wonder she deleted her message. Are you threatening a woman because she disagrees with you and the money-sucking vampire, Larissa?
That is exactly why I deleted it Michael!! And I actually blocked him too because he was telling me how to act for my future which was totally uncalled for and constantly accusing me of being Professor Guerrero, which is plain wrong. 
They are accusing him of sexual assault yet their threatening nature is bullying and assault at its finest.
Hey everyone look the troll is back!  Another great addition to this conversation.  Thanks Michael for your always intelligent discourse.
What are you implying, Seth? ” Be careful who you side with.  Be careful how you present yourself on
public forums.  You never know who is reading this and how they may take
 your statements.” What are you going to do, thug? Why are you threatening a woman with implicit violence because she disagrees with your money-sucking scheme?
Michael I want to thank you for all the exposure you are giving this important article. The more your type your troll comments the more exposure this article gets. Please continue to share and support this important information.  I know how important it is for you to make sure strong people like Karissa get their voices heard. Thanks.
AGREED.

It seems that many institutions have hidden their unacceptable standards and are now being forced into daylight by such a discovery.  That being said, I am truly dismayed that USC would not have set the example years ago of zero tolerance on the issues of sexual assault.  This student is performing a service for everyone by shining a light on the unthinkable circumstance that a discovered faculty member only has to face a fine and reprimand.  Sexual assault must not be tolerated for anyone in this community; faculty, students, administration and workers.
I earned a MA in Ethics at USC and feel certain this would have been our only topic until it was rectified with a zero tolerance policy.  Time to do better, USC.
That makes no sense, if the school sets that type of policy ANY student then can make claims against their professor and have that professor fired over simple “allegations.” theres no hard evidence against him, no proof of sexual relations, nothing. You are making him out to be a predator when you are a stranger and no nothing about what’s happened on the inside and what we are dealing with as students at the school. Please go away and use your words correctly! 
If a student gets a grade they aren’t happy with, they can then make claims against the professor that he or she sexually harassed them and then get that professor fired because of the “zero tolerance” policy. LISTEN to your words. There are people who will always try to take advantage of the system. The school is doing the best they can to deal with this to not harm either parties until it is decided fairly.
Shame on USC for minimizing Dr. Guerrero’s disturbing and dangerous act of sexual violence. I stand beside Karissa and Student X as well as other students on our campus who have been and are currently victims of sexual violence.  This behavior is unacceptable!
You clearly know nothing about her and are a cowardly pathetic troll, who can’t even come up with a better screenname to hide behind.
You are a naive and fanatical troll who knows nothing about the inner workings of USC’s Title IX process and the ideological madness behind these witch hunts. Have you ever seen a female professor or administrator punished for ANYTHING? And in case you missed the memo, Karissa is suing the school and the professor for MONEY.
The one transparent thing about this whole process is who is posting as John Doe. An army stands behind Karissa because we are so fortunate to know and love her.
Yes, I am aware an “army” is standing behind her. That’s the point. I believe the technically correct term is “mob,” though. You know what Ibsen said about moralizing zealots like you. “A minority may be right, but the majority is always wrong.” You are wrong.
#iamstudentX
I STAND WITH DR. Erick Guerrero!!!
This is Karissa’s money
Everyone needs to calm down. Nothing’s been proven yet. There are also many faculty and students at the school who support and admire Dr. Guerrero and believe in him. Go read the court documents. It’s clear she had some sort of crush on him and was devastated when she found out his wife was pregnant. You need to stop treating him like he is a “sexual predator” when nothing’s been decided. CALM DOWN AND RESPECT THE ETHICAL CODE.
Dr. Guerrero…I mean John Doe….Come out of the shadows and show your true self.
If he mentioned his real name your “army” would go after him. BULLIES!!!!!
I stand with Karissa, ‘Student X,’ and anyone else who has experienced this at the hands of predators like Dr. Guerrero.  I feel sorry for his wife and child who are also victims in this.  Dean Flynn and President Nikas need to sober up and realize that they have aided in the continuation and creation of a toxic misogynistic culture at USC.  They can fix this and the first step is the dismissal of predators like Dr. Guerrero, no matter how much NIH grant monies they bring to USC.
You feel sorry for his wife and child?? If you did you would not ask for his dismissal. His wife is supporting him through this process. It’s clear you are a stranger and KNOW nothing about what is going on in the inside. Take your negative comments elsewhere instead of trying to ruin someone’s life over false allegations made against him. I am one of his female students and have NEVER seen anything wrong on his part or unfair treatment of females. Do not try to act moral when your comments state otherwise.
Karissa is such a strong and brave person for speaking out!  She is standing up for not only herself but for other students who otherwise would be vulnerable to his predatory and reprehensible behavior! #StandWithKarissa
#StandWithKarissa!
#IamStudentX
The school needs to step up and meet its obligation to make its students feel safe. No one is deserving of sexual harassment and everyone should be safe, secure, and supported in the environment where they learn or work. The punishment does not fit the crime the university itself found him guilty of. I stand in solidarity with Karissa, other surivivors, and the coalitation, Social Workers to End Rape Culture.
so i suppose the million she is asking for will make her feel a little safer
Virtue signalling and mob lynching. *Yawn*
This is not right. I am currently a second year graduate student at this school. This goes against our values as Social Workers. I stand with Karrisa,  “Victim X” , and anyone else that Guerrero has wronged. We need answers yesterday.
I stand unequivocally with all survivors. Karissa, I thank you so deeply for starting the steps toward BIG change that will see so many people protected.
Solidarity with Karissa! I am a current MSW 2nd year student and am shocked by Dean Flynn and the school’s lack of transparency and accountability on this issue. We all deserve a safe learning environment. Allowing someone accused of such serious allegations to continue teaching students is unacceptable!
Yeah, “such serious allegations.” Apparently he danced on a table. DANCED ON A TABLE, YOU SAY? BURN THE WITCH!
Happy to see he has the support of his wife, it shows what an honest man he is!

Many students made handwritten thank-you cards and passed them out to safety workers and DPS officers on and around campus. Photo by Wanting He | Daily Trojan
Interaction with USC’s safety workers is part of daily life for students: From scanning into University dorms to showing ID cards to “yellow jacket” security ambassadors after curfew, these individuals are an integral part of the USC experience. 
USC’s Explore Kindness club hosted Safety Worker Appreciation Day on Thursday night to encourage students to take a moment and have a conversation with security workers they see on a daily basis. Students could also provide them with snacks or thank-you cards as tokens of appreciation. 
“[What] I’m hoping for is that all the safety workers here, especially the ones that are here late at night for us, that they just feel like they are appreciated by our community, because they are the protection for our community,” said Explore Kindness co-president Evelina Godecki, a junior majoring in business administration. “I just want them to have a smile on their face and feel like what [they’re] doing is impactful.”
While the event was based on encouraging individual actions from students to demonstrate their appreciation, Explore Kindness met on Trousdale Parkway at around 9 p.m. to provide supplies students can pass out. 
The club provided snacks and candy, as well as supplies to create thank-you cards. 
Nancy Huang, a sophomore majoring in business administration, participated in the event by making and giving thank you cards to the security officers she often sees around campus. 
“These workers keep us safe every day — it’s the least we can do to thank them,” Huang said. “You can walk around on campus and feel totally fine, that’s because of the workers.”
Beyond having safety workers feel appreciated on Thursday, Godecki hopes the event makes students more aware of safety workers to increase personal interaction throughout the year.
“I hope that this will end up sparking the interest in doing it a little bit more,” Godecki said. “I remember last semester, there was a yellow jacket right outside of my building that I would always say ‘Hi’ to. I would always pass and she would ask how my day was, and I would ask her the same.” 
Godecki said she never exchanged names with the safety worker, but they always recognized each other when they passed. She hopes the event will encourage students to build a connection with the workers and become more familiar with them. 
The Explore Kindness club is a USC chapter of a nonprofit organization of the same name, dedicated to making the world a better place through random acts of kindness, according to its website. 
The USC chapter does campaigns throughout the year to brighten people’s days, such as provide coffee for students during move-in day and “Do Something Nice” day, where they hand out written tasks for students to complete on Trousdale Parkway, with each task being a gesture of kindness for the student to do that day. 
This also isn’t the first time Explore Kindness has shown gratitude for safety workers — during Spring 2017, it held a Yellow Jacket Appreciation Day, but event participation was low due to stormy weather, Godecki said. 
“It wasn’t the impact it could’ve been just because of weather reasons,” Godecki said. “So we decided that we wanted to do it again this year, and make it more inclusive, because there are a lot of people keeping us safe at night, so we wanted to include DPS officers, and the people who stay up late to let us into the buildings.”
This event, and Explore Kindness in general, has a simple goal for students at USC.
“We want people to have a little bit more intention with their day,” Godecki said.

Professor Stacey Schepens Niemiec, who created MovingUp, aims to prove that older adults are open to new technology. Photo courtesy of Stacey Schepens Niemiec.
The occupational therapy program at USC is in the process of improving the lives and health of older adults. 
Stacey Schepens Niemiec, assistant professor of research at the Chan Division of Occupational Science and Occupational Therapy, is spearheading the creation process of the MovingUp app, along with a team of health professionals, software engineers and community partners. The app, made possible by a $468,000 grant from the National Institute on Aging, focuses specifically on improving the physical activity of the older adult population.
“I want people to understand that older adults are open to trying technology and using it for their health,” Schepens Niemiec said. “They just need access to it and they need something that is tailored to their specific needs, and that is what we are doing with this grant.”
MovingUp was originally funded by an award from the Rehabilitation Research Career Development program, which was only able to fund the beginnings of the app over the last five years. However, the new grant from the National Institute on Aging will ensure the finalization of three of the five envisioned features of the app within the next two years. 
Schepens Niemiec is an occupational therapist and instructional designer by training, and first came to USC as a postdoctoral fellow. Her research and interests have always concerned technology use in older adults, as well as technology use for health and wellness. 
“There is this trend of using mobile health apps to improve health in generally younger populations,” Schepens Niemiec said. “I saw a gap there in terms of what’s known as the digital divide.”
Schepens Niemiec sees this digital divide as a failure to introduce technology into older adults’ lives. She believes that there are stereotypes instilled in society that the elderly population is averse to using mobile applications as a part of their everyday lives.
The challenge of creating an app has turned out significantly different in practice than the design team had initially envisioned. 
“The development process is so cumbersome and I didn’t know that until I started working on a single app,” Schepens Niemiec said.
Nevertheless, the MovingUp team is making an effort to promote health in a way that has never been done before. The application will be evidence based, which is the first time such a design will be implemented in a wellness app. Due to its design, the development process requires an extensive commitment to beta testing.
“We are doing a little bit of testing with the funds that I have,” Schepens Niemiec said. 
She tested 150 people in getting the self-tracking component up and running, including 50 younger, 50 middle-aged and 50 older adults doing a walking, standing and sitting task.
This progress check feature, as she calls it, is about halfway done at the moment, as are the two other funded features. 
The remaining two features are currently in storyboard development, and their completion will depend on whether additional funding is granted.
neat!

Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
On Monday, Vice President for Student Affairs Ainsley Carry sent out an email memorandum reminding students of their rights and resources regarding campus sexual misconduct. But Carry’s email went beyond reviewing disciplinary policy around sexual violence, and emphasized that every Trojan can and must help prevent cases of sexual assault through bystander intervention.
The memo pointed out several ways that students who witness a situation they’re uncomfortable with can intervene — such as by creating a distraction, talking to the person who may be in trouble, enlisting others to support them and calling an authority. It’s easy to see how these tips can prove useful in social settings where one or both parties are intoxicated or otherwise unable to consent, and a third party may be able to intervene to stop an assault from happening. 
In listing strategies for how to intervene in a number of potentially dangerous situations, Carry sent a clear message that campus sexual assault is not an issue that can be single-handedly dismantled with a couple of policy changes from the administration. When it comes to reform on campus sexual assault, the student body is just as obligated as administrators and Title IX faculty to make USC a safer place.
For administrators, this obligation means not only working to foster an environment in which students feel safe and comfortable reporting their experience and have convenient access to mental health resources, but also ensuring the wide dissemination of preventative education. In an interview with the Daily Trojan last semester, Carry said that his goal is ultimately to “chase zero” reports of sexual assault, not because he wants a campus environment where students do not report their experiences out of fear, but because he’s reaching for one where sexual assault no longer happens. Spreading bystander intervention education is the first step to achieving this goal. 
In both data and experience, this kind of education has proven effective. In May, the University of Kentucky published the results of a study that tracked 26 Kentucky high schools over five years — half of which used a bystander intervention program called Green Dot, and half of which had no bystander education at all. By the third year of the study, rates of reported sexual misconduct were 12 percent lower in schools that used the Green Dot program than those that did not. And in high-profile incidents like the Brock Turner case at Stanford University, bystanders were able to intervene in the middle of a sexual assault and later identify the perpetrator. 
While the move toward bystander education is laudable, one email listing four strategies for intervention is not enough to combat an overarching culture of misinformation, confusion and even complicity in cases of sexual assault on the University’s part. USC must reevaluate its current online training curriculum and consider more engaging strategies that require students to actively pay attention to the material they are learning, and learn and internalize it for more than the few minutes it takes to complete the online courses. To accomplish this goal, the University must collaborate with student organizations, including Greek life and advocacy organizations, to plan and execute more comprehensive material. 
However, on the student body’s part, Trojans must collectively recognize Carry’s latest memo as a call to action. Achieving a campus climate where sexual predation is not tolerated, excused or overlooked necessitates an attitude change within our student body — one in which Trojans recognize that every one of us has a role in ending a systemic problem. And only when we all take these individual roles seriously and fulfill our obligations to our peers can this goal be realized. 
In recent years, USC has hired a Title IX coordinator; actively clarified Title IX policy and strengthened the Title IX office’s web presence; developed task forces in collaboration with student groups; invested more resources into Relationship and Sexual Violence Prevention and Services; and implemented the Violence Outreach Intervention and Community Empowerment program. Safety from sexual violence is required to allow students to thrive in their academics and professional pursuits, and lead mentally and physically healthy lives as college students. Our University has shown that it is determined to do its part, and to learn and grow with its student body to achieve the ever-important goal articulated by Carry as “chasing zero.” 
But the reality is that it is not our senior administrators or Title IX faculty attending Friday night parties, or witnessing the state of our peers as they leave parties with strangers. There is only so much that the University can do to educate students, reform its policies and guarantee access to crucial resources. Real change must ultimately come from the decisions students make in their everyday lives. USC has shown its willingness to educate, and now, students must show their willingness to learn and take action.
Daily Trojan Fall 2017 Editorial Board
Drain the swamp of Title IX parasites! Let the police & courts handle allegations of CRIME.
We need to get the colleges and universities out of the law enforcement business.  They suck at it.  All allegations of sexual assault ought to go directly to the police, just like happens with non-students.  College students are no protected class they neither need nor deserve any special procedures or protections not available to the average citizen.  
Let e police and courts handle it.

Lily Vaughan | Daily Trojan
As the California Senate’s president pro Tempore, Kevin de León sets out to challenge Dianne Feinstein in the 2018 midterm election, he does so guns a-blazing for another ultra-progressive path. He will almost certainly target the young voters traversing California’s college campuses. He will accuse old stick-in-the-mud Feinstein of being a humorless centrist; he will attempt to persuade you that she represents some ethereal “establishment” fighting the wishes of “real Americans,” and hope those dog whistles mean something to you. He will make promises of free college in a time we are fighting tooth and nail to preserve basic health care: While congressional Democrats battle for the nation’s bare necessities, he will launch a deeply ill-considered and unnecessary anti-establishment tirade. He jeopardizes the party, he jeopardizes the future of the country and he sacrifices Democratic solidarity for personal gain.
It’s all good and well to consider the problems inherent in radical progressivism — we’ll get to it. First, prudence demands we take a moment to address the very thing that we’re actually talking about: The U.S. Senate. This election is not simply a referendum on Californian progressivism. This election will deeply affect a tangible governing body responsible for the foreseeable national future. 
We approach de León’s challenge at a time when Democrats are hanging on by slim victories in the protection of former President Barack Obama’s legacy, legislation formative and foundational to the future of American life, as well as seminal protections for vulnerable groups. Senate Democrats are closing ranks and leaning on the full force of their experience and expertise to do so — and succeeding because of the bravery of a few upstanding, principled Republicans. If ever there were a time to dedicate concerted energy to supporting our Democratic senators, it’s now. This is the time to ensure the Democratic Party in the Senate remains as strong as it can possibly be. 
I balk at the thought that we are actually considering replacing a senior Democratic senator who was one of the only two to directly receive former FBI Director James Comey’s intelligence briefing on Russian electoral interference; the ranking member of both the Judiciary and Intelligence committees; a public servant with experience, relationships, networks, expertise and influence in Washington at a time when we need those assets most. 
But she’s old, you might claim. Sure, that’s true. She turned 84 years old this year. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg also happens to be 84. Funny enough, Democrats aren’t calling for her resignation. Shall we ask Ginsburg to step down, too? Someone as weathered as Feinstein has decided to seek re-election when all other signs point to the fact that she has been very willing, and perhaps even waiting, to retire. She has forged a lasting legacy; she is well within her rights to pass the baton. So why forge on — Hubris? Please.
Feinstein is sticking around because she feels she must; it is imperative that California voters come to the same conclusion. To be sure, de León’s track record in the state Senate is admirable; his work on environmental and economic policy is commendable. But there is certainly some degree of ease in passing legislation through a governing body eternally comprised of a blue supermajority. The U.S. Senate, as it stands, is far different. Replacing Feinstein plays into a dangerous game, one in which it seems Republicans are already engaging — the slow and steady replacement of centrists with extremist representatives, the phasing out of moderates to make way for the reactionaries and radicals. 
An ultra-progressive congressional left will not result in free college and universal smiles; it will mean continued gridlock. We can’t demand reasonability from the other party and refuse to offer it ourselves. Into the future, the kicking and screaming of radicals and ultra-progressives is only making it more difficult for Democrats to muster the unified front and single, persuasive message they so desperately need to succeed in 2018 and 2020. Kevin de León did not create this rift; but he seems all too willing to twist the knife for personal political gain, and this time, we simply cannot afford it. 
Don’t sacrifice the party of the people — the party of the working class and the party of the working government, the party of equity and the party of progress, the party of Stronger Together and Yes We Can, the party of John F. Kennedy and Harvey Milk and Ann Richards and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Don’t jeopardize its future to advance Kevin de León’s career. Now is not the time. Reaffirm support for Diane Feinstein. Reaffirm support for a better future and a united front.
Kevin de León, put country before career. Affirm your support for the issues that count, for Obama’s legacy and an equitable, sensible American future. End this petulant challenge honorably. Support Dianne Feinstein. 
Lily Vaughan is a junior majoring in history and political science. Her column,“Playing Politics,” runs Fridays.
It will be interesting to see if de Leon’s open-borders agenda really does resonate will college students.
I think Ms. Vaughan aptly points out the strain radical politics places on basic democratic function. Especially now that liberals have to operate under a radical and incompetent presidency (which extends via careerism to the senate), and are now forced to fight for necessities like healthcare, politicians and students mustn’t continue to operate as if Ms. Clinton had won, placing an ever greater number of progressive politicians onto a platform of democratic support that doesn’t exist. 
To that point, even if someone is radically progressive–and wouldn’t otherwise support a centrist like Feinstein–they should realize that you have to right a ship, before sailing it onward towards utopia; that is, one should fix their progressive subsection of the democratic party by strengthening the political platform of its more established political forbears (i.e. the centrist democrats). Now, I don’t believe that said progressive utopia is possible, but it seems the people who do are essential to the party. So let’s do our best to work together; we can start by following Ms. Vaughan’s advice, and elect leaders who strengthen and promote our shared values, and don’t throw them aside at the sweet, sweet tune of free college tuition–no matter how tempting, especially at USC :)
Also just wanna say that a freshman at USC, this kind of journalism–along with Point/Counterpoint–reflect well on the school as a whole, regardless of somebody’s political leanings… thanks for the hard work.

Those who have seen NBC’s Emmy Award-winning show The Voice know that the singing competition has produced and launched the careers of young music artists across America.
USC’s Karli Webster, a junior majoring in music industry, is currently competing on the show. She has made it through the blind audition and the battle rounds, which aired this week. Webster, a Southern California native, has been singing her entire life and hopes to gain as much experience and knowledge of the industry as she can throughout her journey on The Voice to ultimately become a professional singer/songwriter. 
The Daily Trojan interviewed Webster to learn more about her, as well as her recent experiences on the show. 

Daily Trojan: When did you start singing?
Karli Webster: I have been singing my whole life. My mom says that I was singing before I could talk. My dad was in a few heavy metal bands when I was younger, so I grew up going to his concerts. I always saw him singing, and my mom was always playing ’70s music around the house. I loved singing along with Fleetwood Mac. There’s no part of my life that wasn’t music-centered.
DT: Did you know from a young age that you wanted to make a career out of singing?
KW: Yes, but like every little kid I always wanted to do everything. I wanted to be an ice cream truck driver, a princess and a teacher. Watching my dad on stage is what really pushed me to want to sing. I saw the way that his performances were making people happy and knew that was exactly what I wanted to do. 
DT: Who are some of your biggest musical influences?
KW: I’m named after Carly Simon, so she’s definitely a huge influence on me. My mom is just obsessed with her, so I grew up listening to her music — it was always playing around the house. Stevie Nicks is another [artist] that I really look up to. I’ve been told that there are some similarities in our voices — one of the greatest compliments ever.
DT: Do you write your own music?
KW: I do! The first time I wrote a song was when I was 5 years old. I wrote a song on the piano for a little songwriting competition in my elementary school and I was the only person to put words to my song. It was about courage, which I think is really funny because courage is something I struggled with in music. I’ve been writing music ever since. 
DT: Who else are you listening to right now?
KW: I listen to a lot of singer/songwriter type songs. I like when artists write about their own experiences. 
I listen to a lot of Kevin Parker and Tame Impala, a lot of Father John Misty, Devendra Banhart. My favorite band of all time is Fleet Foxes, and I got to see them live recently. I also love Sufjan Stevens. I think that these artists are not the typical singer-songwriters. They write music that goes a little bit deeper and isn’t like the typical music that comes and goes. The kind of artist that I want to be is one of those timeless artists, like Fleetwood Mac, that have music that you can listen to today and it still be important and current. I think a lot of pop music dies as quickly as it is created. It’s generated from wanting to be controversial, current and political, which causes it to not be current a week later. As a pop singer, I think that is an important thing to avoid doing.
DT: What was the process like in auditioning for The Voice?
KW: It is definitely a lot more hectic than people see. When you watch shows like American Idol and even The X Factor, you see the mile-long lines of people wanting to audition. That’s what The Voice is like, even though you don’t see it on TV. Back in February, I went to the open call in Las Vegas. It was the first time I auditioned for anything, and I swear I had to walk two miles to get to the end of the line. There were so many people, and the weirdest thing is that we all want the same thing. I expected people to be very competitive, but everyone was very supportive. I made a lot of friends at that open call. 
After that, there are about four or five callbacks between the open call and the blind audition. There were 100 of us that they put into hotel for a month, and that’s what you don’t see. We spent an entire month hanging out and working on our blind audition song before anything was taped. A ton of friendships are formed, and the production makes a lot of cuts. Every day, you don’t know if you’re going to be cut. By the time the blind audition came, I was just excited and happy to be there.
DT: Why did you choose to sing “You’re So Vain” at the blind audition?
KW: I picked that song because I am named after Carly Simon, and I wanted the opportunity to make her and my mom proud because she’s been such an influence, musically, on my entire life. There’s no other way I would want to represent myself than with what I was raised on. If I could go back and pick another song, I would still pick “You’re So Vain.”
DT: How were you able to focus on your performance given the pressure?
KW: I did not sleep at all the night before my blind audition — I was too excited. The day of, I was extremely calm, and I can’t explain why. I think it was just because I was grateful to have made it that far. The process is an emotional roller coaster even before the blind audition. 
When I got to the blind audition, I remembered that I spent a month working on this, and I just have to do it and see what happens. I don’t think anything can prepare you for when the coaches are sitting in those chairs. We do rehearsals on that stage to mentally prepare us, but then suddenly, there’s over a hundred people in the studio audience and four of the best musicians in the industry just sitting there. As soon as they turned their chairs, I almost forgot to keep singing.

DT: What was going through your mind when you had to choose between Miley Cyrus and Adam Levine as your coach?
KW: I wanted to go with Miley from the beginning. When I found out that she was going to be a coach this season, it was the deciding factor in me wanting to audition. I am obsessed with her and always have been. I saw her on Season 11 when she was a coach, and saw that she was an amazing coach and person. 
After some of the things Adam said on stage, I almost changed my mind. The show makes a lot of cuts, so I was actually talking to them on stage for about 45 minutes. Miley laid out an entire plan for what she wanted to do with me, and the style of music I wanted to do. I felt like she had a strong sense of the direction I wanted to go in. Adam was showering me with all of these compliments that were amazing to hear, but I loved that Miley got straight to business. She sold me.
DT: What is Miley’s approach to coaching you?
KW: She’s very involved. What you don’t see is that she’s involved to the point of what we wear on stage. She gave each of the battle partners a clothing theme because she wanted us to look and feel cool. She’s very much involved in the entire Voice process, which is different from the other coaches. The other coaches usually show up, coach their team through the songs and go home. Miley is so invested in every one of her artists, and she wants us to be our true selves. Her critiques are all about how to enhance who each individual artist is. 
I was paired with an artist who had a very different voice than mine, and instead of Miley trying to change us to blend together, she told us to do exactly what we would on our own. She gave us moments where we could each shine, and it made our battle the best experience. She makes sure each artist is represented by who they are and want to be, especially since she has that experience of people wanting to change her.
DT: What advice do you have for younger Thornton students or singers attempting to break into the industry?
KW: I don’t have a lot of performance experience, which was different from almost everyone else on the show. Most people had been gigging and had released albums. I think that lack of experience can push a lot of people away, and it can cause people to feel like they are not good enough. My advice, then, would be that experience does not determine someone’s quality of talent. If I had let that get in the way of me believing in myself, then I wouldn’t be where I am now. I would say to anyone, go for what you want even if you don’t have the experience.

Kylie Cheung | Daily Trojan
Living on a college student budget inherently necessitates compromises, which might be just one reason that stores like Forever 21 and Victoria’s Secret are so popular within our age group. And yet an equal-parts heartbreaking and unsettling VICE report on Wednesday dealt a harsh reminder that sometimes, these compromises aren’t worth it.
According to the report, a German documentary looking inside Latin America-based plantations, pig farms and factories used by beloved candy company Haribo found appallingly dangerous and abusive working conditions tantamount to slave labor, as well as rampant animal abuse. It seems like the costs of the company’s low prices are ethical wages and respect for basic human rights, and this certainly isn’t unique to Haribo. 
Just last year, the Los Angeles Times published a report with similar, disturbing revelations about how stores like Forever 21 and Ross produce those alluringly priced $15 jackets and $9 dresses — largely through sweatshop labor practices in factories here in Los Angeles. A 2011 report detailed shameful child labor, among other abuses, within Victoria’s Secret’s India- and Sri Lanka-based factories.
We might all hold certain values and ascribe to certain morals, but to what extent do we have the resources to follow them in our everyday lives? No one is saying that conscious consumerism is easy. Put simply, knowing how to assess a product’s environmental friendliness and being willing to pay more for this, knowing which companies support strong unions and offer fair wages and, again, being willing to pay for this, is a lot. It seems every college student is short of two things: time and money. The unfortunate reality is that an hour spent conducting thorough Google searches for where to get ethically caught fish, a dress made from organic hemp or affordable clothing for which companies don’t exploit children and factory workers is an hour most college students don’t have. 
Art by Shideh Ghandeharizadeh | Daily Trojan
But as for our need for affordable food and clothing, maybe it’s time to rethink our conceptions of “affordable.” For example, a $9 dress that will tear in a month or so might not be the best investment, compared with a one-time $40 buy from a store that uses higher-quality material and offers factory workers decent living conditions and wages. There are economic benefits to shopping ethically and intelligently, and by all means, be motivated by that. But college also marks a time in our lives when we should be looking beyond ourselves, considering the changes we’d like to see in the world and how to be a part of implementing them. 
If you don’t support slave labor and severe human rights violations, then don’t buy products from companies that perpetuate and rely on these abuses. Don’t be fooled into thinking that doing so equates to sitting on a throne of pretentious moral superiority, or that spending more on clothes or food equates to a need to check your privilege. Our beliefs have to be more than beliefs — they have to be tangible actions based in how we treat others, how we spend our money and the companies and entities we lend our support to. It’s not a waste of time, nor is it a waste of money. It’s an investment in the change we want to see in the world — change that we’ll only see if we cease to be complicit in labor exploitation. 
In either case, a healthy starting point could be looking into online listings of which companies support and empower unions, which stand up for workers’ rights, and where to find these companies near you. A visit to www.getunion.com will substantially cut down your time spent doing research, and give you more time to spend ethically shopping. You’ll also likely find a relationship between companies that are interested in preserving the environment and respecting labor rights and higher-quality, more durable products. 
I’m not saying this is the easiest or most economical lifestyle, but change has to start somewhere. Not everyone is going to wind up being a lawyer or policymaker and not everyone’s career is going to be dedicated to fighting for labor rights. But everyone who believes in these values has to fight for them in some way, and for cash-strapped, busy college students, shopping smart is arguably the most convenient.

No. 21 USC may have seen its playoff hopes dashed in a 49-14 meltdown against Notre Dame last week, but the team still has a clear goal in sight. The Trojans control their own destiny in the Pac-12 South with a 4-1 conference record. Standing in the way is a road game against a rising Arizona State team. 
“Looking forward to getting on a plane and going and competing for first place in the Pac-12 South,” head coach Clay Helton said. “It’s [going to] be a great challenge in a great atmosphere against a team that’s playing really good football right now.”
At the very start, Arizona State’s season appeared to be a lost cause. In Week 1, the Sun Devils narrowly escaped with a win over New Mexico State. And in Week 2, they lost to San Diego State by 10 points. Despite its sleepwalk into 2017, Arizona State has finally found its groove with major wins over then-No. 5 Washington and Utah this month. Its resurgence has been due in no small part to major improvements on the defensive side. 
Entering their clash with Washington, the Sun Devils’ defense was porous at best, giving up over 400 total yards in four of five contests to start the season (Stanford’s Heisman hopeful Bryce Love ran for 301 yards against them). Over the past two games though, Arizona State has been allowing just 147 passing yards per game and 100 rushing yards per game. 
“I think they’re doing a tremendous job of playing within the system,” Helton said. “They’ve usually provided a bunch of different looks over the past couple of years. Now they’ve simplified things a little bit for their kids and they’ve gotten better each week.”
Arizona State will be tasked with defending a USC offense that remains without an identity eight weeks into the season. Much has been said about redshirt sophomore quarterback Sam Darnold’s turnover-prone play this season — he’s responsible for 17 of the team’s 19 turnovers — but the unit has also been hampered by an uneven running game. Early on, the duo of junior Ronald Jones II and freshman Stephen Carr seemed unstoppable, combining for 463 yards in the first two games. 
However, during Carr’s extended absence dating back to the Washington State game, the running attack has been lackluster. Against Notre Dame, Jones was bottled up for 32 yards on 12 carries and the Trojans were forced into one-dimensional play behind the shaky offensive line. USC hopes to re-establish the ground game and take some pressure off Darnold in a tough road environment. 
Carr is likely to remain out for the fourth game in a row against Arizona State, but he’s hardly the only injury-related absence USC will have to cope with this weekend. On Thursday, head coach Clay Helton offered an unfortunate update on sophomore defensive lineman Christian Rector, who injured his hand during Wednesday’s practice. 
“He suffered a broken hand and will require surgery,” Helton said. “From that point he’s probably weeks out [from a return]. We’ll see how that goes after the surgery.” 
While filling in for junior linebacker Porter Gustin since the Texas game, Rector has turned into a star, as he is currently leading the Pac-12 with 6.5 sacks. Now it is uncertain if he will able play another game in his breakout season, handing the Trojans yet another devastating injury. Also on the defensive side, junior nose tackle Josh Fatu (concussion) and junior outside linebacker Gustin (broken toe and bicep) are game-time decisions for Saturday after seeing limited practice reps this week. 
“Right now with injuries and no bye week … it’s time to protect bodies,” Helton said. “We’re one or two injuries away from being really limited.” 
With a depleted defensive front, defending Arizona State’s senior running back duo of Demario Richard and Kalen Ballege could be a challenge. Last week, USC’s front seven was trampled by that of Notre Dame, which ran wild for 377 yards and five touchdowns. Neither Richard nor Ballege is of the same caliber as the Irish’s Josh Adams, but both are experienced and powerful backs. Against Utah, the two ran for 168 yards in the Sun Devils’ physical 30-10 win. 
Joining Richard and Ballege on offense is Manny Wikins at quarterback. The signal caller from Novato, Calif. has cut down on mistakes (only three interceptions this year) while increasing productivity (262.4 yards per game) during his junior year. Meanwhile, 6-foot-4 wide receiver N’Keal Harry has emerged as his favorite target, averaging 89.6 yards per game. 
As USC finishes out its conference schedule, the road to the Pac-12 Championship will go through Tempe, Ariz. as both teams seek to punch their ticket to the championship game at Levi’s Stadium in December.

Former USC football coach Steve Sarkisian’s lawsuit against the University was dismissed by a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge on Tuesday. Both parties will continue to seek arbitration independently. 
The University and Sarkisian had previously agreed to settle with arbitration in March 2016, but the dismissal will keep both parties from having to check in periodically with a court. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Doyle said that, since most arbitration cases don’t make their way back into court, the dismissal will save both legal fees.
“These arbitration cases go on forever,” Doyle said in an interview with My News LA. “They last longer than Superior Court cases frequently.”
Sarkisian sued the University for breach of contract, discrimination based on disability, failure to accommodate for a disability and retaliation in December 2015. In the suit, Sarkisian claimed that former Athletic Director Pat Haden didn’t allow him to seek proper treatment for his alcoholism before firing him from his position as head coach midseason. 
He claimed he was owed at least $12.6 million for both his coaching contract and a marketing agreement through the University. Carol Mauch Amir, the general counsel for the University, claimed that the suit was packed with “half truths” and “outright falsehoods,” according to the LA Times.
Sarkisian was fired in October 2015 after appearing to be under the influence at the football team’s annual kickoff event. He later released an apology, including an explanation that he had reacted poorly to a mix of medication and alcohol. In his apology, he also asked his team to give him the punishments he would level on his players in a similar situation: doing a set of up-downs.
But several weeks later, Sarkisian was put on a leave of absence after being accused of coaching while under the influence. He was fired on Oct. 12 and checked into treatment, while current head coach Clay Helton stepped into his position on an interim basis. 
Since his firing, Sarkisian joined the Alabama football program as an offensive coordinator ahead of the 2017 national championship, then left to become the offensive coordinator for the Atlanta Falcons.
I’m glad to hear this news, though USC AD Pat haden and USC President Max Nikias did not handle this situation with the style, class and grace that is commensurate of top-notch universities.

The No. 5 women’s soccer team defeated No. 16 Cal 1-0 on Thursday afternoon at home, extending its Pac-12 winning streak to eight games. 
Sophomore midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre scored early in the second half as the Trojans (14-1-1) shut out the Bears.
USC started strong, keeping possession throughout the opening minutes of the game. The first shot came for the Trojans in the fifth minute, when freshman midfielder Savannah DeMelo chopped a shot wide left.  The play resulted in a chance for senior midfielder Nicole Molen, with her header wide as well.    
The next golden opportunity came for the Trojans in the seventh minute with junior midfielder Leah Pruitt and senior forward Alex Anthony hooking up on a nice combination play, with Pruitt getting a shot on goal, but the effort was saved by the goalkeeper. 
Another chance occurred in the 17th minute when a strong run on the right wing of the field by Pruitt resulted in a cross into the penalty box, with the following shot by DeMelo wide right of the goal, with the cross a little behind her when she took her shot.
USC prevented leading Cal goal scorer sophomore striker Abi Kim from having much time on the ball early in the game, only allowing her touches in the midfield, far from the penalty box. 
Cal’s best chance of the first half came in the 40th minute with a cross from redshirt senior midfielder Kelly Fitzgerald from the right wing to sophomore forward Maggie Bell, with the shot over the crossbar. 
At the end of the first half, USC led in shots 13-3 (5-1 on target), but was not able to make any change on the scoreboard. 
Head coach Keidane McAlpine suggested at halftime that in order to start applying more pressure on the Cal defense, USC needed to “be a little more composed around the box and take some chances” and “take risks from distance and see what happens.”
USC started the second half as it did the first, with Pruitt applying immediate pressure from the right wing. 
USC opened the scoring in the 53rd minute with a beautiful shot from sophomore midfielder Ashleigh Plumptre from outside the box — just what McAlpine wanted to happen in the second half — beating the goalkeeper to the roof of the net.  With that goal, Cal’s 517-minute shutout streak came to an end. 
An excellent chance came for Cal in the 85th minute from sophomore midfielder Mia Corbin, with her shot rattling the crossbar.
The Trojans ended the game outshooting the Bears 21-10 (5-1 on target), and keeping another clean sheet and putting in a solid performance.
USC will return on Sunday afternoon, hosting No. 1 Stanford.
