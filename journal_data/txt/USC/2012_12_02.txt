The USC women’s basketball team went on the road for the second time this week and suffered its biggest loss of the season, an 80-46 defeat by San Diego State on Friday.

Junior forward Cassie Harberts led the Women of Troy (3-3) with 15 points, five rebounds and three blocks. Sophomore guard Ariya Crook added 11 points for USC, which had no other player score more than four points.
Guard Courtney Clements led the Aztecs (4-2) with a season-high 25 points and grabbed six rebounds, while guard Chelsea Hopkins finished with 13 points, seven rebounds and five assists.
The game started out close, with the Aztecs leading 23-16 with 8:28 left in the first half. USC would take advantage of opportunities generated by offensive rebounds, cutting the score to 23-20 thanks to consecutive layups by freshman guard Brianna Barrett and senior forward Christina Marinacci. After the last media timeout of the first half, the Aztecs went on a 15-4 run, which included three 3-pointers, putting San Diego State up 38-24 at the half.
“We aren’t a tournament team as of right now and we’re trying to be that tournament team,” co-captain Marinacci said last week. “When we play teams that played in the NCAA tournament, it’s gonna be really important for us to get those wins.”
Harberts led USC with nine points at the half, while freshman guard Jordan Adams had three rebounds. USC shot 30 percent from the field in the half compared to the Aztecs’ 43 percent.
San Diego State continued its hot shooting to start the second half, going on a 5-0 run to extend their lead to 19. After back-to-back jumpers from Harberts and Crook brought the score to 43-28, the Aztecs went on a 13-4 run to jump out to a 56-33 lead. The Aztecs would shoot 50 percent from the field in the second half, including 3-for-5 from behind the arc, and jump out to a 34-point lead, their biggest of the game, with 49 seconds to go. The Women of Troy shot 35 percent in the second half, while making the only 3-pointer attempted in the half.
USC committed only 13 turnovers for the second straight game but was unable to overcome shooting 32 percent from the field, including 2 for 11 from behind the arc. The Aztecs shot 46 percent from the field and 38 percent from behind the arc, committing only eight turnovers. San Diego State also out-rebounded the Women of Troy 48-29 (19-10 on the offensive boards), marking the first time USC has been out-rebounded by an opponent all season. Both teams committed at least 14 fouls, with the Women of Troy shooting 8 of 12 from the free-throw line while the Aztecs shot 10 for 18.
“Right now, it’s about this year and this group,” said USC associate coach Daron Park last week prior to the contest. “Our team is certainly different from the one last year. San Diego State is certainly different from the one last year also. It’s a great early-season test. We love playing great non-conference opponents.”
Redshirt freshman forward Deanna Calhoun and sophomore guard Rachel Totten played their first minutes for USC in the loss. Calhoun picked up three fouls in seven minutes and Totten grabbed a rebound in three minutes. Neither player scored any points.
USC looks to bounce back on the road against Fresno State (3-2) on Wednesday at 7 p.m. They will then return to the Galen Center on Dec. 15 at noon against Texas A&M (3-3).
This program is going nowhere fast with the coaching staff on hand. The same story the last few years even with
two new assistants brought on board for this season. Recruiting has been disappointing to say the least.
Attendance is for the most part pitiful with students really non-existent at the games. Time for Mr. Haden to get
serious and make the changes needed to make this woman sport competitive and attractive to watch.

The USC women’s volleyball team defeated St. Mary’s with a three-set sweep (28-26, 25-16, 25-19) in the second round of the NCAA championships, were hosted at the Galen Center on Saturday night.
Killer · Junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard had six kills against St. Mary’s College. The team now awaits its next playoff matchup. – Joseph Chen | Daily Trojan
Senior opposite hitter Katie Fuller had a team-high 15 kills while freshman outside hitter Samantha Bricio double-doubled with 14 kills and a game-high 12 digs to help power the Women of Troy to victory.
“I’m very happy with the win. I thought this was a hard test for us, and I’m glad we accepted the challenge and I think we got better for it,” USC coach Mick Haley said after the game.
Junior middle blocker Alexis Olgard had a solid match as well, notching six solo blocks along with four blocking assists and helped shut down a strong St. Mary’s attack.
“We did a good job putting a lot of pressure on [Gaels outside hitter Kristina] Graven and making it difficult for her,” Haley said. “Graven has been their bread-and-butter player and we felt having Fuller and Olgard on her was our best chance to win.”
The first set had all the makings of an NCAA tournament game as Saint Mary’s gave the Women of Troy all they could handle in the first set. USC took the Gaels’ best punches with middle blocker Gabby Jolly (nine kills) and outside hitter Jordan Shaw, who had three of her seven kills during the game’s final 10 points, leading the way.
Pac-12 Freshman of the Year Bricio matched Shaw in kills during the same period, and Olgard supplemented her offense with three blocks in the set, one of which being the game-winner.
St. Mary’s started the set by keeping USC on its toes. Fuller was hot early on in the set and finished with seven kills. Long rallies were the theme of the first set with momentum swinging back and forth throughout.
“Early on it was our defense figuring out their offense and what we do as a team to help out our defense is to play well at the net,” Fuller said about the first set. “We had zero [hitting] errors in the first set and that really helped us.”
USC came out strong in the next set, as they never trailing in the 25-16 win. The middle position carried the Women of Troy in this game, with freshman blocker Alicia Ogoms getting involved early with back-to-back kills and Olgard continuing her dominant defensive performance with two blocks and another two blocking assists.
USC’s wall in the middle of the net created problems for St. Mary’s, particularly the Shaw-Jolly combo that combined for only four kills in the set. After notching 24 kills as a team in the first set, the Gaels registered just nine in the second.
St. Mary’s tried to keep it close, but USC ripped off a four-point stretch that saw its lead balloon to 14-10 behind two kills from junior outside hitter Sara Shaw and 1.5 blocks from Olgard — and the squad never looked back.
The third and final set proved to be the least competitive of any of the sets, with USC winning handily 25-19. Once again, the combination of Olgard’s blocking and Fuller’s attacking proved to be too much to handle for the Gaels.
Moving forward, the Women of Troy will head to Texas, where they sport a 10-1 record in NCAA tournament games in the state. Their next opponent has yet to be announced.
The next opponent is Wichita St. who upset Kansas the #11 seed. Better yet the ‘ruins were knocked off
by Michigan St. at Pauley to stay home and watch the WOT move on to the sweet sixteen. The team has
to play better now that it is away from home court.

Conference championship Saturday has come and gone. The BCS selection show came and went. What did both of these television programs have in common?
Neither of them involved USC.
If you had told me when the season began that USC would be playing Georgia Tech in a bowl game, I’d have guessed the Trojans got a BCS at-large bid to the Fiesta Bowl or the Orange Bowl and that Georgia Tech had a breakout season.
The Sun Bowl? Against a 6-7 Yellow Jackets squad that had to petition for bowl eligibility?
It’s not exactly what anyone expected.
No, everyone in this area of Los Angeles had dreams of flying to Miami or, at the very least, playing in the Rose Bowl with the hometown fans yelling at the top of their lungs.
But it was not to be.
For a number of reasons, including but not limited to poor defensive lapses, inopportune turnovers and a tough schedule, the Trojans limped to a 7-5 season. It has been a year where many, including myself, have asked, “How could a team this talented fall flat on its face?” In fact, I’m still wondering.
But when all is said and done and the Trojans take the field in El Paso, Texas, I can honestly say the season won’t have been a waste. Disappointing? Absolutely. I thought this team would finish 11-1 or 10-2 at the worst. I’m not much of a flyer, either, so flying out to Texas isn’t really my idea of a vacation, to be honest.
Given USC is coming off sanctions that prohibited them from going to a bowl during the last two seasons, going to the Sun Bowl isn’t so bad. For the first time since 2009, senior quarterback Matt Barkley gets to play a game after the first week of December. Sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee can add to his incredible receiving totals and dazzle us with more highlight reel plays.
But more importantly, USC is once again relevant. Some schools dream of going to a bowl game — any bowl game. I watched Pittsburgh take on South Florida yesterday, in a game where Pitt was fighting for that elusive sixth win. I’m sure Auburn, who won the national title in 2010 and went 3-9 this season, would have given anything to go to a bowl game. Schools like Kent State haven’t been to a bowl game since the 1970s.
I know USC fans are upset, but in the grand scheme of things, the fact the Trojans are even playing in the postseason is wonderful, especially given the NCAA penalties that have made it tough to practice and put together a deep roster. Things looked oh-so-dark for what seemed like an eternity. Would USC ever be eligible? It seemed like it would be decades until the 2012 season came.
Now we’re here. And after two years that saw fans agonize during bowl week and cheer vicariously through other teams, a berth in the Sun Bowl is pretty darn good. It’s something. It’s what USC fans have wanted for two years, even if they didn’t know it.
Last season, USC’s 10-2 record got them nowhere (except a lot of preseason hype and All-American honors). Everyone wondered how good the team actually was. Could they compete with Alabama? With LSU?
We never found out.
This team went 7-5. We know how good this USC team is: It is good enough to play in a mid-level bowl game. There will be no more questions; 2012 USC is good enough to play in the postseason in a non-BCS game. And that’s OK.
Playing in a bowl game is a privilege many teams have never experienced and might not for many years. As students, we rightly or wrongly expect the squad to walk into the Rose Bowl every New Year’s day and take on a Big Ten team. But it doesn’t really work like that, does it?
There can only be one national champion and one national championship game. There are 34 bowl games. Does that mean the other 33 bowls are worthless? Absolutely not. Only one team gets to hoist a crystal trophy, after all. But bowl season gets teams motivated. It allows fans one more chance to put on their school colors and cheer (or heckle).
It’s upsetting to many that it isn’t USC that will be holding the trophy. But given where USC has been in the last few years, any bowl game is a welcome sight. It will be welcomed. The players will be excited. People will surely watch. Barkley will likely get his swan song.
Surely, there will be “what ifs” about the 2012 Trojans. There were a lot of games that ended so closely. They could have beaten Stanford or Arizona or even Notre Dame. But they didn’t. And USC’s record and bowl game indicate this.
We have closure. We know exactly where USC stands. They will be playing in the Sun Bowl. And if you ask me, there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s the postseason, after all.
 
“Goal Line Stand” ran Mondays. If you would like to comment on this story, visit DailyTrojan.com or email Michael at katzml@usc.edu.
Since when did we lower our standards to the likes o Aurburn? USC is expected to be number 1 every year whether that is realistic or not. Winning the pac ten every year was a consolation prize if it meant not playing for the national championship. To this day we can technically say that USC has zero pac-12 titles. 
Expectations and where you finished compared to those expectations matter. This was the year where SC was supposed to come out of the bowl ban with a bang and show up the NCAA for an unjust punishment. This was the year where Matt Barkely’s patience should have been rewarded. What makes this even worse is the fact that Jim Mora has something legitimate over in Westwood. 
You are right that a Sun Bowl is something but The returning players need to show that they are ready for a title run next year; maybe a 50-0 win and then we can say this season was something.
Yay mediocrity? Our program is far above the programs you mentioned – let’s not lose sight of this. This team is the largest underachiever this year, and the amount of underachieving here may even be historic.
Though, to be fair, none of the bowl matchups this year seem even remotely interesting.
The only good thing about this Bowl is the team gets the allotted time to practice especially for the players
returning next season. We all know what happened the last time the Trojans played in the Sun Bowl with
losing and the program went downhill for the next two years getting the coach fired. What’s the incentive
after facing Oregon, ucla, and Notre Dame which were all bowl games themselves in reality in the month
of November in L.A.?

USC will be spending New Year’s Eve in El Paso, Texas.
On Sunday, the Trojans (7-5, 5-4) accepted a bid to the Sun Bowl as the representative of the Pac-12 against Georgia Tech of the ACC. The Yellow Jackets, who finished 6-7 on the season following Saturday’s 21-15 loss to Florida State in the ACC championship game, were granted a waiver by the NCAA to obtain bowl eligibility despite finishing under .500.
“After not being in a bowl the past two years, we look forward to playing in a bowl with the tradition of the Sun Bowl,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said in a statement. “Georgia Tech is a very well-coached team and will present a challenge on both sides of the ball, especially with their great ability to run the ball.”
Beginning in 1935, the Sun Bowl stands as the nation’s second-oldest bowl game behind the Rose Bowl and is held annually on Dec. 31, typically pitting teams from the Pac-12 and ACC.
Because of NCAA sanctions that included a two-year postseason ban, this marks the Trojans’ first bowl appearance since the 2009 season, when they defeated Boston College 24-13 in the Emerald Bowl.
USC has played in the Sun Bowl on two occasions, first in 1990 when USC lost to Michigan State 17-16 and most recently in 1998, when the Trojans lost 28-19 to TCU during then-coach Paul Hackett’s first season with the program.
The Yellow Jackets and the Trojans will meet for the first time since 1973. Once the Associated Press’ preseason No. 1 team, USC stumbled five times in 2012, including three times in its final four games and losses to rivals UCLA and Notre Dame.
“Although our season didn’t go as well as we hoped, we appreciate the opportunity we now have to play another game and attempt to go out on a winning note,” Kiffin said.
Kiffin also said Sunday night that he anticipates senior quarterback Matt Barkley, who missed the regular season finale against the Fighting Irish, will play in the game.
Kickoff is scheduled for 11 a.m. and will be televised by CBS.
Looking forward to Matt Barkley playing his last game at USC after everything he has done for the school, and ending this season on a winning note. Next year will go a lot better with a deeper OL, more aggressive defense, and less injured players (hopefully).

It’s that time of year again: ring-fitting season for the USC men’s water polo squad.  The No. 1 USC squad (29-0) danced on the edge of defeat the entire match, but scored when it mattered most, using a last-minute strike to defeat No. 2 UCLA (28-5) 11-10 for a record fifth-consecutive NCAA title.
Champions · The USC men’s water polo team won its fifth-straight national championship by defeating UCLA 11-10 on Sunday afternoon. The Trojans finished the season 29-0, the second undefeated season in school history. – Sean Roth | Daily Trojan
After being tied or trailing the entire second half, sophomore driver Kostas Genidounias scored a play called “Candy,” wriggling himself free from his defender and rocketing the title-clinching goal past UCLA goalie Matt Rapacz with 40 seconds remaining. The Trojans forced a UCLA turnover on the Bruins’ final possession, played keep-away for approximately 15 seconds with the ball and then celebrated.
“Kostas is the man,” said senior two-meter Matt Burton. “That kid doesn’t feel pressure, he lives for that moment.”
The play was actually called by senior driver Tobias Preuss, and not coach Jovan Vavic.
“What a game … what a game,” Vavic said. “They [UCLA] executed really well, but our guys have been there before. They [USC] know how to win, and they have a great heart. When we needed to stop [UCLA] at the end of the game, we did.”
Due to  his play in the final two games, senior driver Michael Rosenthal was named NCAA Tournament Most Valuable Player, especially after scoring two clutch goals in the final period.
“I can’t believe it, honestly,” said Rosenthal on going five-for-five on national titles during his time as a Trojan. “I wanted to come to ‘SC to see how I could get at water polo, and the decision to stay for this fifth year  — and oh boy, best decision I ever made.”
Junior driver Nikola Vavic and Genidounias were also named first Team All-Tournament, while Preuss, junior utility Mace Rapsey, and junior goalie James Clark were named to the second Team. The Trojans tied their season worst with ten goals allowed, but only two of those came in the second half, where Clark shined the most.
A sold-out crowd at McDonald’s Swim Stadium made for an atmosphere worthy of a title match, and the squads did not disappoint.
Junior two-meter Connor Virjee whipped a hard shot past UCLA goalie Matt Rapacz on the Trojans’ first possession to start the Trojans off right, but UCLA’s Bret Lathrope answered a minute and a half later to even the score early.
After UCLA swatted away a Rex Butler shot on the Trojans’ 6-on-5, the Bruins’ Danny McClintick rocked a long-distance shot past USC goalie James Clark to give the Bruins a 2-1 lead.
A defensive lapse left UCLA’s Chris Fahlsing open three possessions later, and a lob shot by Paul Reynolds soon after put the Trojans in unfamiliar territory, trailing 4-1. UCLA set the tone with their physical playing style, and things almost got ugly when Preuss had his nose bloodied, then got in a scrum with Rapacz after a missed USC shot. The Trojans allowed just under six goals per game in the regular season, but let in five in just the first period and trailed 5-3 at the end of the first frame.
USC capitalized on a 6-on-4 advantage at the 6:17 mark of the second period with a Michael Rosenthal strike, then Nikola Vavic found the goal with one of his signature upper-corner strikes on the next possession to tie the match at 5 apiece. Blood wiped from his face, Preuss rocketed another shot in to give the Trojans three goals in three possessions and a 6-5 lead, and UCLA’s early three-goal lead was gone.
Their confidence however, was not. The Bruins found their offensive rhythm back and railed off three goals in a row of their own. A testy second period that saw both squad’s head coaches receive yellow cards ended with USC trailing 8-6.
Once again, USC scored on its first possession of the half, on a corner shot from Rosenthal to cut the deficit to one. A third period full of fouls but much-improved defense ended at 9-8 after USC responded to a UCLA goal by finding Mace Rapsey for a close-range strike thanks to some pinpoint passing.
The championship atmosphere was palpable in the final period, as both sides’ defenses stepped up to the occasion. Rosenthal found Burton with a lob pass early in the period, and Burton slammed it home to even the match at nine until UCLA’s Josh Samuels found the back of USC’s net with 3:09 left.
What happened next was a controversial call that nearly had UCLA screaming foul. A USC pass went out toward the out-of-bounds rope, but stopped moving before it hit the rope and thus stayed in-bounds. USC recovered the ball, and Rosenthal completed his hat trick to tie the match at 10.
A shot by Rosenthal narrowly hit the bar and skipped out on USC’s next possession but James Clark slapped away a UCLA shot on the counter.
The Bruins’ Josh Samuels and Daniel Lenhart both missed open, but long-range shots, with Lenhart’s strike skipping over the ball with 46 seconds remaining, setting up Genidounias’s title-winning shot.
“This one is really going to hurt,” UCLA coach Adam Wright said. “We were in a great situation, up one with three minutes left. Give credit to [USC]: they won, [and] five times is something tough to do.
This is the second undefeated season in program history for the Trojans and is Jovan Vavic’s eleventh NCAA title, his eighth for a men’s team.
As a parent of a USC water polo player, I hope I speak for all the parents of these wonderful athletes when I share how proud we are of these hard-working, supportive, team-oriented young men.  They truly deserved this victory in every way.  And we are especially impressed with Matt Burton, Michael Rosenthal and Andrew Reego, who are the first players in history to win five rings in a row.
JOVAN IS THE MAN!!!

El Centro Chicano celebrated its 40th anniversary Saturday with food, music, dancing and awards.
Celebration · Bandmembers of Las Cafeteras entertained the 380 guests who attended El Centro Chicano’s 40th anniversary dinner at Town & Gown on Saturday. The festivities also included dance, speeches and awards. – Alex Rose | Daily Trojan
Three-hundred and eighty students, alumni, parents, faculty and administrators descended on Town and Gown to honor the cultural center’s continued support of Latino and Latina students at USC. El Centro Chicano Director William N. Vela emphasized that running El Centro, which oversees more than 20 programs and organizations, is a team effort.
“Without everyone, we wouldn’t have this,” Vela said. “It sounds like words, but it isn’t. It’s from the heart.”
Darline Robles, a professor of clinical education at USC and former superintendent of the Los Angeles County Office of Education, spoke about her experiences at USC and the need to ensure college educations for Latinos.
“If you do what’s right for our community, it’s right for the broader community,” Robles said. “El Centro fulfills this vision.”
This vision stands crucial to campus, said Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Jackson, who oversees USC’s cultural centers.
“El Centro Chicano has played a key role in welcoming and, more importantly, helping young men and women find their way in this institution so they can go and find their dreams in society,” Jackson said. “El Centro is crucial to diversity and culture at USC. For years, the Trojan Family meant certain families — now it means all families.”
This resonated with John Rodriguez, vice president of the Latino Parent Association for 2011-12, who became involved in the LPA to encourage parents to be involved.
“My son is the first to graduate from college,” Rodriguez said.  “In the LPA, the first meeting that I went to showed me that my student is a Trojan, so I’m a Trojan, too.”
This sense of family has been consistent as long as El Centro has been on campus. 1987 alumna Reyna Corral said that as a first-generation Latina student in the 1980s, when about five percent of students were Latinos, she felt a little isolated until she arrived at El Centro.
“It was really a home away from home,” Corral said. “It was a place to go and be around people like me where I could be comfortable.”
Fatima Djelmane, associate director for Proyecto Pastoral and an ’01 alumna, said she remembers being invited to visit El Centro while living in Parkside as a freshman.
“I felt alone despite the fact that my mom was a Trojan. I had that support, but I still felt culture shock,” Djelmane said. “El Centro changed my path at USC by ensuring I had the support and community to make it.”
This rings true for current students such as Darlyn Zenteno Aguilar, a sophomore majoring in math and psychology, who said living on the El Centro-sponsored Latino Floor helped her get acclimated to campus.
“For me it was special to make these lifelong friends on the Latino floor,” Aguilar said. “As a freshman, you’re new, but with El Centro Chicano, you feel at home at USC faster.”
Rubi Garcia, a sophomore majoring in American studies, said meeting alumni through El Centro’s programs motivates and inspires her.
“You meet people who have started out the same way you did and you see what they’ve done,” she said. “It inspires you to get involved and make the most of your time at USC.”

Today marks the beginning of donation week for Swipes for the Homeless, a USC student group that donates students’ extra dining dollars to the Los Angeles Mission, a non-profit organization that serves the homeless in the L.A. area.
Swipes for the Homeless was founded at UCLA in 2009 and has extended to 10 university campuses worldwide, including UC Irvine, University of Texas at San Marcos, University of Paris in France and USC. The USC program was founded last semester and collected more than $17,000 from more than 200 students.
This year, the organization hopes to raise a total of $20,000 that will benefit the Los Angeles Mission.
Swipes for the Homeless works directly with USC Hospitality to purchase food with donated dining dollars that will be given to the Los Angeles Mission. Both last semester and this semester, the mission asked for non-perishable goods and meat, in particular.
According to Monica Bral, the organization’s co-president, few students are reluctant to donate their dining dollars. Instead, the organization’s main issue is spreading the word on campus about donation week and reaching out to as many students as possible.
“Our challenge is to raise awareness about the organization throughout campus,” Bral said. “We are working on ways to market ourselves and hope we will reach more students this semester. Once students know about it then [they] are almost always willing to donate.”
Several students said the organization is right to focus on promoting its cause. Madeline Berry, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience, said she would have donated much more of her unused dining dollars as a freshman if she had known about the program last year.
“It’s a really great idea, but I wish I’d known about it sooner because I spent a lot of money unnecessarily last year just because I knew I had the money to spend,” Berry said. “I would have been able to donate even more than I did to people that actually needed it if I’d heard about it sooner.”
This year, Swipes for the Homeless has reached out to students, particularly freshmen, through increased advertising and fliers with detailed information about how the donation process works.
Students can donate any amount of their remaining dining dollars by stopping at one of the organization’s tables, located outside of the USC Bookstore and Trojan Grounds. According to Swipes for the Homeless Co-President Sabrina Aziz, donating is easier than ever.
“If students want to donate, they can stop by our tables this week and sign up to donate their extra dining dollars,” Aziz said. “The dining dollars will not be touched until the end of the semester when students don’t have access to the money anymore. Students can even just write ‘remaining balance’ so that if they have a remaining balance at the end of the semester, instead of being wasted, it will go to the L.A. Mission.”
Liz Friedman, a freshman majoring in international relations and global business, says that Swipes for the Homeless is a constructive way to use her remaining dining dollars at the end of the semester.
“I definitely want to donate the rest of my money to Swipes for the Homeless because otherwise I feel like I’m buying food that I don’t really need,” she said. “You lose money if you don’t spend all of your dining dollars that you paid for in the beginning of the semester, so why not donate the rest to a great cause?”
Swipes for the Homeless has received a great reception from the Trojan community, and Bral said this support will ensure that the organization will continue collecting donations in the future.
“It is a great cause and we get a lot of positive feedback from students, faculty and staff,” Bral said. “It is a win-win situation because students do not have access to their cards and money any longer, and the homeless can really use the meals. For us it’s a swipe, for them it’s hope.”
This is such a win-win program for students and those we feed at the Los Angeles Mission. I wish every campus in America took this on as a challenge to support the feeding of homeless in it’s local community.

USC’s Ostrow School of Dentistry received a $18.4 million grant from First 5 LA in support of Ostrow’s dental care outreach to youth in Los Angeles County.
First 5 LA, an organization aimed at optimizing the development and well-being of children  in Los Angeles County from birth to age five, oversees the L.A. County allocation of funds from a 50-cent tax imposed on tobacco products sold in California following the passage of Proposition 10 in 1998. All proceeds from the tax go toward health care, education and child development programs.
One of the principal goals of First 5 LA is to expand health insurance coverage for all children under five years of age who are not eligible for existing plans. The grant, which is the largest in Ostrow’s history, will support the school’s dental care outreach to young children in L.A. County and will also enable the school’s Community Oral Health Programs to help nearly 46,000 disadvantaged children and their families over the next five years.
Portions of the grant will go toward the operation of a new dental facility at the Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center Hub Clinic.
The clinic, run by the Violence Intervention Program, will aid approximately 15,000 children currently in foster care. The grant will also allow the Ostrow school to develop and implement a sedation program at a dental clinic run by the St. John’s Well Child and Family Center.
The grant funds will also be put toward the prevention and further education of oral health problems. In addition to teaching primary care physicians and nurses to spot potential oral health problems and educating dentists on oral problems unique to youth, the grant will allow the Ostrow school to admit two additional residents to its Pediatric Dentistry residency program each year.
One of the program’s primary goals, however, is ensuring children of families in need have access to affordable insurance and dental clinics, according to USC.
Roseann Mulligan, associate dean for community health programs and hospital affairs at Ostrow, said helping families learn about dental health remains her top priority.
“If we can give families with young children information about oral health and help them locate dental homes, we can use education and prevention to stop disease before it starts instead of repairing the damage,” Mulligan said in a statement.

British celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay’s casual dining spot The Fat Cow represents the latest culinary addition to The Grove shopping center, replacing The Farm of Beverly Hills on Oct. 1 with farm-fresh foods at Beverly Hills prices.
Moos for the money· The Fat Cow accents its clever creations with images indicative of its brand. Though these details are a nice touch, the restaurant clearly prioritizes atmosphere over quality dishes. – Sara Worth | Daily Trojan
The Grove opened in 2002 as an antidote to the vintage charm of The Farmer’s Market with hopes of drawing wide-eyed tourists and the L.A. glitterati back to Third Street. As an addition to the high-end shopping center, The Fat Cow ultimately offers pleasant, casual food informed by high-rent sensibilities, yet falls short of its highly anticipated gourmet caliber.
Described by a waiter as “California comfort with a London flair,” The Fat Cow’s pricey-yet-accessible menu of tavern staples could elevate any movie night. Its flexibility and wealth of options make it a prime spot for families and romantic occasions, and its distinctly English offerings, such as shepherd’s pie and sticky toffee pudding, help make The Fat Cow an exciting new novelty spot in the company of chain restaurants.
As television host of Hell’s Kitchen and Kitchen Nightmares, Ramsay has made exceedingly clear his commitment to exceptional food and service. He is known as a temperamental perfectionist and holds several Michelin stars, a rare recognition awarded by anonymous reviewers in annually released Michelin guidebooks.
In line with Ramsay’s critical recognition, The Fat Cow shines most through its comfort foods. The mac & cheese, served in a cast-iron pan, has a lovely texture from its crispy breadcrumb top to the gooey, bechamel bottom. The meatballs are light and herby in a sweet tomato sauce. The Fat Cow Fries are crispy and not greasy, with a distinct potato flavor indicative of the restaurant’s commitment to fresh market produce. The Buffalo Mozzarella and Vodka Sauce Pizza is nearly divine and well worth $15, with its perfectly crispy, semi-blackened and stone-baked crust.
Unfortunately, a number of other dishes fall short of expectations.
The Fat Cow Cheese Burger is a child’s idea of a “medium” cook — dry, tasteless, void of any pink at the center. Its brioche bun looks delightful with an embossed cow logo, but tastes like it might have come out of a freezer and barely been warmed through. The Caesar salad appetizer is mild and tasty, yet overdressed. Overwhelmed by grated Parmesan cheese and victimized by crumbly, underwhelming croutons, the salad stands as a disappointment brightened only slightly by the presence of a single soft-boiled egg.
At dessert time, The Moo Bar falls a bit short as well. The Eton Mess is perhaps appropriate for the mess hall at an aristocratic English college, but the inclusion of modest bits of crumbled meringue is not worth the $10 spent on a glorified berry parfait.
The Fat Cow boasts more attention to detail in its decor than in its fare. High-ceilinged and naturally well-lit, the room feels large and has ample seating. The rustic-chic communal tables and brown leather booths (with hobnail upholstery tacks) are comfortable and catalyze conversation. Faux-rustic trappings — Edison bulbs, packing-crate light fixtures, raw wood beams, rope and milk bottles — feel hip but not overly designed. From its salvaged-wood mirrors to its barn-door bathroom stalls, the design scheme reflects the hybrid, transcontinental theme of the restaurant.
But this theme feels perhaps overdone and inauthentic in The Fat Cow’s attempt to conform to its upscale locale. In Ramsay’s attempt to bring gourmet English food to West Hollywood at reasonable prices, some integrity has been lost in translation.
Despite an attempt to bridge an authentic English tavern aesthetic with that of smooth, contemporary Los Angeles, the only real British presence is that of The Libertines’ second album on the stereo. With “Fat Cow” written on the wall with Green Room-style bulbs, the restaurant conforms to its flashy surroundings. The dark brick veneer lining the walls reveals an unexpected shallowness. The menu features at least three distinct typefaces, but includes the glaring typo “Fires” instead of “Fries.” Mistakes such as this one seem appropriate for a stale corporate endeavor but not for a brand-new brain project. The Fat Cow seems more like a branch of a chain than the new casual dining adventure of a famous restaurateur.
Lunch at The Fat Cow is an alienating experience, with prices not justifying the inconsistent quality of dishes customers receive. In this sense it fits in perfectly at the mall — a place to spend money and feel en vogue. The dining spot is perhaps the best executed version of a typical Grove destination — expensive and glitzy but ultimately disappointing — and not worth the hassles of parking.
Ramsay’s latest installment offers stylishly delivered, above-average British and American fare. The Fat Cow might offer unique dishes, such as a steak cooked in an au courant water bath, but does not satisfy across the board. It better serves its patrons in its more classic comfort dishes — customer-oriented, inviting meals — than in higher-rent offerings. Several distinct menu options are worth the tab, but at The Fat Cow, you’re really paying for the rent.
Having had lunch at the Fat Cow, I find this article remarkably accurate and entertaining–way better than my lunch–and yes, parking is a hassle.
I think your harsh review of ramsays restaurant is absolutely outrageously harsh..and I haven’t even eaten there yet. additionally, anyone who refers to eating in a restaurant as an “alienating experience” needs to take a writing class…no wonder the only publication that would hire you bears the name of a prophylactic!!!!!
Wow, real mature.
You donkey you burned the risotto!

Whether you celebrate Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or even Festivus, winter break is always the much-anticipated halfway point of the academic year. If Thanksgiving is considered an appetizer, then winter break is the main course. Reaching this point isn’t an easy feat, so even if you bombed all your finals, all isn’t completely lost. You have about four weeks to completely forget everything you’ve learned and begin anew in January.
The time away from coursework and extracurricular commitments is a chance to re-evaluate your priorities. For some, free time might be a foreign concept and even a little intimidating. But don’t be scared: Use it to your advantage. Winter break is a period when you can actually read for pleasure — wait, people still do that? — and catch up on TV shows without the cloud of ignored assignments looming overhead.
December and January also provide the opportunity to enjoy the ever-fleeting wet season of SoCal that we call winter, or to go to a place where snow is actually a thing. The jetsetters out there will use these upcoming weeks for extensive travel; personally, it always seemed odd to spend the winter holidays in a tropical locale, but hey, that’s just me. I guess Santa has to visit Hawaii and Cabo, too.
Most, however, will be returning home. Whereas Thanksgiving break was a teaser,  a trip back home that lasted three to four days at most, students are in it for the long haul during winter break. That is a solid three weeks and some change spent with parents, siblings and extended family, but also a break spent away from the friends whom you see nearly every day at school.
On the other hand, a chance to reconnect with family and old friends from back home isn’t such a bad thing. You know that Christmas spirit people are always talking about during December? It’s actually just a concept that we should be familiar with throughout the calendar year: treating others how we want to be treated and giving rather than receiving.
Speaking of, presents are great, but the true gift of time away from school is that you can spend it however you want, doing whatever you want. Though the commercial aspect of the winter holidays is inescapable, don’t lose sight of what’s actually important. Instead of racing around buying gifts, wouldn’t it be better to watch the “25 Days of Christmas” on ABC with your family while drinking spiked hot chocolate? If that’s too sentimental, look at it this way: Even a Scrooge can enjoy being in the company of people he or she loves — or, at the very least, finds tolerable for extended periods of time.
Going home for winter break will make you appreciate the freedom found at college. At home, it’s not quite as acceptable to knock on your roommate’s door in the middle of the night for random conversation — probably because your “roommates” are sleeping parents and siblings. At college, sleep is a precious commodity only reserved for weekends, not weeknights when so many other tasks can be accomplished, such as procrastination and social networking. During the winter holidays, we can catch up on sleep, so close Facebook for the night and catch some much-needed rest while you can.
On the flip side, you also learn to appreciate your family more since you’re not always around them. Mom’s cooking tastes even better, and miraculously, the fridge is always fully stocked and household supplies never run out but are always replaced. Having Dad around to take care of household and/or car maintenance is more convenient than waiting to take action until your car breaks down on the side of the road because of a lack of upkeep. And a shower at home feels much more refreshing than one in crappy on- or off-campus housing.
Holidays spent at home also herald the arrival of traditions. Love ’em or hate ’em, they’re here to stay. Some are stupid. Some are outdated. Some might even bring up bad memories.
But what would the holidays be without a tinge of nostalgia?
You might pretend to hate it when you’re forced to eat Aunt Martha’s Jell-O fruit salad that jiggles unnaturally or when the same old Christmas songs play on every station, but when else do these occur? Admit it: Hating these traditions is part of the fun. A holiday wouldn’t be the same without them. So the next time you hear “Have a Holly Jolly Christmas,” don’t consider homicide by way of candy cane. Just remember these songs, and other irritating traditions, need only be endured for a few weeks every year.
Winter break is when college students are granted well-earned liberty. You can perfect the art of doing nothing and bask in post-finals glory. Catch up with friends who you don’t see any other time of the year and learn to tolerate — and maybe even be entertained by — the quirks that abound in your family. After all, the holidays should serve as reminders to appreciate what we have.
In short: Happy Chrismahanukwanzaakuh.

Rich, vibrating chords fuse into a whimsical melody, crisp as morning air. It’s such descriptions that sum up the aural confections of Slovenian guitarist Mak Grgic, a graduate student at the USC Thornton School of Music, who stands at the cusp of his blooming career, brimming with talent and ready to take the music world by storm.
Slovenian serenade · Thornton student Mak Grgic has already jumpstarted a promising career. The 25-year-old already has awards from festivals, such as “Luigi Mozzani” and Pacific Guitar Festival, under his belt. – | Photo courtesy of Mak Grgic
At 25, Grgic is well on his way to greater heights. Since his Russian debut in 2009 with the Petersburg Symphony Orchestra, his acclaim and recognition have only grown, especially after The Washington Post ran a review of Grgic’s performance at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in October. Praising Grgic for exploring the works of baroque lutenist Sylvius Leopold Weiss “with real intelligence,” the article proclaimed Grgic’s “superb, finely detailed reading” of Weiss’ “Passacaglia in D Major” as “the high point of the evening.”
Even without these positive reviews,  a background of performing at stellar worldwide venues — not to mention the many pieces he’s recorded, the most recent being music for the film Regrets of White Camellias — gives Grgic the power to stand alone. From the Grande Auditorium di Espinho in Portugal to Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif. (where he performed as a guest of American classical guitarist Christopher Parkening), Grgic has impressed, playing with world-class artists, such as the Assad Brothers and cello master Joshua Roman. Recently, Grgic won first prize at the Guitar Competition “Luigi Mozzani” in Italy as well as the Pacific Guitar Festival and Competition 2011 in California.
Despite having traveled far and wide, Grgic has found a home in USC. Compared to the stricter, efficiency-driven teaching style of the institutions he previously attended, Grgic says USC is a breath of fresh air.
“Coming here eased up the edges. It was the first time I actually started breathing and not worrying about someone pointing a finger at me for mistakes,” Grgic said. “[Consequently], I became a more stable player as well —  it’s just done more good than what I would have expected. It’s the environment I’m in, surrounded by so many great guitarists carrying the legacy of just enjoying music.”
William Kanengiser, of the Grammy Award-winning Los Angeles Guitar Quartet, guides Grgic as his music instructor at USC. Grgic’s mentor of almost two years, Kanengiser has acknowledged him as an exceptional musician.
“Mak possesses the ability to be expressive, technically brilliant. … He’s able to find personal expression within the constraints of the classical form,” Kanengiser said. “He’s already on his way to having a career, he’s performed for series of concerts and won competitions, but what he’s doing is finding his artistic voice and personality. That takes a very talented student and musician to the level of being an artist, and that’s what he’s working towards.”
Surprisingly, prowess on guitar had not always been the goal for Grgic. His love for the guitar began serendipitously with a stroll in the park. On that fateful day, a 10-year-old Grgic passed the music school in Slovenia with his father while auditions were happening — and in that moment, he became “intrigued.”
Yet even after this encounter, guitar was not a priority.
“I didn’t even want to play guitar, to be quite honest,” Grgic said. “My dad was the one who initiated the choice of instrument. He decided that violin was too loud for the beginning, and the piano was too big for the apartment. He just said, ‘Here’s a guitar, learn a song or two, learn to sing along with it.’ Today, I’m happy that it worked out as it did.”
After beginning to play the guitar at age 11, Grgic continued to juggle music school and normal school on a daily basis and even kept up with his avid passion for the martial arts. The turning point for his music career, however, came unexpectedly at the end of his teenage years. At age 19, after breaking his thumb in a fight tournament, he decided to pursue music and music alone.
“Basically, right then I said, ‘Okay, let’s decide what I want to do,’” he said.
Following his decision, Grgic pushed forward in pursing his musical career, earning a bachelor’s degree in music at the University for Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, Austria.
Grgic notes that his career path has properly served a passion for music that comes as naturally as breathing for the young performer. It’s also a career that Grgic won’t tire of anytime soon.
“You just feel it. You just go for it. The more excited you are, the more it will show,” he said. “Regardless of looking ahead [at] what’s going to happen, I think it’s always important to do what you enjoy. If you manage to integrate that into your profession, you can’t really ever get bored or discouraged or sad about something you love. Challenges are easily dealt with if you enjoy what you’re doing it. I work from when I wake up until I go to bed, but I don’t mind because I love music.”
In fact, when it comes to picking favorites among pieces, Grgic is always between a rock and a hard place.
“With pieces, if you find quality and intrigue in them, it’ll be one of your favorites,” Grgic said. “But to have a favorite piece, that’s literally impossible.”
The upcoming months are booked with a slew of performances, many of which are organized through the Da Camera Society, a prestigious performing arts foundation in Los Angeles that has named Grgic a Young Artist in Residence. Besides a performance with the legendary Assad Brothers in Denver coming soon, Grgic will also play with the renowned JACK Quartet in the premiere of Philip Glass Ensemble member David Crowell.
John Richards, founding violinist of the JACK Quartet, worked with Grgic two summers ago in 2011 while premiering a new guitar quintet by Slovenian composer Nina Senk.
“Mak is a charming performer and a wonderful guitarist,” Richards said. “We had a wonderful time playing with him and we look forward to getting to work with him again.”
Though all arrows point to more success in the future, Grgic stays grounded.
“I have ways to go. I’m just working my way up,” he said. “As a pupil learning from the big names, I take what I think is good and implement it. I have to borrow little things, strive to take them and make them my own.”
One thing is for sure — his potential is the real deal. After working with Grgic on past performances, Gary Sheldon, conductor of the Miami City Ballet, can attest to not only his individual talent but his innate ability to collaborate with other musicians — a characteristic that will undoubtedly serve Grgic well.
“Ultimately, music is about sharing and playing together and finding something deeper than just the notes on the page, and Mak has an ability to do that — not just as a soloist but as a performer with orchestras,” Sheldon said. “He listens, he adapts and he makes an experience a truly shared experience.”

The public uproar earlier this year over unconstitutional provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act pushed Congress to pass Amendment 3018 last Thursday, banning a key provision of the NDAA that authorized indefinite detention of U.S. citizens.
Yiwen Fu | Daily Trojan
Despite partisan shortcomings, Congress has shown that it can rally members of both parties to prevent the abridgement of essential civil liberties that are guaranteed by the Constitution: in this case, the fundamental right to due process of law.
Sponsored by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Mike Lee (R-Utah), Amendment 3018 offers an example of the legislature taking a stand against excessive government power, which, if allowed to grow unchecked, would erode the constitutional foundations of this country.
Increased security measures have been a product of the post-9/11 era, marked by paranoia and a nearly unprecedented amount of executive power, often putting civil liberties on the backburner in the name of national security. The NDAA, which remains official law except for the provision that was banned last week, is only one example of legislation that reflects this.
The NDAA contains disconcerting provisions that reflect the current secondary status of constitutionally guaranteed rights in the United States. The section addressed by Amendment 3018, Section 1021, granted the government the power to indefinitely imprison any U.S. citizen suspected of anti-American activity. This not only gave the government too much discretion — it also violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights to habeas corpus and due process of law.
President Barack Obama inexplicably signed the NDAA into law last December, despite citizens’ outrage that it would put our most basic constitutional rights at stake. To appease the angry public, Obama promised that though the NDAA was officially law, “under no circumstances will my Administration accept or adhere to a rigid across-the-board requirement for military detention.”
The issue is not whether or not the president would have used this power, but the fact that he even had such unchecked power in the first place. Congress’ response last week sends the message that it will no longer sit idly by and watch the executive branch throw the Constitution by the wayside in the name of national security.
Though the Constitution acknowledges that the executive branch needs more power to protect the nation during times of war, the government has become far too comfortable curtailing the civil liberties of its citizens by pushing paranoia of imminent destruction by enemies. It is one thing to detain someone based on evidence of subversive actions, but it is another thing entirely to make it nearly impossible for those detained to contest their charges.
Luckily, many lawmakers have also recognized the dire predicament such issues put the country in. Moments before the amendment was put to vote last week, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky) posed a question that all Americans living in the post-9/11 United States should ask themselves: “What are you fighting against and for if you throw the Constitution out?”
The passage of Amendment 3018 provides hope that our elected officials know that the answer to this is nothing.
Congress’ pushback against the unconstitutional aspects of the NDAA shows that we are headed in the right direction. The government must not be allowed to exploit the fear of its citizens to scrap our nation’s foundational principles, whether in times of war or peace. The executive branch will not go unchecked or unquestioned as long as we have a vigilant citizenry that understands the importance of protecting basic democratic rights, such as the right to face one’s accusers in front of a judge and jury.
Acknowledging the potential of an overly powerful executive to morph into tyranny, Benjamin Franklin said it best: “Those who would give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.”
We must continue to demand liberty at all costs, or we will ultimately have neither liberty nor safety.

In a just world, those sworn to protect and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic would suffer actual consequences for their role in systematically dismantling it.
Tragically, Amendment 3018 doesn’t do what this article or its sponsors claim — it actually does the opposite, making it even easier for the Feds to imprison anyone anywhere simply on the president’s say-so that the victim supports terrorism. Numerous commentators all over the net have explored the amendment’s double-talk and obfuscations.
Congress often pulls this trick, braying at length about how it’s protecting us while it actually forges another link in the chains binding us. A good rule of thumb when dealing w/ these power-hungry sociopaths is to remember that they NEVER decrease govt’s power over us, and the more they insist they have done so, the less we should believe them.

In August, Madonna spoke out for LGBTQ rights at a concert in St. Petersburg, Russia.
“I’m here to say that the gay community, and gay people, here and all around the world, have the same rights,” the singer said. “The same rights to be treated with dignity, with respect, with tolerance, with compassion, with love.”
In response, 10 anti-gay activists filed a lawsuit seeking $10.7 million from Madonna for promoting “homosexual propaganda” and “propaganda of perversion” among youths.
The judge threw the case out after a one-day hearing on Nov. 22, and though that was certainly the right decision, the global struggle against homophobia continues. People cannot dismiss the case as a frivolous anomaly; the lawsuit is merely one of many examples of the entrenched homophobia and traditional heterosexism of Russian society. The trial must be taken seriously by people — especially young people — from all over the world to truly address and dispel such inequalities by speaking out for LGBTQ rights.
Homosexual activity has only been legal in Russia since 1993. But same-sex marriages are still illegal, civil partnerships are not recognized and LGBTQ couples cannot adopt children together. Moscow courts even enacted a 100-year ban on gay pride parades last March.
The lawsuit filed against Madonna reflects a society that is very much stuck in the past. During the trial, plaintiffs claimed that Madonna’s speech, which promoted the acceptance of other sexual orientations, would threaten the “values of a traditional family, which are currently in crisis in this country.” The plaintiffs even went as far as to say that by speaking up for gay rights at her concert, Madonna directly traumatized minors in the audience. It’s hard to miss the irony of this assessment in light of the numerous people — not just in Russia — who are traumatized by homophobia, hate crimes, discriminatory legislature and de facto oppression.
The lawsuit also shows that gay rights are not the only thing at stake: The right to free speech also hangs in balance. Since 2006, nine regions of Russia have enacted bans on “homosexual propaganda,” and St. Petersburg is one of them. It is unclear whether or not the ban was intentionally vague, but either way, it allows people to submit lawsuits like the one filed against Madonna and creates a suppressive environment in which people can and will be persecuted for speaking out for human rights.
And Russia isn’t alone: 76 countries have criminalized homosexuality and advocacy for equal rights with punishments ranging from fines to life in prison. Five countries sentence people to death for same-sex activity.
Just as the lawsuit cannot be written off as a silly rarity, Americans cannot afford to write this off as a far away, foreign issue.
Even in the United States, the reality is that discriminatory laws and deep cultural homophobia are two of the main obstacles that keep people from treating those who identify as LGBTQ as full citizens. Californians, for one, are currently awaiting the Supreme Court’s decisions on Proposition 8, the ballot proposition that defines marriage as only between a man and a woman.
The United States is not immune to the theatrical circus of homophobic dialogue either, from minister John McTernan claiming Hurricane Sandy was caused by a “homosexual agenda” to Senator Michele Bachmann stating that people who identify as homosexual, lesbian, bisexual and transgender “are dealing with the very real issue of sexual dysfunction.”
But far worse than such comments is the fact that these are people with the power to propose and pass discriminatory legislature. Behind every casual homophobic comment is the bigotry that is very much a part of American society, and that bigotry festers in forms such as unfair laws, familial disownment, lack of proper sex education, job discrimination, bullying, harassment and violent assault. For every ludicrous quip or antic that temporarily grabs the public’s attention, there is something far more dangerous and oppressive happening.
The judge in Russia treated one symptom by throwing out the case against Madonna’s “homosexual propaganda,” but the sickness remains. Until discriminatory laws regarding sexual orientation and gender are repealed and protective ones are put in place, and until there is a large cultural shift, homophobia will continue to rear its ugly face in serious, damaging forms.

Madonna was one of the first global artists to stand up and support the LGBT community. Bravo Madonna for your continued love and support. We all live in a more tolerant and accepting world because of efforts you have made throughout the years. Thank you.
