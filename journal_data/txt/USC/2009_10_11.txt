The University Park Health Center has offered free flu shots in years past, but only to about 2,000 people. This year, officials expect things to be different.
This fall the UPHC, in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, will offer free H1N1 vaccine shots during a two-day period in early November, and officials are hoping the numbers will be quadrupled from last year’s flu shot turnout.
Dr. Lawrence Neinstein, director of the UPHC, said he would like to see 8,000 to 10,000 people show up for the free vaccines this year. In 2008, about 2,000 people received the seasonal flu shot vaccine, but Neinstein is preparing for a large-scale distribution this year.
Despite anticipation of high demand for the H1N1 shot, some students said they were wary of the relatively new vaccine.
“I would want to know if it has been tested and what the results are before I get the vaccine myself,” said Hasan Abbas, a sophomore majoring in neuroscience.
Other students said they will not get a flu shot because they don’t feel they need one, despite the widespread media coverage of the H1N1 virus.
“I don’t feel like I need to get the vaccine. I don’t believe it is a pressing issue,” said Madison Pachkowski, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology. “The H1N1 isn’t any different than the normal flu. I feel like it is more publicized and people are more aware of it, but people die from the flu every year.”
Still, officials are recommending the vaccine for everyone, including those who believe they are not susceptible to the flu.
“Unless you were specifically tested for H1N1 then you should still get the vaccine,” Neinstein said. “All indications suggest this is a safe, important and effective vaccine … You’re not just helping yourself but you’re helping everyone else on campus.”
Right now, the UPHC is looking at distributing the vaccine Nov. 3 and Nov. 4 at the Lyon Center, but Neinstein said the date, location and availability of the vaccine are subject to change.
The Department of Public Health will be staffing the event with nurses, supplying the vaccine and bringing the materials for distribution, Neinstein said. In case more people than expected show up on the first day, the county is prepared to bring more of the vaccine for the second day.
Jason Heim, a junior majoring in communications, said he thought the UPHC was right in preparing for more people who want the flu shot.
“I think more people will get the vaccine this year specifically because it is the H1N1. People will go this time who normally wouldn’t go for the regular flu shot,” Heim said.
Tamara Arakelyan, a junior majoring in public policy, managing and planning, said that although she has not gotten a flu shot before, she is considering it this year.
“I didn’t get the vaccine last year but I am more inclined to get it this year because there is so much hype about the H1N1 and I am more aware of it,” she said.
Neinstein noted that the event is not limited to just students.
“We would like to focus on the high priority groups but the county is not going to turn anyone away,” Neinstein said. “The flu kills 10,000 to 15,000 people every year; that is why it is important for everyone to get vaccinated every year, not just for the H1N1.”
There will be other opportunities to get the vaccine, but after this first event it will no longer be free. The UPHC is planning on passing out the vaccine later as well, but it will have to charge a small staffing fee since the county will no longer be bringing in its own staff, Neinstein said. There will also be an opportunity for students to receive the seasonal flu vaccine for free, but it will be separate from the H1N1 vaccine.

In the second installment of the Visions and Voices Program “Get Your Hands Dirty with the Arts,” the USC School of Cinematic Arts joined the four other USC arts schools for the first time to offer workshops and competitions to students.
The daylong festival on Sunday featured workshops taught by faculty from five schools: the Roski School of Fine Arts, Thornton School of Music, School of Theatre, School of Architecture and School of Cinematic Arts — the newcomer to the interactive festival.

Holly Willis, the director of academic programs at the Institute for Multimedia Literacy and a workshop coordinator, said the cinema school’s workshops added more options to the festival and gave students a chance to work with multimedia. Teaching students how to work with multimedia outlets is especially useful today, Willis said, because multimedia has become so commonplace.
“When you think about how pervasive video is becoming with cell phones and cameras, in five or 10 years, it will be expected that people know how to use it — it is part of everyday culture,” Willis said. “A lot of students come in knowing how to use YouTube and other forms of media, but [the interactive video design workshop] shows them the skills to do it professionally.”
The festival covered an array of topics, from salsa dancing to writing a TV show script. Courses titled “Playing Pop Piano,” “3-D Graphics and Prototyping” and “Interactive Video Design” were among the new workshops at this year’s event.
The “Get Your Hands Dirty” event is unique among Visions and Voices events because of its interactive nature.
“There are all types of ways to experience arts and humanities. With this event, students get the chance to experience the arts themselves and see how it impacts the world,” said Daria Yudacufski, managing director of Visions and Voices.
Sunday’s festival featured not only instructional sessions, but also games and contests. A paper tower contest, for example, required participants to construct a tower using only recycled 8.5 by 11-inch paper and no glue or tape, while an improvisation game tested students’ abilities to come up with an entertaining skit on the spot.
Yung-Ching Liang, a physics doctorate student, attended the 3-D design and prototyping workshop where students created a 3-D prototype of a shoe using software called Rhinoceros. He said the workshop had real-world applications, such as work in animation.
“I want to learn 3-D models properly because it is fun and interesting and I like animation and cartoons,” Liang said. “This workshop is useful to [do] that.”
Ryan Logan, a part-time lecturer at Roski, led the “Altered Plates” workshop, where participants used decals to create abstract images or scenes on a glazed plate. He said students should focus on their own interpretation of art.
“Everybody has the ability to be creative,” Logan said. “They don’t necessarily have to think they are not an artist.”
Stephanie Spindler, an undeclared freshman, said she chose to take the altered plates workshop because she is currently not taking any art classes and found the description different from her previous art experience.
“You can discover that you have amazing art skills,” Spindler said. “It is a good way to get involved with the school and start trying little things that might lead to greater things.”

The USC US-China Institute is set to contribute to the bilateral discourse between the United States and China by hosting a delegation of high-level Chinese government officials for a daylong Legal Exchange focusing on Chinese telecommunications and patent law, on campus Monday.
The US-China Legal Exchange is an annual summit hosted in alternating years in the United States or China, that gives representatives from both countries an opportunity to clarify and discuss legal issues from their respective nations. This year, the USC US-China Institute will host the Los Angeles portion of the exchange at the Davidson Conference Center.
“The most important part of the Legal Exchange is that it promotes dialogue and provides an opportunity for direct contact between legal and academic communities with foreign government officials,” said Joel Blank, senior attorney for the Office of the Chief Counsel for International Commerce, who is involved in organizing the exchange.
The Chinese delegation, led by Vice Minister Zhang Qiong from China’s State Council Legislative Affairs Office, will use this year’s exchange to focus on amendments to the Chinese patent law and explain the details of the draft of the Chinese telecommunications law for American service providers and manufacturers who are interested in the Chinese market.
“They are trying to structure this in a way they can attract foreign technology, investment, cooperation and build their own capacity for their domestic market,” said Clayton Dube, associate director of the USC US-China Institute.
Dube added that the event was an opportunity for people from both countries to clarify and learn more about the legal technicalities of their individual legal systems, rather than approach the markets without any knowledge.
“This is not intended to be a debate,” Dube said. “The reason the [Chinese] Ministry of Commerce and US Department of Commerce is putting to this together is because they want greater discussion and understanding.”
The US Department of Commerce asked the institute to be a co-host for the Legal Exchange, in part because of its research which focus on trends that could affect the US-China relationship, rather than generally topical issues, according to Dube.
“We invite people here, send people there, and that kind of back and forth is essential,” Dube said. “If you are only talking about other people, you can get a lot of things wrong. Talking [directly] with people can really help you understand them.”
Blank added that he had identified the institute as an entity in the Los Angeles area with expertise in US-China relations that would also be a good place to hold an event like the Exchange.
“They will help draw experts to the program that are in the academic and non-academic community,” Blank said.
He added that the attendance by the institute’s faculty and students would be beneficial because they can bring their own expertise to the program as well.
The event will feature a number of experts, ranging from lawyers, academic professors and even company representatives to comment on Chinese law and American involvement in the Chinese market, including USC professor Simon Wilkie, an expert on cable, Internet and wireless communications.
According to Dube, the Exchange is just one of the ways  the Institute adds to the national conversation about the bilateral relationship between the two countries, he said. Events like this offer students and faculty a different way of approaching their research.
Ying Jia Huang, a senior majoring in international relations and history who is a student assistant at the Institute, said events like the Exchange provides an opportunity to learn much more about the two countries’ policies than she would have sitting in a classroom.
“You get to meet people who put the policies together, wrote these books, write these articles we read on JSTOR,” Huang said. “The degree of relevance is much more significant than reading through textbooks.”
Following the Exchange in Los Angeles, the Chinese delegation will travel to Chicago and New York City, where they will present more information on the Chinese legal system to local businesses and legal and academic communities.

The No. 14 USC women’s soccer team didn’t miss a beat this weekend as it continued its winning streak by shutting out Arizona and Arizona State to kick off its Pac-10 campaign.
The Women of Troy (10-3, 2-0) stretched their winning streak to nine games after beating Arizona 2-0 Sunday and Arizona State 1-0  Friday. With the shutouts, senior goalkeeper Kristin Olsen notched her name in the record book and became USC’s all-time leader in shutouts with 26.
Good hands · Senior goalie Kristin Olsen became the Women of Troy’s career leader in shutouts after she posted two more this weekend in victories against Arizona State and Arizona, bringing her career total to 26. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan
“I’m pretty happy. I didn’t really take it as a big thing — it just kind of happened. But it’s cool,” Olsen said.
Olsen and the defense have been dominant lately, holding their opponents to just three goals in the past nine games. They stifled the Wildcats’ attack Sunday as Arizona never really threatened to score and forced Olsen into making just two saves.
“[Olsen’s] a better organizer than she’s ever been. She’s not getting as many saves but she’s positioning her team in front of her better to prevent good looks from the opposition,” USC coach Ali Khosroshahin said.
USC got on the board relatively early Sunday, scoring both goals within three minutes of each other in the first half. Before Sunday, the Women of Troy had scored 10 goals in their last four games, but only one of those goals came in the first half.
In the 30th minute, junior midfielder Megan Ohai sent a cross pass to the back post that super-sub Alyssa Dávila, who just entered the game, got a toe on to put in for her team leading sixth goal of the season.
Less than three minutes later, the Women of Troy got on the end of another cross, this time from sophomore midfielder Brittany Kerridge, as freshman forward Samantha Johnson headed the ball into the back of the net for her fourth goal of the year.
“We scored two high quality goals today as the buildup and finish was really good,” Khosroshahin said. “I thought this was one of our better performances of the year.”
The Women of Troy were challenged a little more by Arizona State Friday. In a game that was largely played in the midfield, USC got a counterattack goal from Ohai in the 57th minute and held firm in the backline to earn the victory.
But it wasn’t easy. The Sun Devils frustrated USC’s attack as they condensed play in the middle of the field and gave USC no space to move the ball. The Women of Troy found it difficult to string many passes together, and in the flow of the game, it made sense their goal came off a counter attack.
Sophomore midfielder Ashley Freyer gathered a long pass and touched it ahead to Ohai, who used her body to shield the ball from her defender. Once she turned, it was just her and the goalkeeper who she beat with a shot to the back post.
“I felt her on the inside of me and I tried to turn to the outside and hit it back post,” Ohai said.
Back-post finishing was something USC worked on all week in practice and Khosroshahin was glad to see it paid off.
“I told her after the game that when she made her first touch I was hoping she put it to the back post and she made a great finish,” Khosroshahin said.
Arizona State pressured the Women of Troy after the goal, but the defense held firm and repelled every attack the Sun Devils mounted.
“Everyone was tired. We just tried to clear the ball away, but there were definitely dangerous situations. We had to do well to manage the game and go to the corners,” Olsen said.
Olsen preserved the win in the last two minutes by making a diving save off a header from a Sun Devils’ free kick.
“I just kept an eye on the ball and was able to see around all the defenders and players and when I caught it I just prayed I held onto it,” Olsen said.

The No. 13 USC women’s volleyball team traveled across town this weekend looking for a win against No. 16 UCLA in the Pac-10 conference match at Pauley Pavilion Friday, but the Bruins managed to breeze to a 3-0 sweep (27-25, 25-20, 25-22).
The Bruins defeated the Women of Troy for the fourth straight year, improving UCLA’s record to 13-5 overall and 3-2 in the Pac-10, while the Women of Troy dropped to 13-4 and 2-3.
Falling short · Despite sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter’s double-double, the Women of Troy lost in straight sets to No. 16 UCLA. - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan
“I thought we had a good fight and played extremely hard,” USC coach Mick Haley told usctrojans.com after the game. “We made errors at the wrong time, but I thought we executed the game plan very well.”
Although the loss came as a hard hit to the Women of Troy, several players had excellent games.
Sophomore outside hitter Alex Jupiter snagged her fourth-straight double-double with a team high of 13 kills and 14 digs, while sophomore middle blocker Lauren Williams fired off nine kills without an error. Williams hit .529 in the match, along with seven blocks.
Junior outside hitter Kimmee Roleder left with 10 kills, while hitting .333 in the game.
That was not enough to push the Women of Troy to a win in the first set, however. At the beginning of the set, kills by UCLA’s Dicey McGraw gave the Bruins a quick 4-1 lead.
Junior middle blocker Zoe Garrett got the Women of Troy back up in the game, cutting UCLA’s lead to 6-4. Williams raked in a side-out for USC, as Jupiter recorded three straight kills that allowed the Women of Troy to finally take the lead, 12-11. The set continued with competitive play until a foot fault call on Jupiter tied the game 24-24.
Although Roleder later tied it up with a cross-court shot, Williams missed a shot to give UCLA the set.
“We had that first set in our grasp and we let them off,” Haley said. “We have got to work on sealing the deal. If our team continues with this effort, especially in practice, we are going to be good.”
The second set started out better for USC. Williams’ blocks prompted the Women of Troy to a 7-6 lead, but UCLA took the lead shortly after three straight kills, bringing the score to 9-7. The play went back and forth before it was tied at 13, when UCLA had a 6-2 run to lead 19-15.
Roleder’s roll shot and kill decreased USC’s deficit to 19-18, but UCLA again bounced back and took the 2-0 lead in the match.
Garrett, Roleder, Williams and Jupiter kept the Women of Troy in the lead for a significant period of the third set, generating a 15-11 lead. After a kill by Williams, the Bruins retaliated with three straight. Although Roleder kept the game 20-19 in favor of USC, UCLA pulled back ahead and later sealed USC’s fate with two back-to-back kills.
“We have to be more aware in working on our blocking,” Haley said. “UCLA was able to pass tonight and run their quick offense. Our blockers couldn’t keep up with it, especially on the left side. We have to keep working at that.”
The Women of Troy are back on the road this weekend as they head to the Northwest to play Washington State Friday and Washington Saturday. Both matches are at 7 p.m.
“Our match at Washington State next Friday is everything for us,” Haley said. “We need to be the best we can be. It’s always a hard place to play because of the long travel.”
The problem is the head coach.. he needs to install a more modern quicker offense. Haley’s coaching is hurting this team…
Interesting that the article left out the terrible hitting % of Jupiter and Gysin who had the vast majority of the kill attempts which was the downfall of the match. Lauren Williams needs more playing time along with more kill attempts with her height.  Forcing Taylor Carico out as the setter in her senior year was a big mistake in my opinion as her maturity and leadership is woefully missed.
I’m sick of being the University of Second Choice once again. ughhh!

The doctors who performed the seven-hour reconstructive surgery on USC tailback Stafon Johnson’s throat on Sept. 28 released a statement regarding Johnson’s injury and recovery to clarify conflicting reports.
Dr. Jason S. Hamilton and Dr. Ryan F. Osborne of the Osborne Head and Neck Institute said Johnson suffered an injury “involving more than 70 percent of his larynx.” His voice box was crushed, leaving vital structures for breathing and speech exposed.
Due to Johnson’s injury, in addition to the repairs made on his larynx, “he required placement of a feeding tube from his nose to his stomach, and a tracheostomy tube to help him breathe,” the statement said.
After evaluation of Johnson’s larynx, Hamilton and Osborne noted that Johnson “showed continued progress in a positive direction.” Johnson’s nasogastric tube will be replaced with a gastrostomy tube in order to give Johnson comfort and “to maintain the nutritional balance needed during his recovery.”
Doctors expect Johnson to be discharged from the hospital in a few days.  According to the doctors, Johnson “will require multiple minor laryngeal procedures in the near future, which will be managed on an outpatient basis.”
Doctors believe it is still too early to determine the long-term function of Johnson’s larynx. Despite this, Johnson “has an amazing attitude and a will to overcome all obstacles presented during this difficult time,” the statement said.

This Saturday, I went over to the dark side: I went to a UCLA football game that didn’t involve USC.
A friend of mine offered me a ticket to the Bruins’ game against Oregon, and with the Trojans enjoying their bye week, I decided to take the opportunity to see how the other half lives.
The results were not pretty, to say the least.
After a grinding first half, the Bruins led 3-0 and fans were hopeful that UCLA was about to get its first win against a ranked opponent and garner a few top-25 votes. The Bruins were on the cusp of their fourth win in five games, something they badly needed to stay afloat in the Pac-10 race.
Then all hell broke loose. Four minutes of complete chaos in the form of an absolute meltdown by USC’s cross-town rival.
Oregon defensive back Kenjon Barner caught the opening kickoff of the third quarter and 100 yards later, the Ducks were up 7-3.
On the first play of UCLA’s next possession, redshirt freshman quarterback Kevin Prince’s pass was intercepted by Oregon’s Talmadge Jackson and returned 32 yards for another score.
Ducks 14, Bruins 3 — in just 36 seconds since halftime. But the Bruins weren’t done screwing up.
On their next drive, Prince dropped back to pass again and was hit from behind, causing a fumble that the Ducks recovered. A few plays later, junior wide receiver Jeff Maehl caught a short pass and turned it into Oregon’s third touchdown in four minutes, effectively putting the game out of reach for UCLA’s anemic offense.
Describing UCLA fans’ reaction to the horrible sequence of events they paid to witness would go something like this: mildly discomforted by the kickoff return to utterly pissed off by the interception return, to wholly dejected and devoid of all hope or reason to live after the fumble and third touchdown.
As my friend — a diehard Bruin supporter — aptly observed, that must have been some halftime speech by UCLA coach Rick Neuheisel.
The Bruins didn’t have the offensive firepower to mount any sort of comeback (they failed to score a touchdown in the game), so they were pretty much sunk after that.
The Rose Bowl crowd of more than 77,000 started heading for the exits, many talking about how they would have to drink away their sorrows after the 24-10 loss.
And I don’t blame them. Being the compassionate human being that I am, I felt sorry for them.
I don’t know how UCLA fans continue to hold on. It seems like with the Bruins, it never just rains — it storms, with lightning and tornadoes.
Like last year when quarterback Kevin Craft threw four interceptions against Arizon State, two of which were returned for touchdowns. Or when they had a win in the bag against BYU in the Las Vegas Bowl two years ago and got their game-winning field goal blocked.
The saddest part is that all signs pointed to UCLA rising from the dregs of the Pac-10 and narrowing the gap between USC. Neuheisel deserves credit for injecting some energy over the past two years and creating excitement in Westwood about something other than basketball. Bruin fans buy into this and believe that their program is going to get there one day, that any time now things should turn around.
So when they don’t, people get angry. They want answers. Why can’t the Norm Chow-engineered offense put points on the board? Why aren’t Neuheisel’s top recruits panning out? Why can’t the offensive line pick up a blitz? Why can’t tight end Logan Paulsen catch the football?
When these questions are answered only with sighs, eye rolls and expletives, people start to point the finger — at Neuheisel, at Chow, at players and at each other. It morphs into a losing attitude that feeds on itself and infects the very team everyone is there to support.
Neuheisel tried to keep the sinking ship afloat after the game by grabbing a microphone and addressing the fans, something he does after every home game. He asked the fans to keep believing in the team and said he hoped his Bruins could do better next week.
That has to sound like a broken record to Bruin fans by now.
It’s not easy being a UCLA football fan. Trojan fans simply don’t know how lucky they are, especially those that don’t remember USC football in the 1990s. I was at many of those pre-Pete Carroll games and the atmosphere in Pasadena Saturday took me back to those unspeakable losing days at the Coliseum.
But even as I witnessed UCLA fans become unhinged before my eyes, what I was feeling wasn’t quite sympathy.
It was pity.

Did you wear your “fucla” shirt?
You have to remember with UCLA fans, they are unlike any Trojan fans who turn on their team. UCLA fans are much more loyal even during a losing streak. Trojan fans whine and whine and some even turn their backs on their very own team. I’ve witnessed it. As a Trojan, I am not proud of our attitude. We should be more support of our team during hard times, just like the Bruin fans.

The USC swimming and diving team swept its first invitational this season against Cal State Northridge and Cal State Bakersfield in a two-day competition Friday and Saturday that tackled events across the board.
The women’s team placed first, second and third in every race, while the men’s team took gold in every event. The inaugural USC Invitational was hosted at the McDonald swim stadium, where the pool was adjusted three times across the two-day competition to create a 50-meter long-course pool, a 25-meter short-course pool and a 25-yard short-course pool, ensuring competitors could dip their feet in to a variety of races.
“The challenge of the weekend was represented in the three different courses that we swam and having the athletes swim the same events over each course, and what we saw was each swimmer getting faster throughout the weekend,” men’s assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said.
Highlights on the first day included many Trojan debuts versus Cal State Northridge’s Matadors. Freshman Haley Anderson smashed the competition in her 800-meter freestyle, winning by solid 16 seconds with a time of 8:59.53. Freshman Lili Shiota led the women’s field in the 100-meter backstroke with a time of 1:06.46. Freshman Clement Lefert won 100-meter butterfly by three and a half seconds with a time of 55.27 seconds and snagging his first NCAA “B” cut, which put swimmers in consideration to get invited to the NCAA championships.
Veteran Trojans also played a role in USC’s weekend success, with senior Zoltan Povazsay taking gold in the 200-meter freestyle in a time of 1:55.96 minutes. Sophomore Katinka Hosszu scored three NCAA B cuts Friday in the 200-meter freestyle, the 100-meter fly and the 200-meter individual medley., a significant performance for this early in the season.
Senior women’s captain Krissy Forelli was excited by the potential the team showed so early in the season.
“The team has been working so hard in training so it was really great to see everybody swim through the pain;  the freshmen especially stepped it up,” she said.
Friday’s session saw USC’s men’s team down the Matadors, 80-66; the women won 80-64.
The second day proved just as successful for the Trojans, who swept every event in both short-course yards and short-course meters. Anderson once again showed off her distance skills by taking first in the 800-short course meters freestyle (8:48.19) and the 1,000-yard free (9:55.79).
“They combined the men’s and women’s 1,000 to save time, so Haley Anderson had to swim with the guys and she stayed with them, it was so cool,” Forelli said.
NCAA B cuts were snagged across the board by freshman Jessie Schmitt and junior Dillon Connolly both in the 100-yard breastroke, as well as freshman Yumi So in the 100-yard butterfly and the 100 scm. butterfly. Hosszu scored her fourth B cut for the season in the 200-scm freestyle.
In the scm events, USC’s men sunk CSUN, 106-57, and CSUB, 95-70. USC’s women beat CSUN, 103-60, and CSUB, 104-59.
For short-course yards, USC’s men defeated CSUN, 105-51, and CSUB, 91-72. The Women of Troy beat CSUN, 99-62, and CSUB, 102-61.

Good Hair, a new documentary from comedian Chris Rock, explores the nature of black hair care while also challenging its audience to determine “good” hair from “bad.”
The film, which discusses relaxers, pieces and weaves, addresses a long-lasting and unresolved issue in the black community: Do the pressures for black women to attain straight, cascading hair originate from practicality and preference, or does the trend just represent a whitewashed and deep-seated bed of racially charged insecurities and envy?

Rock’s initial motivation for this film was to offer solace and self-worth to his daughter, who asked him why she didn’t have “good hair.” But Rock’s ultimate goal was to turn people away from their dependency on false hair to feel beautiful, which he attempts through a series of interviews with a diverse range of people, from actresses to a chemist, who demonstrated how the same chemical used in relaxers can also disintegrate an aluminum soda can in just a couple of hours.
But hardly any of his interviewees saw error in their ways.
Nia Long and Raven Simone, two of the most referenced interviewees in the picture, both proudly wear weaves — Simone is even considering starting a weave line of her own. Both actresses had a different opinion about the nature of false hair than the filmmaker’s.
Simone says that her primary goal as part of the film was to help erase stigmas about weaves.
“I want to show people that I’m comfortable with saying that I have a weave and am comfortable to put it out there because I know what I’m doing,” Simone said in an interview.
Long, however, was excited for the chance to candidly address a prevalent yet little-discussed issue among women in the black community.
“[I wanted women to] have dialogues about their hair, have dialogues about what they feel is beautiful, have dialogues about their innermost beauty secrets and their innermost beauty struggles,” Long said.
In Good Hair, Rock prys into the subconscious of his female interviewees to see how the reliance on weaves and relaxers affects self-esteem, but Long and Simone, like many of the others, denied that this reliance had a solid impact on the way they see themselves.
“My self-esteem isn’t changed because underneath my weave, I have very strong, good hair,” Simone explained. “I put [the weave] in so that it can stay strong and good.”
Likewise, Long rejects the idea that her use of false hair is motivated by envy of Caucasian hair, claiming that it’s more practical.
“I’m an actress. I’m a mom. I have to take him on meetings, I have to take him to school — you know there are so many different things that come into play in my world that … I have to be ready for action at any time,” Long said. “It’s just easier having extensions because my hair is not being damaged.”
But it seems that natural hair is just not an option for Hollywood celebrities when in the public eye — even when they feel comfortable with themselves.
“There are people who don’t understand it,” Simone said of being in public with her natural hair. “I got feedback as if ‘she looks like a poodle’ because it’s curly and short.”
Simone and Long seem to take a more lenient standpoint regarding which alterations are and aren’t acceptable for self-beautification.
“Its just, you know some people look in the mirror and they say, ‘You know, listen. I want to look like Beyoncé,’ and your hair might not be long like Beyoncé’s. That doesn’t mean you don’t have good hair,” Simone said. “It just means you have to put some stuff in it so you can look like Beyoncé.”
Although Long and Simone deny that changing their hair texture is any matter of race, actress and interviewee Tracie Thoms disagrees. In the film, Thoms states that “to keep my hair the same texture that grows out of my head is looked at as revolutionary. Why is that?”
For Simone and Long, empowerment comes not from the acceptance of your natural self, but in the acceptance of your altered self.
“If you don’t have a lot of hair and you feel like that’s a major issue in your life and you want a hair weave, by all means, if it makes you feel better about yourself, go get it,” Long said.
Simone believes that more than anything, the issue of “good hair” is one of style and not of race.
“I don’t look at people as if, ‘That’s a white person, that’s a black person…’” Simone said. “I just look at people and say, ‘Hey I like her style.’”
This reasoning, however, only leads to the more vague question of whose hair types make for attractive styles. While a white woman sporting an afro still remains a rare case, Long and Simone agrees that people of all races have hair issues, making the themes addressed in Good Hair all the more universal.
“It’s not a black or white thing. It really is a hair thing,” Long said.
Long also believes the use of false hair needs to be a conscious decision.
“My thing is, it shouldn’t just be about the outside. If you’re doing your work on the inside, then the outside becomes far less important because you do feel good about yourself,” she said. “The work really starts there.”
It appears that the movie Rock envisioned and the movie that resulted are two very different products. While Rock set out to make his daughter feel more comfortable in her own skin, the majority of the female celebrities involved pushed for acceptance of the artificial.
“It’s the way it is,” Simone said.
“Appreciate everything about us — whether your hair is yours, a weave, whatever — so that we can embrace who we are,” Long added.

“Do you still feel like a schoolgirl?”
This is the question posed to Jenny — the 16-year-old protagonist of An Education — by her 30-something seducer David after being exposed to a sophisticated life in the big city of London. It is through Jenny’s vivacity and awe that we as the audience are able to seamlessly take part in the seduction as well.
Growing pains · The award-winning An Education is a coming-of-age tale about a teenage girl finding her freedom in 1960s suburban London. - Photo courtesy of Sony Pictures Classics
Directed by Lone Scherfig and written by High Fidelity author Nick Hornby, the film introduces Jenny (Carey Mulligan) as a young and naïve girl who so eagerly wants to learn about the world outside her own. This yearning for knowledge and experience leads her to a much older lover.
An Education is stunningly captivating, mainly through its style, which portrays the restlessness of a young adult without being exaggerated or obnoxious. The film illustrates the ease and need of seduction, especially when there is such a desperate urge to be mature.
When Jenny first meets David (Peter Sarsgaard), she is trapped in a life of routine and preparation: studying excessively to be accepted to Oxford University and aspiring to finally break free from her parents and become a woman. Although Jenny is incredibly determined, all she has are fantasies — until she meets David.
David has charm — charm that is dangerous enough to disguise his attempts at seduction as he easily entices Jenny and her parents, who fall for his allure just as easily as she does. Once David enters Jenny’s life, schoolwork and Oxford become less important than living out in the world, free from traditional societal conventions. With David, an enigmatic older man who appears to be nothing less than perfect, Jenny’s new education completes itself with fancy restaurants, sports cars, art and music.
The film boasts a terrific cast, including Alfred Molina and Cara Seymour as Jenny’s persistent parents, as well as Olivia Williams and Emma Thompson as her formal academic instructors. Jenny views all four as a unified force maintaining her adolescence while she so desperately seeks the sense of maturity David provokes in her.
This maturity springs from that other, sophisticated world, embodied flawlessly by Sarsgaard. He seems to be everything Jenny desires and his culture feverishly consumes her —  a notion much more powerful and disgraceful than that of sexuality alone — which is the ultimate basis of his seduction.
An Education demonstrates an outstanding desire to learn, to understand and to be accepted — exemplified beautifully by the expressions on Jenny’s face as she absorbs this new and exciting culture. With Mulligan’s elegance and stunning displays of emotions, Jenny is the heart of the film and there is not one young actress out there capable of portraying Jenny’s gleeful desire better than Mulligan.
The 24-year-old actress fuses passion and innocence together brilliantly. Her attitude is human, and it pleads for disappointment just as bad as it pleads for satisfaction.
Jenny is too young to fully understand the difference between passion and innocence, of both for an accurate maturity, and as they both certainly happen, she becomes even more of a school girl.
Mulligan brings us into the life of a young woman so desperate to learn, and she does in fact learn something. It is incredibly enjoyable to do so along with her and share the anxiety and excitement of being Jenny’s age.
Mulligan also allows the audience to feel every part of her restlessness and eagerness, which puts joy at the same level as despair.
An Education illustrates the exciting yet dangerous nature of growing old before one should. Jenny is a universal character who transcends gender and allows the audience to experience the desperation and the misunderstandings of being young for what sometimes seems like forever.
These attributes are addressed, perfected and made blatantly vital by great direction, an intelligent script and a beneficial cast and, most importantly, by a young actress who is quickly maturing herself.

As America continues to deal with the repercussions of the economic crisis, Wall Street has moved on more quickly than expected. Investment banks are still searching for new, profitable products, and the latest one has “subprime” written all over it.
The new plan is to buy life settlements — insurance policies that ill and elderly people sell for cash — and securitize them by packaging thousands of them together into bonds that can be sold to investors. When the people die, the investors receive cash from insurance companies. Essentially, the banks are selling bets on how long the insured people will live — the earlier they die, the higher the return.
Thomas Curry | Daily Trojan
There are a few benefits to the idea. Banks who are leading the charge, such as Credit Suisse Group and Goldman Sachs, are arguing that they provide a public service by allowing ill and elderly people to cash out of their policies at higher rates than their insurance agencies will give. And if the bundles of life insurance prove to be highly profitable for the investment banks, they could help speed economic recovery. After all, one thing we have learned from the global scale of the economic crisis has been that the strength of a country’s financial system is key to its overall strength; what is good for Wall Street is often good for America.
But economic strength is not measured just by size and profit margins. Soundness is important too. Promoters of this new product argue that it can be done safely by combining policies covering people with a variety of diseases and issued by a range of insurance companies. That way, if any one disease were to be cured, or if any one company were to go under, the damage to bondholders would be minimal.
Unfortunately, this is virtually the same logic that led credit agencies to give all-star AAA ratings to securitized subprime mortgages; because the packages included home loans from different regions and with different credit levels of borrowers, there was no expectation that they could lose significant value. Then housing prices dropped nationwide, and we all are still coping with the results.
A lesson that we should have learned from the financial crisis was that gambling on Wall Street to this extent is a bad idea. Low-risk investments traditionally refer to ones that stand to lose only a little money, but now it’s come to mean investments that have a small chance of losing a lot of money. Though it is likely to be profitable, the gamble is a huge potential threat to the country’s economy as a whole and should not be permitted.
For example, if health care reform were to pass and resulted in longer lifespans, the packaged insurance policies would plummet in value. Banks’ balance sheets would again be full of bad debt, credit could dry up and we might experience the last two years all over again. It is the government’s responsibility to step in and ensure that investment banks are not given another chance to put our economy on the line.
This is not the biggest problem with the new product, however. Nobody pretends to think that ethics trump profits on Wall Street, but few have stopped to wonder if there is something seriously wrong with investing in people dying early.
Rita Yeung | Daily Trojan
Do we really want to bet against a cure for cancer? Something that has been the dream of the medical research community for years would suddenly represent a potential threat to the entire death-insurance financial system — which would put us in a precarious position. After all, the system promotes the sale of policies that pay off the quicker people die.
It seems pretty crass to minimize risk by making sure that each securitized bond includes people with leukemia, heart disease, lung cancer and diabetes; if too many people have one disease and the cure is developed, the value of the bond would plummet. In all of the financial analysis of the potential gains and losses from the new product, it seems that the gross immorality of its very nature has been forgotten.
It is as if we have learned nothing from the 2007 economic collapse. We should not be gambling. We should not be creating moral hazard and encouraging predatory tactics. In the subprime mortgage market, it was lending to people who banks knew could not pay back their loans. Today, it is issuing insurance policies to people specifically for the purpose of having them sell it back for cash.
But most importantly, we should not pretend that there is such thing as a free lunch. Somebody is going to lose in this equation — whether it is the investors (because people won’t always die), the insurance companies (because they will have to pay out a higher percentage of their policies) or, most likely, the consumer (because this product will definitely lead to higher premiums on insurance policies).
This idea looks smart to Wall Street because, in reality, it will probably make them a lot of money. But it is unethical for Washington to allow it. If the idea takes off and becomes the $500-billion industry that it is conservatively estimated, we’ll have compromised our ethics for a cash windfall. Securitizing life insurance policies is speculative, a repeat of the subprime market and morally abhorrent.
When will we learn?
Daniel Charnoff is a junior majoring in international relations (global business).
Unfortunately, this is another piece that was done without the proper research.
1) Life policies are an ASSET (established by Congress in 1911). An elderly who no longer needs insurance, can’t afford the premiums anymore and/or was hit by the financial crisis of the last 2 years no longer must just let the policy lapse or accept the puny surrender value offered by the carrier. He/she can sell their policy
2)Cancer, leukemia, heart diseae, etc usually occurs in people ages 45-75. A person in his/her
80s will not be able to benefit much from these medical advances as their bodies most likely cannot accept such powerful remedies
3)This market is not even close to the size of the mortgage market
4)Check out the recent Congressional hearings whereby state representatives are arguing (and winning) for
the right of their elderly constituents to sell this asset to raise money (think Madoff victims)
5)Unlike MBS, where people can and have defaulted en masse, mortalities will always occur. It is a wonderful non-correlated asset to have in one’s portfolio
6) And as far as “rooting” for people to die, how do you think about companies that are paying pensions to retired seniors. They certainly benefit from early mortalities. How about banks that offer “reverse mortgages”? They certainly are “rooting” for early mortalities. How about Life Annuities, a liability of the life insurance carrier. Certainly they benefit from the holder’s passing.
Please spend a little more time on research next time. One of the biggest policy buyers is Warren Buffet. I don’t think that he’s evil!

It wasn’t so long ago that Washington bailed out the largest banks in the United States, prompting a wave of criticism from many quarters. But today, the banking system is seeing the effects of non-intervention, which has allowed for the collapse of 100 small American banks in 2009 alone. With these developments, the small bank model is slowly disappearing — an issue complicated by the fact that small banks hold a substantial portion of real estate loans for commercial properties.
There are many signs that the economy as a whole is stabilizing, but trends like these are ominous. Luckily, the failure of these financial institutions has not had much of an effect on the everyday lives of their investors, thanks to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC has been closing an increasing number of failing banks, but they have been preserving depositors’ assets in the process.
Granted, there are limits on FDIC insurances to investors; currently, the FDIC covers around $250,000 per account. But the institution’s funds, which previously ran over the $50-billion mark, have still been under increasing strain. In order to balance its budget, the FDIC has begun imposing higher and earlier payments on healthy banks — the costs of which will no doubt be transferred to investors one way or another.
Furthermore, because the current failures are affecting small banks, the old small-town bank is becoming a thing of the past. New ownership by bigger institutions affects communities in somewhat insidious ways. Although most people’s actual money will remain secure, tighter lending policies and the discontinuation of favorable credit and interest rate policies may increase the financial strain on longtime customers.
The larger banks, such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been strengthening and rebuilding in recent months. But in many ways, their improvement comes at the expense of their smaller competitors. When the FDIC shuts down a bank, it transfers that institution’s assets into the hands of another bank, which can then close branches and make institutional changes to lower the actual costs of the purchase.
Proponents of this strategy argue that failing banks need to be closed for the sake of the economy at large, because when banks fall into debt, they become increasingly unwilling to lend, stifling the potential investment of many customers.
A main reason why small banks are so critically affected is that members invest overwhelmingly in local real estate projects. But as strip malls and housing developments become less profitable, banks are left feeling the burn of their borrowers’ bankruptcy.
Small banks didn’t always fund  housing ventures. In the 1970s, the government worked to fight inflation by raising interest rates and homeowners saw the value of their properties rise substantially. Then at the start of the 1980s, the savings and loan industry, which had funded most major construction projects and private home purchases, collapsed. As the number of new properties being built fell, their demand grew, raising prices and interest rates even more dramatically. At the same time, federal housing assistance decreased and homelessness skyrocketed.
This problem has never truly been resolved, forcing many Americans to pay exorbitant prices for housing or else do without. And most homebuyers have to pay extortionary interest rates on loans which often span half a lifetime, since the average income is not nearly enough to reasonably match the cost of a home. The biggest problem for the banking system lies in the fact that today, roughly half of all commercial real estate loans rest in the hands of small banks. As people lose their jobs and cannot pay off their loans, these institutions are failing rapidly.
Unfortunately, the financial forecast is equally grim: Rather than recovery, analysts expect that increasing numbers of small- and medium-sized banks will be facing closure in the next few years. In fact, Foresight Analytics, a real estate market analysis group, estimates that close to 600 institutions may be at risk of collapse by 2011.
There is still a shred of optimism; larger banks tend to only place a small portion of their investments in commercial real estate, and so remain relatively insulated for now. But even with the big banks’ overall progress, dealing with the baggage of smaller institutions will be not be a fast or simple process.

If the USC women’s cross country team was looking for a burst of momentum heading into the last month of the season, it found it Saturday at the Vanguard Invitational in Costa Mesa, Calif.
The Women of Troy had by far their best race as a team thus far this season, winning the meet with a season-best 47 points, 27 better than second-place Orange Coast College. Rounding out the top-10 team finishers were Concordia, Point Loma, host Vanguard, Cal State Los Angeles, Westmont, Cal State Fullerton, Loyola Marymount and the Master’s College.
The win was the first for the Women of Troy this season.
With the looming Pac-10 Championships and with a disappointing finish at the Stanford Invitational still in their minds, USC desperately needed a breakout team performance. The Women of Troy did not disappoint. USC’s five scoring runners finished with an average 5K time of 18:23.80, and the top seven runners all finished in the top-20 overall.
Junior Zsofia Erdelyi led the way for USC, placing fourth overall with a time of 18:05. Junior Christine Cortez finished eigth overall, followed by senior Katherine Ellis (ninth overall), senior captain Bridget Helgerson (14th) and junior Zara Lukens (17th). Freshman Kelly Owen (19th overall) and sophomore Leah Gaeta (20th) rounded out the top-7 for USC.
Erdelyi’s performance was especially impressive. The junior had battled injuries and the flu before and during the season before Saturday’s strong fourth place finish.
Helgerson, too, experienced a slow start to the season due to injuries and slightly sub-par performances. The team captain came back in a big way Saturday, finishing with a time of 18:33, averaging just less than six minutes per mile.
Next up for the Women of Troy is the 6K Cal State Northridge Invitational on Oct. 16. The Women of Troy will look to build on Saturday’s strong performance and begin the drive towards the team’s ultimate goal: the Pac-10 Championships in Long Beach on Oct. 30.

At an Ingrid Michaelson concert, you can’t help but feel like that’s one of us up there.
“Damn, I ate a peanut butter-banana sandwich like thirty minutes ago, and now it’s clumping up in my throat,” she admitted after her first song of the night. “I could taste it as I sing.”
Her self-deprecating humor and modest aura makes you forget that you paid 35 bucks and drove 20 miles to see her. As you sink into the night, more and more you see her as your good old friend Ingrid and less as the Ingrid Michaelson whose songs have been featured on numerous movies and TV shows more times than you can count with your fingers.
She seems like one of us, but she’s still the coolest person you’d ever know.
Both her shows on Tuesday and Wednesday in West Hollywood’s legendary Troubadour were sold out weeks in advance. In fact, her entire American tour, which started at the end of August, has been sold out up to this point. The 29-year-old singer-songwriter, who hails from Staten Island, NY, is the newest sensation — she’s the only one who just doesn’t seem to know it.
With her dainty signature ukulele strapped across her torso, Michaelson — along with a complete five-piece band — kicked off the night with “Soldier,” the upbeat first track of her newest album Everybody.
Now, about this band of hers. If Michaelson feels like a good long-time friend at the end of the night, her five band-mates feel like your extended family—goofy, fun, familiar and real.
With two girls on backup guitar and three guys on bass, drums and keyboard, it’s no wonder how they have so much fun up there. Including Michaelson, that’s three on three. The band seems like a musically talented variation of the Friends cast —except spicier. The boys call themselves the ‘Men Squad’ and the girls call themselves the ‘Vag Force.’ In an incredibly off-tangent moment, each group even sang us their chant — with three-part harmonies and everything.
That’s the thing about Michaelson and her crew. Everything seems so effortless, spontaneous and real. They make the audience feel like a part of their funny little family, at least just for one night.
By the second song, everyone in the audience was belting the tunes along, and by the middle of the night after mix-match of both new and familiar songs, the audience was doing choreographed hand motions — complete with jazz hands.
There was also stomping, clapping, howling, what have you, while the band unleashed their energy on tambourines, cowbells, an electric drum set — and of course — looping.
Any fan of Michaelson would know this to be the main element to her songs. Using this process of looping fragments of her song over one another, she creates a perfect harmony between passion and serenity.
She achieved this same effect live to utmost perfection Wednesday night with Allie and Bess on back-up vocals. A highlight of this effect was during “The Chain” from her new record when the vocal build-up of the loops simultaneously drew strong emotions of passion, excitement and liberation.
As for the encore, she and her band defied tradition as per usual and cooked up something spicy again: a song about Mexican cuisine.
That’s the thing about Ingrid. She can make your heart wrench with the realness of her music and, almost right away, make you cry from laughter.
Oh, that is just so Ingrid.

Maybe it’s because I haven’t worked in many offices in my 20 years. Or maybe it’s because movies like Jerry Maguire fooled me into believing that every employee’s farewell is public and theatrical.
It turns out I was wrong on both counts. In fact, there wasn’t so much as a memo, quick phone call or brief email notifying the staff of an employee’s departure.
So when my co-workers began disappearing without explanation, I was confused, to say the least. What I initially assumed to be a couple sick days here and there turned into full-fledged mysteries of permanent absence that drove me to break out my trench coat and magnifying glass. All too often, the search for well-substantiated evidence behind these cases of backdoor exits ended fruitlessly.
The most perplexing of all disappearances involved one of my dearest co-workers, whom we’ll call Joe College, for he was the only other university student at the law firm. From the get-go, Joe College had a spotty attendance record: After his first day of work, he didn’t show up the next three days. When he returned the following Monday, he made no mention of a weekend getaway or family emergency that might have justified a lengthy absence for a newcomer.
When Joe College managed to make it into work, he would stay late to do one of the P-90x workout DVDs that were quite popular with my co-workers. In one casual lunch conversation, he suggested I work out at the office gym at 5 p.m. to avoid rush hour traffic.
While I was changing into my gym clothes, I realized I had forgotten socks. I felt like I should give him a heads-up and admitted to my inadequate footwear. He laughed and told me not to worry, so I carried on with my workout.
Fifteen minutes into the workout, Joe left suddenly without saying or waving goodbye as he usually did. Being the neurotic person I am, I automatically assumed he left to escape the offensive stench emanating from my sockless feet.
When he didn’t show up for work the next day, I realized that there was no way my sweaty feet were to blame for his ongoing truancy problem. Days turned into weeks and other people, even those who worked on different floors, started wondering what happened to “that guy” (he wasn’t even around long enough for people to commit his name to memory). If anyone dared to inquire about the missing person, Human Resources would offer a vague response — something about him being under the weather but nothing too serious, of course.
One of my favorite rough-around-the-edges secretary was convinced he had soiled his pants that day at the company gym and was too humiliated to ever show his face again. Did he quit? Was he fired? Was he too sick to come back? All we know is that he wasn’t too sick to deny my friend request on Facebook.
During my penultimate week at the law firm, the aforementioned secretary was fired. This, however, was less shocking because her in-office conduct teetered on unprofessional and disobedient.
I waved goodbye to her on a Monday evening, and the following Tuesday morning I saw Human Resources cleaning off her desk. At first, I thought they were disinfecting the area because she had recently been sick. But when I noticed people carrying boxes of files out of her cubicle, I knew she was a goner. As secretaries in the neighboring cubicles craned their necks to get a look at the move-out process that was well underway, rumors started circulating.
From here on, I will refer to her as “Megan Fox,” not because she was a megawatt hottie with acting chops, but because she was the proud owner of 13 tattoos and a mouth fit for a sailor.
There were a million reasons Megan Fox should have been fired before — wearing a denim skirt with a much-too-high slit, screaming matches with co-workers and engaging in frequent, uninhibited chitchat of a sexual nature. In spite of all of this, she was a good secretary.
And I, the lowly file clerk, wasn’t the only one who didn’t receive confirmation as to which of her many violations acted as the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. Even the attorneys she worked for were unsure as to what, after two years of misbehavior, finally gave Human Resources the push it needed to issue a pink slip to Megan Fox.
Offices often put forth considerable effort in greeting new employees by giving them individual tours of the workspace and hosting a meet-and-greet breakfast so the newbies can mingle with the old-timers.
Why then are their departures — voluntary or otherwise — swept under the rug? Surely not to respect the dearly departed’s privacy; not providing co-workers with a legitimate reason only gives way to gossip and worst-case scenario explanations. And if it’s to make the administration look better — to highlight the good and gloss over the bad — then they could use a grade-school reminder that honesty is the best policy.
That’s not to say co-workers deserve a detailed explanation of why a person was let go — in fact, that’s probably protected as confidential by law. A simple “So-and-so is no longer with the firm” would do just fine.
In the case of Under Wraps v. Out in the Open, it is the judgment of this columnist that a company should be sentenced to a lifetime of embittered office personnel should they choose to disguise, rather than disclose, any and all employment decisions.
