Thirty hours following President Joe Biden’s oath of office, the Center for Political Future welcomed USC students, faculty and staff for a conversation about the 59th Presidential Inauguration and a look at the months and years ahead for the Biden administration and the country. 
For the event, CPF welcomed its Spring 2021 Fellows — former Rep. Barbra Comstock, Crooked Media’s Shaniqua McClendon, and veteran journalist Todd S. Purdum — as panelists Thursday evening for a conversation with over 120 members of the Trojan community.
Moderated by veteran political strategists and CPF Director Bob Shrum and Co-Director Mike Murphy, panelists discussed pertinent topics including the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and the impending impeachment trial.
The moderators first opened the discussion by embracing the civility of yesterday’s inauguration, harboring on the hope it provided for the political future of the United States.
“Yesterday, during the inauguration, just to see the contrast of what happened exactly two weeks ago was symbolic of where our country is going,” McClendon said. “We had just left this really dangerous, chaotic time, hopefully behind us. I think we’re still gonna see some remnants of it, but we really got to turn the page and see a new type of leadership that would never provoke that type of behavior against our government.”
The insurrection at the Capitol proved a prominent topic for discussion, as panelists reflected on the sanctity of both the House and Senate floor, the violations made to the space Jan. 6th, and the uneasiness panelists shared in the moments leading up to the insurrection.
“On January 6, I realized just how much we had been dealing with, and that there was still more to come,” McClendon said. On that day I remember waking up — Jon Ossoff, and Raphael Warnock had just won their races in Georgia — and I thought that day would be a really exciting day and there might be some shenanigans on the hill with trying to overturn the election but what ultimately happened was a mob of people tried to unsuccessfully overthrow government. It just brought me back into the reality of what we had been living through for the past four years.
McClendon and Comstock both noted their own experiences as congressional staffers and shared the rarity of a staffer appearing on the floor. Comstock also expressed disdain for the gross violation former President Donald Trump committed to the presidential office by encouraging “monsters” to disrupt and wreak havoc on the joint Congressional session. 
While Biden once again denounced the acts of the insurrectionists and the violence that took place during the previous administration in his inaugural address, he will, however, have no choice in picking right up where the Trump Administration left off on tackling the ongoing pandemic.
Comstock also shared her hope for centrist support on coronavirus relief legislation with audience members. Naming Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins as people Biden can “turn to to govern.” In contrast, Purdum refuted the idealistic centrist support, noting that Biden has “his work cut out for him.”
“I think that’s really the challenge, strike at [coronavirus] first, and then they will have to deal with Impeachment,” Purdum said.
Impeachment remained at the forefront of the panelists’ minds throughout the event, with Comstock commenting, “If this isn’t impeachable, what is?” McClendon added, “The first step is holding Donald Trump accountable.” Panelists also discussed the potential pushed date of the former president’s impeachment to early February following a recent report from The New York Times. 
Aside from the insurrection, impeachment and the coronavirus, CPF panelists took time to celebrate yesterday’s events: Biden became the 46th President of the United States, Vice President Kamala Harris became the first woman, person of African American descent and person of South Asian descent to hold the vice presidency, as well as the performance of the youngest ever inaugural poet, Amanda Gorman.
“[The inauguration] was such a contrast to what we had seen the weeks prior, that it said a lot about American resiliency,” said Kamy Akhavan, executive director of CPF. “One of the points tonight that was made, Barbra Comstock made the point, she says, ‘So many people talk about the fragility of democracy,’ and that demonstration of contrasts, to her, reflected American resilience and strength.”
With about 40 events lined up for the spring semester, CPF looks to use future events as a way to reflect on what is of importance to the USC community and the world, according to Akhavan.
“We want USC students to feel national politics from the front row,” Akhavan said. “So we bring the national stage to everyone’s living rooms, because we can and we should. We want people to have a strong interest in politics; we want them to feel like politics is for them and we want them to feel like politics is of such an interest that maybe they want to get involved in it it, that maybe they want to work for a political office or work for a government agency or work in advocacy somehow. We want to inspire them and train them and the programs, like the one we held tonight, are a really important part of that.”

After 20 years of civil rights advocacy work with detained migrants, police accountability and unhoused rights by political science professor Olu Orange and his USC Mock Trial program, Dornsife Associate Dean of Experiential Learning Tammy Anderson reached out to Orange to expand his work. Together, they worked to create an experiential learning program with a civil rights focus offered through the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences. 
Agents of Change, Dornsife’s new civil rights undergraduate clinic, looks to engage students in civil rights advocacy, community activism and governmental policy. Recently launched in Spring 2021, the two-year program allows students to attend specialized education modules and work alongside community partners including Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles, ACLU SoCal, Al Otro Lado, Colors of Change and over 30 other civil rights advocacy groups.
According to Orange, Agents of Change will work with their community partners to assist those facing unfair circumstances such as immigration, racial, employment or law enforcement issues.
“When you look out, particularly in light of recent events politically as well as the global pandemic, there are people suffering tremendously,” Orange said. “We need more people out there fighting for fairness for people in the community who need help.”
The program also aims to provide students with paid opportunities to become involved in civil rights fieldwork. For this reason, the program offers a $1,000 monthly stipend to support students who might work their way through school and otherwise wouldn’t have been able to participate. 
“What I have found is that very few Black and brown students get involved in these programs because they often are spending so much time working just to pay bills and be able to have somewhere to live and food to eat while also attending USC, which is extraordinarily expensive,” said Orange.
Agents of Change program assistant Mariah Breit, who has worked multiple jobs throughout her college career to financially support herself, said the stipend was necessary for the program to be accessible to all students.
“I’ve had to turn down opportunities because they’re unpaid, and I knew that I wouldn’t be able to have the time to do that [unpaid] opportunity and still work,” said Breit, a senior majoring in business administration. “I thought about all the students that may be in that same position when looking at Agents of Change and wanting to join the program but also concerned with how they’re going to work and pay their bills.”
Last fall, students interested in Agents of Change submitted short essay answers on collaboration, problem solving and issues that personally affect them. Program Manager Kath Rogers, said the program welcomed 12 undergraduate students to do work on campaigns and projects in the community. 
“I think what’s really unique about Agents of Change is that it’s linking the classroom to the community — and not just talking about justice issues but actually having students work alongside community members who are fighting for their own rights,” Rogers said.
In addition to virtual fieldwork, students this semester will also engage in coordinated education modules and courses in which they will discuss current civil rights topics including social movements, lawsuits, budgets and campaigns. Rogers also said the program plans to invite activists as guest speakers for the course.
“We learn through history books in a lot of different ways,” Rogers said. “But to have guest speakers and to have these kinds of lived experiences and learning tools in the classroom and also have students learning from their own hands on experience is really unique.”
Throughout the course of the program, students will rotate and engage through various community partners specializing in legal, governmental and communal activism, such as the California Governor’s Office and the Los Angeles Office of Civil and Human Rights. 
Katherine Owojori, a sophomore majoring in political science, will be working with Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles this semester. Owojori said Agents of Change will allow her to immerse herself into the world of civil rights and political reform and experience new environments without the worry of having an internship lined up for each semester. 
“I look forward to finding out ways that I can help on a more grand scale,” Owojori said. “With all of the social justice reform that began this summer, I constantly felt like I couldn’t do anything and that finding petitions and then educating people was one thing, but I always felt that I should be able to do more. What I’m excited about is to be able to be a part of what Black Lives Matter wishes to accomplish in a real way.”
Alyssa Matias, a member of Agents of Change working with ACLU SoCal, said the program is imperative to showing undergraduate students that they have power to enact change in their communities.
“It is extremely important that not just USC, but all universities follow in our footsteps and make sure that there’s a platform for undergraduate students to be not just civically engaged but engaged in pursuing social justice, racial justice and economic justice,” said Matias, a sophomore majoring in political science.  “Universities across the country have to be active in pursuing that because there’s just too much going on for people to just sit back and let other people decide things for them.”

With a new semester beginning, new shows and movies will be a perfect break in routine from classes. Whether you like period dramas, comedy, animation or all three, there is bound to be something for everyone to check out this month. You may just find your new guilty pleasure series or get hooked on a stand-alone movie that leaves you wanting for more.
Netflix
“Bridgerton”
Content Warning: Episode 6 of “Bridgerton” contains references to sexual assault. 
“Bridgerton” proves that regardless of the time, drama is always present. The show is set in the Regency era and plays into every ballroom-filled fantasy a person could have. The modern storytelling gives the viewer the impression that the Bridgerton family acts quite similar to the Upper East Side socialites found in contemporary dramas like “Gossip Girl.” The show opens on the higher regalty initiating arranged marriages for the single members of the family. Soon after, drama erupts when suitors are deemed inadequate for the eligible bachelorettes. This leads to learning more about each member of the family, their scandals and their traumas. It’s difficult to provide more detail about the series because spoilers arrive within the first episode, but if the regal world interests you even a little bit, this show is worth checking out. 
USC alumna Shonda Rhimes serves as one of the executive producers, which makes this recommendation extra special. Rhimes, alongside her co-executive producers,  decided to cast a diverse group of actors to play parts that have been historically reserved in period pieces by white actors.
“Big Mouth”
The fourth season of Netflix’s original animated comedy arrived over winter break, and it did not disappoint long-time fans. Existing characters Nick Birch (Nick Kroll), Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney), Jay Bilzerian (Jason Mantzoukas), Missy Missy Foreman-Greenwald (Ayo Edebiri) and Jessi Glaser (Jessi Klein) continue navigating middle school and puberty together with the help of their hormone monsters and, at times, their parents. One new character, Tito the Anxiety Mosquito (Maria Bamford), antagonizes the group of friends while providing the viewer with a representation of how anxiety can manifest differently for every person. When looking beyond the raunchy, middle-school-level comedic moments, the viewer is able to learn a bit more about themselves through the successes and failures each character has.
HBO Max
“Wonder Woman 1984”
Leaving HBO Max Jan. 24, this made-for-theater blockbuster got the straight-to-DVD treatment due to the pandemic. The film follows Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) in 1984 as she leads a double life working at the Smithsonian as her day job and fighting crime when it arises as Wonder Woman. Her coworker, Barbara Ann Minerva (Kristen Wiig), becomes envious of the attention Prince garners and, acting on desperation, wishes on a stone to be like her. The stone, however, unleashes a new wave of evil as villain Max Lord (Pedro Pascal) arrives to use the stone’s power for his benefit. As the over two hour film plays out, viewers can only hope to see a blockbuster of this caliber in theaters again soon.
“King of Staten Island”
“SNL” star Pete Davidson stars in this comedy-drama loosely based on his own life. Scott Carlin, the main character, is a 20-something-year-old who is floundering with no direction for his life. After experiencing his father’s death at a young age, Scott, his sister and their mother are left to navigate life without him. 
Years later, after his sister has left for college, Scott’s mom begins to start over again by finding a new boyfriend and changing the house against Scott’s will. Although their team dynamic falters, in the end both Scott and his mom realize the importance of keeping one another close. The film is a treat for both super fans of Pete Davidson and those who are unfamiliar with his life.
Disney+
“Soul”
Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) and 22 (Tina Fey) are an unlikely yet powerhouse duo in the latest Pixar film, “Soul.” Gardner is a middle school music teacher who loses his drive to teach as he realizes he has always wanted to perform. As things start to go his way, he finds himself in the Great Beyond, Pixar’s version of the afterlife, where he meets 22. Their envisioning of what the afterlife looks like is comforting for the viewer but is not paradise for Gardner. Gardner and 22 team up to fulfill the other’s desires to go to Earth, yet, they are in direct violation of what the Great Beyond requires them to do. As they spend time together, it becomes evident that both characters are about as different as can be. Still, their high jinks allow them to learn from one another the importance of appreciating what life has to offer.
“Wandavision”
Set directly after “Avengers: Endgame,” this television show follows the life of superheroes Vision (Paul Bettany) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) as they adjust to life in American suburbia. Their adjustment seems to be going fairly well as Vision settles into his job and Wanda plays the role of housewife quite well. As they learn more about themselves since they don’t know their own backstory, their progress slows. It is unclear what the show’s long-term plot will be since only the first two episodes have been released so far and seem to be set in two distinct decades. A full season is set to roll out in the coming months. 
Aside from the story captivating Marvel fans, this show has the potential to be a turning point for the Marvel Cinematic Universe as this may be emblematic of further made-for-television episodic efforts over films. That’s only speculation currently, but it is something interesting to consider given the pandemic’s impact on the movie industry and theaters specifically.
Amazon Prime Video
“One Night in Miami”
“One Night in Miami” serves as Regina King’s directorial debut. Although fiction, the film provides a look into what might occur in a meeting between Muhammed Ali (Eli Goree), Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.) and Malcom X (Kingsley Ben-Adir). Their conversation revolves around each of their unique and significant roles in the civil rights movement. The realizations that occur between the men throughout the film make it difficult to believe it only took place during one meeting one night. Each man’s personal turmoil influences how he interacts with the others and what he expects of them moving forward.

Settling is not a word in Lila Forde’s vocabulary; she won’t settle on a genre and won’t settle for mediocre. The 22-year-old gifted artist and senior majoring in music released her new EP, “In Another Life,” on Jan. 15. 
“In Another Life” strings six dreamy tunes together culminating in a “protagonist of an indie movie” fantasy. Forde describes her own sound as jazz with a pop sensibility. 
“It’s really groove-based,” Forde said. “It’s harmony-heavy like a complex jazz harmony but not super intellectual heady cerebral like jazz can often be.” 
The EP’s opening song immediately shows off Forde’s innate ability to play with the rules. A cacophony of angelic sopranos whistles the listener into a unique rollercoaster of sound. 
“Get in your body,” Forde said. “Don’t think too much; just put it on and let it take you where it’s going to take you. The goal of this record is to take people wherever they want to go in their moments in their everyday lives.” 
The Seattle native was born into music. Her mother is a classical pianist, and music has been a pillar in her life since day one. 
“In high school, I started getting really into jazz, playing a lot of jazz and meeting new people,” Forde said. “I knew that I wanted to pursue music in college; there wasn’t anything else, and there was nothing else that felt natural to me.” 
Forde has thrived at USC and has enjoyed the faculty’s guidance immensely. 
“I came to USC knowing that my voice, and my original style was in me somewhere, but I hadn’t really discovered it or developed it yet,” Forde said. “I’ve grown so much. Looking back on when I was a freshman, I have learned from so many professors and my peers as well.” 
Forde was a member of USC Thorton’s Afro-Latin American Jazz ensemble her junior year where she met professor Aaron Serfaty. The ensemble includes a horn, rhythm, bass and percussion sections. Forde was one of the vocalists in the chorus. After working together, Serfaty and Forde now have a close student-teacher bond.
“It’s a different genre and realm of rhythmic and musical vocabulary that I really wasn’t used to,” Forde said. “Aaron is a really special teacher, and he really pushes you and I feel like I got so much out of that ensemble, even though I’m still scratching the surface of what I can learn from that type of music. That class really influenced how I write, how I play and how I listen.”
Serfaty noted Forde is a brilliant student, and he was dazzled by her abilities. On one occasion, Serfaty let Forde lead the class and was highly impressed with her talent to communicate with the band. 
“She was very effective directing the band,” Serfaty said. “[That’s] not common. She has a very clear vision of what she wants the music to sound like, and she’s able to communicate it very clearly to the band. I wasn’t able to do that until I was in my 30s.”
During his time teaching music at the Thornton School of Music, Serfaty is continuously amazed by the level of talent he gets to teach. 
“The level of talent that we’re attracting keeps getting better and better,” Serfaty said. “They keep me on my toes. I have to be ready for them because they’re really fantastic. Lila is an absolute standout from her class.” 
Serfaty played percussion on track four of “In Another Life,” “Woah (Song For You),” a masterful tribute to the art of percussion. Forde’s silk and buttery vocals combined with a striking sound of Serfaty’s playing. The song even includes a moment of graceful smooth jazz pause. 
“My opinion [on the EP] is really biased because I love her. I have been listening to these tunes for a while,” Serfaty said. “It’s wonderful! She worked with another student of mine, Spencer Lemann and he’s fantastic as well.”
Spencer Lemann, a senior in the USC Thornton jazz studies program, met Forde in a freshman music theory class. The two now live together with a crop of various Thornton classmates. After being friends and roommates, the duo now click and work together well.
Lemann and Forde write together often, and he helped engineer and produce her EP. Lemann has a studio set up in his room and the two began recording during the beginning of the pandemic. 
“Having such a talented buddy of mine trust me to translate her vision of her music up to this point into a product it’s just really amazing,” Lemann said. “I really thank Lila for the opportunity to work with her on it.”
Beyond being friends, Lemann enjoys Forde’s work as an artist. 
“What I look for in music, generally, is honesty,” Lemann said. “I think Lila’s music is very honest. Nothing is contrived. She puts a lot of attention into arrangement and lyric choices. She’s not bending her ideas or accessibility. It’s just truly expressive music.” 
After creating the EP, Forde has moved on musically and artistically evolved. 
“Since I released the EP, I was like, ‘Oh these songs are good and people do love these songs,’” Forde said. “Even though I’m not necessarily in the same place I was when I wrote them.” 
“In Another Life” is currently available to stream everywhere and for sale on Bandcamp.

Something significant and noteworthy happened recently in South Los Angeles. Richard Earl Shelton passed away on Dec. 14, 2020 at the age of 86. During a global pandemic in which hundreds of thousands have lost their lives in the United States and in Los Angeles, this may not seem significant or noteworthy. However, for the Jefferson Park neighborhood near USC, this was a major loss. For you see Richard Shelton or “Pops,” as he was affectionately known, was the proprietor and owner of Shelton’s Barber Shop.  
Richard Earl Shelton was born on Oct. 8, 1934 in Brenham, Texas. After graduating from high school, he moved to Los Angeles. He attended barber college and became a licensed barber in 1956. He began serving in the United States Army in 1957 and later received an honorable discharge. Richard attended night classes at Los Angeles Trade Technical College where he earned an associate degree in accounting.
In 1962, Richard opened Shelton’s Barber Shop on Washington Boulevard and 7th Avenue. The shop relocated to the corner of Western and Jefferson in 1969 and eventually to Vermont and Adams in 1997. Richard was raised in a God-fearing home and was a member of Trinity Baptist Church.
I first met Mr. Shelton when I entered USC as a 17-year-old freshman in the fall of 1981. I needed a place to get my hair cut, and Shelton’s was the go-to place for African American students at USC. Pops occupied the first chair in the shop. He welcomed every person, set the tone and was the gatekeeper who decided what was acceptable or not in the lives of those who entered.
Every time I went there while at USC, he would greet me and ask me how school was going. I always felt the pride in his voice when he would speak to me. For someone away from home at a university with very few Black students (less than 1% of all students), it meant a lot. For African American men at USC, Shelton’s was a place where we could connect with the local community and our culture. I always felt at home at Shelton’s.
For the first few years, I called him Mr. Shelton to give him the respect he deserved. Over the years as I got to know him, he became Pops. To me he was the African American version of James Bond. He had movie-star good looks and had “much game” and was “smooth” as we say in the Black community. 
Pops had a wonderful soul. He had all the attributes of a role model – smart, confident, trustworthy, integrity, kindness, compassion, patience, strength and tenderness. He was a man’s man and there was no pretense or fakeness about him. He was God-fearing as well as a great friend, mentor, counselor and teacher to all with whom he came in contact. 
He was a loving and caring father figure not only to his family but to all in the community. He would give the shirt off his back and help you in any way he could. He is responsible for helping and keeping many people in the neighborhood from going down the wrong path. He was one of the first successful Black businessmen and entrepreneurs I ever saw.
Quite simply, he was a father to the South Los Angeles community around USC and Jefferson Park. It is a misconception that we don’t have any male role-models in the African American community. Pops was the epitome of what an African American man should be. Not perfect, but always striving to be better each day. Simply put, he was a great man.
As most know in the Black community, a barbershop is much more than a place where you get your haircut. It is a community center, shopping center, newsroom, bully pulpit, a place of spirituality, support, education, tolerance, social justice, understanding, humor and love. It is one of the few places in the United States where African American men can maintain their respect and dignity. Simply put, an African American barbershop is a weigh station that educates African American men. 
You see every part of the community in an African American barbershop — both good and bad. It is a place where the most successful to the most in need and everything in between come. It is where African American men learn what a Black man is, should be and should not be. No one disrespects the barbershop. It is sovereign ground in the African American community.
Many sons have graduated from Shelton’s Barber Shop on their way to doing great things in Los Angeles, the United States and the world. I am a proud alumnus of Shelton’s Barber Shop and of the Richard Earl Shelton Life Academy. 
This loss may not seem like much in the context of a global pandemic, but South Los Angeles has lost one of its patriarchs. Perhaps the real point is that every single person who has lost their life during this pandemic is significant within their sphere of influence.
Richard Earl Shelton’s sphere of influence was enormous as it includes every person who entered the door of Shelton’s Barber Shop. Pops sprinkled us all with “game” so that we could further his legacy. Shelton’s Barber Shop is now in the capable hands of his son, Randy Shelton, and I now bring my son there for his education.

As everyone does, I had my heroes growing up. I was enamored by strong, resilient women, and I looked up to them with aspirations of one day reaching their heights of success. 
My mom was and will forever be one of the most prominent paradigms for the person I aspire to be. We came here from the Philippines together, but she has taught me so much about what it means to be an immigrant woman in the United States. Her selflessness knows no bounds, and her outlook is filled with unfailing hope. As a young woman only a few years older than I am now, she left behind career, family and all that she knew because she believed in the quality and promise of the American dream. 
From one daughter of immigrants to another, Vice President Kamala Harris’ words on Nov. 7 reverberated within my chest, speaking to our shared experience of being raised by the strongest women this country has the pleasure of knowing. 
In her first address as then vice president-elect, Harris spoke about her mom. She spoke of what it’s like to be raised in an immigrant household where dreams are a true and powerful commodity; for many, her words were fuel to chase dreams and motivation to leap through doors we once thought to be sealed shut. It matters that we have a greater immigrant presence in our public offices, and it matters especially to the youth of this nation watching individuals who look, think and sound like them fill positions of high esteem. 
On Nov. 7, it was never more true to me that a picture can speak a thousand words. Instagram was filled with parents capturing the moment their young children saw a Black and Asian American woman assume a role typically reserved for the wealthy, white man. The youth of the United States knew, just as we did, that history was being made right before our eyes and on the faces of the young girls of color, I recognized that flicker of hope and aspiration. 
It was a moment of reverent realization: It is possible to reach heights unknown, even from further back in the race. 
Months ago, I wrote with an anxious heart and trembling hands, not knowing what the future might hold. My fear was of continued xenophobia and the sharp, condemning rhetoric that foreign peoples in the United States were met with under the guise of nationalism these past four years. While the election of more diverse leaders does not even begin to bridge the gaps or bring about the change this nation needs, it is unmistakably a step toward more accurate representation. 
It matters that we have in office the most diverse, inclusive Congress ever to be seen in this country. According to data journalist Katharina Buchholz, Sen. Raphael Warnock’s latest victory in Georgia accounted for 137 members of Congress who self-identified as people of color, making the 117th U.S. Congress record-breaking for its slow climbing path to greater diversity. 
The election of more women of diverse backgrounds has also broken barriers in the past year. Elected leaders such as  Reps. Cori Bush, Marilyn Strickland, Deb Haaland and Teresa Leger Fernandez add to the ranks of women of color in Congress, and their seats are significant for bringing in the voices of more historically-marginalized groups. 
In the 116th U.S. Congress of the past year, the Pew Research Center reported that 13% of Congressional members were immigrants or were raised in an immigrant household. Among them, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Tom Malinowski of New Jersey are immigrants themselves, escaping political turmoil in Somalia and Poland respectively.  
These figures are critical for allowing the next generation’s leaders to see themselves and feel represented by their elected officials. Beyond this, it is only right to have policy dictated by those that have walked in the shoes of their constituents.
Politics aside, Harris’ background brings promise for a new age of what immigrants can achieve in this world. For so long, it has been unfathomable to do what she did. As the daughter of Shyamala Gopalan Harris, an immigrant from India, and Donald Harris, an immigrant from Jamaica, Harris brought up the label of the hyphenated American to be attributed to triumph despite the significant push back. 
As my mother’s daughter, I hope to make use of my mother’s great sacrifices and find my own path to achievement, because there is power to be found in where I come from and from the wellspring of strength that I was raised by. 
What I have learned in this landmark of history is that “a daughter of immigrants” is a label of rich history and potential, not a place of shame or disability. We are our mother’s daughters in that.
