University President C. L. Max Nikias believes that the limited data recently released by the Department of Education on their college “scorecard” website does not paint a full picture of USC.
The new government-sponsored site features statistics on over 7,000 U.S. higher education institutions. It allows future college students the opportunity to sort and compare schools based on statistics such as graduation rate, school size and average financial aid benefits.
Nikias expressed his concern for the website’s focus on quantifiable factors.
“The College Scorecard metrics such as cost, access and outcomes are surely an important part of the consideration,” Nikias said, “But they do not fully take into account the academic quality of an institution as reflected in the quality of the faculty, students and curriculum. And it is these factors that have and will continue to guide USC’s academic mission.”
President Barack Obama abandoned his initial effort to create a rating system for colleges in the United States. Under the original idea, all institutions of higher education would be assigned a ranking based on average student debt and post-graduation earning potential. Additionally, it would have been possible for colleges with low rankings to lose access to the billions of federal student aid dollars.
Despite the lack of ratings on the new website, it still allows students and parents to compare schools based on relevant measurements. For example, students can filter schools based on average annual costs, graduation rates above 75 percent and average salaries after graduation of more than $50,000 per year.
Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath said there is a need for greater transparency at institutions of higher education.
“I believe the new college scorecard is an innovative way to hold universities accountable for their actions,” she said. “When I was on a call with the White House earlier this summer, I brought up the need for governmental oversight of private institutions. We need some type of governmental support in our advocacy for greater accountability for spending at private universities like USC.”
Sampath also mentioned that the newly consolidated data might not only help families explore affordable options, but also push colleges to focus on quality of education before profit. She said the realization that the government is keeping an eye on institutions like USC could potentially lead to future efforts to make education affordable and more worthwhile.
“Students have emailed me saying they feel hopeless about their financial situation and continuing their education,” Sampath said. “There are students who work two to three jobs, skip meals, start GoFundMe’s and go sleepless in order to put themselves through school. That’s an embarrassment. I believe this college scorecard is one step forward in the larger picture of the government putting the pressure on universities to stop acting like for-profit businesses.”
Since the website’s release, colleges and universities have called the quality of the 171 megabytes of data into question. The American Council on Education expressed its concern about the Department of Education compiling data without comprehensive external review.

“Nikias expressed his concern for the website’s focus on quantifiable factors,” yet that’s exactly the information “consumers” need to make an informed financial decision. I’m all for hard data. Also, as elite colleges such as Stanford continue to make affordability a priority, and as student debt is a current hot political issue, Nikias might need to adjust his philosophy accordingly.

Tuesday night at the Undergraduate Student Government Senate meeting, USG President Rini Sampath touched once again on the issue of college affordability.
Sampath, alongside Rachel Thundat, senior director of communications, described how USG recently launched a survey addressing the issue.
“We released a survey along with a Facebook post with a graphic of tuition over the past 50 years or so,” Thundat said. “It shows that [tuition] in 1950 was really low and then increasing and increasing every year. And even since we were freshmen, [I’m a senior now and] it has gone up $6,000, which I personally had no idea about. It is crazy.”
Thundat said that the post was a total success.
“That post got over 36,000 people reached, which was an anomaly,” Thundat said. “It was shared over 100 times, and the post was liked over 300 times. This was huge, probably one of the biggest things we’ve done yet.”
A typical USG Facebook post, Thundat and Sampath said, reaches anywhere from 2,000-5,000 people and gets 25 to 100 likes. This post’s numbers were about six times that.
Sampath also remarked how one of the comments in the post’s comment section said, “If you are looking to get out of this with the smallest amount of money paid, maybe you should transfer to UCLA.”
“This comment reflects a lack of empathy of some of our peers for other students,” Sampath said. “It blows my mind that someone could just dismiss another person’s struggles and hardships and say, ‘You should’ve known what you were getting yourself into when you signed up for a private school.’”
Sampath also said that reaching administrators on the topic of affordability can be an uphill battle.
“There comes a point where you wonder if people are losing their humanity while they are considering some of these decisions,” Sampath said. “It startles me that I just can’t come up to an administrator and say, ‘Look, this student emailed me and feels hopeless because of his financial situation at USC,’ and have that strike a cord.”
Luis Vidalon-Susuki, director of EdMonth, a month-long program that aims to raise awareness on the state of education in America, agreed. Alongside Sampath, he conducted a survey asking students to share their college affordability stories. He said that we are facing a dire situation.
“I didn’t join USC to play partisan politics,” Vidalon-Susuki said. “Some of my friends are skipping meals to be able to pay for this tuition. I have two jobs, but some of my friends have more than that. I consider myself lucky to pay for USC, which is unbelievable … If we are really a Trojan Family, we should use some of the $6 billion we are fundraising right [now] to help our students.”
Sampath also commented on struggling students.
“There are students who are responding anonymously to the survey describing that they are skipping meals,” Sampath said. “And it’s not just skipping meals. It can be everything from being sleepless at night to starting a GoFundMe page to telling your parents you can’t come home for this break because you have to work.”
Sampath explained that students cannot deal with mental health while also dealing with such a difficult financial situation.
“[College affordability] is a human rights issue on campus,” she said. “There is no governmental oversight for private institutions … and it gets out of hand that the private institutions’ tuition increases so exponentially whereas public institutions are putting tuition freezes.”
Furthermore, Sampath said that further tuition increases could severely damage the University’s multicultural diversity.
“If we continue to raise tuition, there are going to be communities, particularly communities of color, who won’t be able to go to school, and that is going to quite realistically whitewash our university,” Sampath said. “You’re gonna have the one percent of the population able to afford schools like USC, and USC is going to lose out on these remarkable, talented minds that come from communities that are not [well-represented.]”
Sampath mentioned her personal experience with the value of a college education.
“I speak having seen my father struggle … and knowing that my family wouldn’t be where they are if it weren’t for the education that my father earned,” she said. “I feel particularly proud to be the first one in my family to go to college in the United States, and I want others to have that same opportunity regardless of their financial background.”
Sampath is proposing to add a voting student member into the university’s Board of Trustees, the 55-member body that makes all the University’s key decisions.
“You can only do so much advocacy work and then suddenly it gets brushed under the rug once the next year’s leadership comes on board. So my question is, ‘How do we make this last over time?’”
Sampath talked about how public universities usually allow for a student member on their boards of trustees.
“We have such a closed-door model, [in which] everything is happening behind a curtain, and students have no idea what’s happening,” she said. “We write a check every year [and] we take out these loans, but there’s zero transparency on what is happening.”

World-renowned anthropologist and director of Lehman College’s Center for Human Rights and Peace Studies Victoria Sanford discussed her work in documenting the Guatemalan genocide at Doheny Library on Tuesday evening.
Hosted by the Shoah Foundation Center for Advanced Genocide Research, Sanford’s lecture highlighted possible ways to prevent and end genocide. Sanford also showed examples proving its existence.
As an American anthropologist who navigated the complicated social, cultural and historical terrain of post-Civil War Guatemala in order to successfully expose the massive human rights violations faced by indigenous Guatemalans, Sanford offered a detailed account of the means and methods needed to overcome the systematic extermination of a people.
“I’ve been working in Guatemala since 1990, and the first exhumation I worked on was in 1994,” said Sanford, whose books include Buried Secrets: Truth and Human Rights in Guatemala and La Masacre de Panzós: Etnicidad, Tierra Y Violencia En Guatemala.
“I never imagined that all these years later I would still be talking about it, but that’s how these international human rights cases tend to work.”
The exhumations Sanford referred to consisted of widespread archaeological digs around areas in Guatemala that had known massacres. Sanford showed photos of the skeletons, bullets and remaining artifacts found at the exhumation sites, describing the labor-intensive process needed to prevent a genocide’s occurrence.
“The exhumation has a lot of different parts. It has the archaeological exhumation. It has antemortem interviews, analysis of skeletal remains, lab work and a very important collection of survivor testimonies,” Sanford said.
The exhumations were manned partly by Sanford and her team but also by locals in the village. They pioneered the discoveries and documentations of the Guatemalan genocide, as many occurrences of massacres were unknown due to a lack of survivors. Yet some indigenous Guatemalans traveled across multiple villages to watch Sanford’s exhumations. After days of watching, they finally told Sanford that, in fact, their respective villages had also been massacred.
In cases without survivors, some massacres may have never been discovered. Sanford reminded  the audience that the survivors of the Guatemalan genocide did not emerge unscathed.
“What’s missing from this photo?” Sanford asked the audience, showing a picture of an adult couple, an elderly woman and a few young children. “There are no teenagers. All the babies who would’ve been teenagers at the time died during the massacres because there was no food and all the mothers’ milk dried up.”
Despite the magnitude of the tragedy of the genocide, exposing the truth impelled and sustained the excavations.
“When you do an exhumation, you become a part of the community’s cultural processes, and in Mayan cosmology, if you disturb the bones of the dead, you disturb their spirits,” Stanford said. “Each time we opened a grave, [the locals] would ask the ancestors to support us and ask the spirits not to be angry with us because we were helping to expose the truth.”
Former president and dictator Efraín Ríos Montt was eventually convicted of committing genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013. Current president Otto Fernando Pérez Molina, who actively participated in the genocide as well, has also been arrested and charged with corruption.
Sanford acknowledged that the genocide’s effect remains extensive, and her work is far from over.
“Guatemala has one of the highest femicide rates in the world,” Sanford said. “Today, two women in Guatemala are killed everyday.”
Sanford remains optimistic in her pursuit of justice and human rights.
“At least we know that [Pérez Molina] is off the street and out of power, and we’re hoping that there will be someone good in office next year,” Sanford said. “And really we’re hoping that whoever becomes president next year will know that they will not be able to get away with the kinds of things that [others] have in the past.”

After the sun beat down on us with no mercy last week, there are two must-have items you should make sure to take with you before walking out of the house this week: sunscreen and a water bottle. While walking back and forth between classes and being outside all day on game days, staying hydrated and out of the sun seems like an impossible task. Who wants to take the time to put on sunscreen in the morning? Those three minutes of sleep are precious, and I respect that. However, I also respect taking care of one’s skin health.
Though getting a golden tan seems like a great way to take advantage of the oppressive sun, it comes with many risks. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, the most prevalent cancer amongst 25 to 29 year olds is melanoma, caused by excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation. The best way to protect oneself is to apply sunscreen once every few hours. Alternatively, you could find a face moisturizer with at least SPF 30, as well as Chapstick or body lotion with at least SPF 30.
Take your skin protection game to the next level by throwing on a USC hat or sunglasses, because if you invest in school swag it might as well be protective too.
In addition to sporting sunscreen, staying hydrated is also vital. No one wants that nasty post-game day hangover because they forgot their water bottle. Keep that Camelbak or Nalgene handy. You can even refill them when you are at the Coliseum. Reusable water bottles will save you money and the hassle of waiting in lines at the concession stand. Instead, go straight for the drinking fountain before the game or in between quarters. It is truly an investment that pays for itself.
During classes, make sure to keep your water with you in a handy place. It’s a good idea to keep it in either that water bottle pocket in your backpack that would alternatively accumulate gum wrappers and receipts (or is that just me?), or on hand for that 10-minute walk or jog from KAP to VKC. With all the humidity and heat, you want to make sure to replenish your fluids.
It’s also important to maintain a healthy diet while combatting the heat — think five cups of fruits and veggies a day, tea or coffee, plenty of protein and lots of water. Being thirsty during class is the worst. With your water bottle in hand, you won’t have to sweat it.
As always, being a Trojan comes with the perk of getting non-stop sun year round, and with that privilege come certain responsibilities. Doing your best to stay out of direct sunlight, protecting yourself with sunscreen, eating well and hydrating are simply a few actions that can keep you at your best in this beautiful, sunny, pre-midterm football season portion of the first semester.
Fight on, stay healthy (and hydrated) and beat the Farm!

Sneakers, a hat, a watch, jeans and a light sweater are versatile enough to be worn all year with many different outfits. Samantha Kim | Daily Trojan
College often means studying, studying and more studying. It almost seems like there is no room to think about anything else other than classes. Nothing like friends, family and especially fashion. When rushing to get to class every morning because you overslept, how you look may be the last thing on your mind. You might often simply throw on the typical sweatshirt and jeans combo once again. However, looking cute for class, without breaking the bank, can be easy as long as you have a few closet essentials handy.
Closet must-haves for college are simple. They are staple items, so you will definitely get bang for your buck. Items include: a pair of sneakers, a hat, a watch, a pair of jeans and a light sweater. These are essentials for those who are seeking ease and style in their day-to-day wear for class.
Sneakers are a must, especially this season. While previously used for just working out, sneakers have become a huge trend this year — mainly due to their versatility. They come in an endless range of colors and, more importantly, are comfortable when constantly running through campus. I encourage you to invest in a good pair. Sneakers have flexibility in terms of what you wear them with, and they are a great way to look trendy all semester long.
As gross as this may sound, when in a morning rush washing your hair may not always be a top priority. Let’s be honest, I am not the only one who has skipped a wash here or there, and there will most likely be a few more slip ups as the year progresses. However, when on the way to class, and the day’s dry shampoo just isn’t enough, it is best to throw on a hat. Whether it be a fedora, baseball cap or beanie it has the ability to transform an unwashed head of hair into something a bit more presentable.
Watches have made a comeback in recent years as a hot fashion item. They have the ability to casually accessorize an outfit. Though many people wear watches more for their aesthetic qualities these days, a watch is an important classroom accessory. Sure, telling time can easily be done with one lift of a phone, but how many times do you also get distracted, failing to resist the temptation of also checking your messages or playing a game? Purchase a watch as a closet essential for class. It keeps you more productive and also adds a little flare to any outfit.
The fourth must-have item for college students is a good pair of jeans. Though this may seem so basic and ordinary, a good pair of jeans can change a lot about your day. A flattering fit and material can add comfort and ease while sitting long hours in class or making your way around campus. Think about flexibility when purchasing a good pair as they are an everyday staple.
The final college closet essential for looking cute in class is a lightweight sweater. Trade the baggy sweatshirt in for a well-fitting sweater. Since we are still in sunny California, I would still say to keep it thin so that you are not suffering in the smoldering heat. Throw it on over a tank top, over the shoulder, or even consider layering. The options are endless.
These pieces can look great separate or all together. Just remember, always being in class doesn’t mean you have to constantly sacrifice your wardrobe.

From a young age, we learn how important connections with others are. When we were little, we’d come home from the first day of school and our parents would ask, “Did you make any friends?” Coincidentally, it’s also one of the first questions we’re asked upon entering college. Everyone’s concern for companionship is a way of making sure he or she feels secure. The downside of this, however, is the belief that if we don’t meet a certain quota, we don’t really “have friends.” We pay more attention to the quantity of friends than the quality of those relationships. Many times we are surrounded by others, but we still feel left out. This usually leads to a less-than-happy evening of self-pity. Combatting this takes a particular way of communication and understanding with those around you. There is a way to find the light in the times when we are actually alone. There are many things that can be more therapeutic than they seem.
If you’re the type of person who can’t be alone with your thoughts, one thing I like to advise is leaving the house. Find something to do that calms you down and saves you money. This past weekend, I took a trip to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to take my mind off the present. Most art museums offer a student discount and some are even free for students, such as the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, which also has free parking. The California Science Center and the Natural History Museum are free as well and are conveniently across from campus, next to the Coliseum.
If museums aren’t your thing, another method of mental escape I indulge in is being outside in nature. Given the recent heatwave, it’s difficult to know which days are going to be good, but if you don’t care, the Rose Garden is free and right across the street from campus on Exposition Boulevard. It’s a great way to be outdoors without being trapped in unknown territory and small enough if you can only afford a 30-minute break. Another nearby park is Grand Park, in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. The park almost always has an event happening, including markets, afternoons of music or food. For instance, “Lunch à La Park” takes place every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m., with food trucks along Olive Street and the Marketplace.
If leaving the house isn’t an option or if you prefer to handle your stresses in the comfort of your home, indulge in a great movie, sleep and make sure you eat and drink water. It’s temporary relief for even the worst of days. It’s also good to sometimes throw yourself into work to take your mind off things, like the class readings you’re behind on or even cleaning your place. When I’m stuck at home, I like to write in my journal because it lets me flesh out my thoughts. There is a book called Q & A a Day: 5-Year Journal which allows you to answer a question a day for a year for five years. When you complete a year, you start over at the same date to compare. Even if you are not the type to keep up with these sorts of things, it’s a good start for finding an emotional break and it’s also only $10 on Amazon.
There are a myriad of ways to combat loneliness. One way is to spend time alone to find beauty in solitude. Just outside campus, there are museums and places to transport patrons away from their troubles. There are also other activities to relieve stress. These activities are reminders that being alone and being lonely are completely different things. College is the best time to understand that concept.

Over the weekend, Saturday Night Live and USC alumnus Will Ferrell premiered his mockumentary, “Ferrell Takes the Field.” In the comedy special, Ferrell plays for 10 different Major League Baseball teams in five different baseball games. In theory, Ferrell as a baseball player sounds like an absolutely insane concept, but anyone who is a fan of the comedian’s humor will know that he elicits the most laughs while maintaining a straight face in ridiculous situations. “Ferrell Takes the Field” caters to followers of Ferrell’s work while raising awareness for cancer.
The comedy special is raising money for Cancer for College, a foundation Ferrell’s Delta Tau Delta college fraternity brother Craig Pollard started. Pollard was a former baseball player until a cancer diagnosis stopped his career. Unfazed by his medical condition, Pollard then started his foundation to fund cancer survivors through college. The testimonials at the start of the mockumentary set the tone for the hour — comedy is a necessary agent to support young people with their dreams. By playing 10 different positions for 10 different teams, Ferrell strives to raise $1 million by the end of his baseball tour for Pollard’s foundation.
From then on, Ferrell approaches being a part of the baseball team with mock seriousness in the face of early practices and the big egos of his teammates. Ferrell also models the taciturn personalities of many famous athletes. “I’m in beast mode,” he proclaims to reporters when he begins his training with the Oakland A’s. Another highlight of the comedy special is when Ferrell interacts with the players in the Oakland clubhouse. “How much do you bench?” his teammate asked, to which Ferrell responds with sheepish mumbling.
What is clear almost directly afterward is that Ferrell is no match for the heavyweights of his team, and he is traded by famed general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt’s character in Moneyball). Ferrell responds to this move by hilariously throwing a fit reminiscent of his character in Step Brothers.
The downside of this special is that the rest of Ferrell’s experience with the MLB teams is presented in short, approximately 90-second segments. With the Dodgers, Ferrell throws a fastball, and a major player bunts the ball. As a player for the Giants, Ferrell plays catcher but does almost nothing. Though the ball is pitched to him a couple times during his stint with the Angels and the Diamondbacks, the comedian’s involvement is rather ho-hum.
At the end of the day, Ferrell makes it clear that he is not a professional baseball player. He makes a retirement speech, infusing his quintessential humor. “Was I the best player on the field today?” Ferrell asks. “Maybe.” Ferrell carries his baseball player identity hilariously throughout the speech. “There’s no doubt I turned some heads today,” Ferrell says. “I brought passion to the field, dedication, ability and a lot of ignorance. There’s life in this 47-year-old arm.”
Regardless of the short duration of the mockumentary, Ferrell on the field proves to be an enjoyable combination. Perhaps the comedy special pinpoints a very specific audience, one that enjoys both baseball and Will Ferrell, but this mockumentary successfully carries its own, following other critically acclaimed mockumentaries involving former SNL members. Documentary Now!, featuring Bill Hader and Fred Armisen, and 7 Days in Hell, featuring Andy Samberg, might be supported with an additional, excellent ensemble, but they lack that trademark Will Ferrell charm.
“Ferrell takes the Field” is now streaming on HBO Go and HBO Now.

So apparently the Sun Belt isn’t that good. Maybe if either Arkansas State or Idaho had home-field advantage, it would have been different. One of them could have held USC under 50 points, or gotten to double digits themselves. But probably not.
Now the Trojans move into the exciting part of the schedule. With all due respect to the Red Wolves and Vandals, this is the part that will actually determine USC’s role in postseason play.
Finally, a real game.
As fellow Daily Trojan columnist Regan Estes discussed Tuesday, the excitement of it goes beyond the usual anticipation for the start of in-conference competition. It’s grown to be one of the best recent rivalries in the sport, and despite Stanford’s fall from the AP Poll’s top 25, this is a legitimate challenge for the Trojans.
Though certainly less interesting, I think it was worthwhile for USC to schedule two pretty soft games. I think those two scheduling decisions will pay off greatly in USC’s quest for a College Football Playoff spot, especially considering the immediate future of the Pac-12 and when comparing it to USC’s 2016   non-conference schedule.
Stanford is the official start of a long haul for USC. Eight of USC’s 10 remaining games feature opponents that either ranked or have received votes in the AP Poll. The exceptions are Washington and Colorado, but those look more like traps than cupcakes.
The Pac-12 hasn’t looked great so far this season, but it’s still arguably the deepest conference in the NCAA, simply because no conference so far can really be called “the toughest.”
The Big Ten currently has the most momentum right now. The defending national champions received 59 first place votes, and Michigan State received the other two in the AP Poll after beating now No. 12 Oregon. But beyond that, the conference’s top 25 representation only includes No. 23 Northwestern and No. 24 Wisconsin.
The SEC had a really rough weekend, with Arkansas falling from the top 25 after a loss to Toledo and Auburn needing overtime to stave off Jacksonville State.
The other big inter-conference matchup was Oklahoma of the Big 12 taking down Tennessee of the SEC.
That leaves Ohio State at      No. 1 and Michigan State at No. 4, Alabama leading the SEC at No. 2, TCU and Baylor representing the Big 12 at No. 3 and No. 5, respectively, and USC at No. 6. The ACC still has Florida State in the top 10 at No. 9, the lowest of any top-ranked Power Five team. At this point, independent Notre Dame is still worth a mention at No. 8, but I don’t think the Irish will last.
If at the end of the year, the five conference winners have equal overall records, the odd man out will probably be the ACC winner. The only thing we can really bet on, though, is that the Big Ten winner will almost certainly not be left out of the CFP. The winner between Michigan State and Ohio State will have to have a spot over a Pac-12 team given how high-profile that                         Michigan State-Oregon matchup was. But the Pac-12 winner is still more likely to take one of those bottom spots over the ACC winner — though don’t sleep on No. 11 Clemson in the discussion.
Here’s where scheduling becomes interesting. Aside from the Notre Dame tradition, USC didn’t add any big time            non-conference games this year, but the 2016 Cowboy Classic between USC and Alabama will absolutely qualify as one. Oregon went for the latter approach the past two seasons with its Michigan State home-and-home, which obviously backfired to some degree this year.
Personally, from the standpoint of a partisan fan hoping to see his favorite team in the playoffs, I don’t think scheduling that extra non-conference challenge is worth the risk. I’d say the odds of winning those games are, for all intents and purposes, a              50-50 shot, but a crucial loss is more damaging than a trademark win is beneficial.
Oregon probably would have still made the playoff last year if its win over Michigan State was instead an FCS win. The Pac-12 conference schedule is strong enough to stand alone. Now, the Ducks have no margin for error the rest of the season, and the Spartans still have to win their conference for it to matter. If the Spartans or the 2016 Trojans end up with one more loss than the other conference winner, one extra big win won’t counter that extra loss.
Thankfully, USC made it through the first two weeks still intact. Not just in regard to its record, but also its roster, because the risk of significant injury drops in those games. Down the road, as the team — still not up to full scholarship capacity, by the way — fights its way to the finish line of conference play, we’ll be thankful USC didn’t make it any harder on itself than needed.
So in the future, I don’t hope to watch any USC games against non-Power Five conferences. They’re quite boring and leave little room for interesting commentary.
But I do hope USC schedules them anyway. Yes, the Cowboy Classic would be a fun annual tradition, but that’s what Notre Dame is for. The revenue will take care of itself, and the Trojans will hopefully be back to being good enough that winning the conference is the only necessary statement.
If we do get an annual rivalry game going with a Sun Belt team, let’s do it with Troy University. “The Trojan War” could totally earn a national primetime spot.

Women’s volleyball will ride a ten-game winning streak into Norman, Oklahoma, on Thursday to take on Oklahoma and Maryland in the Oklahoma Invitational. After racking up four three-set victories to win the USC Classic last weekend, the team will look to execute its game plan and open Pac-12 play at UCLA on Sept. 23 with a perfect record.
The Women of Troy are ranked third in the nation, behind Penn State and Texas, after starting the season at      No. 22 last month. Much of their success in the early season has been thanks to senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio. Last week, the Guadalajara, Mexico, native became the first player in over a decade, and the second overall, to win three consecutive Pac-12 Player of the Week awards in the same season.
“Samantha always brings this silent intensity to our team,” junior middle blocker Elise Ruddins said. “She’s not super loud, but when she gets a kill it is … deadly.”
Head coach Mick Haley also appreciated Bricio’s spectacular form, and he praised her versatility and ability to score points both serving and blocking. At the same time, however, Haley stressed that other members of the squad will have to rise to the occasion when needed.
“There will come a time when Samantha will not be able to do that on a certain night,” he said. “Everybody else is going to have to step up.”
Bricio’s form has helped get USC off to a hot start, but Haley emphasized the need to keep improving as the season goes on.
“We’re trying to add pieces to our system and get players ready to come in, relieve other people and play multiple positions,” he said. “It’s constantly a work in progress, but the fact that we’ve been able to do this and be successful so far … has certainly been a boost to the confidence of the players.”
Ruddins agreed with her coach and was adamant that the team would not get caught up in its own success.
“Something that we always take pride in is just going on to the next game,” she said. “We always look for what we can improve on and focus one game at a time.”
The Women of Troy open the Oklahoma Invitational with a game against the hosts. The Sooners stuttered out of the gates, beginning the season 0-3, but have since turned things around. They are 5-1 in their last six and ride a three-game winning streak into their clash with USC.
USC will then face Maryland on Friday. The Terrapins have also enjoyed a good start to their season, as they enter the tournament with a 10-1 record. Their lone loss came against George Washington last weekend.
The Oklahoma Invitational is the final fixture on USC’s schedule before the start of Pac-12 play. Haley wants to make sure that his team seizes this final opportunity to kick into midseason form.
“We’re travelling, we’re playing back-to-back [days] against … real quality opponents,” he said. “So we’re just trying to go through how it will be following week when we open with UCLA and Stanford on the road.”
The Women of Troy will open the tournament in Norman on Thursday at 6 p.m. against Oklahoma before taking on Maryland on Friday at 2:30 p.m.

Twenty minutes after his first practice, Jake Olson walked down Trousdale Parkway with his guide dog, Quebec, wearing his school clothes and a large grin across his face.
“Dreams do come true. That’s an understatement,” Olson said.
Jake Olson, the blind long snapper from Orange Lutheran High, participated in his first practice as a member of the USC football team, fulfilling a dream of his since the age of 12. Wearing a No. 17 yellow no-contact jersey, Olson worked on snaps and hung out with his fellow specialists while USC began preparations for Saturday’s game against Stanford.
“Our guys have enjoyed having Jake around because I think it puts things in perspective for them,” head coach Steve Sarkisian said after Tuesday’s practice. “Obviously, somebody has to lead him, whether it is up the tunnel, or to the practice or locker room. And everyone is just kind of taking their turns. Which, I think speaks volumes to the character of the kids that we have on our roster.”
Tuesday was a special day for the USC football team, but not just because it had dominated in its first two wins of the season and rose to number six in the AP Poll. While the majority of the team practiced on one side of the field, all the attention from the sideline was focused on a small group of special team members that included Olson, who received a scholarship to attend USC from Swim With Mike’s Physically Challenged Athletes Scholarship Fund. Because the scholarship is regarded as athletic aid, USC sought and received a waiver from the NCAA so that he did not count against the Trojans’ NCAA-mandated 85 scholarship roster limit.
“He is actually really good,” said sophomore punter Reid Budrovich. “If you line his hips up straight. He is perfect with the snaps. Today, it was getting a hang of trying to figure out where his feet need to be to snap it straight. Then once we got the hang of that he was great.”
During the practice, starting long snapper junior Zach Smith, redshirt senior punter Kris Albarado, Budrovich and other special teams players helped guide Olson routinely snap the ball to routinely convert PATs.
“I mean, he is stoked,” said Conner Sullivan, a friend of Olson and a fellow Orange Lutheran alum. “He’s been waiting for this his whole life. He’s been around this team since Pete Carroll welcomed him here. Sark’s done the same thing. It’s good to see him out here, finally, in pads.”
Olson was a long snapper his junior and senior in high school, guided onto the field and positioned over the ball by a teammate. Olson eventually earned the opportunity to fill the starting role for his high school team and received a scholarship to attend USC.
“Jake and I were good friends in high school. I knew that he wanted to be a Trojan since he was a freshman. And because it was always a dream of mine to play college football, you know it’s a tough road, but you also know that anything is possible. So when he said he wanted to do it, I believed him.”
Olson was born with retinoblastoma, a cancer of the retina. He lost his left eye when he was 10 months old and, despite numerous procedures on his other eye, he had his right eye removed in 2009 when he was 12. Olson, a lifelong Trojan fan, was introduced to the team when Pete Carroll was the coach. Carroll welcomed Olson as a frequent visitor to USC practices and games. Olson told Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times that this allowed him to find comfort in an otherwise extremely difficult time.
“There were nights of crying and stressful times when I couldn’t get the thought of going blind out of my psyche,” Olson said. “But every time I was up at ’SC or talking to one of the players or just being around, it was just pure fun. And, truthfully, pure peace.”
While playing football at USC has certainly had an immeasurable impact on Olson’s life, the freshman’s story seems to have had a similar impact on those of his new teammates.
“I think it is really awesome. It is inspirational for everybody.” Budrovich said. “Because just to see him out here just brings kind of a happy spirit. Everyone is in a better mood when they see him. Everyone loves him, so I just think it is the best experience for him.”
Olson is a motivational speaker and has co-authored two books about overcoming adversity.  His story has been chronicled nationally, being featured in several ESPN stories.
“He is an awesome kid, and I am excited to have him on the team,” redshirt senior quarterback Cody Kessler said. “Motivation-wise, when guys see that when they are out there in practice, tired, maybe not wanting to work hard today. They see him out here playing great. And it motivates you and shows the impact that a single person can have on a team — it’s really cool.”
Olson lives with seven roommates. Though he says that his roommates help him out from time to time, Olson generally gets around with the help of Quebec. He gets to practice by himself.
“Jake is just part of the team like the other freshman. And he doesn’t want to be treated any differently, and that is what I appreciate about him,” Sarkisian said. “Tomorrow is practice number two. And that is just how Jake would want it.”
Like any other freshman, Olson had to get to class after practice. “It was great,” he said. “It was awesome. It was really fun.”
Fight on my friend. You are the soul of this football team.

As college students, we’re always looking to stretch a dollar as far as we can. When it comes to grocery shopping, it can be difficult to find affordable ingredients that can be used in multiple ways. Tortillas are one of my favorite go-­tos when it comes to making a quick, cheap and easy meal.
Gone are the days when tortillas are mostly used for our favorite burritos and enchiladas. Why not give a try incorporating tortillas into your breakfast, lunch or dinner easily and affordably for a new take on a traditional dish?
For my first meal of the day, I like to make either sweet or savory “breakfast quesadillas.”

Tortillas are a staple in Mexican dishes such as enchiladas, and we’ve all made a quesadilla before. To try something new for lunch or dinner, wrap up your favorite snack or sandwich ingredients in one instead.

And, last but certainly not least, dessert –– something we can’t leave out. This is a simple and fun way to turn a boring tortilla into something crunchy and sweet! For this dessert you’ll need:

2. Coat both sides of your tortilla in the melted butter and cut into even triangles like you would a pizza.

3. Toss each slice individually in the cinnamon sugar combination and lay flat on a baking sheet lined with foil.

4. Place into a 350-degree oven and bake for 10-12 minutes. I left my tortilla chips sitting out overnight and believe they tasted even better and flakier! 
5. Serve with a fruit salsa, a sweet dip or even a simple dollop of yogurt.
Well, there you have it. Next time you pick up a pack of tortillas at the grocery store, try these dishes instead of your typical burrito.

Everyone has that one friend who constantly brags about his or her super tremendous internship on social media. After all, as the millennial slogan goes, if it’s not on social media, it didn’t even happen.
And while self-promotion can be awesome — if you’ve got it, flaunt it — after a while, your Facebook friends can become highly irritated by the shameless promotion of your greatness to all 1,372 of your friends.
People talk about FOMO — fear of missing out — mostly in regard to parties and friendships, but FOMO certainly has a place in the stress of college internships. To that person: When you’re constantly posting about your fantastic internship, your Facebook friends may be sitting at home feeling inadequate and awaiting a future of impending doom.
Huffington Post blogger Alissa Dean argues that Americans are hardwired to compete. Therefore, self-promoting posts can “trigger self reflection and social comparison, whether it’s conscious or subconscious.”
But it makes sense. You’re excited you finally got that sweet dream internship. You’ve probably worked hard in school, held lots of previous jobs and broke out all your best interview moves — or just knew a guy. It is quite exciting. Go tell your friends, inform your family and update that nifty LinkedIn account. After all, you deserve it.
But, studies show that self-promotion can backfire.
George Loewenstein, professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University, wrote a paper “You Call It ‘Self-Exuberance,’ I Call It ‘Bragging,’” in which he looked at the potentially negative reactions sparked by people sharing their achievements on social media.
“Our research supports that being the recipient of self-promotion may induce bad feelings. Undoubtedly some of these feelings may be due to the fact that others’ self-promotion makes people feel annoyed, so they may end up being resentful,” Loewenstein wrote.
So, for the people who are always posting their accomplishments — whether it’s snagging that great internship, meeting someone famous through work or getting into four law schools — just know that a lot of your friends might not only feel irritated, but also start resenting you.
Nevertheless, a worthwhile concept to keep in mind is that social media in internships is just like everything else: People only share the things they think other people will be impressed by. The exciting posts on Facebook probably do not represent day-to-day intern responsibilities. No one posts pictures of cleaning the kitchen, restocking the fridge or running a package to FedEx.
Instead, we choose to post the images we think are impressive. We have our real identities and our online identities, providing an unbalanced picture of our daily lives. MIT professor Sherry Turkle told the Boston Globe that managing our online selves has become extremely complex, in part because of the difference between our virtual selves and our real selves.
“During the day, you look at your noncurated self. You live with your mistakes. On Facebook, you’re always the way you want to be,” Turkle said.
I discovered that I was part of the problem. At my previous internship, I sat around waiting for someone to give me something to do. I was bored. But then I noticed a cool film poster next to me and opened my Snapchat to take a picture. I shared it with my friends with the caption #internlife, making my job seem exciting.
Though I have loved every one of the internships I’ve had, those Snapchats and Facebook posts were not fully representative of my experiences. My experiences were great, but for the reason any internship is great: I learned a lot and made valuable relationships.
I met Steve Carell when I worked for his production company, and while I didn’t get a picture with him because that would have been unprofessional, if I had posted a picture of me and him, my Facebook friends probably would have been impressed and maybe a little jealous of my awesome internship. But they would have been jealous for all the wrong reasons.
Though meeting Steve Carell was everything I had hoped and dreamed it would be, it was not representative of my day-to-day life. But that’s all people would have known — if I had even done it in the first place.
Self-promoters out there, know that your friends are annoyed and envious. And for those recipients of self-promotion, know that all your friends — including myself — can be dirty little social media liars.

When the University of California, San Diego filed a lawsuit against USC forbidding the former director of their Alzheimer’s study, Dr. Paul Aisen, from taking his research program when he relocated to USC, it asserted its right as a research institution. It insinuated that Dr. Aisen should surrender the ownership of his research to the institution in which the research is conducted. But when students enter the world of academia, they are instructed on the ethics of research and intellectual property. Stealing an idea, project or experimental result from another student is no different from stealing a book or a phone. If students are forced to practice these principles, then colleges such as UCSD should apply the same code of ethics by loosening their grip on researchers’ projects and allowing freedom of ownership in academia.
When UCSD lost 8 of its 10 sponsors — which were worth approximately $93.5 million — to USC, it was unlikely that they could continue to support their Alzheimer’s program, a clinical study with critical implications for our nation’s health. In the next 50 years, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease will be a colossal burden on humanity as we are faced with an aging population. In 2007, a group at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health published a study projecting that the incidence of Alzheimer’s will quadruple to 1 in 85 persons worldwide by 2050. The same study also stated that an intervention to delay the onset by just one year would create nearly 9.2 million fewer cases of the disease in 2050. Because of UCSD’s financial setbacks, Aisen chose to relocate his project to USC, where the vital study could prosper under a better-funded institution.
UCSD’s hostile reaction to Aisen’s move was uncalled for, particularly since failing to relocate the program would have put the project in jeopardy. Rather than respect the director’s decision, the university lashed out against Aisen. One professor at UCSD even threatened to “have Dr. Aisen arrested, put in jail and his medical license suspended,” according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. But such a response is indicative of a greater menacing environment in which science cannot thrive. Moreover, this animosity sets a poor example toward students. An institution cannot preach academic integrity while failing to put its words to practice.
UCSD’s repossession of Aisen’s project represents a distorted ethical practice. UCSD claimed that Aisen “illegally seized control of data and computer systems that belong to UC San Diego,” according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. In fact, the project Aisen brought to Los Angeles was his own — it was UCSD that first stole the project from him. A university should not enforce a code of ethics forbidding plagiarism and stealing of intellectual property if it does not practice these laws itself. Students across the country face strict penalties for violating this code, and rightly so.
In a study as important as this, such a move will have unprecedented consequences. In an email to the Los Angeles Times, Aisen reacted to UCSD’s case saying, “We all lose here. Science and public health lose when research is torn from the investigators with the passion, knowledge and skill to assure its success.”
College students are taught the importance of attributing words or an idea to their creator. By claiming that it owned the entire Alzheimer’s study, UCSD disregarded Aisen’s role as a leader of the project and failed to uphold this golden rule in academia. When UCSD won its court case against Aisen and USC, taking possession of much of Aisen’s project, it drove a wedge between science and the scientist.
The claims made by this article are so wrong it is almost comedic. First of all you need to know how IP contracts work between an employer and employee. Do you think that if you lead a research team at Microsoft, you are allowed to take “your” work to Google just because you decided that it was time to switch employers? Another question: what if “your” research was actually built on investments and research at the expense of your old institution. Obviously you can’t just brush off the fact that the old institution has a large, if not complete, ownership of the research you’ve performed. As an employee of UCSD, Aisen was hired to manage a study that UCSD already had under its possession. Knowing just this fact itself already breaks the foundation of all your arguments in this article. You make the naive assumption that the ownership was Aisen’s and his alone, and this is conveniently repeated throughout your article when in fact it is pretty inaccurate. Don’t just blindly take the side of your alma mater and actually DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, a problem USC seems to be having. Otherwise you can just follow in your alma mater’s footsteps and pay for research already conducted.
There is one aspect that you are ignoring.  Eight out of the ten sponsors stated that they have more confidence in USC than UCSD to continue the Alzheimer’s study.  As a university, USC is able to obtain good private funding while UCSD depends mostly on to government funding.
First of all this is a non-sequitur and doesn’t address what I’ve talked about already. We were talking about IP ownership and you’re bringing something up something entirely different. Just because Google is better than Microsoft at internet search, does that give them the right to all of Microsoft’s research into search? No. Obviously not. 
Second, do you research. These sponsors had more confidence AFTER USC took the whole research group from UCSD (How USC managed to bully and threatened UCSD faculty into joining USC is another story entirely). OBVIOUSLY the sponsors would say that USC has the capacity to continue the research … because USC took all the resources needed to maintain the research from UCSD (which is why UCSD sued USC btw). Would they have sided with USC before the group left for USC? Probably not. Thank you for pointing this out Varadarajan because USC likes to flout this piece of information which is both very misleading and allows for an easy mental shortcut for people not aware of what is going on.
Professor Paul Aisen brought in the research money to UCSD, and he chose to leave the institution.  The data collected and the intellectual property belongs to UCSD with Dr. Aisen as a prime inventor.  I am aware of all these factors, and yet the sponsors of present and prospective fundign have more confidence in USC than on UCSD.  I have also gone to school at the University of California system.  These universities are perceived as heavily funded state universities; and it is often teh case, that they are used to delivering results at high costs.
There is a fundamental issue in biological sciences that does not follow the Google or Microsoft model and that is intellectual right to knowledge generated by a PI. In the case of one being hired by a major software company to “solve a problem”using a specific set of tools, resources, and personnel as well as pre-signed documents (MTAs and rights to discovery for example) results in protecting a company to retain all generated data, findings, and property. Thus they are in a position to block an employee from leaving to work on a similar project and in the case of some higher executives can block employment all together. In biology especially in the academic realm the PI generally holds all the intellectual rights. They may be in a position to negotiate a sharing of any financial income that may come from licensing for example. What is also often the case is the the general idea of a research program comes from a PI or set of PI’s submitting a grant, usually to a federal agency, and obtaining the support to carryout the proposed studies. In most cases the hosting institution is very interested in the overhead which can range from 60 to 70%, which means for every $100,000 obtained to support the research the institution gets   $70,000. The federal agency sends a total of $170,000. When a PI leaves a institution for another they take their grants with them with permission of the funding agency, which is not always difficult to secure. A major problem is UCSD now has lost the indirects, lost funds that support core facilities, and these are gained by the new hosting institution.  Co-investigators can simply express their support of such a shift but it is really the funding agency and its support that is needed. Dr. Aisen has full intellectual rights to his data and should be able to take it with him. This is standard in biological and academic sciences for the last 100 years. UCSD has made a claim that it is an issue of protecting the data and the research when in fact it is most likely the need to retain the indirect costs, which are substantial of course. We do not know exactly unless we can look into the financial souls of the UCSD regents but it appears so. The fact that investigators switch institutions is not new. In a time when there was lots of federal funding no one really cared. Now in an era of tight budgets, very limited support from federal support, and the high cost of big science and expensive facilities in academic institutions, it has become an issue. Of course now as we move forward it is anticipated that academic investigators and  their host institutions will be “lawyering up”  at some cost both financially and intellectually. Gone are the good old days when scientists did amazing discoveries on shoe-string budgets. Rutherford’s model of the electron was based on an experiment that cost about 100 pounds in 1910 (maybe a few thousand now). A 100 pounds (or Euros) will only buy dinner for 3 (without wine) at the CERN supercollider dining hall in Switzerland; but that story is for another day.

Is your gameday style “Trojan Fanatic” or a “Total Sorority Move?” Caroline Feda | Daily Trojan
Everyone has their go-to outfit on gameday — the one you daydream about wearing all week while waiting for Saturday to come. Where you can be found and what you are doing during a USC home football game can be easily discerned from your game day attire. Are you running around 28th Street in a cardinal and gold afro? Or are you keeping it classic on McCarthy with your USC Dad Polo?  Here’s a guide to gameday style personas and what it says about you.
The Trojan Fanatic
You have officially been diagnosed with Trojan fever and that means on gameday you go all out. Whether it is in Trojan warrior gear, cardinal and gold body paint or a morph suit, you are often stopped for pictures on McCarthy Quad. Bookstore clothing is  too basic for you, and much of your outfit has been custom made or ordered online. The Trojan fanatic is anyone from an overeager freshman to a nostalgic alum. You can find the fanatics at the 50-yard line, clamoring against the stadium railings and fighting to be featured on the jumbotron.
The Total Sorority Move
A crop top with your letters, song girl skirt and high socks are your gameday staples. Let’s not forget your house’s football fanny pack to hold all the essentials. For you, a typical gameday starts off getting ready and taking pictures with your sisters before tailgate hopping from one fraternity to another. On gamedays, 28th Street is your playground. And for those that decide to ditch the game, at least you dressed the part.
The Frat Star
Unlike southern universities, you keep it pretty laid back when it comes to gameday wear. The frat star often chooses a classic USC Hawaiian button-down or a fraternity’s gameday shirt. The top is paired with khaki shorts, converse and an oversized woven, straw hat. Don’t let the chill vibes fool you though, these boys take football and tailgating seriously. Even when the game is at 5 p.m., you can find the frat star blasting the USC fight song from their speakers for all of  the Row to hear at 10 a.m.
The Alumni
You are among the most proud gameday-goers on campus. Alumni can usually be found wearing anything that represents their alma mater in full view. Older alumni are easier to spot in “USC Dad” or “USC Grandma” shirts, feasting on the university-catered tailgate. Others get creative and use gameday as an excuse to reconnect with old classmates for bachelorette parties or birthdays on McCarthy Quad. However, the more recent graduates are quick to disguise themselves in old sorority gear or fraternity gear and can be found hanging with their littles at their old houses.
The Average Tommy
Essentially the average Joe of gameday, you keep it simple with a pair of blue jeans and a USC t-shirt. If you’re really feeling crazy, a few temporary tattoos and a bit of glitter may get thrown into the mix. You can be found anywhere from a McCarthy Quad tailgate to an off-campus barbeque. For you gameday is about good friends, good food and watching your favorite team play some football.
The “It’s a Gameday?” Student
You are in jeans, a hoodie and, of course, sound-proof headphones on your way to Leavey Library. Saturday isn’t for football, it’s for homework! You could care less about the score on board. It’s all about the score on your “Organic Chemistry” midterm. While the majority of campus can’t understand your decision, you trudge on confidently with your backpack to a library cubicle and tap your pencil in time with the USC fight song.
