Two former executives of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and the chief executive of a rave promotion company were arrested Thursday. Though the charges were not immediately disclosed, attorneys said they believed the criminal counts are for conspiracy regarding the stadium’s operation, according to the Associated Press.

Authorities arrested Patrick Lynch, former Coliseum general manager; Todd DeStefano, former Coliseum events manager; and Reza Gerami, chief executive of Go Ventures, Thursday morning.
The Chief of Staff for City Councilman Bernard C. Parks said the councilman, a member of the Coliseum commission, was not surprised by the arrests.
“It’s unfortunate,” Chief of Staff Bernard C. Parks Jr. said. “But it’s pretty predictable, having followed this now for a year and knowing the different law enforcement agencies that were involved. He knew this day was coming.”
The venue’s financial activity has been the subject of scandal for more than a year. In November, the Coliseum Commission sued Lynch and DeStefano, alleging that they had mishandled funds and siphoned money for personal gain. The suit also named rave promoters Go Ventures and Insomniac Events.
Parks Jr. said there is no connection between the charges filed and USC’s negotiations with the Coliseum Commission for a master lease.
“I know there have been some people trying to draw a parallel line between these two events, but it’s really apples and oranges,” Parks Jr. said. “I don’t think you can hand over a public facility for free based on the negligence of a couple employees at the Coliseum. One thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other.”
In addition to Thursday’s arrests, a lawyer for Insomniac Events, which has worked with the Coliseum, said the company expects its chief executive to be arrested as well, but is confident that the charges levied against him are invalid, according to the Los Angeles Times.
Los Angeles City Controller Wendy Greuel, whose office is currently investigating and auditing the operation’s finances, said the arrests signify the need for reform.
“We must demand zero tolerance when it comes to allegations of public corruption, wasteful spending, fraudulent activity and abuse of city resources,” Greuel said in a statement. “[Thursday’s] arrests are indicative of the need for bold changes at the Coliseum.”
Does this mean they will start selling beer at the Coliseum during SC games again?
Go Ventures has not been having a good year… Insomniac ftw.

Bernard and Shirley Kinsey, collectors of African art and historical documents, spoke about their collection and life experiences in an event sponsored by the USC Black Alumni Association, along with USC Spectrum on Thursday at Bovard Auditorium.
Historical significance · Philanthropist Shirley Kinsey said she hopes her collection inspires others to learn about their heritage. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
The event, An Evening of Art and Legacy, helped raise funds to contribute to scholarships for USC’s black students.
Bernard and Shirley Kinsey are a Los Angeles couple who have used their financial resources to contribute to philanthropy, art, history and education.
President C. L. Max Nikias spoke about the couple’s collection of African art in an opening statement for the event and said the exhibit helps individuals understand the history of African Americans.
“As a powerful cultural assembly, the Kinsey Collection tells us stories through things, but it also tells us things through stories,” Nikias said. “These pieces of African-Americana [track] a history of resilience over racism [and] dignity over despair.”
The event was established by the USC Black Alumni Association as a fundraiser for student scholarships. Shirley Kinsey said the event will help USC attract and support future and current black students.
“With the finances you all provided tonight, [the Black Alumni Association] will be able to add to their scholarship fund, so that USC can continue to attract and maintain some of America’s best and brightest black students,” Kinsey said. “The students who are recruited here will contribute to making USC a better place to call home.”
The couple’s collection began because of their extensive world travels and their interest in the cultures of the locations they visited, Shirley Kinsey said.
“We realized when we were traveling that we were always interested in indigenous cultures, and we always wanted to bring something back from those cultures,” she said. “We soon realized that we didn’t know enough about our own culture, and that’s when the collection started.”
Bernard Kinsey said the purpose of his collection is to give back to others by inspiring others to learn about their heritage.
“You can’t accept a blessing with a closed fist, and you’ve got to take the glove off and throw the ball back sometimes,” Kinsey said. “There are people that need [help] more and who can do more with it if you give it to them.”
Alicia Jewell, a freshman majoring in business administration, said the event demonstrated how people can make a difference through the collecting and embracing  of art.
“It’s interesting to see how a couple can influence others to care more about their heritage through their own collection of art,” Jewell said. “It’s also inspiring to see people who care so deeply about the students at USC who need financial assistance by using their abilities to raise funds for [the students].”

USC announced plans to partner with the Chilean Ministry of Education to give Chilean doctoral students full tuition and living stipends, beginning in 2013.
The university will pay for the tuition and living stipends and the Chilean Ministry of Education will provide support needed for travel.
Of the approximately 4,800 international graduate students at USC, seven are from Chile and 24.7 percent of graduate students are international, said Anthony Bailey, associate provost for global initiatives.
“It’s an important component in our efforts to continue to broaden the geographic and cultural diversity of our graduate student body and the global nature of our research portfolio,” Bailey said.
Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are the only other universities that have the same agreement with Chile’s Ministry of Education.
The fellowships, through the Chilean National Commission for Scientific and Technological Research, follow a 2008 Memorandum of Understanding between Chile and the state of California to encourage collaboration.
The Chilean National Commision of Scientific Investigation and Technology said the Chile-USC fellowships represent a joint effort to cultivate outstanding Chilean students and scholars to pursue a Ph.D. at USC.
“We are excited to partner with the University of Southern California, one of the world’s top universities, to support students from Chile as they continue to pursue their ideas and research,” said CONICYT Program Director Denise Saint-Jean.
Bailey said that while USC works to strengthen historic ties in the Pacific Rim, the university   is also strategically deepening its engagement in Latin America.
“Chile has the most developed economy in the region and, in 2010, was the first Latin American country to join the [Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development],” Bailey said.
The OECD, established in 1960, works to improve social and economic conditions around the world through collaboration between its 34 member countries.
Bailey also said Chile has many geographic and economic similarities to California in terms of natural resource management, global trade and disaster mitigation.
“The University of Southern California benefits from the rich diversity of its students, scholars and faculty who come from around the world to become members of the Trojan Family,” Bailey said. “This fellowship program will help support outstanding doctorate students from Chile as we work together to meet the world’s most pressing challenges.”
In 2011, USC and the Ministry of Taiwan signed a similar agreement, which will go into effect in the next academic year.

The Ostrow School of Dentistry is launching a fundraising campaign to raise $115 million over the next seven years.
The initiative launch is in conjunction with the school’s 115th anniversary and is one of the largest fundraising endeavors of a dental institution in the U.S. The fundraiser is also part of the comprehensive Campaign for USC, a fundraising drive seeking to raise $6 billion for the university.
Building campaign · Some of the $115 million the school plans to raise will be used to improve facilities used by the dental school. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
The school plans to use the money to fund scholarships, recruit and retain faculty, build facilities and care for patients.
Calen Ouellette, director of development and alumni relations for Ostrow, said the fundraising initiative will focus on articulating these goals to the public.
“There’s a strong communication component to [the campaign] where we’re making sure our alumni and friends know what’s happening within the school and know what our objectives are,” Oullette said.
The funds will mainly be used to provide student scholarships, Ouellette said.
“We want to make sure we’re able to recruit students, to keep students and to reward or recognize students with our scholarships if they’ve done a great job,” Ouellette said. “We want them to go out into the profession, make an impact, and one of the last concerns they should have is how they are going to pay back the school.”
In addition, the money raised from the campaign will seek to increase the number of faculty members and improve facilities, said Beth Dunham, an editor in the Ostrow Office of Public Relations.
“Endowed faculty support [means] recruiting and retaining faculty as well as bringing in new experts,” Dunham said. “Better use of clinical space, better learning spaces for our students, better research bases and more — it’s all really important for supporting student education as well as our research initiatives.”
The fundraising campaign will seek to develop patient care in order for graduates to be strongly prepared for their future careers, Ouellette said. In the past 10 years, students and faculty have treated more than 650,000 patients.
“For us to be able to give access to care to those patients is an important aspect of our mission as a school,” Ouellette said. “The students need to work with the patients as well because the more diverse patients they work with [and] the more different cases they have, the better equipped they are to be better practitioners when they go out.”
Dunham said all efforts of the campaign ultimately showcase the school’s dedication in providing the best education for its students. She said maintaining a high standard in technology and research and attracting quality faculty ultimately helps students learn.
“It’s access to that faculty that can really make a student’s education special,” Dunham said. “It all comes together in terms of our fundraising goals — scholarships, faculty and facilities — because they all come back to students and making sure that their education is the best possible they can get.”
As well as reflecting on the school’s prominence in the dental field, the initiative will also ensure the continued readiness of its students to lead the industry, Ouellette said.
“Moving forward, dentistry has the opportunity to lead the effort in preventative medicine and adjust to the demands of society,” Ouellette said. “I hope the next century of our reign [as a] dental school is making sure that we’re producing the best students and that they’re making the biggest impact in the industry.”
[…] “We want to make sure we’re able to recruit students, to keep students, and to reward or recognize students with our scholarships if they’ve done a great job. We want them to go into the profession, make an impact, and one of the last concerns they should have is how they are going to pay back the school.” [1] […]

For the fourth time in four spring practices, USC’s defense exerted its superiority over the offense. The Matt Barkley-led unit consistently had trouble gaining yards against its defensive counterpart, with many passes falling to the turf and few, if any, big runs out of the backfield.
Speed bump · The Trojans’ banged-up Matt Barkley-led unit has been trying to close the gap between defense and offense. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“The gap’s closing,” USC coach Lane Kiffin said. “But I think the defense is still a little bit ahead. It doesn’t help not having Robert [Woods], George [Farmer] and Khaled [Holmes] out there.”
Granted, the Trojans’ offense is not at full strength. In addition to those three starters, redshirt freshman running back Buck Allen did not practice, as well as redshirt tight ends Xavier Grimble (junior) and Junior Pomee (sophomore).
Moreover, this is only spring practice, a time where defenses across the country hold the advantage over their offensive opponents because of the reactionary nature of that side of the ball. During March and April, offenses are still getting their timing and schemes down, while the defense can rely more on athleticism and instinct.
Still, there is something to be said about the defense thus far. This is still a USC offense that, although a bit banged up, features eight returning starters, excluding those not practicing because of injuries and including All-Americans Barkley and sophomore wide receiver Marqise Lee.
And it’s not as if the defense has not had its share of injuries either: sophomore linebacker Dion Bailey sat out with a hamstring injury, while sophomore safety Josh Shaw, a transfer from Florida, missed practice again because of a rib injury.
The amount of hype placed on the offense since the end of last season has bordered on excessive, yet still seems deserved. But the Trojans’ defense is happily winning the spring battle while slipping under the radar.
“The offense gets the hype, but we take pride in our defense,” senior defensive end Devon Kennard said. “We have to keep improving, but we’re looking good so far.”
The defense has shifted one of its players over to the offense to give it an extra boost. Day two of the Tre Madden running back experiment was a success, with the sophomore able to use his size and strength to burst through holes.
“He’s an exciting prospect to have there,” Kiffin said. “He has natural instincts and really good ball skills. It’s going to be about learning our system and ball security since he hasn’t been used to carrying the ball in a while.”
Madden said running with the ball is not foreign to him.
“I played quarterback in high school, so it’s not a shock to have the ball in my hands,” Madden said.
Perhaps Madden’s switch will spark the offense. If not, then the defense will enjoy its success while it can, because the amount of offensive talent on the field and on the sideline suggests that it won’t be contained for long.
Hi I really liked the report, but you sited that Grimble was a junior and Pomee was a sophmore. Grimble is a red shirt sophmore and Pomee is a red shirt freshmen.

The Women of Troy showed off their defensive prowess on Thursday, allowing no more than one goal per period in a 7-3 home win over Long Beach State.
Water logged · Sophomore two-meter Colleen O’Donnell and the Women of Troy held their own against the 49ers with a 7-3 win. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
No. 3 USC (13-3) spread out its scoring, as seven different players netted a point for the Women of Troy.
The 49ers (7-11) kept close through most of the first half, only down by a 3-2 deficit well into the second period.
But the Women of Troy scored back-to-back goals to end the half to give themselves a 5-2 advantage heading into the locker room.
Both sophomore goalies had strong performances in the goal, as Flora Bolonyai had 10 saves for USC and Kelly Ringel recorded 14 for Long Beach State.
Unfortunately for the 49ers, Ringel made 12 of her saves in the second half, after the Women of Troy already had a comfortable lead.
Long Beach State’s Heather Mckeon opened the scoring in the second half with a goal to cut the USC lead to 5-3, but the Women of Troy didn’t allow a goal for the rest of the game.
Senior driver Nadia Dan scored the 100th goal of her career to give USC a 6-3 lead in the third period, then junior two-meter Patricia Jancso netted the only goal of the fourth period to make the final score 7-3.
Sophomore two-meter Colleen O’Donnell, freshman driver Monica Vavic and junior drivers Dominique Sardo, Chelsea Silvers and Blair Moody all scored for USC in the first half.
The Women of Troy now fly out to Tempe for Mountain Pacific Sports Federation conference games at No. 4 Arizona State on Saturday at noon before heading back home for a nonconference match against No. 7 Loyola Marymount at 1 p.m. at McDonald’s Swim Stadium.

USC had hoped for some momentum heading into one of its toughest series of the season, but having lost three out of four, the Trojans will have to find another way to combat No. 2 Stanford.
The cardinal and gold travel to take on the Cardinal in Palo Alto, Calif., Friday for the beginning of a three game series that, like the set with North Carolina, will provide an accurate assessment of where USC stands as it reaches the meat of its schedule.
Stanford has yet to play a conference game, but is 13-2 and ranked only behind No. 1 Florida in Baseball America’s top-25 rankings released on Monday.
USC fell just outside the top-25 (29th) in the latest rankings but have enjoyed what many would call a successful season thus far. Still, the Trojans won their first seven games of the season and are 6-6 since, including dropping two out of three in their first conference series of the season against Utah.
Many of the bright spots for the Trojans reside in the batting lineup, where the majority of the regulars have their average above .300. First baseman Matt Foat might be enjoying the best season of them all, batting .400 with two home runs and 13 RBIs to go along with a team-leading 28 hits in 19 games.
That offense will be put to the test beginning Friday. Stanford’s weekend trio of starters, right-hander Mark Appel and lefties John Hochstatter and Brett Mooneyham, have gone at least six innings in 11 of their 12 combined starts on the year. Mooneyham, likely to start the final game of the series on Sunday, is 4-0 with a 2.33 ERA.
In addition to proving they can compete with a team like Stanford, USC will have to convince rankings voters that it can win on the road. The Trojans have lost only two games within the friendly confines of Dedeaux Field. Do the math, and you’ll get USC’s winning percentage away from Dedeaux: .333.
All three games against Stanford are afternoon starts, with Saturday and Sunday’s games beginning at 1 p.m. and Monday’s starting at 4 p.m.

Experts discussed how the perception of Muslim Americans has become politicized since September 11, 2001, on Thursday at Muslims in America: Identity, Politics and Engagement, a panel sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.

Both Muslim and non-Muslim students and faculty attended the panel, which focused on the high-stakes politics of an election year and the social climate surrounding the 10-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.
Panelist Sherman Jackson, a professor of religion and American studies and ethnicity King Faisal Chair in Islamic Thought and Culture, said turning the Islamic culture into a political issue is part of the problem.
“This is a culture in which we have politicized everything,” Jackson said.
He said politicians use lingering fear of terrorism and ignorance of the Muslim culture to polarize voters on certain issues.
Moderator Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute, said this tactic is the opposite of what politicians should do.
“For years and years, the primary way the candidates have gotten elected was through the efforts of persuasion of voters on the other side of the aisle,” Schnur said. “Instead, now those candidates on both sides of the aisle turn to people who already agree with them and hype them up into a frenzy.”
Several panelists and audience members said the way they see politicians mobilize their supporters into these frenzied states is through ramping up sentiment for polarizing issues. Panelist Christian Patterson, vice president of the Political Science Undergraduate Association, said the controversy around the plan to build a mosque near the site of the attacks on the World Trade Center is one example of this tactic.
“Whether you agree or disagree with the so-called ‘9/11 mosque,’ the way politicians dealt with it was to use it to motivate people to sprout up with anti-Muslim sentiment and to make it an issue,” Patterson said.
This use of fear for political gain is especially a problem for Muslim Americans, panelists said.
“The problem is that Islam becomes an explanation for everything … no matter what Muslims do, their actions will be attributed back to the Quran,” Jackson said. “Islam and Islam alone comes to be identified as the animator of all Muslim action.”
Though this use of religion as a political scapegoat has been a persistent issue for several years, panelists were hopeful this trend could be reversed.
“We need to have conversations about what are the unique contributions of Muslim Americans, how are we different and what are we bringing to the table,” said panelist Najeeba Syeed-Miller, assistant professor of interreligious education at the Claremont School of Theology.
The event was planned in part to broaden the conversation about the Muslim community in America.
“The primary hope is that people understand that Muslims are one of the most diverse groups in America,” said Director of Muslim Student Life Ali Mir. “They are diverse; they are human beings; they are dynamic and they don’t all practice religion in the same way.”
The reactions of several students in the audience showed that the event realized these goals.
Catherine Brackett, a freshman majoring in political science, said she understood Muslim culture better after hearing the panelists’ discussion.
“I’d never thought about the fact that Islam was brought here by slaves because society always associates it with Arabs and that is not the whole truth,” Brackett said. “It enlightened me in that way.”
Though they were not learning about Muslim culture in the same way, Muslim students in the audience also said the discussion was insightful.
“To be part of a conversation so diverse as this was really great,” said James Khabushani, a junior majoring in business administration. “It brought me a different perspective on what my ethnicity means.”
UPDATE: A 2011 survey has the negative rating down to 61%. I guess we’re making some progress.
It is my hope that one day these panels on religion will also address the god-view of non-believers/unbelievers as a 2007 Pew survey shows while 46% would be less inclined to vote for a Muslim for president, 63% would be less likely to vote for an atheist.
As an atheist myself, it is curious that the lack of a supernatural worldview would somehow make a person a less acceptable candidate, particularly in light of sectarian infighting; historically and in contemporary culture.
Great panel to hold. The Muslim world is so diverse and varied: just like the Christian world. It’s such a shame that most media representations are so concentrated on only one aspect.
Yes, and there are still black slaves today in Africa owned by Muslim Arabs…whaddya know? How diverse!

After sweeping both UC Santa Barbara and UCLA on the road last week, the USC men’s volleyball team (15-4, 12-4 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play) kick off their final homestand of the season by facing George Mason (7-11, 3-4 in Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association play) tonight. This will be the seventh time the Trojans face off against the Patriots, and the Trojans have never lost to their East Coast foe.

The visiting Patriots will pose an intriguing challenge to the second-ranked Trojans in their unpredictability.
“They are a bit more unorthodox in their service and receiving formations, unlike any teams we have played so far. They hit a standing float serve, as well as have a lot of guys we are not familiar with,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said.
Luckily, the Trojans have looked unbeatable in their recent matches. They are riding a 10-game win streak, including a sweep over top-ranked UCLA in Westwood last Wednesday. Still, the Trojans are fourth in the MPSF standings and, with the top five teams all within two games of each other, need to keep up their high level of play and finish strong.
Despite the conference tournament being less than a month away, senior co-captain and outside hitter Tony Ciarelli is determined not to let the Trojans get complacent.
“We need to maintain our competitive spirit no matter how well we are performing,” Ciarelli said. “The goal is to stay focused in every practice, and keep our confidence no matter what.”
Ciarelli was named the MPSF Conference Player of the Week and has continued to perform at an All-American level. He is third in the nation in kills and sixth in aces per set. Along with his recent statistics, Ciarelli has flourished in his leadership role.
“He has made a concentrated effort to work us through tough in-game situations and has embraced the captain role,” Ferguson said.
Additionally, last week included a milestone for Ferguson, who won his 100th game as the Trojans’ coach. Even with his accomplishments, the man more commonly known as “Fergie” had only praise for others when asked about his achievement.
“It doesn’t matter how much you know as a coach,” Ferguson said. “It’s the quality of the people around you.”
As well as playing against an unfamiliar foe, the Trojans will be playing this and next week’s games in North Gym with the Galen Center in use for the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards. Located in the Physical Education Building, the gym has not hosted a volleyball game since 2006. Despite being a sharp contrast from the new, glistening court at the Galen Center, the court with a capacity of about 400 should provide a crowded and raucous atmosphere for the Trojans’ three games there.
Ferguson is excited about the opportunity to take a trip back in time through the history of the USC volleyball program.
“Most of the major history of the program was made here,” Ferguson said. “Our alumni are always talking about the glory days, so this is a cool opportunity, especially for our seniors, to experience the site where five championship squads played.”

Fresh off a Women’s National Invitational Tournament run, the USC’s women’s basketball team garnered much attention in the preseason, as they landed in the preseason Associated Press top-25 poll for the first time since 2006. USC was also picked to finish second in conference behind Stanford, according to a Pac-12 coaches poll.
But for the third-straight season in the Michael Cooper era, the team fell short of an NCAA tournament bid. The season was a disappointment. Expectations were not fulfilled.
“This is just a hard moment to talk about because our dreams and visions were much further than this, but it ends today,” Cooper said following the team’s 69-55 defeat to Washington State in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament.
And he was right. There would be no celebration on Selection Monday. There would be no March Madness experience for the Women of Troy yet again.
For a program with as much history and tradition as the USC women’s basketball program has had, there is no consolation prize. Success is expected. Winning is expected. Falling short of the playoffs time and again isn’t good enough.
And it’s really mind-boggling, to say the least.
Cooper’s two recruiting classes in 2010-11 and 2011-12 have been ranked No. 7 and No. 8, respectively. In 2010, forward Cassie Harberts was the prize of the class as the No. 11 overall recruit, and she has been a fixture in the starting lineup for the Women of Troy since stepping foot onto the USC campus. This year freshman guard Ariya Crook (No. 2 point guard in the nation according to ESPNU) and freshman forward Alexyz Vaioletama (No. 6 power forward in the nation according to ESPNU) saw significant playing time.
The team has been loaded with players not even recruited by Cooper, too. Senior guards Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath have been the backbone of the program for the last three seasons under Cooper. Both were All-Pac-10 Team selections last year. Junior forward Christina Marinacci has played a pivotal role in the team’s success during all of Cooper’s years as coach. Even senior guard Jacki Gemelos — when healthy — provided the team with playmaking, outside shooting and leadership in her first full season with the team last year.
With eight All-Americans on the roster — seven that could contribute taking into account Gemelos’ season-ending knee injury in mid-December — and each one of them playing a key role on the team, there wasn’t a sliver of doubt in my mind that this team could be really special this year, especially considering the circumstances.
UCLA, a team picked to finish fourth in the conference, had lost its coach, Nikki Caldwell, during the offseason when she chose to leave for Louisiana State University. Senior forward Jasmine Dixon ruptured her Achilles heel in mid-September and was ruled out for the entire season. Their starting point guard from last year, Doreena Campbell, had graduated. In short, they were going through a transition phase.
California, picked to finish third in the conference behind USC, had guard Alexis Gray-Lawson to the WNBA. Gray-Lawson finished second in the Pac-10 in scoring last season. The Golden Bears also dealt with the loss of forward DeNesha Stallworth, who transferred to Kentucky.
These two teams were USC’s main competitors outside of Stanford, the unanimous pick to finish first in the Pac-12 for the 11th consecutive season. The Women of Troy’s recognition was rightfully deserved, too, with the amount of talent and experience returning.
USC started conference play 5-1, with its lone loss coming against Stanford. Even in that game, USC led midway through the second half. But as fast as they started, the Women of Troy hit a bumpy patch, losing five of their next seven games. Three of those losses came against Colorado, Utah and Washington — teams that finished below .500 in conference play. USC recovered to win its last six games of the regular season, though.
But then came the dagger — the loss to No. 11 Washington State in the Pac-12 tournament.
It was shocking. It was disappointing. In the last three years, the Women of Troy have fallen short. They’ve been on the outside looking in. They haven’t had that punctuating season you’d expect from a group this talented.
Next year could be different, but again, I’ve been thinking that for some time. Losing Corral and Gilbreath hurts, but Marinacci and Harberts will be back. Along with Crook, Vaioletama and junior Stefanie Gilbreath off the bench, that’s still a solid core returning.
But can USC get to the tournament with Cooper at the helm?
Only time will tell.

I love Coach Cooper. I wish more people would give him a chance. I’m starting to come around.
One error, rather major….Alexis Gray Lawson left Cal two years ago.  She didn’t play in the WNBA her first year out of school, but did play overseas.  She was picked up by Phoenix this past season.
Also, you should have noted the coaching change at Cal.  Joanne Boyle left for Virginia and was replaced by Lindsay Gottlieb.  Cal has no seniors on this year’s squad.
Trakh’s team were hit with the injury bug his few years Butch so so ur research. Cooper is a great WNBA Coach where players don’t have to be motivated to play. He has no idea how to motivate college women to play basketball. They need to fire Cooper and hire a TRUE college coach. Then we’ll be back. There is no reason for a group this talented to not win 20+ games a year and make the NCAA Tournament
The worst thing USC ever did was NOT renew the contract of Chris Gobrecht. She was turning this program around, she inherited a hot arse mess. It took a few years with all the injuries they had, but she was winning, and playing top 20 teams.
U bring in the other coach from Pepperdine Mark Trakh, who was using GObrecht’s recruits, was lucky for two years, then the wheels fell off LOL, he was let go. Now Michael Cooper is in ther and the prigram was in good standing, somewhat but he can’t do anything with the team. Mike Garrett & Lisa Love supposedly fired Chris Gobrecht, and both are NO LONGER a part of USC LOL, go figure! This program will forever be down trodden, the glory days of Cheryl Miller are long gone. USC had the chance with Chris Gobrecht, but blew it.
Not sure that Stefanie Gilbreath will return for her extra year. Ask Cooper why he let some of the best recruits leave southern California for UConn and Texas which would make a big difference. He needs to upgrade the coaching staff with someone who has been with a successful program that knows what it takes to be a contender.

After a decisive victory against No. 8 Texas last weekend, USC women’s tennis team dives back into Pac-12 play as it makes its first trips to visit Utah on Friday before heading to Colorado on Sunday.
Racketeer · The Women of Troy boast No. 18 Danielle Lao as well as three other players among the nation’s top-100 singles players. - Katherine Montgomery | Daily Trojan
 
The Women of Troy (12-2, 1-0) will brave the high altitude this weekend as they spar with two conference foes in unfamiliar territory. After dropping two spots in the ITA rankings, the Women of Troy have started their climb to the top, once again rising to No. 3 in the most recent polls.
Along with their top-three position as a team, USC also boasts four players among the nation’s top-100 singles including No. 18 junior Danielle Lao, a pair of freshmen in No. 21 Zoe Scandalis and No. 31 Sabrina Santamaria, and sophomore Kaitlyn Christian rounding out the quarter at No. 64.
Playing their fifth game against an opponent ranked among the nation’s top-10 teams, the Women of Troy started off strong, capturing the ever-elusive doubles point behind the strong play of the No. 4 squad of Christian/Santamaria and Scandalis/Pulido.
Riding the momentum of their doubles win, USC jumped out of the gates in the singles portion of the match with junior Valeria Pulido doubling up on wins Wednesday afternoon, notching her fifth straight win out of the No. 6 slot to put the Women of Troy up 2-0 in the match.
Following Pulido’s strong victory, USC got a dazzling effort from their two freshmen to close out the Longhorns early as Sabrina Santamaria scored a victory against Texas’ Noel Scott on court three and Zoe Scandalis took down No. 24 Aeriel Ellis in first singles to clinch the match 4-0.
While the Longhorns would recoup the next three points of the match with Kaitlyn Christian forced to retire in the midst of her third set against Cierra Gaytan-Leach following losses by Lao and freshman Gabriella DeSimone, their victories were in vain as the result of the match would remain unchanged.
Coming back to the West Coast, the Women of Troy will look to pick up some steam on the last leg of their road trip before returning home for the next two weeks.
Against Utah (8-5, 0-2), USC will force a team fresh off a victory against rival BYU and one looking for its first Pac-12 win of the season. After falling to perennial powers Stanford and Cal to open up the conference season, the Utes will once again have their hands full with the Women of Troy. Led by No. 63 Anastasia Putilina, Utah’s set to break their winless streak against USC as they are 0-2 in the all-time series, albeit both losses coming in California.
After facing the Utes, the Women of Troy will visit another mountain school to square off against Colorado in their first trip to Boulder. Sitting at 7-6, along with an 0-2 Pac-12 record, the Buffs, like Utah, have fallen to Stanford and Cal at the beginning of the year, but are coming off of a 7-0 win against Metro State. Looking for its first win against USC, Colorado hopes the altitude will give it the advantage against the Women of Troy.
Returning home after their three-game road trip will provide the Women of Troy with a nice break before they head north to take on Cal and Stanford in the coming weeks. Sitting at No. 3, USC is in an unfamiliar position as the favorite in almost every match and they will look to stay the course over the long, arduous Pac-12 season.

For all the spectacle and visual hyper-realization of theater and films these days, the play SEVEN proves the real power to tell a story lies in outstanding writing — executed here by seven excellent playwrights.
SEVEN is a self-billed documentary play centered on human rights and the women who defend them. Seven actors tell seven stories through a series of intertwined monologues about how each character finds ways to overcome poverty, government corruption, domestic violence and human trafficking. The documentary element is significant, as the playwrights spent a year with human rights workers from around the world, and the play is based on interviews with them.
Activism · SEVEN features the poignant — often graphic — stories of seven human rights workers across the globe. The minimalist design and staging of the production helps the semi-documentary script shine. - Anna Wierzbowska | Daily Trojan
SEVEN features representations of specific human rights workers from various locations: Hasfa Abiola, from Nigeria; Anabella de Leon, from Guatamala; Mu Sochua, from Cambodia; Farida Azizi, from Afghanistan; Inez McCormack, from Ireland; and Muktar Mai, from Pakistan.
Each has a unique story: Azizi is an Afghan refugee in the early 1990s who, outraged at the violent propaganda given to schools in her refugee camp, published her own, more peaceful textbooks to give the children. And McCormack is a self-confessed hippie living in violent 1970s Northern Ireland who falls for a Catholic and ends up opening the first women’s center in a troubled area.
The mix of biographical and political writing doesn’t feel overtly pushed as with, for example, Eve Ansler’s The Vagina Monologues. And despite a grim and depressing picture drawn by the stories told, audiences leave the production feeling inspired and yearning to help. Director Lora Zane states that her work is “cultural activism,” and her intentions certainly aren’t wasted in SEVEN.
[Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Aurora Levins Morales was the director. Lora Zane directed the play. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.]
The words of the characters are the point of the play, and the direction takes hold of this philosophy by allowing only a minimal amount of theatricality. The SEVEN actors are all austerely dressed in black, and the group is beautifully choreographed to allow a sense of movement and poetry to aid the words. When one character details his or her personal story, the others stand in various positions or transform into other characters in that particular monologue, helping to paint a more visual picture of each story.
The set is bare apart from a large screen that hovers above the actors. Aside from a few technical sound glitches, the screen proves its worth, especially during a scene with Mai (Sohina Sidhu), whose haunting gaze stares out at the audience as the actor below gives a horrific monologue about being raped in a small village in Pakistan. Music is used sparingly and the lighting is often composed of just a few spotlights that follow the actors.
This minimalist design is not new or uncommon, but it’s appropriate for a play like SEVEN, in which the script is so powerful and poetic that anything more would be distracting.
Unfortunately, there are distracting elements: The decorative proscenium and largeness of Bovard Auditorium, in which the one-time performance was held, led to a lack of intimacy.
The performances, save one crooked accent, were spot on. In particular, the sometimes-humorous Marlene Forte (de Leon) and intriguing Jeanne Sakata (Sochua) gave powerfully solid performances.
Though Sidhu struggled at a few points, she still had a captivating stage presence. The same is true of Chastity Doston (Abiola), whose account of her mother’s assassination was heartbreaking. Both these women are theatre majors from USC and held their own against the more experienced actors in the show; they clearly have enough talent to do some more remarkable work in the future.
The end of SEVEN leaves the audience with an on-screen interview with one of the real-life women, Sochua, who gives a few profound words. It would have been great to show all the women SEVEN was based on in this way, as it would show the reality of what the audience had just witnessed onstage.
These figures exist in the real world, and the world needs to hear their stories to inspire new ones:  As the character of Sochua says, “the war is never over.”
SEVEN focuses on a few remarkable women and does them justice; the show is a real testament to the idea that art can be the perfect platform to fight for social and political justice rather than just a medium solely for entertainment.
Hello,
My name is Meirav Rotstein and I was the stage manager for this production.  I wanted to point out a couple of mistakes int he article:
1) When you listed the women, you neglected to include Marina Piksklakova-Parker from Russia
2) The show was not directed by Aurora Levins Morales…  It was directed by L. Zane of the School of Theatre
3) You use Sohina’s name twice int he piece and her last name is spelled “Sidhu” not “Sidu”
Thanks,
Meirav

Some might say that the ’80s were a bad time for music, but five minutes of watching Rock of Ages, the riveting musical playing until March 25 at Pantages Theatre, would prove any naysayer wrong.
I love the ’80s · Justin Columbo (center) portrays Lonny Barett, Rock of Age’s narrator. The musical is an unbridled celebration of the ’80s rock ‘n’ roll culture, serving as an honorary tribute to the colorful decade. - Photo courtesy of Scott Suchman
The musical takes everything good about music in the ’80s and amplifies it. From the showy guitar solos to denim vests to hair-whipping that would make Willow Smith jealous, this musical covers all of the glam rock bases.
Set in Los Angeles, the show tells the tale of The Bourbon Room, a rock ‘n’ roll club on the Sunset Strip, and highlights the up-and-coming musicians that perform at the club.
The story follows Drew Dillenbeck (Dominique Scott), an aspiring rocker and employee of The Bourbon Room who finds love on his quest to become a famous musician.
This love interest is none other than Sherrie Christian (Shannon Mullen), an aspiring actress who waits tables at the venue. Unfortunately, both their dreams are put into question when The Bourbon Room falls into danger of being shut down by rich German moguls.
The result of this ode to the ’80s is a show that feels like a giant, face-melting arena rock concert: Every song energizes the audience and makes the theater feel like a stadium. With classics like “We’re Not Gonna Take It” and “I Wanna Rock,” audience members will walk away feeling like they’ve been transported back two decades to one of the most spectacular, entertaining concerts of their lives.
What really saves this show from coming off like a karaoke musical, however, is the gripping script, written by Chris D’Arienzo. The show could have easily fallen into nauseatingly campy clichés, yet D’Arienzo not only acknowledges these pitfalls as he breaks the fourth wall with the narrator but uses them to his advantage, often mocking the fact that the show is, in fact, a musical.
At one point, the narrator even stops to hand the main character a Rock of Ages playbill, telling Drew that “it’s the musical you’re in.” It’s sassy, well-defined characters and quippy lines like these that make Rock of Ages just as much about great comedy as about great music.
Of course, every production needs a great cast to bring a script to life, and Rock of Ages has exactly that. Every performer has not only the acting chops to bring their own quirks to the characters but also the necessary vocal chops to carry the huge songs that drive the musical.
Dominique Scott’s powerful Steve Perry-esque voice brings down the house, especially in the final number “Don’t Stop Believin’.” Justin Colombo also gives an unforgettable performance as Lonny Barnett, the show’s narrator, getting the audience in stitches with just a few words and facial expressions.
Steven Michael Kane’s wonderfully flamboyant and hilarious portrayal of Franz, the son of the evil German mogul Hertz Klinemann, is another standout.
He injects life into every single word he speaks, providing a stark — and hilarious — contrast to his militant father. Kane evoked raucous laughter from the audience with his hair flips and overzealous, slightly effeminate dance moves.
The production also has the added benefit of Adam John Hunter’s strong direction. Hunter had previously worked on seven different productions of Rock of Ages in various positions, and his familiarity with the show is apparent.
He is able to draw out nuanced performances through the show and smartly allows his actors to add elements that are not written into the script.
The staging, too, is efficient, clever and makes good use of the set design, which features the interior of The Bourbon Room as the main space. The stage is supplemented by a disappearing set piece that acts as a number of different rooms at different times, and an LED screen behind the set effectively provides any additional visuals needed to fill out the scene.
There’s really not much to complain about with Rock of Ages. The show has all the makings of a great modern musical — inspiring music, larger-than-life performances and a snappy book that pokes fun at the typical clichés inherent in musicals.
If Rock of Ages’ grungy ’80s charm doesn’t make viewers fall in love with glam rock, nothing will.

Sometimes, being a movie or television star is not enough. That is why several famous actresses leapfrog from their fame on-screen to pursue other interests and goals.
Though some actresses are content to branch out to producing or directing, a good number come to the conclusion that a music career is beckoning. And what follows tends to be formulaic and unsurprising.
It is not unusual for an attractive, young actress to also have a pretty decent singing voice. After all, as actors they are skilled in the art of performance. From there, all it takes is creating simple, catchy songs that will appeal to the masses.
The songs are usually anthemic, danceable, sugary-pop confections that are fun to listen to and sing along with but do not leave a lasting impact on the music scene. Typically, it will just come and go as one enjoyable fad.
Look no further than the career of Selena Gomez. Her songs are catchy and mainstream while appealing to a wide variety of demographics.
She probably won’t be considered one of music’s all-time greats, but her desire to start a music career is certainly not being met with opposition, and many listeners greet her songs with open arms.
The evidence speaks for itself: All three studio albums by Selena Gomez & the Scene have been certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America, and singles like “Love You Like a Love Song” and “Naturally” have been certified platinum.
But throughout the whole process, it just seems like the band’s ultimate goal is to have fun. And while there is nothing wrong with that, it does mean that the music lacks a certain amount of passion and creativity.
For Gomez, making music can take a backseat to acting, which is why she announced on her Facebook page in February that the band would be going on an indefinite hiatus.
“This year is all about films and acting,” Gomez wrote. “And I want my band to play music wherever with whoever. We will be back, but it will be a good while.”
The hiatus should not discredit the band’s discography, but it does show that she is ready to take a step back from it, putting the fad of Selena Gomez & The Scene on hold.
Other artists, however, would never dream of taking a break from music because they take it more seriously and see it as a way of life more than as just a hobby.
Taylor Momsen — formerly known for playing Jenny Humphrey on the TV show Gossip Girl and Cindy Lou Who in How the Grinch Stole Christmas — is now the lead singer of a hard rock band called The Pretty Reckless. She has given up her acting career to become a full-time recording and touring musician.
Momsen plays an integral part in the writing process for the band’s songs and has fully adopted the “bad girl” persona of a leading lady in rock ‘n’ roll.
If she is singing about love, then she references “late night sex [and] smoking cigarettes.” Her songs are not innocent, and they do not have mainstream appeal.
They sound closer to classic rock than anything released since the 1970s, and they feature fiercely aggressive melodic arrangements and guitar solos on top of Momsen’s raspy, often screaming vocals that sound like they are coming from the mouth of a 40-year-old seasoned rock veteran.
Whereas Gomez embraces her innocence, as many would expect her to, Momsen allows her inner troublemaker to drive her creativity, stirring up controversy and enjoying it. For instance, Momsen posed topless with porn star Jenna Haze in FHM magazine and performs songs wearing practically nothing but lingerie.
Some might call it an act, but the music certainly makes Momsen seem like the real deal. The Pretty Reckless’ Hit Me Like a Man EP, released March 6, is already shaping up to be one of the year’s best releases and the band just delivered an electrifying performance at the House of Blues Sunset Strip on March 14.
The songs might not be radio-friendly because of their mature subject matter and aggressive character, but they do something for Momsen that Gomez’s songs will never do: They cast Momsen as a rock star and a rabble-rousing lead singer.
Essentially, Momsen’s songs make you forget she was an actress. Gomez’s songs, meanwhile, remind listeners that she is an actress who just happens to write catchy songs on the side.
Actresses who follow in Gomez’s shoes are likely to create enjoyable songs that will ultimately have short-lived glory because other passions take them elsewhere soon enough.
The best acts to keep an eye on, then, are ones like Momsen who will fully immerse themselves in the music sphere, enabling them to keep growing and breaking down creative barriers instead of just doing what everyone else is already expecting them to do.

Great comparison of artists.  Well written article!
Who in Momsen’s camp wrote this ridiculous article?
Momsen’s music sounds NOTHING LIKE ‘classic rock”. It sounds like Avril Lavignes music circa 2004. Their music is generic, bland, cliche and highly unoriginal. She brings nothing new to he table. All she does is dish out every possible cliche “sex drugs & rock n roll” crap, that stopped being cool in he 80’s.
On top of that, her vocals are anything but impressive. She sounds like a dying rabbit. She forces her voice to sound “rock”, when she fails miserably and sounds like a screeching, screaming banchy- trying to play the role of “hardcore rocker”.
Taylor Momsen’s rock gimmick and terrible music is Avril Lavigne all over again. Recycled garbage.
you are an idiot, she has talent, she is really good, stop the hate, Avril Lavigne????, nothing like that, are you deaf
You’re actually the idiot. She has no musical talent. I have seen her live on 2 occasions, and all she did was screech her way (badly at that) through every song. She cannot sing, nor can she play guitar which was apparent when she got on stage and held it, rather than actually play it. All for looks sake of course.
Yes she IS like Avril Lavigne. You’re a moron to say otherwise. Same packaged manufactured “I am so rock even though I was never rock until my record label signed me” act. Same over produced pop rock sound (yet both thought they were death metal when the truth is they make POP ROCK songs). Both suck at singing and make bland music.
the new EP is called “Hit Me Like A Man,” not “Hit Me UP Like A Man.”
great article!

The game of politics is nasty, but many observers of the GOP presidential campaign think that it has gotten too nasty.
Though the rhetorical attacks leveled among the candidates may suggest a fractured Republican Party incapable of winning back the White House, it is more likely that attackers will ultimately rally support around the strongest candidate in November.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
During a conference at Southern Methodist University earlier this month, former First Lady Barbara Bush echoed the sentiments of many others, calling the current presidential race the worst she’s ever seen.
But political flame-throwing is nothing new, and, in what has been called a weak field of candidates, it should be welcomed as a way to separate the most presidential man from the pack. Though someone like Barbara Bush would point this out as being damaging to the Republican Party, it actually makes it easier to eliminate the incompetent candidates.
The stakes in this election are especially high. In a race composed of ideologically similar candidates, demeanor and the ability to gracefully sidestep petty attempts at character assassination will be especially important in determining who will be able to handle the presidency.
So far, Mitt Romney seems to have the most presidential deportment, something that will make him more electable in a face-off with incumbent President Barack Obama.
The most vitriolic candidate has been Newt Gingrich. He recently launched a Facebook page dedicated to disparaging Romney. The page, “Romney Record,” describes Romney as “liberal and out-of-touch” and does nothing but show that Gingrich is incapable of propping himself up based on his own accomplishments.
As Romney has continued to pull ahead of the pack in the delegate count, the trailing candidates have devoted more and more time to criticizing Romney.
During a CNN interview Wednesday, Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said that the former governor’s focus would shift “like an Etch-a-Sketch” come the general election. Though Fehrnstrom was referring to a more intense focus on Obama’s economic failures, Santorum and Gingrich seized on the opportunity to attack Romney. Gingrich twisted the adviser’s words during a speech in Louisiana and interpreted them as evidence that Romney will shift to the left.
Romney has not given in to these desperate attacks.
In a prolonged primary season, political smear tactics should be welcomed as ways to zero in on the candidate whose record and stances are enough to give Republicans a fighting chance of reclaiming the White House.
This election goes beyond the issues. To restore confidence in our nation, we need a confident president who will project an image of maturity and rationality rather than childishness and impetuosity.

Former First Lady Barbara Bush spoke the truth earlier this month when she called the 2012 presidential race “the worst campaign I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Though candidate mudslinging has been a major component of the American presidential contest about as long as the electoral college, it has grossly overstepped any reasonable limits in recent years. Now, the GOP primary has rendered itself an indecipherable mess and left the Republican Party a laughingstock in the eyes of moderates everywhere.
In the 11 weeks since the Republican primary began, each candidate has gotten caught up in the bashfest, and made a fool of himself in the process. Rick Santorum, for example, aired an embarrassingly farcical attack ad against Mitt Romney while campaigning in Michigan last month, complete with a slapstick soundtrack, a semi-automatic-toting Romney and a glistening cardboard cutout of Santorum.
Romney, the current Republican favorite, is equally guilty. A radio ad he debuted in Ohio on Super Tuesday featured an attack against Santorum for a 1998 vote to confirm Sonia Sotomayor to the federal circuit court. Sotomayor is now a Supreme Court Justice.
What’s troubling is that Romney’s ad doesn’t criticize this decision as being at odds with any particular Republican principal. Rather, it merely states that “29 of his Republican colleagues voted against her.” Romney has fallen into one of the worst traps for politicians today: putting the party above the platform.
The GOP candidates’ heavy reliance on super PACs further proves that this primary has become about slanderous advertisements rather than about how best to improve our country. It seems that the objective is to ditch any sort of individual view (and thus individual responsibility) in favor of appeasing the Republican machine. This explains why GOP candidates have such a long history of flip-flopping on issues such as gay marriage and abortion. It also threatens to leave us with a president who has no idea how to think for himself.
Statistically, all of this negativity, digression and general chaos has not left conservatives in a good place. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 49 percent of voters identifying as Democrats said that as they learn more about the GOP candidates, their impression of President Barack Obama is improving, up from 36 percent in December, before the primaries — and the nastiest campaigning — began. Meanwhile, a mere 26 percent of Republicans say their impressions of their candidates have improved.
The men competing in this primary have undermined the integrity of their own contest by ripping on each other, ripping on Obama and portraying Democrat-Republican compromise — the very basis of our law-making system — as some kind of evil.
Bush was right. This campaign is ugly. American voters must be cognizant of this issue and make sure the upcoming presidency doesn’t look even worse.

It’s springtime, which means there’s one thing on students’ minds: securing a coveted summer internship.
In today’s fiercely competitive job market, internship experience has become a necessity for students as opposed to a differentiating advantage.
For many students, unpaid internships are the only option.
Though the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does not track the number of unpaid internships, a survey conducted by the National Association of Colleges and Employers found that nearly 50 percent of internships held by graduating seniors in 2011 were unpaid.
Unpaid internships can be far from perfect, but they are often a necessary stepping-stone to better opportunities and, ultimately, a job.
To summarize requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act, unpaid internships must benefit the intern through training, the company cannot derive an immediate advantage from the intern’s activities and the internship should be considered an educational experience.
To make up for the lack of compensation, unpaid interns typically go through the tedious process of registering to receive college credit for their internship, where they end up actually paying to work.
So why are unpaid internships worth it?
Full-time and even paid internship employers typically look for candidates with skill sets obtained through previous work experience.
Working for free might seem rough, but if a student has had a blank résumé since high school graduation, chances are that landing a paid summer internship or full-time job would be extremely difficult.
Though they might not provide monetary compensation, unpaid internships provide value in other ways. They offer an inside view of an industry, allow students to grow their professional network and provide applicable skills that students might not learn in the classroom.
My first internship at a wealth management firm was unpaid and far from glamorous. Though I did spend time making copies and stuffing envelopes, I also made valuable connections within the firm, learned basic financial analysis and research skills and determined that wealth management wasn’t the right career for me.
There are scholarships that provide students who pursue certain kinds of unpaid internships with support. For example, the USC Dream Dollars program awards stipends for students pursuing internships in the government and non-profit fields.
Universities and government organizations should look to expand these scholarship opportunities to as many fields as possible, particularly in industries such as entertainment and journalism, where unpaid internships are the norm.
In recent years, the number of illegal internships has risen across the board. According to a 2010 article by The New York Times, violations by employers are widespread, but it’s hard to crack down when interns are fearful of filing complaints.
Though the government should certainly implement more specific, stringent legal requirements to reduce the prevalence of illegal unpaid internships, students can also take their own initiative.
To avoid a potentially miserable unpaid internship experience, students should research the opportunity thoroughly beforehand. Through a simple LinkedIn search, they can contact past interns to get direct feedback on the internship experience.
Students should also maintain an open dialogue during the interview process and ask interviewers candid questions about the day-to-day tasks they’ll be responsible for during the internship.
Unpaid internships don’t have to be characterized by making coffee and becoming a copy slave; there are many out there that provide valuable work experiences. Students should do everything they can to vet the internship beforehand, maximize their experience on the job and extract as much value as possible out of the internship by establishing connections.
Students should look at unpaid internships as a first step toward paid internship and employment opportunities. With my first internship under my belt, I was able to secure a more competitive, paid internship the following summer by showing my employer I was dedicated, willing to learn and already familiar with the workplace.
Government entities could certainly do better to create more specific compliance standards, and more scholarship opportunities for unpaid interns are definitely needed. But if students do their homework, take initiative on the job and view their internship as a learning opportunity rather than a burden, they’ll find that unpaid internships are often a worthy sacrifice.

Los Angeles Fashion Week was just amongst us. The nine-day event began March 9 and ended March 18th. The event tied fashion with television series’, charity associations and other cultural inspirations.
Friday wrapped up the event on a trendy note with the GO Red for Women Celebrity Red Dress Fashion Show for the American Heart Association. The fashion show bestowed the American Heart Association with generous offerings, while simultaneously satisfying those among the audience with a sweet tooth for high fashion and indulgent celebrity sighting.
Saturday’s runway was streamed live on KTLA5, the network that coincidentally airs the relevant Gossip Girl series, which inspired some of the event’s fashion collaborations such as GOSSIP GIRL BY ROMEO AND JULIET COUTURE.
Fashion, like art, has a history. Art is always “borrowed,” or influenced by another agent. And like art, trends in fashion repeat. While most fashion artists do not seem bothered by this habit of borrowing, other parties without trade name contracts have proven otherwise.
In February, Navajo Nation filed suit against Urban Outfitters in the U.S District Court in New Mexico claiming that last October, the clothing company refused to halt production of prints using the “Navajo name” and Native American designs, which falsely insinuated the tribes’ authentic making.
The Navajo Nation expressed their disappointment with the “derogatory and scandalous” panties selling five for $25 at Urban Outfitters.
In an interview on KPCC, President of Navajo Nation Ben Shelly says “we are very proud of our land and are proud of our heritage and who we are… it’s also called Navajo, that’s what we are, and we’re a sovereign government.”
Navajo Nation is the largest Native American tribe in the U.S.A. The reservation stretches across 2,000 square miles with more than 300,000 members in the states of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico.
President Shelley adds “Consultation is always our policy” and insists that, “if companies that are doing this would’ve come to the Navajo Nation, we may have some input. We may even help the businesses.”
Urban Outfitters is known to follow fashion trends as they come. And so, Shelley suggests that “how about (they) bring it on the reservation, (and) let the Navajo people make it for you, it will be authentic, and it will be made by Navajo.”
The Native-American trademark is copyrighted under the 12-year-old federal Indian Arts and Crafts Act.
But, where is the line drawn when it comes to art ‘borrowing?’
Would Pablo Picasso have fallen under illegal jurisdiction for his African-influenced artwork? How about the high-fashion designs by Rodarte last fall that brought “the world a Vincent Van Gogh Inspired Collection?”

It’s true that boy bands reached their peak of popularity in America during the 90s before fading out in the early 2000s. There has been the occasional resurgence with groups like the Jonas Brothers, V Factory, Big Time Rush and the fresher, less well-known Mindless Behavior. These artists, however, have not (and could not have) managed the feat of being the first UK group in history to debut at number one in the U.S. This success lies with Irish-British boy band One Direction, whose first album Up All Night debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 on March 21st, 2012. The band’s debut has even outshined the Spice Girls, the UK girl band that entered the American charts at number #6 with Spice in 1997.
The lead single on Up All Night, an up-tempo pop song called “What Makes You Beautiful,” debuted at #28 on the Billboad Hot 100 about a month ago.
The boy band, which is comprised of Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson, was formed during the seventh season of The X Factor and placed third at the end. The five members had originally applied as solo candidates in 2010, but at the suggestion of judge Simon Cowell, they were formed into a boy band. After the end of the season, One Direction was signed to Syco Music, a joint deal label under Sony Music Entertainment.
The burst of popularity for the band has garnered them numerous perks, including support from famous American artists such as Justin Bieber and Katy Perry, being guest stars on the Today show, scheduled appearances on Saturday Night Live, the 2012 Kids’ Choice Awards and iCarly and rumors of a television show on Nickelodeon (to the dismay of many fans).
The boy band will also have their first North American Tour starting May 24th at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, Virginia. If the band is lucky, or perhaps talented enough, this One Direction mania w   ill develop into a more substantial and long-lasting fan loyalty. For better or for worse, maybe their popularity will mark the beginning of a new boy band craze.
