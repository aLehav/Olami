We live in a stop-and-go world. Much of our day is predetermined with a set routine and, at times, we can become so robotic that we forget to set aside time for ourselves. Since it is a new semester, our routine might have changed a bit, but for me I still seem to need to stop, take a step back and remind myself that I am important and I deserve to take time to treat myself like I am. I have coined this ability of knocking out self-deprecation and not enough self-respect as being deliciously kind to myself.
Our generation tends to do a lot of hate talk. I’m too this, too that, not tall enough not skinny enough. We feel guilty for little things like eating that chocolate cake for dessert or looking at our bodies with a negative eye. We deprive ourselves from loving who we are — and I think that needs to change. Taking on the ability to be deliciously kind is a bit difficult as it means we must try our best to be mindful and present as often as we can be. It seems so simple and easy to live in the moment, but in actuality it is an ever-evolving practice with our minds.
Start the mindset change by deleting that “all-or-nothing approach.” We seem to see a lot of the world as being black or white. You mess up on that test and, oh no, your life is over. You get in a fight with someone you care about — your relationship is ruined. You eat that cookie — you’re so unhealthy. You are not doing yourself any favors with this negative, definitive thinking. Try not to let your fear of not doing things absolutely “perfectly” hold you hostage any more. Take each challenge you come across and create small goals and remember to celebrate the small victories along the way. Nothing is ever going to be perfect and the sooner you can accept that then the happier you will be.
Embrace things for what they are — enjoy what you are eating and what you are doing. Ever too often, people on the path to better health, physically and mentally, assume they’ll have to deprive and restrict themselves all of the time. This is false. Do small things with great pleasure and really soak it all in- that is important if you want to treat yourself with delicious kindness!
Lastly, let yourself relax sometimes. We really are our own biggest critics. Take breaks when you need to. Go chill in the quad and take in the beautiful things around you. Life can become overwhelmingly crazy and if you don’t stop and just let yourself feel than you are going to miss it all. Treat yourself to splurges once in a while and don’t over think it. Remind yourself that you are important, loved and an amazing person. Take care of yourself because you are so, so special and deserve to be treated in that way.
If you’re ready to fully experience a life filled with deliciousness, nourishment and self-love, then make room for you. Embrace each possibility of the day as your own and continuously remind yourself that you are enough.

Leading up to my flight across the Pacific Ocean to start my semester abroad, I had no idea what to feel about my (then) upcoming trip to Tokyo and no clue what sort of atmosphere I should expect to feel from the city.
At this point, a solid 12 hours have gone by since my plane touched down at Haneda International Airport and so far, Japan seems less like a foreign territory to me than it does a long lost cousin. Though it’s my first time in Japan, the scenery that slipped by during my bus ride to my hotel reminded me of previous trips to South Korea to visit extended family.
Sarah Joh | Daily Trojan
But before I go on — some background. I’m here in Japan for the first two and half weeks of what you could consider an unconventional study abroad semester. These upcoming weeks with Keio University comprise the first portion of the East Asia Three-Campus program, which is new to USC this academic year. After my time in Japan is over, I’ll be off to spend a semester at Yonsei University in Seoul, and then taking off again to spend my summer at Hong Kong University. My time in East Asia will be a truly comparative experience, but for now, my focus is on Tokyo, without any distractions.
Due to its sheer size, what I’ve seen of Tokyo so far is limited to a small corner of Shinagawa ward where my hotel is. The closely packed buildings and narrow streets are true to my expectations, but thanks to being here in person, I’ve been able to fill in the bits and pieces that help define and distinguish Japan from the United States. So far, I’ve noticed obvious things, such as how drivers take the wheel on the right side of a car (as opposed to the left) and slightly less apparent things, such as how people appear to take their left side when walking in a given direction, instead of the right.
Sarah Joh | Daily Trojan
A quick reminder to those who plan to travel or study abroad in the future — make sure to read up on the basic social customs of your intended area of travel. In addition to soaking in the novel details of my surroundings, I’ve also managed to commit a faux pas throughout this first day by handing documents and money directly to clerks when paying for things, instead of placing them into the small trays present, as I should have. I’m trying to catch up on Japanese social customs as quickly as I can, but luckily in the mean time, the people around me are gracious about the mistakes I find myself making.
Even within the 16 days I will be in Tokyo, I doubt I’ll be able to even touch the tip of the iceberg of what it has to offer. Tokyo spans an area about twice the size of Los Angeles and houses over thirteen million people (compared to L.A.’s population of approximately four million). Despite such differences typical of any large metropolitan area, Tokyo is divided into distinct wards that each have their own distinct qualities and famed attractions, much like how L.A. is divided into areas such as West Hollywood and Downtown.
That being said, with the limited time I have, I can’t wait to get to know Tokyo as much as I possibly can.

If you’re looking to venture off campus to explore Los Angeles one weekend or if you just want to be more active, look no further. Listed here are the best hikes in Los Angeles, based on my personal experience and general popularity. Disclaimer: None of these hikes are located just a few miles from campus, so be sure to look into transportation options.
1. Sandstone Peak
Distance from USC: 45 miles
Difficulty: Moderate, 7 miles round trip
As the highest point in the Santa Monica Mountains, Sandstone Peak boasts a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean and the surrounding mountains. I recommend going super early —around 4 a.m. — to make it to the top as the sun is rising (and to avoid traffic). Nothing beats a great view and cotton candy skies.

2. Cucamonga Peak
Distance from USC: 55 miles
Difficulty: Hard, 12 miles round trip
The awesome pictures you can get at the top of this incredibly challenging hike make it one of my top two hikes of all time. DO IT FOR THE INSTA. But warning you right now, this hike isn’t for the inexperienced. I made that mistake and suffered accordingly the next day when I couldn’t move my body. Besides that though, Cucamonga Peak gives you an awesome view of L.A. from the San Gabriel Mountains.

3. Hollywood Sign
Distance from USC: 10 miles
Difficulty: Easy, 3.5 miles round trip
Would this list even be valid if it didn’t include the Hollywood Sign hike? A great hike for the casual walkers and the experienced, there are several routes to the top. All three routes take you to the back of the sign, which you will not be able to touch just fyi. If you want to get a picture with the Hollywood Sign in the background, you need to do it near the beginning of the hike. It won’t be too hard to figure out; everyone else is doing the same.

4. Solstice Canyon/Rising Sun Trail
Distance from USC: 30 miles
Difficulty: Easy, 3 miles round trip
A fairly popular hike, Solstice Canyon is located in the heart of Malibu. After walking on a trail of shady trees for a short period of time, you will find yourself at the ruins of a 1950s mansion. Explore the mansion or check out the adjacent mini waterfalls for a relaxing experience. If you want to take a more challenging route (where you won’t be blessed with as much shade), check out the Rising Sun Trail. It’s slightly longer but gets you to the same waterfall area.

5. Runyon Canyon
Distance from USC: 12 miles
Difficult: Easy, 3 miles
Arguably the most popular hike in L.A. (and for good reason), Runyon Canyon attracts all types of people: celebs, dog-lovers, and yoga gurus alike. WARNING: Due to the extreme popularity of Runyon Canyon, finding parking is nearly impossible. Either go at an odd time or park in a structure close by. But, trust me, the incredible view of L.A. and the Hollywood Sign makes the hassle worthwhile.

Jasmine Li | Daily Trojan
On the morning of Jan. 3, I found myself in the heart of Kanazawa City doing a sort of hop-skip on the snow, trying to keep my boots from sinking in too deep. Kanazawa is known for being a treasure chest of relics dating back to Edo period Japan, when it was part of a fief held by the fabulously wealthy Maeda Daimyo.
One of these relics is Kanazawa Castle, which was towering above me, occasional snowfalls hurtling down from its rafters to land with a thud on the frozen moat below. I bought two tickets — one for me, the other my friend — from the smiling lady at the counter and headed in through the open doors.
Inside, the wooden walls and floors were well-kept and gleaming with polish. It would be impossible to believe, even for a second, that Kanazawa Castle stands today as it did in 1583, the year it was first established by the Maeda. Indeed, it has been destroyed and rebuilt numerous time, hapless victim to the ravages of time, invasions, fires, and earthquakes. Most of what is available to present-day visitors was constructed in 2001, and all around the exhibition halls were signs and placards identifying various features of the architecture, including what it was used for and how it was reconstructed. I paused my restless pacing to gaze, fascinated, down a row of narrow slits in the floor, which were used back in the day to hurl rocks at invading samurai.
I climbed up the turret, which opened out onto a wide view of the castle grounds. I looked at the trees, the ponds, the neighboring buildings, squinting slightly because the early noon sun reflected off the snow in piercing needles of light. In the distance, the apartment buildings and business district of the modern half of Kanazawa could be seen. I wondered how it would have felt to stand here in the seventeenth century, with the tiny toy houses in the distance changed into an invading army. I smile a bit to myself and turn to descend.
In the afternoon, I took a walk around Kenroku-en, arguably the number one attraction of Kanazawa. It used to be a private garden for the sole enjoyment of the Maeda, but now it is a public park, accessible to the masses for under five dollars. (In celebration of New Year’s, it was offering free admission, so I was able to waltz in without so much as pulling a cent out of my pocket.)
Small forests, streams, and waterfalls flowed in and out of the landscape, and I paused on a bridge, staring down at the water, which I knew would be full of koi fish once summer rolled around again. Continuing through a grove, wincing and ducking under my umbrella whenever a crow perched on branches dripping with snow, I came out onto the main pond. Beside it a stone lantern was perched gracefully on two legs — Kotoji Toro, the prized symbol of both Kenroku-en and Kanazawa. Behind me, a spray of water wobbled slightly as it bravely reached for the sky — built in 1861, it is said to be the oldest fountain in Japan.
My favorite part of the garden, however, is a great statue, turned green with age, that stakes its claim on a throne of rocks. The giant metal face, however, is not that of one of the Maeda leaders (as I once mistakenly believed) but of Yamato Takeru, a legendary prince whose story is told in the two oldest chronicles of Japan, the Kojiki (712) and the Nihon-Shoki (720) — both of which are more myth than history. He is said to have been a fierce warrior, so brutal that he slew his older brother when the latter failed to come down to dinner. His father, the emperor Keikō, fearing the terrible power of his son, sent him from the castle, ostensibly to conquer the warrior tribes scattered throughout the land. He has since become an important symbol, carved from Japan’s mythic past of gods, beasts and warriors.
That day, I gazed up at him, smiling a little at the round cap of snow perched on top of his head. Whether he was real or not, to me, he remains an important historical figure — a cruel but awesome ideal from long ago. I gazed at the pond frosted with white, the bent grandmothers and grandfathers taking their afternoon stroll around the peaceful grounds of the garden) and couldn’t help but think that though Japan has drifted a long way from its belligerent samurai days, it still sets my imagination running when I find, buried under layers of soft, fresh-fallen snow, the strong features of Prince Yamato Takeru.
