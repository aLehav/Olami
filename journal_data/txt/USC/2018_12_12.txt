Los Angeles police found nude photos of women in a storage unit owned by former USC gynecologist George Tyndall during an investigation into his activities, the Los Angeles Times reported Tuesday.
“Some time in June or July LAPD served a search warrant where additional evidence was located, and this is still an ongoing investigation,” Los Angeles Police Department confirmed in a statement to the Daily Trojan.
In an interview with the Times, LAPD Capt. Billy Hayes said that most photos depicted women not connected to the University, although some appeared to depict women in medical examination rooms. Hayes said detectives are determining whether the images were taken at clinic appointments on campus although the victims are difficult to identify because some photos date back decades. 
After Tyndall’s departure in June 2016, USC administrators found photos in his office and conducted an independent investigation, through which they determined that the photos were clinical. Several plaintiffs stated in their lawsuits against Tyndall that he allegedly took photos during their medical examinations. 
These findings are relevant to Tyndall’s alleged sexual misconduct toward female students over his near 30-year career at USC, which the LAPD is investigating. Hundreds of women have come forward with complaints against the former gynecologist since the Times published a report in May detailing Tyndall’s alleged actions. In October, the University agreed to a $215 million settlement for a federal class-action lawsuit filed by former patients of Tyndall.
Attorney Annika Martin, who represents victims in the federal class-action, said that previous allegations of such photos in Tyndall’s possession were taken into account when negotiating the settlement in October.
“I think that a piece of it goes into part of the harm that was inflicted on his patients by him both while they were in the room and now after the fact finding out that they were photographed without their consent,” Martin said. “It adds more improper conduct to the mix, certainly.”
Those included in the federal class-action lawsuit received a minimum of $2,500 for coming forward. Plaintiffs who provided more information in writing or via interview received up to $250,000.
“We’ve structured the settlement in a way that allows for choice and also allows for women who feel comfortable and are ready to choose to provide more information about what happened to them and how it impacted them,” Martin said. “I certainly think in that piece of the process the photographs and finding out about the nonconsensual photographs will certainly be part of the picture and will play into the assessment of each woman’s claim.”
Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 54 victims in litigations against Tyndall and USC, said some of her clients gave Tyndall permission to take photos that he claimed would be used for treatment or research. She said her clients fear Tyndall may have taken photos of them without consent and posted these images online for pornographic purposes. 
“I believe that it’s a gross invasion of privacy,” Allred said. “If in fact these were photos of his patients from USC or from anywhere, and it certainly heightens the fear that many of our clients have and the emotional distress that our clients have had and still have.”
Other lawyers representing victims echo similar sentiments. Attorney Andy Rubenstein said that about 10 of his 100 clients said Tyndall took photos of them at a clinic, under the pretense that they would be used for medical or research purposes. But Rubenstein said his clients never saw the photos in their medical charts. 
“He was a doctor at the time, and they trusted him, and when he explained that he was taking these photos for their chart to be able to compare and look at photos now versus photos later to see if there’s been any growth or changes in the tissue, all of that sounded reasonable under the circumstances,” Rubenstein said. “But when they looked at their charts later, none of them contained any photos, which is suspect in and of itself.”
Rubenstein said the discovery of photos in Tyndall’s storage unit confirms his belief that the gynecologist never took these photos for medical or research purposes.
Attorney John Manly, who represents more than 200 victims, said many of his clients want to know if their photos were found in the storage unit, and whether they were distributed on the internet. He said he and his clients think Tyndall may have used the images for self-gratification or sold them. 
“Many of these women now are in their 40s and some are in their 50s,” Manly said. “They’re wondering, ‘Are my children going to wake up one day and see my naked image on the internet?’ This is a violation of your personal space, your privacy. It’s humiliating; it’s shameful.”
So far, detectives have questioned at least 117 women and presented 85 cases in connection with Tyndall to the Los Angeles County district attorney’s sex crimes unit, according to the L.A. Times. 
Tyndall’s attorney, Leonard Levine, told the Daily Trojan the new allegations do not constitute criminal behavior; the LAPD does not consider the possession of such photos a crime.
“None of the items allegedly seized, according to the report, involve criminal conduct of any kind,” Levine said. “Dr. Tyndall remains adamant that he engaged in no criminal conduct while he was employed as a physician at USC.”
A grand jury is currently hearing evidence on Tyndall’s case, although the Times reported that it is unclear whether the contents found in Tyndall’s storage unit will be entered as evidence. 
USC Gould School of Law professor Orin Kerr said the images and videos could be used as evidence as long as they have been lawfully obtained. 
“It could depend on exactly what he is charged with, but assuming it is misconduct with respect to his patients and the pictures are showing the misconduct with the patients that would certainly be relevant,” he said.
Kerr said that hard drives obtained from the storage unit could also be helpful in the investigation. 
The University said it will continue to stand behind the USC community.
“USC has cooperated with LAPD’s investigation since its inception and will continue to do so,” the University said in a statement. “That cooperation includes our assurance not to comment on any aspect of their investigation. Our priority continues to be supporting our students, patients and entire university community by helping to bring resolution to this painful experience in a manner that respects the dignity and privacy of all of those impacted.”

The USC Board of Trustees announced its support of the decision to terminate Marshall School of Business Dean James Ellis after a three-hour board meeting Wednesday. The meeting followed after protests from students, faculty, staff and alumni who said Ellis’ term was wrongfully cut short.
“Following previous board discussions in October and November, today Interim President Wanda Austin presented to the executive committee and to the full Board of Trustees the facts in the matter involving USC Marshall School of Business Dean Jim Ellis,” the Board of Trustees wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. 
Nearly 30 students, faculty, staff and alumni gathered outside Bovard Auditorium to protest Austin’s decision before the board meeting. Protestors wore “I Stand with Dean Ellis” shirts and held “I Love Dean Ellis” signs.
Thomas Papa, former president of the Marshall Alumni Association, attended the rally and said he hopes that the Board of Trustees will disclose more information regarding the grounds for Ellis’ termination to the public.
“It’s hard to understand why the decision by the interim president was made,” Papa said. “I hope that’s the first thing that comes out — that we get some facts. Secondly, [I hope] that there is a way forward to keep Ellis as the dean of the business school until sometime when he wants to step down voluntarily.”
Ellis announced in an email to the USC community last week that he would step down in June 2019. He said administration reached the decision from records of complaints against Marshall faculty and staff from the Office of Equity and Diversity. 
“This is surprising and disappointing,” said Skip Miller, an attorney representing Ellis. “There’s never been any hint that Jim Ellis personally did anything wrong, and he hasn’t. In fact, he’s responsible for putting the Marshall school on the map.” 
This is the USC community’s second rally calling for greater University transparency and due process regarding the decision to terminate Ellis in June 2019, three years before the end of his contracted term. 
Currently, a petition on Change.org directed to Austin and Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso has garnered over 2,830 signatures by the time of publication. 
Lloyd Greif, benefactor of the USC Marshall Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, said the second rally was intended to grab the attention of the Board of Trustees and ask for their support before they heard Austin’s reasoning behind the decision. 
“The only difference [at] the rally today [was] as trustees walked by, we tried to get their attention and talk to them to try and let them know that [Ellis] is a good dean and he should stay,” Greif said. “On Friday, there were no trustees around. That was more about the administration.”
Greif said that by approving Austin’s decision, the Board of Trustees demonstrated a lack of transparency, shared governance and due process.
“It’s a sad day for USC,” Greif said. “I think transparency, due process and shared governance died in the boardroom today at USC. For them to support the decision made by the interim president to remove this dean when that decision was criticized by the academic senate for lack of transparency and a lack of shared governance, they just rubber-stamped that lack of transparency [and] lack of shared governance.”
Sonny Astani, benefactor of the USC Sonny Astani Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the Viterbi School of Engineering, criticized the lack of due process regarding the University’s handling of Ellis’ firing in a letter he wrote to the USC community. 
“All of us in the USC community who are concerned about the treatment of Dean Ellis have no choice but to demand a full accounting of how the Dean’s dismissal was judged and adjudicated,” Astani wrote. “If the Dean’s ‘punishment’ does indeed fit his ‘crime,’ so be it. If the Dean broke the rules, so be it. Let the rules of our university speak loud and clearly. But if Dean Ellis was terminated on account of rules that were suddenly created on the spot, this should be revealed.”
Astani also expressed concern over some of the members on the Board of Trustees, who he believes are straying away from University values.
“Being on USC’s Board of Trustees is not a license to use the Board for a platform of political gain outside the University … Great Board of Trustees are known for their focus on the universities they serve,” Astani wrote. “It is time for the Board to serve the University and to fully disclose the process that led to Dean Ellis’s dismissal. If the standard of evidence is lacking, Dean Ellis’s termination must be rescinded, immediately.”
Greg Autry, assistant clinical professor at the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, said he fears that the Marshall school could be negatively affected if the Board of Trustees does not release more information on Ellis’ termination and the charges against him.
“We would expect that they would have had to frankly put up or shut up,” Autry said. “They should have to show the evidence of why this decision was made or I think they might’ve had to find a compromise. If they don’t do that, if they continue to force [this on] the Marshall school with no explanation… I’m very concerned about what it will do with alumni, donors and faculty morale.”
However, some members of the USC community agree with the Board’s decision in light of the OED complaints the Marshall school received. 
“I hope the Board’s concurrence with Dr. Austin renews the campus’ resolve to promote accountability and foster a proactive campus culture,” said Alec Vandenberg, a junior majoring in public policy. 
Edward Mack, a junior majoring in international relations, said the arguments questioning Austin’s authority as interim president are unfounded. 
“Some argue that because she’s only an Interim President, she does not have the authority to take an action such as this one,” Mack said. “I say this is ridiculous: if that goes beyond her authority, then her title should be changed from ‘Interim President’ to ‘Figurehead,’ as that’s essentially what her role becomes.”
Mack said it is Austin’s obligation to execute these decisions during her term, even though her position is temporary.
“The responsibility of an Interim President isn’t to sit by and do nothing, particularly at a time in which the University has been rocked by scandal after scandal,” Mack said. “President Austin was brought in as a direct response to the growing number and depth of these scandals … Serious and fundamental change was and is necessary to achieve this goal, but it is imperative that we do not shy away when these changes might be painful.”

The last of four defendants was charged with first-degree murder Wednesday for the 2014 death of graduate student Xinran Ji.
Alberto Ochoa, 21, will be sentenced in March after being convicted of murder, assault with a deadly weapon, second-degree robbery and attempted second-degree robbery, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said in a news release. 
“We certainly feel very rewarded and consoled [with] the fact that the last [defendant] is also being convicted by the jury,” said Rose Tsai, the attorney for Ji’s family. “Xinran’s parents … feel very grateful to the verdict they had learned yesterday.”
Ji was attacked with an aluminum bat and wrench during an attempted robbery in July 2014 while walking to his apartment from a study group around 1 a.m., the Daily Trojan previously reported. 
According to the news release, Ochoa struck Ji with a bat. Ji tried to run, but one of Ochoa’s co-assailants caught up and struck him repeatedly. Ji was found dead in his apartment by his roommate hours later.

Christopher Chaney, the attorney representing Ochoa, said he disagrees with the conviction and will file for appeal after sentencing. 
“I’ve been with Mr. Ochoa since he was 17 years old, and he’s been very sorry about what happened to Mr. Ji,” Chaney said. “It’s been our position that he did not contribute to the actual death of Mr. Ji, but he has recognized that he was a participant.”
Ochoa’s co-defendants Alejandra Guerrera and Andrew Garcia were convicted and sentenced for first-degree murder, robbery, attempted robbery and assault with a deadly weapon in October 2016 and August 2017, respectively. They are facing life in prison without parole. Jonathan Del Carmen, who pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last year, was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. 
Tsai said Ji’s parents traveled to California in 2017 to attend Garcia’s conviction and thank the community for their support over the years. Since Ji’s death, Tsai said international students have expressed that they think public safety practices and awareness have improved.
“The other consolation that Xinran’s parents had felt when they were here last year that was the pay back they received from the community that Xinran’s case has brought more awareness and has brought changes in a positive way to public safety and security for society,” Tsai said. “The last thing they want is for their son to die in vain.”
