Last year, the USC men’s volleyball team got swept in three quick sets at Pepperdine.
It might be a little bit different this time around.
Teamwork · Junior setter Riley McKibbin sets up junior middle blocker Austin Zahn for the spike. The two were a part of a talented recruiting class that has helped the Trojans acheive the nation’s top ranking. - Katelynn Whitaker | Daily Trojan 
“That [loss] is in the back of everyone’s mind,” junior outside hitter Murphy Troy said.
The Trojans (6-1, 4-0) come into the match at Pepperdine’s Firestone Fieldhouse tonight as the top-ranked team in the nation, while the No. 11 Waves (1-4, 1-3) are reeling from the loss of their superstar. 
Even though the Waves finished second in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation last year, they lost 2009 National Player of the Year and three-time All-American Paul Carroll to graduation and are struggling to learn a new, quicker offense.
But the Trojans aren’t taking the Waves lightly; they know it’s not easy playing at Pepperdine.
“It’s one of the toughest environments in NCAA volleyball and Pepperdine’s the kind of school and program you can’t underestimate,” junior outside hitter Tri Bourne said.
That said, the Trojans come into the match boasting the best record in the MPSF, and they are off to their best start since 2000. They have five returning starters from last year’s squad, which beat Pepperdine in the MPSF Championship.
USC could get another victory if it pulls out the win tonight — albeit only a mental victory.
“We divided our season into three segments, and Friday will be the final piece of the first segment,” USC coach Bill Ferguson said. “If we could finish the first third being undefeated in the league, that’s going to be a huge deal.”
One of the bright spots for the Trojans during the first third of the season has been Bourne. Bourne was part of the talented recruiting class that included 2009 All-American Troy and 2009 third team All-Americans, junior setter Riley McKibbin and junior middle blocker Austin Zahn.
Yet Bourne was hampered by injuries in his first two seasons. He missed the fall of his freshman year due to appendicitis, and he missed significant time the summer and fall of his sophomore year with a herniated disc.
This is the first time Bourne has been able to train year-round, and it’s paying off. Bourne has a .345 hitting percentage and averages 3.23 kills per game, which are both well above his career average.
With other teams focusing on Troy, Bourne can take advantage and punish the opposition.
“He’s an unbelievably talented young man,” Ferguson said. “He’s as good an outside hitter as anyone in the country. He’s just been sitting in the weeds the past few years.”
With a healthy Bourne, the Trojans have improved a lot over the first two weeks of the season in the serving and passing category.
Blocking, however, is an area the team realizes it needs to improve upon.
USC has been out-blocked in the last two matches, which have been sweeps. While the Trojans focused on offense the first part of the season, the team turned its attention to defense this week as they worked on blocking.
Ferguson isn’t too worried about the team’s problems in the blocking category as it is built to succeed without needing to block.
“Part of what we do is not play to get the stuff block — we’re a better digging and transition team right now,” Ferguson said. “We’ve been so good over the past few years defensively digging the ball.”
Also, the fact that the Trojans get a lot of aces — USC is third in the MSPF averaging 1.46 aces per game — means that there’s less opportunities to block balls.
If the Trojans can step it up defensively, they will be tough to beat. But they know that Pepperdine has the talent to be a very competitive team.
“They’re going to be heard from and that’s the scary thing about them,” Ferguson said. “They have unbelievably talented players, it’s just a matter of when they put things together.”

As the first Grand Slam of the professional season winds to a close at the Australian Open, The No. 1 men’s tennis team will commence play during one of the “Grand Slams” of college tennis Saturday and Sunday in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association’s Kick-Off Weekend.
Ready · Senior Robert Farah and the Trojans host three top teams. - Sunil Murali | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (2-0, 0-0) will host a four-team qualifying tournament Saturday and Sunday against No. 49 Vanderbilt University (3-1, 0-0), No. 70 Radford University (0-2, 0-0) and No. 73 Yale University (0-0, 0-0). The winner of this kick-off tournament will go on to compete in the 16-team ITA National Team Indoor Championships at Charlottesville, Va. from Feb. 12 to Feb. 15.
Radford faces off against Yale at 8:30 a.m. to begin the day’s play, and USC starts it Saturday match against Vanderbilt at 11:30 a.m. The winners of each match will compete for a bid to Charlottesville on Sunday at 1 p.m.
With all of the interruptions in the team’s schedule, USC coach Peter Smith believes this tournament is an excellent opportunity to pick up momentum against the best competition collegiate tennis has to offer.
“We look at it as the start of the season where you have the top-60 teams in the country all playing the same weekend,“ Smith said. “Kind of a cool way to start the season.“
The very competitive Vanderbilt squad, coming off a close (4-3) loss to No. 41 University of Michigan, will be the Trojans’ first opponents at the Kick-Off event. The Commodores have three singles players ranked in the top 75 and three ranked doubles duos.
Win or lose, the Trojans will play on Sunday against either Radford or Yale. Radford opened its season with two losses to ranked teams and boasts No. 66 singles player junior Ivan Salec.
USC opened the season with two wins against Loyola Marymount and UC Santa Barbra, where the Trojans were able to give all team members a chance to compete.
Now that the season is underway, Smith will change his approach in order to soldify his lineup.
“Time to lay the best guys out there and get some experience,“ Smith noted.
Freshman J.T. Sundling has been medically cleared to begin practice today after a bout with mononucleosis. Smith plans to ease him into playing shape, but Sundling’s presence will help in finalizing the lineup, especially in doubles. With some questions left to be answered, the Trojans hope to advance and prove themselves against the top teams in the nation at the ITAs.

The USC women’s swimming and diving team will face top Pac-10 rivals California and Stanford at the McDonald’s Swim Stadium Friday and Saturday, with the Women of Troy eager to set the pace against some of the toughest competition they have faced this season.
Quick starts · The USC women’s swimming team will host two dual meets in less than 24 hours. After  losing a large contingent of seniors, the Women of Troy will rely heavily on their young swimmers for points. - Eric Burse | Daily Trojan 
“The fun thing about this weekend is that this is perhaps the most evenly matched competition between the three different schools in the last four to five years,” USC assistant coach Jeremy Kipp said.
Cal, the reigning NCAA champions, is out for revenge after last year’s dual meet in Berkley, when the Women of Troy ran up a victorious score on a stunned Bears squad.
“We are going to do what we can to take a few wins and make it close,” USC coach Dave Salo said. “With the graduation of Rebecca Soni, Katy Houston, Kristen Lahey and Rachael Waller, we are going to rely on a very young team to follow up with last year’s upset win over Cal.”
The battle against Stanford will be another story, however, as the Trojans are looking to close the gap on the No. 4 team. Last year’s meet came down to the last few races, so this time the team will have to get off the walls fast and finish hard if they hope to capture victory.
“Stanford is undefeated this season and looks to be among the favorites to win the NCAA championships this year,” Salo said. “We are excited and ready to compete with both teams.”
The competition will also mark the last dual meet for senior captains Dina Hegazy and Krissy Forelli. Both women were All-Americans at last year’s NCAAs and will be looking to make the championship team once again this season.
The Trojans to watch on both days will be sophomore Katinka Hosszu, junior Lyndsay DePaul and freshman Haley Anderson. Hozzsu and DePaul are among the best all-around swimmers in the NCAA and will be important in the distance, medley and sprint events. Anderson has proven herself to be USC’s leading distance lady, and the team will be looking to her to start off the meet with a win.
Sophomore diver Victoria Ishimatsu will be another key competitor for the Trojans on both days, particularly against Stanford, which has one of the top diving teams in the country.
“One area to watch and will be critical are the divers,” Kipp said. “We could possibly go a 1-2-3 sweep in both boards, which would be a huge advantage.”
Although USC will rely heavily on the high-scoring teammates, what will ultimately dictate the outcome will be the smaller, yet valuable, efforts of the swimmers fighting for third, fourth and fifth, where points can add up and ultimately decide competitions.
“The meet will be won on freshmen like Jessie Schmitt and Christel Simms who will need to step up big time,” Kipp said.

Somewhere in the world, a 6-foot-4, 300-pound man is probably smiling.
At the same time, dozens of people much smaller are smiling as well.
The cause for joy is the same, but the reasoning is completely different.
Why? Tomorrow is the Senior Bowl, the Super Bowl of scouting (until the NFL Combine next month).
The larger man is smiling because he’s not there. The smaller people are smiling because of everyone who is.
It’s a tale of two smiles — or something like that.
If you haven’t guessed by now, the defensive tackle-sized man is, in fact, a defensive tackle. He’s Ndamukong Suh, the former Nebraska defensive tackle and can’t-miss prospect. Suh is probably smiling because he has to do little more than show up in New York City on Thursday, April 22, for the NFL Draft. 
NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has probably already written these words on a note card somewhere to practice: “With the first pick in the 2010 NFL Draft, the St. Louis Rams select Ndamukong Suh, defensive tackle, Nebraska.”
And barring incredibly unforeseen circumstances, months of practicing those words should pay off.
Suh is probably smiling because he hasn’t had to endure the stress of this past week of practices, which culminates in tomorrow’s Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. He hasn’t had to worry about footwork, arm strength, explosion off the ball or coverage skills.
No, Suh just has to make sure his suit is tailored, his tie is properly tied and his shirt isn’t wrinkled.
While he plans his wardrobe, dozens of his peers are busting their butts in Mobile to prove to scouts and experts that they can play at the professional level.
And that’s where the other group of smiling people comes in.
For the countless draft gurus who report back to teams, news outlets and their own personal blogs, the Senior Bowl is a weeklong party. It’s time to dust off the big boards, sharpen the mock drafts and brush up on trade value charts.
It’s the start of the best three months of the year.
They’re smiling because the NFL Draft is one of the greatest spectacles in sports, and the march towards Radio City Music Hall began in earnest this week.
People finally get a chance to see former college standouts prove their worth in a pro-style system. They get to see if these guys are NFL material.
Sure, it’s just a college all-star game. And one week of practices culminating in an otherwise meaningless game isn’t the be-all, end-all for these players. But for the gurus, it’s a chance to scrutinize every move. It’s the first step toward piecing together the draft puzzle.
For them, it’s fun.
But as Suh smiles, what about those who are not as fortunate to be in his position?
Take Tim Tebow for example. For four years, we watched in awe as he developed into arguably the greatest college football player of all time. Now, we watch in horror as a week’s worth of bad snaps from center and an elongated throwing motion unravel everything he’s worked for.
What about former Central Michigan quarterback Dan LeFevour? He must prove to scouts that his NCAA-record 150 touchdowns were more than a product of the system he played in.
Former Oregon running back LeGarrette Blount must show he can be a viable NFL runner, despite missing most of his senior season after an opening night haymaker.
And a few former Trojans are trying to make an impact.
Safety Taylor Mays spent four years as one of the most feared defenders in the game. Now, he has spent a week trying to ready himself for the next level. His ability to prove his worth this week, and over the next three months, is equally as important as the work he put in to reach the pinnacle of the sport — if not more so.
Stafon Johnson has a chance to prove he can still play football at the highest level, despite a weightlifting injury in September that could have ended his life.
Offensive lineman Jeff Byers has seen reps at guard and center. Tight end Anthony McCoy is proving he’s an NFL-level blocker and pass catcher.
For 100 seniors hoping to make it at the next level, this game starts a grueling stretch. Who will be smiling along with Suh and the gurus?
We’ll find out soon enough.

The USC men’s basketball team cannot seem to shake their road woes.
Tough outing · Redshirt senior forward Marcus Johnson shot just 4-for-14 from the field and scored nine points in the Trojans’ 51-45 loss. - Mike Lee | Daily Trojan 
The Trojans (12-8, 4-4) started their two-game road trip to the state of Oregon on a sour note Thursday, falling to Oregon State (9-11, 3-5) 51-45 in Corvallis, Ore. Sophomore forwards Nikola Vucevic, who had 12 points and seven rebounds, and Leonard Washington, who had 11 points and six rebounds, led the Trojans in the losing effort.
After posting 87 points — their highest point total of the season — last Saturday against Washington, the Trojans couldn’t find their offensive rhythm, turning the ball over a season-high 20 times against the Beavers. Senior guard Dwight Lewis could only muster five points on 2-12 shooting, and USC shot less than 22 percent from the 3-point line.
Keeping with the trend of the past few games, the Trojans jumped out to an early lead on an 8-1 scoring run, although the first points of the game did not come easily. USC missed four shots and gained the offensive rebound on each one before senior guard Dwight Lewis was finally able to convert a layup after a full minute of possession had passed. Relying on their defense, the Trojans were able to hold off a Beavers rally late in the half and enter the break up 27-22.
Unfortunately for USC, they could not keep their lead for long into the second half, quickly succumbing to a 21-9 run by the Beavers. Oregon State led the rest of the way, holding the Trojans to seven for 23 shooting in the half.
Oregon State center Roeland Schaftenaar was key to holding the recently reinvigorated Trojans’ offensive attack down. Schaftenaar’s eight second-half points also helped the Beavers extend their lead after the break.
It was Schaftenaar’s layup near the midway point of the second half that gave the Beavers the lead they would not give back.
A Johnson layup brought the Beaver lead back to just one point, but the Trojans would not venture closer than two points behind the Beavers for the rest of the game.
The Beavers also used guard Calvin Haynes’ 16 second-half points to distance themselves from the Trojans.
Washington’s 11 points off the bench was an encouraging sign for the Trojans during the loss, as the second-year player had not scored in the double digits since the Trojans’ Dec. 26 victory over Saint Mary’s.
Washington had been averaging less than six points per game before last night despite receiving more playing time recently.
The Trojans will face Oregon (11-9, 3-5) Saturday in Eugene to round out their weekend in the state. The game will mark the end of the first cycle of conference games this season for the two teams, as they are the only teams that have yet to play each other.
Oregon has relied heavily on the play of its guards this season, who account for four of the team’s top-five scorers. Senior guard Tajuan Porter, who averages 12.5 points per game, leads a Ducks roster that is surprisingly deep, with 10 players on the team averaging five points or more.

The Women of Troy buckled down on defense against the Oregon State Beavers Thursday night at the Galen Center, opening up their two-game home stand with a convincing 61-34 victory.
Patrolling the boards · In a game defined by defense, senior forward Aarika Hughes contributed seven big rebounds to go with her five points. The Women of Troy turned a seven-point halftime lead into a 27-point victory against Oregon State. - Tim Tran | Daily Trojan 
“I liked our defense,” said USC coach Michael Cooper. “It’s getting better as we go on, and we have a lot of players playing good basketball.”
Sophomore guards Ashley Corral and Briana Gilbreath paced the Women of Troy with 19 points and 13 points respectively.
Corral also finished with seven assists and four rebounds.
“Ashley is doing what we want her to do,” said Cooper. “But now, she is distributing the ball more and reading defenses better and we’re a lot better when she does that.”
Even with Corral’s offensive performance, defense was the key in this game.
The first half did not see much offense, as both teams struggled to score and take care of the ball.
In the first half alone, both teams combined for 16 turnovers. The Women of Troy shot just under 37 percent from the field but the Beavers did not fare much better, managing to outdo their opponents by shooting just under 30 percent.
Despite all this, the Women of Troy managed to take a seven-point lead into halftime.
The second half proved to be much better for the Women of Troy but not so for the visiting Beavers.
The Women of Troy employed a full-court press, stifling the Beavers on offense and forcing them to turn the ball over.
An 11-4 run in the beginning of the half broke the game open, and the Women of Troy never looked back as they cruised to their fifth consecutive victory.
The Women of Troy also received solid contributions from senior forward Hailey Dunham, who finished with 10 points and nine rebounds, and senior guard Heather Oliver, who came off the bench to score nine points.
The Women of Troy were also able to control the boards and keep junior guard Talisa Rhea in check, limiting her to 16 points on just 5-17 shooting.
“Defensively, we just wanted to lock down on Rhea,” said senior guard Heather Oliver. “Rebounding was also a huge thing for us [this game] and we were able to control that.”
The Women of Troy also finished with a season-high 11 blocks, with freshman forward Christina Marinacci leading the way with three blocked shots of her own.
The win gives the Women of Troy a 7-1 record in Pac-10 play heading into Saturday’s matchup with the Oregon Ducks.
“We just have to attack their press, handle the pressure and shut down their shooters,” said Oliver. “We want to do a good job against them.”
A win against the Ducks would give the Women of Troy their best start in conference play in over a decade.
Tip-off is scheduled for  2:30 p.m.

The push by USC Admissions to increase its number of visits to high schools around the world has led to a record number of freshman applications and a stronger applicant pool.
Daily Trojan | Vicki Yang
In the tough economy, many universities chose to cut their admissions travel budgets, decreasing visits to high schools. USC, meanwhile, set out to increase visits by 50 percent, aiming to attract more students from a wider variety of backgrounds. The return was about a 3 percent increase in freshman applications.
The Office of Admissions far exceeded its goal, visiting about 1,350 high schools, a 67 percent jump from last year. Though these 1,350 schools are only a few of the 30,000 high schools in the United States, Tim Brunold, associate dean and director of undergraduate admission, said the visits were integral in drawing a greater number of strong applicants to USC.
“We want to keep up the trend of delivering a freshman class that is more distinguished than the one before it,” Brunold said. “High school recruiting visits are one of the best ways to provide more high quality applicants.”
Brunold said the “volume and scope” of USC’s visits were “definitely beyond” those of other universities. USC spent $200,000 on travel for recruitment, which is  less than they had originally budgeted.
Aside from campus tours, surveys show that high school outreach visits have the greatest impact on generating applications, Brunold said. Applications from a particular school can as much as double after USC visits for the first time.
Wayne Thompson, a junior majoring in business administration, said colleges visiting his high school gave him a good picture of the university.
“It’s a tangible effect to be able to shake someone’s hand,” he said. “To converse in face just generates excitement.”
While USC visited the same number of California high schools as 2008, it increased its presence in the Southeast and Northeast, especially in highly populated states like Texas, Florida, Georgia, New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. USC drew 6.8 percent and 4.3 percent more applicants from the Southeast and Northeast, respectively.
When determining which schools to visit, USC seeks the most return on resources spent by finding schools with achievement scores that match its target and that also have a large number of students that would be interested in coming to USC.
That approach seemed to work this year, as preliminary figures show that the average SAT score of this year’s applicants was 20 points higher than last year.
Kate Durkee, an undeclared freshman, said USC mailings and a desire to move West were enough to persuade her to apply. But she said she would have liked to see USC make an effort to visit her Maryland high school. Nonetheless, she applauded this year’s increased visits.
“It makes the school more competitive,” she said. “Our reputation has already gone up, and this will create only more opportunities for all of us.”
Jordan Roberts, a freshman majoring in architecture, said about 50 students attended a USC information session at his school, six of whom went on to enroll.
“The visit did not make me want to apply anymore than I already did, but I was happy to have my financial aid questions answered directly,” he said.
A visit encouraged Stephanie Tong, a junior majoring in business administration, to apply not only because the recruiter sold the city and debunked the stigma associated with USC but also because of his attire.
“The USC officer wore a suit, and it showed that he really cared about his and the school’s persona,” she said. “It brought a level of professionalism when other schools had people come looking casual.”
Similar was the experience of Kevin Song, a junior majoring in business administration.
“It was good to hear all the benefits from one person traveling to us, instead of 50 of us going down to Los Angeles,” he said.
On the international level, USC reached 15 more schools this year. There was a 60 percent increase in applications from China and 10 percent increase from South Korea.
Although Brunold added two recruiters this year specifically for international visits, he said that number should increase as USC makes a push into India, Latin America and Canada, areas where the number of applicants did not change.
Despite the increase in applications, Brunold says the enrollment target remains 2,600 freshman, which will lower the admittance rate from 24 percent. 
As for next year, Brunold said he expects to keep being aggressive with a goal of “meeting every student that is a match for USC.”
usc news also says that usc recieved 35,753 applications for the fall 2009 class.

i’d say listen to the dt article.

this source says increase in 25 applications.
which one is right?
Don’t go to school at USC but I assume now that UC system is crambling, it is a chance for USC and other private schools to capitalize on it
enlightened, why do I smell Bruin coming off of you in waves?
You’re speaking without an ounce of personal experience and it shows. Yes, we all know that south of USC is not a pleasant place, and that Westwood is among “the real glitz of LA”. We know that UCLA has better academic faculty in general, and that UCLA focuses more on research than does USC. Never once do we deny these things.
Yet I find it hard to believe that you do not have enough class to shed these stereotypes, stop attacking the rival school, and admit that both schools are excellent. Our core curriculum may limp behind, but academically-motivated students will find that Thematic Option (the honors curriculum) will more than satisfy their intellectual itch. Besides the football team, we have many things that UCLA does not have—an undergraduate business program, an octopus (far-reaching, fast-hitting, sucking in more applicants than ever) of a film school, the Annenberg School of Communication. Sure, south of USC is gritty, but who is closer to the heart of LA, to downtown, to Pershing Square, to the Gold Line which extends to Little Tokyo and Chinatown? Hollywood gets stale when you’re not a tourist, I imagine. On top of it all, we smile and extend open palms when we meet a Bruin. Why, “enlightened”, why do you not have that sort of class? If you are a Bruin now, you don’t deserve to be one.
I think USC’s administration should be a lot more wary, “because the recruiter sold the city and debunked the stigma associated with USC but also because of his attire.” So how did the recruiter “sell” the city? It’s Los Angeles, the 2nd most populated city in the U.S. and perhaps the 6th or 7th in the world. It’s very dangerous, especially in this part. You come out when it’s dark, and you’re open game. I laugh when there is euphemism used to “sell” the glamour of USC’s geographic location. There are lots of naive students who attend here, and the DPS notifications and statistics attest to that. Stop kidding yourself USC, you know damn well that the selling this university has led to blood on your hands. I don’t want to bring up past, but not so distant, tragic events. 
Oh yeah, and the “stigma,” of what? That USC is still an overpriced party school. 
If want to attend a school with competitive academics and a much more stringent admission pool, it’s that school across town that may get it’s butt kicked in football by ‘SC, but nonetheless, they’re still a public Ivy. Oh yeah, they border Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, WESTWOOD and other affluent towns–the real glitz of L.A.–where you won’t be in danger when it’s dark.
The grand total of freshman applicants is?

After back-to-back wins last weekend, the USC women’s tennis team has pocketed some momentum for the upcoming tournament this weekend.
USC welcomes Auburn, LSU and San Diego to Los Angeles as they host the qualifying rounds for the Intercollegiate Tennis Association National Indoor Championships.
Daily Trojan | Amaresh Sunduran Kuppuswamy
No. 35 Auburn (1-1) and No. 28 LSU (2-0) play first today at 10 a.m., followed by a 2 p.m. matchup between No. 9 USC (2-0) and No. 60 San Diego (1-0). The losing teams play in the consolation match at 2:30 p.m. Saturday, while the winning teams will face each other afterward at 5:30 p.m.
The winner of the later match will go on to play in the ITA National Team Indoor Championships beginning Feb. 12 in Madison, Wis.
The USC women hold a top-10 national ranking and are undefeated after a 6-1 opening win over Long Beach State and another 6-1 victory over UC Irvine to kick off the 2010 season. Four USC women are nationally ranked in singles along with one ranked doubles pair.
With the confidence from their opening matches, the Women of Troy are excited for some ITA action, and this is also their only scheduled game against any East Coast schools.
“We know they’re good,” junior Maria Sanchez said. “We just have to be ready.”

The dynamic of The Row will be different next fall, as several houses are in the process of planning moves, signing leases or finding alternative housing options.
Trading spaces · Zeta Beta Tau will leave its current location and move into the house currently occupied by Pi Kappa Alpha. Pi Kappa Phi will move into ZBT’s current house, and Pike is looking for a house.  - Ian Elston | Daily Trojan 
Come fall, Zeta Beta Tau fraternity will take over the house currently occupied by Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity; Pi Kappa Phi fraternity will move back into the house it owns, though it is currently being used by ZBT; and Pike has yet to decide where it will move.
Earlier this month, the landlord of the current Pike house decided not to renew the fraternity’s lease. Pike has occupied the house, which is owned by Phi Sigma Kappa, since fall 2005.
According to Pike President Eric Geibel, the fraternity has been looking for alternative housing arrangements for the past two years.
“We’re very dissatisfied with our landlord, and we feel he has not met his obligation to us as tenants in providing a valuable house,” Geibel said. “It hasn’t adequately met our needs, and we’ve had a housing committee for the last two years trying to find new options for us that would be better.”
The fraternity felt it was paying too much for the house and is evaluating other options, Geibel said. Though the location of its new home has yet to be determined, Geibel said he views this as a good opportunity for Pike.
“I’m personally excited to be moving out of here,” Geibel said. “It’s just been a long time coming, and the members of our house deserve something much better.”
When Pike moves out at the end of the spring semester, ZBT will take over its lease.
ZBT President Ivan Whittey said he had no say in the decision to leave the current house and move into the Pike house.
“No current active members of either of the houses were part of negotiations,” Whittey said.
The current ZBT house will be occupied by PiKapp come fall. PiKapp owns the house and has been leasing it for the past few years while the fraternity worked to get back on its feet.
PiKapp recolonized in 2009 and is currently not housed. Since recolonizing, PiKapp’s membership has increased to about 65 members and it is now prepared to move back into the home.
According to PiKapp President Alex Fadil, ZBT was well aware that PiKapp was moving back to campus and reclaiming its house. He added that the fraternity has been anxiously awaiting its return to The Row.
“We’re definitely very excited to move back to The Row,” Fadil said.
Meanwhile, Pike continues to search for a new house, though Geibel said the fraternity has a few options.
“Currently, we have three or four very viable options for next year that will be much better than our current house,” said Geibel. “We’re looking for something that is better quality, more affordable and can fit more people.”
Pike is also considering building a completely new house, Geibel said.
“We haven’t finalized it,” he said. “There’s a lot of opportunities out there, one of which would be constructing a brand new house, which is an extremely viable option. We do have a lot of funding.”

Students without cars could soon find themselves with even fewer options for getting around Los Angeles.
Passenger on · A student boards the DASH at the intersection of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street. DASH prices are set to increase soon, and LADOT is also considering cutting some bus routes. - Vicki Yang | Daily Trojan 
Because of massive budget deficits, Los Angeles’ major public transit systems — the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation — are considering hiking fares and cutting bus lines.
Both MTA, which runs the regular bus routes, and LADOT, whose services include the DASH and the Commuter Express, are researching ridership levels around the city as they consider which lines to shut down.
“It’s in the early stages,” said MTA spokesman Rick Jager. “It’s irresponsible to say which lines will be cut. [At the moment] we have no plans on how to deal with the deficit.”
Jager noted that the number of riders tends to be high in the USC area, but he could not say for sure if the routes near USC would be safe.
MTA has seen a significant drop in ridership recently, causing a large budget deficit that will reach $250 million by the end of the 2011 fiscal year.
Last year, the MTA board approved a 25-cent fare increase, which was set to take effect in July. The increase was postponed by the passage of Measure R, which increased sales tax in Los Angeles County by a half-cent to help finance transportation projects. Fares are now expected to rise this July, jumping from $1.25 to $1.50 per ride, with daily pass fares rising from $5 to $6.
LADOT is facing similar deficits and will also hike up bus fares and cut some less-popular bus lines.
“The bottom line is that we haven’t raised the rates from a quarter since the line started in the ’80s,” said Bruce Gillman, LADOT spokesman. “The money that underwrites our lines have been cut — there’s been a drop in Prop C funds. No line in our transit system operates at a profit. By raising the fare, we hope to keep our system running.”
LADOT bus fares will increase from 25 cents to 50 cents per ride, though it has not yet decided when this increase will happen. It plans on cutting some lines with low numbers of riders, though at the moment it is unclear which lines will go. In the meantime, six different public hearings will be held across Los Angeles in the coming months as an opportunity for riders to voice their comments and concerns about the proposed changes and reductions.
Some feel, however, that these public hearings might not have a bearing on the final transit decisions.
“It could or could not have an effect on their final decision,” said Barbara Lott-Holland, co-chair of the Bus Riders Union. “If the public comes out overwhelmingly and says these budget cuts are unjust and how they should redistribute their funds, then it’s possible that public opinion will outweigh [its decisions]. Or, LADOT could have already made up their minds.”
MTA has not announced any public hearings, but law mandates that a hearing be held before any major changes are enacted.
Despite the increases in bus fare, students say riding the bus will still be the best option for getting around.
“We have Zipcars, but the bus is still cheaper,” said Yogesh Shrivastava, a graduate student studying computer science. “If you have to go somewhere near, the bus is the only option.”
Shilpi Sanchetee, a graduate student studying computer science, agreed.
“The frequency [of the buses] is not good,” Sanchetee said, “But sometimes you don’t have another option.”
Lott-Holland encouraged everyone to go to the LADOT public hearings and voice their concerns.
“We are urging the public in large to support the Bus Union Clean Air and Economic Justice Plan,” Lott-Holland said. “It can be used to expand the bus system countywide while staying within the city’s budget and without including fair increases and line cuts.”
One of the public hearings will be held at the South Los Angeles Community Center in the USC area on Feb. 17.
“I would definitely go,” said Shrivastava, “that will affect a lot of people. We should always contribute to things that make a difference.”
It also shouidl be noted the BRU Clean Air and Economic Justice Plan that Lott-Holland promotes is a DOA collection of ideas they have been promoting for a decade that are mostly laughable soundbites that lack any credibility or value. They may have spent more time coming up with the impressive sounding name for it than the contents, that mostly cause derision for the clueless way that they are still touting it. Proof they make noise but have little substance.
BTW, within a year USC will be linked to the growing light rail network when Expo Phase 1 opens, so the students are actually on the cusp of having a great improvement to their transit access.
Note: LADOT has no plans on reducing or cutting service on the F Dash. The only downtonw DASH routes affected are DD, C, Central City East, and some other neighborhood routes. There is limited effect on USC with any proposed service cuts. This article should clear that up and not make it seem USC students are in trouble…

During the preseason, USC head basketball coach Kevin O’Neill was quite critical of the Trojans’ 2009 non-conference schedule for being too soft and not featuring enough matchups against top-25 teams. Fortunately for O’Neill, that won’t be an issue next season.
According to Scott Wolf of the Los Angeles Daily News, USC has already reached tentative agreements to play games against Kansas and Marquette next season in addition to their previously scheduled contests with three of this year’s opponents, Nebraska, Tennessee and Texas.
If that isn’t enough, the Trojans will also participate in the Big 12-Pac-10 challenge, where they will face an undetermined opponent. This year, USC struggled in the event, losing to Nebraska by three points at home and to Texas on the road by a score of 69-50.
But quality opponents are not the only reason why next season’s slate will be all the more challenging. The Trojans — who have impressed sports fan nationwide this season with their 12-7 record — will be faced with the challenge of replacing senior guards and key starters Mike Gerrity, Marcus Johnson and Dwight Lewis.
In turn, the team will feature an entirely new backcourt. Incoming freshmen Maurice Jones of Arthur Hill High School in Saginaw, Mich. and Bryce Jones of Taft High School in Woodland Hills, Calif. will be expected to start in place of the graduating Gerrity and Lewis. Fordham transfer Jio Fontan may eventually start at point guard, but he won’t be eligible to play until after the first semester in mid-December.
With a tougher slate combined with an unproven backcourt, the Trojans will be hard-pressed to experience the same success they enjoyed in 2009.

Mel Gibson, a man once very near the top of the Hollywood hierarchy, is going to have a very difficult time gaining back the respect and acknowledgement of his peers and audiences, after all he has been through. But at least he is attempting to do so by going back to the basics that made him a household name.
The 54-year-old actor is once again embracing his mad-as-hell on-screen persona that initially made him famous by appearing in Edge of Darkness, his first leading role in eight years, opening today.
Gibson portrays a Boston police detective who, after his daughter is murdered, goes on a vicious and bloody quest for revenge that echoes the attitude of a few of his past performances.
Before Gibson ever made The Passion of the Christ or spewed offensive remarks toward Jews, he was simply known as Mad Max.
In 1979, the unknown Australian-American actor got his first big break by appearing in Mad Max as an emotionally driven madman, a role that fully expressed his raw talent.
In the movie, Gibson played a police officer in the Australian outback during a time when the principle ideas of law and order are just beginning to collapse and a grim, apocalyptic wasteland beginning to develop.  After Max’s family is brutally attacked by a biker gang, he loses his sense of morality and enacts his violent rage on the gang while at the same time becoming part of an engulfing wasteland.
The film was so successful in Australia and the United States that Gibson reprised the role in Mad Max 2, better known as The Road Warrior. This time, society has fully collapsed into desolation, and the sequel showcases Max as fully dissociated with humanity and propelled by violence.
Both of these films made Gibson a success, but it was his role in 1987’s Lethal Weapon and its first sequel, that made him a star. His portrayal of Martin Riggs, a L.A. detective with a death wish, illustrated the manic yet sensational character development that, as an actor, Gibson has long sought to perfect.
These films flawlessly feature Gibson’s power as an actor because they represent the general acceptance of amorality, which is what he personifies best on screen. This is where Gibson has always excelled, but it is his attempt to be seen as a regular guy that Hollywood and most of the world seems to be concerned with, an effort that will make his comeback difficult.
The real question that develops as a result is whether or not an actor should be judged by his films or by the events, both good and bad, that occur within his private life.
Gibson’s initial fame as an actor is being overshadowed by his presence as a celebrity, an area in which topics such as religious beliefs, legal troubles and problems with alcohol gain the most attention and are often deemed most important.
It is true that Gibson has expressed his religious beliefs quite feverishly with The Passion of the Christ — which certainly provoked debate regarding the presence of religion within the medium of film and how it is represented — but should his opinions overshadow his acting abilities?
Mel Gibson has made mistakes and behaved inappropriately but not as an actor; after all, he should be recognized by audiences as an actor, not a celebrity.
Gibson has paid for these mistakes and will continue to do so. The television show South Park has had a lot of fun with him, and Gibson’s alcoholism was the butt of the best joke at the Golden Globe awards, which he appropriately played along with.
But as people head out to see Gibson’s comeback film — though some refuse to acknowledge it as such — at least he is returning to form and finally reviving that mad-as-hell persona that he knows works so well.
In his new film, Gibson’s character is infuriated by rage that is translated into violent action, blatantly ignoring all sense of morality in order to find his daughter’s killer. By doing so, Gibson is reminding his audience that he can still portray the intensity he is known for — a very wise move on his part to return to a character that audiences actually want to see him embody.
With Edge of Darkness, Gibson seems to finally be expressing his talents as an actor, not as a celebrity. It seems as though Hollywood might be ready to have the old Mel Gibson back.

The first annual eWorld Music Awards took place this Wednesday at L.A. Live’s Conga Room. The new awards show, which will be held annually the week leading up to the Grammy Awards, honors cutting-edge music artists that are emerging on the Internet.
eWorld Media, the organizers of the awards show, focuses on distributing technologies such as its free Internet application Boomerang Media Station, which streams music, movies and webcasts.
The eWorld Music Awards was executive produced by Steven Marcus Aurelius, a multiplatinum, multi-Grammy award-winning songwriter and producer; John Hamilton, a five-time producer of the Golden Globes; and Chris Donovan, a seven-time director of the Independent Spirit Awards.
The red carpet was flooded with reporters from small online newspapers as well as large entertainment networks like E! in a rare merging of small and large media outlets. Attendees included numerous important players within the entertainment industry, including rising artists, music producers, agents and publicists. The event was also open to the general public for ticket prices of only $30.
The Conga Room was a spectacular venue choice. With a balcony, dining room, multiple bars and impressive sound and lighting system, it provided the perfect venue for an awards show such as this.
But despite the award’s potential and all the excitement leading up to its premiere, the eWorld Music Awards show ended up being a bit of a disappointment. The much-touted host — MTV V.J. Susie Castillo — was not in attendance, an absence left unexplained.
As a result, the entire show ran rather haphazardly and lacked structure. In addition, the show fell victim to a number of technical difficulties — ironic, considering eWorld’s claim to technical innovation.
After a long delay in its start time, the awards show kicked off with a solid performance by Jason Derulo, the R&B/pop performer known best for his ubiquitous and catchy song “Whatcha Say.”
He commanded the stage with smooth dance moves and light-up finger gloves, both of which echoed the late Michael Jackson. Derulo popped, locked and moonwalked gracefully while he sang his noteworthy single. His vocals were surprisingly strong, which suggests the possibility of a career without the aid of autotune that is so prevalent in his hit song.
After his performance, Derulo accepted the Future Icon Award, and the show went downhill from there.
The stage went dark and a D.J. began playing music, signaling an unannounced intermission. The break lasted for over half an hour, as the audience grew restless and became confused.
Finally, another musical performer walked onstage, without introduction. It was the hip-hop/R&B duo Rock City who performed a beautiful a cappella tribute to its home in the Virgin Islands, followed by an energetic, upbeat song “Wave,” which showcased its quirky personality and strong stage presence.
The next performance was by Rej3ctz, who also won the Creators of the Jerk Movement Award. The group poorly lip-synced a hip-hop/electronic song but had plenty of enthusiastic dance moves to compensate for its inability to actually sing.
Rej3ctz were followed by the recipients of the Award for New Movement, SA-RA, a diverse band featuring a bongo drum player and a saxophonist. Its highly anticipated performance started out shaky, as the band was out of sync. The group finally hit its stride with the song “Hollywood,” but it seems SA-RA may need more experience performing live before it  can break into the larger music scene.
The highlight of the night was an appearance by legendary Russ Regan, who received the Lifetime Achievement Award. The record executive was responsible for discovering talents like Elton John and the Beach Boys. He also has won four Academy Awards and is one of two music executives who have sold a billion records.
The many interludes between winner announcements and performances made the event feel more like an extended concert party than an awards show.
Thankfully, the D.J. provided enough good music for attendees to get out and dance on the floor beneath the stage during the long lulls.
The eWorld Music Awards might aspire to be the next industry awards show, but it will have to get its act together beforehand. Hopefully it can because the many artists that are pushing their way to fame through the Internet deserve the chance to be recognized for their diverse talents in their own unique awards event.

Nicholas Jerry Jonas is a man in-between. At 17, Nick Jonas, the youngest member of the platinum-selling Jonas Brothers outfit, is in the midst of orchestrating one of the most delicate rebranding efforts ever undertaken by a performing artist. The maneuver requires an admittedly tricky transition between groups, genres, images and — most dangerously — fan bases. While Jonas has publicly and repeatedly assured legions of disconcertingly devout fans that his new project — grandly titled Nick Jonas & The Administration, a reference to the ingénue’s oft-mentioned presidential aspirations — is in no way a harbinger of a future Jonas Brothers disbandment. He seems fully invested in the new musical enterprise.
Louis Lucero II | Daily Trojan
Nick Jonas & The Administration’s four-night engagement at the Wiltern ends tonight, concluding a brief run in Southern California. The performances are part of a tour organized in support of the group’s upcoming release.
The two greatest resistances to Jonas’ efforts to recast himself as a serious musician are the Jonas Brothers’ existing fan base — primarily comprising rabidly enamored tweens — and common sense. Foolish though it may seem to alter an image and business model that has been proven successful a million times over, Jonas was insistent on pursuing a more mature sound through his new project. In many ways, Tuesday night’s show at the Wiltern characterized what might prove to be an uphill reinvention effort.
Jonas’ set consisted primarily of songs from the group’s as yet unreleased debut album, Who I Am.
Shaky audience recognition of original material from Nick Jonas & The Administration — a phenomenon probably not unique to the group’s Los Angeles appearances — made for an unusual atmosphere at the Wiltern: The youngest of the performing Jonas siblings (don’t forget Frankie, “the bonus Jonas”) is probably unaccustomed to anything less than 100 percent crowd participation by way of sing-along. The impeccably prompt set was bookended by the two most recognizable songs from the upcoming record, opening with “Rose Garden” and closing with the title track “Who I Am” in the encore.
Jonas (probably wisely) peppered the set with favorite numbers from the Jonas Brothers’ repertoire, including “Black Keys,” “Tonight,” “A Little Bit Longer” (complete with compulsory audience interaction in which Jonas describes his diagnosis with type one diabetes in 2005), and a decelerated acoustic interpretation of “Inseparable” from the Jonas Brothers’ eponymous first album with Hollywood Records. Much to the delight of the Disney fans in attendance (read “the audience”), Jonas also confirmed that production plans had been announced for a sequel to 2008’s wildly popular Camp Rock.
All titillating revelations aside, the seamless medley Jonas performed unaccompanied midway through the set was one of the highlights of the evening. The songs sampled ran the gamut from Owl Ciy’s “Fireflies” to “Use Somebody” by Kings of Leon; perplexingly, Nick also elected to incorporate Grammy-nominated “You Belong With Me,” the hit song by older brother Joe’s ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift.
For all his mature posturings, Jonas is essentially the same person as he was in all previous tours with the Jonas Brothers. He has always been the most grounded of the group, the trio’s de facto leader in spite of his age. Nick has also always been the most musically talented of the group: His acting credits include Broadway productions of Les Miserables and Beauty and the Beast, and he also wrote most of the material on the Jonas Brothers’ first four albums. Despite Nick’s onstage concessions that he wasn’t necessarily comfortable in the role of front man — Joe has fronted the Jonas Brothers for most of the group’s existence — it’s clear that he relishes the opportunity to exercise even greater control over his group’s artistic vision.

The revolution will be digitized.
A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation shows that children now spend more than 53 hours a week on the computer, watching T.V. and playing video games. Despite alarmed reactions from experts, this excessive exposure to media can actually be beneficial.
Daily Trojan | Hye You
A simple online search with the keywords “computer time kids” yields thousands of results of tips and guides for parents on how to limit their children’s computer and video game activity. This concern, although legitimate, is a little bit of an overreaction. Spending too much time playing video games or watching T.V. might lead to health problems from a lack of exercise, but does not necessarily cause degraded mental capacity or personal relationships.
Computers, even when used by children for games and social networking, offer critical-thinking challenges to young children while teaching them basic interactive and organizational skills. The simple act of learning how to manage your own farm in FarmVille can give a child valuable logic and management skills.
A skill often overlooked by older generations, computer literacy is extremely valuable both in adolescence and adulthood. Hiring employees who have excellent computer skills has become an industry standard in nearly every profession.
More important than basic computer skills is the art of multitasking. When children listen to music on their computers while simultaneously playing a video game and watching sports highlights, parents often worry their children are being overloaded with information. This “overload,” however, trains a young mind to process multiple tasks at one time. Instead of playing simple games and running around in the mud like children of the past, the youth of today exercise their minds in a massive, limitless and always-changing playground: the Internet.
The Internet acts not only as an analytical tool but also as an ultra-efficient and inexpensive disseminator of information. While spending hours browsing the web,
adolescents can explore and research every fantastical whim. Even at the university level, many students would rather give up on something entirely than put in the effort to look it up in an encyclopedia. However, a quick Wikipedia or YouTube search is all it takes to quickly quench curiosity. If the youth are being drowned in a digital sea of technology and information, chances are they know much more about the world than the children of yesteryear.
And though some would also argue excessive Internet usage decreases the quality of communication and personal relationships, the truth is children would communicate even less if the digital medium was removed.
“I used to talk to my grandmother on the phone about once every couple months, but ever since she got a laptop she e-mails me every week to find out how I’m doing,” said, Justin Leeka, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences.
Although a handwritten letter or a personal meeting would be very desirable, it is anything but practical. Computers allow young children to talk to their friends and family in a very efficient way; this overall increase in communication has helped improve existing relationships as well as foster new ones.
Being exposed to a variety of digital information and media throughout the day can foster critical thinking, useful computer skills and valuable insight into the outside world. The only reason parents say they “always used to play outside as a kid” is that they never had any fascinating technology to play inside with.

A cloud of debate hangs high in the Tibetan Plateau of the Himalayas. On one side, the Tibetans and their supporters have, for the past 50 years, fought for independence and genuine autonomy. Sympathy lies with the exiled Tibetan leader, the Dalai Lama. Further, countless human rights violations against the Tibetans are claimed to have occurred at the hands of the Chinese government. On the other side, Beijing has retained an iron grip on the political and cultural aspects of the region it claims as Southern China. 
The controversial saga between China and Tibet was revisited Tuesday, thawing the silence since the last talks ended in November 2008. Chinese President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao and Vice President Xi Jinping attended the meeting with the Dalai Lama’s envoys at the other end of the table. Some scholars believe this surprising ninth round of talks may indicate that China is offering an olive branch of sorts to its neighbor.
The Chinese government-backed Xinhua News Agency reported that diplomats at the meeting discussed improving the living standards of the Tibetan people to national levels by 2020. Indeed, the Chinese government has taken strides to develop Tibet economically by providing incentives for Han Chinese to migrate there, creating jobs and infrastructure in the process.
But while increased standards of living are nice, the people of Tibet are probably more concerned with their political status. The Dalai Lama’s government-in-exile is bent on achieving genuine autonomy and holding the religion, culture and well-being of his people as the top priority.
Early in the talks, the Chinese government refused to remove its military presence in the densely populated regions of Tibet — judging from this result, progress may be harder to achieve than expected. Perhaps this round of talks is just another demonstration by China to push its consistent hard-line approach on Tibet.
Admittedly, I am certainly not in the Chinese camp on this issue. After fatefully discovering the tenuous China-Tibet issue during my junior year of high school, I was convinced that the Chinese government was purposefully exploiting and eliminating the rich Tibetan culture. Accounts by imprisoned nuns and dissidents only inflamed my reaction. Reading up on the International Campaign for Tibet, it seemed obvious at the time that China was, simply, the bad guy.
Andrew Laskowski | Daily Trojan
Today, I can’t say with certainty that I’ve completely abandoned that thought. I’d like to think that some of my idealistic naïveté has ebbed and China’s reasons for claiming Tibet are not completely unfounded. After all, it’s difficult to give up such valuables as mineral resources and an opportunity to display its clout and potential to develop Tibet as a Chinese cosmopolitan region. Additionally, the issue probably contains more complexities than are apparent. Nonetheless, China’s global reputation is hazy, and this round of stagnant talks doesn’t do much to change that opinion.
Needless to say, China is a great country with an even greater potential to rival the United States. The National Bureau of Statistics of China is reporting very optimistic statistics for its economy — gross domestic product growth of about 9 percent and a stable unemployment rate less than 5 percent. The rise of the Chinese dragon, as they call it, is happening as we speak. Yet, its rise may not be met with much sustained success if its reputation isn’t detoxified.
From the most recent reports of the eviction of thousands of Chinese residents for building development, to the alleged hacking attacks on Google, China’s international character is not getting a good rap nowadays. Don’t forget its controversial tussle with the Uighurs in 2009, which resulted in 200 deaths and a messy affair for Beijing to clean up.
If China wants to play the game and compete with the rest of the world, perhaps it ought to play by the rules. For China, arriving at stalemate after stalemate with the Dalai Lama only creates a more tense relationship and doesn’t achieve much else. The Danish Foreign minister Per Stig Møller called on both parties to ultimately allow for the Tibetans to “attain genuine self-rule, with cultural and religious freedom and respect for human rights within the framework of the Chinese constitution.”
The United Kingdom’s junior Foreign Office Minister Ivan Lewis added, “Peaceful dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama’s representatives is the only way to bring about a lasting and peaceful solution to the problems in Tibet.”
Though open-mindedness can’t hurt the relationship, it certainly isn’t enough. China has failed not only to hold peaceful dialogues, it has also—more importantly — manifested its anti-Dalai Lama and anti-autonomy notions through its actions. It is time China matches the thrust of its global and political influence with behavior that is supported by a clear conscience, and this round of talks is the perfect opportunity to do so.

I am wondering, have the author ever been to China?
There are more than one sides of this issue. While it’s true that China’s (re)conquest of Tibet in 1957 was motivated by the region’s natural resources and strategic location, it’s also true that Tibet was a feudal state where the vast majority were slaves and serfs owned by elites like the Dalai Lama and his handlers. China freed the slaves, built schools and hospitals, cured polio and smallpox, and is slowly but surely improving economic opportunities for native Tibetans. China will never give up the territory, and the Dalai Lama will never get his slaves back, so if that’s how you define “progress” you’re going to be disappointed. 
As a major economic partner of China, our role should be to encourage China to embrace reforms that increase individual freedom and protect human rights *generally* (throughout China). That’s a realistic kind of “progress” that can improve life for all of China’s citizens, including the Tibetan people.

The Rookie Challenge has long been a place to see the up-and-coming stars of the NBA shine, but very rarely has the Sophomore vs. Rookie spectacle featured any former Trojans.
This year, however, three different ex-USC basketball players will be featured in the Challenge, with one even contributing to the halftime entertainment.
The annual event – held during the NBA’s All-Star Weekend – pits first-year NBA rookies against second-year sophomores. This year, the game will feature one former Trojan on both teams.
Last year’s NBA Rookie of the Year runner-up, Memphis Grizzlies point guard O.J. Mayo, is among the more obvious selections for the sophomore squad, which also features other successful young players like the Bulls’ Derrick Rose, the Timberwolves’ Kevin Love and the Nets’ Brook Lopez.
Suiting up for the rookies is Bulls’ forward and former Trojan Taj Gibson, who was picked 26th overall in last year’s draft and has been a pleasant surprise for the Chicago team, where he has made his way onto the starting roster for the Bulls for a large portion of the season.
During halftime of the usually competitive game between the two young squads a new event will premiere, and will feature the third former Trojan to be featured during the day.
DeMar DeRozan will compete in the new “Dunk-In” against the Clippers’ Eric Gordon. The Toronto Raptor rookie starter DeRozan was not selected to play on the rookie team, but if he beats Gordon during halftime, he will receive a berth in the actual Dunk Contest to be held on February 13th.
DeRozan would face the Knicks’ Nate Robinson, the Bobcat’s Gerald Wallace and the Lakers’ Shannon Brown if he makes the glitzy Dunk Contest.

The Department of Justice’s Monday ruling on the legality of the Live Nation–Ticketmaster merger will change the face of American concert-going in much the same way that a vat of acid changed the face of Harvey Dent (you probably know him as Two Face, Batman’s most ungodly-visaged nemesis).
Live Nation — the ubiquitous concert promoter behind most of the high-profile shows being put on any given night — has been given the go-ahead from the Department of Justice to combine operations with Ticketmaster, the country’s preeminent ticket vendor. With this new arrangement, the freshly joined giants will have consolidated nearly all aspects of the live entertainment industry: everything from booking to publicity to ticket sales will now pass through the hands of newly formed Live Nation Entertainment.
One important aspect of the merger is the venue ownership that accompanies the deal. Many popular performance spots had exclusive deals with Live Nation — locally, the Wiltern, Hollywood Palladium, Avalon, Gibson Amphitheatre and Sunset Strip House of Blues all had exclusive contracts as Live Nation venues. When the merger is complete, any performer or group wishing to play one of the venues will have no way around working with the new Live Nation Entertainment giant.
In response to reasonable concerns that the merger will edge out competition and result in an unfair monopoly of the live entertainment industry, the Department of Justice is requiring that Ticketmaster make its ticket selling technology available to AEG, the management company which owns the Staples Center. AEG, which is in basically the same business as Live Nation was previously (i.e., promotions and management), will now have access to technologies that will allegedly enable it to compete with the newly formed Live Nation Entertainment conglomerate.
It strikes me as absurd that the Department of Justice qualified its approval of the juncture on the condition that Live Nation Entertainment divulge its ticket-selling technologies to AEG, thereby “creating its own competition.” Beyond being completely symbolic, the qualification imposed by the Department of Justice reflects a ridiculous level of intervention on the part of the federal government. Staking the legality of business moves on the compliance of the involved companies with arbitrary requirements more nearly resembles shoddy parenting than sound interpretation of the law.
Similar brouhaha surrounded the XM and Sirius satellite radio juncture a few years back. Then as now, the concern stemmed from speculation that combining the two broadcasting behemoths would create an unfair monopoly in the satellite radio market. The merger — which eventually resulted in SIRIUS XM Radio — was announced in Feb. 2007 and only approved in Mar. 2008, bringing the entire judicial approval process to more than one year.
Both of these cases resulted in market-dominating forces that are practically without match. The implications of this merger for live entertainment both in Los Angeles and across the country are open to debate, but what is not is the result of the Department of Justice’s decisions. Swap out those houses for a hotel: what we’ve got here is clearly a monopoly.
