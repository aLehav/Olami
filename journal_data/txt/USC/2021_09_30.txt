Free Britney, bitch.
With her Sept. 29 hearing underway, multiple documentaries have been released regarding Britney Spears and her 13 year-long conservatorship. These documentaries shed light on the situation, but more importantly, they have made the conservatorship and its issues public knowledge. Spears shocked the world on June 23 when she openly addressed the conservatorship for the first time during her testimony.
However, Spears has been dropping hints post-2007 alluding to her conservatorship, and eerily enough, has foreshadowed her situation in a few of her pre-2007 songs. Maybe next time we bop to these bangers, we can stop to think of what Spears was going through when she released these songs:
Dark Lyrics:
Lucky – Oops!…I Did It Again (2000)
Being the second single of her second album, “Lucky” tells the story of a fictional character and her struggle with Hollywood fame. Nowadays, fans are spooked by how much the song’s lyrics, despite being released 21 years ago, eerily reflect Spears’ current situation. In the song’s refrain, Spears sings that “they say / She’s so lucky, she’s a star / But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart.” When Spears made her public court appearance on June 23, in her testimony she said, “I thought people would make fun of me … and say, “She’s lying, she’s got everything, she’s Britney Spears.” Later in her testimony, she says “I’m not happy. I can’t sleep … I cry every day.” In the second verse of the song, Spears sings that “the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning” but asks “what happens when it stops?” 
Spears confirmed in her testimony that the conservatorship has been effective for 13 years, and during that period of time, she released four studio albums and went on their respective tours. After her ninth studio album “Glory,” Spears went dark in the music industry and never spoke about her conservatorship in public until recently.
Overprotected – Britney (2001)
Only one year later, Spears came out with “Overprotected” for a third studio album that marked the beginning of her settling into her more mature image, contrary to her first two albums. In the context of 2001, “Overprotected” can be seen as Spears’ response to the criticism she received for assuming such a provocative image. However, the song’s lyrics also foreshadow Spears’ struggle with her conservatorship. 
She sings “I’ll tell ‘em what I like, what I want, and what I don’t / But every time I do, I stand corrected.” In “Britney: For the Record,” a documentary released in 2008 (the first year the conservatorship was put into effect), Spears says, “The way I feel, they hear me, but they’re really not listening. ”
In “Controlling Britney Spears,” one of the most recent documentaries released addressing the Free Britney movement, it is revealed that many of Spears’ interactions and conversations with other people were monitored and since the conservatorship, she has not been allowed to have a phone that did not have parental controls.
If U Seek Amy – Circus (2009)
This single for Spears’ heavily anticipated sixth studio album, which marked her supposed comeback following the tumultuousness of her 2007 “Blackout” era, shocked listeners then and shocks them now for different reasons. In 2009, the song was a clever way to sneak the f-word into the radio, which gives Amy’s seemingly innocent story a dirtier undertone. Spears sings “all of the boys and all of the girls are begging to if you seek Amy.” Although this catchy line can be taken as Spears being sought after by everyone, she is also saying that everyone is out to get her and screw her over, which would align with her feelings of powerlessness within the conservatorship that would have already been in effect for a year by the time “Circus” was released.
Work Bitch – Britney Jean (2013)
When this ultimate workout anthem was released, fans made light of the fact that Spears became their main motivation to carry out their everyday goals. Although an essentially harmless bop, the song has a much darker lens with the knowledge that 2011-2013 was one of Spears’ most difficult periods in the context of the conservatorship. In the song, she lists specific items that the listener would supposedly want as a result of being rich and famous such as “a Lamborghini” and ends each line with “You better work, b**ch.” One of the most haunting lines in this song is when she sings “You wanna live fancy?” In “Controlling Britney Spears,” one of Spears’ former assistants reveals that because Spears no longer had autonomy over her finances, she was restricted from buying even the smallest things such as a pair of Skechers that she thought were cute. More recently, Spears posted on her Instagram that the iPad she ordered had finally arrived and emphasized that she never owned one prior to that day. 
Dark Music Videos:
Break the Ice – Circus (2009)
The music video that was released with this song could be considered one of Spears’ most interesting concepts to date. In order to further promote it, the concept of the music video was turned into a fan contest, and the concept that won depicted Spears as a superhero. In the video, we see Spears break into a laboratory where the bad guys are culturing clones of Spears’ character. Looking deeper, however, these clones of Spears can be seen as the typical sexy “Britney Spears” brand that she was known for most of her career that the conservatorship forced on the public to let them think there was nothing wrong, neglecting Spears’ true well-being under the surface of her happy and content persona.
Hold It Against Me – Femme Fatale (2011)
The elaborate and complex concept for the music video for the “Femme Fatale” single can be said to have had more impact on Spears’ fanbase than the actual song itself. With absolutely no correlation to the lyrics, the music video triggered the rise of conspiracy theories regarding Spears’ situation, some as extreme as her involvement with the Illuminati and others as simple as alluding to the possibility that she is trying to send us a message about her situation. Spears’ preference for camera symbolism in her music videos has been present since the paparazzi’s obsession with her in 2007. However, post-2007, the camera has taken on a different meaning and in the video, the insane amount of cameras focused on Spears could be a hint to the incessant monitoring of Spears during her conservatorship.
I Wanna Go – Femme Fatale (2011)
The fact that the music video jabbing at the conservatorship for this single was released within the “Femme Fatale” era same as the previous is very telling given that 2011 was one of Spears’ most difficult years in terms of the conservatorship. The video follows Spears wreaking havoc as a form of rebellion (while fighting off evil humanoids). 
The concept aligns with the song’s surficially sexual lyrics of “taking out my freak tonight” and showing “all the dirt I got running through my mind.” At the end of the video, Spears is led safely off-stage by her supposed manager until he breaks the fourth wall and reveals that he too is an evil humanoid. In retrospect, the turn isn’t surprising after Spears mentioned in her most recent testimony that her management played a complacent role in the conservatorship and often gave her ultimatums if she did not comply with their wishes.
Make Me… – Glory (2016)
Finally, Spears’ most recent single for her ninth studio album, was revealed to have had two versions of the music video, one released and one unreleased. The version that was released featured Spears auditioning various men who wanted to be in her music video, a rather simple concept. However, the unreleased version, which was leaked on YouTube, contains images that were obvious hints at her conservatorship. 
Spears, in the music video, throws a TV that was displaying the events of the music video into the pool, which ends up electrocuting whoever was swimming at the time it happened. The camera then cuts to Spears in a red catsuit in a cage in the pool. Cage imagery is not unfamiliar to Spears. During her “Piece of Me” tour, Spears was often seen dancing in a cage, representative of the restraint that colored her entire life.

As the coronavirus pandemic raged throughout the United States in August, the Supreme Court made the decision to reverse the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s eviction moratorium, raising concerns about the livelihood of six million renters. 
With crucial renter protections gone, eviction cases are paralyzing the courts and families are struggling to find affordable housing. Some states offered an extension on the moratorium, such as California, but the state’s protection will expire Sept. 30.
Annenberg School of Communication’s Center for Health Journalism hosted a webinar Wednesday to discuss the implications of the moratorium’s end, as well as other pandemic aid programs. The panelists focused on the effects the end of these programs will have on low-income communities, discussing which tenants are most at risk, why some tenants have faced challenges to access aid and how journalists can use the power of storytelling to convey the tenants’ struggles. 
Michelle Levander, the founding director of the Center for Health Journalism, moderated the webinar and introduced the panelists — Peter Hepburn, assistant professor of global urban studies and urban systems at Rutgers University, Kriston Capps, staff writer for Bloomberg CityLab in Washington, D.C. and Tina Rosales, an advocate on the housing team of the Western Center on Law and Poverty. 
Hepburn started the webinar by comparing pre-pandemic eviction rates to those during the pandemic. The Eviction Lab calculated that in 2016, a year with a 5% unemployment rate, 3.7 million eviction complaints were filed across the country.
The pandemic exacerbated the affordable housing crisis and increased the risk of eviction for renters, particularly low-income renters, according to Hepburn. At the start of the pandemic, approximately 50 million people lived in a renter household that endured coronavirus-related job or income loss, 40% of which occured in low-income households. 
As a result, the CDC issued an eviction moratorium, which temporarily stopped evictions in the U.S. 
Now that the moratorium has been lifted by the Supreme Court, evictions are on the rise. However, compared to historical averages, the eviction rates are 50% lower than pre-pandemic levels, though there is variation by city.
Rosales said she dedicated her life to protecting and advocating for renters in California. After attending college, Rosales witnessed the gentrification of her neighborhood  in the San Francisco Mission District and displacement of members of her community, including her father. After going to law school, Rosales focused primarily on defending renters. 
“After defending cases in Los Angeles and being in court every day, it kind of got to the point where I was like ‘There needs to be more I can do.’” Rosales said. “I can help an individual client, but for every one client who I help and is eligible for my services, there [are] about 5,000 that are also eligible for my services, and they don’t actually get the legal representation that they need.”
Rosales said individuals do not have to be attorneys to get involved with housing advocacy and invited law school students, undergraduate students and even high school students to follow their passion for fair housing policies. However, she highlighted the importance of tenants knowing their rights. 
“At every point in a person’s life, they’re most likely going to be a renter, and for most people, they’re one paycheck away from becoming homeless,” Rosales said. “So when you know your own individual rights, it’s easier then to pass that information on to other people and advocate for yourself and for others.”
Chika Ojukwu, a sophomore majoring in journalism, attended because she has always been interested in learning about the housing crisis. Ojukwu said evictions are common in her hometown of Miami. Now that she is in L.A., she wanted to see how evictions affect the population of California. 
“I think journalists are the ones who can give voice and give context to what’s happening,” Ojukwu said. “It’s our duty really to bring this attention to our readers and put a face to what’s happening.” 
Like Ojukwu, Rosales believes in the power of giving voice and context to tenant experiences is by talking about it on social media, going to public legislative hearings and using your voice to reclaim these stories. 
“We have a lot of power just by simply talking to other people because that’s where we can get, organizing, but that’s also where we can reclaim our stories, and speak them out to the world.”
A previous version of this article said Tina Rosales is an advocate for Western Center on Poverty and Law. The correct name is Western Center on Law and Poverty. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

When you think of a career in dance, you may think of all its glitz and glamour. However, Nina Gumbs, a senior majoring in dance, simply wanted to know how to afford rent while being a professional dancer. 
Dance has been in Gumbs’ life since she began at seven years old at a local studio in her hometown near Washington D.C. 
“Dance has just been something I have always understood,” Gumbs said. 
After years of training, she came to USC to major in dance. Gumbs started working with various commercial artists in Los Angeles shortly after coming to USC and began to ask herself many questions about dance and its industry. She questioned why dancers consistently had monetary issues, why there wasn’t generational wealth within dance and why dancers felt cheated out of certain monetary aspects.
“Dance as a market has not changed, art has progressed, music has progressed, entertainment as a whole has progressed, dance, honestly, has not progressed,” Gumbs said.
She noted that the dancers on Soul Train, a popular dance show from the 70s, were paid with fried chicken and dancers today are still being paid in a similar form of payment. 
“I think dancers are still economically mistreated or just unfairly treated when it comes to compensation or hours or just recognition,” said Wyeth Walker, a senior majoring in dance.
Looking for answers to her questions, Gumbs confided in Bobby Shields, a family friend. His answer was to start a business. So, along with Shields, she took the initiative and created Good Company LLC. 
“Good Company is really considered to be a family tool for every single dancer in the world,”  Shields said.
The mission of Good Company is to provide “all-encompassing services that merge dance and sound business decisions to create better work, a better dance experience,” according to Gumbs. The company works to educate dancers on how to read contracts, what to look for in a contract and how to advocate for oneself within the dance industry.
Good Company is “raising a new level of awareness in the [dance] industry,” according to Walker.
“Good Company focuses on helping people understand how to more equitably and fairly treat dancers, especially when it becomes the people across the casting table,” Walker said.
Besides majoring in dance, Gumbs is also minoring in entrepreneurship. For Gumbs, Good Company fused these two subject areas and passions of hers; the knowledge she received from her courses in entrepreneurship allowed her to question what business structures make up the dance industry, Gumbs said. 
“I think that is the key to understanding how we can better ourselves … you can change what you can understand and if you don’t understand that, then it’s really hard to change,” Gumbs said.
Establishing Good Company as a student provided Gumbs with the opportunity to help her fellow peers with their creative endeavors. Ciara Billups, a senior majoring in dance, said she used Good Company’s resources while the company was still in its early stages.
“I had a music video I was dancing in, and I did not know the artist. I was a little bit nervous going into it, and I was also asked questions about what my base pay rate was. I did not have many opportunities like that before, so I reached out to [Gumbs] and asked her,” Billups said. “She helped me put together a contract that also helped me negotiate pay.  It was just very helpful all around and made the experience a lot more professional than I think it would have been if I did not work with her and Good Company.”
Billups felt that her experience working with Good Company was helpful and made the experience feel more organized and professional — something she worried would not have happened without Gumbs’ help. 
Similarly, Anthony Tette, a senior majoring in dance, said he was drawn to Gumbs’ services because of the way it bridged the gap between the artist and the director. Tette worked alongside Good Company during the summer of 2021 for a project where contract and safety issues arose.
“At that moment, I panicked, and I thought to call Gumbs because I knew that she had started Good Company,” Tette said. “She was so receptive. [Gumbs] and her manager told me what my rights were and what I could do to help solve the situation.”
 Gumbs, with her company, acts as the middleman, Tette said. She interacts with two systems that hardly communicate with one another from an organizational lens. 
Both Billups and Tette said Gumbs’ work is powerful; it makes them feel supported knowing that they have someone with the knowledge of a dancer advocating for them and their rights. 
“I think it’s very powerful what [Gumbs’] doing, it always feels good to have an advocate for yourself … but to have somebody advocating for me who actually knows both dance and business is helpful and makes you feel supported,” Billups said.
At the core of her work with Good Company, Gumbs wants “good people to work with good people.” As Shields notes, Gumbs believes in supporting others’ dreams and ensuring dancers know there are ways to fight back in troubling situations. For the future of her company, Gumbs said she hopes Good Company will be full of people who want to do better for the world. 
“I am so inspired by the people that surround me every day,” Gumbs said. “I feel like I have good company around me all the time.”

Dieuwertje Kast remembers a day in a second grade class she worked as part of the Joint Educational Project where the students experienced the wonders of virtual reality for the first time. With a headset almost slipping off of his face, one student stared in awe at the safari animals that seemed to be standing before him and waved to each one as they passed by.
Now, AnitaB.org will recognize Kast as a recipient of the Social Impact Abie Award for her work in coordinating this experience by implementing technology, including 3D printing, raspberry pi devices and carbon dioxide sensors into the curricula of more than 29,000 local K-12 students. The global nonprofit, which will honor Kast during its Grace Hopper Celebration Sept. 27 to Oct. 1, recognizes five women annually who have used technology to create social change.
To Kast, these technological devices are “a large part of the tech future” that many students in low-income communities never get the chance to experience in elementary school. 
“We want students to be able to see some of this stuff so it’s not foreign to them as they continue to go through their own educational experience,” Kast said. 
As the director of STEM Education Programs at the USC JEP program Kast coordinates science and technology programming for low-income schools. JEP, a service-learning program based in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, places undergraduate students in schools, hospitals and nonprofits where they bring the topics they study in class into these spaces. 
Inspired by her father, who is also a scientist, Kast majored in biological sciences as an undergraduate at USC when she began her work with JEP. Since her time as an undergraduate, Kast has worked with JEP for 11 years. 
“Doing JEP myself when I was an undergrad really opened my eyes to what different people were going through,” Kast said. “I found that I liked the science education much more than I liked the science piece, and I wanted to continue to make a difference.”
Darin Gray, director of the Viterbi K-12 STEM Center, recalls a project Kast initiated in which she asked elementary school students to illustrate their vision of a scientist. The JEP team observed how the drawings changed over time and, by the end of the program, the students began to draw scientists that looked like them, rather than “the prototypical white male older gentleman with the crazy hair,” Gray said.
“When she shared that with me, it was just a fundamental shift in how we were doing STEM,” Gray said. “I thought about diversity, equity and inclusion, but I never really thought about how kids see scientists. They don’t see themselves.”
Gray met Kast when she first started working at USC. Since then, they have become close enough to have dinners with each other’s families. Gray even bought a multitude of science-themed ties, inspired by Kast’s affinity for science-themed clothing. 
“[Kast is] a great human being, and she really does care,” Gray said. “It shows in the work that she does, and in the way she carries herself and her willingness to even learn and connect with people.”
Kast continually emphasizes the importance of students learning directly from scientists. When one of the elementary schools she works with had a space unit, Kast made it a priority to bring in a number of astronauts of color, including Sian Proctor, the first Black female pilot of a spacecraft. Kast also brought in an astronaut who incorporated art into her career when another student expressed a passion for science and drawing. 
“It blew [the student’s] mind, just realizing that there are so many different possibilities, that you can combine your love of science and art, and make that a career,” Kast said. 
Susan Harris, executive director of JEP, remembers when Kast connected students at Vermont Elementary School with astronauts on the International Space Station in real-time by attaching a satellite to the school’s roof building. The event required an abundance of coordination: Kast had to call all of the students together at a very specific time while simultaneously livestreaming the event to every other school she had partnered with. 
“It was just such an exciting thing to see the students respond when they first made contact with the astronauts and being able to ask questions directly,” Harris said. “[It is] characteristic of the kinds of amazing things that [Kast] can pull off effectively.”
Looking forward, Kast wants to expand into education beyond just creating lesson plans and hosting workshops. Specifically, she wishes to train elementary school teachers in STEM education so they can pass it down to their students. 
“Research has shown that teachers that are uncomfortable with science and technology don’t use it in their classrooms,” Kast said. “Especially in kindergarten through third grade, some teachers just skip it and then the kids don’t get a basic introduction to science until they’re in fourth grade. Then it’s already too late.”
Kast is the recipient of numerous other science education awards, including both the Forbes 30 Under 30 in Science Award and the North American Association Environmental Education “EE 30 under 30 Award” in 2016. When Harris heard Kast won the Social Impact Abie Award, she “wasn’t all that surprised.”
“I mean, her work is incredible,” Harris said. “She’s sought after and recognized frequently for her work so this was another feather in her cap. I’m just incredibly proud of her.” 
Kast will be recognized at AnitaB.org’s virtual celebration, which began Monday and will run until Friday.

The United States Men’s National team can’t seem to catch a break.
In the midst of a grueling World Cup Qualifying campaign, the Americans haven’t been able to field a complete first team (or, rather, the first team I agree with) because of a myriad of injuries and suspensions. It looks like the situation got worse in the lead up to the U.S.’s next three games. Star winger Christian Pulisic has yet to play since suffering an ankle injury against Honduras. On the other side of the attack, winger Gio Reyna is still out with a hamstring injury as well.
So, the USMNT will be missing its two best attackers for three crucial games. Tough luck for a team that already needs a lot to be going its way. Nonetheless, an updated 26-man roster has been released for the next international break, and here are some of the players who jump out to me.
Yunus Musah, midfielder, 19
The highly touted dual-national chose the USMNT over England, Ghana and Italy. In fact, he played over 30 games for England at youth levels before committing to play for the U.S. Ever since then, he’s been on my radar as a guy that needs as much playing time as possible. At his home club Valencia, Musah burst onto the scene as a versatile midfielder who can also run the wings.
The role that best suits him, in my opinion, is the box-to-box midfielder role, as his stamina and awareness are always useful in the middle of the pitch. Weston McKennie already occupies this position for the first team, but I wouldn’t mind them side-by-side in the midfield. Musah would also be able to navigate attacking spaces better with his agility. In this case, Tyler Adams would need to be a lock for the defensive midfield role, creating a midfield trio that the U.S. could roll with for years to come. Musah has loads of potential and can be slotted into wherever manager Gregg Berhalter needs him to be in the upcoming games.
Timothy Weah, forward, 21 
The son of soccer legend George Weah, Timothy has had the attention of the U.S. faithful for some time now. He was the first player born in the 2000s to earn a senior cap for the U.S. He got some needed game time in the CONCACAF Nations League and was one of the biggest bright spots when he came on against Mexico in the 60th minute of the final. His central claim to being involved in the national team is his work at French club Lille, where he was a part of their shock title run in the Ligue 1 last season.
Weah will likely play on the wings, as his combination of pace and agility will pose threats from the outside of the pitch. It’s yet to be determined whether he will develop into a player who can finish goals as well as create them, but I personally see this as a possible outcome for him, with his experience playing striker. I would love for Weah to get more minutes, especially in matches where his pace can be used to get in behind opposition defenses. 
Matthew Hoppe, forward, 20
Hoppe first made his name known by scoring goals for German side Schalke 04 in the Bundesliga last season. This earned him a roster spot on the USMNT Gold Cup team, where he put in top performances on his way to winning the tournament.
Hoppe was one of the names people were throwing out there as a lock for making the preliminary World Cup Qualifying roster, and while he didn’t do that, he’s on the team now and ready to make an impact. I’ve always seen Hoppe as a striker — he can stand his ground and has the pace and finishing ability to make attacking runs — but he was deployed as a left winger in the Gold Cup.
To my surprise, Hoppe made the most of his reps at that position. I wouldn’t be opposed to him playing at left wing in the next few games, especially considering striker Ricardo Pepi has cemented his role as the starting No. 9. 
Zack Steffen, goalkeeper, 26
After missing the last trio of games because of testing positive for the coronavirus, Zack Steffen, the backup goalkeeper for Manchester City, will return to his national team. In his absence, Matt Turner has been effective as USMNT goalkeeper, generating a lot of hype around his performances, so I wouldn’t be surprised if Berhalter rolls with the hot gloves in the next few games.
That being said — and I’ve expressed this sentiment before — nothing can replace experience in training, and Steffen saves shots from some of the best players in the world almost every day. I believe Steffen is the better option for that reason, but I won’t get too upset if Turner gets another chance to prove he’s the No. 1 keeper on the roster. 
Weston McKennie, midfielder, 23
While McKennie was technically on the roster last time around, I’m writing about him since he’ll be returning to the side for the first time since the El Salvador game. McKennie was the talk of the town during the first international break, following up what I believe was his worst performance in a USMNT shirt against El Salvador with poor off-the-field decisions (he spent a night outside the team’s bubble and also brought an unauthorized person into the bubble), which led to him being suspended from the team for the games against Canada and Honduras.
While I still have doubts about McKennie’s commitment to the team after this controversy, I am confident he’s still the best American midfielder on his day. It was clear that the U.S. missed his presence in the midfield in the second and third games, as he brings a unique blend of physicality and mobility so crucial for a box-to-box midfielder. Even though I was highly critical of him after his play in the El Salvador game, I know the kind of player he can be for the team, and I feel confident he can return to his top level. 
The Americans will begin the international break by hosting last-place Jamaica in Austin, Texas. Next is an away game against Panama, who currently has five points and sits just below the U.S. on goals scored. The final fixture will be back at home versus Costa Rica.
Every single game that the USMNT plays in World Cup Qualifying from here on out is crucial. The Americans have a huge chance to separate themselves from the teams below them in the standings. I’m still making sure to reserve my hopes (as always with this team), but a few wins would put the U.S. in a stellar position moving forward.

Coming off a historic loss, USC will take on Colorado Saturday in Boulder, Colo. USC has never lost in 14 games total against Colorado.
Saturday’s game was interim head coach Donte Williams’ first loss since he took over the position from former head coach Clay Helton. It was the first time in 61 years USC lost in a home game against Oregon State.
“I learned that I just need to work harder and everybody needs to get better,” Williams said. “Everybody needs to do a little more than what they’re doing before.”
USC’s season is far from over. Still remaining are games against No. 20 UCLA, No. 9 Notre Dame, Arizona State among other remaining games. Williams is focusing on the moment and the coming game this weekend.
“That game’s over, I can’t change that,” Williams said. “All I expect is for us to win today, win tomorrow and win on Saturday.”
USC committed 11 penalties along with four turnovers during the game against Oregon State. Offensive coordinator Graham Harrell commented on the major factors that slowed down the Trojans.
“The two false starts on third down were big mistakes because we had a 3rd and 1 that was going to be an easy conversion, and we needed to get the momentum back right there,” Harrell said. “There [were] a lot of good things on that tape we didn’t execute when we needed to the most.”
Junior quarterback Kedon Slovis had a rough outing against Oregon State, throwing three interceptions. Slovis remains positive about the team’s performance and believes the team’s potential has yet to fully show.
“I thought at times we were playing really fluid, loose and really fast. It kind of slowed down in the second half. That’s something we really have to just keep building on,” Slovis said. “It’s just a few little things. Once we’ve cleaned those up, we’ll see a lot of success.”
Colorado has a strong offensive threat in sophomore running back Jarek Broussard, who was the Pac-12 Offensive Player of the Year in 2020. The Trojans gave up over 300 rushing yards against Oregon State, as the front seven weren’t able to contain the Beavers’ strong ground attack. In reference to Broussard, Williams said, “it’s going to be a challenge.”
The game between USC (2-2, 1-2) and Colorado (1-3, 0-1) will kick off at 11 a.m. Saturday at Folsom Field.

We write as USC community members who are united in a commitment to fair labor practices on our campus. In recent decades, higher education observers have witnessed the casualization of instruction staff, shrinking tenure-stream employment, ballooning student debt, outsourcing of campus labor including facilities and cafeteria workers, and “administrative bloat” that grows managerial ranks and salaries out of proportion. These problems are all well-known in their general contours, but they take specific forms here at USC, and the Trojan Family should know about it.
Did you know that the USC instructor workforce is about 40% full-time research, teaching, practitioner & clinical and only about 20% tenured and tenure-track? That means that nearly 40% of the people who teach full-time on campus have less job security than tenure-stream faculty, and they are also paid significantly less while teaching more students. 
At 20% tenure-stream USC is below the national average, which is in the 25 to 30% range, despite the size of our university endowment. An additional 40% of professors at USC are adjuncts, but this is a complex category which is hard to generalize across units: Some are working professionals who choose to teach on the side to contribute to the University, while others may be eking out a living teaching full-time at a substandard wage. 
No matter their titles, most USC instructors provide true excellence in their teaching and possess stellar research and clinical expertise. Although students expect quality education in many subject domains, what kind of a moral and civic education does USC provide? 
If college campuses are meant to lead by example, they have gone badly astray in how they treat their own workers. According to leaders of the USC chapter of the American Association of University Professors, an anonymous faculty survey conducted by them revealed that some instructors have delayed or deferred medical care and even sought public assistance while working for USC. The cost of living in Los Angeles is notoriously high, but surely the second-largest private employer in L.A. County can do better for its staff and faculty.
USC’s disreputable labor practices extend beyond our classrooms, reaching into the residential halls, care facilities and the logistical underbelly of the school, where many workers struggle to gain fair and equitable treatment. Nurses at Keck Hospital of USC, who have experienced exceptionally difficult labor conditions, went on strike over the summer. While their efforts were ultimately successful, the fact that a strike was necessary to obtain basic safety measures and adequate compensation illustrates administrators’ reluctance to acknowledge the campus workforce’s value.
USC’s ambivalence toward its workforce spans not only departments and facilities but also time. Labor disputes at USC are almost as traditional as tailgates. In the 1990s, a campaign with an 11-day hunger strike and mass arrests resulted in victory for protesters when the administration threatened to replace cleaning and catering employees with sub-contracted workers. Students and faculty are impoverished insofar as historical memory is concerned: The former have little knowledge as to what occurred prior to their arrival, and the latter are encouraged to keep their labor siloed from other campus workforces.
Measures that would shore up protections for campus workers are currently under consideration in Congress, which would in turn offer students a learning environment where campuses live the values they preach. These include the requirement that 75% of campus instructors hold tenure-stream positions at all federally funded institutions, which will include contingent instructors and allow them tenure protections for the work they are already doing, and a guaranteed living wage for all campus workers.
This is our case that we bring toward the USC community: 
We ask only that you look inward, toward our great University’s intellectual, social and moral duties and obligations. The Trojan Way should be to treat the entire community — all students and workers — fairly and equitably. If we are to be the world-class university we claim to be, shouldn’t basic fairness toward our own community, and a proudly displayed moral compass, be among our prime directives?

Growing up vegetarian, I always dreaded school trips that ended in a stop at McDonald’s or Burger King. While everyone else boarded the bus enjoying their Chicken McNuggets and Happy Meals, I left the Golden Arches with a cold slice of American cheese sandwiched in a hamburger bun.
Although I did not enjoy the average fast-food stop, I loved processed garbage as much as the next kid. I just happened to love it in the form of a seven-layer burrito covered in Taco Bell’s signature hot sauce. At Taco Bell, I never had to scour the menu for the single uninspired option that fit my dietary constraint. Every item on the menu became accessible to me with the magic words: sub beans for beef.
Taco Bell goes one step further than offering modifications for vegetarian and vegan customers by dropping new menu items that cater to diverse diets. In 2019, Taco Bell released the Black Bean Crunchwrap Supreme, transforming one of its most iconic and successful menu items into an option for its vegetarian consumers. Taco Bell is one of the few places where my dietary restriction feels more like an asset than an obstacle.
It is simply a fact that Taco Bell is the crown jewel of fast food. As a Californian, my love for In-N-Out Burger runs deep, but as a lifelong vegetarian, it is hard to ignore the fact that its underwhelming fries are the only meatless option on its traditional menu. Most restaurants add vegetarian and vegan dishes to their menu as an afterthought, but Taco Bell has shown other fast-food chains that diverse menus are a priority.
Despite its controversial decision to remove the beloved Mexican Pizza from the menu, Taco Bell retains my loyalty. However, it remains inaccessible for those with more specific dietary restraints, such as gluten intolerance. While Taco Bell has some options that may help you avoid gluten, it does not ensure that any of its menu items are gluten-free. The meal itself may not contain gluten, however, gluten is a protein that can be easily transferred through packaging or handling. For anyone with a gluten allergy or Celiac disease, a packaging mishap could have detrimental health effects.
For those with dietary restrictions, the issue goes far beyond not being able to grab a quesadilla from Taco Bell. Grocery stores that offer food options for a range of diets, such as Whole Foods and Trader Joe’s, are concentrated in wealthy neighborhoods. A study by RCLCO, a real estate firm, showed that the presence of Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s can result in a 6% increase in neighborhood rent prices. 
Grocery stores with diverse products can expand to low-income neighborhoods, which would vastly increase the food options for the community. However, this often leads to widespread gentrification, which prices out the residents who need access to dietary restriction-friendly foods. As a result, low-income individuals have little to no access to these necessities.  
Not only are diverse food options inaccessible, but they are also often more expensive, making it even more difficult for someone facing poverty to find food that caters to their diet. A 2018 study run by the School of Food Science and Nutrition at the University of Leeds shows that gluten-free products are 159% more expensive than traditional ingredients on average. Similarly, lactose-free milk is generally 30% more expensive than regular milk. 
It requires more time and money to find a grocery store that fits your needs, but once you get there, the food itself may be out of your budget. Dietary restrictions stack on top of existing poverty, which exacerbates food insecurity for those with non-traditional diets. 
Community funded food pantries or soup kitchens can rarely afford more expensive ingredients to make meals for those with special dietary needs. These solutions for food insecurity leave behind low-income individuals with diverse diets.
It is hard to imagine an accessible and affordable food industry in a country that prioritizes economic success over health and well-being. In our capitalist society, corporations rarely take actions unless they will turn a profit. In a sea of fast-food chains devoid of vegan and vegetarian options, Taco Bell is a beacon of hope. 
Although it is far from perfect, Taco Bell has shown other fast-food joints that offering accommodations can be profitable. Going a step further than Taco Bell, organizations such as the National Celiac Association and The Gluten Free Food Bank tackle food insecurity from a more inclusive, community-minded lens.
Apart from taxes, eating is the only constant in our lives. Food is more than just a necessity — it is a part of who we are, from our health to our happiness. Regardless of class, every person should have the opportunity to choose foods that maximize their health and happiness. Accessible and affordable food restores that health and happiness for many suffering from food insecurity. Taco Bell allowing customers to substitute beans for beef is a great start, but there is still work to be done — both on a governmental and community level — to make food more equitable.
