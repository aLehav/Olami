As more students live in the area around USC, more brand-name retail stores will come to the neighborhood, according to Manuel Pastor, a professor of American studies and ethnicity.
Expansion · As USC becomes a more residential community, more brand-name retail stores are expected to move into the area, according to a Price study. - Xi Wang | Daily Trojan
Lower income areas tend to have one or two “mom-and-pop” stores for specific needs rather than large retail chains or supermarkets, according to a study conducted at the Price School of Public Policy and Development.
In “Are Poor Neighborhoods ‘Retail Deserts’?,” Jenny Schuetz, an assistant professor of public policy, found lower income areas have less competition and thus higher prices, even though residents would most benefit from lower prices.
“Low-income households presumably have the most to gain from lower prices, made possible by economies of scale, yet are less likely to benefit from [economies of scale],” Schuetz said.
Pastor, an expert in economic and social conditions in low-income urban communities, said having more students around the University Park Campus has changed the retail landscape.
“USC has made a major shift to become a residential community,” Pastor said. “Lower income areas tend to be [ignored by] major retail chains.”
What these stores don’t realize,  Pastor said, is that they should be happy to invest in poorer neighborhoods because of the appeal of the goods they sell.
“People in lower income areas do tend to spend a lot of money on food, medicines and other necessities,” Pastor said.
Pastor predicts that more chain stores will continue to open in the area around USC, as they have during the last 10 to 15 years. He said the community would benefit from stores, such as Trader Joe’s, associated with higher income areas.
“I don’t think the creation of full-service stores, like Trader Joe’s, would hurt the community,” Pastor said. “It would help deliver food of decent quality at a lower price by introducing more competition for other stores.”
He explained that the neighborhood’s families will ultimately benefit from greater competition between grocery stores.
Pastor said he believes both USC students and the neighborhood should be excited about upcoming initiatives by USC, such as the newly opening Fresh & Easy Express under University Gateway and The Village at USC, plans that call for a sprawling collection of entertainment, dining and retail options, along with a cornucopia of new student housing north of Jefferson Boulevard.
Lauren Taniguchi, a sophomore majoring in public relations, expressed some misgivings about The Village at USC providing balance between student needs and the needs of the community.
“Honestly, I was surprised when I saw the plans online. Even the architect [of The Village] is the same one who worked on The Grove,” Taniguchi said. “The new plans will really shake things up. I don’t know what stores they’re specifically putting in, but I guess they’ve done enough research to determine what’s appropriate.”
Divakar Singamsetty, a sophomore majoring in mechanical engineering, said the current University Village is inadequate, and Target and a large grocery chain store, like Albertsons, should open in place of Superior Grocers.
“The only useful store there is Superior, and the quality of the food isn’t that good,” Singamsetty said. “They need to accommodate more student needs closer to campus, like larger availability of eateries and small retail stores. As you go farther out, the community’s needs should be more carefully considered.”
Taniguchi thinks the stores in the University Village are adequate.
“They meet the needs of both the students and the neighborhood pretty well. It’s convenient, not far and has everything you need with groceries and other things,” Taniguchi said. “With everything on Figueroa [Street], like Fresh & Easy, already catering to student needs, it’s clear that the area and people need the U.V. more than the students do.”
I grew up in the North Carolina area and I was very surprised to see how few grocery shopping options there were in the USC area. University Village is inadequate. This is 2012. USC cannot even compare to the retail environment around schools like UNC, UVA, Wake Forest or Duke.  My daughter attends USC and is ok with it but my other kids are not getting my dollars for this school as the administration appears nonchalant about improving the surroundings. They are followers, not leaders in terms of collegiate environment.
Last time I checked, America was a free market economy. Has that changed, or can private enterprises still decide where they want to invest and open businesses?
SC’s in the hood, just accept it. Certain businesses won’t come here for “strategic reasons.” But we all know it’s more like “we ain’t coming to the hood, it’ll tarnish our image.”
The community not only needs brand name stores but childcare facilities to. Families like Staff also have children which require daycare and cannot afford the current highly overpriced USC provided childcare.
Tanaguchi, why are you implying the “community ” has different needs then USC students?
Because it DOES have different needs/desires. USC students want an inexpensive, well-maintained, almost generic place to get their groceries. They are unfamiliar with the area and thus want a safe, familiar chain close to campus. The rest of the community wants and needs smaller, “mom and pop” shops, as was stated in the article.

The USC Office of Sustainability has updated its Green Certification Program to make offices on campus more sustainable.
For an office at USC to be certified, a member — known as a Green Office Leader — of the Office of Sustainability teaches office members how to be more environmentally friendly using an online calculator.
The calculator has a checklist that examines an office’s sustainability level. The office can receive a bronze, silver, gold or platinum certification based on how many points it earns. The certification lasts two years and can then be re-certified.
The Green Office Calculator is based on eight different aspects of sustainability: green information technology, networking and awareness, recycling, food and beverage, transportation, energy management, office supplies and innovations.
The changes that were made to the Green Certification Program were mainly focused on how involved individuals are.
Elliott Lavi, the student liaison for the Green Office Certification Program, said the program was developed to cater to all offices on campus regardless of their current level of sustainability.
“We created possibilities for every single person in the workplace to be sustainable,” Lavi said. “It used to be a macro-concept, but we added individual concepts so people can take initiative on their own.”
There are currently 27 offices and organizations on campus that are certified by the program, including the Trojan Marching Band office, the Southern California Earthquake Center and the Office of Religious Life.
The Green Certification Program aims to implement sustainable practices in offices and to help save the university money, Lavi said.
“The program gives every student, staff and faculty member a framework to reduce waste and energy, making it effective for the environment and giving multiple ways to save thousands of dollars for the university,” Lavi said.
Louis LeMesurier, a sophomore majoring in biological sciences, said the program will help the university become more environmentally friendly.
“I look forward to being a part of a greener USC,” LeMesurier said. “I recognize the green grading system as a realization of USC’s green responsibilities.”
Mary Stepanyan, a junior majoring in human development and aging, said the Green Office Program provides members of the university with an opportunity to make a positive impact on the environment.
“The environment is a crucial part of our everyday lives. I think the Green Office Program is a great way to encourage people to be more sustainable and eco-friendly,” Stepanyan said.
The USC Office of Sustainability was founded in 2009 and launched the Green Certification Program in fall 2010.
I think the university needs to do more in regards to reclaiming ad repurposing waste as I have seen instances where university policy works directly against this. For instance, removing something usable from the trash is considered misuse of university assets.

“It’s Not For Women.” With a slogan like that in Terminator-esque font, it’s no wonder Dr Pepper Ten has come under fire for sexist marketing.
TV ads, radio spots and a Facebook page asking “Are You Man Enough?” provoked feminist outrage when the campaign launched last October.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
The soda seemed to fly under the radar for a few months, but in the last few weeks there has been a renewed radio and television push for the drink. And Seeds Marketplace has added the soda to its beverages section.
Fellow Trojans: Don’t buy the stuff, lest you reinforce the idea that sexist advertising works. Let Dr. Pepper Ten die — and let it remind other brands to think twice before excluding an entire gender.
Dr Pepper has never been one for conventional advertising. While Coca-Cola has a stranglehold on Santa Claus and polar bears and while Pepsi uses danceclub scenes to hawk its bubbly, Dr Pepper has opted for T-shirt-ready slogans, such as “Wouldn’t you like to be a Pepper, too?” and claymation fairytale support groups. Going non-traditional with a gender-specific campaign like this one is yet another bold move in Dr Pepper’s marketing repertoire, but it might cost them loyal customers.
If Dr Pepper was trying to imitate the Old Spice guy, it missed by a mile. Instead of simply adopting a masculine tone, the ads specifically exclude women. It’s the Little Rascals of diet drinks: No Girls Allowed.
The commercials lay it out clearly: With Dr Pepper Ten, “You can keep the romantic comedies and lady drinks. We’re good.”
By gearing the ads so intensely toward men, Dr Pepper is reducing potential profits. The company is alienating half the soda drinking population before they even pop the tab.
Was launching Dr Pepper Ten and marketing it to an exclusively male customer-base a solid business decision? Not even close. Making minute, insignificant changes to an existing product and repackaging it will only compromise the existing market for lower calorie Dr Pepper.
You have to question why anyone saw Dr Pepper Ten as necessary in the first place. According to Dave Fleming, Dr Pepper-Snapple Group’s director of marketing, the company was responding to male consumers’ demand for “a low calorie option with the full flavor of regular Dr Pepper.”
Isn’t the entire Diet Dr Pepper campaign based on the idea that it tastes more like its forebearing full-calorie soda than any other diet drink? To produce another diet soda negates Diet Dr Pepper’s main selling point. It’s not a particularly “girly” advertising strategy, so why go so masculine?
And if the company truly believed that it is not reaching calorie-conscious men with the current Diet Dr Pepper ads, why not just try a different marketing strategy?
It’s better than blindly investing in the cost of researching, producing and marketing an entirely different soda. That is poor business.
Dr Pepper Ten appeals to one type of man. Blatant sexism aside, the ad campaign suggests that the soda is only suitable for men who like explosions, guns and car chases. I guess it isn’t for men who enjoy the occasional piña colada or episode of Grey’s Anatomy.
According to BevReview.com, the mid-calorie offering still has copious amounts of aspartame, the sweetening agent that has raised eyebrows regarding carcinogenicity. That knocks out any health-conscious people — male or female — who might have chosen Dr Pepper Ten as an alternative.
Of course, all this seems like speculation — until you take a look at Dr. Pepper’s Brand Index Buzz scores. The Brand Index scores are to consumer goods what approval ratings are to the president: They gauge customer appreciation on any given brand. At the launch of Dr Pepper Ten, Dr Pepper took an immediate hit. Within a week, their buzz score dropped five points among men and 14 points among women.
They may be the 10 hardest working calories in soda, but effort doesn’t always make up for idiocy.
 
Katherine Moncrief is a senior majoring in international relations. 
Wouldn’t it be way MORE feminist to go drink a whole bunch of it and enjoy it?
As far as being a poor business decision, let me tell you right now its a solid, effective one. The reason why lies with the fact that women, and “men who enjoy the occasional pina colada” as you put it, already enjoy the existing diet drinks. The alpha male is currently a market that has not been reached by a diet beverage, so Dr. Pepper can reach this demographic through these targeted advertisements without cannibalizing their other product lines. On top of this, if their advertising was more “inclusive,” its appeal to alpha males would vanish and it would likely fail flat on its face–either attracting few new customers or cannibalizing existing customers from other product lines like Diet Dr. Pepper. 
My background is as a finance major and have worked finance internships outside of school so I can tell you right now that a discounted cash flow of this project would take out any cannibalization of existing lines; the targeted appeal was a solid business decision. I am curious what your business background is which gave you grounds to analyze it from that standpoint. 
The point of my comment is this: If you are against it in principle, please continue to enlighten us on the ethics of sexist marketing. But do not hide behind calling this a poor business decision because you want it to fail for non-business reasons and use that as the basis for insulting their intelligence. Its unfortunate that non-business majors will likely believe your bogus claims.
Crazy, you aren’t really making much of a point there, since you are actually talking about things biologically designed for a certain gender, species, whatnot. Unless they’ve done something to soda that I don’t know about, it isn’t actually designed specifically for male physiology. 
I’m not one to get all riled up over this kind of thing, but I do see blatant sexism in this particular marketing plan, which seems downright illogical for a business to do..risk alienate half of their consumers? Why?
Please see the comment above with regards to why they would alienate half of the demographic
Katherine, getting your panties in a bunch over these ads is like a man getting upset over Virginia Slims cigarettes making men feel they are being excluded. Why would a cigarette company exclude half the population for dear sakes ! This is a clear sign our politically over-correct society has gone completely crazy and seek to be offended when no offense exists. Please feel free to not be offended. Believe me it may feel hard at first but it is really possible. BTW, I am sure your reaction is exactly what Dr Pepper ppl were looking for. They are thanking you for a full page ad in the DT bringing attention to their product.
I completely agree with you, Ras.  And I’m a female.  Let’s also cite Secret antiperspirant: “Strong enough for a man, but pH balanced for a woman.”  Coke did it with Tab Pink as well, marketing to women.  We middle-aged folk ought to be outraged about products marketed to only young people.  Or mad that Centrum Silver is only for the elderly.  Or that only dogs should eat dog food.  Enough already!

Actress Eva Longoria encouraged students to volunteer and maintain a passion for learning beyond undergraduate studies at a question-and-answer session presented by the USC Latino Alumni Association, USC Spectrum and Verizon on Saturday at Bovard Auditorium.
Philanthropy · Actress Eva Longoria spoke Saturday night at Bovard Auditorium. Longoria showed a clip from her new documentary, highlighting undocumented farm-working children in the United States. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
An Evening with Eva hosted by Josh Kun, a professor of communication, drew more than 500 attendees to hear Longoria speak about her work outside of acting, which includes advocating for immigration legislation, domestic and international philanthropy and documentary filmmaking.
“Education and philanthropy have always been two really big tent poles in my life,” Longoria said. “That was where my social position started. I find acting the smallest part of what I’m put on this earth to do. I find that it was the catalyst for me having a voice, but it was never my intention.”
Longoria cited the women in her family as role models, including her mentally disabled sister and her mother, a special education teacher.
The 36-year-old actress, is currently pursuing a master’s degree in Chicano studies and political science at Cal State Northridge while starring in the eighth and final season of ABC’s Desperate Housewives.
A ninth-generation American and native of Corpus Cristi, Texas, Longoria reflected on having to defy the stereotypes placed on Latinos in Hollywood when she moved to Los Angeles in 1998. Longoria said she was often complimented on her clear English during auditions, but would be asked to speak with a Mexican accent.
“I had the journey of doors being not closed, but labeled,” Longoria said.
She described herself as fervently interested in her Spanish, Mexican and Texan ancestry, which led her to pursue a master’s degree.
She also showcased a clip from Harvest, the documentary she is executive producing. The documentary follows the lives of undocumented farm-working children in the United States who migrate state-to-state to follow seasonal crops.
“The children are stuck in a cycle of poverty and they can’t get an education,” Longoria said. “They have to follow the harvest. They’re not engaged in curriculum or with their teachers.”
Vice President for Student Affairs Michael L. Jackson attended the event and praised Longoria for her work in the Latino community.
“It’s really a great opportunity for USC to hear from a great representative from the Latino community,” Jackson said.
Billy Vela, director of El Centro Chicano at USC, said Longoria is setting a positive example for students by using her fame as a vehicle for raising awareness.
“She’s someone who has really been a success story and a great example for [the Latino] community,” Vela said. “But more important than that is her ability to use that platform to not only get to understand herself and our community better, but the ability to translate that into actually using her star status to put a light on important issues.”
Longoria said she is lucky to be a well-known figure, but others should not be discouraged from becoming involved in volunteer work despite the stigmas surrounding it.
“Sometimes people think of philanthropy and they go, ‘That’s something rich, famous people do,’” Longoria said. “It’s not. The people that make philanthro-capitalism work are everyday people and volunteers.”
Will Riley, a freshman majoring in Spanish and philosophy, politics and law, did not expect Longoria to focus heavily on political and social discourses at the event.
“I didn’t really know anything about her before the event,” Riley said. “She went a long way toward educating people on some very important issues that everyone should know about, especially with the presidential elections coming up.”
Jorge Trujillo, a freshman majoring in business administration, said he was encouraged by Longoria’s passion to make practical changes.
“I really liked the fact that she was a lot more than what she is perceived as,” Trujillo said. “A lot of Hollywood people aren’t as educated as you would think and she definitely surprised me in that. Everyone thinks of immigration as a problem, but she thinks of ways to help fix it — to help the people involved fix it.”
After Desperate Housewives goes off the air, Longoria said she plans on taking time off from acting. She plans on campaigning for President Barack Obama’s re-election, completing her master’s degree and traveling to Israel to learn more about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Longoria advised students to pay their opportunities forward.
“I’ve been given this amazing life, and I’ve got to give back ten-fold,” Longoria said. “You have to start giving back if you want to receive.”

USC should make fresh food and non-bottled water more accessible. 
I strongly agree with Tim Clayton’s opinion column “USC promotes healthy eating, doesn’t deliver,” published Feb. 7. Though the university might encourage nutrition with its words, it fails to make healthy food available and affordable for students. USC Hospitality should immediately make two sweeping policy changes: Serve more fresh vegetables in the dining halls and make water a viable drink option in the food courts.
First, The Parkside Restaurant and EVK Restaurant and Grill should serve more fresh vegetables in their buffets. How is it that rice and potatoes can be served in three to five different dishes, but it is rare to find even a single dish of steamed broccoli or some other vegetable?
Second, food courts, such as Café 84 and the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, should begin offering larger cups for students to drink water. The current cups are tiny — barely 8 oz., maybe even smaller. The university sells bottles of water and offers tiny cups purely to drive more profit. Why punish students who want to drink healthy, save money and prevent the waste of large plastic bottles of water?
These two changes would be a small start in improving students’ diets, but they would offer great benefits to students and would prove that the university is serious about getting healthy.

Freshman, undeclared
I wish The type of menu served at galen dining hall was available all over campus. Either that or a bigger fresher salad bar in the student center similar to the one at cafe 84. Why is it so hard to serve healthy options and instead pack in fast food chains?
Good points John although Parkside is 5 stars compared to EVK at 2 stars. Why aren’t all cafeterias like Parkside? Don’t get it.

Soda, chips, candy … Plan B?
Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania decided to allow students to buy Plan B from on-campus vending machines after surveys showed that 85 percent of students favored the option.
Though the university is facing criticism, Schippensburg is ultimately showing that it cares for its students by creating easier access to an essential contraceptive tool.
Max Rubin | Daily Trojan
Plan B, or any similar emergency contraception, can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to prevent the implantation of a potentially fertilized egg. The sooner the pill is taken, the better the protection against an unplanned pregnancy.
The vending machines at Shippensburg have been strategically placed in a private room in the university’s health center, away from vending machines supplying snacks, to reduce the potential confusion of someone who wants M&Ms but gets Plan B instead.
Despite the existing avenues for obtaining Plan B, USC should follow in Schippensburg’s steps. These vending machines have the potential to offer an amazing resource for students.
State and federal laws have made emergency contraception more accessible, allowing more women to avoid unwanted pregnancies. Nationwide, emergency contraception is offered without a prescription to anyone over the age of 17, but the buyer must talk to a pharmacist to receive it.
Needing to talk to a pharmacist, however, creates another barrier. Women might be embarrassed about admitting to unprotected sex, and some pharmacists might refuse to sell Plan B on moral grounds. Providing Plan B in vending machines moves toward completely removing barriers to access.
One could argue that if someone is too embarrassed to talk to their pharmacist in order to get Plan B, maybe they should abstain from having sex. Sex is a private matter, however, and not everyone is comfortable talking about the reason why they are seeking Plan B. People should not have to fear judgment from others if they need access to contraceptives.
Many people who oppose Plan B vending machines believe that the easy access downplays the fact that it is a medication, one which requires advice and side effect information from a clinician or pharmacist.
At this point, The Federal Drug Administration commissioner has made a statement supporting the over-the-counter use of Plan B for women 17 and over. The FDA also suggested the drug should be over-the-counter for girls under 17 as well, but the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services rejected that proposal.
Essentially, the FDA says that women and their partners are intelligent enough to figure out how to take one or two pills properly without significant adverse side effects. Shippensburg University also supplies information on the side effects, and physicians are available for consultation.
The side effects of Plan B include period-like symptoms, such as menstrual bleeding, stomach cramps, nausea and changes in consequent menstrual cycles. These are symptoms most women have experience with their regular period. As with any over-the-counter drug, if a woman feels uncomfortable with her symptoms, she should contact her health care provider or pharmacist immediately.
Putting the morning-after pill in vending machines allows students to take personal health into their own hands. We don’t need to coddle college students under the guise of protecting them by restricting access to pregnancy prevention measures.
Administrators should focus on encouraging students to make intelligent decisions; ultimately, though, they should respect students’ ability to make tough personal choices.
Emergency contraception is currently available without a prescription at the pharmacy or from a clinician at the University Park Health Center for $20. The pharmacy is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday, and the health center is open Monday through Thursday 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m., except Wednesday when it opens at 9:30 a.m. — check hours online for Friday and weekends. The local CVS pharmacy sells Plan B for $54 and the generic for $44.
 
Natalie Chau, Brooke Sanders and Lucas Griffin are peer health educators of the Office of Wellness and Health Promotion.
Actually, the effectiveness 24 hours after intercourse is 95%.  That drops to 89% after 72 hours and decreases from there.  Most studies use 50-60% effectiveness of Plan B used up to 5 days after.  Better than nothing??  Yes.  Ideal?? No.  Currently, the only FDA approved medication for emergency contraception for up to 5 days is Ella. Wouldn’t it be best to make an informed decision rather than take the advice of a vending machine?
Actually, the authors are correct: according to the National Institute of Health, Emergency contraception (including Plan B) may still prevent pregnancy for up to 5 days after unprotected sex.
Unfortunately, your authors make the point for not having Plan B available via vending machines.  Plan B is used for unprotected sex up to 72 hours (3 days) after intercourse, not 5 days.  Ella is the product used for unprotected intercourse up to 5 days after.  It is available only by prescription.  It is for reasons such as this that Plan B shouldn’t be accessible from vending machines and women should speak to a health care provider before taking.  
Additionally, it’s the Food and Drug Administration, not the Federal Drug Administratiion.  Probably should get your federal agencies straight also!

A well-rested Trojan men’s volleyball team took the court at the Galen Center Friday night, sweeping the Waves by a score of 25-23, 27-25, and 25-16.
Flying high · Freshman middle blocker Robert Feathers and the Trojans defeated Pepperdine Friday. They now stand at 6-4 overall. - Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Playing for the first time in almost a week, the Trojans held off furious Pepperdine comebacks in the first two sets, then cruised in the third and clinching set to improve their record for 6-4 overall, with a 5-4 record in conference.
An impressive aspect of the victory for the Trojans definitely came with the improvement of the Trojans’ defensive play after last week’s loss to UCLA. The Trojans had 13 blocks to the Waves’ 5.
With extra time off, the Trojans had more practices during the week, practicing four times rather than the usual one or two.
“We really got the chance to work on our all-around game” said senior middle blocker and co-captain Steven Shandrick when asked about the victory. “We worked on our serving and passing a lot, and it really showed in the game.”
Redshirt junior outside hitter Steven Mochalski led the team with 14 kills, and the Trojan offense hit at an impressive .333 clip, a drastic improvement after hitting a season-low .103 against UCLA last week.
Freshman setter Micah Christenson also had one of his most impressive performances of the season, having a .521 assisting percentage to go along with leading the Trojans with 7 digs.
Junior outside hitter Maddison McKibbin made his season debut after being sidelined in the preseason with an ankle sprain, and filled in with four blocks for sophomore opposite Tanner Jansen, who was out for the third set after spraining his ankle.
Getting back on the right track after a demoralizing loss at home was crucial for the Trojans, and Shandrick emphasized this after the game, stating “The Pepperdine was a must-win game for us. We were all hungry to win, and we showed that if we put in the work in practice, then the results will show in the game.”
The team’s next game comes on Thursday against the NAIA squad Hope International, which is sure to be a welcome break from conference play.
 
I thought Micah played very well.  Happy to see MOchalski have a super game.
come out and support these great athletes
Great game Trojans.  Nice to see Madison back on the court. I smell a  long win streak coming for Trojan Volley.

Three consecutive road matches against three top-ranked teams could not deter the USC men’s tennis team from its undefeated start to the spring dual match season.
Aces · Senior Daniel Nguyen and the Trojans are 7-0 this season. They are currently on a 26-match winning streak that extends back to February 2011. USC has won three national championships in a row. - Mannat Saini | Daily Trojan
No. 1 USC extended its record to 7-0 after a 6-1 victory over the No. 12 Pepperdine Waves (3-3) in Malibu on Friday. The clash against the Waves comes after road wins over No. 6 Stanford and No. 13 California last week and precedes the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in Virginia next weekend.
After the Trojans narrowly escaped with the doubles point against the Waves, USC garnered the victory with five consecutive singles wins, all in straight sets.
USC sophomore Ray Sarmiento, ranked No. 12, took down No. 49 Mousheg Hovhannisyan 7-5, 6-1 to give the Trojans a 4-0 advantage and to guarantee USC’s seventh win of the season.
Before Sarmiento’s clincher, senior Steve Johnson gave USC its first singles point with a 6-3, 6-2 win over No. 21 junior Sebastian Fanselow, followed by a 6-4, 6-3 decision by No. 33 freshman Yannick Hanfmann over No. 106 senior Hugh Clarke.
“[Clarke] was serving and volleying, and I hit good returns so I got him out of his game,” Hanfmann said.
USC sophomore Emilio Gomez, ranked No. 48, and freshman Roberto Quiroz finished off their opponents to round out the final points for USC and earn their sixth and ninth consecutive singles wins, respectively.
Pepperdine scored its sole point off No. 35 Finn Tearney’s 6-3, 7-6 (5) upset over No. 16 senior Daniel Nguyen, which came after the Trojans had pulled ahead 6-0.
Prior to USC’s singles wins, both sides battled for nearly an hour and a half in doubles action.
Each squad took a doubles win, setting up a battle for the doubles point between USC’s Johnson and Hanfmann and Pepperdine’s Tearney and Alex Llompart.
“We knew it was going to be on us to clinch it,” Hanfmann said. “We had some close games until the tiebreak. It was really tight but really good.”
Looking poised to notch their fourth straight doubles win, the USC pair quickly pulled ahead to a 5-2 lead.
A late rally by the Pepperdine pair, however, forced the match into a tiebreaker, which Johnson and Hanfmann escaped to finalize a 9-8 (7-1) victory and USC’s first point of the match.
“We let it slip, but once it got to the tiebreaker, we really fought together,” Johnson said. “It was good to see Yannick and I forget about the opportunity we had at the beginning and focus on the task at hand.”
After a week of rest, the Trojans will take their 26-match winning streak to Virginia and will participate in the National Team Indoor Championships, which pits 16 of the best teams in the nation in a four-day tournament from Feb. 17 to Feb. 20.
“Every match is a stepping stone to get better, and we’re getting hot at the right time,” Johnson said. “I think we’re in a really good position to make a good run in Indoors.”

The USC women’s golf team, fresh off three top-10 finishes in the fall, kicks off its spring schedule Monday with the 2012 Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge.

The three-day tournament, held at the Palos Verdes Golf Club, will feature 16 teams, including Pac-12 rivals UCLA and Oregon. The Women of Troy are the two-time defending champions of the tournament, winning individually in 1999 and 2006, and also capturing the 2008 Pac-10 title on the course.
The team returns five golfers from the 2011 squad, which won four tournaments, including the 2011 Pac-10 Championship and the 2011 West NCAA Regional. The Women of Troy have been a consistent force in recent years, as evidenced by their top-five finishes in each of the last six years, and seven of the last nine.
The Trojans are led by All-Americans senior Lisa McCloskey and sophomore Sophia Popov. The spring season is especially critical for Popov, whose productivity in the fall was hampered by a wrist injury that kept her out of the season-ending SEC/Pac-12. Popov rose to prominence as a freshman, garnering both National and Pac-10 Freshman of the Year honors while leading the Trojans to yet another strong finish.
The team also returns junior Cyna Rodriguez, a 2010-11 All-Pac-10 honorable mention and regular starter last year, as well as senior Inah Park and sophomore Rachel Morris (2011 All-NCAA West Region), both of whom registered multiple starts. Additionally, the team features freshman Kristen Park, the nation’s top women’s recruit and Doris Chen, a leading recruit and former U.S. Girls’ junior champion.
USC is anchored by coach Andrea Gaston, who is in her 16th year at the helm of the squad. Last year proved to be an especially successful year for Gaston, who was named National Golf Coaches Association National Coach of the Year for the second time, leading USC to four tournament victories.
Though the Women of Troy were unable to replicate their dominance from the previous year, the fall season marked a trend of improvement. After starting slowly and finishing eighth at the 2011 Fall Preview in September, the team bounced back to finish in sixth place at October’s Stanford Intercollegiate tournament, which is even more impressive considering Popov’s wrist injury early in the second round of play. This was followed by an even stronger performance at the Pac-12 Challenge in November, where the Women of Troy tied for fourth — despite fielding four starters.
“Our fab four have something in which they can be very proud,” Gaston said. “It was a big-time field, so this was a darn good performance to have low round of the day. It was a difficult and long course that required a lot of patience on the greens.”
McCloskey provided the team’s most consistent effort, recording three top 10 finishes, including a mark of seventh at the Pac-12 Challenge to conclude the fall campaign.
Following this tournament, the Trojans will have two weeks off before participating in the Allstate Sugar Bowl in New Orleans Feb. 26-28.
Hope to see u all at Palos Verdes Golf Club to support this wonderful team.

Frank Cruz was sitting in his office overlooking the first base line at Dedeaux Field, squeezing a weathered, beaten up baseball in his right hand.
“I’m quietly optimistic,” the Trojans’ second-year coach said of his team’s upcoming season, which begins Friday at home against Jacksonville University.
He also knows he has every reason not to be.
USC’s once-proud baseball program, which boasts an NCAA-best 12 national championships, has fallen on hard times in recent years. Since 2006, the team has posted a combined 138-145 mark. Its last winning season came in 2005 — a year in which it made the NCAA Super Regionals under then-coach Mike Gillespie.
In short, it has been exceptionally average.
“We should be a team that gets into regionals year in and year out,” Cruz said. “When you’re not in a regional, it should be the abnormal year.”
But missing the postseason altogether has become increasingly normal for USC. Its last winning season was seven years ago. The Chad Kreuter era proved to be rather tumultuous and short-lived.
But things are supposed to be different now.
You can tell Cruz wants to buck the trend and to turn things around. He cares about USC baseball in a way that only older generations of fans and alumni can understand. He remembers the wins. He remembers when the program, under Rod Dedeaux, won eight NCAA titles in the 1970s and five in a row from 1970 to 1975.
He was an assistant for the Trojans from 1993-1996, when they compiled 169 wins and earned a trip to the College World Series in 1995.
So naturally, he wants to see USC revert to its winning ways.
“What we’re trying to do is obviously convince these guys that … they can win and they can compete,” Cruz said. “I’m just trying to get them to understand the significance of being on this campus.”
Though football has long been the school’s most widely recognized sport, baseball has been just as decorated. Cruz understands that.
But reversing recent results is a steep challenge in today’s culture, considering private schools like USC are at a serious disadvantage. Currently, Division I college baseball programs are allotted 11.7 scholarships to be distributed in any way they wish.
Though there isn’t exact information as to how USC is splitting up its scholarships, considering this season’s opening day roster holds 39 players, it’s reasonable to assume that many players are paying a considerable amount of money in tuition.
It certainly isn’t chump change. Tuition at USC annually costs around $42,000. By comparison, nearby schools, such as UCLA and Cal State Fullerton cost about $14,000 and $7,000, respectively, for in-state residents.
Four private schools — Miami, Pepperdine, Rice and USC — in the last 20 years have won the College World Series.
It’s a formidable challenge.
But it also hasn’t helped that under Kreuter, a significant portion of the Trojans’ recruiting classes opted to sign with major league teams as opposed to enrolling in school. That, more than anything, has hampered the program.
“You got to recruit guys that are going to come to school, not recruit guys that are going to sign,” Cruz said. “That’s what has, in my opinion, ultimately been the Achilles’ heel at USC.”
And that starts by recruiting players who are academically oriented, according to Cruz. Recruit players who might not be selected in rounds one or two of the annual MLB draft. Recruit players whose parents went to college.
Even last year, the Trojans missed out on two of their top signees in third baseman Travis Harrison and shortstop Christian Lopez, who inked deals with professional clubs worth $1.1 million and $800,000, respectively.
But for now at least, Cruz will have to make do with a roster mixed with fifth-year seniors and inexperienced underclassmen. It’s a roster that is hardly perfect, but it’s a group that appears as if it can compete in a rugged Pac-12.
It has pitching. Friday starter senior Andrew Triggs, who was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 21st round, returns to school one year after posting a 3.67 ERA in more than 90 innings, as does 6-foot-8 fellow senior and Saturday starter Ben Mount.
There isn’t a ton of power and offensive prowess outside senior right fielder Alex Sherrod, who posted a team-leading slugging percentage of .486 a season ago.
But it’s disciplined and smart. It’s not everything but it’s something.
“You’ve got to win,” Cruz said. “That’s all there is to it. You got to win. This place has everything you need to be successful: great facility, great resources.”
Will the Trojans win in 2012? Nobody really knows.
But at the very least, it’s almost springtime, when they say hope rises, just like the sap in the trees.

Scoreless in overtime and down seven with a minute and a half remaining, the Women of Troy needed something extraordinary to walk away with their first victory in Haas Pavilion since 2005.
Team effort · Though Cal took momentum into overtime by hitting a shot at the end of regulation, it was the Women of Troy who stuck together to win. Freshman Ariya Crook led USC to victory with 11 points in overtime. - Corey Marquetti | Daily Trojan
USC freshman Ariya Crook made it happen.
The guard erased the deficit by scoring all of USC’s 11 overtime points in the final 92 seconds, including the go-ahead layup with five ticks remaining to give USC (13-11, 7-6) a 76-75 overtime road victory over California (18-7, 9-4).
USC began overtime missing five consecutive shots and promptly fell behind 65-72. With senior guard Ashley Corral sidelined by an ankle injury in the fourth, Crook stepped up and caught fire, hitting five straight baskets for 11 of her career-high 21 points.
“With two minutes to go, we all had this look on our face, like ‘we couldn’t do this,’” Crook said. “But our coach believed in us and told us to keep fighting and to keep pushing.”
Down one in the final minute, USC forced a turnover off an offensive foul by Cal guard Layshia Clarendon with 18 seconds remaining, which set up Crook for the winning basket.
“I’m playing for the team,” Crook said. “With [Corral] out, I just thought I had to step up.”
The Golden Bears had a chance to hit their second buzzer-beating 3-pointer of the game, but Cal guard guard Lindsay Sherbert could not convert, leaving the crowd stunned with Cal’s first home loss in Pac-12 play this season.
Before the overtime battle, Clarendon hit a desperate 3-pointer over three USC defenders as time expired, sending Cal fans into a frenzy and forcing the extra five-minute period.
USC was up four with 23 seconds left in regulation following two free throws by senior guard Briana Gilbreath
But a layup by Cal guard Brittany Boyd and a missed free throw by Crook gave Clarendon the opportunity for her heroics.
“[Coach Michael Cooper] just told us to keep our minds on the win,” Gilbreath said. “He never got down. He was excited, and he kept our minds right and focused.”
Crook did not make a field goal until she hit a jumper with 3:15 left in regulation, but still finished with 21 points on 8-for-12 shooting.
Gilbreath led the Women of Troy in scoring with a game-high 24 points to go with eight rebounds.
USC junior forward Christina Marinacci pulled down 13 rebounds, surpassed only by Cal’s Gennifer Brandon, who had 17 boards alongside her team-high 22 points.
The teams traded leads 11 times, with neither side pulling ahead by more than seven points through the entire contest.
“It feels so good to finally pull out a close game. We always had heart, and we always believed that we were going to win the game,” Gilbreath said.
This was the Women of Troy’s second win of the season over the Golden Bears, who are second in the Pac-12 behind No. 4 Stanford.
USC defeated Cal 74-54 on New Year’s Eve for their first conference win.
With the victory, the Women of Troy ended a two-game skid and avoided falling into a tie for seventh in the conference. They have a 6-6 record in the Pac-12.
“We really focused in and honed in our schemes. Everything just flowed correctly for us tonight,” Gilbreath said. “We really needed this win.”
USC will return home for three straight games at the Galen Center, with the first against UCLA (12-11, 7-5) on Sunday at noon.

Not many parking signs in Los Angeles bear the words “Death Customers Only.”
But it’s only fitting considering the realm said “death customer” will enter. Once you come face to face with a giant skull, you’re only steps away from entering Hollywood’s Museum of Death.
Be warned: This isn’t a Universal Studios tour bus stop where you’ll see the theatricality of expertly placed fake blood and deliciously thrilling fictional gore. This is death at its most chilling — at its most human and real.
Owners and married couple JD Healy and Catherine Shultz’s Museum of Death first came to life in San Diego in 1995 before migrating to the city of angels and finding a permanent home surrounded by everything from a Thai restaurant with a man singing Elvis tunes to the Kodak Theatre.
If you stumble upon the museum by chance or are afraid to enter, you can sneak a peek at their test photo, a gory snapshot of a dead man on the road. The museum might not focus on scaring you, but there are plenty of shocking pieces.
“Absolutely we put shock stuff. We live in a society where shock is the only thing that catches your attention,” Shultz said. “At some point hopefully someone takes something away from it.”
You take everything at your own pace without a cheesy film noir tour guide at your side. In fact, the people of the Museum of Death are warm and welcoming, and though the museum’s material might seem depressing, Healy sees some of them as cautionary and even uplifting.
She recalled one night when a red-eyed girl came in and admitted that she wanted a pick-me-up and she was seeking it in the museum. Shultz sees a similar healing power in the exhibits.
“If I’m having a bad day, I can take a minute and go in a room and take it in,” said Shultz. “My life is so great. You see enough death, you’re happy to be alive.”
The museum is organized into rooms starting with the Serial Killer Archives. The materials in the room let you get into the brains of serial killers by seeing artwork from killers like cannibal Nico Claux and rapist John Wayne Gacy. From there, the material gets more and more frightening and difficult to look at, such as a set of photographs from beheadings of the 1930s and 1940s in China.
The Mortician and Funeral Room contains instruments for embalming along with a detailed video, a point where many people have passed out or, as the Museum Museum of Death puts it, had a “falling down ovation.” The photographs are equally shocking: In one, a pair of hands removes a brain from a person’s skull.
Employee Erek Michael decided to work for the museum because he appreciated the experience the exhibits create for museum visitors.
“It’s a factual look at death,” Michael said. “People are coming in off the street and immersing themselves in an environment, confronted by a topic that is usually considered taboo or normally you wouldn’t consider confronting on a daily basis.”
Other rooms highlight famous cases like Charles Manson and the Black Dahlia murder. A small room with a window recreates a scene from the Heaven’s Gate cult mass suicide. The room reveals two bodies in bunk beds and some of the materials displayed — from the bunk beds themselves to the clothes. These items came to the hands of the museum from an auction in San Diego.
The museum doesn’t limit itself to humans, though. Another room dedicates its space to animals that underwent taxidermy, from a group of albino animals to a few anomalous creatures. If you look hard enough, you can find a couple of animals with too many limbs.
By the end of your visit, you will have taken in a lot concerning life and death. Some visitors will walk out angered, but Shultz’s intentions prove the museum isn’t meant to scare, anger or depress anyone that walks through the doors.
“When people come in, I ask ‘Hey where are you from?’ and I immediately think of the best death of that area,” Shultz said. “I’m trying to make people comfortable with their mortality. I’m trying to make a connection. I don’t have a connection with them, but death does.”
When you leave the museum, whoever is at the front desk will bid you farewell with the phrase “Have a great life.” It sums up the attitude of the museum perfectly.
As Shultz puts it, “We’re all gonna die, get used to it and live your life.”
 
The Museum of Death is located on 6031 Hollywood Blvd.

What do you get when you combine Shakespeare, MFA actors and a little theater on the edge of campus?
A very entertaining MFA Repertory Theatre production of The Tempest at the Scene Dock Theatre.
Theatrical throwback · The Tempest pays tribute to one of literature’s finest by fully embodying the comedic spirit of the Shakespearean play. Despite the play’s minimalist set, it proves to be an overall success. - Photo courtesy of Craig Schwartz
The production is a fairly faithful interpretation of the original Shakespearean text, although a few anachronistic lines are thrown in for comedic effect, such as the line “swing and a miss,” uttered by the kooky Stephano (Pete Ploszek), arguably the play’s most entertaining character.
Of course, seeing a faithful adaptation of Shakespeare means that audience members should be familiar with the plot beforehand, as the play could otherwise be difficult to follow.
The Tempest, takes place on an island and revolves around Prospero (David Zurak), the ruler of the island, and his daughter Miranda (Shirley Norman).
Prospero was once in line to be the Duke of Milan, but was usurped and cast away to the island, which he then took over from Caliban (Curtis Scott). With the help of his magical slave Ariel (Lindsay Weisberg), Prospero — trying to avenge his honor — causes a great storm to shipwreck a boat full of the people who usurped him.
The production’s simple set design by Takeshi Kata makes the most of its resources, using only a moving bed and a projector to convey these magical happenings.
The bed is placed in the middle of the stage and a screen on the far side which is utilized to display the storm and other imagery that would have been much more difficult to show live.
Given the simple setting and the supernatural nature of this play, The Tempest can be a bit confusing at first.
The moving bed is somewhat off-putting as it switches hands between characters: sometimes it is unclear what the bed is supposed to be or where the island begins and ends onstage. The theater itself, however, is small and production value was presumably limited, so these issues are understandable.
And in spite of whatever narrative confusion it may cause, the moving bed is clever and provides an interesting mobile element as it continues to change places on the stage.
The cast of The Tempest cause the play to really pop and at times fall flat, creating a binary that both aids and injures the production.
The play begins at a slow pace but hits the gas as soon as Weisberg comes on stage as the fiery fairy Ariel. From that point on, The Tempest gathers momentum and improves as more supporting characters are introduced to the story.
The stronger actors are notable because they energize the story as soon as they step on stage.
The biggest standout of the show is Ploszek, who plays up his comedic abilities and sex appeal in outrageous ways, as the drunken castaway Stephano. In one particular scene, he uses a bottle of wine to simulate oral sex with Caliban.
Even when the Shakespearean text becomes overly complicated and the dialogue harder to comprehend, Ploszek still seems able to make any member of the audience laugh at his will.
Additionally, Katherine Grabau plays a delightfully goofy jester, Trinculo — in drag, on top of it all.
The scenes with Stephano and Trinculo are by far the most entertaining and captivating moments of the production.
The Tempest makes for an entertaining night of theater, even if the complex nature of Shakespeare’s texts means that one might get lost in the dialogue and narrative.
Those passionate about Shakespeare, and theater fans in general, will enjoy this show. Affordable tickets only make it that much more appealing as a cheap night of merriment. Here, USC’s MFA program proves it can really put on a show — one with wildly entertaining supporting cast members.
 
The Tempest is running at the University Park Campus Scene Dock Theatre through March 3. See the USC Arts and Events calendar for more information.
