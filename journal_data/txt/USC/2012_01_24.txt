Queer Worldmaking, one of three exhibits of Cruising the Archive: Queer Art and Culture in Los Angeles, 1945-1980, opened Tuesday in the Treasure Room on the first floor of Doheny Memorial Library.

The exhibition is the largest collaboration between USC Libraries and the ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives since the archives became part of USC in 2010. It is the Libraries’ first collaboration with the Getty’s Pacific Standard Time art initiative.
ONE Archives Art Collection Curator David Frantz co-curated the three exhibits. He said they wanted to highlight the diversity of the archives, especially with Queer Worldmaking.
“[The exhibit shows] materials from 1945 to the ’80s, so it represents the full historical scope of the exhibition,” Frantz said. “We were interested in presenting materials that are not just LGBTQ activism in Los Angeles, but bits and pieces of tangential interesting stories and objects in ONE’s collection.”
The exhibit in Doheny includes a sampling of early queer newsletters and magazines, personal photos, clothing and masks and other historical artifacts. The other exhibits include about 65 works of art.
“It’s not just books and photographs, but all these artifacts, that tell a story,” Executive Director of Communications and Public Programming Hugh McHarg said. “We want all the people, especially our students, to know that we have these resources and the best way for us to do that is to show them off.”
Vincent Vigil, director of the LGBT Resource Center, said students can learn about the legacy and history of the LGBTQ community from the exhibits.
“It’s important for college youth to understand that movement has been going on for a very long time and to understand that history,” Vigil said.
McHarg said a variety of academic programs use the ONE Archives, including English, sociology, history and journalism, but displaying the archives helps show students what the library has to offer.
“All of the research collection is part of USC Libraries,” McHarg said. “It’s this really broad historic collection that has everything from pulp fiction of the ’50s to photographs of entertainment figures and personal journals of gay activists.”
He also said the objects, while sometimes difficult to store and maintain, are items one can only access through the university.
“Preserving objects that aren’t books or flat objects does present something of a challenge,” McHarg said. “It takes space and it takes time, but they’re very valuable and unique pieces of history that are particularly useful for the academic community at USC.”
Tyson Gaskill, executive director of planning and communications for USC Libraries, said having small exhibits in the library gives students a chance to learn something new outside of the classroom.
“We shine a light on areas that people may know just a little about but not very much. We try to give people a wider viewpoint,” Gaskill said. “That goes for the entirety of our exhibition program. We don’t like to just scratch the surface, we like to dig in to certain areas and bring things to light and contextualize it.”
The other two Cruising the Archive exhibits, Rare Looks and Wink Wink, are displayed at the ONE Archives at 909 West Adams Blvd. and the ONE Archives Gallery & Museum at 626 N. Robertson Blvd. in West Hollywood.

Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce recently released Hard Times, a report on the link between college majors, unemployment rates and earnings, concluding that not all college degrees create equal opportunities after graduation.
Though recent college graduates have a 9 percent unemployment rate, the study found some majors offer considerably better employment prospects than others.
Statistics from recent college graduates show education, health care, business and professional services industries yield the lowest unemployment rates, whereas unemployment is highest in architecture, humanities and liberal arts majors.
Carl Martellino, executive director and associate dean of the Career Center, said this study does not change the way the Career Center advises students because the economy is always changing.
“The economy goes up and down, and each [major] gets its turn,” Martellino said. “That statement regarding high unemployment rates for architecture majors may change a year from now, so it’s hard to pick one major and look at economy at one point in time.”
Martellino said students’ anxieties about job security is not new, and the important thing for students to focus on now is getting job experience as soon as possible through internships.
“What is important are internships, where students take their experience from the classroom and gain writing, analytical and critical thinking skills,” Martellino said.
Lori Shreve Blake, director of Alumni Career Services, said this information should not change what students should consider when choosing their major, although it should encourage them to further research their interests.
“For students struggling with their major, we [first] ask what their interests are and then give them information and research guides to look into different industries,” Blake said.
Blake suggests Hoover’s Online Vault, which provides detailed descriptions of corporations. Students can access it through ConnectSC, the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Outlook Handbook and USC’s net dictionary.
“Students need to research the profession and talk to the alumni who are in those jobs, and the Trojan Network database has more than 8,000 alumni who are willing to talk with students about careers,” Blake said.
Some students, however, still feel anxiety about entering the job market after graduation.
Myrna Ayoub, a senior majoring in architecture, which has a 13.9 percent unemployment rate, credits USC with teaching her technical skills and helping her get internships every summer. On the other hand, she said she is not sure if she will be employed when she leaves college.
“I feel prepared, but the economy is not prepared to take all of us,” Ayoub said. “We have all the tools, but there aren’t enough jobs to support everyone coming out.”
Vidal Woods, a freshman majoring in international relations, which has a 4.8 percent unemployment rate, said he worries about whether he will get a job that is high-paying enough after graduation.
“USC offers plenty of opportunities to students for internships and connections with people in the work force,” Woods said. “What I would be worried about is salary — not will I get a job, but will I make enough money to survive on my own.”
Other students said they are confident about with their ability to get a job given their choice of major.
Catherine Barth, a sophomore majoring in kinesiology, which has a 1.8 percent unemployment rate, said she chose her major because health workers are always needed, and she feels secure because USC has connections with local hospitals.
“As a pre-health major, I feel really secure,” Barth said. “The reason why I chose USC was because it is so connected with this area in [Los Angeles], such as the Los Angeles Hospital.”
Barth said she thinks she will have job opportunities when she graduates.
“USC has prepared me coming out of college with job opportunities and connections,” Barth said. “USC has the most competitive programs in the nation and going out into the real world, students are recognized for being a pre-med major at USC — employers recognize the name.”
Despite the new information regarding majors, Blake said employers are now looking to hire more than ever, and they are coming to USC to seek future employees.
“The economy is getting better and USC is the university of choice for many companies,” Blake said. “Companies come unsolicited to us and they come for one reason: because we are USC.”

President Barack Obama called for economic equality in his third State of the Union speech to a joint-session of Congress Tuesday night.
More than 150 people watched Obama’s address at an event hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics in the Annenberg East Lobby.
Poltical talk · The Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics held a live screening of President Obama’s State of the Union address on Tuesday. - Matthew Wunderlich | Daily Trojan
“We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by,” Obama said. “Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules.”
Kaya Masler, president of USC Students for Barack Obama, said Obama’s speech was directed toward lawmakers and the electorate.
“He spoke to voters and he spoke to Congress,” Masler said.
Speaking about higher education, the president urged Congress to prevent interest rates on student loans from doubling in July. Obama also said he would cut federal funding to schools that do not work to lower tuition costs for students.
“If you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down,” Obama said. “Higher education can’t be a luxury — it’s an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.”
Some students were supportive of Obama’s initiatives but expressed doubts about whether they would make it through a Republican-controlled Congress.
“I was surprised he took such a hard tack on China,” said Kyle Hall, a junior majoring in international relations and political science. “I liked a lot of the tacks he takes, but I’m not sure he’ll pass them.”
Other initiatives Obama proposed were the creation of a Financial Crimes Unit and the implementation of a tax-reform proposal known as the Buffett rule. Named for investor Warren Buffett, who reported that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary, the rule states that millionaires pay no less than 30 percent in federal income taxes.
“Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households,” Obama said. Maurae Baker, a sophomore majoring in public relations, said she agrees with Obama on the Buffett rule.
“It doesn’t make any sense that someone making one million [dollars] doesn’t pay [the same rate] as their secretary,” Baker said.
The speech and a screening of the Republican rebuttal by Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels were followed by a panel discussion sponsored by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.
The Biffet rule is jus tpolitic-speak for ” i’m running for Psident and need more votes, so I’ m going to pand to the polulace that doesn’t understand financial investing and how an investor’s money gets taxed.  Generally speaking, millionaires work hard, have investment income and contribute to the tax burden much more so than Obama stated last night.  Investment income is the largest category of income for millionaires, and that income is tqxed 2x.  Once at the corporate level and again at the personal level.  Why should that dollar of incomoe be taxed twice, let alone at 30%?  Obama knows better than that, ,but most American’s don’t.    I just thought that if he’s going to grqndstand and tell the American people that he has all these grand ideas, what about telling us how he plans to fund them, and reduce this huge monolithic deficit he has created?  It is a known fact that approximately 47% of the American people do not pay any federal income taxes.  Probably the same for the states.  So, if you want to raise tax revenue, why make us pay more when you can xhange the tax to make everyone “pay their fair share” with a flat tax rate?  Except for those in a predetermined poverty level of income, paying a flat tax, without any deductions, would simplify everyone’s life, generate revenues, reduce government bureacracy, reduce the size of the IRS, and provide a stornger income sream to support medicare, SS, etc.
We all want to see this country come back to the presperous years we once had, but if Obama says that everyone should pay their fair sharee, then aet forth a fair tax policy, not promote more of the same…..  Why should I pay 30% when someone working a lower income job only pays 15%?

Lane Kiffin didn’t win a conference championship or make an appearance in his first BCS bowl game as a head coach in 2011, but he did just about everything else in his second year as head football coach at USC.
And now Kiffin will officially have some hardware to remember the 2011 football season by.
Top of his game · Kiffin has been at USC for parts of eight seasons. He has an 18-7 record. - Carlo Acenas | Daily Trojan
Earlier this week, the Los Angeles Sports Council named the 36-year-old the 2011 Coach of the Year recipient as part of their seventh-annual L.A. Sports Awards. Kiffin beat out a cavalcade of star-studded coaches, including 11-time NBA champion Phil Jackson, MLS Cup winner Bruce Arena and 2002 World Series champion Mike Scioscia. Arena, Jackson and Scioscia each took home the award from 2008-2010.
Despite another year of postseason sanctions, Kiffin led a Trojans’ squad that finished No. 6 in the final AP Poll atop the Pac-12 South Division regular season standings with a 10-2 record, including big wins against No. 4 Oregon and Notre Dame on the road and UCLA in the season finale.
Under Kiffin’s guidance in 2011, the USC football program produced three first-team All-Americans, seven Pac-12 first teamers, the Pac-12 Morris Trophy winner, the Pac-12 Offensive and Defensive Freshmen of the Year and five members of the Freshmen All-American first team. They are widely expected to compete for the Pac-12 title and national title next season.
During his two-year tenure at Troy, Kiffin has amassed an 18-7 (.720) record. Only Howard Jones and John Robinson had more wins in their first two seasons at USC. He was previously the head coach at Tennessee and served as a member of USC’s staff from 2001-2006.
Kiffin will be honored at the L.A. Sports Awards ceremony on March 15 at Club Nokia at L.A. Live.
Other Trojans who have previously been recognized at the L.A. Sports Awards include Allyson Felix (2007 and 2009), Lisa Leslie (2006) and Matt Leinart (2005).

Though last weekend will likely be remembered for the loss of an icon in college football, Joe Paterno’s passing is not the only one worth mourning for Southern Californians.
Legendary · Loel Schrader started following USC athletics in 1966. He died Wednesday at 87. - Sports Information Department
Loel Schrader never won a national championship, or any game for that matter, at the collegiate level, but in some ways his career as a sports journalist had as much influence when it came to shaping the narrative of college football as any coach or player has ever had.
When the 87-year-old writer died from pneumonia last Wednesday night at a hospital in Westminster, there were no candlelight vigils or long lines of people outside his house seeking to memorialize his lasting legacy.
Schrader’s career covering the USC athletic program began in 1966, in the midst of the John McKay era. As the beat writer for the Long Beach Press-Telegram, there was no secret that his work might have been overlooked by the region’s readership because it lacked the brand recognition of the Los Angeles Times.
Whether it was pacing the sidelines at Howard Jones and Brian Kennedy Field or in the Coliseum tunnel, Schrader became notorious for always finding a way to track down McKay. He was a reporter’s reporter.
He didn’t work for the paycheck or the glamour of covering USC football. He worked so that readers could wake up the next morning  and feel as if they were on the sidelines of the previous day’s game.
“By late in my junior year at Gahr High in Cerritos, I knew I wanted to be a sports writer someday, in very large part because I wondered, `How cool must it be to have a job like Loel Schrader?’” Press-Telegram writer Frank Burleson said last week. “Other writers and columnists would regurgitate quotes from coaches and players, and recount all the keys from the field or court of action. ”
In addition to his work as a beat writer, Schrader’s popularity grew thanks in large part to the columns he began writing in 1977. A former amateur boxer himself, Schrader treated his subjects with care, humility and, most importantly, fairness.
Schrader’s reputation was built not only on his reporting skills and thought-provoking subject matter, but his ability to carefully plot out his words in a manner that made the stories come to life.
My only contact with Schrader — if you can even call it that— before his passing, occurred during a football practice three years ago.
I didn’t walk up to him, shake his hand or thank him for what he’s meant to the sports journalism profession. After all, I was just a timid, aspiring journalist without the faintest idea of what it truly meant to love what you do in life.
But I should have. Looking back on that afternoon, his wide-eyed smile and passion for the game said everything I needed to know.
And months later when I sat down and read the book he co-authored with Steve Bisheff titled Fight On!, his love for sports, journalism and this university jumped off the page.
Schrader wasn’t just a journalist covering USC athletics, he was a journalist who was a fan of all things USC athletics. Unlike most of the reporters in the industry, however, he didn’t let his fan-based biases dictate his work. If anything, his love for the cardinal and gold fueled a career that was second-to-none when it came to professionalism.
Each word, each paragraph, each story wasn’t just another assignment, it was a true and pure labor of love.Bisheff recalled that as his health worsened over the past few months, Schrader’s final wish was to live long enough to see another season of Trojan football. And, though he will not physically be present to watch Matt Barkley and company as they strive to win a ticket to Miami next January, his presence, whether on the sidelines of the practice field, the Coliseum press box, in the memories of those who had the privilege to meet him or read his work will unquestionably live on.
Loel Schrader was a writer, a father, a grandfather, a colleague, a friend, but also more than that; for those of us who one day wish to walk in his footsteps, he is a constant reminder that sports can be more than just a game.
It can be the intrinsic good we all search for in life.

On the night of Dec. 22, 2011, the 6,431 fans at the Galen Center witnessed Dewayne Dedmon’s arguably worst performance this season.
The 7-foot redshirt sophomore forward was ineffective. He was nearly scoreless — save for a layup with six minutes remaining in the game. He finished with twice as many fouls (four) as he had rebounds (two). In the end, the Trojans stumbled against then-No. 11 Kansas, 63-47, which marked their fourth loss in five games.
Understanding the game · Sophomore redshirt forward Dewayne Dedmon has only been playing organized basketball for a couple of years. The seven-footer is averaging just over five and a half points and eight rebounds. per game. - Chris Pham | Daily Trojan
“This guy never played in high school,” USC men’s basketball coach Kevin O’Neill said of Dedmon, whose first season of organized basketball didn’t come until he reached the age of 18. “He played one year of junior college, which is the equivalent of high school with ashtrays. He’s a developing young guy.”
Developing might be the most fitting description for Dedmon who, since 2008, hasn’t played many more than 100 games of organized basketball when adding up one year of high school, junior college and 20 games with USC.
The Lancaster, Calif., native never played for an AAU team as most players who suit up for major Division I college basketball programs nowadays do. He never played for a local parks and recreation team, either.
Under the instruction of his mother, a Jehovah’s Witness, he was prohibited from playing any organized sports. Though Jehovah’s Witnesses are not explicitly forbidden from doing so, some parents discourage their children from playing organized sports, fearful they might show allegiance to the team, not Jehovah, or more commonly known as God.
So like other followers of the faith, the tall, athletic Dedmon never played for a sports team while growing up in Southern California. He was limited to a ball, a handful of friends and local parks with a basketball hoop. He didn’t play until he was a senior at Lancaster High School, where he saw limited action on the court — scoring just two total points all season.
—
Dedmon’s experience prior to arriving at USC in January 2011 would not normally garner any added attention. After all, following just one year of high school basketball, he enrolled at nearby Antelope Valley College in fall 2008, where he promptly grayshirted to focus on fundamentals to make up for lost time.
Grayshirting, unlike redshirting, postpones the start of a player’s Division 1 eligibility, by delaying his enrollment as a full-time student and pushing back his eligibility clock, which gives the player five years to play four seasons. This is why Dedmon is listed as a redshirt sophomore and has two full seasons of eligibility remaining beyond 2012 despite being in college for four years.
The plan was devised by Antelope Valley College’s head coach Dieter Horton, who now serves as an assistant on O’Neill’s staff at USC. The goal was to provide the lanky forward with a crash course on basketball in the hope of making up for all the years without coaching or instruction. In essence, Horton saw it as a chance for Dedmon to practice.
“The big thing was [that] we had to be patient,” Horton said. “[We] had to go very slowly to develop him, and it was all big picture stuff.”
Then, as a freshman in his second year at AVC, Dedmon still posted pedestrian numbers, averaging 6.6 points and 7.8 rebounds per game — nothing that would forecast instant college basketball stardom.
“He was raw,” Horton said. “He was this gangly, 6-foot-8-and-a-half kid who really didn’t understand how to play. And his body didn’t really understand itself.”
At 18, upon his high school graduation, Dedmon measured about 6-foot-8 and 190 pounds. But in a span of three years, he grew four inches and gained more than 50 pounds, which caused O’Neill to take a chance on the local prospect, offering him a scholarship in the fall of 2009.
—
It wasn’t until last summer when Dedmon landed on the radar of most NBA scouts.
In an interview with ESPN.com senior writer Andy Katz in late July, O’Neill didn’t mince words when asked about the potential of his young big man.
“He’s 7-foot, 250 and he runs like a deer,” O’Neill said. “There’s no question he’s a first-round pick.”
The third-year coach, at the time, also publicly noted the possibility that Dedmon could even bypass his final two seasons of eligibility at USC by declaring for the 2012 NBA draft — something that on the surface appeared far-fetched considering his inexperience.
Nonetheless, expectations escalated. In November Sports Illustrated published a 7,000-word profile of Dedmon as part of its college basketball preview issue. Hordes of scouts began attending practices at the Galen Center to watch the 7-footer partake in workouts and drills.
The Trojans had recently witnessed the departure of another big man in Nikola Vucevic, who was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the No. 16 overall pick in June’s draft. But with Dedmon in the lineup, most were not anticipating much of a drop-off.
The attention proved to be a lot for Dedmon to handle.
“I definitely felt a little pressure,” he admitted. “I felt like everybody had their eye on me. And I’m not really one for the spotlight.”
Injuries, however, made things more complicated.
During an Oct. 11 practice, the right-handed Dedmon suffered a non-displaced fracture on his shooting hand — just above the knuckle of his index finger, an injury that forced him to wear a splint until Nov. 9 — just two days before the Trojans’ season opener at home against Cal State Northridge.
In a matter of weeks, he suffered another setback, a stress injury to his right foot on Nov. 28.
Though the injury would sideline him for only one game, a 56-35 victory for USC at UC Riverside on Nov. 30, it would stunt his development — at least somewhat.
“I’m still learning the game,” Dedmon said. “Those injuries slowed down my learning process and what I could take in. If I didn’t have the injuries, where I’m at right now could have been earlier.”
—
Determining where Dedmon is right now is slightly complicated.
On the surface, it appears as if Dedmon hasn’t lived up to O’Neill’s lofty praise. Through 20 games, he is averaging 7.9 points per game and ranks 17th in the Pac-12 in rebounds with 5.6 per game despite his 7-foot frame. Neither exactly indicates that becoming a first-round draft pick is on the immediate horizon.
“I want him to be an NBA player,” O’Neill said. “He wants to be an NBA player. The whole problem was everyone, including him, thought it might be this year and it’s not. He’s getting some valuable lessons on being a first-year player.”
The popular NBA mock draft website NBADraft.net projects Dedmon as the No. 49 pick in the 2013 NBA draft. DraftExpress.com, another widely cited site, does not have him being selected in either the 2012 or 2013 draft.
But the glimpses are there, though they occur less frequently than many would have hoped for back in October.
Against the Matadors in the opener, Dedmon grabbed a pass from sophomore guard Maurice Jones on the low block, swooped through the air to the right side of the basket and slammed the ball through the rim. It was the display of athleticism many had only heard about.
More recently, Dedmon scored a career-high 18 points Thursday against Oregon, which is in second in the Pac-12 with a 15-5 overall mark.
He appears to have finally found a comfort zone after months of attention, largely centering on the potential of becoming the Trojans’ third lottery pick in the last five years.
But the hype and talk about becoming a first-round pick seems to have faded for now.
“It definitely took a toll on me at the beginning of the year,” Dedmon said. “I learned to just deal with it. Right now, I don’t even think about any of that stuff.”
Right now, he is still developing.
His coach has conceded as much.
“He’s getting better,” O’Neill said. “He’s going to end up being a guy that plays for money someday, but it’s not this year.”
Only time will tell.
Hang in there.  You are in the right place at the right time and the team knows it is lucky to have you playing with them.  The rewards for the Trojans are in the mix and on their way.

Mauro Remiddi, also known  as Porcelain Raft, is reinventing modern music.
This Italian indie musician makes his debut with his album Strange Weekend, an eclectic,  nouveau, shoegaze record.
Prior to this album, Mauro Remiddi explored a spectrum of opportunities available to musicians. He scored for Italian short films and performed in one-man bands. Remiddi’s last notable project was London-based indie psychedelic band Sunny Day Sets Fire.

Though his debut album might be slightly comparable to his former band, Remiddi’s latest work is unique and admirable with its incredibly full sound. He uses synths, guitars and drums to great effect, creating some songs that recall the exuberance of synth-pop darlings Passion Pit and others that evoke the darker, earthier tones of Grizzly Bear.
Along with this full sound, Remiddi incorporates lo-fi, a musical genre popularized by singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens, which is characterized by the acceptance and encouragement of technical flaws, such as background noise, distortion and humming.
Instead of rejecting these flaws, Remiddi embraces them and weaves them into his musical style, delicately balancing the distortion and music. In addition to his experimental style, Remiddi’s husky voice and dreamy sound quality — combined with catchy hooks and intriguing lyrics — make the album an easy, enjoyable listen.
The album begins with the M83-esque, psychedelic track “Drifting In and Out.” The song is complex and skillfully layered with mellow beats, dark synths and Remiddi’s dynamic voice. The track is not the standout song of the record but is a good way to present Porcelain Raft’s aesthetic to its audience.
“Shapeless & Gone,” a pop-oriented, less electronically heavy tune, follows.  A languorous guitar and Remiddi’s soaring vocals take center stage under the consistent hum of a subtler synth. The song likens Remiddi to a young Thom Yorke and establishes the unique sound of Porcelain Raft — mellow, lo-fi pop characterized by an understated synth, nostalgic guitar and wide-ranging vocals.
The next two tracks, “Is It Too Deep for You?” and “Put Me to Sleep,” are less pop and more shoegaze. The beat and synths have a darkness and urgency that contrast with Remiddi’s dreamy, emotive vocals. Remiddi seems to speak, however, rather than sing against a very danceable beat on “Put Me to Sleep.”
In contrast, the surprisingly simple and sweet ballad “Backwords” follows suit, featuring Remiddi’s emotional and expressive vocals accompanied by a melancholy and imploring guitar. This is as stripped down as Remiddi gets on the album, and it is a welcome change that shows his wide range of musical sensibilities. Though this track is extremely different from the rest of the album, it is easily one of the most memorable.
Another standout on the record, one that is sure to be widely successful in the festival circuit, is the more upbeat, danceable anthem “Unless You Speak From Your Heart.”
Remiddi reminds the song’s subject that he doesn’t wanna listen / Unless you speak from your heart. The refrain from this chorus is infectious and devastatingly honest.
The album begins to wrap up with the slower and gloomier tracks, “The End of Silence” and “If You Have a Wish.” Remiddi’s vocals and guitar take the backseat to distortions, which make these songs easy to gloss over, especially when trailing behind the prior showstopper.
The final two tracks “Picture” and “The Way In” contain traditional, folk-infused vibes, drawing listeners in with their beautiful simplicity. The easy guitar and airy vocals recall the surf-pop vibe of Jason Schwartzmann’s California collective Coconut Records.
Specifically, “Picture” begins with the requisite lonely, folksy guitar but leads in to a more symphonic sound with elements of electronica as the song progresses. “The Way In,” on the other hand, features a gloomier, more distorted guitar with more baritone vocals. The lyrics on this song are significantly more introspective, as Remiddi ruminates on the power of dreams and the stark heartbreak of loneliness, serving as some of the best of the album and a perfect way to close.
Often, indie bands can sound like rehashes of each other; nevertheless, Remiddi’s Porcelain Raft has found a unique sound full of potential for more refined future projects.
Remiddi manages to mix a pop awareness with atmospheric musicality, which can only become more striking and sophisticated with time. Most importantly, each track on this album is worth listening the whole way through as each is unique in its own right, and that is a rarity these days.

Some books span 900 pages, involve vocabulary that only rocket scientists would use and read like more convoluted versions of War and Peace.
Then there are books like Lunatics.
Riotous read · Barry and Zweibel’s novel ventures into the chaotic, petty fight of two grown men, all in good spirit and hilarious humor. - Photo courtesy of Penguin Group
The new novel from comedians Dave Barry and Alan Zweibel is a work that flaunts an incredibly brisk pace, hitting you with jokes page after page,  without room to take a breath.
In fact, Lunatics is so fast-paced that each chapter barely takes up four pages, and this relentless torrent of action keeps you on the edge of your seat like a thriller — but with all the triviality of a comedy.
Lunatics centers around two men living in Northern New Jersey, one Philip Horkman and one Jeffrey Peckerman. Philip, who owns a pet store called “The Wine Shop,” ends up getting into a massive fight with Jeffrey, a “forensic plumber,” over a kids-league soccer game that Philip refereed.
Though it might sound like a piece of unnecessary drivel, true hilarity ensues when their fight escalates to epic proportions.
After an unfortunate situation involving a lemur from Philip’s store, the two men get mistaken for terrorists: Cue hackneyed bonding moments as the two attempt to clear their name while running from the cops.
The novel takes some time to get invested in, as the protagonists are not exactly likable. Philip, supposedly the “nice one,” can come off as weak and annoying, while the rude antics of Jeffrey make you wonder why, in this case, murder is illegal.
As time goes on, however, the grating behavior of the two somehow grows on the reader, and Philip and Jeffrey transform from annoying strangers into the two weird uncles everyone laughs at during the holidays.
Lunatics is told in the first person, with Jeffrey and Philip’s perspectives alternating between chapters — a clever move, as the reader gets to hear both sides of the story without getting sick of either character. Right when you feel yourself getting angry with one of Jeffrey’s racist comments, for instance, the book’s narrative conveniently flips to Philip.
With any other writers, Lunatics would be, well, a little loony. But in the hands of Barry, a Pulitzer Prize winner, and Zweibel, a Saturday Night Live veteran, readers will find themselves genuinely enjoying the crazy ride of two schmucks from the Garden State.
The jokes are so matter-of-fact that confusion seems impossible. The writing is clear, allowing for even the most elementary readers to follow along. And though it is difficult in some novels to know how a piece of dialogue is supposed to be delivered, the intended meanings come across clearly in Lunatics.
After all, when a line is written as “PUT DOWN THAT LEMUR!!” one shouldn’t have a problem understanding the anger of the character.
For better or for worse, the two protagonists are two of the most immature fictional characters to grace literature’s presence in quite some time. Jeffrey holds a grudge against Philip for disqualifying his daughter’s soccer shot. Philip drives by Jeffrey’s house to try and steal back his lemur. There’s even a car chase on the George Washington Bridge.
For some, the immaturity of these two middle-aged men will be exhausting. For others, it will be refreshing. Then again, many middle-aged men are not as dapper and civilized as George Clooney.
Perhaps that is the point Barry and Zweibel are attempting to make with Lunatics: No one ever truly grows up. If that’s the case, the authors succeed here.
Though the novel features realistic portrayals of people, Lunatics is not for everyone. Along with the immaturity of the characters, the humor can be juvenile — the work reeks of the slapstick comedy Saturday Night Live used to be known for.
Lunatics manages to harken back to a different period of comedy, where “funny” could be genuinely lowbrow without risk of condemnation. The book is a classic tale of mistaken identities and silly travels and features an ending that seems wildly ridiculous yet somehow perfect for the characters.
Though Lunatics might not be the most sophisticated of novels, it certainly does entertain — and though the journey might be insane, the destination is a satisfying result.

Jewelry, iPods, that new key-lime flavored gum. The best things come in small packages.
Joining those esteemed ranks is the small plates menu, evidenced in the food industry’s growing appreciation for it. Los Angeles is proudly participating in the trend.
Small plates, referring to small portions of food served with much variety, first entered American culture as an adoption of foreign food. Restaurants like the much-lauded Playa, serving traditional Latin tapas, appeared around the city.
Then, love began pouring in for various Middle Eastern restaurants serving meze-style food prepared with yogurt, lemon, olive and parsley flavors.
Other restaurants followed suit, grounded not in ethnic roots but in new American flavors. Lazy Ox Canteen, in Little Tokyo, maintains a long chalkboard list of vegetable small plates that includes caramelized cauliflower with chili and mint. There’s also grilled cabbage — an underrated version of the leafy vegetable. With a reasonably priced lunchtime menu, there’s no excuse to ignore your greens.
Small plates are also a fun option at home. Spanish croquetas, essentially “loaded” mashed potatoes — pork, beans, cheese and all — fried into a ball and dipped in a creamy red pepper sauce, make for great hits at dinner parties. The texture, at once crispy and gooey, is one reason for praise.
Planning a menu for my own small plates party, I thought of a version of my own croquetas — the traditionally Jewish salmon ones that I used to beg my grandmother to make. These croquettes are different from the loaded mashed potato croquetas, but the comfort-food factor is the same.
Throwing together an evening of small plates at home is much easier than you would probably think. For instance, you might have noticed the baby artichokes in the markets lately.
With a circumference no larger than that of a golf ball, they are meant to be enjoyed as small bites. Clean them, salt them, steam them and you quickly have a wonderful addition to your menu.
And the most innovative chefs know presentation can elevate a great meal. Look at José Andrés at The Bazaar, where he serves little steak-and-cheese buns on monkey figurines.
As you’ll likely find yourself without simian serving ware, you can use a variety of other items waiting for clever usage. If you’re looking to get unconventional, start with soup in a shot glass.
Some foods are best enjoyed as just a single taste. After thoroughly rinsing the glasses of errant vodka, fill them with a spicy avocado soup — puréed avocado with coconut milk and chilis. A whole bowl of the soup might overwhelm the palette — serrano pepper can pack an awfully powerful punch — but throwing back a quick sip gently warms up your taste buds.
Chilled soups like this one are often the simplest to make, usually requiring no cooking of the ingredients. Gazpacho, with refreshing tomato and generous chunks of cucumber, is another great option.
People often discuss the act — and the art — of eating as a journey. This is especially true concerning the act of eating small plates in which, over the course of a single meal, you can travel to the seas of the Mediterranean, a tiny noodle shop in Seoul and a Northern Californian farm.
That’s possible at a restaurant like Beverly Hills’ Erbe Matte, where you can enjoy small plates of clam-and-tomato soup, Korean sweet-potato noodles and beet-and-apple salad.
And as a means of portion control, the small plate style is a smart strategy to embrace. On top of that, the small plate style especially encourages a communal experience that can make merely good eating great.
These dishes are meant to be shared, and shared generously. After all, while our plates are shrinking, our appetites are not.

The Grey is not a feel-good movie.
It will chill you to the bone, bring tears to your eyes and evoke fear that you never thought  was possible.
Wolf pack · The Grey, a survivor thriller, follows a group of plane crash victims who land in a deserted area of Alaska. Little to their knowledge, a group of hungry and threatened wolves are waiting to attack. - Photo courtesy of Kimberley French
Despite all this, it is one of the most powerful and provocative films to date because it exposes human beings at their most corroded state — one that is rarely experienced in everyday life.
Directed by the brilliant Joe Carnahan, The Grey tells the story of an unruly group of oil-rig roughnecks who survive a plane crash in the remote Alaskan wilderness. While already battling glacial temperatures and the traumatic aftermath of the crash that killed dozens of fellow flyers, they find themselves the victims of a ruthless pack of monstrous wolves whose territory they have invaded.
Liam Neeson masterfully assumes the role of Ottway, the group’s de facto leader because of his position on the rig as the wolf lookout. Ottway  contends with an internal battle of his own as he, facing excruciating loneliness after losing his wife, contemplated suicide on the eve of the plane crash.
In a drastic turnaround from his hopelessness and despair of the night before, Ottway must summon every ounce of strength and courage to rally the seven surviving men around their common goal: survival.
The wolves, which have a colossal stature making them seem more mythical than real, commence their attacks immediately, devouring one of the men on their very first night. The creatures are smart and vindictive, picking the men off one by one and attacking when the men are at their most vulnerable state.
Frozen and hunted, the dwindling survivors are forced to search deep within themselves for the strength and will to persevere, which is undoubtedly the most shining aspect of the film — the erosion of humanity in each of the men, demonstrated by superb acting performances.
Neeson’s performance as the tormented Ottway is undoubtedly the show-stealer. In the film, Neeson’s character makes daring choices and is forced to set aside his internal struggles to lead the men in the face of death.  Neeson, a seasoned veteran in powerful, masculine roles (Taken, Michael Collins), brings every ounce of strength and command that we have come to expect from his past performances. He even adds an unexpected and welcome dose of sensitivity that surfaces in brief flashbacks of him with his wife.
Though Neeson’s exceptional performance truly commands the film, the actors portraying the other survivors gave remarkable performances as well.
Frank Grillo shines as Diaz, the young, brash spitfire whose bad attitude and rebellious behavior pose a serious threat to the teamwork and cooperation of the group — something paramount to their survival.
Grillo’s performance is particularly impressive because of the well-defined arc his character undergoes. Initially a churlish, bratty punk refusing to admit his own fear and insecurity, Diaz is forced to re-evaluate everything he has ever believed in and to face life with brutal honesty.
Grillo brings a truthfulness and ease to the character that makes the gradual exposure of his deepest fears and desires a truly haunting phenomenon to witness.
Though the plot is relatively simple, the ever-changing relationships and dynamics between the men and the wolves, who truly are characters themselves, are more than sufficient to drive the story and  to engage the audience from start to finish.
The tension is palpable throughout the entire film, not allowing the audience to relax in the slightest, even during moments that are apparently calm.
The cinematography is masterful, capturing the grisly conditions of their surroundings and the sense of barren hopelessness in a way that will make the viewer shiver, even in the warm comfort of the movie theater.
All in all, The Grey is a terrifying, teeth-gritting action-packed thriller. It will have you on the edge of your seat in anticipation, forcing you to deeply examine humanity, faith, fear and the transient nature of life — a rare accomplishment in the genre of action thrillers.

East Los Angeles is in a conundrum. For the past half-century, the residents of the unincorporated area have tried to make it an official city within L.A. county. Incorporation would give East L.A. freedom to develop and advance.
Many other Angelenos, however, claim that incorporation is not economically viable.
The Local Agency Formation Commission plans to meet Wednesday to decide whether to reject the decision to make East L.A. a city or to postpone the vote. The area has been stagnant for too long for the commission to postpone the vote again.
As residents of Los Angeles, USC students should appreciate what is at stake. East L.A. might not be our side of the city, but it is close. And though our campus is an oasis, it is important to understand there is still much improvement to be made in neighboring areas.
Many people are wary of leaving East L.A. to its own devices so soon. This fear is understandable: A study performed for the commission said that East L.A. would not be able to sustain itself after three years.
But we should not see haste as an issue. The issue is erring too much on the side of caution and condemning East L.A. to a cycle of perpetual postponements.
Advocates of incorporation have noted that the report is shortsighted and pessimistic. They say the report was overly liberal in projecting how many new expenditures the newly incorporated city would require and overly conservative in estimating how much revenue the city could produce. Moreover, advocates add that without being in charge of its own future, the area’s potential for growth is significantly stunted.
Home to more than 126,000 residents, East L.A. thrives with political activism, art, music and food. Though it lacks adequate economic growth, there is definite potential for development.
Incorporation is the riskier proposition, but it would afford the area room to progress, room it doesn’t have in its current situation.

Have you ever noticed those popping, crackling sounds while watching a film at your local movie theater? Those aren’t the sounds of the popcorn at the concession stand; those are the sounds of 35mm film projection.
Jonathan Zhang | Daily Trojan
35mm film, the film gauge used most often for projecting motion pictures, has been a major part of film history since the beginning of the 20th century. But in the 21st century — a time dominated by technological advances — 35mm film projection is in great danger of becoming extinct.
Julia Marchese, an employee at The New Beverly Cinema, said she “received a letter at the theater from one of the major studios announcing that they were stopping production of 35mm prints in 2012.”
As a university in the heart of Los Angeles, USC is known for having one of the most prestigious film schools in the country. Many film professors on campus make a point of showing films in beautiful 35mm print. Without 35mm, film students would learn about film history solely from textbooks. What would become of our film classes?
Of course, it is faster and cheaper to store, maintain and distribute digital prints of movies, but what is new and convenient isn’t always what is best. 35mm film should continue to be preserved and made available to movie theaters everywhere.  We call movies “films” for a reason. Film — literally, the thin strips of plastic — allowed the first motion pictures to come to life.
In the age of the iPhone, the Blu-ray player and the HD TV, historical treasures are seldom viewed as sacred. “Out with the old and in with the new” has increasingly become a common motto. But what if what you love most is on the verge of becoming obsolete?
Many people still collect vinyl records and VHS tapes. People, like myself, stand in lines that stretch around the block at revival houses and grindhouse theaters for the same reason: to experience entertainment from another era.
Liking 35mm film isn’t a sign of being behind the times. Yes, I own an iPhone and a Blu-ray player, and I’m an active user of Netflix. Still, I refuse to forget what started it all: the good, old-fashioned film reel. Every pop in the soundtrack and every cigarette burn in the corner of the picture serve as reminders of what first got us excited about watching moving pictures.
“There’s naturalness to film,” said Michael Breiburg, former film editor of Crave Online. “It provides one less layer between the audience and the reality of the movie. Sometimes the natural tool is best. While many try to recreate it, and come close, sometimes it can’t be topped.”
The loss of 35mm film could cause revival movie houses and grindhouse theaters to lose long-time customers and business. Historic landmarks in the Los Angeles area, such as LACMA, Laemmle Theater, American Cinematheque, Nuart and The New Beverly Cinema, have all been dedicated to screening films strictly in 35mm for many years.
Matt Sheehan, a senior majoring in animation and digital arts, described his own love of 35mm film.
“I used to work at the Laemmle Theater and to see a projector shoot light onto a big screen, to see a movie the way the filmmaker saw the movie — there’s something to be said,” Sheehan said.
These theaters could get the proper equipment for screening digital “prints,” but as Sheehan said, “something would get lost along the way.” When loyal patrons sit in their seats, they expect to experience film in 35mm.
If major studios took away 35mm film as part of its transition to digital prints, many film titles would not see the silver screen again for years to come. Remember when we were all anxiously waiting for our favorite movies to be transferred from VHS to DVD? Now, we are enduring that same wait for our favorite movies to be upgraded to Blu-ray. But with every conversion, some classic films are lost.
Since learning of the digital takeover, Marchese has started an online petition through ThePetitionSite.com to save 35mm film. Help her fight for film by signing her petition. Write a letter to your favorite film studio. Show your respect for the movies.

Last week, I talked about a very current film and video trend—time lapse. This week, we’ll examine a technique that’s hundreds of years old.
When shooting a video or a film, or even taking photography, a lot of technical advice is thrown around.  Some good basics to start with are always shoot in the direction of the light (not against it), be aware of what you can hear (because it will be in your shot), and hold the camera steady or use a tripod.  One of the most commonly references “rules”—and the subject of today’s post—is the rule of thirds.
The rule of thirds is a visual guideline used to create aesthetically pleasing photos.  Essentially, imagine your frame (a rectangle) is divided into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, creating nine boxes.  When framing a shot or photo, the most important visual element of the frame should be placed along the intersection of a horizontal and vertical line.  Also, compositional elements—such as a horizon line—should be placed along one of the horizontal thirds.
The rule of thirds is mentioned all the time, in various visual mediums.  If you’re having trouble visualizing this rule, simply Google “rule of thirds” and some great images will pop up.
And the rule of thirds isn’t a rule for no reason—there seems to be some truth to it.  A straight-away, perfectly centered shot of a windmill, for example, can suddenly become much more interesting when applying the rule of thirds.  Use the rule of thirds in all of your photos and video—even just snapping a quick picture of a friend or a sunset—and many times your amateur photos and video will suddenly look professional.

Visions and Voices rocked students at Bovard auditorium  last Thursday night with a concert reading of Tom Stoppard’s Rock ‘n’ Roll. The play is above all historical, examining protest movements in England and Czechoslovakia in the second half of the twentieth century, but (as you might expect based on its title) Rock ‘n’ Roll is about music, too. Indeed Stoppard is centrally arguing here that between 1968 and 1990, music and politics became irremediably interrelated. Music from the period reflects the societies’ attitudes, but also, by the same token, political progress in Europe would not have been possible without buffeting by popular music.
What follows is a list of the songs featured in Rock ‘n’ Roll, each cued by Tom Stoppard in the play’s text, and altogether comprising a delicious sampler of great music. Of perhaps especial note to those who attended the performance on Thursday: Syd Barrett’s “Golden Hair,” which opens the play and then continually asserts itself as a motif; Pink Floyd’s “Vera” (which itself alludes to Vera Lynn’s “We’ll Meet Again”), underlining the characters’ fondness for the past even as they revolt against old ways; and the Rolling Stone’s “You Got Me Rocking,” whose performance at the end of the play trumpets the victory of freedom over tyranny, of relentlessly rule-bending rock and roll over the stifling Soviet Union.
