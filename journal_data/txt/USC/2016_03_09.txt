“I’ve been working down here as a volunteer since I was 14 years old, and 30 years later it doesn’t look better. It looks worse.”
Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti’s words carry across a packed crowd gathered on Jan. 28 in the Los Angeles Mission, a nonprofit organization that serves the homeless residents of Skid Row. He acknowledges that homelessness in Los Angeles is a more pressing problem than ever before. At the same time, he praises the city government for stepping up and taking action, from funding outreach programs to hiring case workers.
And yet, outside the gates of the L.A. Mission where Garcetti speaks, tents on the sidewalk go up as 2,500 people prepare to spend tonight — like every other night — on the streets.

Over the past year, Los Angeles has grown to contain the nation’s largest chronically homeless population and experienced the country’s greatest spike in homelessness. While the rest of the country saw homeless populations flatline — and several major cities reduced their figures — Los Angeles outpaced New York’s chronic homelessness increase 3 to 1.

In response, lawmakers ushered in a series of actions targeting homelessness in 2016. On Jan. 4, California Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin de León and a group of state senators announced a $2 billion legislative package to build affordable housing for mentally ill and chronically homeless individuals.
Los Angeles’ homeless population did not appear overnight. Research shows that a combination of factors including mental illness, unemployment and skyrocketing rents drove the city to a point where the government had to take action. Garcetti’s words came just days after the announcement of new government initiatives to “find a way to get [people] off the street,” no matter the cost.
The recent moves on the part of government bodies, however, have left researchers, organizers and others working in the field wondering why the issue was allowed to expand until it reached a breaking point. Ultimately, many question whether these initiatives will truly address the underlying causes of homelessness among thousands of people for whom Los Angeles is not a home but a vacant spot where a home should be.
Skimming the surface
In the past few years, Los Angeles has tried to keep up with the growing needs of its homeless residents. Numerous nonprofits and government organizations work to house people living without shelter and provide food and medical services to the city’s homeless population. In 1993, the city even established a specific government bureau — the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority — and provided it with an annual budget of $70 million.
The problem is that these services aren’t working. The combined efforts of public, private and nonprofit organizations have failed to reduce homelessness in the past year and have in fact allowed it to reach a point where one out of every 253 people in the city lacks permanent housing.

According to John Kelly, the outreach coordinator for the L.A. Mission, the issue was not that the government didn’t take action in recent years, but that the solutions it pursued were not effective. He explained that current government systems prioritize those labeled “chronically homeless,” who have lived without permanent housing for at least one year.
Eighty percent of the people on Skid Row don’t meet this criteria, Kelly said. This means that the chance of helping someone through early intervention and preventing chronic homelessness in the first place is lost.
“If I have someone who has just lost their employment, or someone that’s in between jobs, they’re not eligible for me to house or help,” Kelly said. “Why do people have to get to the point where they’re chronically homeless before they can get help?”
As a result, the overall number of homeless individuals has grown even as the government has devoted extra resources to housing and other forms of assistance. Channeling resources into avenues that don’t actually work to solve homelessness, according to Kelly, has neglected more important areas like the need for increased funding for homeless families.
“Nobody wants to treat that situation,” Kelly said. “The money is in single-room occupancy housing, not housing for families. You can’t have kids in those places, and most women who need them still have family ties.”
Out of 12 shelters for battered women in Los Angeles, according to Kelly, eight were not refunded this year. Because these shelters house women and children who are often fleeing domestic violence and would otherwise become homeless, closing them down adds to the number of people living without permanent housing. And in the future, homeless children are more likely to live on the streets than to be placed in a housing program, becoming the next generation of homeless adults as time goes on.
Seth Kurzban, a clinical associate professor at the USC School of Social Work, agrees that the city has misused its resources. However, he believes that the spike in homelessness ties back to the inadequate treatment of mental illness in the homeless community.
Kurzban has been working to increase social integration for homeless individuals with severe mental illness since 1996. That task, Kurzban said, is crucial because this group makes up only one-third of the homeless population but requires 75 percent of the resources available.
“People dealing with a serious mental illness need far more of those services and take up far more of those resources,” Kurzban said. “Helping that population helps the entire homeless population because then those resources that get concentrated in this one segment can be redistributed across the entire swath of homelessness.”

An unanswered question
John Kelly understands the struggle to allocate resources better than most.
Kelly spent 17 years on Skid Row, moving in and out of temporary housing while struggling with drug addiction. When he first became homeless after losing his job working for the city of Los Angeles, Kelly had hope that he would soon find permanent housing or employment through a government program. But as time went on, no one reached out to help him get off the streets for good.
Instead, Kelly said, what government services there were only enabled his drug addiction. And what started out as a temporary setback turned into a decades-long experience with chronic homelessness.
“You can be on drugs and not realize how long you’ve been on them,” Kelly said. “If it’s convenient, like it was here, years can pass.”
In November 2015, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development reported that 12,536 people in Los Angeles County were chronically homeless, living without permanent housing for at least a year. These figures mark a 55 percent increase since 2013 and rise to 40,000 people when counting everyone who is currently homeless, no matter how long they have been on the streets.
Kelly is among those who believe that drug addiction is the primary cause of the increase in homelessness. As the L.A. Mission’s outreach coordinator, he has helped more than 200 people on Skid Row overcome their addictions and find permanent housing over the past six years. Many of the people he works with, however, continue using even if they are offered a place to live.
“We’re definitely not winning the war on drugs,” Kelly said. “And you will never be able to reduce the homeless count without addressing drugs — it goes hand-in-hand.”
Data from the Community Epidemiology Work Group shows that in 2013, 16.6 percent of all people admitted for drug abuse treatment were homeless at the time of admission. In comparison, homeless individuals formed only 0.39 percent of the overall population. And with an increase in the use of drugs such as heroin — emergency visits for which rose 68 percent between 2005 and 2013 — more people are finding themselves in the same situation as the people Kelly assists.
According to Kelly, however, most of the funding and services aimed at ending homelessness are enabling the problem instead. The push from governments and nonprofit organizations has been to target the mentally ill, but Kelly believes that providing access to prescription pills leads to a lack of incentive to stop using and get off the streets.
“People can come down here and live with functional drug behavior, where it’s supported,” Kelly said. “[Los Angeles is] the best choice for homeless people because we have the best homeless system in the world.”
Benjamin Henwood, however, sees a lack of affordable housing, and not drug addiction, as the biggest driving force behind homelessness in Los Angeles. Henwood, an assistant professor at the USC School of Social Work, pointed out that with a vacancy rate of less than 3 percent, the housing that Los Angeles offers simply can’t accommodate the people that live there.
As a result, Henwood said, rising prices unfairly discriminate against those at the lower end of the socioeconomic spectrum.
“Traditionally, we have approached homelessness as an issue that happens to an individual because of their choices, and in order to correct that and get out of it, people need to address their issues,” Henwood said. “Because of that, we’ve designed a system where we expected people to go into treatment settings, and if they were successful, we would help them get housing. But what people really need is a place to stay — a home.”
A study by the Furman Center found that while rents went up 11 percent between 2006 and 2013, wages fell by 4 percent over the same time period. The resulting gap meant that fewer people were able to afford the rising cost of living in Los Angeles, an issue that Henwood says is central to understanding homelessness in the city.
“Los Angeles is an extreme example of income inequality and wealth disparity,” Henwood said. “There are houses being sold for $100 million in Los Angeles County, at the same time as the government announced that it would spend $100 million to address the problem of homelessness that affects 44,000 people. These disparities are problematic.”

For Kenn Stokes, a volunteer at the L.A. Mission who’s worked with homeless individuals for 11 years, the economic gap Henwood described has only grown worse in recent years.
After the 2008 recession, Stokes saw the number of guests at the L.A. Mission increase drastically.
“We were packed because people found themselves losing their homes and were out on the streets,” Stokes said. “They didn’t have resources like family members or other agencies.”
This lack of resources, Stokes said, exacerbated the problem of chronic homelessness in particular. Year after year, he saw the same individuals returning to the L.A. Mission, as skyrocketing rents drove them onto the streets and a shortage of permanent, affordable housing kept them there.
And when the government did step up, it channeled its resources into temporary solutions that stemmed the flow of temporary homelessness, but left the underlying problems unsolved.
Searching for solutions
The solutions enacted by the city and county governments worked, for a while, because they addressed a temporary need. Los Angeles County saw its chronically homeless population drop 65 percent between 2005 and 2013 after the construction of temporary housing and increased funding for mental health services got large numbers of people off the streets.
It wasn’t until 2015’s 55 percent increase in chronic homelessness that legislators realized these temporary solutions couldn’t support long-term change.
The state government also plans to invest $200 million over four years to provide shorter-term supportive housing while permanent housing is constructed elsewhere.
Three days later, Los Angeles County officials released a comprehensive Homeless Initiative, which contained 47 strategies for combatting homelessness.
These are divided into six categories: preventing homelessness, subsidizing housing costs, increasing income, providing case management and services, creating a coordinated system and increasing affordable housing.
The plan has an estimated cost of $149.7 million and was approved by the County Board of Supervisors on Feb. 9. The first of its three phases will implement about a dozen of the Homeless Initiative strategies by June 30, while Phase 2 will take place in the second half of 2016 and Phase 3 will begin in 2017.
L.A. City Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson, who serves as co-chair of the city’s homelessness and poverty committee, believes that these steps address a critical need.
“To combat this crisis, we need to create a citywide strategic plan to ameliorate the multitude of issues affecting our Angelenos living on the streets,” Harris-Dawson wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan. “We need to increase financial stability and job opportunities as well as providing better integration of services throughout the City and County to ensure people have the support they need to get back onto their feet.”
Others, however, see the initiatives as a starting point rather than a comprehensive solution. Among these is Jeremy Sidell, the chief development and communications officer for PATH, a shelter and outreach organization dedicated to finding permanent housing for homeless individuals and families.
“We’ve seen a lot of positive change in terms of much greater involvement on the party of local, city and county governments,” Sidell said. “But the only way to end homelessness is to put people in homes. So until we’re able to solve the crisis around affordable housing and to commit to moving people who are currently living on the streets, we’ll continue to be challenged by homelessness in our community.”
Tent city · Every night, thousands of people set up tents on the sidewalk to seek temporary shelter from the elements, such as below this freeway overpass on 39th Street. Government programs attempting to address homelessness have channeled resources into supporting single-room occupancy housing, which has left many women and children without homes.Hawken Miller | Daily Trojan
One such solution, according to Henwood, may be Housing First, a national model for addressing homelessness that has been used successfully in several major U.S. cities, and most recently was able to reduce chronic homelessness in the state of Utah.
Housing First, Henwood explained, reverses the traditional approach toward homelessness. Instead of waiting until people have gone through rehabilitation programs to provide them with housing, Housing First starts with placing people in permanent homes.
As a result, they can feel free to pursue the activities that will lift them out of the cycle of homelessness, such as getting a job or seeking mental health counseling.
“If you think about what your life is like day-to-day, I think most of us take for granted that we wake up in the same place every morning and that we have a refrigerator where we can get food,” Henwood said. “They’re pretty mundane things, but if you lack any of those, it’s really hard to concentrate on getting to work on time or following through with an appointment when you’re worried about where to get your next meal.”
The initiative has been adopted by several major organizations, including Sidell’s PATH and projects such as Home For Good. However, Los Angeles as a city hasn’t made Housing First its official policy and hasn’t made any indications that it plans to in the future.
This refusal to act makes Henwood and others feel like the recent string of government initiatives won’t create comprehensive change, despite their multi-billion dollar price tag.
An issue of attitude
For some researchers, solving homelessness isn’t about the money at all.
Kurzban believes that many of the issues behind government approaches toward homelessness result from an attitude that punishes people for being homeless instead of helping them.
“Not much has changed since [I started working in] 1996,” Kurzban said. “People still approach the homeless as ‘the unworthy poor’ — we want them to prove that they are ready to get resources, and that really exacerbates the number of people living on the street. We are still operating on a system that works piece by piece, and as a result has not addressed the greater need.”
Stokes agrees that individual mindsets about homelessness color official policy. But he sees a way to change those attitudes by recognizing the mutual humanity that exists between those who have permanent housing and those who don’t.
“These people are not a lost cause,” Stokes said. “And they think that society has given up on them, but sometimes people deserve a second and third and fourth chance.”
For the people that set up their tents outside the L.A. Mission every night, that chance could mean the difference between having a hot meal and going hungry. Many who haven’t been homeless for very long are optimistic that the government will help them receive mental health treatment, drug counseling, employment or housing. Those who have spent years on the streets are less hopeful.
Maybe some of them hear Garcetti’s speech as it filters through the gates that bar them from entering the L.A. Mission outside of designated meal times. But even if they do, few think it will make a difference — what does $100 million mean to someone who can’t afford to pay that month’s rent?
Instead, 2,500 residents of Skid Row unfold their poles and spread out their tarps as the sun goes down.

The Trojan family mourned the loss of a leader on Sunday night. Former provost Elizabeth Garrett was serving as the president of Cornell University when she passed away from complications of colon cancer. She was 52.
Garrett was a leader at USC for over 11 years and served as provost for five. During her time at USC, she was lauded for making an incredible impact as an educator, administrator and friend.
“So many of us recall her remarkable energy, her tenacious commitment to her work and her deep passion for our community,” Nikias said in a statement. “Beth worked tirelessly on our behalf, and her accomplishments will continue to benefit the Trojan family for generations.”
A native of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Garrett earned her bachelor’s degree from the University of Oklahoma and her law degree from the University of Virginia. After law school, she worked as a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and Judge Stephen Williams on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. Garrett also worked as the legislative director and tax and budget counsel for Oklahoma Sen. David Boren.
Garrett was deeply admired by those she worked with on the Hill. In 1988, she was listed in a law magazine as one of the year’s hottest new hires for private practice law. The distinction came as no surprise to those who knew her well.
“If I were to count on the fingers of one hand the people I’ve known with the most remarkable intellect, she would be on that list,” Boren said.
Foregoing what was predicted to be a highly successful career in law, Garrett chose to pursue academia. She began her work as a professor at the University of Chicago in 1995, and toured as a visiting professor at institutions such as Harvard Law.
In 2003, Garrett moved to Los Angeles to join USC. For seven years, she served as a professor of law and as vice provost for one year. In 2010, she became provost and senior vice president for Academic Affairs. As provost, Garrett recruited administrators, expanded the strength and diversity of undergraduate classes and expanded the University’s residential and online professional master’s degrees.
She also played a key role in other efforts to improve the University, such as expanding the University’s postdoctoral programs and programming new academic buildings. Also a celebrated author, Garret published more than 50 articles, book chapters and essays, and her casebook on legislation and statutory interpretation is considered one of the most influential works of its kind.
“USC was exceptionally fortunate to have Beth Garrett as our Provost,” said Stephen Gruber, the director of the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center and a close friend of Garrett’s. “She brought our University to new heights, with even greater aspirations. [She] was a visionary.”
After a long tenure at USC, Garrett accepted an offer in 2014 to become the first female president of Cornell University. The achievement earned national attention, as Garrett became the fourth sitting female president in the eight Ivy League universities. Garrett herself noted the achievement as another important step forward in gender equality in academia.
“It certainly is not a battle that has been won,” Garrett said. “But it is a battle that we’re winning.”
Only months after taking her position, however, Garrett announced in early February that she had been diagnosed with colon cancer. She began aggressive treatment immediately at Weill Cornell Medicine, and was released following surgery on Feb. 19. In the wake of her death, Cornell created a research fund for colon cancer.
“It is a tragedy that Beth’s life was cut short so soon,” said Laurie Glimcher, the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medical College. “It’s also a painful reminder of why we’re all here — to advance medical research and offer patients the best care, so that they can achieve their dreams and live as fully as possible.”
At USC, Garrett’s loss is just as personal as it is professional. Fellow professors and administrators remember her fondly for her passion for supporting everyone her life, from students to coworkers to friends.
“I will miss her friendship,” Gruber said. “Beth took the time to write handwritten notes. Beth cared and asked about my family. She set high standards for herself and others, while graciously helping bring out the best in people. That’s a friend.”
Garrett is survived by her husband, Andrei Marmor, who remains a professor at Cornell’s law school.
Man, that’s some cold s***. She just got the provost job at Cornell and then she’s taken off  the earth. I love to see women in power and them using that power in righteous ways. May Mrs. Garrett rest in peace.

The Office for Diversity and Strategic Initiatives held the third Campus Climate Open Forum on Wednesday which focused on the issues of space and funding for cultural resource centers. 
The Forum, titled “Funding, Space and Student Centers,” was moderated by George Sanchez, the vice dean for diversity and strategic initiatives, and featured Vice President for Student Affairs Dr. Ainsley Carry, Rosalind Conerly, assistant director for the Center for Black Cultural and Student Affairs, and Mary Ho, the assistant vice dean of diversity and strategic initiatives. They discussed their takes on the need for the improvement of existing student centers and the installation of new ones.
Sanchez opened the discussion and said that the purpose of the forum is to create a safe space to talk about campus climate.
“What we’ve tried to do is create both a safe space, so that we’re respectful of each other and the dialogue back and forth, but also a brave space, in which we can talk about serious issues that we’re facing here at USC in terms of diversity and campus climate,” Sanchez said.
Conerly detailed the foundational history of cultural centers around the nation and USC cultural centers in particular.
According to Conerly, student centers emerged at predominantly white institutions as a result of student activism in the 1960s and ‘70s.
“We fast-forward to 2016, and we see that a lot of students are feeling a lot of the same things,” Conerly said. “They may be manifesting in different ways, but they’re still there.”
Carry provided background information on the details of current cultural spaces. He highlighted the three requests from the student Campus Climate Resolution — to expand existing cultural centers, add new cultural centers and increase budgeting — and looked to the forum to help formulate solutions.
Ho referenced her past experiences as the program director of Santa Clara University’s Office for Multicultural Learning and director of Asian Pacific American Student Services to emphasize the dissatisfaction she has had with the lack of progress in diversity talks.
“I do get frustrated around the same conversations that occur over and over again,” Ho said.
“We need to look at what we should do with what we have on this campus, and what do we need to add to what we have.”
USG Senate-elect Sabrina Enriquez closed out the panel, representing the opinions of the Campus Climate Coalition and others in the student body.
“The cultural centers we have are understaffed, underfunded and overcrowded,” she said. “Because certain groups haven’t been seen as worthy enough, students, especially students from these groups, have been exploited. All of these centers should be created at the same time.”
Enriquez emphasized the discrepancy between the amount of funding for cultural resource centers and the salaries of top USC administrators such as President C. L. Max Nikias.
Panelists then opened the floor for questions, which included discussions about spaces for cultural centers at the USC Village and special-interest floors in housing. Carry said that the agreement with the City of Los Angeles over the construction of the Village stipulated that a certain portion of it be set aside for retail space to replace the previous businesses in the old University Village.
Sanchez criticized the lack of transparency with the project, which he said is mostly residential space and lacks collaborative spaces for students that could be used for cultural resource centers.
Enriquez stressed that the conversation about increasing space should not create a competition between cultural centers for resources, but rather find a way to benefit all parties. She said creating a new facility for cultural resource centers could help alleviate the problem.
The next Campus Climate Open Forum will be held at the Vineyard Room at the Davidson Conference Center on March 30.
Sanchez said that these forums should generate action for campus climate issues on campus rather than inaction.
“We want to make sure these sessions aren’t just talking sessions, but action sessions,” Sanchez said.

The No. 7 Trojans defeated the No. 10 Bruins 95-71 on Wednesday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas to advance in the Pac-12 tournament.
USC finished with a perfect 3-0 record against UCLA this season, the first three-game sweep since the 1941-1942 season.
Despite the Bruins’ 96-70 victory over the Trojans just a year ago in the Pac-12 tournament, USC found a way to overcome UCLA thanks to clutch 3-point shooting, strong defensive play, superior rebounding and effective ball distribution.
“It was our intensity on defense,” sophomore Jordan McLaughlin said in a post-game interview with the Pac-12 Network. “When we get stops and are able to get in transition … we were able to get easy buckets.”
USC was up 14-2 early, opening 4-of-5 from 3-point range. The Bruins closed the lead to just four, but, like the teams’ last two meetings, the small lead would not last for long, as the Men of Troy exploded for 18 points in the last six minutes of the first half, entering halftime with a 48-29 advantage.
Junior guard Julian Jacobs was the game’s leading scorer and distributor in the first half, ending the half with 11 points to go along with seven assists, while UCLA’s leading scorer Bryce Alford was held without a field goal in the first half.
After 20 minutes of gameplay, freshmen forwards Bennie Boatwright and Chimezie Metu combined for 15 of USC’s 48 points off of 63 percent shooting. Three electrifying dunks from Metu and three deep 3-pointers from Boatwright signaled USC’s control of the first half.
Boatwright led the Trojans with 19 points, making 5-of-9 from distance. McLaughlin added 18 points, while junior forward Nikola Jovanovic finished with 16. Metu added 10 points and 11 rebounds off the bench.
“We just wanted to come out and just keep doing what we were doing in those two games [against UCLA],” Metu told the Pac-12 Network. “Coach ran some great plays, and I found a way to drive to the basket.”
The Trojans continued to excel in the second half. To start the half, USC extended its lead to 23 points on a free throw by Jovanovic, giving the Trojans a 54-31 advantage.
It helped that UCLA sophomore forward Thomas Welsh fouled out with 9:09 left in the game. Before Welsh fouled out, the junior was leading the Bruins with 12 points.
Without Welsh’s scoring and rebounding threats, Metu and Boatwright dominated the interior, finishing the contest with a combined 20 rebounds and 29 points.
95 points is the most USC has ever scored against UCLA and the Trojans ended the night with seven players with nine points or more.
With their historic 24-point win over the Bruins, the Trojans solidified their place in not only the second round of the Pac-12 tournament, but also a likely spot in the subsequent NCAA tournament.
The Trojans will go on to face No. 2 Utah in the second round on Thursday night.
“Utah’s a really tough team, but we feel we match up really well with them,” Metu said. “We’re just going to watch film and get ready for tomorrow.”
The Utes and Trojans are set to tip off at 6:15 p.m.

USC football kicked off spring practice on Tuesday, and for the first time in three years, the Trojans will be hosting a quarterback competition that is expected to turn some heads not only going into the summer, but also potentially into the fall.
Replacing Cody · With Cody Kessler moving on, the Trojans must pick between redshirt junior Max Browne and redshirt freshman Sam Darnold — both of whom are more mobile than Kessler — for their next quarterback. Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
With the departure of Cody Kessler, it appears that head football coach Clay Helton, who is entering his first full season at the helm, will have to tap either fourth-year junior Max Browne or redshirt freshman Sam Darnold to start the team’s season opener against defending national champion Alabama at Jerry’s World come Sept. 3.
Whether Helton elects to go with Browne or Darnold, the USC offense is going to be in good hands — perhaps even better off than it was when Kessler was under center. Kessler ended his career as one of the most statistically decorated quarterbacks in USC history and led the Trojans to its first Pac-12 South title in 2015 but was always limited by his arm strength, which also restricted the play-calling ability for Helton, who served as the team’s offensive coordinator last season.
Fans always criticized former head coach and now-Alabama offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin for calling a plethora of bubble screens in Kessler’s first season behind center, which seemed to be a contributing factor to his ultimate firing. The past two seasons, we’ve seen less of it, but it has still been a go-to play call for the USC offense, especially with one of the most dangerous playmakers in college football — junior wide receiver Adoree’ Jackson — on the edge.
That’s when USC would become predictable, however, and in the process, it allowed opposing defensive coordinators to simply game plan for Kessler and his offense by taking away those plays, forcing him to test his arm down the field.
Take a look at the team’s loss to Washington. Against the Huskies, Kessler completed only 16 of 29 passes for 156 yards to go along with two interceptions — good enough for a dismal quarterback rating of 9.4. Granted, Washington had the best overall defense in the Pac-12 last season, but if they want to be elite in 2016, new offensive coordinator Tee Martin and the Trojans are going to need a quarterback that is able to exploit any defense on any given day or night in the fall.
Fortunately for USC fans, Browne and Darnold are basically opposites of Kessler. With Browne listed at 6-foot-5, 220 pounds and Darnold at 6-foot-4, 215 pounds, each of them certainly looks the part. Both of them also have rocket arms and are considerably more mobile and athletic, especially Darnold.
Thus, the quarterback transition that is now taking place is actually a positive thing moving forward for the Trojans, as they move into what could be considered a new era of USC football under Helton. Call it an upgrade, if you will.
Of course, the jury is still out on the intangibles that both Browne and Darnold have to offer, including how to read coverage and handle pressure in the pocket, in addition to leading and dealing with adversity, certainly in a hostile environment with limited experience at the Division I level. USC’s array of explosive weapons returning on offense, however, will surely diminish the growing pains in both the passing and the running games.
Players like Jackson, Biletnikoff Award candidate and junior wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, and the two-headed rushing attack of senior Justin Davis and sophomore Ronald Jones II made Kessler look really efficient at times, and they are expected to do the same for their new starting quarterback.
It’s already a tall order to ask a brand-new starting quarterback to learn a system with a new coaching staff and be expected to give it their best shot at the defending national champs, but it’s a test that will benefit them in the long run.
Since Browne is more experienced, with Darnold redshirting last year, it’s definitely his “job to lose” — his words exactly at the team’s first practice on Tuesday.
The competition will be healthy for both Browne and Darnold, but it’s also important that Helton handles it in an appropriate manner by not letting it drag on too long. As a lot of us found out the hard way a few years ago with Kiffin, a quarterback competition that extends into the early part of the regular isn’t the best of ideas.
Typically, the sooner the better is the preferred practice not only for the quarterbacks, but also the team as a whole, and there’s no doubt that Helton’s final decision will define him and USC football at least for the next couple of years to come.

With four games under their belts, the women’s lacrosse team is continuing to dominate, as the Trojans are racing off to their best start in program history, boasting a 4-0 record.
With crucial wins against Duke and Michigan, the Trojans now hold a No. 11 ranking and look to continue to build upon the success that they have created in just their fourth year as a team.
This week, junior attacker Michaela Michael and sophomore midfielder Lydia Sutton earned MPSF honors for Offensive Player of the Week and Defensive Player of the Week respectively. For Michael, this award marks her second of the season and her fourth in her career. For Sutton, this award is her first in her debut as a Trojan. Continuing to add decorations, this week’s awards render the 16th for the Women of Troy in total, which include six offensive awards, five defensive awards and five rookie of the week honorees.
Michael demonstrated her offensive prowess in both of the Trojans’ games against Michigan and Vermont, recording 5 goals in each game. She also notched eight draw controls, triggered two turnovers and earned the 16th and 17th hat trick games of her career. With a .786 shots-on-goal percentage, Michael boasts 106 career goals rendering her just the third Trojan to score more than 100 career goals.
Sutton also was instrumental in the Trojan defensive unit, securing seven ground balls and forcing seven turnovers. Sutton and the entire Women of Troy defensive unit limited their opponents to a mere 15-for-29 rate on clear attempts.
The undefeated Trojans’ next contest is slated for March 14 at 3 p.m. as they welcome Stony Brook to McAlister Field.

The No. 43 women’s tennis team heads north to the Bay Area this weekend to face No. 23 Stanford on Friday and No. 1 Cal on Saturday.
USC has an undefeated 2-0 record in the Pac-12 after a 5-2 win over Washington last Friday and a 5-1 win over Washington State last Saturday. Their overall record for the season is 5-4.
The team struggled this season before entering the conference swing, recording three consecutive losses.
“You just have to be positive,” head coach Richard Gallien said after beating Washington. “[You have to] try very hard, making this blind assumption that something good is going to happen as long as you’re motivated and don’t do dumb things, don’t start blaming it saying, ‘It’s this person’s fault,’ and stay steady.”
The Trojans can rely on five nationally ranked players. Leading the Trojans is senior Giuliana Olmos, currently ranked No. 25. Olmos recorded two straight set wins over the weekend against the Washington schools at first singles.
Sophomores Gabby Smith and Madison Westby are ranked at No. 90 and No. 101, respectively. Freshmen Rianna Valdes and Jessica Failla are currently at No. 111 and No. 125.
Valdes was forced to retire at the end of the second set on Friday against Washington due to injury. On Saturday against Washington State, her spot at sixth singles was taken by freshman Kristen Venter.
“We definitely had some up and downs in the season.” Venter said after her first match on Saturday. “We’ve had a lot of injuries and technical things, like any other sports things, aren’t always going to go as planned. You need to have a plan B and C.”
In doubles, Olmos and Smith are ranked No. 8 in the country. Smith is also at No. 53, with Failla.
First up on the road for USC is No. 23 Stanford. The Cardinal are 6-3 overall and 1-1 in the conference after they beat Arizona 5-2 and fell short to Arizona State 4-3. Stanford has four players ranked nationally — juniors Taylor Davidson, Caroline Doyle and Carol Zhao are ranked 26th, 55th and 59th, respectively. Senior Krista Hardebeck is currently at No. 88.
On Saturday, the Women of Troy will face No. 1 Cal. The Golden Bears are currently undefeated at 12-0 and have a 2-0 Pac-12 record.
In singles, five players are ranked nationally for Cal. At No. 11 is senior Klara Fabikova, followed by junior Maegan Manasse at No. 12, senior Lynn Chi at No. 56, junior Denise Starr at No. 60 and freshman Olivia Hauger at No. 77.
The Bears have two pairs ranked nationally. At No. 4 is Manasse and Star and at No. 72 is Fabikova and Hauger.
First serve is at 1:30 p.m. on Friday and at 12 p.m. on Saturday.
It is a sad state of affairs when team is ranked 43rd in the country. Time for a change in the coaching staff after like 21 years,
and this is what is produced with a new look stadium added to help recruiting.

After an action-packed opening weekend that saw the USC beach volleyball team notch three wins over top-10 opponents, the No. 2-ranked Women of Troy (3-1) will open up their home slate Thursday at Merle Norman Stadium when they host Arizona State (2-2) at 6 p.m., followed by two matches on Friday against No. 4-ranked Florida State (4-0) at 11 a.m. and Loyola Marymount (1-2) at 12:30 p.m.
Following a heartbreaking 3-2 loss last weekend to Pepperdine in Malibu, fifth-year head coach Anna Collier knows that her team will need to make some adjustments during this home stand.
“It was one of those things that happen in sport where you end up playing at the level of your opponent, and I think that’s what happened to us a bit on Saturday,” Collier said. “We didn’t play our usual level of USC beach volleyball, so we need to stay within what we’re capable of doing regardless of what’s happening on the other side of the net.”
The match against Pepperdine would mark the first loss in nearly a year for USC, which had its program-best 29-match winning streak snapped. However, not all was lost on the weekend as the Women of Troy managed to pull out a sweep over crosstown rival UCLA, marking the fourth win in as many tries against the Bruins. While disappointed that the team couldn’t pull out a win against the Waves, junior captain Sophie Bukovec still found some positive takeaways.
“It was definitely tough losing against Pepperdine,” Bukovec said. “We were super close … but sweeping UCLA 5-0 is always really, really nice too. I think all of our team played really hard; we had a few comebacks, and it just showed our edge … I think it’s a really good start to our season.”
Now, the Women of Troy will gear up for their first home match of the year against Arizona State. The last meeting between USC and the Sun Devils was last April when the Women of Troy earned a 4-1 victory to clinch the 2015 Pac-12 Invitational title. USC also owns a perfect record against ASU at 3-0 all-time.
One duo that Collier hopes can defend home court against the Sun Devils is her No. 3 pair of juniors Nicolette Martin and Allie Wheeler.
“Nic and Allie were a team that went undefeated over the weekend,” Collier said. “They played solid, and they just took care of their jobs … They were really the leaders of the weekend and handled what they needed to do.”
Martin and Wheeler were rewarded for their efforts by the conference on Tuesday as well, making history as the first-ever Pac-12 Pair of the Week. The veterans went 4-0 in dual matches at the Pepperdine Kick-Off and clinched the victory for USC over No. 4 Long Beach State with an exciting three-set win. In total, Martin and Wheeler dropped just two of the 10 sets they played on the weekend.
The matches against Florida State and Loyola Marymount will be broadcast on the Pac-12 Network.
Collier acknowledges the fact that her team can make some big strides this week with a good showing on their home sand.
“We need to understand that everyone is going to be playing their best match against us, and I think [the team] learned that lesson this weekend,” Collier said. “We need to go back and reiterate that and just make sure we take care of our side of the court. We’re not where we want to be just yet, but we’re getting there.”

Renowned comedian Tina Fey once said, “The difference between male comedy writers and female comedy writers is that the male ones are taller and weigh more.”
The idea that women can’t be comedians, that women don’t have a sense of humor. , and other gender-biased stereotypes will be put to rest as women of color will come together and take on the comedic and creative domain that is overrun by white males.
The Women’s Center for Creative Work, a small nonprofit organization, will be hosting Women of Color in Comedy, an ensemble which will display performances of monologues, sketches and songs. The highly anticipated event will be directed by Rebecca Aranda and presented by One Axe Plays, a branch of WCCW.
One Axe Plays is a film and theater collective for women working in the creative professions that involve writing, directing, acting and comedy. They strive for the promotion of work and stories by women through showcases, singular productions and short films, in addition to other outlets. This promotion builds a thriving network where creators can work together and consistently produce high-quality pieces for public enjoyment. Its host, the WCCW, was founded in 2013 and prides itself on teaching women how to uplift themselves and others. The WCCW advocates for female-led creative businesses and projects throughout Los Angeles.
The Women of Color In Comedy ensemble on Friday and Saturday will feature a cast of women from  entirely different backgrounds. They will be sharing anecdotes as well as performing sketches that touch on their personal lives. While many share differences in their upbringing, they all have one thing in common: They’re all extremely funny. Performances will be put on by nine talented women, including Nikki Bailey, Pili Valdes, Sue Chan, Michelle Sam, Lorraine DeGraffenreidt, Adrienne Gomez, Shawn Richards, Elia Saldana and Jovita Trujillo.
To be a part of this event, head out to the Women’s Center for Creative Work located on 2425 Glover Pl. on March 11 and 12 from 8-10 p.m. The event is on a first come first served basis and contingent upon a donation to the WCCW. Suggested admission is a small donation of $5 to $10.

Femme fatale · Author Staceyann Chin recounts her past as a half-Jamaican, half-Chinese woman in her memoir, Other Side of Paradise. – Photo courtesy of Simon and Schuster
I often make people uncomfortable. Sometimes, it’s because I’m a hijab-wearing Muslim and that scares the Islamophobes. Sometimes, it’s because of how I write. People say I’m too intense, too feminist, too loud while trying to be heard. When I was younger, I viewed “too” as a negative word. It meant that I should be less of what I am so people don’t think I’m too much, so they think I’m just right.
But then I grew up and realized that I didn’twant to be just right — I didn’t want to be one of the many trying to fit in because in the so-called diverse land known as the United States, I will never be just another face. In the eyes of the public, I’m a criminal, and my rap sheet includes being a brown, loud, female Muslim with a moody temperament. And that’s OK.
As with most of my column so far, I take the long, rambling way to make a point. This week is no different.
The previous Thursday, after a long day of class and midterms, I attended the Survivor Speak Out event, which was part of the Woman Student Assembly’s Take Back the Night week. All I wanted was to go back to my dorm and repay my sleep debt, but I’d never been to Take Back the Night before, and my curiosity won out. My column had also come out that day, and I’d written about sexual assault, so I felt compelled to hear what sexual assault survivors thought of USC’s abysmal sexual assault and harassment rates.
The event took place at E.F. Hutton Park — that small, sloping space outside of old Annenberg. Many students were already gathered, spread out on blankets on the damp grass, holding electric candles in homage to those affected by sexual assault. A hush fell over the place, an almost sacred and unbreakable silence as we collectively held our breaths for what was to come.
Nothing could have prepared me for the emotional rollercoaster that took place. While the survivors who went on stage both broke my heart and made me outraged with their stories of sexual assault or partner violence, the keynote speaker resonated with me stronger than anything had that week.
Half-black, half-Chinese keynote speaker Staceyann Chin was an all-star. Although she was physically tiny, her personality took up the entire stage. Her voice was strong at times and soft at others, as she performed some of her poems and read excerpts from her book, The Other Side of Paradise.
Chin was abandoned by her mother as a child, and she didn’t know who her father was, only that he was Chinese. Her skin was lighter than that of the other children in Paradise, Jamaica, where she grew up, which earns her the status of “white girl.” She was also repeatedly sexually assaulted as a child — she describes her cousin’s sweaty hand making its way up her thigh with disgusting detail.
She spoke mostly in a loud, brash voice. She spoke about sex, masturbation and rape. She poked the audience until our timid answers were roars in the dark night, the space around us illuminated by the electric candles we held up high. She said “f-ck” a lot.
Chin made me uncomfortable.
In our little college bubble of privilege, it’s rare we’re made to feel uncomfortable. We may occasionally come across views we don’t agree with and people we don’t like, but we almost always are able to brush them off. Our lives are so privileged that we aren’t able to experience the feeling of being uncomfortable in our day-to- day lives, let alone go outside of our comfort zones. Although college is where we go to become full-fledged human upon graduation, it’s easy to remain unchanged in a campus as apolitical and sheltered as USC.
After the event, Chin’s voice was still ringing in my ears. I bought the Kindle version of The Other Side of Paradise because that uncomfortable feeling was mostly new, and I wanted to hold onto it.
Chin’s book is, as one reviewer calls it, “a captivating portrait of an artist as a young woman.” In it, she recounts every heartbreaking detail of her past.
Often memoirs are a mix of bravado and woe-is-me. Despite having had a terrible childhood, Chin’s memoir read like a competition of one-up-manship where the category is “worst life ever.” It’s a tragic book, yes, but Chin’s voice is consistently clear. She discusses race unabashedly and relays the dangers of being a young woman in a world where sexual violence is the easiest way to obtain power. Her resilience speaks through her words and is endlessly empowering and admirable.
Chin has always been a fighter. Everyone thought new born Chin, born several months premature, would barely live past her first week, let alone live long enough to write a memoir.
In her memoir, Chin writes: “It tickles me to think that from my very first breath, everyone expected me to stop breathing. Against the odds, I surprised everybody. And I must admit that in some of the moments of my life so far, no one has been more taken aback by my own breath than me.”

On a course that gives pause to some of the best golfers in the nation, the men’s golf team was not intimidated as they took home the team championship on Wednesday at the Southern Highlands Collegiate, hosted at the Southern Highlands Country Club in Nevada.
The Southern Highlands C.C., nestled in the Las Vegas Valley, is renowned as being one of the nation’s toughest courses. It has played host to two PGA Tour events since it was established in 1999 and served as one of the toughest hurdles of the year for each of the schools that competed in the tournament.
“I am so proud of our team,” head coach Chris Zambri said. “This golf course is the most challenging course we’ll play all year. Winning here says that we are a very good team.”
Led by junior Rico Hoey and Sean Crocker, the No. 4 Trojans fought back after finishing one stroke out of the lead at the end of the first day of the competition. They took the lead on Day 2 and never looked back, finishing with a final score of +5, 4 strokes better than the No. 12 Florida Gators. USC was one of four top-10 teams to compete in the tournament, along with No. 6 Arizona State (who finished tied for fourth), No. 1 Illinois (T-8th), and No. 8 Alabama (T-13th).
Crocker turned in the second-best individual score of the tournament by finishing at -3; his score was his fourth top-eight score this year and his second consecutive top-eight finish — he finished tied for fifth at last week’s Southwestern Jones Invitational. Crocker tied his personal best finish this season, as he also came in second at the season-opening Husky Invitational.
Hoey finished in the top-10 for the sixth consecutive tournament, and his final round score of 72 was the Trojans’ best. He birdied two holes on the front nine in the final round, and his final tally is his seventh top-10 of the season. Freshman Justin Suh tied for 14th in the tournament with a score of +3; his finish was his second top-20 finish on the year. Senior Andrew Levitt, who won the individual championship at the Southwestern Jones Invitational, tied for 27th at the Southern Highlands Collegiate with a score of +7. Sophomore Jonah Texeira was USC’s final golfer of record, finishing tied for 47th with a final score of +10.
The Trojans, who were already trending upward in the national rankings, expect to see a further boost after their second consecutive team victory, and their third overall in the spring season. The team now looks ahead to The Goodwin, which will take place in Palo Alto between March 24-26 at the Stanford Golf Course.

There’s a beautiful fireplace outside my apartment complex, Cardinal Gardens. It’s often on at odd times, but when it is, the courtyard is enlivened with the kind of relaxing atmosphere to study with friends that just screams “college.”
So when, earlier this week, a Facebook post revealed that a fellow Asian Pacific American was sitting in front of my favorite fireplace when he was attacked by eggs and racial slurs, it’s safe to say that the spot holds a different overtone for me now. Given the unparalleled student efforts to better our campus climate over the past year, it is heartbreaking to confront the reality that things may not have changed that much.
And when it was later revealed that the perpetrator was also Asian American, I didn’t know how to react. Some used the perpetrator’s ethnicity as a reason to excuse his actions — but far from diminishing the impact of this hate crime, his APA identity calls for greater reflection about how internalized racism continues to manifest itself in more nuanced ways than ever before.
It’s unfair for me to speculate as to why this individual chose to perpetuate racial slurs that harmed his own racial group. But he is not alone. Internalized oppression, as sociologists like W. E. B. Du Bois explained, clarifies why minorities may act in ways that are counterproductive to their community’s interests. In a world that so often defines minorities by race first, it’s not surprising that they begin to incorporate them as part of their psyche.
“It is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity,” Du Bois wrote.
On a college campus, internalizing racism through language is a social access point. But though self-deprecation may seem endearing, perpetuating slurs against one’s own racial group is a sobering preservation of existing stereotypes that have very real consequences.
And though people of color by definition cannot be racist — since they do not benefit from perpetuating white supremacy — they can most definitely be discriminatory to other racial groups, to members of their own racial group or to other identity groups.
As an outsider, it’s easy to see why someone might be more forgiving to the student who perpetrated a hate crime because of his APA identity. But regardless of the intention or identity of the individual who threw eggs, the victim still felt disrespected and unwelcome, so much so that he posted about the incident on Facebook. The incident still preserves a sense that Asian Americans are, according to California State University Northridge professor Que-Lam Huynh, “perpetual foreigners.” And since mainstream race relations conversations are so often black and white (literally), it still suggests that Asian-American communities are less important when it comes to dealing with racism.
On a grander scale, similar tensions in the Asian-American community have recently manifested in protests and counter-protests for and against the conviction of NYPD cop Peter Liang, who fatally wounded an unarmed black man. While some say that Liang should not be a scapegoat for white police brutality, his APA identity does not erase the effects his actions have on black communities. And just as Liang should not be absolved due to his race, so too should the perpetrator of the hate crime at Cardinal Gardens be held accountable.
Like many APA Trojans at this moment in time, I’m left with more questions than answers. I’m unsure what this incident means for Asian-American solidarity, for dismantling tropes that have for so long defined us and for working to craft more challenging and self-aware conversations. But in our own communities, we need to realize that we are not immune from inflicting prejudice and discrimination. The most we can do is start and continue a critical dialogue to more closely explore these concepts and reinforce policy efforts for tolerance and exclusion — both in our ethnic communities and outside them.

The perp was probably “Asian American” because he was a Hapa, or half asian. 
Half Asians are trained through their mothers to hate and victimize anything Asian. Then when called out on this they claim they are Asian as well.
Trust me on this, I’m Eurasian.
If you want to go down this path, just google “Half Asian blog.”
Riiight, because you said so, and because some “Half Asian blog” said so. Half Asian people try so hard to win the validation of full Asians, and perhaps that’s why the perp threw eggs at the victim.
You obviously have no idea what you’re talking about.

Texas legislators voted in 2015 to require public universities to allow concealed guns on campus and in classrooms. While the law does not take effect until Aug. 1, the decision received ardent reactions from both supporters and opponents. Just last week, Fritz Steiner, dean of the Texas School of Architecture, announced that he would be leaving the university due to the implementation of the law. The legislation does not allow public universities the choice of whether or not to follow this rule; however, an institution deserves the right to decide to allow guns.
Supporters of “campus carry” laws cite constitutional rights and self-defense as key reasons to allow the concealed possession of a firearm. They use the possibility of a mass shooting as reasoning for allowing students to carry a firearm, but the argument has little merit in a real-life situation. Last summer, shortly after the vote for this new Texas law, the University of Texas Chancellor William McRaven, a former Navy SEAL, explained that minimally trained gun owners— most permit holders— would not fare well in an adrenaline-fueled, high-stakes situation. Some might even argue that an inexperienced civilian could unintentionally make the situation worse. Regardless, each school knows what is best for its student body and its campus environment, so it is something a university’s administration — not the state government — is best suited to decide.
In regard to exercising Second Amendment rights, the Texas campus carry law might seem like a win. However, it is incorrect to assume that this right can or should be guaranteed at a school. As with students’ limited freedom of speech, the right to carry a gun should be subject to the administration’s authority. In the outcome of the landmark Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District case, the Supreme Court ruled that the students’ freedom of speech can be removed by school officials in an effort to keep order. The same mindset should be applied to the Second Amendment. Whether it is a high school or a university, an educational institution has a duty to protect students and keep order among them. If it considers a weapons ban the correct way to do so, it has a duty to enforce one.
California took the approach opposite from Texas: following the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, California Governor Jerry Brown signed a law banning concealed guns from college campuses. Regardless of whether a person has legally obtained the gun, the only exceptions to the law are if the carrier is retired from law enforcement or has permission from the university. Even though the California regulation also applies to private universities — unlike the Texas law — it allows some institutional freedom. Texas legislators did not give state universities the choice to lift the ban, they forced them to. On the contrary, California grants its schools the right to decide certain exceptions. Such a decision sets a positive precedent, although institutions do not have full freedom.
The Texas law paved the way for private universities to lift their bans on guns, but not one has even announced plans to do so. Additionally, before the 2015 California legislation, USC did not allow firearms on campus. These decisions imply that many college s— easily more than just those mentioned — are not comfortable with allowing any or all students to carry guns. With this in mind, it is only fair to give universities a choice in this matter, instead of simply forcing them to eliminate regulations.

I’m not a journalist, but I pretend to be. As the managing editor of USC’s satirical newspaper The Sack of Troy, I deal in lies. As a pretend journalist, I was told to follow the money, and the money is in clicks. Website clicks seem to have come to dominate the landscape of modern journalism more than news itself. But this isn’t a new phenomenon, nor is this phenomenon new to me; however, I reached the proverbial last straw when I read a hastily put-together article from my campus’ edition of The Tab, a “news” website made for and by college students that currently has over 45 campuses under its wings.
Photo via Facebook (The Tab USC)
The Tab is a college campus’ version of the longform articles that Buzzfeed puts out. These articles are the most insidious of Buzzfeed’s three heads, being listicles, videos and articles (and yes, much like Dante’s Satan, Buzzfeed also has three heads). But this isn’t another one of those self-aggrandizing millennial thought pieces lamenting the death of classical journalism — this is just a shout into the void that is the internet.
Clicks rule the internet, and out of this, clickbait was born. These articles are so bad because they don’t tell us anything. The inciting incident here for me was an article from The Tab that was about a USC student who had eggs and racial slurs hurled at him one weekend and wrote a several paragraph-long Facebook post about it. USC’s Tab staff, just as instructed, took this important story and churned out an article about it as fast as possible. The only problem is that it didn’t say anything at all. It was a paraphrasing of the Facebook post and nothing more. It was like a TL;DR for the post that was longer than the post itself. This wasn’t journalism, or at least “investigative journalism.” No interviews were taken, no points of view were expressed and no research was done at all.
I feel that this trend of turning out content in lieu of substance is indicative of a larger problem. Who’s first is what matters now, not who’s best, and that’s a problem. Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein didn’t tweet about Watergate as soon as they noticed something wasn’t right. They researched, checked and double-checked sources and proofread before publishing, and thanks to their exhaustive work, the public actually got to the bottom of one of the largest presidential scandals in U.S. history.
Another scandal that The Tab recently covered was Undergraduate Student Government Sen. Jacob Ellenhorn’s recent epistle challenging the impeachment charges brought against him by the Program Board. Aside from creating his own hashtag “#SaveJacob,” Ellenhorn is most well-known for providing a meretricious platform via the USC College Republicans for bigots and sexists like Ben Shapiro and Milo Yiannopoulos. Opinions are good, but giving an uninterrupted platform to such a divisive point of view is harmful, and that’s exactly what The Tab did when they hastily published Jacob’s missive complete with his point of view and his alone. By not waiting for the opinions of the other parties involved to be heard, or giving interviews to anyone else but this one man, they once again placed brummagem content over true substance and perpetuated a harmful slant.
But I digress because good journalism still exists in the world, papers are still made and good articles are still published. I just think that we should be mindful of what we consume and mindful of whether it’s clickbait or substance. The fact that VICE, a publication that made its name by going further and investigating deeper than any other source, has now relegated itself to mostly millennial think pieces, sex stories and drug diaries is a paradigm of this trend.
But again I digress, because what can I do? What can anyone do when Buzzfeed’s estimated net worth tops $1.5 billion and VICE’s $1.4 billion, and newspapers are going out of style?

USC  does that stand for University for Socialists and Communists….   as far we REAL Americans are concerned we do STILL have that bill of rights you morons keep NOT reading—.. it’s attached to that thing called a Constitution–which you guys also hate.     If I were jacob…  i’d already be talking to lawyers  to not only bring USC into litigation.. but also to sue each and every single student senator who votes to restrict the first amendment clause by silencing a republican student senator for his conservative views.    we’re all watching this very closely.. and this is one battle  you liberal communists will lose..    #ConservativeLivesMatter
Sounds like the Trojan is infested with liberal scum that loves illegal alien dreamers, viva Trump 2016!
So you’re trying to tell us that because you consider two well-known media personalities, Shapiro and Yiannopoulos, to be “bigots” and “sexists” (you’re entitled to your own opinion), they should not be allowed to speak on campus? 
And I also understand you’re indicating here that you believe that having invited well-known people whose opinions you find unacceptable is grounds for impeaching an elected Student Government official? 
Do they still teach about Freedom of Speech at my Alma Mater, or are they too busy arguing about “safe spaces” these days?

I was cooking some corn in the kitchen when Tumi, my roommate, told me that Patience, her friend and a student at University of Cape Town, was going to crash at our place for a few days until she got her housing sorting out. Upon further questioning, I learned what had happened to Patience and the other students that arrived this year. It makes more sense when put in context, so let me start by explaining the Rhodes Must Fall movement, as told by your foolish but faithful white American narrator.  
When RMF first started in March 2015, the students were protesting to take down the statue of Cecil Rhodes, as part of a wider movement to “decolonize” education. This group of student protesters came to represent the voices of black students that were marginalized in a university system that makes it substantively more difficult for them to register for classes, understand lectures in Afrikaans* and yes, get granted housing.
It turns out that someone at the university had made a huge oopsie and overbooked the rooms for the semester, leaving several students in standing with a suitcase and nowhere to go. Nowhere but Transit, that is. Transit, as I gleaned from the whites of Patiences’ eyes, is a massive room with rows and rows of beds, where students who don’t have accommodations can stay until their real housing is sorted out, a system which could take months. At first, protests were held in the lawn of the Vice Chancellor’s house, asking that international students or white students that have the means to relocate to non-university housing do so for the sake of homeless students.
According to a recent article, the group claims the university marginalises black South African students when allocating residences, while accommodating white international students. The university responded by saying “less than 2% of beds are given to semester abroad students.”
The reasons behind this overbooking of housing varies with who you ask. On one hand, UCT has a policy which states that if students cannot afford to pay their fees for the previous semester, then they are prohibited from registering for another semester of classes. For many students, this means that if they can’t afford a student loan (and they aren’t doled out often here), they face the risk of not affording schooling from one semester to the next. This was the fire that fueled Rhodes Must Fall’s second phase, Fees Must Fall, which was a series of protests that lasted throughout the past year. Knowing that some students face the risk of unexpectedly dropping out, the university overbooked the rooms to fill up spots that actually never opened up. However, due to the Fees Must Fall protests last semester, many students requested they defer their exams to this semester, and the housing that they got in order to take their exams took the place of students who were actually meant to live in those rooms. Some say this explanation is an attempt to blame student protesters.
Whatever the case, it is impossible not to recognize that we, as Americans, are involved in the problem. When applying to UCT, I requested that I live in a dorm with South African roommates simply because I wanted an immersive experience, and I am lucky enough to have that opportunity. Unfortunately, I did not realize when I was selecting this super fun option back at home that it would be at the expense of a first year student, one that may have flown all the way from Limpopo to come to school, who is now told to pack his or her bags for an indefinite, miserable sleepover in the back of what I imagine looks like a Costco warehouse.
The next day, a shack was erected on campus, with the word “SHACKVILLE” emblazoned across the wall. That night, a group of protesters stoned one of the Jammies (buses) that shuttle students back and forth to school. They also set one on fire, and its charred remains stared at me spookily for a few days as I boarded other Jammies at the bus stop, feeling oddly guilty. There were, of course, conversations about damage to property and violent protesting, but I think it was a telling demonstration of how frustrated students feel. If you’re setting an entire bus on fire, maybe it’s more important to look past the value of the bus and listen to the value of the pained human voices trying to be heard.

I’m in a compromised position by being dually unqualified to speak accurately of the political and racial issues here at UCT as a white American here for a quick semester, and of the issues of rising tuition back at USC. From my humble observations, though, UCT seems to be more open to hearing student’s grievances. In one of my classes, a girl spoke up that it was unfair that our two class representatives were men. A few weeks later, there was a heated discussion where students were upset that professional attire was to be graded during our final presentations. In both cases, my professor stopped class entirely and allowed the rest of the class period to be an open forum for students to disagree with her policies and vote to change them. In both cases, the students won their case, and class returned as normal. On a more campus wide basis, it’s a little more complicated. In the end, UCT did find housing for the displaced students, although it’s unclear where this housing came from. And the Rhodes statue I mentioned before did come down in less than a month, but the institutional discrimination left in its wake still continues to persist.

USC aims to make institutional changes from the start, by speaking at meetings with administrative officials and trying to elect a student trustee representative. Meanwhile, RMF students maintain the culture of bottom-up calls to action. Despite these comparisons, there is actually no right way to compare the frustrations felt from students on these two sides of the world. And it’s unclear what the outcomes will be, but I’m interested to see how it plays out with these different approaches.
*Across South Africa, some lectures are still taught in Afrikaans, the language spoken by the architects of apartheid. Few students here speak English as their first language, and the expectation to learn Afrikaans as well in order to be able to follow along in lectures puts added academic pressure on black students. This is one of many legacies of apartheid that RMF hopes to dismantle.

“Get out of Auckland as much as you can.”
That was the number one piece of advice that I heard from New Zealanders. While the big city has plenty of perks, it’s the small towns and miles of beautiful, rugged landscape that people come all the way across the world for. Unfortunately, those are a little hard to get to by public transportation.
So, I took my first real road trip in New Zealand this past weekend. In an unexpected turn of events, I ended up driving. Here are my rules of the road after cruising more than 400 kilometers:
1. Watch the wipers: Driving on the left actually wasn’t the most difficult part of the whole endeavor. Ten minutes in, and I barely noticed it anymore. The real challenge was learning to become familiar with the car. The levers that control the windshield wipers and the turn signals are on the other side of the steering wheel in foreign cars, so I kept accidentally turning on my wipers when I wanted to turn right. And it was clear, blue skies. All weekend long. Awkward.
2. Bring a Bluetooth speaker: My friends and I tried to tune into the radio, but finding a station with the right vibe and a strong signal proved to be harder than we thought. In the end, we ended up using a Bluetooth speaker and an iPod to get some driving tunes. An aux cable and a phone charger would also be some handy accessories for a road trip.
3. Grab those free maps at the car rental: Those maps have “tourist” written all over it, but I’m not ashamed. Those maps were easy to read and had labeled a lot of the tourist stuff we wanted to see. It’s also good to know some of the names of the towns that are in the same direction as your destination, so that you know you’re going in the right direction along the way.
4. Map without cellular data: If you are trying to save money abroad by skimping on the international phone plan, you can still be a stellar navigator/co-pilot/DJ/shotgun rider by loading the Google Map directions when you have Wi-Fi. On the app, you can download the map beforehand and the GPS will still work when you leave the free Wi-Fi zone. The only catch is that it won’t re-route, but by looking at your little blue dot, you can usually figure out how to get back on track pretty easily.
5. Give yourself plenty of time: Every single time, renting a car ends up turning into a race against time. Make sure you save time for filling up with gas, getting stuck in traffic and dropping off your friends. These weekend trips are quick, but “fast and furious” is no way to road trip. Instead, take your time and see where the road takes you.
