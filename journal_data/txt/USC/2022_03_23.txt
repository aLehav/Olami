The Rossier School of Education will not participate in U.S. News & World Report’s annual graduate school rankings this year, citing data inaccuracies taking place over at least the last five years.
USC has informed the United States Department of Education and accreditors of the inaccuracies and is currently conducting an investigation through outside law firm Jones Day, Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Charles Zukoski said in a statement to the Rossier community Wednesday. 
“I support the university’s decision to conduct an independent investigation and appreciate that everyone who has been asked has participated fully,” said Pedro Noguera, Emery Stoops and Joyce King Stoops Dean of Rossier, in the statement. 
A Rossier faculty member familiar with the situation told the Wall Street Journal that the withdrawal may be related to the groups of graduate students included in the school’s submission. The flawed data would have falsely raised GRE scores, they said. 
“Please know that this decision has no bearing on the quality or value of a Rossier education,” Zukoski wrote. “Rather, it reflects our responsibility, which we take very seriously, to adhere to the specific reporting requirements of the ranking organization when we submit our data.”
The investigation follows a series of college ranking controversies across the country that have placed rankings’ validity and effectiveness under question for some. 
At Temple University, a federal judge found former TU Business School Dean Moshe Porat guilty of providing fraudulent information to ranking sites, according to the Wall Street Journal. A judge sentenced Porat to 14 months imprisonment March 11 and imposed a $250,000 fine for his role in inflating the ranking of the Richard J. Fox School of Business and Management — the school’s online M.B.A program ranked No. 1 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report from 2015 to 2018. 
An adjacent controversy arose at Columbia University, where mathematics faculty member Michael Thaddeus accused the administration of reporting “inaccurate, dubious or highly misleading” data about class sizes and other factors considered in college rankings, according to reporting conducted by the New York Times. Columbia climbed from No. 18 in the U.S. News & World Report in 1988 to a tie with Harvard University and M.I.T. for No. 2 last year, which Thaddeus said is not proportionate to the improvement in the quality of the education offered at the university.
Rossier’s graduate program tied for No. 11 in last year’s report, rising in the ranks from a No. 15 position in 2015. The University will share the investigation’s findings within the next two weeks, Zukoski said.

A court official confirmed Wednesday that the trial of Jovan Vavic, former USC men’s and women’s water polo head coach, will be delayed after the judge presiding the case contracted coronavirus.
A spokesperson for the United States Federal Court for the District of Massachusetts said in a statement to ESPN that Judge Indira Talwani tested positive for coronavirus and that the trial would be postponed until Monday.
USC dismissed Vavic in March 2019, soon after allegations surfaced naming him as a participant in William “Rick” Singer’s college admissions scheme, which, in turn, prompted federal investigations. Vavic pleaded not guilty to charges of federal programs bribery, conspiracy to commit racketeering and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud.
Prosecutors alleged Singer paid Vavic $250,000 “to a bank account at USC that funded VAVIC’s water polo team” and also “made private school tuition payments for VAVIC’s children” disguised as a fake scholarship, according to the indictment. In exchange for the money, Vavic designated the daughter of Agustin Huneeus, Jr., a vineyard owner in Napa, Calif., as a water polo recruit to increase her chances of admission to USC.
Singer allegedly bribed four USC Athletics staffers, including Vavic and former associate athletic director Donna Heinel. The former director was dismissed alongside Vavic. 
“On multiple occasions between 2014 and 2018, Singer’s clients made payments of more than 1.3 million to USC accounts controlled by [Heinel], typically an account for the USC Women’s Athletic Board,” court documents read. “Singer also entered into a sham consulting agreement with Heinel … in exchange for the bribe payments Heinel helped facilitate the admission of more than two dozen students as recruited athletes.” 
Singer’s USC clients include “Fuller House” actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, USC associate professor of dentistry Homayoun Zadeh, resort executive Gamal Abdelaziz and investment firm CEO Robert Zangrillo. Court documents alleged clients paid Singer to take such measures as faking profiles, doctoring photographs and fabricating admissions test scores to facilitate applications’ admission to USC. 
Vavic is one of more than 50 coaches and executives implicated in the FBI college admissions scandals investigation, named Operation Varsity Blues. More than 30 have been given sentences involving prison time, time under supervised release, community service and five-to-six figure fines.
The trial is expected to last four weeks once commencing.

The Undergraduate Student Government unanimously approved a senate resolution in support of Ukrainian students and a funding proposal for fentanyl test strips for students Tuesday. 
The support of Ukrainian students resolution, presented during the March 8 senate meeting and authored by senator Arie Abija and senator Diego Andrades, asks USC to make accommodations and stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian student community to provide them with tangible and coordinated support and resources.
The fentanyl test strip funding proposal, also presented during the last senate meeting,  proposed a $3,500 program to distribute 3,500 fentanyl test strips in collaboration with Trojan Awareness Combating Overdose. 
Chief programming officer Jessica Minsol Kim announced the potential incorporation of two assemblies: the Middle Eastern and North African Student Assembly and the Military Associated Student Assembly. This will be the third time that the groups present to become an assembly. The senate will vote on the incorporation Wednesday and release results at the end of the week.
“This is something that both groups have worked so hard for,” Kim said. “We’ve made a few changes to how this process is done … I’m optimistic that, regardless of the results this year, there will just be more clarity to all the processes, and it will be a smoother process.”
Senior executive aide and chair of the COVID-19 and return to campus taskforce Katelyn Lee also presented about the committee’s future as coronavirus cases decrease on campus. Created as a special task force during the pandemic, the committee is “no longer really necessary,” and will hopefully “no longer ever be necessary again,” Lee said.
Affordability and basic needs chair Jaynelle Granados shared the committee’s recent projects, including a memo and legal review for work study alternatives that the committee looks to pilot within the next year. The committee, Granados said, will potentially host a clothing drive at the end of the semester and implement a meal swipe donation program. 
“I’m really proud of the progress we’ve made,” Granados wrote. “We were able to donate additional funds to the JCPenny Suit Up Program that happened recently … we are continuously working on addressing food insecurity … we really try to always have this community present and in mind because we know it’s often the first-gen, former foster youth, low income, undocumented student populations who are marginalized and underserved, so we always want to provide the best work, projects and resources we can. ”
Kim also presented on USG’s reallocated $71,180 spring budget surplus. Funds were distributed to five groups, the Asian Pacific American Student Assembly, the Queer and Ally Student Assembly, Student Assembly for Accessibility, the Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment and the Concerts Committee, with the latter two assemblies receiving the most allocations, $15,000 and $47,528.20, respectively. All requested reallocations were met except for the Concerts Committee, which initially asked for $50,000. 
Andrades introduced a senate resolution in support of faculty calls for higher pay following a faculty open letter that, at the time of publication, garnered more than 740 signatures. 
The resolution, which states that USG believes professors deserve an adjusted yearly wage to meet costs of living, urges for the addition of merit-based bonuses and raises. The resolution will be debated and voted on next week. 
Andrades also announced that the Hues of Healing: Restorative Art Therapy for Survivors of Sexual Assault and Their Allies event will take place on Friday. The event is intended to create a community for sexual assault survivors to heal through meditation, writing and large-scale, collective gestural painting led by guest artist Claudia Concha.
Cabinet positions for chief of staff, chief programming officer, chief financial officer, chief diversity officer and chief communications officer applications for the upcoming academic year will be due on Friday. Assembly elections are in progress and committee director applications will be available next week.

As BA.2 coronavirus variant cases increase around the world, USC Student Health is watching its impacts on the University very closely, Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman said during a student media briefing Tuesday. The University had its first BA.2 case in January, and cases have slowly increased since. The variant is currently responsible for about a quarter of coronavirus cases at USC. 
This data is consistent with numbers in other parts of the country, Van Orman said. Although it has not been associated with any coronavirus surges, BA.2 is beginning to become the predominant variant. 
“While we at USC and in [Los Angeles] County and the U.S. have been able to step back a lot of mitigation measures, we’re all right now in a phase of preparedness,” Van Orman said.  “Whether that’s preparedness for [BA.2] or that’s preparedness for another variant.”
The school maintains its capacity to test, monitor outbreaks and monitor rates in L.A. County as a whole. 
“The challenge is we know what to do if we start to get a surge, but it’s just helping people understand that we may need to move back on some of our mitigation measures,” Van Orman said. 
Coronavirus rates continue to drop on campus. There were a total of 41 cases last week, with a positivity rate below 0.5%, even as fewer students test following the lift of the weekly surveillance testing for fully vaccinated and boosted individuals March 1. 
All students are required to take a PCR test after returning from spring break. As of Tuesday, Student Health has conducted nearly 7,000 PCR tests for students back on campus. It is required that all students test before Saturday or they will be unable to access campus Monday. The school anticipates an increase in positive cases this week, although it is too early to see positivity rates following spring break. The required PCR tests this week are intended to catch any travel-related cases. 
Students who have tested positive for coronavirus in the last 90 days do not need to take a PCR test, although they can pick up an antigen test from booths around campus. The University will not track antigen tests because they do not show up persistently positive as PCR tests. 
Van Orman said the majority of the positive cases on campus are coming from symptomatic students. 
“It’s just a good reminder to people that the first thing you should do if you develop any kind of symptoms is to get tested,” Van Orman said. 
Additionally, many students may return from spring break with other viral illnesses, Van Orman said. The University has seen “a number” of influenza cases and other respiratory viruses. 
“Just because you have a virus doesn’t mean it’s COVID, but we really want people to get tested to exclude COVID,” Van Orman said. 
Van Orman said it is still ideal for students to stay home if they feel unwell, even if they test negative for the coronavirus. 
“We are [currently at the end of flu season],” Van Orman said. “[However,] the flu can have an extended period. Flu has behaved differently during the time of COVID because of the change in people’s behaviors, so it is still possible for students to be catching the flu.”
There are currently no plans to change Trojan Check or mask policies, Van Orman said. Mask policies must stay in adherence with the county and the regulation will only change if it does within L.A. County. The University is currently monitoring post-spring break positivity rates, specifically BA.2 rates, within the surrounding community. Testing will also continue to be optional, although if rates do increase, the University may require students to test again.
“We’re trying to balance it,” Van Orman said. “We don’t want students to have to do more than is needed, but we also want to make sure that we’re able to keep the very low case numbers within L.A. County.”

Students, members of the press and on-campus political organizations gathered in Bovard Auditorium Tuesday to watch the top five candidates for Mayor of Los Angeles debate on pressing issues, including homelessness, late-stage coronavirus responses and affordable housing. 
The candidates in attendance were Congresswoman Karen Bass, L.A. City Councilmembers Kevin De Leon and Joe Buscaino, City Attorney Mike Feuer and real estate developer and chair of the USC Board of Trustees Rick Caruso. The debate was moderated by Los Angeles Times columnist Erika Smith and FOX 11 anchor Elex Michaelson. 
Leading up to the debate, event organizers and student volunteers manned tables outside Bovard, checking in audience members and the press, while others escorted media to designated pressrooms.
Debate volunteer Ara Yacubian, said he finds the debate an opportunity for students to see first hand how the political system works and how they can be a part of it. 
“It’s important [to] tell students that these candidates are here — they want to listen to you,” said Yacubian, a senior majoring in political science and international relations. “The fact that USC is hosting it, the fact that students are staffing the event, the fact that we have single candidates that are polling well on the stage means that they want to hear from us.”
Chloe Hirth, a junior majoring in political science, communications and public policy, asked the mayoral candidates a question about their tangible actions to make the city more equitable for Angelenos, with most candidates mentioning family income and funding disparities within different areas of the city. 
“Across the board, whoever wins [the election is] going to have to work with other people … It’s really important to me to hear about those tangible action items, as well as how they’re going to make those work on both sides of the aisle,” said Hirth after the debate.
Some of the candidates employ current students as their interns, such as Edith Saucedo, a junior majoring in political science who works on De Leon’s campaign. She said she was excited to see De Leon talk about issues particular to students of color during the debate, and said she believes that, for USC students, having more representation in government is really important. 
“As a person of color, I feel like he does represent the minority,” Saucedo said. “I’m just excited for what he has to say. I’ve worked on his team, and I’ve been inspired by his message.”
During the debate, De Leon highlighted how he is running for mayor for the working people of L.A. — specifically reaching out to women of color and mothers, calling them “the backbone” of the city. 
“Without you, the city would crumble,” De Leon said. “That is why I am running for each and everyone of you, not the wealthy or elites, but the working people.”
De Leon claims he has created more housing than any of the other candidates, helping to build one of the largest tiny home villages in the nation, Arroyo Seco Tiny Home Village.
Like many candidates, he plans to expand the number of housing units built. De Leon’s specific plan is “25×25”— constructing 25,000 livable units by 2025. 
Bass, Feuer and Caruso’s homelessness platforms all include declaring a state of emergency on their first days in office. Bass additionally plans to hire a “housing chief.” Both Bass and Feuer also plan to collaborate with the private sector to expedite building and find temporary housing while shelters are being built. Caruso championed his homelessness plan as “comprehensive” and encouraged debate viewers to look it up on his website.
Councilmember Buscaino’s plan includes legislation against homeless encampments on L.A. streets, mentioning during the debate the need for a “no-camping law that has teeth.” This would include introducing a policy where an unhoused individual would be given three opportunities to opt into a city-provided bed before facing forced relocation. Congresswoman Bass pushed back and said she does not believe criminalizing poverty is a solution when many unhoused individuals have health conditions, including mental illnesses, that hinder people from making the choice to opt in. 
“I’ve actually called on the state to reform mental health,” said Buscaino in an interview with the Daily Trojan following the debate. “You have to give people options and give choices, because the sidewalk should not be available when a safer place is available for them.”
Debate attendee Minji Kang, a junior majoring in political science and communication, said she went into the debate hoping to see a candidate who will “actually support the change of L.A.,” rather than just make “empty promises.” Although Kang works on and supports De Leon’s campaign, she said some of Bass’s comments stood out to her.
“I would have to say Karen Bass’ comments on working with the president everyday definitely had some sway in the public, and I definitely see the appeal of a very strong Congresswomen making change in L.A.,” Kang said. 
Kang said she believes high rent, unemployment and public safety are the issues most pressing for USC students and that although students may feel “doomed” about the future of L.A., they should feel hopeful at the same time. 
The candidates’ stances on public safety varied, as De Leon highlighted the importance of using current police funding more efficiently, while candidates such as Buscaino, Feuer and Caruso said they look to expand the police force. Bass said she aims to increase the number of officers on the street but replace desk positions with civilians. All candidates said they plan to implement some level of mental health assistance in addition to changes to LAPD, with De Leon, Bass and Caruso wanting to implement mental health professionals and caseworkers. 
During the debate, Feuer recalled a story his father told him, which encouraged him to live a life of service. In an interview with the Daily Trojan after the debate, Feuer spoke about his involvement in drafting the same-day voter registration law, which allows last-minute voters to vote immediately after registering. To Feuer, there is nothing more important than inspiring young people to engage in work that they deem important.
“[The debate is] an opportunity, I think, for young voters to understand the possibility that their individual talent can change the world,” Feuer said.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual violence and stalking.
As the guinea pigs of the internet, Generation Z is the first to be raised on social media, and we have stumbled quite a bit through this new territory. With rather unrestricted access to the internet, we have been at odds with barrages of media — including the growth of the sex positivity movement in our adolescence which has created harmful effects.
With more and more Gen Z women vocalizing their uncomfortable and traumatic teenage experiences following influences from online sex positivity, it has become clear that this is a problem that is much larger than anyone anticipated. As Instagram account @lalalaletmeexplain, an anonymous sex and dating advice account, explains in an article from The Guardian by Gaby Hinsliff, “​​While women who enjoy rough sex have an absolute right to pursue it without shame … the normalisation of pain in porn may provide cover for some abusive men, and make women feel prudish for refusing potentially dangerous acts like choking.”
The internet brought forth a never before seen trend of sex positivity aesthetics and mantras. Campaigns of “reclaiming and embracing your sexuality” allured an entire generation to follow along blindly with an incredibly naive idea of what “reclaiming sexuality” meant.
Even if well-intentioned, some aspects of sex positivity perpetuates distorted sexual ideals to minors. 
Instead of comprehensive sexual education, we ended up on the opposite extreme — encouraging potentially dangerous sexual images and ideas despite pain to the younger generation. As @lalalaletmeexplain said, “Sexual liberation is great, but in some ways we ran with that, and then ended up in a model of sex that has been created by men.”
While social media platforms began to censor explicit content in an effort to combat distorted ideals and issue of child pornography, the widespread content censorship came with an unexpected response: a movement to embrace one’s sexuality further. This message proved extremely harmful to the young women of this generation, some, who have shared on TikTok, participating in Tumblr sex blogs at a young age that compromised their emotional and physical safety by consenting to things they might have not been completely comfortable with that they encountered online. 
Planned Parenthood reports that less than half of high schools in the United States teach comprehensive sexual education. This, along with an incredibly limited understanding of all things in the sexual realm, teenagers turned to their newest outlet — the internet — for guidance. Though it can be a wonderful resource, it also doubles as a cesspool that breeds misinformation and half-baked concepts — one being the glamorization of sex work.
Opinions on the acceptability of sex work vary from person to person, but one aspect of the job that should be intuitive is that sex workers should not face violence or the threat of violence simply because of their occupation. According to MIC writer Jenny Kutner, “A study from the Urban Justice Center’s Sex Workers Project found 46% of sex workers experienced violence in the course of their work.”
Though sex positivity has made strides in battling the stigma that accompanies those that work in the sex industry, it has simultaneously forgotten the risks associated with a job in sex work. 
A resurgence in this thinking has made its way onto TikTok as I have seen countless young women post about their nearly overnight success working in a strip club or by starting an OnlyFans. Short videos that showcase the tantalizing prospect of making hundreds of dollars a night go viral and the subsequent videos with the creator’s disclaimer of the violence and stalking they experience are shadowbanned by the platform. 
As I was growing up, I would often hear the phrase, “If school doesn’t work out, I can always drop out and become a stripper.” 
Even though this was usually said in a light-hearted manner, it is indicative of the idea that this job is easy, safe and ignores the many issues sex workers face on a day to day basis. This not only halts the discussion of the issues within the sex industry but also glamorizes a job to a younger generation that are unaware of the nuances behind such issues.
Despite the online sex positivity movement being a well-intentioned effort to free women from the constraints of slut-shaming and patriarchal double standards, it is ultimately flawed; it has left a scar on Gen Z women and left many with regrets and traumatic experiences to work through. With this in mind, it is that much more important to not only prevent this kind of media from being cycled through again but to also emphasize the importance of physical and emotional sexual education for adolescents.

When you take a walk at USC Village, you’ll immediately see an assortment of boutiques, restaurants, salons and shops. You’ll see students lined up waiting to get CAVA — a fan favorite — and doing their weekly grocery run. Just this past year, USC Village revamped a few stores and decided to include Lululemon, an exciting addition. Although, this might not be as exciting as it sounds. 
USC’s beloved nickname — “The University of Spoiled Children” — reflects a truth that runs deeply while simultaneously ignoring the realities of so many. When it comes to the demographics of USC students, financial circumstances vary, but seems the school doesn’t always recognize this.
Despite USC’s expenses, its financial aid opportunities and world-renowned education draw students from all socioeconomic backgrounds, creating a unique dynamic of split experiences.
Although wealth isn’t a necessity to fit in at USC, it certainly bolsters a student’s experiences and self-confidence with the fashion on campus making this quite visible. It takes one walk through campus to see what’s in style, and it usually isn’t cheap. From athleisure brands, such as Madhappy, Lululemon and Alo, to shoes like Golden Gooses and Jordans, designer brands and famous names tend to dominate USC trends.
Objectively, there is nothing wrong with supporting or wearing these brands; however, what is most interesting is the way the University itself has chosen to play into the expensive aesthetic of its students. USC Village was built in 2017 to house USC students while providing restaurants and amenities to students and the neighboring community. Just this past year, USC Village added a Lululemon store, one of the few places to buy clothing in the USC Village.
One pair of pants at Lululemon cost nearly $100. For a student working 15 hours a week for a total of $15 an hour, this would cost nearly half of their weekly income. 
The issues begin when we take a step back to examine the demographics of students who lack the ability to afford a USC lifestyle.
The issue is not the Lululemon itself but rather the message sent to students who do not have the disposable income to spend on expensive brand-name clothing often sported by wealthy students. For a student struggling to afford meals and pay student loans, there is already enough financial pressure alone. 
The issue doesn’t stop at fashion. The lifestyle at USC is not cheap. But clothing can be the most personal and intimate form of self-expression when students go to class and feel they are judged for what they wear or don’t have the resources to compete with wealthy students.
By putting a Lululemon as one of the sole clothing retailers in the USC Village, USC shares its support for a wealthy aesthetic and tendency to prefer the students who provide the most profit. USC is already an academically, socially and financially competitive university, making feelings of isolation more than common for students. There needs to be a stronger emphasis on student well-being and inclusivity in an area built to support USC students and the South Central community, whether it be a clothing donation center or affordable clothing. Rather than tone-deaf choices, USC Village should serve the entire student body and surrounding community. 
The University needs to embrace socioeconomic diversity when they send messages to the students they are supposed to support. Whether it be an assortment of options, better-paying work-study or an effort to reduce living costs for those who can not afford the school, it is important the University be a welcoming place for those of all socioeconomic statuses. A student who needs to provide for themself is already facing an intensified level of hardship and every message, no matter how discreet, matters.

With school back in session, albums that dropped over spring break are at risk of flying under the radar. Here are some projects released during the break that you won’t want to miss.
“Candydrip” by Lucky Daye, released March 10
His first studio album since 2019’s “Painted,” New Orleans artist Lucky Daye released “Candydrip,” which featured three artists: Lil Durk, Smino and Chiiild. The 17-track, hour-long album presents a mix of R&B and pop music, with much of the album’s bright sound giving feel-good vibes all around. The album also offers some mellow songs sprinkled into the tracklist, rounding the project out in a more complete way than his previous releases. The 36-year-old puts all of his talents on display, with his especially notable falsetto in the groovy “Feels Like” and other moments of strong vocal performance throughout the album.
“7220” by Lil Durk, released March 11
Chicago rapper Lil Durk released his first project of 2022, and his first solo project since 2020, containing 17 tracks over a runtime of 45 minutes. While Durk tries to experiment with new sounds and collaborations, evident on “Broadway Girls,” featuring country singer Morgan Wallen, much of this album’s content is relatively similar. Along with Wallen, Durk has brought a wealth of stars to hop on the album, with Future, Gunna and Summer Walker all making appearances. While Durk is one of hip-hop’s current powerhouses, much of his work seems to fall back on the same thing, his melodic flow behind a harsh and heavy drill beat. To be fair, that reliance isn’t necessarily a bad thing, as he does it well. “7220” is a decent project with some tracks to revisit like “Petty Too,” “AHHH HA” and “Golden Child.”
“Tana Talk 4” by Benny the Butcher, released March 11
The rapper from Buffalo, N.Y., dropped the fourth edition of his “Tana Talk” series on March 11, his first project of 2022. An artist from the Griselda collective, Benny features former Griselda member Conway the Machine and current Griselda member Westside Gunn on the 12-track album. Legendary hip-hop mogul Diddy and one of the biggest stars in rap, J. Cole, also contributed standout verses to the project. The veteran rapper uses his verbal prowess to express detailed recounts of his experiences through each of his songs. Much of the album uses jazz-like beats, creating an intricate stage for Benny’s words to flow over. His wordplay, rhythm, instrumentals and strong features make this a consistently great album throughout.
“HDIGH” by Dave East, released March 11
The New York native returns with a new project titled “HDIGH,” an abbreviation for “How Did I Get Here?” — a question that which the album focuses on. East meditates on his life growing up in the bustling city. With a shorter run time than average, the 9-track album totals to only 34 minutes, but East uses it well. With notable features from Method Man, Musiq Soulchild and Benny the Butcher, Dave East analyzes his lifestyle and comments on how he portrays and carries himself. While it may not be his best work to date, the album, with his nonchalant yet hard-hitting style, shows enough care and detail to be enjoyable throughout.
“Pier Pressure” by ArrDee, released March 11
Following his breakthrough verse in the popular “Body (Remix)” by Russ Millions and Tion Wayne, rapper ArrDee released his debut album last Friday. The Brighton-born artist is one of the hottest prospects coming out of the U.K. drill wave, and along with the mega-hit “Body,” he includes his own hit single, “Oliver Twist,” on the album. ArrDee also recruited fellow big-name U.K. artist Aitch to hop on the track “War.” Like many debuts, the album focuses on his newfound celebrity lifestyle and popularity, all done over drill beats. There are also a few new standouts in the album, such as “Come and Go” and “Early Hours.” ArrDee’s main goal seems to be to create another hit with these songs, but as a collection, the one-note style and theme can get a bit redundant. Still, it’s a good first album for the 19-year old Brit as he looks to establish himself in the U.K. hip-hop scene.
“Motomami” by Rosalía, released March 11
Rosalía dropped her third album three and a half years after the release of her sophomore album, “El Mal Querer” in 2018. With just two features on the tracklist, The Weeknd and Tokischa, most of the album focuses on Rosalía’s talents and artistic vision — and they don’t disappoint. The Spanish artist willingly experiments with different genres, with a very apparent flamenco influence as well as pop and reggaeton throughout. The 29-year-old also experiments with her production, using autotune and distorted instrumentals in a variety of songs. There are different moods and intentions in her songs, with some light-hearted moments like “CHICKEN TERIYAKI” or more serious and heartfelt songs such as “G3 N15.” Rosalía’s amazing vocal talent, mixed with her creativity and vision, make this album one of the best to come out in 2022.

Personally, I can’t do most true crime. Even just talking about blood and murder makes me nauseous — flashback to laying down in the backseat with my eyes closed because my sister and mom insisted on listening to true crime podcasts the entirety of our eight-hour road trip last summer. Don’t even try to recommend “Serial” or “My Favorite Murder” to me — I’m weak, I can’t do it. 
Despite true crime’s ethically-murky portrayal (and possible exploitation) of victims’ stories, it is an increasingly popular genre. There’s always a new docuseries to watch on Netflix and Hulu. Golden Globe nominee “Only Murders in the Building” even takes a dig at those obsessed with the genre. 
While I often miss out on the latest and greatest true crime documentaries, I make an exception for one special type of true crime: scammers and scandals.
The summer post-Fyre Festival was like a feast for me — unlike for the people at the festival who were given untoasted bread and cheese — I was eating up every movie and article on the topic that I could get my hands on. 
We just got “Inventing Anna,” which I similarly devoured. Anna (Julia Garner) may not have time for you, but I certainly had enough time to ignore my midterms to watch her antics. I already knew the Anna Delvey story, and the show itself was almost embarrassing to watch, yet I watched it and the subsequent YouTube videos on what the show got right and wrong. 
However, Delvey doesn’t hold a candle to the true celebrity of scandals: the one and only Elizabeth Holmes. From award-winning podcasts to HBO documentaries and a future Jennifer Lawrence-led feature film, there seems to be no end to the Holmes content. Amanda Seyfried herself is getting involved in the action in Hulu’s “The Dropout”. 
“The Dropout” is the newest addition to the Theranos-themed media collection. The mini-series follows the same story detailed in the book, podcast and documentary, but people continue to watch. Hundreds of tweets come out hourly about the show even days after that week’s episode. 
What makes Holmes’ story so much more compelling than other scandals?
After a few articles, the Anna Delvey content gets a bit repetitive, and I haven’t heard anything about the Fyre Festival for months. Yet, each new piece of media that comes out about Holmes is filled with as much passion as back in 2015 when the scandal first blew up. 
On a superficial level, it’s a juicy scandal. Past that, there is a level of satisfaction ingrained in her story. Many of the major tech conglomerates of Silicon Valley continue to grow in power and wealth with little to no oversight.
It is well known that Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook are no strangers to scandals and criticisms, with Zuckerberg even having to testify in front of Congress. Movies such as director David Fincher’s “The Social Network” expose the ugly side of Zuckerberg and the creation of the company. However, Zuckerberg is still the CEO of Meta and a multi-billionaire. 
I’m not anti-Silicon Valley. It’s where I grew up, and I love a lot of the tech that has come from it. I am constantly on Instagram, and over spring break, I even went to the new Facebook offices to try the new coffee shop (very expensive and disappointing, do not recommend). However, the lack of accountability for the corporations is disheartening. 
What’s unique about Holmes and the now-defunct Theranos is that they were actually met with consequences for their actions — she’s facing 20 years in prison. 
Theranos and Holmes were the shining stars of the Valley. The technology of Theranos was going to change the world and make tons of money. Holmes was hailed as the “next Steve Jobs” and was awarded Entrepreneur of the Year at Glamour’s Women of the Year awards. She had Rupert Murdoch and Larry Ellison on her side — she should have been untouchable. Not to mention, Holmes is wealthy and white, making her a part of a demographic that is less likely to go to prison. 
The outcome of the scandal isn’t perfect by any means. Most of what Holmes is being charged with involves wealthy investors. The patients that were exploited for results and lied to are still waiting for justice. Also, although Holmes will get prison time eventually, for now, she is still living in her 135 million dollar mansion. Still, the case of Theranos and Holmes is comforting, as it shows that there are possible repercussions to fraud in what seems like an unregulated industry.

One day, USC alumnus Alex Park was driving down West Adams Boulevard when he saw something that caught his eye: a collection of signs outside a prop store. “Love, love, love,” the signs read.
Park immediately called his boss, musician Allen Sovory, and told him about the signs. The two were working on an event together, and the love signs were the perfect prop. The shop Park spotted was Nick Metropolis Collectible Furniture, owned and operated by its namesake, Nick Metropolis.
Growing up, Metropolis, 76, wanted to be a priest, a vet and a rockstar. But ultimately, he became a collector of incredible antiques. Now, with his Martin Short-esque demeanor and spiky magenta hair, Metropolis is starting over. At his new West Adams location, he hopes to reengage with the community and spread his gospel of love and kindness.
Metropolis, the child of Greek immigrants, spent his youth in Rochester, N.Y. and at age 19, moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a music career. He wanted to be like Bob Dylan or one of the Beatles. 
“I resemble George Harrison,” Metropolis said, with his broad smile and kind eyes reminiscent of the youngest Beatles. Within a week of being in L.A., he landed a job at ABC.
“I did camera blocking for the Rolling Stones,” Metropolis said. “I was there at every Sonny and Cher recording session. I met Boris Karloff singing ‘Monster Mash.’ One of the Kinks came into my humble little apartment for a party.”
After that, Metropolis dabbled in acting, and from there, he began selling his collectibles: signs, old Hollywood props, furniture and other tchotchkes. At first, he sold his wares on street corners.
Then, in the late 1980s, Metropolis started selling out of his mechanic’s parking lot. For five years, he spent the weekdays scavenging, and on the weekends, he would show up at the mechanic’s with five 15-foot trucks full of his collectibles. Once the mechanic had closed for the weekend, he would unload all his wares. 
When Hollywood tour buses passed by Metropolis’ makeshift business, the guide would tell tourists, “You are now looking at the biggest garage sale in the world,” Metropolis said.
On Sunday nights, after he was done selling, Metropolis lugged the leftover furniture to five different storage units all over the city.
After five years, a corner shop on La Brea and 1st Street became available, and that’s when Metropolis officially opened Nick Metropolis Collectible Furniture. 
During the La Brea years, Metropolis’ store became an L.A. landmark. Celebrity and pedestrian collided at the shop, smashed together by Metropolis’ quirky Hollywood glamor. He would feed unhoused Vietnam War veterans in the same place that Lana Del Rey and Miley Cyrus would shop, Metropolis said. 
Despite his renown, running the La Brea shop was never easy. He would ring up relatives on the East Coast, begging for money to keep his shop afloat. He tried different business ventures; when a producer pitched a reality show, Metropolis filmed a sizzle reel. The show, however, was never picked up.
In 2017 the shop was robbed, and shortly after, the rabbi who owned the building that Metropolis rented from — and who was easy with late rent — died. “He was the kindest,” Metropolis said. 
When the property came under new ownership, Metropolis’ rent shot up $8,000. The whole block was being gentrified, he said.
Metropolis was in debt, unable to keep up with the rent and without his lenient landlord. Joanna Friedman, a director who had been working on a documentary about Metropolis, put together a GoFundMe, but not even a quarter of the goal was met. Metropolis had to say goodbye to the La Brea corner that he had inhabited for 26 years.
That’s when he moved his store and himself to West Adams. With two kids at Santa Monica College, Metropolis couldn’t afford his apartment by La Brea anymore either. 
Now Metropolis is starting over, without a staff, all on his own. 
“The sad part is I’m the only one running the store because I don’t have a budget for employees,” he said.
Still, he manages to stay optimistic, dedicated to improving the lives of the people around him. Outside his storefront is a table for food and clothing donations where people can stop by to pick up what they need. Metropolis also joined the West Adams Association to combat gentrification and harmful development in the area.
Thirty percent of his sales comes from prop rentals, but he still rents for free to local churches and schools. When students from USC come in with low budgets, Metropolis also makes sure that they get what they need. “I make it happen,” Metropolis said.
Metropolis’ message of love attracts people into his life, like Park and Sovory, who are eager to help Metropolis move past this difficult period in his life.
“This is the heart of a community,” said Sovory, who became a good friend of Metropolis after hearing about the “love” signs. 
As Metropolis struggles to rebuild his business and his life, he continues to give. He makes space for all the different people in his community. He offers food and clothes outside his store. He works with people who are down on their luck. He helps students put together productions that may launch their careers. Like a vet or a priest, he improves the lives of the people around him.
Even while strapped for cash, Metropolis carries around a stack of two-dollar bills to hand out. On them he writes, “Love and kindness” and “pay it forward.”

March Madness has taken many victims this year. Teams such as Auburn, Kentucky and Baylor, who all had a great shot to win the entire tournament, saw their hopes crushed by lower seeds. 
USC’s exit, while far less dramatic, likely marks the end of the Mobley era for Trojan basketball. 
I would love to say that No. 10 seed Miami beating No. 2 seed Auburn makes USC’s loss to Miami more digestible, but rather, it is a reminder that anything can happen in March. The Trojans still have a great chance to make another run next year if they could get their offense on the same page.
In past columns, I prophesied that USC’s inconsistent offense would be their Achilles Heel this season. Against Miami, the offense made it almost impossible to win. The Trojans scored 20 points in the first half, and their stars struggled to find the basket. 
Junior guard Boogie Ellis only scored three points all game, and junior forward Isaiah Mobley didn’t show up until the second half. Mobley retreated to the perimeter against a relatively small Miami team after missing 2 free throws early in the game. 
Despite all these struggles, USC still had a chance to win down the stretch after senior guard Drew Peterson rattled in a three with 25 seconds left. Miami closed the Trojans out with 2 late free throws, winning 68-66.
This was a disappointing end to what has been a fantastic season. The Trojans won the most regular season games in 116 years of USC basketball, excelling in a year when many wrote them off after star center Evan Mobley was drafted to the Cleveland Cavaliers.
The Trojans opened with a dominant start, winning their first 13 games and rising to a No. 5 rank in the AP Poll — their first top-five ranking since the 1974-1975 season.
Stanford ended USC’s historic run after an 18-day break due to complications surrounding health and safety protocols. A couple weeks later, Stanford beat USC again, exposing major lapses in the Trojan offense — USC had 14 turnovers in this game. 
Turnovers plagued the Trojans in key games throughout the season, especially against Miami, and their high turnover numbers were a major factor in earlier losses to Oregon and Arizona as well.
USC’s record to start the season was admittedly misleading. They faced a lot of subpar teams early on and did not have to face Arizona or UCLA until Feb. 5.
USC’s mediocre performances against top teams left the selection committee unconvinced, contributing to their placement as a No. 7 seed in the NCAA Tournament. 
It wasn’t surprising USC lost to Arizona. The Wildcats are one of the best teams in the nation and have a solid chance to win it all this year. 
Even though the losses to Arizona were justifiable, USC did not build a solid resume of wins against top-tier competition. These losses against elite teams weighed heavier on their postseason seeding. 
USC ended the season ranked No. 22, the highest in 20 years.
Last week’s first round exit is a setback after an Elite Eight run last season, but there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about USC basketball’s future. 
The Trojans’ recruiting class next year ranks No. 6 in the country, and they will be getting another elite center in Vince Iwuchukwu next season. 
Overall, it was a successful season. The Trojans proved they could play as a team, win big games and rally the school behind them. I am looking forward to seeing what USC basketball has in store for next season.

The NBA playoffs are set to begin April 16, and the NBA season is moving forward into its final weeks. Around the league, former Trojans are helping their teams make a push for a spot in the postseason. 
Power forward/center Evan Mobley, Cleveland Cavaliers
The Cleveland Cavaliers currently hold the sixth spot in the Eastern Conference standings, and rookie standout Evan Mobley has been a critical component to their success this season. Mobley currently averages 15.2 points and 8.3 rebounds per game to go along with 1.7 blocks per game this season. Mobley is fifth in scoring among rookies, first in rebounding and first in blocks. His play on the defensive end is showing up in team metrics, as the Cavaliers maintain the fifth best defensive rating in the NBA this season.
On March 14, Mobley posted a career-high 30 points against the Los Angeles Clippers in a 120-111 victory. In March, Mobley averaged 17.2 points, 9 rebounds and 1.5 blocks per game over an 11-game stretch. With less than a month left in the regular season, Mobley still holds the top spot on the NBA’s Rookie Ladder. 
Center Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls
Big man Nikola Vucevic has been one of the main contributors on a team that is currently fifth in the Eastern Conference. Vucevic has been very productive at the center position, averaging a double-double with 18 points and 11.4 rebounds per game.
The Chicago Bulls acquired Vucevic in a mid-season trade last season to pair him with guard Zach Lavine. The Bulls already have 42 wins this season, after winning just 31 games last year and 22 games the year before, meaning Vucevic will likely make his fourth playoff appearance of his career.
Guard DeMar DeRozan, Chicago Bulls
DeMar DeRozan, a now five-time NBA All-Star, averages a career high 27.7 points on 50% shooting from the field to go with 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game. DeRozan leads the Bulls in scoring this year and is sixth overall in the league in scoring this season. He is coming off a 14-game stretch in February where he averaged 34.2 points per game.
Against the Toronto Raptors, DeRozan scored 26 points in a 113-99 victory over his former team, as the Bulls made progress in preserving a top-five seed in the Eastern Conference.  As the playoffs approach, DeRozan will look to build on his current form and establish the team as true contenders in the East.
Guard Kevin Porter Jr., Houston Rockets
Although the Houston Rockets currently have the worst record in the NBA, the team’s young core of players continues to show promise. Kevin Porter Jr. averages 14 points, 4.1 rebounds and 5.9 assists per game and has put on some strong performances for Houston over the month of March. He registered 29 points against the Memphis Grizzlies and 22 points against the top-seeded Miami Heat. Although Porter Jr. shoots only 39.9% from the floor this season, he holds a career high in three point percentage at 37%.
Porter Jr. is a part of a Rockets team still trying to learn how to win games, as Houston has the sixth youngest team in the NBA with an average player age of 25. The Rockets will use the final games of the season to continue developing their young talents like Porter Jr.

USC men’s swim will compete in the NCAA Championships March 23 through 26. Nine Trojan qualifiers will head to the team’s final competition of the season. 
The swimmers competing for a national title this week include graduate student Trent Pellini, redshirt senior Nikola Miljenic, senior Victor Johansson, senior Alexei Sancov, sophomore Ben Dillard, sophomore Vaggelis Makrygiannis, freshman Daniel Matheson, freshman Chris O’Grady and freshman Artem Selin. Junior Max Saunders will be joining the team in Atlanta for relays. 
“The most important thing is we did the main work first semester,” Sancov said. “We do the main block of training starting from August all the way through the end of December leading to mid-January. Then, it’s all into little details. Closer to NCAAs, we reduce intensity and yardage, but we focus on small things like turns and starts.”
O’Grady currently holds USC’s record for the 200-yard breaststroke with a 1:51.67, a record that Dillard had held earlier in the season (1:52.44). O’Grady, Dillard and Pellini will swim breaststroke this week, with Dillard competing in the 200-yard event, O’Grady competing in the 100 and 200-yard events and Pellini competing in the 100-yard event. 
The Pac-12 Championship meets earlier in March brought personal records as well as school records and proved to be a confidence booster for swimmers competing in the NCAA Championships. 
In the A-final for the 500-yard freestyle event, both Matheson and Johansson finished with NCAA qualifying times and ended in the top 10 overall. Matheson finished fifth with a 4:14.87, his new personal record, and Johansson finished seventh with a 4:16.97. Matheson went under 15 minutes in the mile swim for the first time in his swimming career, finishing fourth with a 14:51.59, over 20 seconds faster than his previous time. Johansson finished seventh overall for the Trojans with a 15:03.03. Matheson and Johansson will both be competing in the 500-yard freestyle and the 1650-yard freestyle at the NCAA meets. 
Sancov said that he looks forward to the NCAA Championships as an opportunity to showcase all of the work the team has put in this year. According to Sancov, the Trojans suffered last season because of uncertainty regarding the coronavirus pandemic, so this season has been a change of pace for the team. 
“We’ve been living in so much uncertainty,” Sancov said. “When you have no idea when you’ll be swimming, where you’ll be swimming and if you’ll be swimming at all, mentally, it’s a lot easier when you know that, for sure, tomorrow, you are going to have a practice.” 
The Trojans have welcomed this season’s increased stability. 
“Compared to last year, this year, [we are] definitely more confident, and that shows in the amount of people that qualified for NCAAs,” Sancov said. “Last year, we had two guys swim individuals, and this year we have [nine]. The difference compared with last year is going to be very, very drastic in a good way.” 
The Trojans will travel to Atlanta for the NCAA meets from March 23 to 26.
