Go girl · Social entrepreneur Elizabeth Scharpf shows an example of the sustainable menstrual pads she helped bring to women in Rwanda. – Beverly Pham | Daily Trojan
The founder of Sustainable Health Enterprises, an organization dedicated to creating business solutions for problems in the developing world, visited the USC Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab Wednesday afternoon to discuss her work in business with social impact.
Elizabeth Scharpf worked for the Clinton Foundation and the World Bank before traveling to Rwanda with two students where she discovered an urgent problem. SHE’s first initiative, SHE28, focuses on developing a sustainable supply of menstrual pads for women in developing countries without relying on donations and charity.
Without access to menstrual pads, Scharpf says women in developing countries are at a significant disadvantage in school and work. On average, 18 percent of women and girls in Rwanda miss 50 days of school or work per year because of a lack of menstrual protection.
“I was shocked,” Scharpf said. “I worked at the crosshairs of international business for years, and I had never heard of this problem. The surprise and shock turned to outrage. The problem was being overlooked because of a taboo.”
The issue was covered up in developing countries, Scharpf said, because of the sensitivity of the issue of menstruation. She said access to menstrual products will help develop women’s understanding of their own bodies. SHE developed the branding for the pads in collaboration with its customers. The logo says “go!” and is meant for working women and girls.
“We talked to 500 girls and women in Rwanda,” Scharpf said. “I was fascinated. What people really wanted was information about their bodies and themselves. There was a need for advocacy. There is something like a 20 percent tax on menstrual products in Rwanda.”
SHE is planning to roll out a franchise model in Rwanda that utilizes local and renewable raw materials, like banana fibers, to manufacture and distribute affordable menstrual pads through existing female social networks. Scharpf says this sustainable business model is of more use to women and the community as a whole in developing countries than a charitable approach.
“We built a production site, and we’re there,” Scharpf said. “It’s been such a journey. We had to build a supply chain for banana fiber. We work with over a thousand farmers. This is the largest source of income for those farmers today.”
Kyle Pham, a sophomore majoring in cognitive science and philosophy, politics and law, found Scharpf’s interactive community approach to business fascinating.
“I thought it was really cool how the business model was structured to incorporate the community and ultimately impact the community. It’s really bidirectional,” Pham said. “I’m really interested in entrepreneurship and recently launched one of my own startups. Once I have more resources I would love to dive into social entrepreneurship.”
The supply chain and production site make about 1,000 pads per day, and SHE is hoping to expand the program in the near future. The Harvard Business School, The New York Times and Bill Clinton, among others, have recognized SHE’s work for shaking up the status quo in the field of international development and aid. Student attendees were similarly inspired.
“I think the company’s impact is really meaningful, particularly with the communities SHE has reached in Africa,” said Spencer Wix, a sophomore majoring in business administration. “It’s really exciting that SHE is planning to go global.”
The event was co-sponsored by Global Brigades at Marshall, SoGal and the Trojan Scholar Society. It was moderated by Abby Fifer Mandell, the executive director of the USC Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab.
“We are a center within the Marshall School of Business, but we serve students from all across the university,” Fifer Mandell said. “We give students opportunities to use what they learn in the classroom for good. We train our students to tackle the world’s biggest problems.”
The lab will be hosting another forum in their Lunch and Learn series on Nov. 17th with the founder of Not Impossible, a company that creates tech-based solutions for vulnerable populations around the world.

Following a shooting at a community college in Oregon three weeks ago where an armed man killed 10 people and injured seven others before committing suicide, students gathered Wednesday afternoon in the Rosen Room of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center to discuss the issue of gun control in America.
The event was hosted by the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics and the Political Student Assembly as part of the California Politics Roundtable Discussion — a joint effort between the two organizations.
The discussion was moderated by Dan Schnur, director of the Unruh Institute; Sonali Seth, director of political content for the PSA and editorial director of the Daily Trojan; and Jonathan Gunn, social media marketing director for PSA. It featured Christina Bellantoni, assistant managing editor for politics at the Los Angeles Times and Alan Zarembo, projects and investigative reporter  for the L.A. Times.
Bellantoni responded to question asking if shootings similar to the one in Oregon have an affect on the political landscape. She said that in 2011, the year Republicans took office,  Gabrielle Giffords, a Democrat from Arizona, was shot at an event in her home district.
“A year later there were the shootings in Newtown. And I said, ‘This is it, people watched children get slaughtered at a school, there will be an instance where you see something happening,” she said. “If those two incidents were not going to change the political landscape at a time when the nation was struck by tragedy, then it was not going to happen.”
Since the Newtown shootings, many have observed the lack of legislation on the subject of gun control because of the divide between Democrats and Republicans on the issue.
“With the red-blue division of states, gun control is the kind of issue where these political and cultural divides play out in very real terms,” Schnur said.
The discussion also touched on the role of mental health in mass shootings.
“The problem with using the mental health argument is that there are a lot of people who are mentally disturbed in our country. Very, very few are involved in shootings,” Zarembo said. “As a strategy for bringing down shootings, addressing mental health is probably not a good idea as there much clearer things that could be done.”
Leesa Danzek, a senior majoring in political science, asked about current legislation controlling the sale of guns to criminals.
“I am not an expert on what legislation is out there,” Bellantoni said. “But I will tell you that what they’re looking at in California is having ammunition be registered and doing more background checks.”
Seth noted the discrepancy between the perception of how much crime has risen over the past couple of decades versus how much it has actually risen.
“Do you think there are any political implications of this perception that crime is rising while it may not be?” she asked.
Zarembo responded by saying the perception might come from politicians preparing for negative outcomes.
“Well, crime is not rising, overall,” Zarembo said. “I think that fear is a very powerful force in politics, and if you listen to our politicians, my impression is that we’re always on the edge of catastrophe and perhaps the media could do a better job of dialing us back to reality.”

Teach for America founder Wendy Kopp spoke at an intimate gathering of students Wednesday evening about the importance of transformative leadership in education.
Kopp, who serves as CEO of Teach for All, the global offshoot of TFA, said many schools today are ill-equipped to address the needs of the most at-risk students.
“We are sending students who we know need more to schools that have less,” she said.
The organization places college graduates in low income communities throughout the country to serve as teachers. Kopp spoke about the genesis of TFA, an idea she created for her senior thesis while at Princeton University in 1989.
Kopp said when she was in college she saw that liberal arts graduates in particular were being recruited by large investment firms offering good money and only asking for a two-year commitment, but she felt many students were taking the corporate path because of a lack of other meaningful options available to them.
“What I hoped for then, and what I still hope for, is that graduates of our most selective educational institutions can channel their energy into expanding opportunity for those most in need,” Kopp said. “The most fulfilled people I know have made the choice to be in this arena.”
Among those in attendance was former TFA teacher Avery Seretan, who is currently a second-year master’s of public policy student. Seretan continues to work at Alliance Cindy & Bill Simon Technology Academy High School in Watts, where she served during her tenure with TFA. She said she came to the event to meet Kopp but also to be a resource for students contemplating participation in TFA.
“I’m excited to see new Trojans and interact with people who are excited and passionate about education,” Seretan said.
But, in recent years, the number of USC students applying for TFA positions has declined drastically. TFA recruitment manager Chrystal Gaither said last year TFA accepted 56 applicants from USC compared to 96 applicants in 2013.
Applications and enrollment in TFA nationwide have decreased significantly in the past five years. Kopp said the organization placed 4,200 teachers across the country last year, compared to 6,000 the previous year.
Lida Jennings, executive director of TFA Los Angeles, said the decrease in applications is likely due at least in part to the economic recovery. She said applications reached a high point following the 2008 economic crisis. Currently there are 180 corps members serving as teachers in Los Angeles, which is home to the nation’s second-largest school district.
“I have requests for, and I could place 2.5 times as many teachers as we have right now,”  Jennings said.
But the program is still selective, with an average national acceptance rate of 18 percent, and the application process will not become any less competitive to respond to increased need. Jennings said recruiting the most qualified leaders and teachers is still the foremost concern of the organization, which is part of the reason she wanted to bring Kopp to USC to speak directly with students.
“Social leadership is pervasive here at USC,” said Jennings, a USC alumna who previously worked at the Marshall School of Business. “There is a deep appreciation for community at this university. We’ve hit the jackpot if we can harness these hearts and souls into long-term educational leadership.”
Adlai Wertman, professor of clinical entrepreneurship and founding director of the Brittingham Social Enterprise Lab, led the conversation with Kopp, which in part reflected on the organization’s 25th anniversary.
“We have to look at what [Kopp’s] generation did and how this generation can build on it,” Wertman said.
One student at the event is hoping to do just that. Samantha Jacobs, a senior majoring in public relations and English, was accepted into TFA and will begin her training this June for job placement in Philadelphia.
“I’m really passionate about bridging the equality gap in education, and I can’t think of a better place to start than Teach for America,” Jacobs said. “These kids need that leadership. They need that example, and they need us to take the reins.”
Lauren O’Neil, a senior majoring in business administration major, is still waiting to hear whether or not she has been accepted into the program but she said seeing Kopp speak cemented her desire to be involved in working with students.
“Seeing such an incredible founder taking time to speak with students demonstrates how important she believes we all can be and how much we can have a meaningful impact,” O’Neil said.

Graphic by Sylvie Howton ’19 | Daily Trojan.
Interacting with people can sometimes be incredibly awkward. It’s strange how something so simple can become so hard if you think about it enough.
Have you ever had that super uncomfortable struggle when you’re crossing paths with someone and neither of you know which way the other is going to go, so you both awkwardly bounce from side to side like you’re suddenly doing a defense drill for your third grade basketball team? Or that incredibly uncomfortable moment when you say goodbye to someone and then end up walking the same way?
That’s real awkward.
These moments leave us feeling uncomfortable and somewhat of a failure in the art of humans, but they are easy enough to laugh off.
If you’ve ever practiced the art of people watching on McCarthy Quad or in the campus center great pastime, I highly recommend it by the way), you’ll notice that students avoid one another all the time. It’s like everyone is trapped in his or her own little impenetrable bubble when walking around. People will do anything they can to shy away from human interaction, and it’s become so much easier for us to take this easy way out in our rapidly growing age of technology.
You look up for a moment and you realize you are the only one really looking up. Everyone is either looking at their feet or profusely texting, emailing or talking on the phone while staring into space, not taking in any of the people around them. It’s a miracle people don’t run into each other more often. 
But how come we’re so afraid of each other? Why don’t we make eye contact through the thick glass window of our cars with the stranger who lets us into their lane? How come we purposely avoid touching the barista’s hand as he or she carefully hands us back our money?
We are scared of human contact. Letting strangers into the tiniest snippet of our lives terrifies us. It’s like we think the people around us are a different species, plagued with some weird alien phenomenon or strange contagious disease – Ebola or Mono, who really knows?
I’ve noticed I too, fall into this ugly pattern at times — walking briskly so I can avoid eye contact with others even when I really have nowhere to be, or forgetting to really look someone in the eye when they tell me their name.
In high school I was in a group called Peer Support, and the concept of this group goes to correct the basic human instinct to avoid each other. We’re put into random groups with students we don’t know well, sit in a circle and talk about our deepest, darkest secrets. Sure, it sounds like an awful scene from “The Breakfast Club” or some weird ’60s hippie ritual. It’s hard to truly understand until you’re part of it, but my friends from Peer Support amaze me every day. 
They are all fearless in the art of human interactions. In Peer Support we’re able to look people in the eye and have a conversation with someone without taking out your phone. If you take a moment and really focus on the people you’re interacting with, the payoff is so much greater.
When you find yourself afraid to interact with that random kid in your math class, or when your hand habitually goes to your pocket, reaching for your phone in a moment of awkward silence with a stranger, I challenge you to perfect and fine tune your art of human interaction.
Yes, looking someone in the eye for too long could get incredibly awkward very quickly, but you may be pleasantly surprised with the people you come across. The simplest interaction with the lady standing behind you in the Starbucks line or a conversation with a friendly professor in the hallway can turn your whole day around.
And if you’re ever scared of human interaction, just remember we’re all made from the same double helixed deoxyribosenucleic acid. At least you know you have something in common.
Pretty sweet.

Putting on the brakes · During practice this week, defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox and the USC defense has put a lot of focus into slowing down the Utah offense, which leads all Pac-12 teams in red zone efficiency. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
With the Trojans hosting No. 3 Utah on Saturday, USC could have one final chance to save their season. Interim head coach Clay Helton appreciated the focus and toughness throughout practice on Wednesday, especially with the defense.
Helton made a point to focus on turnovers in practice.
“I think it’s going to be an unbelievable key in the game,” Helton said. “[It’s] something we really stressed in practice.”
Helton emphasized that the team is looking to carry the momentum it builds in practice into Saturday’s game.
Defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox made a point that Saturday’s game against the Utes will be a physical one.
“They’re a physical, physical team,” Wilcox said. “It’s going to be a brawl.”
Reflecting on the team’s performance against Notre Dame, Wilcox wanted the defense to focus on cleaning up multiple aspects of their game, like having better technique in terms of finishing on the ball.
“We have to execute overall,” Wilcox said. “Execution is a result of your preparation through the week.”
On both the offense and the defense, freshmen are continuing to make an impact on the field.
“These freshmen are really providing a spark for us,” Helton said. “We’re young but we’re extremely talented.”
Freshman cornerback Iman Marshall has impressed many, especially Wilcox, with his ability to adapt so quickly to the speed and physicality of the college game.
“He’s extremely competitive,” Wilcox said. “It’s what enabled him to play early.”
Helton also talked about how Marshall could have a bigger impact on defense so that sophomore Adoree’ Jackson can get more playing time on offense.
On the defense, linebacker Cameron Smith has been garnering national attention. Smith leads the team with 53 tackles and is grabbing attention for the Dick Butkus Award, which is awarded to the nation’s best linebacker.
Offensively, tailback Ronald Jones II has been a standout for the Trojans with his ability to complement USC’s committee of running backs this season.
“I’m actually playing more than I thought I was,” Jones said. “I’m really happy where I’m at.”
Helton mentioned after the Notre Dame game that his one regret was not getting the ball into Jones’s hands more often. For Jones, he doesn’t look at the game as his playing time and his snap count, but how the team performs as a whole.
“I just want to win at the end of the day,” Jones said.
Though he has been performing well, he knows that there are aspects of his game that he needs to work on such as  his over-the-head catching, flat routes and pass protection.
Jones joked that he was able to block well in high school because the majority of his opponents  were the same size as him.
“I knew blocking [it] was going to be a challenge,” Jones said about improving new aspects of his game.
Looking ahead to Utah, Helton has three keys for the team to focus on: stopping the run, running the ball and protecting the ball. He knows that it will be hard to contain Utah senior running back Devontae Booker, saying he’s the type of guy who will keep driving even after the defense makes initial contact.
“[He’s the] most physical runner in our conference,” Helton said. “His leg drive on contact is incredible.”
Helton also worked on limiting the number of penalties on the offense.
“Hand placement is really important for us,” Helton said.
Helton explained how the team’s key to limiting offensive penalties is becoming aware of their hand placement upon contact on the offensive line.
Even though they’re facing an undefeated Utah, the Trojans are still optimistic about their ability to battle on Saturday.
“It’ll be a great challenge for us,” Wilcox said. “But our guys will be excited to play.”
The Trojans will hold one more practice on Thursday before returning to the Coliseum on Saturday to take on the undefeated Utes.
 
 
Hand placement and being aggressive with a focus on defense is done during Spring Ball and Fall Camp, not focused on half way through the season. Players should’ve already been up to speed on technique by now.  Talent doesn’t win games when there poor performance from the coaching staff. Let’s see the coaching on defense this weekend step up their game. Got it Coach wilcox? Your schemes and poor planning have cause 3 losses this season. Don’t make it 4.

The Diving Belle · Joanna Newson’s new album, Divers, marks her return to music after four years. Tracks “Leaving the City,” “Sapokanian” and “Divers” have been released already and deal with themes such as corruption.

For an artist who has struggled with her child- and fairy-like typecast, folk singer Joanna Newsom has emerged with her new album sounding more mature than ever. Newsom, a  33-year-old singer-songwriter, has been working on her fourth album, Divers, during a new era in her life. The album, available on Oct. 23, promises to show her musical evolution alongside her continuing maturity that began with her 2010 album, Have One on Me.
The California native hasn’t only changed musically. In 2013, she married comedian Andy Samberg, introducing her to the mainstream limelight. Divers works off of this life change as a concept album loosely about time and how, ultimately, all will come to an end. With the two released singles, Newsom tackles her theme with very different sounds.
Newsom’s first single, “Sapokanikan,” begins with a ragtime sound and is soon complemented by a marching beat. The simple yet evocative music is joined by the singer’s unique vocals and complex lyrics. Newsom uses her characteristically layered lyrics and heavy references to invoke ideas of immortality and obsolescence. The title itself is a reference to a Native American tobacco settlement that stood where Greenwich Village is now. She also calls out historical instances of corruption, including political machine Tammany Hall and early 1900s New York City mayor John Purroy Mitchel, among many others. “Sapokanikan” is just further proof of Newsom’s songwriting capabilities. She battles in a field that not many are brave enough to enter. Like folk-rock singer Al Stewart, Newsom uses heavy references and historical stories to create in-depth and immersive songs that deal with everyday contemplation in a way that intrigues the listener while still relating to the listener.
Newsom leaves the saloon sound for an older, more baroque style. However, her second single, “Leaving the City,” is a throwback to her older sound. The medieval harp pattern is accompanied by electric guitar and drums. When her raw and strong vocals are added, a full sound is created with a slight metal leaning. Like her previous single, there’s a marching feel but this time, it’s as if it is into battle. The lyrics mirror that with short lines accompanied by hard rhymes.
Newsom sings, “The longer you live, the higher the rent / beneath a pale sky / beside the red barn / below the white clouds / is all we are allowed,” showing her descriptive and emotional chops. The word “allowed” is used often  to help Newsom tackle the ideas of life’s limitations. Newsom seems to be pointing to the feeling that no matter where one goes or escapes to, something is always lost.
Divers has been five years in the making, but Newsom hasn’t wasted one minute of that time. The album is shorter than normal for Newsom, but she’s maintained her labyrinthine lyrics. Even with the newfound brevity, Newsom hasn’t missed a beat in the packed meanings and sounds for each song.
Newsom worked with David Longstreth of Dirty Projectors and composer Nico Muhly, among many other talented collaborators. This wealth of musical experience and talent only made Newsom strive to new heights. Though the album is shorter — 51 minutes compared to previous albums of over two hours in length — Newsom still manages to not only assert her sound as evolved and established, but also as varied and experimental.
With Divers’ release on Friday, the Drag City artist not only presents her fourth album, but also an introduction to a Newsom who is more settled in life while still challenging herself as an artist and thinker.

As I write this, it’s Sunday morning — homework day — and the temperature has finally hit 76 degrees. Spring has, at last, reached Australia. Outside, the weather is not only bearable, but even enjoyable. Studying cooped up in the library is unjustifiable. When the weather is this nice, a tree becomes the perfect arm chair and sounds of the city blend to become white noise. The park is where I can be found on this day.
For me, escaping to the park is necessary for city survival. Luckily, Melbourne adheres enthusiastically to this standard of living, as there is certainly no shortage of green space in the city. With more than 1,200 acres of open space, green space comprises 15 percent of the city. Parks are a staple in successful urban planning as they provide the opportunity to relax as well as connect people throughout the city.
Melbourne parks are at the very center of the city’s layout — they frame public transportation and commerce locations. In fact, at any point in Melbourne, a park is almost always within walking distance. Though the amount of people visiting the spaces varies in accordance to the weather, for many going to the park remains an integral part of the day. During lunch hours specifically, free benches are virtually impossible to come by, as people flock to the nearest park for a bite.
What is particularly appealing about the green spaces in Melbourne is their upkeep. There is an unspoken level of respect for every patch of grass, as the land remains free from waste. Rather than trash, the grass is littered with different groups of people picnicking, reading, napping and just enjoying the green. Even those with dogs are extremely mindful of cleaning up after them.
The cleanliness of these parks indicates the mindset of personal responsibility in the use of government-operated spaces. There’s an unprecedented amount of respect for these parks, evident through both government mandates and community efforts. Melbourne’s affinity for parks encourages the eco-friendly behavior to maintain the environment to the highest standard.
To me, green spaces provide a sigh of relief. I have taken advantage of my time with the greenery during the months I have lived here. Though my favorite parks are the Botanical Gardens and Albert Park, I often frequent Flagstaff Gardens due to its proximity. Because jogging on the streets in Melbourne is socially unacceptable, the park is excellent for morning runs and a great spot for studying after classes.
The first week I arrived in Melbourne, I ventured to Flagstaff, bundled in sweaters, and laid down in the grass. I looked at the high rises and back to the streets with cars humming on the side of the road. The city was not still, but in that moment it felt like I was away from it all. There’s the same effect on the lawns at the University of Melbourne — I use my breaks as opportunities to sprawl out and enjoy the rare sunshine.
The parks each incorporate distinguishing features. Albert Park rests around a large lake that reflects a breathtaking view of the city. Its size is ideal for a long walk, one that friends and I have taken over the weekend as a means to get our blood flowing. The last time I was there, I saw several swans waddling around, similarly enjoying the thick green grass.
What I find incredible about the green spaces in Melbourne is the stark contrast with other city elements. With the trams, buskers playing music in the street, wild street art and all the vital elements of city life, there’s a sense of what exists in pockets of the city. The coexistence between nature and city life reflects the diversity in Melbourne, one integral to the very spirit of the city.

On Oct. 20, writer and actress Lena Dunham announced that she will be teaming up with close friend Jenna Weiss-Berman and Buzzfeed to release a podcast called Women of the Hour. Created with the purpose of delving deeper into topics such as feminism, gender and sexuality, Women of the Hour aims to empower women. With a bestselling book and a newly created email newsletter under her belt, both already touching on the same topics, one might wonder: Why a podcast?
Though podcasts have been underrated in the entertainment world, eclipsed by television and websites, they are slowly increasing in dominance. With so many platforms to choose from, the podcast is one of the only ones that can convey an authentic message through personal storytelling. It also intimately connects listeners to the host. People can remain informed and entertained without having to do much more than listen, making podcasts great for long car rides, marathon-running and practically any situation that requires multi-tasking. Ultimately, a podcast is like listening in on a really engaging discussion.
Podcasts have been pivotal in shaping the role of narrative storytelling in the constantly changing world of media. With so many podcasts to keep up with, six edge out the rest as most entertaining.
Serial
Serial is one of the most successful podcasts of all time. The first season of Serial, a nonfiction podcast focused on investigative journalism, explores the mystery behind the 1999 murder case of Hae Min Lee, an 18-year-old from Maryland. Her ex-boyfriend was charged for her murder but claimed to be innocent. It’s compelling and addictive, leaving listeners obsessed, completely enthralled and puzzled by the clues given in the story. Later this year, host Sarah Koenig will be back for season two. Though details are being kept under wraps, the second installment is set to be centered around United States Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who was held captive by a guerilla insurgent group connected to the Taliban in Afghanistan.
 
This American Life
A well-received and unique podcast hosted by the charismatic Ira Glass, This American Life mixes storytelling and reporting in its weekly program, focusing on a new topic every week. It integrates simple topics with the lives of Americans and masterfully finds meaning and depth in their personal stories. Though straightforward and informative, This American Life isn’t afraid to be a quirky and silly show as well, making it continually successful and loved by many.
Freakonomics Radio
Based on the successful books, Freakonomics Radio is a weekly podcast that discusses complicated issues in society and culture. They converse about “hidden topics” such as stories on cheating in relationships, drug-dealing children and self-dealing real estate agents. Freakonomics is unlike any other podcast — it challenges people to think differently and open their minds to controversial topics.
Not Too Deep With Grace Helbig
Grace Helbig is a YouTube sensation turned podcaster. Known for her intelligent and hilarious personality as “Online Grace” on YouTube, Helbig delivers the same  humor and creativity in Not Too Deep With Grace Helbig. An interview podcast that proclaims itself to be “silly, ridiculous and unapologetically superficial,” it is sure to entertain old fans and new listeners.
Gastropod
Gastropod is an interesting podcast that focuses on food, through a science and history perspective. It releases a new episode every month, covering topics from the science of ice cream, to the evolution of cutlery and the increasing popularity of kelp in an upbeat and fascinating manner. The hosts interview food experts and visit labs, helping listeners understand and see food in a new and fun way.
The Nerdist
The Nerdist, a series by BBC America, is a podcast on “what it means to be a nerd.” An interview podcast hosted by Chris Hardwick, Jonah Ray and Matt Mira, The Nerdist truly puts on a show revolving around comedy and entertainment. The hosts create a comfortable and conversational interview environment that allows for freedom in the dialogue for the guest, leading to more captivating stories. Past guests have included Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams  and actor Tom Hiddleston.

Set to launch in November on iTunes, Peeple is a new application that allows users to rate the people they have met. Much like how a user would rate a business on Yelp, Peeple users will be able to review others on a five-star scale. Moreover, Peeple lets users review other people based on three defined groups: professional, dating and personal. Though the app aims to foster positive social networks, the release of Peeple would still have inevitably damaging implications on self-perception and communication.
Upon the unveiling of its development, Peeple has been the target of numerous amounts of public criticism due to its potential to drive the growing issue of cyberbullying. Cases of depression and even suicide have been known consequences of cyberbullying, and many are concerned that Peeple could be the next platform for this generational epidemic of online hate.  In defense of these concerns, developers Julia Cordray and Nicole McCullough have expressed clear stances on how their new rating service is not intended to incite online bullying. “Join the positive revolution” serves as the headline for the Peeple launch website, advertising it as a safe and supportive environment.
Though Cordray and McCullough’s intentions for Peeple seem pure, their hopes for creating a positive environment are clearly delusional. Peeple serves as the ideal setting for cyberbullying, as its primary function is for people to essentially post their judgments of other people on the internet.
Developers Cordray and McCullough have responded to concerns about negative comments and have taken precautions in an attempt to stop online hate. Whereas people were previously given 48 hours to sort out negative reviews before they went public, negative commentary has been banned from the app. An individual being reviewed will be able to censor recommendations before they are aired to the public. However, different people will surely perceive reviews as positive or negative by their individual standards, which puts into question whether developer attempts at banning negative reviews are truly effective.
But despite attempts to safeguard against cyberbullying, privacy still remains a concerning ethical issue that Peeple will have to address. Though necessary precautions have been taken to filter negative and abusive commentary, some people may wish to be omitted from public scrutiny altogether. Just because someone receives positive ratings doesn’t necessarily indicate that he or she wants to be on the app at all. Any kind of interaction would essentially subject someone to being published on Peeple, thus changing the way people would have to approach daily communication.
Peeple’s presence on college campuses like USC would have dramatic implications for the way students communicate and could even exacerbate cyberbullying. The anonymous thought sharing app Yik Yak has already been a platform for cyberbullying and hate among college students. The introduction of Peeple at college campuses could very well follow in Yik Yak’s footsteps — except with Peeple, specified instead of anonymous individuals would be the target of abuse. For some, the recommendation review would be a systematic way to filter out abusive comments, but this still would not remedy the constant feeling of judgment students would face if Peeple established itself in collegiate settings.
With the introduction of Peeple, every interaction with professors and students alike could put an individual on the app’s radar. Self-perception would be viewed in an entirely different way on college campuses, as once casual interactions could determine the outcomes of Peeple reviews. Dynamics of how college students build, view and interact in various relationships will inevitably be altered by the pressure of being rated in a favorable manner.
Currently, Peeple’s release has been pushed back from the original October date to some time in November. Cordray  and McCullough have evidently heard public concerns about Peeple and made necessary changes to the app, such as giving individuals the power to review recommendations about themselves and banning negative commentary. But even with these improvements, Peeple still has a long way to go until it can truly become the positive environment it aspires to be for its users.

As student government leaders, we work with some of the most remarkable students on our campus. Together, we’ve had great successes, including advocacy work on behalf of students with disabilities, Leavey Library renovations, our mental health awareness campaign, research symposiums, concerts and more. We believe these impactful projects leave our campus better than when we came in.
Due to its inherent structure, university student governments turn over every year, which can result in the loss of institutional knowledge and a halt on momentum. This allows some goals to get swept under the rug. At times, it appears the University chooses to wait until student leaders spearheading some of the more expansive movements graduate to avoid addressing the issues.
The student community can change this by engaging with and cultivating active, energized, and thoughtful leaders who dream and think big. Bolstering opportunities for these types of students to take on leadership roles is vital to sustaining effective student activism and leadership. The younger classes can carry on the torch of many initiatives started by their more senior counterparts.
More importantly, the administration must recognize the voices of student leaders, across undergraduate and graduate, as legitimate representatives of the campus community and must be truly receptive to them. While speaking to students at meetings is a step toward progress, follow-up and action demonstrates a true commitment to the Trojan Family.
Student activism should not be feared or shut out. It must be embraced. Student activism demonstrates the ability to collaborate, analyze and think critically, all skills our faculty and staff devote their lives to instilling in us.
The word activism conjures negative imagery in some circles. In reality, activism is the action of taking a stance in order to engender change in one’s society. Simply put, activism can include actions from voicing your opinion during an in-class discussion to writing a letter to administrators asking for greener campus initiatives. Similarly, there are students at USC who believe so deeply in causes such as equity, sexual violence prevention, environmentalism, and more, that they choose to act upon their beliefs and seek change.
Some of USC’s most impactful accomplishments arose from student activism. Each of our cultural centers were established through student activism. Although there was a time when the University barred the installment of an LGBT resource center, students continued to fight. Our current LGBT Resource Center, although in need of more space and resources, makes a difference in the lives of thousands of students. This resource center would not be here today without student activism.
In the past, when students protested in the halls of an administrator’s office, they were threatened with suspension. An institution of higher education should not condemn students who challenge the status quo. It is ingrained in the mission statement of these institutions to breed minds that think critically and impact their world for the better.
We have hope for student activism because of our new provost.  Provost Quick’s no-nonsense, open and efficient leadership is admirable. His receptiveness should serve as a shining example for other administrative positions. While we appreciate the access to conversation with our provost, we need to see action from the rest of our university administration and from our Board of Trustees.
Admittedly, there are many initiatives the administration and the students have collaborated on to complete: the drop deadline, Leavey renovations, gender neutral housing and more. However, these accomplishments did not and do not happen overnight. They were the result of student activism and students advocating for change, which, at the University of Southern California in particular, takes years of persistence, and sometimes takes the culmination of a perfect storm of events to see tangible results.
One day, we envision a USC that soars to greater heights in conjunction with an active student community. However, we cannot get there until our administration becomes more receptive to student activism and willingly opens its ears to the voices of its students.

The Los Angeles Times revealed last Saturday that the number of managers and administrators in the University of California system has grown by 60 percent over the past 15 years, far more than enrollment growth at 38 percent. The disproportional rate of bureaucracy growth has sparked a debate about whether the UC system spends too much money on administration.
As more questions arise about why UC administration has increased dramatically while tuition has risen, the numbers at USC seem to be telling largely the same story — albeit on an even grander scale. As an investigation by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting recently concluded, the size of USC’s administrative employees have grown 305.8 pecent in the past 25 years. However, there is not enough data to definitively conclude how much rising tuition — which has risen 173 percent nominally over the same time period — contributes to the rising bureaucracy. And as Todd Dickey, senior vice president of administration, has argued, the data could be skewed. But when students have no other choice but to respond to the NECIR and the L.A. Times’ figures about UC administration increases, the narrative forms that California colleges — including USC — have been spending tuition on bureaucrats at a time when it claims to be cutting costs.
In light of the NECIR investigation and larger outlets’ spotlights on bureaucracy, it is surprising that the University has not released more information. And as more are considering whether bureaucracy is linked to exponentially rising tuition costs, to continue to remain opaque about how tuition dollars are allocated demonstrates the University’s deliberate lack of transparency. Moreover, it suggests that to USC, a favorable media image is more critical than students’ accessibility to essential information about an institution to which they pay one of the highest tuition rates in the nation.
That’s not to say that the 300 percent increase in administrative employees has gone completely unexplained. According to an interview with the Daily Trojan, Dickey has said that these administrative staff increases are largely due to increases in hospital staff, researchers and staff to fundraise for the University. However, USC has not released quantitative data to demonstrate how these decisions have been made.
Moreover, the University’s increased bureaucracy may not exactly be in the place that students want to it to be — the University has not paid for more officials in student services, cultural centers or academic advising, areas which could benefit from bigger staffs.
More data needs to be released to determine whether USC’s increased bureaucracy is necessary, especially considering it has cut costs in other areas. Most notably, the rise of adjunct and part-time faculty instead of full-time professors has allowed the University to minimize costs. But adjunct faculty make about $5,000 per semester. It’s a tragedy, then, that the University has hired more bureaucratic staff at the expense of giving faculty the wages they deserve.
The University’s administrative decisions do not occur in a vacuum. Students should be part of the conversation to increase the University’s staff, and they want to be part of it. More importantly, they have a financial stake in the University’s choices. It’s time for an honest conversation between administration and students about how tuition is spent.

Despite an attempt by student government leaders, the university administration has rejected a proposal this year for the implementation of a fall break. Undergraduate Student Government has tried for two consecutive years now to encourage the administration to provide students with a two-day fall break in the middle of the semester, both times failing to secure a popular vote among the faculty senate and approval from school administrators. With 96 percent of students who responded to a poll conducted by USG favoring a fall break, the response and demand is overwhelmingly clear — USC needs a fall break. Many universities, such as Yale, Princeton and Duke, already have a fall break in place. USC has the opportunity to become a model and leader in higher education and set the standard that, for the mental health and well-being of students, a fall break is appropriate.
In the current 2015-16 academic year, USC has 72 instructional days in the fall semester. In each of the next five years, it will drop to 71 instructional days in the fall semester, all without a fall break. Spring break offers a demarcation and a signal for the final stretch of the spring semester. In fall, we have no such luxury of time off. By the time Thanksgiving rolls around, finals are around the corner and students and faculty find themselves scrambling to get so much done in so little time. A fall break offers a breather and rest for students and faculty. After a long stretch of studying, exams, papers and projects, it is important to stop and take a break. For some students, classes only have one midterm and they all fall relatively at the same time. For others, the only world they know is midterms. Once they start, they don’t stop until final exams begin. With such a rigorous coursework, one can easily burn out and get lost in a seemingly never ending cycle of review sheets and study guides. It may be fall, but highlighter fluid and coffee stains aren’t really in fashion.
A fall break has so much to offer.  It offers Trojans that additional time to catch up. And it offers students time to focus on their other pursuits and possibly commit more time to recruiting processes or resume building. It’s disappointing to hear students say Los Angeles is not all that they expected or made it out to be when all they can see is as far as Adams and Hoover. USC offers Maymesters and Alternative Spring Break activities, but sorely lacks a time during the fall semester for students to put down the pencil, take off the sweatpants and expand their education beyond the classroom.
As shown in the rejection of the fall break, not everyone shares the same sentiment. Professors and faculty have expressed concern over curriculum and time in the classroom. The concerns are valid, but they fail to recognize the benefits that a fall break brings. Sometimes cramming 10 lab sessions or five to six lengthy novels doesn’t do any good. When you have four or five midterms they stop being simply midterms. They’re four or five full-fledged exams. The point is this: Adding so much in to a semester because there is little time and then rejecting time off because there is too much stress for all that needs to be done is a glaring sign that something needs to change. Schools like Yale recognized that and did something about it after repeated attempts by undergraduates. It’s time USC recognize it, and USG should not give up on its proposal.
The extra two days off may seem small, but they offer a glimmer of hope that many students need. USG President Rini Sampath has spearheaded mental health as a major issue on campus and a fall break would champion that fight to help students who are struggling under so much pressure. With so many midterm examinations, essays, papers, extracurriculars, and all the other stress that comes with collegiate life, it’s important the university demonstrates it cares about students and their success. It doesn’t help anyone when you completely pack a schedule, increase stress and end up with students faltering. You don’t learn, and it reflects poorly on everyone involved. Seventy-two instructional days. Seventy-one days. Sometimes, it’s not about the quantity, it’s about the quality.

The Trojans battled hard on the road against No. 14 Notre Dame but came up just short. In the end, the Trojans were simply outcoached.
After scoring 24 first half points, the Trojans managed only seven points in the second half, while being outscored 17-0 in the fourth quarter. Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly made the necessary halftime adjustments for his team to win, while interim head coach Clay Helton failed to do so.
The Trojans have been plagued with poor game management and in-game adjustments since Pete Carroll’s departure in 2010. The Trojans got it wrong with the hiring of both Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian, as each of their tenures ended in dramatic fashion.
Now looking for their third permanent head coach since 2010, the Trojans cannot afford to get it wrong again.
Finding a good head coach can be difficult. Just ask Michigan.
Up until this year, the Wolverines had been stuck in middle tier purgatory since Lloyd Carr’s retirement in 2007. The Wolverines went with a young coach who had promise (Rich Rodriguez) and then with a coach with more experience (Brady Hoke). Unfortunately for Michigan neither coach worked out.
Now Jim Harbaugh has a team, which went 5-7 last season, off to  5-2 start — which should have been 6-1 if not for a miracle play by Michigan State — and in the midst of the Big 10 race. Coaching matters.
The effects of a bad coach are felt both on and off the field. During Hoke’s last two seasons at Michigan, the Wolverines only managed the 20th and 37th best recruiting classes in the nation, according to 247Sports. Harbaugh already has Michigan’s 2016 class at No. 9. Coaching matters.
On the opposite end of the spectrum, we have Ohio State. After Jim Tressel’s sudden resignation after the Terrell Pryror bribery scandal, the Buckeyes moved swiftly and hired one of the best coaches in college football — Urban Meyer. There was no layover for the Buckeyes as they continued their dominance in the Big 10.
The Buckeyes have gone 45-3 with a national championship in the three plus years under Meyer. The Buckeyes have also had a top 10 recruiting class every year under Meyer. Coaching matters.
Unfortunately for the Trojans, there are only a few elite coaches in college football — Nick Saban, Urban Meyer, Jimbo Fisher — and prying them away from their current school would be damn near impossible.
However, the Trojans have passed up some pretty good coaches including Chris Peterson in favor of the Pete Carroll coaching tree during their past two head coaching searches. This kind of decision-making must stop now.
As last season’s recruiting class shows, the Trojans can recruit the best of the best. Players want to don the cardinal and gold for two reasons: the history and tradition, and the fact that USC student-athletes often find themselves playing on Sundays.
Heck, the Trojans are even three-point favorites over No. 3 Utah despite the fact they are 1-3 in games not against Arkansas State and Idaho.
The Trojans have survived over the past few years with the help of the limelight from the Carroll era. Players like JuJu Smith-Schuster, Adoree’ Jackson and Marqise Lee grew up idolizing the likes of Matt Leinart, Reggie Bush and Lendale White.
Regrettably, the Trojans are faced with a harsh reality: The last time they won a championship was more than 10 years ago.  The last time they won the Pac-12 was 2008. The team can no longer sell players on the past. Instead, they must focus on the present.
USC’s next coaching decision could determine the next five to 10 years. A great hire will keep the Trojans competitive and exciting, but another bust could see the Trojans fall into the same hole that Michigan did.
Fortunately for USC, the job is extremely appealing. A new coach will get another year out of Adoree’, JuJu and — wishfully thinking — Su’a Cravens. The freshmen will be another year older, and there will be no NCAA sanctions on the program. The Trojans head coaching job looks much better now than it did when Kiffin took over with a two year postseason ban — and when Sarkisian took over in the last year of scholarship reductions.
The Trojans are loaded on both sides of the ball, have some of the best freshmen in the country and are a national powerhouse. All the pieces are there for USC to bring in a big name. Now all they have to do is make sure they don’t mess up again.
After all, as we’ve all seen over the past five years: coaching matters.

I agree with your assessment about the O-line coach being a washed up has been from OK State, but our O-line guys aren’t as big as the kids at Stanford, Ohio State, etc…..  The O-line kids must be bigger and faster than the opposing D-lines. Of course our kids can play better, but their body types are not as fit as the O-line for ND, Stanford, tOSU, etc…
Recruiting star skill players is one thing, which has been done, while completely neglecting the defrn $e and offensive linemen needed to execute the offense. The big man recruits are not there. 
The big men recruits are there on offense with no line coach to help them improve. Losing Drevno to Michigan and getting a washed up  coach from Okla. St. has made the difference in a lack luster performance thus far in the season. The previous two head coaches were all about receivers first, and a lot less about the defensive backs.

On Saturday, the USC women’s rowing team will compete in the 2015 Head of the American Regatta, in Gold River, California.
The one-day event hosted by the Sacramento State Aquatic Center will take place on Lake Natoma at the Nimbus Flats State Park.
The 5,000-meter course starts just south of Rainbow Bridge and continues down to the finish line situated near the Nimbus Dam. Competitions range from the junior-level to the elite-level.
The Head of the American Regatta is the Women of Troy’s second rowing competition of the season.
The first was last week’s renowned 51st annual Head of the Charles Regatta in Boston. It featured two days of intense competition among teams from all over the globe including the U.S. National team and a couple of German national boats.
In its first appearance since 2003, the women’s rowing team came home with a respectable 17th place finish (with a time of 17:06.610) in the Women’s Championship eights, which featured 32 boats.
This weekend, the Women of Troy will represent USC in Women’s Collegiate twos (Event 21), fours (Event 47) and eights (Event 39) events. The 10:45 a.m. twos race will feature two USC boats among a strong line-up of Stanford, Loyola, Berkeley, Chico  and University of Washington. Later, the Women of Troy will participate in the 1:45 p.m. eights event.
In it, they will battle for first place against Chico, Loyola, Mills, Sacramento State, Saint Mary’s, UC Davis, Berkeley, Washington and reigning champion, Stanford.
Finally, at 3 p.m., three USC boats will take part in the fours event, which will include Berkeley, UC Davis, Saint Mary’s and Mills College.
Last year, Stanford took home the gold, with a time of 17:56.0, in an eights competition that did not feature USC. In their quest to dethrone Stanford, the Women of Troy will have to watch out for Berkeley. Cal placed first at last week’s eights in the Head of the Charles Regatta, besting USC’s seventeenth place effort by over a minute.
Conversely, the Women of Troy will have to do their best to avoid getting upset in the twos and fours events, which they swept in 2014, with times of 20:02.0 and 18:51.0, respectively.
The Head of the American marks the last competition of the calendar year for the USC women’s rowing team, who is led by 14th-year head coach Zenon Babraj.
The Women of Troy’s next official meet will be the 2016 Longhorn Invitational in Austin, Texas, on March 25-26.

Making a splash · The men’s swimming and diving team improved to 3-0 on the season after its victory over Hawaii last weekend at home. – Mariya Dondonyan | Daily Trojan
The men’s and women’s swimming teams have an opportunity to gain momentum and confidence early in the season this weekend, when women’s swimming (2-1)  faces Oregon State  and No. 11 men’s swimming (3-0) takes on Cal State Bakersfield this Friday.
The men are coming off a home opening win over Hawaii with a dominating 217-108.5 showing. USC started off strongly by winning the 400y medley relay. In addition, Junior Michael Domagala  won two events, the 100y free and the 200 IM.
The Trojans’ dominance continued with a pair of sweeps. USC swimmers came in first, second and third place in both the 200y back as well as the 200y breast. The 200y free relay team  finished out the meet with a win as well.
The Women of Troy also defeated  Hawaii 253-79, but fell to North Carolina State 190-144 last Saturday. Swimmers Chelsea Chenault, Anika Apostalon and Riley Scott each won events. Apostalon earned a NCAA “B” cut time in the 100y free, and Scott earned one in the 200y breast.
Chenault herself is coming off a win in the 500y free last weekend. She has found herself in a leadership position on the team this year, as many upperclassmen are redshirting this semester.
“I’ve had to step up more as a leader,” she said. “It’s huge for me to step in and help out because there are a lot of underclassmen on this team.”
This inexperience served as a weakness last week when the Women of Troy lost to NC State, according to coach Dave Salo.
“We have 13 freshman women, which is a huge class. They are learning what collegiate swimming is all about,” Salo said. “I don’t think I prepared them mentally for NC State.”
Given that the team is young, there is much to improve on after the loss to the Wolfpack, Salo said.
“We identified weaknesses last week on walls and turns,” Salo said. “They are sloppy and slow and not as strong as they could have been.”
Though midterm season poses another challenge to the men’s and women’s swim teams, Salo has been able to keep them focused.
“It’s a tough time with midterms,” Salo said. “The team is tired with training; their focus is hampered at times, but it’s part of my job to bark at them and get them back.”
Nonetheless, Salo’s system ensures that the team and each swimmer is  growing every week.
“We are looking at personal improvements over the season so far,” he said. “We want to see improvements in competition and focus and effort the following week.”
The Oregon State Beavers  are struggling this year with a current record of 0-4. Their last match resulted in a 91-140 loss to Vanderbilt. Nonetheless, Chenault does not underestimate them.
“They are a good team,” Chenault said. “We race them every year. We know what they have. We are growing each week. They are a capable team though, and its gonna be a really good meet.”
Though CSU Bakersfield started out the season with a loss to Grand Canyon, their swimmers gained some momentum last weekend at the Malibu invitational.
Salo said that the Runners have some good pieces, but he is confident that the men’s team will win Friday.
“Bakersfield is a strong mid major and our guys are weak right now because some guys are sitting out for Olympics, but we’ve got a strong, good squad,” Salo  said.
This weekend will be a test of how both the men’s and women’s teams have improved. Both matches are at 2 p.m. in the Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Friday.

Big time player · Freshman cornerback Iman Marshall committed to USC as a five-star recruit last Feburary out of Long Beach Poly High School, which is also the alma mater of star wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
Halfway through his first season at USC, cornerback Iman “Biggie” Marshall has learned that there are things in college football that are going to be out of his control.
After a shocking head coaching change and being on the losing end of a few meaningful catches this season, Marshall has embraced the one thing that he knows he can manage: his work ethic.
Marshall has stayed and worked with assistant defensive coach Drew Pearson  after every practice throughout the season to improve his technique, endurance and ability to finish plays. The two seem to work equally hard in their sessions, as Pearson plays the role of the wide receiver and challenges Marshall to be physical with him off the line and throughout the route.
“It’s the sign of a guy who wants to be great. He’s not satisfied with where he’s at yet. He wants to be great, and he works at his craft,” said interim head coach Clay Helton. “There is a fine line between overworking yourself, but there have been a lot of guys who have spent a lot of hours on this practice field that have gone on to do great things. I think that Biggie wants to fall in line with those guys.”
The 6-foot-2, 200-pound freshman had already been known for his physical play at Long Beach Poly where he made the 2014 USA Today All-USA first team, and was widely considered the top high school cornerback in the entire country.
The amount of work Marshall has put in since arriving at USC has certainty impressed veteran players like redshirt junior Zach Banner, who has acted as a mentors for the younger guys.
“He’s a really hard worker and humble kid who is always out here doing extra after practice,” Banner said Wednesday. “He’s a really good player who is going to be really special.”
Marshall said that being around veteran defensive backs like Kevon Seymour, Adoree’ Jackson, linebacker Su’a Cravens and safety Chris Hawkins  has given him a unique opportunity to learn and develop as a cornerback.
“The adjustment has been really cool. Just take all that knowledge and soak it in,” Marshall said. “A lot of the older dudes have been bringing me along and helping me out through this whole transition, and I really appreciate that.”
Marshall has been thrown into the fire since he started at USC, stepping into his current role for Kevon Seymour, who was injured at the time.
Additionally, injuries to wide receivers such as Darreus Rodgers and Steven Mitchell resulted in Jackson playing more snaps on offense; and Marshall as cornerback. Marshall leads all USC DBs with 280 snaps and has allowed only eight catches on 16 targets, with one interception.
“If you ask me one thing about Iman that has enabled him to play early, I would say it’s his competitiveness,” defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox said.  “He’s a guy who wants to go play man to man. He wants to go make the big tackle on third and three.”
Cameron Smith, who also became a defensive starter as a freshman, is excited about playing alongside Marshall in the coming years at USC.
“Marshall is a baller, obviously, because we have seen what he has done,” Smith said. “I think that is one of the tougher positions, to come in and play at corner, because of the athleticism and football IQ you need back there. He’s doing a great job, and he’s going to keep getting better. He’s going to be huge in the coming years.”
Marshall had another impressive practice Wednesday when he intercepted Cody Kessler’s pass to receiver George Katrib and had a few pass breakups after. But despite his hard work, Marshall believes that it will never be enough to prepare him for the games. But, Marshall says that he stays with coaches after every practice to keep improving his fundamentals and his physicality so that he’ll be in the best position possible to make the next play.
“You know at the position I’m playing, you can’t be perfect and that you’re never going to have a perfect outing,” Marshall said. “There are players who have been in the NFL for 10 years who have become so technically sound at the position, who still mess up a little bit. And then things can happen wrong. So, that’s why coach and I do as much as possible to be prepared.”
Justin Wilcox said that he’s told Marshall that he can be “disappointed, just not discouraged,” by those “up for grabs” passes that he’s come short on this season in games such as Stanford and Notre Dame this season. But Wilcox added that the Division I atmosphere hasn’t been too big for Marshall by any means, and says that the ferocious way “Biggie” approaches every practice is going to translate into an incredibly bright future for the freshman.
“If it is a 50-50 ball and they make a great catch, ‘hey man’, I’m still going to put him out there again because I believe in him,” Wilcox said. “Just like I do the other guys, I believe he’s going to make those plays when it’s his day. He has got a lot of room to grow still. But, I’m glad he is with us, and we are going to keep continuing to push him.”

When I was first offered the position to be incoming multimedia director this summer, it felt like a USC dream was finally coming true.
Over the past three years, I would watch my friends run off to the Daily Trojan newsroom after class to work on their respective articles and catch up with friends.
It got to the point where if you wanted to know what assignment a friend was working on, you’d ask him or her, “Is this for class or the DT?”
Nine times out of 10, the answer was DT. 
That’s how dedicated my friends were to the paper as was everyone else in the organization.
I never told any of my friends this, but ever since my sophomore year at SC I wondered what it would be like to be a part of such a highly esteemed, hardworking group of student journalists.
As a broadcast and digital journalism major, I repeated to myself, “Kay, there is no place at a print publication for a broadcast major. Stay in your lane!”
Television was my lane.
After all, how could I shoot packages for class, intern off-campus, cover various red carpet events, maintain good grades and write for the DT? 
Even thinking about it now makes me panic.
As a senior, I’ve learned college is about making “this or that” decisions and committing to them. Sure, you don’t have to be 100 percent certain it’s what you want to do for the rest of your life, but some decision is better than none at all.
The way I see it college is like a hurried waiter that keeps asking if you want the soup or salad.
So, when the opportunity presented itself to join the DT for the first time as a multimedia director at the start of my last year in college, I couldn’t say no.
In class, they teach us multimedia is king. I understand why it is imperative that our paper has a grasp on this changing digital media landscape. Not to mention, multimedia is kinda my thing. 
For me, the new position meant more than  checking off an item on my USC bucket list. It was a chance for me use what I’d learned about tools like soundslides and story maps to help strengthen the DT’s online presence and implement it creatively — all while doing what I love to do. 
Multimedia is my beat, my column.
***
In these past nine weeks, I‘ve learned a lot about myself and what it takes to lead a team. 
It’s tricky trying to find a system that works well with everyone’s schedule, to have people in the newsroom and to create consistent content.
Despite these kinks in the new system, I know that I have a strong handful of editors who I can rely on to get things done. I am insanely impressed with my team of editors and the original content they’ve eagerly put together.
Here a few multimedia highlights from the semester so far:
USC Cribs: Ever wondered what a day in a dorm of a USC student’s like? In this new web series, we let viewers take a step inside some of the stylish, unique cribs on campus. Executive produced by Fernando Hurtado.

DT 4-1-1: This semester, we launched the DT’s first weekly newsletter curated and written by deputy multimedia editor and broadcast junior Eli Goodstein. 
.@USC_USG wants #fallbreak, @uscwomensvolley wins (again) & Colbert returns to TV. Here’s what you missed this week: http://t.co/rAz1QFhoMt

If you <3 theSkimm or live under a rock, “Eli’s DT 4-1-1,” is the new best friend you need!
College Football Pick’em: Move over ESPN! Patrick Vossler — a junior economics and finance major — uses algorithms and stats to create a table that breaks down college football predictions every week.

This one’s for you, fantasy football-ers!
BONUS Highlight: Our very first Periscope was of the University Village, and it was a success.
Very cool! Watching the @USC University Village construction update LIVE on the @dailytrojan#Periscope?pic.twitter.com/BjnlSBLo34
— Kay Angrum (@kayangrum) September 30, 2015
Though I am proud that I was able to spearhead lot of these firsts for the Daily Trojan, I know that there is still a lot of work left to be done to take our multimedia to the next level. In order to be successful editor or director you have to be self-motivated and creative with a drive to get better each and every day.
So, next time you’re wondering whether you should order a soup or salad, just remember: It doesn’t hurt to try both.
Kay Angrum is a senior majoring in broadcast and digital journalism. She is also multimedia editor of the Daily Trojan.

The ways students approach assignments reveals a lot about their study habits. As college students, we follow patterns of how we attempt to learn, whether it is a simple 10-point quiz or a 10-page essay. Learning new concepts can either invoke passion for the subject or apathy for the assignment. College is a time when students can not only learn in their classes, but also learn about themselves. This includes discovering how you learn best and developing a positive work ethic. After attending USC for the past two months, I have noticed many different students whose study habits constantly change. Not one student is perfect at studying, and we can all fit within these categories.
1. Early Bird Gets the Worm
All students are envious of this person when a test or paper due date rolls around because this person always begins their work when it is assigned. Remember this student when you have not started an assignment because they have definitely already completed it. This admirable student is the most efficient with their time. However, he or she is often the most anxious if they ever procrastinate. This type of student, who always remembers the due dates and never forgets an assignment, is good to study with.
2. I’ll Just Do It Tomorrow
These people are found in every university classroom. They always have small amounts of work that just piles up over time. Although not the most developed procrastinators, these students are always put things off until later. They have neglected to start a large assignment until the day before it was due at some point, and therefore, they are constantly trying to ensure it does not happen again. They will often have a long list of uncompleted tasks that was written several weeks or months ago.
3. Playing the Waiting Game
This is the type of person all students are truly afraid of becoming. In fact, most students compare themselves to these procrastinators in order to ensure they are not the “worst” student. These  students typically write their essays the morning they’re due, whether it is at 2 a.m. or right before their 11 a.m. class. They may be extremely intelligent, but they have perfected procrastination to an art form. Be careful in trying to imitate this student’s habits because they play a dangerous game.
4. Will Not Stop Whining
This type of person will do nearly everything before they start their work, especially complaining. There’s at least one of these students in every class, and he or she is often the one who attempts to challenge the professor, of course in a whiny voice.  When they work in study groups, the whining only gets worse.
5. The Ace of Spades
This type of student does not have to study in order to receive the best grade in the class. They are the student we are all slightly envious of, because they are very successful, regardless of effort. However, there is no need to fret, they too will endure serious challenges when confronted with material they truly do not understand because usually this student’s specialty is in one area and not all their classes come as easily.

Well we have officially reached the halfway mark of the semester. I can’t say I’m surprised at all.  As cheesy as it is, there’s a reason the saying “time flies when you’re having fun” exists. When people ask me how I’ve been enjoying my time here in London, I’ll usually give them an answer along the lines of “it’s great, amazing, I love it, etc.” but I’ve realized that response is totally boring and gives people no real indication of how I’m actually doing. Since this realization, I’ve spent some time reflecting on why I am able to talk about my experiences here so positively.
Simply put, I think when it comes down to it I just feel extremely lucky to be here. My roommate and I always joke that we’ve hit our “peak” in life; we get to live in one of the most diverse and beautiful cities in the world as students with no real responsibilities in complete control of how we want to spend our time. Aside from the three to six hours of class we have per day, we don’t really have any other commitments here. One day I can come home, go to yoga and do some grocery shopping, while other days we may sporadically decide to go to a fancy afternoon tea.
Our program plans a huge number of outings for us, from visits to Stonehenge and Bath to seeing Benedict Cumberbatch in “Hamlet” at the Barbican Theater. To top it all off, the proximity of other European countries allows us to travel over the weekends. In just these next two weeks I’m going to Barcelona with my mom, as well as visiting friends from high school in Milan. My life in London is a series of endless adventures and opportunities to explore new places.
Through all this craziness, I found that I was almost taking advantage of my time here. It’s so easy to get caught up in it that I got used to this kind of lifestyle and didn’t stop to think just how amazing it is that I am able to do all this. Studying abroad really is a privilege, one that not everyone can experience, and for that reason, I think myself and anyone else off on any international academic adventure should stop and remember to not take our time abroad for granted. I don’t know if there will ever be another point in my life where I will be financially stable enough to live in a city like London. And if I do, I highly doubt I will have the time, or luxury, to be able to partake in all the different types of activities that I have this past semester.
My time here really is precious, and that’s why when people ask me how I’m enjoying London I respond so enthusiastically. Because any point in your life where you value every minute as much as I do, it is something truly special. It’s something I will continuously have to remind myself not to take for granted.

For one week in October, China is in complete disarray as travelers take over every airport, train station and bus stop. This is all due to China’s seven-day national holiday called Golden Week. While some of my peers bravely decided to stay inside China during this chaotic week to travel through the country’s more mountainous and scenic cities, a handful of us secured our residence permits so that we could exit the country and travel to places like Korea, Thailand, Taiwan and Japan. I spent my week in Tokyo and Taipei.
Upon my arrival into Japan, I could immediately tell how different it was from China. While Shanghai is definitely one of the most modern cities in China, Tokyo seemed to blow it out of the water. There was fast, reliable Wi-Fi at every corner of the city, and no firewall-blocking access to certain sites, a great change in pace from VPN-necessary China. Efficiency is clearly taken very seriously, as many restaurants have a vending machine ordering system rather than actual servers who take your order. There were many, many trains — yes trains, not a subway system — that ran like clockwork and could always be counted on.
What I found most interesting was that even when trains were packed at rush hour, there seemed to be some order to the chaos. In Shanghai during rush hour, there’s a lot of pushing and shoving and line-cutting, but that didn’t seem to be the case in Tokyo. Although yes, at times, the trains were so packed that I thanked my tall genes for allowing me to breathe the air above, the trains were also very quiet and everyone remained calm.
But China does have one thing up on Tokyo: the cost of food. After being in Shanghai for a month, I got really used to spending very little on food, usually around $2 or $3, so the cost of meals in Tokyo, which was about the same as in the United States, seemed crazy to me. To be fair, though, I was eating some top-notch ramen and curry. If your sight-seeing in Tokyo doesn’t involve food, you’re doing Tokyo wrong. 
Like Japan, Taiwan is known for its food, and there’s no place better than a night market to try some 小吃 (xiao chi), or snacks. Having spent a majority of my summer in Taipei, I knew exactly which foods I was returning for: scallion pancakes and shaved ice. And what’s nice is that the cost of food in Taiwan is about the same as in China. But that’s about all the two countries have in common.
Some of the many differences between the two countries include that Taiwan uses traditional characters and China uses simplified characters. Taiwan is much cleaner than China (you can’t eat or drink on the subway), which is actually pretty surprising because you’ll rarely find a trashcan. Like Tokyo, Taipei also seems more modern and efficient.
However, my absolute favorite thing about Taiwan is how small it is. You can hike a mountain and go to the beach all in the same day. Taiwan is truly the hidden gem of Asia: it has the best food, the most beautiful landscape and the kindest people.

A few simple DIY crafts will make your apartment or house at school much more homey. Palak Patel | Daily Trojan
As college students we tend to be pressed for both time and money. All too often we end up faced with a living space that doesn’t really speak to us. Blank white walls and empty shelves might look zen, but the lack of decor can make your space feel less inviting and homey. It’s worth dedicating just a couple hours of your weekend to sprucing up your dorm room or apartment, and turning it into a space that you can really call your own. So round up your roommates, turn up the radio and break out the scissors and glue. It’s time to get crafty on a budget. 
The DIY Mirror
Grab a few spare pieces of colorful fabric and yarn, as well as a mirror that you’ve got lying around the house. Cover the edges of the mirror in swatches of fabric, and don’t be afraid to mix up the patterns. However, try to keep the color scheme similar so the design looks unified. Then use your glue gun to create patterns out of the thread, and you’ll be left with the perfect statement piece.
Door Tags
Find a picture of your hometown, or even a dream destination. Then use a photo editing app like BeFunky to add in your name, and a distinctly “you” saying or quote. If you want to mix it up, have your roommate make your door tag while you make theirs.
Indoor Garden
Succulents are some of the hardiest plants out there, and survive well even in the scorching L.A. heat. They come in a variety of colors, shapes and sizes to suit any style, and are incredibly inexpensive. Pick out a few and arrange them on your counter to add a little greenery into your space. And best of all? The succulents won’t die on you even if you forget to water them for a few weeks during finals season!
Tie-Dye Mural
Take a big piece of white cloth, and tie dye it with your three favorite colors. Afterwards, leave it as is or add some graphic designs over the top using a permanent marker. Use a few push pins to secure it above your bed and voilà, you’ve got your very own art piece to wake up to every morning!
Multi-Use Mason Jars
Take a few mason jars and clean them out. Then grab some craft paint and decorate them anyway you’d like (My personal favorite is painted white with gold polka dots). Afterwards, you can display them on your desk or tabletop and use them to store anything from spoons to makeup brushes. 
Decorating your space can be much more relaxing, and rewarding, than you might expect. It doesn’t take long, and you’ll be surprised at what a difference it makes in turning your dorm room or apartment into a cozy place that you love to call home.

By now, most college students probably have a handful of “internet regrets” a.k.a items on their social media profile that they wish they hadn’t posted or hadn’t been tagged in. Whether it is a sappy status back in middle school or a more recent incriminating photo, it’s likely there is something out there you wish you could go back and delete.  Below are some of the most common social media regrets you should be sure to avoid:  
Unflattering pictures
If you’ve gone through puberty, chances are you probably look quite different from your 13- or 14-year-old self. Most people try to hide their old pictures on Facebook, but there’s always that one friend who digs up an embarrassing photo and posts it on your wall for the whole world to see. #Sorrynotsorry
 Pointless status updates
Besides looking your most awkward, the middle school years were also probably when you posted the most random, boring and pointless statuses. If you scroll down far enough, you’ll probably find something along the lines of “_____ is craving frozen yogurt” or “Like my status for a truth is” and other cringe-worthy Facebook posts. 
 Lovey dovey posts about an ex or partner
 Equally entertaining as the pointless statuses are the sappy statuses. Back in the day, I remember so many of my classmates felt the need to broadcast to the world their love for a significant other. The worst posts, however, weren’t even the PDA ones — they were the overly emotional rants about exes. #Ihateyou #Boyssuck
Profanity or bad language
Now that many of us are looking for jobs, we also have to make sure we maintain a professional image on our social media. Many young adults are guilty of letting an occasional f-bomb or two slip, but they forget that the whole Facebook world — including past teachers, friends’ parents, and sometimes even recruiters — can see what they write.
Drunken selfies
Last but not least, the social media regret that is probably giving college students the biggest headache now is the drunken selfie. Usually it’s a tagged photo from a party, but sometimes it can be your own accidental Snapchat of a night out in L.A. Whether or not these kinds of photos are within your control, you better make sure to untag yourself or delete it the next day before it’s on everyone’s newsfeed.
As college students, we are guaranteed to have at least a few internet regrets every now and then. Luckily for us, Facebook and other social media networks provide privacy settings that allow users to hide incriminating photos and statuses from the public eye.

For a company whose mantra is all about being fast and efficient with pizza cooked in 180 seconds, the same speed obviously translated to Blaze Pizza’s slogan, “Fast Fire’d.” They moved so quickly that they didn’t even realize the extra apostrophe that snuck into the slogan. In fact, Fire’d is not a word in the English language and while the creators of the slogan may have been going for a unique and catchy phrase, for us grammar buffs out there, it’s hard to get past the apostrophe misuse. So while it may stand out to some people as an original and quirky statement, mirroring Blaze Pizza’s brand image, for others, it is difficult to see past the blatant spelling error, something we must be reminded of every time we bike past Gateway or any other Blaze location.
