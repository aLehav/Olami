A dynamic transformation in brand image and personal identity led to the musical growth of one of the most prominent LGBTQ+ rappers of our generation: Lil Nas X. Preceded by a meme-ified social media campaign to launch the era, his self-titled debut album “MONTERO” presents his duality of playfulness and vulnerability as he details his journey through his triumphs and insecurities.
In a digital era where separating the artist from the art is virtually impossible, Lil Nas X flawlessly intertwines his active social media persona and his work without letting it cloud his craft. His social profiles act as a supplement for his work, creating connections beyond the music and making the music seem more personalized to fans.
Despite the comedic stan, Twitter-like personality, the “Old Town Road” rapper’s musical growth has allowed for meaningful self-reflection throughout his debut album. “SUN GOES DOWN” remains a standalone track that details the realizations of his homosexuality, intrusive suicidal thoughts and struggles as a gay Black man feeling self-conscious about his identity. The mellow instrumental paired with his soft voice brings an optimistic end to the track, singing the lyrics about his coming out: “I’m happy that it all worked out for me / I’ma make my fans so proud of me.”
The rapper’s roots and pre-fame life are topics he doesn’t shy from either as he slows the pace of the album. “TALES OF  DOMINICA” and “VOID” document his low points in life and insecurities surrounding his future. Writing a note to his former self by referring to his “old friend from the road,” he shares his fears during his years prior to mainstream success until eventually building the courage to pursue a musical career. 
The dark-themed tracks express the common anxieties of someone undergoing the societal pressures of success and internalized identity conflict, yet knowing the artist’s personal growth adds a hopeful touch to the ballads. 
Vulnerability isn’t the only development in Nas’ musical career; his music is no longer confined to rap. Appropriate for the angsty era we live in, Nas dabbles in the rock genre with his breakup song “LIFE AFTER SALEM,” detailing a dying relationship where he channels his frustrations at someone who no longer reciprocates his love. Beginning with a slow electric guitar riff and picking up mid-song, the song takes the listener through Nas’ rageful emotions.
Continuing the emotional journey and genre exploration, his second collaboration with the Cyrus family, “AM I DREAMING” featuring Miley Cyrus, is a soothing yet passionate ballad that provides an impactful finale to the album. The duo harmonize, begging a lover to never forget them following their separation. The perfect pair for the song join forces to conclude Nas’ star-studded album.
The collaborations speak to the grandeur of Nas’ long-anticipated debut album. With appearances from Doja Cat, Megan Thee Stallion and Elton John, Lil Nas X establishes his own unique sound, enough to not get upstaged by his own collaborators. As high points, Doja Cat and the H-Town Hottie complement Lil Nas sonically through their distinct rapping styles in “SCOOP” and “DOLLA SIGN SLIME,” respectively. The feel-good anthems exude the playful cheeriness that follows the female rappers through their lyricism and delivery — perfectly matched with Nas’ musical style and Twitter personality that we’re familiar with.
The bubbly brand he’s created for himself shines through in the debut album with his well-decided singles including “MONTERO (Call Me By Your Name),” “INDUSTRY BABY” and “THATS WHAT I WANT.” All three boisterous tracks screaming triumph in their own distinctive ways, Nas asserts his material successes, sexual desires and acceptance of his identity. 
An evolution from “Old Town Road” and “Panini,” Nas’ career now carries a purpose beyond solely entertaining; he’s become a mainstream voice for LGBTQ+youth in “MONTERO.” Few artists showcase the hardships of the LGBTQ+ community, but the Georgia rapper’s diverse tracklist maintains a balance between the personal and the gleeful aspects that come with being part of the community. 
Songs of victory and vulnerability present the artistic progression of Lil Nas X, who proved not only his ability to entertain but also his versatility in musical genre and lyrical content. From a Nicki Minaj stan to a hit-maker, the rapper has created a body of work whose potential impact lands far beyond his provocative yet comedic digital personality. In Nas’ own words, “[he] put [his] entire bussy into that album.”

The USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative published in September 2021 a news report concluding that popular Hollywood movies continue to underrepresent Latinx communities.
USC graduates Ariana Case, Zoily Mercado and Karla Hernandez reported this by analyzing Latinx actors, speaking characters, directors, producers and casting directors in 1,300 films from 2007 to 2019.
The study found that movies continue to lack Latinx actors even though they comprise 20% of the U.S. population. Only 5% of the 51,158 on-screen characters are Latinx, while 3.5% of films cast them in leading roles. Girls and women performed a majority of these leading and co-leading roles, but comprise a mere 1.9% of all 1,300 movies. 
This lack of representation was much worse in the 45 and older category, where Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz were the only actresses seen. 
Latinx actresses were often seen as background characters when they were featured, making up only 2.2% of leading and co-leading roles. Only six of these leading actresses were Afro-Latinx. 
Hollywood’s disregard of these communities is severe given that 79% of U.S. states have a higher percentage of Latinx residents compared to the representation of Latinx people in films produced by Hollywood. 
The Latinx community makes up 39% of California’s population and 49% of Los Angeles’ population, but movies swiftly disregard these statistics along with the rate of consumer spending. While 25% of movie tickets are bought by Latinx people, meaning they make up $1.7 trillion in profit, 35 films had no Latinx characters.
These movies especially failed to represent Latinx characters through an intersectional lens. Ninety five films failed to feature any Latinx characters with disabilities, and 98 films had no LGBTQ+ Latinx characters. 
The behind-the-scenes demographics align with the stark on-screen disservice. Across 1,300 films, only 4.2% of directors were Latinx. This resulted in a 50 to one ratio of white male to Latinx directors. The statistics were bleaker for women, with only three directors of Hispanic or Latina origin out of 1,447.   
Much of the representation that occurs on screen is accompanied by common stereotypes. Out of 94 Latinx characters, 8.5% were immigrants; 37.2% spoke no English and 30.5% had a foreign accent. The 30.5% was deduced from 59 characters who spoke English in the film, implying that the rest did not speak English. 
Films also carried a prevalent portrayal of Latinx people as criminals, perpetrators of organized crime and violent crime, tying them to illegal behavior and its consequences. As a result, most characters would often be affiliated with gangs, cartels or other syndicates. 
The report suggested solutions to this lack of diversity that could potentially shift the plates of inclusion. Talent agencies could create consideration lists adjusted to the proportion of the Latinx community within the general populace, eventually recruiting and signing more actors. 
Studios and production companies and casting directors could broaden casting to encourage Latinx talent to audition, even recruiting new Hispanic or Latinx directors for top jobs. Film festivals and nonprofits could launch initiatives to nurture Latinx filmmakers and philanthropists to fund these communities. 
Corporations could hire more Latinx workers to work behind the scenes of ad campaigns. In addition to this, legislators could create tax incentives for productions starring and including Hispanic and Latinx talent while funding their arts education. 
The report presented the unequivocally ignored Latinx talent who deserve recognition and gratitude for their contribution to Hollywood films. The findings also display Hollywood’s lack of progress in terms of serving the Latinx community who so frequently patronize Hollywood’s films.

Karan Menon remembers his first live television experience — winning the National Geographic Bee when he was in the eighth grade. In high school, he joined Quiz Bowl, a trivia-based competition activity encompassing different academic subjects. 
“I’ve always been into trivia and different competitions,” said Menon, a junior majoring in computer science. “I’ve been a very curious individual. I love reading about different things. I just go to Wikipedia and get lost there for hours, and I’ve been doing competitions since a young age.” 
When he got to college, Menon knew Quiz Bowl was something he wanted to continue participating in and decided to revive the team at USC, which had been inactive for years. The team, which consists of Menon, Brendan Glascock and Ann Nguyen, competed in the NBC College Bowl, advancing to the final championship episode against Columbia University, which aired Sept. 7. 
The show consisted of four rounds of face-offs in a bracket-style tournament, each taking place in a different episode with questions covering topics from steel drums to Drake. Although they ultimately lost to Columbia in the final round, the USC team beat rival UCLA in the qualifying and quarterfinal rounds and the University of Alabama in the semifinals. For coming in second place, each student received a $25,000 scholarship. 
Glascock, a junior majoring in computer science, did not have any Quiz Bowl experience prior to joining the USC team. He participated in Academic Decathlon in high school and figured that Quiz Bowl would be similar but with an expanded curriculum. When the Quiz Bowl team reached out with the College Bowl possibility, it was a no-brainer for Glascock. 
“I’m a diehard game show fan. I’ve watched game shows all my life,” he said. “I jumped on the opportunity.”
After filling out applications, attending Zoom interviews and sending in various photos and videos to NBC producers for the College Bowl show, Menon, Glascock and Nguyen, a senior majoring in film and television production, received notifications of their selection and in the spring were flown out to Los Angeles, all expenses paid. Upon their arrival, the team was quarantined for two weeks before the filming began. 
“I think the suspense of being in that hotel room and not [being] allowed to leave your room for two weeks really added to the excitement,” Glascock said. “We had nothing else to do but just think about what was about to happen.”
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, producers filmed the show without a live audience. For Glascock, who had no prior live television experience, this eased his nerves. 
“It was a calming set,” he said. “There are lots of natural colors … the whole thing is made of wood and it kind of feels like a classroom. They have all these books and globes and things everywhere, so I think the jitters calmed down very quickly.”
Football star Peyton Manning, along with his brother and television host, Cooper Manning, hosted the show. Menon said he was able to form personal connections with each of them. 
“Even though [Manning] is this huge football star, he’s a really nice guy,” Menon said. “Between each of our questions and before and after them, he would come up to us, chat with us, and he would know each of us by a first name basis.”
Aarya Patel, Menon’s childhood friend, recalls seeing Menon thrive in competition all the way back in middle school when he contributed to starting the National Geographic Bee at his school. 
“I sort of knew that they could [make it to the finals] because I know Karan and I know how much he knows … especially considering his past.” Patel said. “It was really cool to see someone I knew on national television, especially with Peyton Manning.”
Menon and Glascock both said they did not expect to make it to the final round of the competition and were pleasantly surprised at how well the team performed. 
“I went into the competition with no expectations. I was like, ‘I’ll just go here, have fun, try my best,’” Menon said. “So, when we made the championship competition, I was really excited and really proud of our team.”
On the night NBC aired the final round, Rock and Reilly’s, a bar in the USC Village, had a watch party to celebrate the College Bowl team’s accomplishments. 
“It was like watching the Super Bowl,” Glascock said. “All the TVs in the bar were tuned to the one station, NBC, and people were cheering raucously for every single question, even the ones that I thought were trivial or easy.”
Since the show aired, the members of the team have received somewhat of a celebrity treatment on campus, said Glascock.
“Quite a few people have recognized me on campus,” he said. “Sometimes I’ll just be skating down Trousdale or whatever and somebody says, ‘Aren’t you the guy from that TV show?’”
Menon said he understands the strength of the Trojan spirit in a new way since being on the show.
“[This experience] really taught me the value of this USC community,” Menon said. “I became even more proud of the school and what it has to offer for us as individuals.”

USC men’s water polo swept competition at the Aggie Roundup, winning all three games by six goals or more, improving their record to a convincing 7-0. The Trojans faced three top-15 ranked opponents this past weekend, beating No. 11 San José State, No. 14 Santa Clara and No. 8 UC Davis.
The Trojans started the weekend with a 12-5 win against San José State, a game where senior 2-meter Jake Ehrhardt and redshirt junior driver Hannes Daube both scored their 100th career goals for the Trojans. 
USC fell to a one-goal deficit early but proceeded to fire off three straight goals in a three-and-a-half-minute span to take the lead at the end of the first. After, the Trojans never looked back, as they stopped the Spartans from scoring consecutive goals throughout the match. 
Junior driver Marcus Longton also continued his hot start, notching his fifth multi-goal game of the season as he scored two against the Spartans.
In the second game of the weekend, USC took on Santa Clara and beat the Broncos18-6. The Trojans had a multi-goal lead for almost the entire game, with the closest score being 3-2 before USC scored 3 straight to end the second. 
Redshirt senior driver Jacob Mercep officially moved into sixth place on the all-time goals list. Mercep surpassed former Trojan Daniel Leyson, currently the coach of UC Davis who USC played against for their final game of the day.
For goal differential, the Aggies kept pace with the Trojans better than any other team this season, but USC won with a score of 13-7. The game was close, with a tied score of 4-4 after three minutes into the third period.
About 11 seconds after the Aggies scored their fourth goal, the Trojans netted eight straight goals to firmly stay in control and win their seventh straight game of the season. 
Head coach Marko Pintaric was pleased about the Trojans performance but said he felt his team desired more.
“We didn’t put the easy opportunities away, and this was a trend that followed the team this weekend,” Pintaric said. “This is something that I’m taking away from this weekend that we’re going to try to tune up for [the] incoming week.”
Mercep would tie hiscareer-best, scoring seven goals in the game and helping power the Trojans to victory. Senior goalie Nic Porter continued to keep the defense locked down as he would contribute 12 saves in the contest, effectively moving himself to eighth all-time on the career saves list.
USC continued to show its depth this weekend as 18 different Trojans got on the score sheet at the Aggie Roundup. 
“This is a team sport and that’s what we promoted here … As coaches we feel confident that we can play everyone,” Pintaric said. 
This is USC’s best start to a season since their 2018 campaign when it started the year with 17 straight wins. 
Next week the Trojans are off to the Mountain Pacific Invitational tournament, where they play some of the best schools in the nation. 
USC, being the joint top ranked team in the nation, has a first-round bye. Throughout the weekend, it will play three games, but its opponents and times for the matches are yet to be announced because of the tournament style.

The USC women’s volleyball team fell in five sets against the University of San Diego Friday in their final preseason matchup before Pac-12 conference play. The Trojans battled to atie-breaking fifth set but were unable to close out the match, ending the score 3-2 in favor of the Toreros (25-22, 20-25, 13-25, 25-19, 15-13). 
USC now enters Pac-12 play with a record of 4-5.
The Trojans led for the majority of the first set. However, forced and unforced errors enabled the Toreros to take the lead and eventually the set. USC then regrouped and refocused on the match by strengthening their defensive and offensive presence. With a hitting percentage of .250 for the second set and .424 for the third set, San Diego was unable to respond, and both sets went to the Trojans.
In the fourth set, USC wavered a few moments, which the Toreros capitalized. With trouble on the Trojans offensive end, San Diego took the set, and the match headed to a tie-breaker. 
Then the race to the final point began as both teams left it all out on the court. With the momentum on their side, San Diego built a lead on USC; but, with big swings from graduate student middle blocker Candice Denny and junior opposite hitter Emilia Weske, the Trojans stayed in the match. Yet, despite their efforts, the Toreros were able to pull away in the final points, ending the set with the score of 15-13.        
“The fifth set is always going to be a ‘crapshoot,’” said head coach Brad Keller in a postgame press conference. “It’s not a real game; it’s a race at that point … we dug a four-point hole … you’re really in a tight situation.”
Despite the outcome of the match, Denny said she hopes the Trojans will face the Toreros again in the future.        
“At the end, [San Diego] just barely edged by, but I’m happy with how close we were. I know the next time we see them on the court, it’s probably not going to be so close, and it will be in our favor,” Denny said. “Tonight I can honestly say we finally clicked into place as a team. So, I think, from this point forward, we’re going to start putting the pressure on people; We’re not easing up.”
After USC’s loss to San Diego, nothing else lies in-between the Trojans and the Pac-12 conference. However, with heavy-hitter programs like No. 16 Stanford and No. 13 Oregon on their schedule, Keller plans to take things one step at a time.
“We’ll just take it day by day,” Keller said. “We’ll break down film, look at certain things, come up with drills and have conversations and build it brick by brick. That’s just what we have to do.”
The Trojans now have crosstown rival UCLA next up on the schedule in Pauley Pavilion Sept. 22. Keller emphasized that improvement still needs to happen before they are on the court again.
“It’s always going to be about small, little things. Every single player on this team has their own laundry list of stuff they have to work on that will help put them in better spots on the court,” he said. “Now do I expect everyone to be perfect at it after a week or so? No, it’s a process, that’s why we’re working on it. But I think that from Hawaii to now, we improved in a lot of those areas, so I expect us to continue to improve on those things.”  
The Trojans start their Pac-12 opener against UCLA Wednesday at 7 p.m.

Living on the streets can be a dangerous and dehumanizing experience. People are not unhoused because they want to be but rather because they don’t have a choice. And yet, the predominant approach to solving the ever-growing national crisis of homelessness is to criminalize it. 
Los Angeles’ new anti-camping ordinance went into effect on Sept. 3, altering the city’s current anti-camping law to prohibit “sitting, sleeping, lying, storing personal property, or otherwise obstructing the public right-of-way.” This law makes it illegal for the unhoused population to exist in most parts of the city and essentially persecutes people who are simply trying to survive. 
The issue of homelessness in the United States is a pervasive and complicated topic that has taken on multiple forms throughout history. From the refugees displaced during warfare to thousands of families tossed to the streets during the Great Depression to the low-income populations removed by urban renewal in the mid-19th century, homelessness is a chronic and systemic problem that cannot be solved by pushing people to a city’s corners. 
Backers of the ordinance argue that it would help the city regain public spaces while helping the unhoused population. However, the ordinance only states where people cannot be — it doesn’t state anything about where unhoused people can go. 
While there are shelters set in place, the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority only has shelter beds for about 39% of the homeless population. People facing homelessness have to decide between the risk of staying on the streets and getting arrested or leaving their self-made refuge, carrying everything they own to a shelter and abandoning their only safety net — often to just be turned away due to a limited supply of beds. If it’s an overnight-only shelter, those lucky enough to obtain a space have to repeat this strenuous process and try their luck again the next night for a basic human necessity.  
On a constitutional level, the Supreme Court has consistently ruled, from Bell v. City of Boise (2015) to Martin v. City of Boise (2018), that criminalizing homelessness is unconstitutional and that people experiencing homelessness cannot be criminally punished for not having other alternatives than to live and sleep outside on public property. 
Anti-vagrancy laws have been used as a solution to homelessness in the past, and they have all failed. More than half the $100 million city budget set on alleviating homelessness goes to the police department to enforce these futile and inefficacious laws, yet L.A. continues to have the second-largest homeless population in the nation. These failed tactics should push us to explore different solutions, but this ordinance proves otherwise. 
Multiple factors have led to L.A.’s current homelessness crisis, including tough-on-crime laws, racist zoning, state cuts to mental health services and wage disparities, all of which impact Black and Latinx communities the most. Furthermore, the unhoused population are often the victims of transinstitutionalization, which means they are moved from the streets to the mental health system to the criminal system and then right back to the streets where they further struggle to survive. This is not an issue we can ignore any longer. The ordinance displaces unhoused people into regions of the city where they cannot be seen, hiding the issue rather than solving it. 
People who are unhoused have a much higher rate of police interaction and are much more likely to become victims of police violence. About the one in three times that a Los Angeles Police Department officer uses force, it is against someone who is experiencing homelessness. There is an evident connection between unsheltered homelessness, police violence and systemic racism, making the need to dismantle anti-homelessness laws ever more pressing. 
One clear example of this was in the case of Wayne Jones, a Black man experiencing homelessness, diagnosed with schizophrenia and living in West Virginia. An officer found Jones jaywalking and asked him for identification, which Jones did not possess, and if he had a weapon.  Jones admitted that he had a small fixed-blade knife on him. Four other officers arrived on scene, tased him multiple times and despite Jones being secured and incapacitated, opened fire, shooting him 22 times. These ordinances further empower the police to harass and punish citizens for minor misconduct,  to harm the innocent and do absolutely nothing to help solve homelessness.
An alternative to passing these ordinances can be seen in the Measure H sales tax. Passed in 2017, it is one example of a successful strategy in helping people leave the streets. Since then, the number of people housed through the homeless services system has doubled. Additionally, there were larger outreach and funding programs for permanent housing units and assistance for clearing criminal records of those unhoused. The project was projected at $355 million a year, but in order to provide an optimal homeless services system, an additional $500 million would be needed. 
The criminalization of homelessness is not the solution, and if anything, it worsens the crisis. Adding a criminal record to someone who is unhoused only further hurts their chances for access to employment, housing and education and disrupts entire communities. The passing of these ordinances and similar methods must stay in the past. They’ve failed more than once and our communities cannot carry on like this any longer.

It’s 2021 — we’ve all taken the Myers-Briggs personality test. Those mysterious little initials can be found in many peoples’ Twitter bios, right next to the peace sign emoji and their graduation year.
The Myers-Briggs test is a questionnaire that allegedly defines the taker’s personality type, strengths and weaknesses. It’s the psychological equivalent of zodiac signs, in all effect.
The first letters of all 16 personality types are either I or E, representing introversion or extroversion, respectively. These terms are surely familiar enough, but one is so often mischaracterized, that its group has been essentially left out — from leadership opportunities, educational development, rebuilding efforts, the whole enchilada.
This all stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of what being an introvert exactly means.
If we were to leave our scientific understanding of introversion and extroversion to the wild wolves of the internet, Carl Jung would roll over in his grave and die again. Introversion is not the tendency to hate people or the complete lack of social skills — it’s simply a higher level of baseline arousal, meaning it takes less for them to feel stimulated. Where an extrovert may need a high-intensity sport, the introvert may need only a stroll around the block.
So extroverts are less “get high on the spice of life for the sake of adventure,” and more “if we don’t keep it moving, we will die of boredom right here on this couch.”
Introverts make up an estimated 50% of the human population, but you wouldn’t know that by just looking at our social expectations alone. Open-concept design plans have replaced cubicles with privacy walls; desks in elementary classrooms get clustered together to encourage collaboration and group work.
Group work  or “collaborative learning” makes it easy for less motivated students to ride the coattails of their harder-working colleagues, all while ignoring the basic strengths and preferences of — likely — half the class.
Michael Godsey, a high school English teacher, visited a public high school in California in 2015. He wrote of the experience: “All but four of the 26 teachers I witnessed had their students arranged in groups or with partners. Such formations aren’t necessarily irreconcilable with the needs of introverts, but these arrangements can inherently enable noisy, distracting conditions that make learning particularly difficult for certain students.”
An overemphasis on class participation plays a role, too, in isolating quiet students from their outspoken peers. Introverts take more time to develop their ideas and organize their thoughts, but when class discussion is worth up to 35% of the overall grade, there’s no time for careful consideration — now the focus is on impressing the professor with an improvised public speech.
Collaborative learning and forced debates can be pains in the ass for anybody who respects their education, but they can also create a blackhole through which all individual creativity is sucked into and destroyed.
Susan Cain, author of the acclaimed book “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking,” supports this: “When you’re working in a group, it’s hard to know what you truly think. We’re such social animals that we instinctively mimic others’ opinions … And, when we do disagree consciously, we pay a psychic price … people who dissent from group wisdom show heightened activation in the amygdala, a small organ in the brain associated with the sting of social rejection.”
If roughly half of the student body isn’t benefiting from the extroversion bias, and if neuroscience has proven its baleful side-effects, why are we participating in it?
There is a direct pipeline between how introverted students are treated in the classroom and their career mobility in the workforce. According to a University of Toronto Scarborough study, extroverts, specifically extroverted men, are far more likely to advance in their careers, not because they’re geniuses, but because “they’re adept at persuading people in situations like job interviews and negotiations.” 
Interestingly, further research renders this practice counterproductive. Hiring the most outspoken person in the room hardly, if ever, results in an efficient work environment. Introverted people make for more favorable leaders. Since they don’t feel that intense need for external validation or the heat of the spotlight, introverted managers, for example, are more likely to share in their team’s successes as well as their downfalls.
Since introverts process information more slowly, their conversations are focused and their responses measured. They’re more likely to lead with compassion, often getting to know their colleagues more deeply than, say, the schmoozy business major always roleplaying as the Devil’s advocate.
Anytime we find ourselves in a situation where half of the population is subject to ignorance or — worse yet — ridicule, thunderous revolution soon follows. Though in this case, admittedly, the revolution may be more quiet.
There is great value in solitude and independence. The abolishment of all things collaborative will never come, so there’s no need to swing the pendulum so hard in the other direction. Ultimately, we can never forget that we are social creatures with a deeply complex and turbulent internal life — a life we frequently abandon, maybe for fear of what lies in wait there.
