Sports fans are used to seeing the final countdowns of nail-biting contests during basketball or football games, but amid the coronavirus pandemic, the question remains: How many fans think of video games in the same fashion?
The sports universe has been put on pause due to the coronavirus, leaving little for people to do. Some might binge-watch reruns of “The Office” or “Friends” while others may be tuning in to old Kobe Bryant games or the new 10-part ESPN documentary on the 1997-98 Chicago Bulls that aired its first two episodes Sunday night.
Others might tune into live video game streams for sources of entertainment.
The reality is that esports has taken the world by storm, prompting audiences worldwide to flock to live streams of intense video game competitions of all genres. For example, Epic Games’ first “Fortnite” World Cup was won by 16-year-old Kyle Giersdorf (better known as Bugha in the gaming world) who took home a $3 million grand prize in 2019. And with “League of Legends,” “Counter-Strike” and “Overwatch” becoming increasingly popular among esports streamers, the industry has been estimated to have reached over 454 million viewers and to have grown into a billion-dollar industry. It’s all growing so fast that the International Olympic Committee has even discussed making esports an Olympic sport on more than one occasion.
What caught the attention of two million “Fortnite” World Cup viewers across the globe is still accessible via Twitch, Amazon’s live streaming platform. Esports competitors can stream from the safety of their own homes while their viewers watch from the same settings across the country. Instead of filling a stadium, people can now fill their bowls of popcorn to catch these online competitions.
Twitch garnered over three billion hours watched over the first quarter of 2020, an all-time high since its launch in 2011. Media giant Verizon reported that since the coronavirus outbreak and subsequent quarantines there has been a 75% increase in video game usage. It’s clear that while the sports world takes a pause, the esports world has almost experienced a rebirth for teens and adults around the globe.
Not only does esports give people something to do, but it brings people together to form a community. If you navigate the Twitch website, viewers are able to chat with each other as well as with the gamer they are watching; they can ask questions, start debates and find commonalities. A platform and industry that were once viewed merely as fillers of free time are now at the center of attention.
What’s more is that one of the most attractive features of viewing online gaming is its nonexistent price tag. One can spend money on donations to streamers or on Twitch Prime — an extension of Amazon’s Prime service, which includes monthly offers of video games, add-on content and the ability to purchase a free subscription to a user’s channel once per month — but for the vast majority, it is completely free to be entertained by gaming.
That’s right: There is no Uber charge to the stadium, no hundred-dollar ticket fee and no overpriced hot dogs. Rather, a chair, a computer and delicious home cooking are all you need to enjoy esports while in quarantine.

Netflix’s new family mockumentary “#blackAF” follows a fictionalized version of “Black-ish” creator Kenya Barris and his family’s experience as they navigate their Black identity in a society that is often against them. The show, released Friday, is framed as a documentary, made as part of Barris’ daughter Drea’s (Iman Benson) application to New York University’s film school. Barris plays himself and is joined by Rashida Jones as his wife Joya. Each episode tackles a different racial issue, but often misses the mark.
“#blackAF” will inevitably be compared to Barris’ ABC sitcom “Black-ish” for good reason. Both series are centered around a version of his own family and incorporate a narcissistic and hardworking father, a mother vocal about her advanced degree, a popular oldest daughter, a soft and nerdy younger son and a mischievous pair of middle-children. 
The challenge of portraying marginalized families on television lies in the difficulty of balancing the universal with the specific — it is impossible to fit every Black experience. “#blackAF” acknowledges this challenge: Barris’ character struggles to find a universal portrayal of the Black experience. Yet it’s hard to justify why the show’s title presents itself as such. 
Barris’ experience as a multi-millionaire Hollywood writer is far from universal. There is no comment on how wealth insulates Barris and his family from the hardships of the average Black family. In a time when celebratory portrayals of exorbitant wealth have fallen out of fashion, it doesn’t make sense that the privilege of wealth is rarely acknowledged beyond “first world problems.” 
It would have been more interesting to see the unique problems Barris faces as one of the biggest Black names in a predominantly white Hollywood, but instead “#blackAF” spends much of its time failing to convince the audience that Barris is still just like them — and not at all insulated. “It would have been interesting if …” is a good summation of how the show chooses to handle many of its issues.
Throughout the series, Barris does attempt to address critique, in one episode poking fun about how “Black-ish” was groundbreaking for “55-year-old white women”, but he makes little attempt to actually remedy more substantial issues raised by Black critics. 
One specific critique lies in Barris’ casting of mostly lighter-skinned Black people. In response to these accusations of colorism, Barris wrote in a since-deleted tweet, “I’m also not gonna make up a fake family that genetically makes no sense just for the sake of trying to fill quotas.” Another critique of Barris’ shows is that they make more of an effort to explain the Black experience rather than live it; in other words, the show is directed toward white people.
It is difficult to tell who “#blackAF” is for. It does spend a lot of time explaining Black history and microaggressions that wouldn’t be news to Black audiences. The Blackness on display frequently comes off as performative and obtrusive overcompensation. These segments often feel like they mainly exist as cliffnotes for white audiences who might be unfamiliar with history and need to be taught about their own failures to combat racism. 
White audiences, however, will have trouble identifying their own racial faux pas in the show’s white characters. Most are total caricatures, over the top and easily dismissed with a simple “Oh, well I’m not that bad.” 
Many of the issues raised feel shallow as well, such as one instance where Joya spends an entire episode afraid that her kids aren’t Black enough because they don’t know how to dance.
“Black-ish” often relied on the acting chops and charisma of Anthony Anderson to bring out the fun of its flawed lead character. While certainly a talented writer, Barris lacks the magnetism and comedic talent needed to elevate his mostly flat performance. Seasoned comic actress Jones brings plenty of life to the character Joya, and it’s clear she’s having a good time. Unlike Barris, she’s fun to watch.
For the most part, though, the characters are mean and hard to get behind. There’s a lack of the clear, unconditional love that typically anchors family shows, and it’s not questioned until the last few episodes — long after viewers may have decided to check out. This is unfortunate, because “#blackAF” does begin to hit somewhat of a stride in the latter half of the season, as Barris displays a rare vulnerability in exploring the challenges and failures of both his career and marriage. It’s a shame that it takes so long to get there.
The show’s mockumentary format often lends itself to entertaining comedic moments and interesting insight. But ultimately, “#blackAF” fails to take full advantage of this format — one that offers a greater opportunity for self-reflection and awareness than typically afforded by sitcoms. The narration at times feels handholdy and Disney channel-esque, not trusting its audience to find the message that has been laid out for them over the past 30 minutes.
In some shining moments, it becomes clear that Barris has a genuine love for his community. “#blackAF” is another attempt to allow Black families to find themselves on screen. It’s just a shame that this exact portrayal has been done before — by its same creator — and rarely attempts to differentiate itself. 
In attempts to express this love of Blackness, “#blackAF” often overdoes it, coming across as performative and unaware, and reducing such a varied experience into generalizations and a few clunkily-inserted uses of African American Vernacular English. While not inherently destructive, “#blackAF” feels late to the conversation, addressing topics that have been tackled time and time again, offering no unique perspective and struggling to justify its existence in today’s TV landscape.

When men across the country went off to fight in the Second World War, women filled the gap they left in the labor force — as a temporary measure, of course. 
Well, as it turned out, we never looked back. Women’s roles continued to expand in the postwar era, and what was once a compensatory shift quickly evolved into a persisting societal norm. That’s not the only occurrence of its kind; in fact, wars and pandemics tend to bring with them large-scale changes that otherwise might not have breached the mainstream. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, for one, the idea of universal basic income has transitioned from fringe to buzzword status. 
There is a cultural equivalent to this situation: In times like these, veils are lifted and bare, ugly truths are revealed. When the economy is at a standstill and we are collectively forced to hole up in our homes, class inequality becomes impossible to ignore and pandering can’t do much to offset that. Among the social impacts of the virus, as one New York Times article so aptly put it, “is its swift dismantling of the cult of celebrity.” 
Yup, celebrities are on the chopping block, and no, that’s not hyperbole — #eattherich and #guillotine2020 have become rallying cries of the digital generation. I mentioned in a column earlier this year that growing anti-capitalist sentiment has led to criticism of the highly-publicized lives of the rich and famous. People were already fed up, and quarantine just might have been the straw that broke the camel’s back.
Shockingly, a recently-deleted Instagram post from Kylie Jenner sending us her “love and prayers” in a pair of $2,000 Dior Jordan 1’s isn’t the light at the end of the tunnel we were looking for. Surprisingly, Gal Gadot telling us that “staying home is her superpower” from her walk-in closet is not easing our existential stress. Oh, and plot twist: Celebrities’ joint cover of “Imagine” by John Lennon was incredibly tone-deaf — in more ways than one: Turns out that the sheer presence of celebrities didn’t cure all our ailments and we don’t want millionaires singing to us about “no possessions” in a period of acute financial stress whose reverberations will likely alter the course of our careers and lives. Who’d have thought?
Celebrities “are stuck inside, but can’t read the room”, as The Guardian eloquently pointed out. As I would put it, the divide between the celebrity ideal and the masses has never been more obvious. The famous have long played the role of “ambassadors of the meritocracy” by serving as success stories of the American Dream and the pursuit of wealth through talent and hard work, yadda yadda. They are not the richest of Americans by a long stretch, but they have often acted as a middle ground between the elite and the masses, with a unique ability to be both unattainable and relatable. 
That idea has always been a thinly veiled charade, sure, but it is clear now that it has disintegrated altogether, giving way to the realization that, no, we’re actually not “all in this together” and, no, not all of us can afford to “stay positive” all the time. Some are unemployed, late on rent and trapped in crowded, conflict-ridden apartments while others are sitting pretty in heavily-staffed palatial mansions. All that considered, corny one-liners and awful song covers aren’t doing much to convince us we’re all facing the same beast.  
I hope I’m not overgeneralizing, but there’s something to be said about Madonna calling this pandemic “The Great Equalizer” from a bathtub filled with rose petals. I mean, come on. 
In fact, this all feels strangely and poetically ironic coming off “Parasite”’s (2019) legendary Best Picture win at this year’s Oscars. For those who haven’t seen it, the film tells the story of how a poor South Korean family cons their way into a rich home, shedding light on the vapid nature of the uber-wealthy without missing a beat. Its powerful message of class warfare, as one Twitter critic put it, was that “when you try to beat capitalism at its own game, you’ll always shed more blood of the working class than the elite.” 
The rich ate “Parasite”  up, lauding its astute social commentary without realizing — doy! — that they embody the same invulnerability and obliviousness that characterized the wealthy Park family. In a sense, that’s what’s happening now: Over the course of this pandemic, celebrities have tried to embed themselves in a narrative of sacrifice and resilience that is humorously misplaced. It’s like that one scene in the movie where a flood destroys the Kim family’s home while the Park family laments they can’t go camping anymore because of the rain — highly metaphorical, uncomfortably disparate and impossible to forget. 
I brought up the role of women in the workforce in WWII to introduce the idea that initially reactive changes can become instrumental to a system, a country or an ideology. Only time will tell whether the widespread disillusionment toward celebrities is a temporary coping mechanism or a permanent cultural shift. 
I don’t know what I believe, but I do think that this might be the end of “We Are the World”-esque pandering. Hey, it’s a small victory, but a good one and likely not the only positive one that will come of this mess.

As students attend classes online and have seen most of their social activities canceled, it’s easy for the days of the week to all blend together. Don’t even get me started on remembering the calendar date. 
But if there’s one day to not only remember but never forget, it’s today. It’s the 27th day of the Jewish month of Nissan: Israel’s Holocaust Remembrance Day. 
For many Jews, the day is not a day of history; it’s one of memory. Our families were gathered up, forced into labor camps, starved, experimented on, murdered and discarded without proper burials. Today’s Jewish population would be over double the current number were it not for the Holocaust. 
Just over a year ago, I traveled to Poland and saw the concentration and death camps myself. I saw the conditions the Nazis forced Jews to live in, the bunkers and  inhumane bathrooms. I saw the items stolen from my relatives before they were murdered: shoes, suitcases, jewelry, clothes, even their own hair. I bore witness to the gas chambers, ovens where my family’s bodies were burned, the mountain ashes that once contained the souls of my relatives. These observations were not museum artifacts for me. They were memories of my family. 
But what moved me most was not any of these horrific sights. It was a memorial sculpture in the center of Warsaw. I remember standing there in the below-freezing weather long after sunset. Before me the “Monument to the Ghetto Heroes” stood, a memorial constructed in 1948 using material the Nazis ordered in anticipation for their victory monument. It depicts the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. 
The Jewish identity is not synonymous with victimhood. It’s one of triumph and perseverance. In fact, today, the day of remembrance, has a special significance: It is the anniversary of the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, when a Jewish resistance force, led by Mordecai Anielewicz, surprised the Nazis on the day they were set to begin liquidating the ghetto and its prisoners. The uprising, which lasted a month, forced Nazi soldiers in the beginning to retreat outside the ghetto . The Jews knew they stood no chance against a disciplined army, but their resistance is a testament to their courage and bravery.  
Today is not just “Holocaust Remembrance Day.” The day’s full name is “Holocaust and Heroism Remembrance Day.” Too often we forget to emphasize the latter portion of the name. Held year after year on the anniversary of the Uprising, the day is not just for commemorating the murdered victims. Today, we also cherish the survivors and the resistors. We thank those who chose to risk their lives to save those who would have otherwise perished.
There’s a lot to take away from the memorial day during these alarming times. There are, of course, the overarching morals to resist injustice at its inception, to practice love and not hate and to keep bearing testimony. These are important lessons every child should be taught. 
But rarely are children taught to look at survivors as more than victims whose fates could have been prevented. Survivors are so much more than that. We would be lucky to display a mere fraction of the perseverance they exhibited. 
It is only fitting that this be the last column of my undergraduate career, one that has had its highs and lows, and one that ends on a grim note with an opaque future. 
As the famous saying goes, “the same water that softens the potato also hardens the egg.” In other words, it’s the person’s character — not their circumstances — that defines their outcome. So as we continue the fight against the coronavirus and are forced to physically distance ourselves from loved ones, we must keep moving forward as the Holocaust survivors did: in the spirit of perseverance, not victimhood.

While sheltering in place, some students have spent the whole day on Netflix, some have caved and joined TikTok and some of us have posted one too many Instagram chains. Others have kept up with coronavirus headlines exclusively through Twitter trends, and some through The New York Times’ live updates. In any case, many students have been spending more time than usual on social media and the internet. 
This can be a good thing. In a time of great uncertainty, students can count on the inevitable Zoom memes to provide temporary distraction and relief. However, with the constant stream of media regarding the pandemic, it is now more important than ever before to be critical consumers of information.
Social media and the internet have never been the epitome of reliability in regard to many issues, and the coronavirus has proved to be no exception. Indeed, the internet has been the root of many conspiracy theories about the virus’s origin, false symptoms and misguided anger toward Asians and Asian Americans. This misinformation is so widespread that some workers from the World Health Organization have been tasked to battle not the pandemic but the spread of inaccurate information.
USC’s student population has proven to be no less susceptible to the impacts of what WHO is calling the “infodemic.” Back in January, there was a false alarm about a coronavirus case at The Lorenzo apartment complex near USC. A video showing emergency vehicles at the scene quickly began to circulate on social media. The panic escalated when Chance Kidd, then general manager of the complex, sent out an email informing residents that a resident had tested positive for the virus. 
This incident shows the possible speed and extent of the spread of false information on the internet. By the time the coronavirus case at The Lorenzo was confirmed false by the USC Department of Public Safety later that night, a “cancel school” petition on Change.org had already gained almost 10,000 signatures. The false alarm caused unnecessary panic that may have been avoided had students taken time to look into the situation before telling all of their followers on Instagram about it. While one can hope that media is fact-checked in the first place, the reality is that it is often the responsibility of consumers to critically analyze the given information.
While the petition’s goal did not come to fruition at the time, there are many other ways in which misinformation can lead to real and harmful consequences. As the coronavirus continued to spread, so did the confusion. After the false alarm at The Lorenzo, some students took to Facebook to post xenophobic memes targeting Chinese American students and Chinese international students at USC. 
In an email sent to the student body in mid-March, then Undergraduate Student Government President Trenton Stone addressed the xenophobic attitude adopted not only by some students on campus but by people around the world.
“Remember that anyone can get and spread COVID-19, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, etc.,” he said in his message. “Racism, xenophobia, and similar stigmatizing behaviors are unwelcome and directly contradict our collective mission to create a safe and inclusive environment for all of our students. Please speak out against hateful rhetoric wherever possible.”
This is not to say all information on the internet and social media is untrustworthy or untrue. Platforms such as YouTube and Facebook have said they will be working closely with the WHO to point users toward accurate information about the virus. The Daily Trojan has also been committed to providing updates about the coronavirus situation on campus to University stakeholders. 
However, it is important to know that students must be critical of any information consumed to effectively combat the “infodemic.” In the age of the coronavirus, a critical gaze of the media may be as valuable as hand sanitizer or toilet paper.

Jalen Green, ESPN’s top 2020 high school basketball prospect in the country, announced Thursday that he would forego a college basketball career to sign a $500,000 G League contract instead. Green’s decision to monetize his talents is seemingly a crushing blow for the NCAA, which has been considered the best option for top prospects since the one-and-done rule was implemented in 2006. 
But if more high-profile prospects follow Green’s lead and spurn the NCAA, college basketball might just return back to what made the league so great in the first place.
Green’s decision to play in the G League did not occur in a vacuum. In recent years, due to the emergence of high school prospects who are more physically gifted and possess more developed skill sets than ever before, a groundswell of support has emerged in opposition to the one-and-done rule.
When the NBA’s efforts to abolish the rule stalled last year, Commissioner Adam Silver, who has vocally opposed the rule, spearheaded the creation of $500,000 Select G League contracts intended to attract the nation’s top prospects. 
Green’s decision to pursue a Select Contract might mark the beginning of a broader trend. Only one day after his decision, No. 14 prospect Isaiah Todd joined Green and decommitted from the University of Michigan to sign his own Select Contract.
Since news of Green’s decision to sign a G League contract broke, much has been made about the tension between the NBA, which has a vested interest in securing the rights to top prospects right after their high school graduation, and the NCAA, which has openly defended the one-and-done rule and depends on one-and-done players for its high-end talent. 
“I think the NBA is doing it as a big middle finger to the NCAA,” an anonymous NBA agent said per Yahoo Sports. “This is how it’s going to be, we’re going to take control of the development of top players.”
However, rather than dwelling on the highly rated players that college basketball will lose out on, the NCAA and its fans should welcome the decline of one-and-done prospects who play college basketball for a single season and then depart as soon as they are eligible for the NBA.
The players who make the greatest contributions to the sport aren’t the prospects who pass in and out of the college ranks for one year at a time but those who commit themselves to a program for multiple years.
In terms of players’ talent level and the pure quality of basketball, college hoops will never be able to compete with the NBA no matter how many talented high school players come through. Instead, what makes college basketball special and what appeals most to its millions of fans across the country is a combination of school spirit, tradition and passion.
Players’ affiliation to the school name on the front of their jerseys will always resonate with fans more than the star power of the last name on the back. Though UCLA is often not the best or most talented opponent on USC’s basketball schedule, the emotion and tradition associated with the crosstown rivalry make it the most attended game at Galen Center every year. 
Though college basketball’s top-end talent would suffer if high school prospects moved en masse to the G League, the intangible features of college basketball that sustain the sport — tradition and fandom — would continue. If anything, due to increased continuity on college basketball teams’ rosters, they might even be enhanced. 
Despite the fact that a few prolific one-and-done players have passed through USC, those who have had the greatest impact on USC basketball are the four-year players that Trojan fans watched steadily improve during their USC careers. I’m talking Jordan McLaughlin, Elijah Stewart, Bennie Boatwright, Jonah Mathews and Nick Rakocevic. These players embody college basketball’s success, and with more players like them, college basketball might get even better.
