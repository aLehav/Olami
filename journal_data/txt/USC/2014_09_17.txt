The specialty grocery store Trader Joe’s is the first confirmed tenant for the new student residential and retail complex, USC Village, a project that officially broke ground on Sept. 15. It will start serving the university community beginning in fall 2017.
Dan Bane, the current chairman and CEO of the company, is a 1969 graduate of USC.
The 12,700-square-foot Trader Joe’s will be on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and Hoover Street. The L.A.-based grocery chain has spread to more than 400 locations in 40 states since 1958.
”We’re excited to be part of the USC Village and we look forward to being a positive addition to the neighborhood in the years to come,” Alison Mochizuki, director of public relations for Trader Joe’s, said.
In a press release, Trader Joe’s said their location at The Village will combine current store aesthetics with community influences.
“The store will feature a festive décor that mixes traditional Trader Joe’s elements such as cedar covered walls and Hawaiian motifs, combined with a local flair that includes art celebrating the neighborhood,”  the company stated in a press release.
Students have expressed interest in the grocery store, as it will greatly expand campus food options.
”I think it’ll be really nice to have a healthy, affordable dining option on campus aside from Seeds,” Harshini Chengareddy, a freshman majoring in global health said.
At the USC Village groundbreaking ceremony on Monday, President C.L. Max Nikias stressed that the campus expansion will serve as an enormous benefit to both the school and surrounding community.
“In the past four years, we have been privileged to break ground on a number of new projects at USC. But this village is an especially historic moment for USC, for our neighborhood and for Los Angeles as a whole,” Nikias said.
In addition to Trader Joe’s, USC Village will include a fitness center, drugstore, Trojan Town USC store, restaurants, parking and a community room. Bank of America and Starbucks coffee will return as well. The project also includes building residence halls for up to 2,700 honors students and a Gothic-style clock tower.
The $650 million project is one of the biggest developments USC has undertaken, along with one of the largest in South Los Angeles’ history. This new development will be built on 15 acres of USC-owned land without public subsidies or taxpayer funds. USC is also providing over $40 million in community benefits and plans to redesign and improve Jefferson Boulevard in the funding of new streets, a new fire station, a law clinic, a small business adviser and ombudsmen.
USC, the largest private employer in Los Angeles, hopes The Village project will create both temporary and permanent jobs in the surrounding community.
 
Is there still 2 phases to this project or has the project been scaled down?  Initially this was going be a 1.1B development. 
Curious as well.  Original plan from a few years ago had this development taking up the land currently occupied by Cardinal Gardens and Century (and if I recall correctly, closing off that part of McClintock).  I wonder if this will still happen eventually.
Yeah, the earlier renderings definitely show redevelopment of Cardinal Gardens area.  I think that phase is still happening down the road, but they’ll need to complete the new student housing at the Village before demolishing Cardinal Gardens & Century.  Also… that new fire station is looking pretty cool.  The whole project is overdue.  I’m looking forward to the changes.

The USC Political Student Assembly and the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics launched the first California Politics Roundtable discussion of the academic year. Topics ranged from healthcare to issues of campaign finance.
Talking for change · Former State Assembly members Anthony Portantino and Audra Strickland offered their views on a variety of topics. – Zhiliang Zhao | Daily Trojan
The panel included former California Assembly members Anthony Portantino (D) and Audra Strickland (R). Portantino also serves as a mentor for the Unruh Institute’s Visiting Fellows Program.
The opening remarks given by the former assembly members included their background, what attracted them to the world of politics and their primary interests. Many of the students present voiced their interest in a future in state and federal politics.
“Don’t run for office because you think you can win,” Portantino advised. “You have to have a passion to change things.  If you don’t have a passion, don’t run — we’re counting on all of you to change it for the better.”
Strickland spoke about her motivations for being involved in politics.
“I love knowing that I can make a difference and that my involvement makes a difference in the political landscape,” she said.
The first topic on the table, health care, was introduced by Strickland as one of her personal passions.
“Health care was one of my biggest concerns when I was in the legislature,” she said.
Portantino followed up with remarks expressing discontent with the federal legislature in failing to act quickly on a common-sense approach to fix the healthcare system.
“It was the author [of the bill] that determined if it was supported or opposed — not the content. Had they spent more time trying to figure out how to make it work, and less time focused on who the author was, maybe they could have come up with a better proposal,” Portantino said.
Another important topic discussed in the roundtable was campaign finance reform.
“I am of the opinion that people should be allowed to give whatever they want to give and have it be disclosed,” Strickland said. She explained that Americans should have the liberty to donate however much they want as a basis for freedom of speech in a democracy.
Portantino had a differing viewpoint.
“What I think we need to strengthen is campaign finance,” he said.
Portantino explained that the current system is broken. He understands, however, that most politicians in the legislature  benefit from the status quo, so there is no incentive to change it. “We need to lower the thresholds, have more regulation of the Super PACs and independent expenditures,” Portantino said.
The panel explained that there are many different loopholes in state laws regarding campaign contributions that certain politicians have taken advantage of. Portantino said some elected officials communicate with potential contributors near the time when a relevant bill is held to a vote.
“There are people who push the limit of that type of behavior,” Portantino said.
The discussion took a turn when Unruh director Dan Schnur asked the students in the roundtable what upset them about the current American political system when they watched the news or picked up a newspaper. In response to Schnur’s query, Ben Hannani, a sophomore majoring in political science, voiced his concern on how the federal government has reacted to high-profile shootings in the past few years.
“There should have been an immediate reaction from our elected officials after the tragedies at Aurora and Sandy Hook — there should be a system in place that can prevent or even attempt to prevent tragedies like that,” Hannani said.
The gun control discussion heated up as additional students voiced their opinions on the topic.
“After listening to [Strickland] express her political ideologies, I felt like I had someone in a position of power that could voice my political thought,” said Shakay Amirkhanyan, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and law, at the conclusion of the debate.
Amirkhanyan mentioned that she was eager to contribute in the first roundtable discussion of the year after enjoying one last spring semester.
“Last semester, I participated in my first roundtable discussion and I found it to be so intellectually enriching that I couldn’t wait for the first round table discussion of the Fall 2014 semester,” she said.
 
Editor’s Note: A paragraph incorrectly describing Ms. Strickland’s attitudes toward the Affordable Care Act was removed. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

The Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences officially installed Professor Robert Shrum as the inaugural Carmen H. and Louis Warschaw Chair in Practical Politics at a reception at Town and Gown on Wednesday afternoon.
Shrum, who was announced as the chair in January, started working at USC in June. He is currently teaching an Applied Politics course titled Great Races: From City Hall to the White House.
The Warschaw Chair was endowed by a donation from the late Carmen Warschaw ’39, a honorary USC Trustee and leading figure in the California Democratic Party.
“This gift allows the Dornsife College to support an outstanding faculty member who bridges the gap between political theory and student involvement in the democratic process,” said Provost and Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs Elizabeth Garrett in her speech on Wednesday.
Shrum, who does not have a Ph.D. degree, will bridge that gap by bringing his extensive experience in politics to students. He is a well-known political consultant who worked on Al Gore’s 2000 presidential campaign and John Kerry’s 2004 run, in addition to 30 victorious U.S. Senate campaigns and eight winning gubernatorial runs. He is well known for writing Sen. Edward Kennedy’s concession speech at the 1980 Democratic National Convention after Kennedy lost the nomination to Jimmy Carter. For the past nine years, he has been working as a professor at New York University.
The chair, which was established in 2008, was not filled until earlier this year as administrators and Hope Warschaw, the daughter of Carmen and Louis, sought to find the right person.
“All of a sudden, it occurred to me that [Shrum] embodied everything my mother was looking for in a chairholder,” Hope Warschaw, who first met Shrum in 1979, said.
Though Carmen Warschaw has since passed away, Hope Warschaw remembered her mother’s commitment to politics.
“Those of you who knew my mother knew she had two great loves besides her family: USC and politics,” Hope Warschaw said.
Shrum, exhibiting his Trojan pride with cardinal-and-gold-striped socks, used his speech to talk about the current state of politics. In addition to praising the qualities of authenticity and candor in politicians, he also spoke about how technology has affected the field.
“In the end, social media may prove to be direct mail on steroids. So while the techniques move on, I believe the device of message endures. To explore that with students … for me this is not a job, but a privilege,” Shrum said.
After Shrum’s remarks, Dornsife dean Steve Kay presented him with an actual chair marked with the seal of the university. Shrum joins 32 other endowed chairs at the Dornsife College.
Shrum will teach three courses a year at USC. In addition to his Applied Politics course and the class he will teach in the spring, Shrum will also be leading a Maymester course in Washington D.C. Shrum has also already begun leading a political speaker series in partnership with the Unruh Institute, another USC institution that has benefited from the Warschaws.
“My parents were instrumental at USC starting the Casden Institute and the Warschaw lecture series, and they helped reenergize the Unruh Institute,” Hope Warschaw said of her parents’ other contributions to the university.
The family and Shrum’s influence were evident at the event. In addition to Dornsife faculty and university administrators, the diverse crowd that came out to honor Shrum included USC Trustee Robert Padgett, Los Angeles County Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas and L.A. County Supervisor candidate Bobby Shriver.
Shrum said he’s the one who is honored by his position, however.
“[USC is] a wonderful place. It is the happening school in L.A., in California and one of the really rising schools in the nation,” Shrum told the Daily Trojan. “It’s an amazing place. I’m privileged to be here.”

More than 200 people attended the recruiting event “LA to the Bay: A Tech Recruitment Event,” held last night in the Annenberg Innovation Lab. The event included a panel discussion and was co-hosted by Girls in Tech USC, the Society of Women Engineers and the Association of Computing Machinery. The event was supported by Blackstone LaunchPad, an entrepreneurship education program.
Connectivity · Companies represented at the “LA to the Bay: A Tech Recruitment Event” included professionals from Facebook, Uber, Blizzard Entertainment and Hulu, who met with students. – Samuel Chang | Daily Trojan
The event began with a panel discussion featuring recruiters and professionals from Facebook, Uber, Blizzard and Hulu. It was moderated by Lauren McGoodwin, a former recruiter at Hulu and founder of Career Contessa, a website geared towards inspiring millennial women. Students also participated in a networking session and submitted their resumes.
Questions during the panel discussion ranged from the interview process to company culture.
“The main purpose of this event is to give students a chance to interact with companies that usually don’t come to campus. This event gives students a more intimate environment to speak with the companies that they really want to work for,” Sara Clayton, founder of the USC chapter of Girls in Tech, said.
Clayton said she wants to build up the alumni network in technology.
“The USC network is already really big and we have a ton of alumni at great places, but I think tech is definitely an emerging network for USC,” she said. “As we have more events like this, we’ll have more alumni at great companies like Facebook and Uber.”
Though almost 700 students RSVP’d for the event on Facebook, only around 200 students were allowed into the venue due to maximum capacity issues.
“I thought it was great,” Calvin LeGassick, a sophomore majoring in computer science, said. “The turnout was much more than I expected. It’s exciting to see students, especially female engineers, come out to recruiting events like this.”
LeGassick also works for Blackstone LaunchPad, whose programs at various universities aim to house and train the next generation of entrepreneurs.
Alex Zhang, a sophomore majoring in business administration, said there were drawbacks to the large amount of student interest in the event.
“The lines are incredibly long, so as each person waits in line and each recruiter meets another person, faces start to combine and the recruiter gets less one-on-one time with each individual student,” he said. “It was definitely good publicity for the organizing companies since they were able to attract top students and top companies to come here at USC to speak.”
Zhang was interested in the panel discussion of the various company cultures.
“Facebook emphasized that their brand was at the top of their priority list, and they really wanted to emphasize that their goal was to make the world a more connected place, and if you didn’t have that mission in mind, then you’re probably not the best fit for Facebook,” Zhang said.
Clayton chose to team up with SWE and ACM because she said they are the powerhouse groups of the Viterbi School of Engineering.
“SWE is a very female-forward organization, and I think one of the main issues in tech is that there aren’t enough females, so a lot of companies are making the effort to recruit members from SWE and Girls in Tech,” she said. “These companies want to bring more women in tech and increase their diversity.”
Zhang also commented on the demographics of the students who attended.
“I saw a lot of graduate students and a lot of first generation students, which was really interesting because I thought the companies here would attract a larger array of more diverse students,” he said. “I am pretty confident that this event had about 70 percent graduate students, which I thought was interesting since I originally thought companies like Facebook and Uber would attract younger demographics like myself.”
Zhang said some of his friends left because they felt discouraged sitting alongside very experienced graduate students.
“I am definitely looking into hosting another event like this in the future. We would definitely need a bigger venue,” Clayton said.

There are hits scattered throughout Chris Brown’s sixth studio album, X. However, it is hard to escape the feeling that it is yet another disingenuous effort with the sole goal of being on the radio, rather than striving for musical expression. There are a myriad of high profile artists on the album, ranging from Kendrick Lamar to Akon. But even they couldn’t save X from Brown’s lack of lyricism.
As if to alert his audience that he has not changed at all, these are the opening lines of Brown’s newest album: “If you’re only as good as the company you keep / Then I’mma blame you for what they say about me.” These self-centered lyrics draw attention to some of his negative media appearances, the most notable of which was the beating of his then-girlfriend Rihanna. These lines are an interesting yet uninspired start to the album that are a stark indication of its entire direction.
Most of the songs on the album are about sex, which does little to help the world forget about Chris Brown’s controversial past. Despite this, there are glimpses of reflection scattered throughout, such as on “Do Better.”
 
Brown sings, “I’m starting to hate me/A little more and more each day/I don’t know me/It’s like I can’t get out of my own way.” This is an intriguing contrast to his radio hit “Loyal,” which proclaims that “These h-es ain’t loyal.”
The featured artists on this album are perhaps the biggest highlight. Kendrick Lamar lays down a crisp verse on “Autumn Leaves,” and R. Kelly gives a dependable performance on “Drown In It,” but some of the best work on the album is from its female collaborators.
Brandy, Ariana Grande, Jhené Aiko and Aaliyah all have vocals on various tracks on the album, and the female influence does a lot to soften the vulgar edge of Chris Brown’s career and music. These women all have a soft vocal style that contributes to the latter half of the album’s distinctly personal and introspective selection of tracks. If the opening songs of the album are about Brown’s mistakes, the closing ones are his apologies.
Let’s be honest — Chris Brown has a history of misogyny and abuse that makes it hard to trust his intentions for the 21 tracks on the deluxe version ofX. After his abuse scandal with Rihanna, fights with Drake, Frank Ocean and even fans, and a stint in rehab, Chris Brown is still on a long road to recovery. Unfortunately, most of his songs don’t reflect on his very public past, and instead mimic the same old Chris Brown tracks we’ve been hearing for years. This lack of overall personal reflection, despite the more promising second half, is why the album leaves its audience with a surprisingly shallow feeling.
The production in most of the tracks is a saving grace, with some high profile producers like Diplo. But with a variety of producers comes a variety of tracks, and, unfortunately for Brown, these tracks don’t flow together well. The first two songs, for example, represent this lack of continuity. “X” is the opening track, and it opens the album perfectly, setting the listener up for a pensive, hopeful album. But the next song, “Add Me In,” quickly shatters that notion with completely ridiculous and unenlightening lyrics like, “Your body’s an isosceles and I just tryna try angles.”
There are a few tracks worth mentioning on X, namely Brown’s collaboration with Kendrick Lamar on “Autumn Leaves.” This track departs from the misogyny of the album and instead presents a brooding story about falling out of love, which sets up the much more real second half of X. If the album started right here, it would be much stronger. With the exception of “X” and maybe “Loyal,” there is not a solid track before “Autumn Leaves.” The album arcs, and afterwards it’s much more soulful, with tracks like “Don’t Be Gone For Too Long” and “See You Around,” in which Brown sings of lost love and heartbreak.
About a month before the album’s release, Chris Brown posted on Instagram that he had “50 songs” to choose from for X, so it’s a shame that these were the ones that made the cut. He also boasted features like Pharrell, Timbaland and others, none of which made it into the album. This leaves me wondering what happened to those tracks. The potential this album had prior to its release was, in my opinion, not at all realized. Though there are some hits, X does not mark the spot.

Excellent culinary experiences are considered a rare treat for most college students whose daily menus usually don’t stray far from ramen and Easy Mac. Those looking to start exploring the vast and varied culinary topography of Los Angeles won’t have to go very far, however. Saint Martha, a cozy new bistro devoted to wine and offering an eclectic international menu opened its doors in a strip mall in Koreatown this past June.
Culinary delight · Saint Martha specializes in meat and seafood dishes. Highlights include the mouthwatering steak and oyster tartare with champagne sabayon as well as bone marrow beignets. – Photo courtesy of Saint Martha
Founded by established Los Angeles restaurateurs Peter and Ellen Picataggio — the couple behind Angeleno favorite TART — and helmed by self-proclaimed hipster chef Nick Erven, Saint Martha offers exquisite small plates and an extensively curated wine list in a room that feels like home.
Located in a quiet strip mall on 740 S. Western Ave., patrons can expect to drive right by Saint Martha, maybe twice, before seeing the restaurant’s simple sign and large wooden doors. Inside, the décor is sparse but trendy, with vintage portraits hanging on the walls and a cozy maroon leather bench lining the interior. Patrons can quickly pick up on the nods Saint Martha is giving to the hip Los Angeles culture that led to its creation.
Walking in, customers are greeted by a smile from the chefs working under a neon blue sign reading “Hipster” and an eager hostess asking for a reservation name. The staff at Saint Martha is both attentive and knowledgeable. With precise information on how the food is prepared and great recommendations on the most complementary flavors on the menu, the staff play an important role in the dining and drinking experience.
After ordering, customers are treated to hors d’oeuvres, compliments of the chef. While the specifics will differ depending on the evening, a creative, refreshing and tasty little morsel featuring seasonal produce and a light protein can be expected.
Grand Master Sommelier Mary Thompson has developed an eclectic wine menu featuring over 50 bottles from all over the world, making the bar predominantly wine oriented. Customers have the option to taste, order a carafe or buy a bottle for varying prices.
The menu at Saint Martha is divided into five different sections, not including sweets. The first section, “Snacks,” ranges from $8 to $12 and features one of the stars of the menu: the octopus with koshihikari rice, sauce nero, lardo and espelette. The octopus is tender, flavorful and not at all fishy, it is not intimidating for even the most inexperienced diner, and paired with a creamy risotto style rice this is a must at $12.
Following “Snacks,” Erven created a section of the menu devoted to raw foods aptly titled “Rawesome.” Ranging from $12 to $15, these dishes offer delicious raw appetizers at approachable prices. The steak and oyster tartare with champagne sabayon and bone marrow beignets might be the best thing on the menu. At $13, patrons are given a sizable portion of tartare along with two bone marrow beignets. Refreshingly rich, the two components paired together beautifully. The flavors and textures work together so well that customers at surrounding tables could be heard exclaiming how good the dish was.
If customers are looking for some basic flavors or just a little salad, “Vegetables and Grains” are available from $11 to $13. Saint Martha is certainly not a restaurant for vegetarians, however, as even its veggie dishes usually offer a small seafood or meat protein.
Entrées change daily and are divided into “Fish and Such” and “Meaty Things,” ranging from about $19 to $24. Depending on how hungry the table is, these slightly bigger portions are barely enough to share.
The $23 Hawaiian Snapper with heirloom tomato tartare, pickled eggplant and popcorn purée wowed the entire table. Tender and tasty the fish was the perfect summer choice, paired with sweet fresh tomatoes and a tart pickled eggplant for a refreshing and light dish,
Unfortunately, desserts are not Saint Martha’s forte. A disappointing carrot kamut cake with carrot sorbet and a less than stellar peanut butter ganache with a scoop of grape ice cream that tasted like a Flinstones chewable vitamin ended the meal on a sour note.
For a student who’s looking for a hip and new fine dining experience, Saint Martha’s international fresh and eclectic dinner menu does not disappoint. A meal for three including one glass of wine and selections from each section of the menu came out to be $151.38. Though Saint Martha’s might not be the most affordable, it is a great choice for special occasions or for those willing to shell out a few extra shekels to be on the up and up on great new eateries in Los Angeles.

With just one weekend of non-conference play left before the Pac-12 season kicks off, the USC women’s soccer team is looking to continue their sizzling start and keep fine-tuning the details before conference play commences.
We got the Fink · Junior forward Jamie Fink has netted four goals on the season, good for second on the team. Fink now has 10 career scores. – Brian Ji | Daily Trojan
 
Though the temperatures have been well into the 90s all week, head coach Keidane McAlpine and his staff know that this is no time to take a break, especially after being caught a little off guard in last Sunday’s 1-1 draw against UC Irvine.
“No doubt this has been a grind week,” McAlpine said. “Us coaches have really pushed the girls hard this week, but I think they are going to respond. It’s a little difficult because we’ve been trying to replicate what this past Sunday was like for them by trying to make them uncomfortable and forcing them to really focus and adjust.”
The team hopes that a week of hard work will pay off this weekend, during which they will have two potentially tough home games to close out the non-conference slate. The first will take place this on Friday, when USC will host an Arkansas Pine-Bluff team that has struggled thus far. As such, the Golden Lions will have nothing to lose and everything to prove against the Women of Troy, who currently hold the No. 15 ranking in the NSCAA coaches poll.
When asked about the challenge presented by the Golden Lions, McAlpine was adamant that his team will need to come ready to play.
“We can’t overlook Arkansas Pine-Bluff regardless of what their record is,” McAlpine said. “They are still Division 1 athletes that can hurt us, and so we’ve got to go out with the same intensity as we would every game, especially so we can be prepared for Sunday’s game.”
Two days later, the Women of Troy will face Pepperdine in what could be quite a showdown. USC hosts the No. 12 Waves, who currently hold a 6-1-1 record, in the final non-conference game of the year. The Waves’ only loss came on Sept. 7 at the hands of No. 1 UCLA, by a score of 2-0. They also tied with now-No. 25 ranked Washington State on Sept. 5 and can boast a 1-0 victory over No. 9 North Carolina on Aug. 31.
The matchup with Pepperdine will provide USC with their most formidable foe since a matchup with then-No. 9 Notre Dame on Aug. 31st, which USC won 2-1.
“Pepperdine is a big time game,” McAlpine said. “They are very organized. They’ve had some great results … and they beat us last year. It’s a game where we are really going to have to be locked in and disciplined and play efficiently and work for the entire game.”
Lynn Williams, who has already scored five times this season to go with her two assists, leads the Waves’ offensive attack. Williams is helped by her striking partner Taylor Alvarado, who is the only other player on the team with multiple goals.
USC senior goalkeeper Caroline Stanley will do her best to stifle Williams and the Pepperdine offense. Stanley has been a brick wall so far this season, recording 20 saves and allowing only  five goals in the team’s seven games.
The Waves’ defense is anchored by goalkeeper Hannah Seabert, who has also run a tight ship this season. Seabert has only allowed five goals in the team’s eight games.
The Women of Troy’s goal-scorers will attempt to break through this tough Pepperdine defense. Senior midfielder Alex Quincey leads the team with five goals, while junior midfielder Jamie Fink is close behind with four. Junior Tamara Mejia leads the team in assists with three.
Though keeping the Waves at bay will be no easy task, there is reason to believe that the Women of Troy are up to the task.
“No doubt it has been a tough week, but we are going to be prepared,” McAlpine said. “We are a very talented team, and I expect us to come out and play well this weekend.”
Friday’s matchup against the Golden Lions will roar to life at 3 p.m., while the Sunday showdown with Pepperdine will start at 3:30 p.m. Both games will be played at McAlister Field, and for those who are on the fence about attending: the first 100 students that arrive to the game Friday will receive a free hamburger from the Lobos Food Truck, and Sunday’s game will feature $1 hot dogs for every fan in attendance.
The Women of Troy begin play in the treacherous Pac-12 conference next week, starting with a road trip to play Arizona on Thursday, Sept. 26.

Well, we finally figured out what it takes to get suspended from the Florida State football team.
Jameis Winston, the No. 1 Seminoles’ Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, will not suit up for the first half of the team’s battle with No. 22 Clemson this Saturday. Winston was suspended following reports that he yelled obscenities at fellow students while standing atop a table inside FSU’s student union.
The redshirt sophomore apologized for his “selfish act,” accepted his punishment, and will watch as the nation moves on. Just as he did when he was cleared of a sexual assault charge under questionable circumstances. Just as he did when he avoided suspension for shoplifting from a grocery store last spring. And just as he will do as long as he’s playing quarterback for Florida State.
I doubt the Seminoles’ coaching staff will receive much criticism regarding Winston’s suspension. Their punishment was laid down quickly, and actually was a punishment, which is new for them. Hell, head coach Jimbo Fisher and his staff might even receive some praise — they weren’t forced to suspend Jameis, and the Tigers are slated to be FSU’s only ranked conference opponent this season. In fact, I can hear Fisher defending his honorable decision right now…
Guys, we’re really cracking down on our team’s behavioral problems. We suspended Jameis for the Clemson game! Well, half of it. But that’s what, at least six or seven possessions? Plus, Clemson’s our toughest opponent of the year! Well, after Notre Dame and probably Oklahoma State. But Clemson’s in the ACC, and they’re really good! Well, we did beat them 51-14 last year while they still had Tajh Boyd and Sammy Watkins, but hey, they put up a fight against Georgia, didn’t they? And they really took it to South Carolina State last week…
Ok, we all know this “suspension” is a joke. Jameis got in trouble again, and the coaching staff knew it couldn’t continue to let its best player avoid punishment for fear of legitimate public scrutiny. Something had to be done — I mean, something had to be done as long as it didn’t actually cost the Seminoles a win. The solution? Suspending him for half the game!
It’s genius really; Winston’s latest screw-up came during the week of a “tough” matchup, so it wouldn’t be fair to keep him out for the whole game. It’s a win-win — the public is appeased, FSU looks like its finally taking off-the-field issues seriously and the football team (remember, that’s what’s important here) only loses its fearless leader for half of a key ACC matchup. After all, the Tigers really did beat up on South Carolina State last week.
All joking aside, there is a serious issue at play here. More serious than swearing at coeds while mimicking a YouTube clip, more serious than stealing crab legs, more serious than anything Winston has ever done. As deeply flawed as he is, “Famous Jameis” has been consistently enabled and supported by the Florida State football program, its boosters and, by extension, the university itself.
We don’t know if Jameis Winston raped a Florida State freshman in December 2012. As Walt Bogdanich laid out in his excellent New York Times piece from last April, that’s not because of any lack of evidence. The victim in the case identified Winston as her attacker and has not backed away from that claim. Mysteriously — or, if you’re a cynic like me, not mysteriously at all — law enforcement did a remarkably poor job investigating the case, which was later dropped. According to Bogdanich, “the police did not follow the obvious leads that would have quickly identified the suspect as well as witnesses, one of whom videotaped part of the sexual encounter.”
Perhaps even more concerning, university officials also failed to immediately follow up on the complaint, a possible violation of federal law.
Through all this ugliness, which has been documented before by writers better than myself, one fact remains: Jameis got away with it. He was not punished by the football team after being accused of rape, nor after his attempted theft. This week’s slap on the wrist notwithstanding, Winston will most likely head to the NFL scot-free. And that’s not his fault. Yes, his actions have been despicable, and hopefully one day justice will find him. But the fact that he’s getting away with those actions? Blame that on the institution that continues to shield him, and on the grown adults that continue to place more importance on winning football games than on the character of their players. Blame that on the men that force a young woman to pick up the pieces while her alleged rapist runs around on national TV every Saturday.
Obviously, Florida State has a Jameis Winston problem. The young man has made some terrible decisions that should never be defended. But once he gets out of the sick, supportive-to-a-fault FSU bubble, he will have to face the real world. And if I have to guess, that won’t go well. So perhaps the script needs to be flipped. Perhaps, even more tragically, Jameis Winston has a Florida State problem.

I think what this points out is the habitual nature of acting badly. And with no real  consequences is rewarded when all is said and done. It just sets up the next bad ‘act’ to be excused. I am sure with just a little more investigation into the NFL’s current PR fiasco would reveal past bad behavior by those in hot water now. It is not limited the FSU or the NFL or sports, it sadly is endemic to our society.

The USC football team is moving past its tough defeat at Boston College and focusing on ways to improve as a team during this bye week. Having the week off has allowed the team to dial in on fundamentals and come together with the goal of returning to playoff contention.
Two-way street · USC freshman wide-receiver/defensive back Adoree’ Jackson was named the team’s Player of the Day at practice on Wednesday. Jackson has recorded three total tackles, two of them for loss, so far this season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Making Adjustments
Head coach Steve Sarkisian sees the week off as a way to prepare his team for the rest of the season and to fix any problems that might have come up in earlier weeks. He stressed being experimental with his schemes and personnel and mentioned that the team is focused on returning to the fundamentals of the game and minimizing mistakes.
“Bye week is always unique because you’re trying to fix some of the issues that you have and what you have previously installed,” the first-year coach said. “We looked at a few different schemes today that I’ll have to look at the film to see how they look and how they mesh with what we’re doing, but the guys worked hard.”
Sarkisian also responded to those who criticized his play-calling and decision-making against BC.
“I’ve had worse games than scoring 31 points before,” he said.
That being said, Sarkisian knows that there are always aspects of the game that can be improved.
“After every game, win or lose, I analyze myself first as the head coach and as the play caller,” Sarkisian said. “Inevitably after every game you think, ‘Boy, we played great,’ but there’s always five to 10 calls where I say, ‘You know, if I did that again, I’d call that play differently there.’ Obviously those things get magnified when you don’t win.”
Sarkisian also discussed the significance of not being a one-dimensional team and emphasized the versatility of the team’s best athletes, including sophomore defensive back Su’a Cravens.
“Su’a [Cravens] is a guy who can create turnovers, he can make tackles in the backfield, he can blitz off the edge, he can cover well,” Sarkisian said. “I think he’s at his best when he’s around the ball.”
Getting Back on Track
Not only has this week off given the Trojans much needed rest, but it has also allowed freshman wide receiver Ajene Harris to reestablish himself as a formidable threat in the offensive system.
“I think this week for him has kind of gotten him back to training camp mode, which is when he really impressed us,” Sarkisian explained. “We’ve refocused on Ajene [Harris] this week and its shown up again, his toughness and his playmaking ability.”
Having Harris back in the fold on offense has also let junior wide receiver Nelson Agholor return to his more natural position on the outside after more recently being utilized in the slot.
“Ajene [Harris] keeps fighting for playing time, and he’s had a great attitude,” Sarkisian said. “We’ve moved Nelson [Agholor] some back outside this week, and we’ve seen his playmaking again on the perimeter.”
Kryptonite
Freshman cornerback Adoree’ Jackson might have his share of nicknames to choose from if he continues his impressive play. Jackson was called the “player of the day” by his coach, who also referred to his freshman as the kryptonite to the offense. Jackson caused three turnovers in one period during practice, forcing two fumbles and intercepting a pass.
This kind of play characterizes how the younger guys have responded to the loss in practice this week.
Redshirt senior inside linebacker Hayes Pullard said that his younger teammates have moved on from the loss and are responding to the model set by the veterans and coaching staff.
“They’re not worried about the loss. They know that doesn’t determine if we go to the national championship or not,” Pullard said. “We have to take it one game at a time and win out in the [Pac-12 South].”

This Friday, Chinese Internet commerce company Alibaba will debut its initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. It is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the year, and one of the most hotly contested in recent memory. The company is expected to raise around $25 billion in investments, which would be the biggest IPO in U.S. history. Before discussing some of the risks and dangers of trading with Alibaba, it’s important to clarify what exactly this Chinese behemoth does.
Many have compared Alibaba to Amazon and eBay combined. That might sound daunting — and it is. In reality, Alibaba most resembles eBay in its consumer auction site and its online payment system, which is similar to PayPal, called Alipay. Alibaba’s business is heavily diversified. It runs a service like Amazon under the name Tmall. Despite Alibaba’s many services, much of its revenue stems from Taobao, China’s largest online shopping service, and Alibaba.com, an online network that connects Chinese exporters with merchants around the world. It’s easy to see the lucrative value in a company such as Alibaba. Yet, a closer look at the dealings of the company and its presence in the U.S. stock market reveals that China’s sweetheart tech company might not be the darling Americans think it is.
In 2010, Alibaba’s founder and chairman Jack Ma gave controlling interest of Alipay to a group he was a part of in order to comply with Chinese central bank regulations. American groups like Yahoo! and SoftBank Corp believe this was a conflict of interest because Ma had been forming deals that benefited groups outside of Alibaba that he’s a part of, blurring the line between public market and private holdings. Additionally, Ma and others borrowed $1 billion to invest in Chinese television and cable. As one portfolio manager put it, “Alibaba’s balance sheet is being used to finance an acquisition by Jack Ma and others.” The overall trend in Alibaba and Ma’s business dealings paint a picture that depicts insider trading, the use of company funds to invest in other business opportunities without the consent or basic knowledge of shareholders.
In light of Alibaba’s IPO rise from $66 to $68 per share, some have argued that the risk involved in investing is negligible because the company has so much room for expansion. What those voices fail to recognize is that Alibaba is a foreign company, meaning that it is not eligible to trade on the S&P 500 index, where it could have more of an impact on the overall market. Alibaba is not even taking the lead of Baidu or other Chinese companies to trade on the NASDAQ, where most American tech companies like Apple and Facebook trade.
Make no mistake, Alibaba is surging. It hopes to command a market value of up to $167.6 billion, 29 times more than estimates for yearly earnings. The issue with Alibaba resides in its murky business practices and nascent presence in U.S. markets.
In China, Alibaba will continue to dominate, but abroad, the company will have to understand the subtleties of the U.S. market and consumers while competing with other tech companies like Netflix and Amazon. Let the buyer beware. Time will tell if Alibaba will perform well on the NYSE and demand a share price it so adamantly believes it can live up to.

Move over, Ice Bucket Challenge — there’s a new controversial campaign in town, and it’s taking the Internet by storm. Undercover Colors, a nail polish line designed to detect common date-rape drugs, was an idea proposed by four North Carolina State University students to help empower women to defend themselves against possible sexual assault.

The all-male group is currently raising funds to further develop their prototype, but the initial widespread acclaim and support turned sour in late August when anti-rape advocates openly denounced Undercover Colors, insisting the product will only propagate the very rape culture it intends to eradicate.
To the typical consumer, this backlash might seem like nothing more than an overreaction to the unwarranted complaints of a bunch of insatiable ultra-feminists, but these women make a valid argument.
There’s no denying that the founders of Undercover Colors mean well. According to a Newsweek article, co-founder Ankesh Madan revealed in an interview with Higher Education Works why the group chose to focus on this particular issue.
“All of us have been close to someone who has been through the terrible experience,” Madan said. “[And] we began to focus on finding a way to help prevent the crime.”
The idea is certainly a step in the right direction for sexual assault prevention, and carrying around some sort of self-defense object can be comforting for a woman living in a world of sexual predation. Yet, the continued development of this sort of product might not actually do anything to eradicate rape culture.
For one thing, the technology itself might not be advanced enough for the product to truly be effective. The anonymous medical columnist at Animal New York — who writes under the pen name “Backdoor Pharmacist” — says that most products claiming to detect date rape drugs are not reliable and cites the results of several studies as evidence for this claim. The columnist goes on to point out that there are simply too many different drugs out there for any product of this nature to be failsafe; no matter how much funding Undercover Colors might receive, it would be nearly impossible to invent a product capable of identifying every drug used to involuntarily alter a subject’s consciousness.
Technology aside, Undercover Colors gets the statistics of rape wrong. When juxtaposed with the reality of rape in the United States, the notions fueling products such as Undercover Colors seem too naive. For one thing, the most common date rape drug is alcohol itself, which is a common beverage at many party or bar scenarios.
Moreover, the image of a college rapist as a random stranger is a complete misconception. One in Four, a nonprofit organization advocating for sexual assault awareness and prevention, provides a list of sexual assault statistics on its website, compiled from various censuses and medical journals. According to the webpage, 60 percent of victims of on-campus sexual assault considered their attackers “acquaintances.”
In shifting the burden of rape prevention to women, Undercover Colors also undermines the female empowerment it seeks to promote. Saddling women with the responsibility to prevent their own sexual assault is harmful on multiple levels, which is why Katie Russell from Rape Crisis England & Wales refuses to endorse the product.
“Whilst Undercover Color’s initiative is well meaning, on the whole, Rape Crisis does not endorse or promote such a product or anything similar,” Russell explained to Newsweek. “This is for three reasons: it implies that it’s the woman’s fault and assumes responsibility on her behalf, and detracts from the real issues that arise from sexual violence.”
The Guardian columnist Jessica Valenti points out that Undercover Colors is also ineffective in its tendency to “leave room for victim-blaming” when women do not take these preventive measures. This “victim-blaming” completely negates all the work that crisis centers like Russell’s aim to accomplish. The main purpose of centers like these is to provide support for victims and assure them it was not their fault. Assault-prevention products leave room for victims to feel as if they could have done more to avoid their current plight, when it should not have been their responsibility in the first place.
In the words of Valenti, “We should be trying to stop rape, not just individually avoid it.” This is really the crux of the issue, the heart of this alarmingly prevalent problem. There’s nothing wrong with carrying a bottle of pepper spray on one’s keychain, but not much will change for the better until society finally holds perpetrators accountable for their actions and educates men and women about the reality of sexual assault.
 
Just because it isn’t an end-all-be-all solution shouldn’t stop people from trying it.  That’s like telling auto mechanics that they don’t need a hammer because a hammer won’t fix every problem.  Just another tool in the toolbelt for women to protect themselves in today’s society.  It won’t help everyone, that is for sure, but if it saves even a single person then I consider that a success.
