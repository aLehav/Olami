In an effort to promote his “Made in Ghana” campaign, Ghanaian President John Dramani Mahama visited Wallis Annenberg Hall on Thursday in an event hosted by the Center on Public Diplomacy to discuss his country’s local products.
In his introduction, Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Dean Ernest J. Wilson III spoke briefly about the Ghanaian president’s distinguished career in governance and emphasized his previously held position of minister of communication and his master’s degree in communication studies.
“We welcome you back home in the field of communication,” Wilson said.
The “Made in Ghana” campaign, which  launched in 2014, stemmed from Mahama’s goal to better inform the international community about Ghana and its products. In his remarks, Mahama discussed Ghana’s production of gold and timber, which drives export income and its national economy. He also highlighted Ghana’s more cultural exports which “gave the world” products such as the Dashiki, a brightly colored tunic native to West Africa.
“Our culture, our people and our products are widespread and received with enthusiasm and appreciation,” Mahama said. “Yet I noticed there was often no immediate association in people’s minds of those things to our country.”
Mahama also noted how Ghana has become the second-largest exporter of cacao only two decades after the end of colonial rule.
Mahama decided to come to Los Angeles after a friend told him about the Pasadena-based ice cream company Choctál, which sells chocolate ice cream made from the cacao harvested in small family-owned farms in Ghana.
Mahama said that the “Made in Ghana” campaign aims to not only a boost the local economy, but also to reinforce national identity and distinguish Ghana from other African countries.
“We’re planning a major launch of the campaign,” Mahama said, “We are branding Ghana and putting a seal on our products. We encourage Ghanaians to patronize our products [and] at the same time sell our products to the world.”
Mahama also spoke about democracy in Ghana and the role of the media in Ghanaian society.
“It’s not the easiest job to have — to be Ghana’s president,” he said. “Ghana has one of the most free landscapes of media in the world … It unleashes the creativity of our people, and people are able to say what they want to say. We value free expression, freedom of speech. We have made significant progress with more than two decades of positive growth.”
Students said they were excited to hear Mahama speak.
“As a Ghanaian myself, it is very awesome to [be able to] ask him a question and just be in the same room with him,” said Stephanie Kuwornu, a sophomore majoring in economics. “It’s a rare opportunity for university students to be able to meet world leaders … It makes me think about what I can do for my country and my own personal vision as it reinforces my personal values.”
This appreciation was shared by first-year master’s in public diplomacy student Yesenia Vargas, who focuses her research on West Africa.
“We’ve seen a lot of attention on Ghana in terms of how [Mahama] can implement the ‘Made in Ghana’ without trying to seem like he’s being [a protectionist],” Vargas said. “There’s minor criticism when furniture from the office of the government just [comes] from Italy and China ,but seeing how he’s trying to promote the individuality of Ghana and differentiate it from the assumption of the western world that Africa is this one whole uniform thing, is a positive movement. I think he can find a lot of support for that here.”
This post has been updated to reflect that the event was hosted by the Center on Public Diplomacy.

Under the guidance of Steven Lamy, vice dean for academic programs and professor of international relations, Dornsife has created an inaugural preceptor program for postdoctoral humanities and social sciences students.
Applications for this program opened in February, and doctorate students began their contracts with USC this semester.
“This post-doctorate position allows students to be mentored by faculty and also teach their own course,” Lamy said. “We wanted them to teach one course each semester and then work with a senior faculty member as a discussion leader in four sections.”
During the time of their contract, which lasts two years, students will still be able to apply for jobs and finish their dissertations.
“There is 25 percent less workload than non-tenure track professors,” Lamy said. “So they still have time to work on their dissertation and still have contact with their advisers.”
Alexander Young, who recently finished his Ph.D. in English, is one of the post-doctorates in the pilot year of this program. A total of six out of 20 applicants were accepted, three in the social sciences department and three in the humanities department.
Young believes that this program will improve his job application process, which is often difficult for recent Ph.D. graduates.
“The academic job market is tightening, and it is increasingly difficult to get a tenure track position out of grad school,” Young said. “The hope is that we will be going on the job market with better resumes than we would have had had we not had this teaching position.”
Administrators believe both Ph.D. students and undergraduates will benefit from this program.
“You get someone teaching your class who is brand new, closer to your age, excited about it and have a lot of energy,” Lamy said. “And they want to do really well, so they will be more likely to focus on the course.”
Ph.D. Elizabeth Ann Logan, who is teaching American Legal History, said she appreciates the opportunities the program provides.
“I’m grateful for the opportunity to lecture and mentor USC students in the area of legal history in the context of the law history and culture major,” Logan said. “I’m getting a chance to blend history and law in a way I haven’t before — an opportunity that this program is affording me.”
“Representing the Global War on Terror” is one of the required freshman general education seminars taught by Young.
“[The preceptor program] has created some new course offerings and put some younger instructors in the classroom,” Young said. “I have the opportunity to work with students on a new project that is evolving as it is unfolding in the classroom.”
Young is grateful for being a preceptor at USC, considering the struggle for most post-doctorates.
“The crisis in academic hiring has made it tough for recent Ph.D.’s,” Young said. “Now, Ph.D.’s can stay at USC and earn reasonable salary and benefits and job stability.”
Young’s situation is different than most Ph.D. students, who, after graduating, must teach at multiple institutions to make a livable wage.
“They are freeway flyers,” Lamy said. “Often, they must teach at four institutions to make a living.”
The aim of the program is to prevent the need of that lifestyle and allow young doctorates to develop their skills.
“We want them to be much more competitive in the job market,” Lamy said. “That’s our goal.”
While many other universities have opened up these types of postdoctorate programs to everyone, USC’s preceptor program is reserved for USC students.
“That’s what makes it different,” said Lamy. “We are trying to find ways to expand our relationship with the liberal arts.”
From an outside perspective, this program gives Ph.D. students more opportunities than usual.
“This kind of program at USC can give the young scholar an opportunity to get broader teaching experience, especially if they receive mentorship and professional development opportunities,” said Russell A. Berman, professor of German studies and comparative literature at Stanford University, to Inside Higher Education.
USC’s program takes its roots from one introduced by Woodrow Wilson at Princeton. Other universities have implemented similar programs since then, and USC has recently caught on.
“But we’re are in the middle of the parade — not behind or ahead,” said Lamy.
As this is the first year, Lamy expects even more growth and development.
“We try to meet with the preceptors every semester to get feedback from this first group,” Lamy said. “We are hoping that if it works well we will see the program grow.”
Lamy said he has high hopes for the preceptors.
“Hopefully today’s preceptors are tomorrow’s full-time professors at a major universities.”

Student Affairs has received more reports of bias incidents from students this semester than it did for all of the previous academic year.
All reports go directly to the office of Lynette Merriman, assistant vice provost for Student Affairs,  student support and advocacy. She said she has seen a high amount of submissions and predicts more to follow.
“I expect the numbers to continue to increase as students are talking about it and are made more aware of how easy it is to report,” Merriman said.
Merriman attributes this change to a combination of factors, including a Facebook post by Undergraduate Student Government President Rini Sampath and USC’s letter to the community. Both of these, she believes, help to educate students on the important subject of bias.
“I think sparking conversation about bias will provide an opportunity for students to realize that it is okay to speak up if someone says something offensive,” Merriman said. “I think that if our community has the confidence to speak up whenever we feel uncomfortable or when something inappropriate is said. If that becomes the practice, it will definitely help to decrease incidents.”
Sampath went public and reported an incident of racism she experienced outside a fraternity house on the evening of Sept. 19.
That Saturday night, a student verbally assaulted Sampath and her friends from the inside of a fraternity house and proceeded to throw a drink out the window.
Sampath said the events of that night are not uncommon.
“What happened on our campus on Saturday is not an isolated incident: It is happening on campuses across the nation and it is the result of a climate of intolerance that accepts hateful speech and actions,” Sampath wrote in a Facebook post on Sept. 22.
In the past few weeks at USC, there has been an outpouring of student reports of incidents like Sampath’s.
Juliet Porter, an undeclared sophomore, said she’s noticed a recent change in environment on campus.
“Lately, I have been hearing more and more about incidents like Rini’s,” Porter said. “It makes me sad to think that the remarkable diversity of our campus is not being celebrated as it should be.”
Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that there was an increase in reports of bias incidents and hate crimes. There was only an increase in reports of bias incidents. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
There may be more reports, but how many of them the Office will find legitimate…..
Time will tell…

The men’s water polo team is looking to avenge its only loss of the season when the Trojans face off against Stanford Saturday morning.
USC has won 10 of 11 games this season, with its only loss coming to Stanford on Sept. 20 at the Kap7 NorCal Invitational.
The Trojans will have a chance to get revenge as No. 3-ranked USC takes on No. 2 Stanford at home on Saturday at 10:30 a.m., kicking off a busy weekend of water polo at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
On Sunday, the Trojans will play San Jose State in an afternoon affair.
Since losing their first game of the season to the Cardinal, the Trojans have gained a new perspective of what they can do better in the pool.
“In the Stanford game we were particularly hesitant at times and that reflected in our offense,” junior Blake Edwards said. “We are creating opportunities and that’s a reflection of the talent of our team and our systems so if we just change the mindset there’s no team that can beat us.”
USC started out strong in MPSF play with a 17-9 victory over seventh-ranked Long Beach State last Saturday behind a hat trick each from Nick Bell, Grant Stein and Chase Koplow.
“Last game [against Stanford] was pretty disappointing for us,” sophomore Lachlan Edwards said. “I think that Long Beach game and getting some goals on the board gave some of the guys a bit of confidence.”
The Trojans, led by head coach Jovan Vavic, have dominated teams thus far this season in non-conference play, outscoring opponents 222-58 and allowing just 5.4 goals per game, good enough to rank first in the MPSF in offense at 20.2 goals per game and third in defense.
For the first time in quite a while, the Trojans don’t have their score sheet filled by primarily just one player, as it did in previous years with all-time scording leaders Nikola Vavic and Kostas Genidounias.
They are led on offense by Edwards, who transferred from Deakin University in Australia and has an impressive 31 goals through 11 games. Edwards, a member of the Australian National Team, served as team captain at the 2013 and 2015 World University Games. Matteo Morelli (21 goals), Mac Carden (18 goals) and Nick Bell (17 goals) round out the top goal scorers for USC.
It will be a marquee match-up on Saturday with two of the top three teams in the nation squaring off.
The all-time record is relatively even, with USC dipping below .500 against Stanford since 1979 at 59-60 after its loss to the Cardinal on Sept. 20. Stanford, led by Bret Bonanni with 43 goals, is 12-1 on the season. However, under Vavic, the Trojans are a sturdy 48-17 against the Cardinal.
After that 6-5 loss to the Cardinal in the 2015 Kap7 NorCal Invitational semifinals a couple weeks ago, Bell believes that USC now has a chip on their shoulders to get a win against Stanford.
Unlike with Stanford, the Trojans have little history against San Jose State because the Spartans’ water polo team is in its first year of existence since 1981, when the program was discontinued.
The Spartans have struggled in their first year back, with a 3-8 record thus far under head coach Bruce Watson.
After this weekend’s slate of games at home, USC will participate in the SoCal Tournament hosted by LMU and Pepperdine on Oct. 10-11.
“I think we can beat any team — it’s just about whether we play our systems and everyone does their role,” Edwards said. “If that happens I think we can beat anyone. I think it will be a much different story this time.”

The No. 2 Women of Troy (14-0, 2-0 Pac-12) will host Washington State (12-2, 1-1 Pac-12) and No. 5 Washington (12-0, 2-0) this weekend.
After four straight matches away, the Women of Troy are looking forward to playing at home. Head coach Mick Haley prefers playing at the Galen Center because it is comfortable for the team.
“We love the fan support,” Haley said. “The way the students come out and root for us.”
This week, senior outside hitter Samantha Bricio picked up her fourth Pac-12 Player of the Week award.
She’s the first player in the conference to have received four of these honors in a five week span, and now holds the most of these type of honors in USC history.
In addition to her fourth Pac-12 award this week, Bricio was named the espnW National Player of the Week.
Haley is excited for Bricio and feels that she is deserving of the awards because of the way that she’s been carrying the team.
“She has a good chance to be the player of the year this year,” Haley said. “If she continues to improve and lead the team like she has been.”
The Women of Troy will face the Cougars on Friday night. The Cougars opened up their season with an 11-match winning streak that the Huskies snapped to open up conference play.
For the Washington State offense, junior outside hitter Kyra Holt ranks fourth in the Pac-12 with 4.35 kills per set. The Women of Troy will need to limit her offensive production to maintain control in the match.
Washington State’s freshman middle blocker Claire Martin is seventh in the conference with 1.33 blocks per set.
USC will have to run their fast offense through multiple channels and remain strong at the net to overcome Martin’s presence.
While the main focus this weekend would seem to be placed on Sunday’s match against the undefeated Huskies, Haley is not looking over the Cougars.
He expects Washington State to come in and play comfortably at the Galen Center.
“They’re our only opponent until after that match is over,” Haley said.
USC holds the upper hand in both rivalries, but the Huskies have won the last three against the Women of Troy.
On Sunday, the Women of Troy will look to break that streak. Pac-12 Networks volleyball analyst Josh Grau, former coach at Texas and Northwestern,  emphasized that USC is the hot team to beat right now coming off of a tough preseason schedule and two wins to open up Pac-12 play. He also pointed out that Washington is a team that hasn’t been tested as much, as they had an easier preseason schedule.
“Washington on the road puts them at a disadvantage,” Grau said.
For USC to top the Huskies, the Women of Troy will need a strong game from Bricio, both at the net and from the service line.
In addition to Bricio, the Women of Troy will need the rest of the offense, like freshman outside hitter Alyse Ford, senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, sophomore opposite Brittany Abercrombie and freshman setter Baylee Johnson, to attack quickly, get good looks and break down Washington’s defense.
“It’s just a matter of trusting these players,” Grau said. “And giving them more looks.”
Washington has a strong offense as well in sophomore outside hitter Courtney Schwan (fifth in hitting percentage in conference) and senior middle blocker Lianna Sybeldon (first in hitting percentage in conference).
To stop Schwan and Sybeldon, Grau pointed out that USC will need to remain strong at the net.
“If they stay disciplined, they’ll be able to contain,” Grau said.
Grau emphasized that for either team to win, it will come down to their serving.
If USC can serve aggressively and keep Washington from making a solid first contact on the ball, the Women of Troy has a good shot at winning the match.
USC will face Washington State Friday at 7 p.m. and Washington on Sunday at 1 p.m at the Galen Center.

In volleyball, the sequence of bump, set and spike seems like an easy concept to grasp, though it’s actually a lot harder than it sounds to practice in live play — especially when the ball is traveling at high speeds.
The No. 2-ranked USC women’s volleyball team, though, has made it look as if it were that simple on the court so far this season.
I don’t want to jinx anything because the Pac-12 is arguably one of the toughest conferences to play in throughout all of collegiate women’s volleyball, but this team is fostering a championship pedigree early on under 15th-year head coach Mick Haley.
The program is off to its best start in a decade after catapulting to an unblemished 14-0 record to begin its 2015 campaign. It’s the fifth time that Haley, who has won two national titles at the helm, has led one of his teams to a 13-0 or better start.
In 2006, the team opened up the season with a 17-0 mark that the Women of Troy will try to match or surpass in the coming matches with the heart of Pac-12 play on the horizon.
The Women of Troy are not only winning games, but are also doing so in style.
USC, who is one of only five undefeated teams left in the country, has dropped just four sets during its 14-match winning streak. The only time it was pushed to go the distance was in its most recent win on the road over Stanford — a match in which it was forced to come back from a set down to win in five sets.
The team’s exceptional start also includes a sweep of crosstown rival UCLA at Pauley Pavilion and a 30-set winning streak.
Evidently, the Women of Troy have shown that they’re a force to be reckoned with not only in the Pac-12, but around the country — it’s in their blood.
USC has been a women’s volleyball powerhouse for quite a long time, and a lot of credit for that has to go to Haley, who took over in 2001.
Though the program hasn’t won a national championship since 2003, they have finished in the top third of the Pac-12 almost every year Haley has been in charge.
Most fans remember the golden days of USC football under Pete Carroll in the early 2000s when he led the Trojans to a remarkable 34-game winning streak from 2003 to 2005.
Around the same time, Haley strung together a 54-game winning streak that lasted from 2002 to 2004, including an unrivaled 35-0 perfect season in 2003. During that streak, USC lost only 14 of 170 sets.
This year’s Women of Troy team is about a quarter of the way there, and it possesses the talent to accomplish similar feats if it can continue to execute in Haley’s newly revamped system.
Its success starts with the country’s leading scorer — a 6-foot-2 outside hitter from Mexico named Samantha Bricio who is one of the most dynamic players in all of the women’s college game. After posting 228 kills through 14 games, the decorated two-time All-American and team captain has already been a recipient of Pac-12 Player of the Week honors four times this season and was also recently named the espnW National Player of the Week.
The USC offense undoubtedly starts with Bricio, but the Women of Troy have been especially effective because they also have a number of other weapons in the attacking game, including two other 100-plus kill players in freshman Alyse Ford and sophomore Brittany Abercrombie.
Both have provided a spark of young talent on the offensive side of the ball for the Women of Troy.
The defense has been carried by the reigning Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Week in senior middle blocker Alicia Ogoms, who’s second in the country in blocks with 1.72 blocks per set.She’s also third in the Pac-12 in hitting percentage.
An array of young talent mixed with veteran play has put Haley’s team in the driver’s seat to win a conference title. It would be its first since 2011.
The program has reached the NCAA regional finals and a pair of NCAA semifinal matches in recent years, but its first goal has to be winning the Pac-12 championship before anything else.
With a tough schedule ahead, this team will surely be tested like it was at Stanford.
It starts again this weekend with them hosting its fellow undefeated team, the No. 5-ranked Washington Huskies.
Another Pac-12 foe that remains undefeated is Arizona State, and that should prove to be a tough match as well.
This year’s Women of Troy have a blueprint for success and have played exceptionally well thus far, but they’re going to need to continue to play at this high level if they’re going to come out with wins in these challenging matches.
The women’s beach volleyball team deservingly stole the spotlight last spring after it went 28-0 on its way to winning a national championship.
While bragging rights rest in the sand for the time being, the Women of Troy have a golden opportunity to take them back for the indoor game at USC.
Being just two wins away from matching last season’s win total, USC just has to keep digging as it moves forward with Pac-12 play.

Thanks for the info on the tourney, thats great news. The team i playing very well this season, and are having fun. I think some cancer from last seasons team left and things are humming. Do you know who any of the signings are for next year?
This team has something going for them besides talent. The new system fits them well, and defensively playing extra special.
Chemistry is there which was missing last season with better players. The old adage of finishing strong is what really counts.
The first two rounds of ncaa tourney will be at Galen Ctr. which is a gift, then going to San Diego for sweet sixteen. The regular
season is only to get a higher seed, and stay closer to home for the playoffs.

Don’t Worry Baby, an indie film written and directed by Julian Branciforte, adds lightness to the dark and tumultuous side of love and parenthood. The film takes an overused storyline and makes it its own by adding an unconventional flair. It takes a dark and uncomfortable topic — a father and son who compete over the paternity of a child after unintentionally sleeping with the same woman — and turns it into a narrative that is both composed and non-judgmental. Those who are used to predictable romantic comedies might be surprised to find that the movie plays out in an entirely different way.
The movie starts with Robert Lang (John Magaro), a young artist and photographer who is struggling to make ends meet. He meets with his father, Harry Lang (Christopher McDonald), who tells his son that he has had an affair with a younger woman once again. Harry criticizes him for not being able to support himself and offers him a job as a kindergarten teacher at the school he runs. The young man sheepishly accepts this position, forcing him to run into an old flame, Sara-Beth (Dreama Walker), at work. He later finds out that Sara-Beth is pregnant and is the young woman that his father cheated on his mother with, leaving him angered and conflicted. With the possibility that either man could be the father, the two men begrudgingly agree to take on the responsibilities of taking care of the child until the test results come in, forcing them to spend time with each other. Their constant competition for the fatherhood and affection of the young woman make for a strangely interesting dynamic in the story.
The film’s cinematography is gloomily picturesque in a way that reflects the somber tone of the story without being too dark or intense. The movie takes place in New York, but Branciforte chooses to capture more obscure and unique places like restaurants in Chinatown and old apartment rooms, abandoning the traditional Hollywood version of a film in New York. While it is obvious that it is a low-budget indie film, it makes up for the lack of multiplicity in scenes with authenticity.
Though many movies shame women who sleep with multiple men, all the characters in Don’t Worry Baby are respectful to Sara-Beth, never degrading her for her relationship with the two men. Even Miriam Lang (Talia Balsam), Robert’s wife, does not express any dislike for
Sara-Beth and acts friendly toward her. There’s a scene in which the mother embraces Sara-Beth’s child, who could potentially also be her husband’s, making the viewer feel unsure whether or not to feel pleased or disturbed. The two women then go out to eat Chinese food together where one of them says, “He took me there on our first date,” and the other replies, “Me too!” This scene and many others unquestionably break societal norms, moving away from
slut-shaming and toward a more accepting environment.
Robert’s friend Lenny, played by Tom Lipinski, serves as comic relief, but fails to deliver. Though he could’ve added a refreshing perspective as the only character in the movie uninvolved in the drama of the dysfunctional family, he doesn’t. Instead, he takes up screen time with silly, useless lines about sex and porn that do not add to the film. The audience is left wondering if the movie would have been better had his character not been in it at all.
The pinnacle of the film — the disclosure of the baby’s father — is anticlimactic. Despite all the anxiety, build-up and anticipation, the characters respond in an accepting and tolerant way. The absence of raw emotion, emotion that would have been normal in any situation similar to this, makes the ending awkward. If it were so apparent that both were competing to be the father, then the fact that no one was shocked or angry at the result made it disappointing for viewers.
The movie closes with the dysfunctional family happily smiling and conversing around the dinner table. The song “Seabird” by the Alessi Brothers, a rock band from the late ’70s and early ’80s that resembles Arcade Fire, ends the movie with a folksy, mystical and upbeat feeling.
Don’t Worry Baby is a film that could be viewed as entirely ridiculous or absolutely brilliant depending on one’s outlook. Some might think the movie is trying too hard to be unconventional while others might feel that it’s a beautiful and authentic story, but one thing is clear: Branciforte’s directorial debut results in a dramatic film that is startlingly grounded in execution.

When I heard about Amy Schumer’s newly negotiated $10 million book deal last month, it got me thinking about one of my favorite books from last year. First, it was an autobiography and I, on the whole, am a fiction girl through and through. Second, it was written by someone who wasn’t famous as an author, but famous as an actress. The book was Judy Greer’s memoir, I Don’t Know What You Know Me From: Confessions of a Co-Star. The title of the book instantly struck me as funny because I knew exactly what Greer was talking about. I grew up watching her face in romantic comedies — not as the star but always as the best friend, the frenemy or the sassy work colleague. I was drawn in by Greer’s frankness; she was someone being upfront about who she was and how she was viewed by the public, all the while being refreshingly disarming.
This was, in all honesty, something that I desperately needed. After moving from London to Los Angeles for college last year, I felt that I had spent my freshman year fully immersing myself in L.A. culture. I loved this, and I love L.A. — for its beautiful landscapes, its variety of cultures and its amazing food. The only thing I struggled with was the bizarre celebrity culture. Coming to a place where actors and musicians are hailed as heroes and idols was disorienting. I sometimes felt as though nothing around me was real: the perfectly groomed people, the designer labels, the absurd amount of importance placed on money, brands and social status. England has a very different class system than America. Our class system is older and, in many ways, much more backward. Still, in England, celebrities are “new money.” They are not at the top of the social scale, though this has been changing slightly in recent years as the influence of American culture has trickled over. In the end, celebrity culture confused and, at times, disgusted me. That was why I was so pleased to read Judy Greer’s book and why I am so supportive of the recent trend in humorous celebrity memoirs, especially those written by powerful and inspirational women.
So, needless to say, I loved the book. It was an easy read, and I chuckled to myself constantly. What I liked most about it was Greer’s honesty. She is candid about how awkward interactions can be with fans who recognize her but aren’t sure where from, about being starstruck at award shows and about how hard it has been to come to terms with the fact that she may never be the leading lady. In a society where celebrities are our royalty and where every story we hear has to be one of undeniable success, reading something that sounded like it actually came from a real person was wonderfully refreshing. To hear that the people we idolize and envy have embarrassing moments, awkward encounters and a great deal of self doubt makes a culture that is so untouchable seem a little bit more real.
Another book like Greer’s is Mindy Kaling’s autobiography Is Everyone Hanging Out With Me? In her best-selling autobiography, Kaling discusses growing up with immigrant parents, her opinions on romance, her body image and her struggle to come to terms with not being the stereotypical skinny Hollywood poster girl. Her book is both comical and inspiring. Yet again, here is a celebrity who is being open with her readers and showing them that idolized individuals have their own problems and their own struggles. Her latest book, Why Not Me?, is a continuation of her insightful observations. Similarly, Tina Fey’s memoir Bossypants is ballsy in its discussion of feminism and gender in Hollywood, and Fey doesn’t try to gild or embellish her story. She starts her book by retelling her late-bloomer upbringing. Fey then details her experiences and conflicts faced as the first female head writer on Saturday Night Live and, later, a showrunner on 30 Rock.
Of course, I know I might be being a bit naïve here. Celebrities are always going to try to seem relatable in their autobiographies. Nobody wants to read a book with an arrogant narrator, bragging about how their life is better than yours. Still, I think there is something new and exciting happening here. These books I love are from the perspective of women who acknowledge that they are imperfect and that perhaps they haven’t conquered the world. They are stories of success but also of failure, of acceptance rather than always winning. In a culture where we are constantly being judged and judging each other, these women are here to break down the attitudes of competition, and encourage ones of tolerance and solidarity. Behind the massive paychecks and the red carpets, I think these memoirs have something to tell us about how we view each other and how we should be treating each other. And if I’m reading too far into this, at least they’ll make you laugh.

A wave of discontent within the Los Angeles Unified School District has brought local policymakers together to augment existing infrastructure by increasing the number of the city’s charter schools. Just this month, LAUSD and other California school districts experienced a common sentiment of worry when their students’ low Common Core test results were released. Inevitably, plans to aid the district’s rates of high dropout, low test scores and low proficiency ratings has called for new programs. This strong and unified stride to advance the K-12 educational system in Los Angeles will reap long-term benefits in the end.
Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced his support for a plan in conjunction with fundraising to double the number of L.A. charter schools over the course of the next eight years, according to the Los Angeles Times. The combination of the foundation’s internal fundraising alongside other donors is expected to generate $490 million to open 260 charter schools in the school district.
Though it seems this new plan for charter schools would appease worried parents and Angelenos, the proposal has received a mixture of both support and disdain. For proponents of the plan, including Villaraigosa, the increase of charter schools will not completely solve the education crisis in L.A., but rather, temporarily ease it. Last week, Villaraigosa spoke at the Sol Price School of Public Policy on issues facing the current educational system where he expressed this notion.
“I don’t think just expanding charter is the path,” Villaraigosa said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. “I said while I was mayor that I didn’t care if it was a charter school or a traditional public school or a hybrid … I want to see more success and higher standards and accountability.”
Though opponents might argue that charter schools leave behind students who are “incompetent” and difficult to work with, they should also note the level of improvement K-12 charter students have undergone. If one were to compare test results between charter school students and LAUSD students, the former would most definitely outdo the latter. But if one were to compare charter and magnet schools, the latter’s students would outperform the charter school students. Thus, one cannot simply use data and analytics to reach a substantial conclusion of which form of schooling is best for students in L.A.
Though statistics are a good way of measuring student progress, opponents of the traditional public school system argue that greater options are always better. Often, the debate regarding whether the public, private or charter school is best for students is lost in numbers.
The difference among all three comes down to preference. A traditional public school offers funding backed by federal revenue while the charter schools in Los Angeles can be independent or district-affiliated and are exempt from state regulations. In 1992, the Charter School Act created a performance-based environment with the intent of specifically aiding students who are academically low-achieving. Charter schools are open to any interested public school student and are shut down when deemed as inefficiently increasing student performance ratings.
I support charter schools because they are founded upon the freedom of choice. In an era in which Common Core standards are taking over traditional curriculums — one which constantly adapts to meet the needs of students and their performance — charter schools are certainly the stronger alternative.
By creating more charter schools, proponents have been faced with opposition for allocating funding away from public schools. But charter schools are creating the prospects for low-income students to attend charter schools with specialized curricula geared towards their needs. If opponents of the plan are truly concerned with the waste of funding backed by a failed curriculum, they should look at the existing Common Core system backed by state funding. Don’t attack a system that promotes greater options for parents.
Parents deserve to determine where their children will best fit. Whether that be in a public, charter, private or magnet school, it’s their choice to assess which school will best accommodate their children. The future of LAUSD should not be limited if so much more can be done to augment its existing infrastructure.

Any achievement comparison needs to be done “apple-to-apples”. Comparing district magnet schools to charters does not work because the district includes its GATE (Gifted and Talented) programs in there. One needs to properly account for demographics to make achievement comparisons. One way of doing that is using the “similar students measure” – and that seems to validate charters’ edge in academic achievement in Los Angeles.
Standard, government, district schools have what check on their performance? 40% high school drop out rate for LAUSD. How are they held accountable?
The key lies in the name. Charter schools get a charter from what public body? 
Charter schools get their money from the State of California based on attendance and performance.
Charters get a charter from either their local school board, their county board, or the state board of education.
Charter schools are public schools. Allocating money to them, is like payi g any other vendor that works for the district. People like the food providers; kids in the district get fed whether district employees heat the food or whether it arrives hot from another company. Likewise kids can be taught by district, teacher union teachers, or non union, employees of an education company.

Sitting outside the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, we randomly selected five students in the Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and asked them if they could name their dean. Only one could.
Dornsife students don’t know their dean, but — because this figure plays such a pivotal role in the direction of the College — they should.
In Fall 2016, incoming freshmen in Dornsife will likely be welcomed by a new dean at convocation. This new dean will serve as the leader of the University’s largest school, tasked with overseeing every facet of Dornsife — from student and faculty recruitment to budget management and fundraising.
The dean’s role isn’t a major part of the day-to-day student experience right now, but this needs to change — starting with the selection of the new dean. As the University begins its search, a student voice will be integral in ensuring the next dean meets the needs of the entire campus community. The University should choose a dean who will remain accountable to students and embody the principles of the University.
University administration will most likely be primarily concerned with the role of Dornsife’s new dean in the University’s $6 billion fundraising campaign. And while we need a dean who is willing to recognize the importance of this campaign as well as someone who has the skills necessary to meet the University’s fundraising goals, we also want the new dean to remain transparent and accessible to students.
Dornsife offers 79 majors and 69 minors in several diverse disciplines, including the natural sciences, humanities and social sciences. The intellectual diversity, coupled with the sheer number of Dornsife students — more than 10,000 to be precise — present several challenges that the new dean must address. The new dean should, for example, work to improve academic advising and the quality of career and academic services.
Additionally, the dean should remain faithful to the core values of the University — including diversity. The new dean should look to improve diversity on an institutional level and, as the highest administrative figure involved in hiring decisions, work to ensure the hiring of women and faculty of color. And in light of recent campus discussions, the dean should make clear to students that diversity is a priority.
Over the past decade, the deans of the College of Letters, Arts and Sciences have been plagued with high turnover. Current Dornsife Dean Steve Kay joined the college just three years ago, his predecessor Howard Gillman stayed for five years and Gillman’s predecessor, Peter Starr, served as interim dean for one year. It does both the college and its students a great disservice to have a trend of ever-changing leadership.
But this doesn’t have to be the norm. At other colleges in the University, the dean has occupied a larger presence. For example, in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, Dean Ernest J. Wilson III has consistently led the school through a number of large-scale changes, many of which may not have been possible without his longstanding leadership. Choosing a dean who is willing to remain with the University in the long term is the only way Dornsife students will see continuous progress.
Once the new dean is chosen, the onus is on the University to keep the dean involved with students and to ensure student input is helping to drive the vision of the College. As the University begins its search for Dornsife’s next leader, it must look for someone who will be more to students than just the signature at the bottom of a campus-wide memo.

Organization and being clutter-free is key. Palak Patel | Daily Trojan
Two weeks ago, I decided that I had had enough. Clothes I never wore, shoes that barely fit, books I didn’t even like and stacks of old assignments, seemed to be sucking me in like an all-consuming vortex. 
Stuff. I just had too much of it. 
I started with my closet. I decided that I was going to donate everything I hadn’t worn in the past three months. Part of me kept saying, “Not that one, it was expensive!” or “You’re going to need a hideous neon-blue pencil skirt someday!” Instead of listening, I grit my teeth and kept pulling things out of my wardrobe. After that, it was on to my jewelry and makeup. Old lipsticks, half-used mascaras and eyeliners in colors I was never going to wear were tossed out. I placed all the things I’d decided to get rid of in opaque black bags so I wouldn’t have a chance to second guess my decision to get rid of them. 
Looking around at my progress, I decided that I might as well finish what I had started. And so, rather warily if I’m being honest, I opened up the gaping black hole I call my backpack. I slowly filed away old assignments, pulled out old receipts and threw away stray gum wrappers and instructions to labs I had already completed. I even booted up my laptop and organized all of my documents into folders, getting rid of hundreds of old assignments. 
Finally, almost seven hours later, I was done. Three massive black bags stood in front of me, and I drove them out to the local Goodwill before I lost my nerve. As they were carried away, I felt a drop in the pit of my stomach. But it was too late, and I couldn’t take back my decision now. Instead, I just treated myself to some frozen yogurt before driving back home. 
Upon arriving home again, I looked around my room. Part of me assumed that I’d notice the things that were no longer there, but instead I found myself noticing all the things that still surrounded me. My favorite Essie nail polish, a Christmas mug from my grandma and a framed Polaroid of my best friend sat on the counter opposite me. It took me a second to realize that I was grinning wider than the Cheshire Cat.
Before, the sheer amount of stuff I had kept me from appreciating anything I owned. The belongings were weighing me down, and keeping me from taking notice of the things that really mattered. I’ve learned the importance of taking a moment to look around and evaluate whether the things that surround me are somehow contributing to my life. I encourage you to do the same, and take a day to simply cleanse. It can feel like you’re shedding an old skin, and the result is both refreshing and uplifting.

Well, folks, clear your calendar this Saturday, stock your fridge and get ready for a good week of football. The Trojans aren’t playing this week, you say? Well, I think our team deserves a good break after stomping all over Sparky. And trust me, even though the boys in cardinal and gold aren’t playing this weekend, there’s still plenty of good football to watch. Sure, most people will be focusing on Notre Dame-Clemson and Alabama-Georgia. But don’t let those high-profile games distract you from a deep lineup of exciting games to watch. As the Oregon-Utah game showed us, there is no such thing as a predictable weekend in college football and things are going to get even more unpredictable in the best way possible.
For those of you who have been keeping track, as of last week we were at 78 percent accuracy overall. Due to several last-minute tips and botched punt attempts, we were 72 percent accurate last week (Our condolences go out to the state of Texas — y’all had a rough weekend of football). So our C+ days are over but you win some and lose some as Arkansas State knows well (They’re finally not in the Coaches Poll anymore!!).
A final comment before we get to this week’s games. The sharp-eyed college football fan will notice there are some odd predictions for this week such as Indiana over Ohio State or Idaho over Arkansas State. We realized that these odd predictions are due, in large part, to the structure of our model. Rather than mess with the numbers to protect our ego and our oh-so-precious accuracy, we are keeping those potentially erroneous predictions just in case someone is foolish to use these predictions as a basis for placing sports bets. Got to throw off the competition, you know? All jokes aside, we chose to keep these predictions in because they are the product of the model we created for this season and while it far from a perfect model, we wanted to see how this general model would fare throughout the season. Enough talk — it’s time for predictions!
West Virginia at Oklahoma (Spread: 13.5)
Come Saturday this game will have been beaten to death by all major sports media outlets, but don’t let that keep you from checking out this game. West Virginia racked up 601 total yards last week against Maryland (a large reason why they’re favored in our model despite Vegas thinking otherwise). The final score, 45-6, and West Virginia’s fake punt while up 38-0 shows that they still haven’t forgotten their 37-0 loss to Maryland in 2013.
Oklahoma, on the other hand, had a bye last week, so not much has changed since their 52-38 victory over Tulsa in Week 3. Something of note though is quarterback Baker Mayfield’s offensive production against Tulsa where he threw for 487 yards and scored four touchdowns. On the season he has thrown more than 1000 yards and gotten to the end zone 10 times.
Our model is favoring West Virginia because of their blowout wins but they’re going to have a much more difficult time against Oklahoma’s productive offense.
No. 3 Ole Miss at No. 25 Florida (Spread: 4)
I think it is safe to say that at the beginning of the season, few people believed both of these teams would be going into Week 5 undefeated. Ole Miss is now a team being discussed as a contender for the College Football Playoffs. Florida’s comeback victory over Tennessee last weekend showed they’re not a team to take lightly. They snatched that victory from Tennessee’s grasp with a 63-yard touchdown with less than two minutes to play on fourth down. It doesn’t get much colder than that. But that, my friends, is college football.
Now Florida’s prize following the win is playing one of the hottest programs. OK, they didn’t look too hot against Vanderbilt last weekend but we’ll cut them some slack after beating Alabama the week before that. Facing off against already offensively challenged team, Ole Miss’s defense is going to make this a tough game for Florida. But if the Gators’ defense can keep them in the game then maybe —just maybe — Florida can keep their undefeated dream alive.
No. 5 Baylor at Texas Tech (Spread: 11)
Last week I begged Texas Tech’s defense to think of the poor college students who love to toss their friends in the air after a touchdown. Clearly they didn’t hear my plea because they had yet another shootout against Texas Christian and almost upset them except for one tipped ball in the end zone.
Despite the heartbreaking loss, Texas Tech showed that they are better than everyone gave them credit. While defense is a big concern for Texas Tech, an even bigger concern is the health of quarterback Pat Mahomes. If you don’t know or didn’t see, Pat Mahomes injured his left knee in the first quarter of their loss to TCU last weekend. He wore a brace for the rest of the game and his mobility was limited. That didn’t seem to affect his throwing arm, though; he went on to throw for 392 yards and 2 touchdowns while giving up no picks. To beat Baylor, Texas Tech needs its quarterback. It’s as simple as that.
Against Rice, Baylor quarterback Seth Russell completed just 12 passes but six of those passes went for touchdowns and he still threw for 277 yards on 16 attempts. There’s really not much more to say about Baylor except that their offense is firing on all cylinders right now.
Both teams are going to score a lot but ultimately our model says Baylor will come out on top. Get your popcorn ready for this one — it’s gonna be a true shootout.
No. 13 Alabama at No. 8 Georgia (Spread: 1)
An Alabama team that Vegas thinks is an underdog? What a time to be alive. That’s not to say Alabama is suddenly a bad team, but questions — particularly at quarterback — still exist.
Georgia started the season with similar questions about their offense but promising performances from graduate transfer Greyson Lambert has helped put some of those questions to rest. While Georgia hasn’t had the toughest schedule of late, Lambert is 33 for 35 passing completions is nothing to sneeze at.
As a rivalry game, this game always means quite a bit for both teams, and this year is no exception. All we can do now is see what underdog Alabama has up its sleeve.

These days, country is a controversial music genre. The fans that have been listening to country since Johnny Cash first picked up a guitar would argue that the genre has been turned into something formulaic and commoditized. They would argue that the genre has lost touch with its roots, and it’s nothing more than watered-down pop music with a Southern attitude to appeal to the masses, and that you’d have to do some serious researching to find an act that plays with that old, country soul.
They’re not completely wrong — but that’s not to say that the genre should be looked down upon. In fact, country songs are very prevalent in the world of mainstream music today. Don’t forget, before charting No. 1 hits as a pop icon, Taylor Swift got her name in headlines as a country star. But not all country stars have to become pop artists to have hits of their own. Uncle Kracker, Lady Antebellum and Luke Bryan have all topped the charts while still remaining as country artists.
I think more and more people are starting to like country, which is a good thing. People used to hate it because it was just what everyone did, but that’s not the case anymore — it’s no longer seen as just “hillbilly music.” Not everyone is in love with the genre itself, but anyone can find at least one song that they like from its many sub-genres. I have yet to meet someone who doesn’t sing along to “Sweet Home Alabama” with a big grin on their face.
For me, country is a number of things. The slower songs help me unwind and relax after a long day, or they keep me entertained during a long and sunny drive. The more upbeat songs are a great way to get a party started, and they’re instrumental to a good day at the beach. I also enjoy the older, foot-stomping and fiddle-heavy songs of the older country days. Bluegrass and country folk hold a dear place in my heart as a result of my mom playing the soundtrack to O Brother, Where Art Thou? every time we road-tripped to Kentucky.
My favorite thing about country is its ability to raise anyone’s spirits. Whenever I’m feeling down, I can always count on country to cheer me up. A little country goes a long way.

My next stop on my road trip of donuts in L.A. was Colorado (Donuts), and like any good foodie, I decided to do a little Yelp research beforehand to prepare for the experience. To be quite honest, Colorado Donuts, much like the actual state of Colorado, is not the best of the west. I don’t mean to bash on Colorado, so much as to point out that there are better options if you look around a little, and these donuts were just not that great.
The location is a little out of the way for most college students without a car, but if you do drive there, I would recommend parking in the Trader Joe’s parking lot right behind the building and maybe even doing a little Trader Joe’s run while you’re there, because I mean, why not? As for the actual store, it doesn’t have much seating, but it is typically not too crowded so you should be able to find an open booth and enjoy your donuts sitting down, unlike a lot of other donut shops in L.A.
The first donut I ordered was the Cookie Monster donut, which I actually knew I would be ordering before I even stepped in the store. If you’ve never heard of Colorado Donuts, I’m 95 percent confident that you’ve at least seen a picture of this one. I’ll admit, it is a cute donut, and they also have an Elmo one that’s very similar but with a donut hole for the nose. As for the actual taste, however, there was nothing special about it. In fact, it was rather bland. Instead of frosting, they cover it with the blue sprinkles, and the cookie had clearly been out for a while so it wasn’t crunchy anymore. I might have overestimated the quality of this donut going in just because I had heard so much about it, but at least I enjoyed taking photos of it!
The blueberry cronut with a chocolate mousse filling was definitely the best part about Colorado Donuts. I’m a sucker for cronuts, but this one was especially delicious because of the filling, and because it had the right amount of glaze. It was so good that it almost made up for my disappointment with the Cookie Monster donut, and I would recommend that the bakers at Colorado Donuts continue to make more of these.
Paulina Ordaz | Daily Trojan
All in all, if you choose to go to Colorado Donuts, I would recommend straying from the aesthetically pleasing donuts, unless of course you’re doing it for Instagram. In that case, go for it — no judgement here!
Colorado Donuts is located at 1578 W. Colorado Blvd. #14, Eagle Rock, CA 90041, open from 4:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.

The tall glass bottle on the counter of the Ronald Tutor Campus Center’s Coffee Bean brings me a kind of happiness that no words can describe. For me, no coffee drink is complete without at least four teaspoons of that gooey “classic syrup” of straight liquid sugar that I have emptied into my cup more times than I care to admit. But I reason to myself that I just like to add an extra kick to my caffeine in the morning — it’s harmless. Right?
Not quite. Ever since the mass production of food took flight after WWII, the United States has been fighting a battle with sugar ever since mass produced food was introduced to the public at the height of industrialism in the 1900s. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the average American today consumes 156 pounds of sugar a year. According to the NIH, as of 2014, 29.1 million Americans or 9.3 percent of the population, suffer from diabetes. And, in response to America’s collective sweet tooth, we have taken to artificial sweeteners in attempt to bring that number down. Virtually every soda brand comes in a “sugar-free” and “diet,” form, trading in sucrose and glucose for aspartame and sucralose.
Yet, in an ironic twist of fate, the artificial sweeteners that we have grown to rely on as a way to lose weight and cut down on our sugar consumption may actually cause obesity and diabetes.
A study published in Nature in October 2014 revealed that “bad” bacteria love artificial sweeteners as much as we do. The bacteria in our digestive tract come in two main species, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and live in a careful balance in our gastrointestinal tracts. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes essentially have the same job – to turn energy from food into a form that our bodies can use. The difference is that Firmicutes do their job well, and with the amount of artificial sweeteners Americans now consume, perhaps too well.
If the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are kept in check, metabolism stays constant. Yet, artificial sweeteners, which seem to only boost Firmicute functioning, disrupt the balance. In vitro experiments on mice revealed that as the population of Firmicutes outnumbered that of Bacteroidetes, blood sugar levels and glucose intolerance skyrocketed. To make matters worse, glucose intolerance, when tissues cannot take in sugar from blood, does not just cause diabetes. Sharp increases in blood sugar have been linked to liver and heart disease.
That study left me in shock ­­— could my sweet tooth kill me? Luckily for those of us who see the world through candy-coated glasses, there are a few natural substitutes that can satisfy our daily sugar fix.
Though it might take a while to get used to the taste, agave nectar and date sugar can add the perfect amount of “sweet” to any cup of coffee. And, for college students on a budget, honey and maple syrup are accessible and affordable and can give any drink an added flavor.
