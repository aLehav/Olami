You’re being watched.
That’s what the film “All Light, Everywhere,” which premiered Jan. 31 at the Sundance Film Festival, wants you to remember. Not only are you being watched, you’re being recorded and someone is sitting at their desk somewhere and putting together their own narrative about the things they are observing about you. 
In this film, which feels and looks like an indie PSA, the analyst is sitting at their desk in Scottsdale, Ariz., home of the Axon Enterprise. This software company, the self-professed “tech suite for public safety,” manufactures and calibrates many instruments used in the carrying out of said “public safety,” including tasers, high-tech police cars, drones, eyeglasses you’ve only seen in spy movies, and last but not least, body cameras. 
Theo Anthony, the director, writer and editor of “All Light, Everywhere,” takes us behind the scenes of the company and the places in which these devices manifest. After a long sequence of staring into Anthony’s optical nerve, the main nerve connecting the eye to the brain despite not receiving any visual information, you’re now expected to interpret what you see on screen.
As we walk through the halls of Axon Enterprise, introduced by choppy scenes where an executive prepares a corporate-approved face without noticing the camera is already rolling, we are privy to the manufacturing process. The workers methodically piece together the individual parts of the tasers and body cameras that are purported to one day make bullets obsolete. 
Before we see the dominoes fall, the movie lines up each tile in a purposeful and assertive line. An unnamed voiceover, who introduces themselves as the interpreter to what you’re seeing, places together the overlapping history of the image and violence. 
From Étienne-Jules Marey’s chronophotographic gun to machine gun cameras, cameras’ watchful presence and influence have changed human behavior and observation in a strikingly similar way to the weapons they are modeled off of. When Auguste Lumière captured one of the earliest films in history, were the kids he was observing in then-French colonial Senegal looking at the camera, or the implication of the man behind it?
We skip to the present, in a Baltimore Police Department training for implementation of the Axon body cameras. In this room the film falters, catching the rolled eyes and questions of purpose from the only two Black women cops in the room and no readable reactions from any of the men. 
It’s obvious that the body cameras are a nuisance, but in a trip around the mall with Anthony guiding the body camera’s “cinematographer,” much more sinister issues arise. The body camera is at the center of a person’s chest, not at the eyeline, so forget about the same point of view. The lens is easily obstructed by raised arms, and you can’t see what its wearer is doing, at all. 
This is where the individual narrative moves to replace what the body camera can’t see. Narration becomes explanation, and the testimony is accepted in court without further pretense because “a camera can’t lie” and can’t “take sides.” This doesn’t prevent the police from creating a false narrative and using these cameras to their advantage.
On a macro level, a view from above is also collecting and analyzing data second by second. Persistent Surveillance Systems (yes, the bad feeling starts immediately) and their covert drone surveillance program of Baltimore is introduced by its founder, Ross McNutt. Without inflection, he shows Anthony how the drones can trace the path of a bus, a car or even a person with Google Earth-like quality. The first instance of the program in 2016 happened without anyone in the “troubled” city, even its leaders, knowing, just the FBI and Secret Service. 
Now, in another scene that feels uncomfortably invasive, McNutt relies on a community member to convince his neighbors of the noble goals of the surveillance program. People object to being filmed by anyone, including Anthony’s crew, and as the conversation escalates between the attendees, McNutt just smiles to himself. 
In front of these cameras, your every being is going through a slew of analysis and comparisons, similar to those that fueled the rise of AI and that of eugenics. In these scenarios, the suspect is already identified, without any notion that there will be a safer outcome for their encounter with law enforcement. Even more than previously conceived, the camera is a weapon of the state.
Different quotes related to seeing and observing divide the chapters of the film, but none fit quite as well as that of French police officer Alphonse Bertillon, the mind behind the application of anthropometry, or measuring of physical characteristics, to identify criminals. 
“The eye only sees in each thing that for which it looks, and it only looks for that of which it already has an idea,” Bertillon wrote. 
“All Light, Everywhere,” is not immune to this conclusion. It takes on the intersection of police violence, surveillance and anti-Black racism rather haphazardly, coaxing a reaction with the camera rather than observing one. 
In all, the film’s warning is undeniably clear, and the impression it leaves will be slow to fade.

“Clearly we were in a boat that needed desperately to be rocked.”
When you think of the 1960s revolution, a group of Roman Catholic nuns may not be who you envision, but Pedro Kos’ documentary “Rebel Hearts” asserts the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary’s place in the history of rebellion. 
Using the footage gathered over the course of two decades by producer Shawnee Isaac-Smith, the documentary tells the story of a group of nuns who fought against the patriarchal Catholic Church to modernize the sisterhood and reclaim a sense of personal freedom. Combining classic talking head interviews, archival footage, newspaper headlines and animations, creates a gripping documentary about a side of Catholicism rarely seen.
In the 1960s the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart became the home of strong, independent women who saw it as the only alternative path to becoming a housewife. Being married to Jesus, they were forced to become teachers with no training and adhere to a strict schedule of when to pray, eat and sleep. But Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles was an intellectual hub where women from all disciplines could study and create.
The idea of the stone cold, ruler-wielding nun originated when women who joined the convent fresh out of high school were forced to teach classes of 70 students because the cCardinals determined that was what women were only good for. This film proceeds to dismantle this idea, showing a different side of nuns that most people would never know. 
The women soon rejected the rigid religious role imposed on them by the church and instead carried out God’s word as they saw fit. There was an increasing dedication to social justice in the convent. Members attended the Selma march alongside Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and protested with farmers demanding better working conditions. Despite being arrested multiple times, the Sisters were willing to put their bodies on the line to fight for equality, which they saw as their Christian duty.
The film used Sister Corita Kent as an example of how the nuns used their platform at Immaculate Heart to find their power. Sister Kent used her natural artistic talent to create work that combined theological references with social issues to appeal to the youth. Her global success is juxtaposed with the local cardinal’s reprimendment of her work, with him placing restrictions on when and what she could create.
Many women sought to reform the habit, the religious attire nuns wear, as well because they felt it created a barrier between them and other people. In one poignant interview, a nun is overtly crestfallen when a reporter says he is much more uncomfortable speaking with her when she is in her religious attire. This is the turning point of the documentary, when the women realize that their want to do good is being obstructed by the church’s archaic rules.
Well-intentioned reforms are quickly met with criticism from local church officials. The men of the church resisted change as the nuns’ autonomy would lessen their own power. The conflict escalated all the way to the Vatican, where initial efforts to modernize the church were later rescinded after an outcry of people uncomfortable with change swayed opinion. Eventually, rather than submit to patriarchal, archaic rules, over three hundred sisters renounced their vows and formed their own community, which is still thriving today.
The documentary’s stylistic editing helped maintain an engaging pace and used animation and graphics to fill in gaps with no footage. Clippings of newspaper headlines from the ’60s and ’70s calling the sisterhood “The Pope’s Unruly Flock” and other demeaning names juxtaposed the nuns’ good intentions versus how the public spun it into a scandal.
Many nuns were liberal, progressive, kind hearted and extremely funny. But it was those types of women who were harassed, scrutinized and eventually forced out of the church for fighting for their right to do good in the world. While the documentary used source material from the 1950s to the modern day, it remained focused on its mission to give a voice to these previously silenced women.
A story of feminine resilience, the documentary gives a new perspective on what religion meant to women in the convent and all of the overlooked sexism they had to overcome.

Queer priest, lawyer, activist and author Pauli Murray is a revolutionary figure previously lost in history. Barely scratching the surface of their extraordinary life, the documentary “My Name is Pauli Murray” gives an overview of Murray’s life from their train-hopping adolescence to graduating seminary school at the age of 65.
Inspiring figures like Justices Thurgood Marshall and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Murray’s life work set the foundation for civil rights law, ending segregation and fighting for gender equality. They popularized the idea of Jane Crow, the now-accepted idea that Black women experience racism differently than Black men. They created the approach of arguing segregation laws as unconstitutional rather than trying to prove the inequality of the separate-but-equal legislation, a tactic that was continually failing.
Along with all of their professional achievements, the documentary highlighted Murray’s personal life and celebrated their queer identity to successfuly paint a full picture of who they were as an individual, not just as a professional lawyer. Murray wrestled with their gender identity for most of their life. They wrote to doctors asking for hormone injections to correct an imbalance and often presented themselves androgynously. The film also revealed lesser known details of Murray’s life, such as their long term relationship with Irene Barlow who Murray described as their “silent partner.” 
Murray’s queerness had to be hidden during their lifetime, but the documentary finally liberated the love that inspired them to keep fighting. The choice to include these personal details was critical to understanding Murray’s journey as a whole, and the visibility of successful, intersectional, historical figures is critical for the present day LGBTQ+ community.
Murray was before their time in almost every respect, but now that society has progressed, the documentary creates a true legacy that would certainly make them proud. 
Murray made strides toward gender equality as well, co-founding the National Organization for Women to protect women’s rights. The legal groundwork Murray helped establish along with their prolific writing later inspired Justice Ginsberg. Ginsberg spoke in the film, praising Murray’s dedication to equality and explaining how critical their work was to today’s civil rights law.
Condensing a revolutionary life into an hour and a half was not an easy task, but the film remained focused on the major achievements in Murray’s journey while also acknowledging all of the barriers they faced. Accurately explaining these complex societal issues in such a short period of time is also not an easy task, but the documentary worked because it always concentrated on telling the story through Murray’s perspective.
The filmmakers Betsy West and Julie Cohen were no strangers to creating a film about the life of a powerful woman, as they were the team behind the 2018 documentary “RBG”. Consisting of mostly talking head interviews, the documentary adhered to a standard format similar to most PBS or History Channel documentaries. However, the lack of engaging visuals was made up for by the fact that every moment of Murray’s life was something unique and unprecedented, keeping viewers glued to the screen. 
One of the standout films at Sundance, the film served to fix the historical inaccuracy of overlooking Pauli Murray. A trailblazing feminist, a queer icon and a talented lawyer, Murray will finally be remembered as the pioneering figure they have always been.

This review contains spoilers.
Reimagined in Carey Williams’ Gen Z inspired “R#J” is the infamous age-old story of star-crossed lovers, Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet.” Set in the modern day, this rendition follows Romeo and Juliet as they fall in love entirely through social media and their smartphone screens. 
Straying from the original script, the characters use modern-day slang through text and social media but Shakespearean English in video calls/livestreams. Though a unique selling point at first, after about 15 minutes when social media’s gimmick wears off, the film is left constrained by these tropes.
The ingenuity of this film is undeniable. Even through phone screens, the shots were well-composed, utilizing dreamy production design and angelic back-lit lighting to give it a cinematic look. Despite being seen through a phone, the film has a rectangular aspect ratio similar to that of a regular 1.85:1 movie which also contributes to the cinematic feeling.
Performances by the cast carried the film through its dull moments. The cast was composed of Black and brown actors, bringing some much-needed diversity to the world of Shakespeare. 
Romeo (Camaron Engels) and Juliet (Francesca Noel) captures the hormone-possessed spirit of the young lovers with ease. However, the standout performance was held by Siddiq Saunderson who played Mercutio. Saunderson commanded every scene, playing Mercutio’s comedic intensity in an ostentatious, extravagant manner. Bringing such passion and life to every scene, his final duel with Tybalt was all the more tragic as the film was left with a tangible hole.
Though the character of Paris was omitted from the plot, his Instagram profile did make a cameo depicting him as an e-boy Soundcloud rapper.
Some moments are heartwarmingly familiar to young audiences who know what it’s like to establish a connection virtually. Creating a shared playlist, sending cheeky gifs and rephrasing the same risky text over and over echo the current methods of flirtation. However, the film lacked an understanding of the nuances of Gen Z on social media. There were little details such as texts ending with a period or Romeo using the video chat feature on Instagram to contact Tybalt that didn’t authentically replicate how social media is used by young people today.
Because of inaccuracies like these, the film becomes gimmicky, feeling like a high school society play. It is unintentionally funny, yet wants to be taken seriously. 
The primary issue with the film being restricted to the medium of social media is that it creates a lack of intimacy between characters. Couples do not film their most intimate moments and aside from some photoshoots and homemade videos that ultimately felt performative, this lack of intimacy lowered the stakes of the romance and kept audiences at arm’s length. These moments of true affection between the couple feel voyeuristic, as this personal moment was no longer theirs as all the viewers were intruding.
The new format also creates some complications regarding the original plot. In the play, the two lovers’ tragic fate is the result of a lack of communication and with the film taking place through a communication device, the narrative is changed.
The reimagining of Shakespeare’s “Romeo and Juliet” with a diverse cast, familiar slang and social media opens it up to a broader audience. It overcomes the idea that Shakespeare is boring and out of date. However, the youthful audience “R#J” was made for may not connect with this aggressive appeal.

Usually relegated to the corners of the Marshall School of Business and campus investing clubs, the stock market was on the front of students’ minds this week after GameStop’s stock surged 1000% since last year, capturing the imagination of students hoping to strike it rich overnight. 
“Everything about [the stock surge] is really crazy, especially how it happened so suddenly,” said Steve Nguyen, a sophomore majoring in business administration and a founder of quantitative finance club Quant SC. 
GameStop surged after an army of non-professional investors on the Reddit forum WallStreetBets decided to target the stock and push its price up, in part motivated by the fact that major hedge funds had decided to short sell the stock. Short selling occurs when investors bet that the price of a stock will decrease, causing them to  borrow shares of the stock and sell it, hoping to buy them back at a lower price.
If the stock’s price rises while investors are short selling it, they are forced to cover the shares that they borrowed. This situation, known as a short squeeze, pushes the price of the stock even higher because additional shares are bought.
To initiate a short squeeze of GameStop’s stocks, non-professional investors utilized Robinhood, an app which allows users to participate in commission-free trading, to buy shares of the stock. 
“Robinhood precipitated this democratization of the financial markets, [and] it basically took something that was only available to institutional asset managers and money managers with large amounts of capital and … made that [accessible],” said Garret Nourse, co-president of USC Value Investing Group. 
Robinhood, with a mission to “democratize finance for all,” was founded in 2013 and had 13 million accounts as of May 2020. 
“I think the most interesting part of the whole situation is how trading, especially market making, has become much more equalized as a result of Robinhood … I think the important thing to take away is that this shows a trend of decentralization [in trading],” Nguyen said. “I think it’s a really interesting movement how a lot of older institutions are now becoming more decentralized. People have a lot more power now than they did years ago.”
However, Nguyen doesn’t anticipate that these new trends will alter his investing strategies, instead he prefers to focus on the long-term picture and analysis.
“You can’t create these strategies directly based off what’s happening within the past week,” he said. “It’s not going to be statistically significant.”
Lawrence Harris, the Fred V. Keenan Chair in finance and professor of finance and business economics at Marshall, spoke about the dangers of the current market conditions, particularly for non-professional investors.
“We’re not talking about playing a game here, where the money doesn’t matter. This is real money,” Harris said. “We’re not talking about democracy here, we’re talking about price manipulation. There should not be game playing in the financial markets.”
According to Harris, despite temporary success for non-professional investors, larger hedge funds will ultimately win out.
“There’s going to be a huge number of people who bought the stock at high prices, and they’re going to lose,” Harris said. “In the end, there’s no amount of retail money that can stand against enough institutional [money].”
For Nourse and the USC Value Investing Group, these market trends differed greatly from the stock and finance strategies they study. Members of the organization spend their first year learning about stocks and finance until, at the end of the semester, they pitch a stock to senior members in the group.
“I would call us the antithesis of day-trading. That’s not what we do at all,” Nourse said. “At the end of the day, if you don’t have, in today’s markets, a quantitative or an algorithmic strategy, and you’re not part of the 0.1% of people who are just born traders, then it’s ultimately gambling.”
With GameStop’s stock value already decreasing since its initial surge, Nguyen is still optimistic that the surge was beneficial in increasing interest in trading and investing. 
“No matter the reason why you get into it, now that more people are more into investing and their personal finances, I think people are better off as a result,” he said.

Content warning: The film and this review depict instances, sometimes very graphic, of verbal and sexual assault, including gender-based violence.
This review contains spoilers.
The circuitous nature of life in “Beginning” arrests its viewer and its protagonist in a boxed film format, rendering both to the limits it allows. What follows is a wrenching devolution of faith, trust and a woman’s very being; the beginning to an end.
Director Dea Kulumbegashvili’s feature debut centers on a rural Georgian town just outside of Tbilisi, where Jehovah’s Witnesses come together in a small white church within the confines of a majority Orthodox Christian population and neighborhood.
While you listen in on David’s sermon, played by co-writer Rati Oneli, from behind the pews at the back of the room, you’re privy to a reflection on faith at its most vulnerable. As the story of the binding of Isaac comes to its conclusion, and God tells Abraham, “now I know you fear God,” the red carpet that leads people into the church comes alive with red flames. 
The burned church is a warning, nothing new to David, his parishioners or the police who decide to turn the other way. Insistent on rebuilding, David travels to meet the elders for material support, leaving his wife, Yana (Ia Sukhitashvili) and son Giorgi (Saba Gogichaishvili) alone.
A detective from Tbilisi, Alex (Kakha Kintsurashvili) as we come to know, travels down on the pretense of investigating, but is there for something much more sinister. He’s at the fire, watching the building slowly turn to embers, but where does he go?
On the pretense of meeting with David, the detective goes to their residence one night, asking Yana about motive and suspects until his tone turns coercive. There are no sounds but the creak of Yana shifting in her chair and the voice of the detective as he verbally assaults her off-screen. 
After the attack, and at many times in the film, Yana returns to check on Giorgi as he sleeps. His face is framed by soft moonlight, magnified by the white of his blankets and pajamas. Her eyes are downcast, and rarely do they come up again except to gaze at her own angel.
Despite concerns of their safety in the neighborhood, Yana takes Giorgi outside for toys and fresh air. Landing in a green field dotted with yellow flowers, Yana lies down and closes her eyes as we watch from above, motionless for minutes on end. The camera moves maybe four times in the entire film, and here it is a slow pan from Giorgi’s concerned visage to his mom laying on the ground. She doesn’t move to the point where her son thinks she may be dead, and when she rises from the practical joke, Giorgi doesn’t let her go. We see their embrace from a respectful distance, but the position of the camera doesn’t take away from the tenderness of the moment. 
When back at the house, cinematographer Arseni Khachaturan traps us. Unable to see around corners or away from where Yana rests on a living room chair, the dwelling juxtaposes the freeness of the outdoors. We hear the thud near the door of their house, but we can’t place it. Yana goes outside to investigate, and arrives at the river, lined with pink flowers whose colors only 35mm could rightly capture — the same place where a long take of Yana and her son traversing the beautiful plain took place just that morning. 
The viewer is at a distance again when the detective grabs Yana, and the camera remains still as the feeling of dread and helplessness rush through to your stomach. It’s a disturbing point of view as you’re forced to watch the brutal sexual assault, going on for minutes until you have nothing but your vision left to connect you to the screen.
Just as Yana’s attacker comes from outside the screen does every other threat emerge. You’re left to discover them as she does, and feel the isolation that these threats of religious persecution and later, misogynistic disbelief, surround and belittle her.
In this film, every single tactic of oppression or gender-based discrimination is weaponized. Khachaturan’s camera refuses to move and let you escape the horror, and instead you’re rendered a passive witness to acts of violence that have rarely dared to be shown on film. 
This is juxtaposed with shots that angle you in God’s eyes, though you know you’re powerless to his will. You look down as the parishioner’s children get baptized into a faith that will be used to scorn them, but they are able to move freely beyond the confines of the film’s edges. In the end, the characters and yourself are left to rely on the belief that there is something better outside of the frame. 
Instead of escaping, Yana’s seeming end becomes a beginning. As if Abraham’s hand was reaching down to her, her ultimate fate is sealed with a drastically different outlook than if she had been stripped of all her faith.
With “Beginning,” Kulumbegashvili decides not to move away from the greatest tests of Yana’s life. It feels torturous at times, and numbing at every moment. Despite my revulsion, I couldn’t look away, because on that screen was partly the bravery to come face to face with some of the most horrific violence, isolation and othering a woman can endure. It couldn’t have been in any other way.

Two mottos guide the work of the Philologos Society, an organization founded by Richard Petrosyan in 2019: “Live a century and learn a century” and “succeed to serve.” Since its start, the organization, which aims to promote the intellectual growth of its members while serving the Los Angeles area, has been doing just that.  
The Philologos Society got its name from the Ancient Greek word philos meaning friend/love and logos meaning study/word/argument. Petrosyan, a junior majoring in neuroscience, said he wanted the club to have a meaningful name that represented the society’s mission to create a community with a love for expanding their intellectual knowledge and interests by sharing in a safe environment. 
The Philologos Society offers an academic branch and humanitarian branch — each corresponding with the “succeed” and “serve” aspects of the motto, respectively, Petrosyan said. In a year and a half, the organization has amassed 45 members who work to have important discussions with one another while serving the greater L.A. community, through services like meal delivery to those in need and providing feedback to high school and middle school debate teams, even amid the pandemic. 
“If you are a machine that knows everything, that succeeds to the best capacity that a human could possibly do, and if you’re alone on Earth, what’s the purpose?” Petrosyan said. “You’re not going to realize yourself, you’re not going to self actualize or make an impact if you’re not doing it for society ultimately. So that was the rationale behind succeeding to serve all the while learning while living your entire life.”
In the summer of 2020, Petrosyan reached out to Margaret Talai, operations coordinator at Meals on Wheels, to form a partnership. Meals on Wheels is an organization that delivers meals and checks in on elderly people and people with disabilities. Petrosyan had previously volunteered for Meals on Wheels in 2015 after moving to L.A. from France.
Talai said she was pleased about partnering with the Philologos Society and coordinating a food delivery schedule with Petrosyan that involved shift rotations to meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and protect the Meals on Wheels staff, volunteers and clients amid the pandemic. Due to coronavirus restrictions, many of the Meals on Wheels clients have been cut off from the outside world, she said. As a result, the organization implemented a phone reassurance policy in which volunteers — many of whom were Philologos Society members volunteering from home — would call clients and talk to them in order to check up on them and provide them with social interaction. 
“When you [give back] you feel better about yourself and you’re giving more to someone who needs it,” Talai said. “Feeding people who are homebound, to make sure they see somebody on a regular basis, get a ‘’Hello, hi, how are you?’’ checking up on them on a regular basis — that’s what it’s all about.” 
The Philologos Society has also partnered with the L.A. Metropolitan Debate League, a nonprofit that teaches public speaking to underprivileged high school and middle school students. The Philologos Society helps by judging monthly debate tournaments. Society members connect with LAMDL debate teams on the online tournament platform Tabroom and provide feedback for the students’ next debates in the higher leagues on “ballots” that allow the members to point grade the debaters.
“We try to provide [the feedback] so that they can be better debaters, better public speakers, more confident speakers — that they become more eloquent, don’t use parasitic words, create and structure their arguments better,” Petrosyan said. “These are all the types of details that we try to instill, to the best of our capacity, all the while remaining as neutral as possible — but unfortunately you have to choose a winner in the end.” 
The Philologos Society also formed a partnership with USC Hybrid High School and Clinton Middle School. After conducting a survey at the schools to discover what topics interest the students, a project leader from the Philologos Society is elected to give the students a lesson in the topic of choice. The Society aims to expose students to topics that are generally not discussed in school to broaden their knowledge, through Zoom meetings twice a month. 
Sean Silva, a junior majoring in history and archaeology, is vice president of the organization. Silva is responsible for coordinating meetings, student presentation schedules and guest speakers. He continues to do reassurance calls for Meals on Wheels from his hometown of Washington DC.
“What attracts people is just a sense of connection,” Silva said. “We love sharing knowledge and we love learning from each other and a lot of what you’re doing both in the meeting activities and the volunteering activities is just sharing things with people, talking to people. I think that’s the big attraction, it’s just an open place to talk about big issues in philosophy, archaeology, medicine, whatever field you’re interested in, it’s a great place to meet people and to have an amazing conversation.”
Due to the pandemic restrictions, most Philologos Societies programs take place over Zoom. Silva said going online made coordinating more practical for him since he no longer has to arrange transportation. 
Silva coordinates the internal symposium where, similarly to the high school presentations, members present a topic of their choice to other society members. The presenter raises an issue and exposes the members to a field outside of their majors that they can learn and then debate about. He also coordinates guest speakers from different departments around campus offering the students an opportunity to network and take the guest speakers’ college classes.
The Philologos Society also offers documentary screenings chosen by a society member presenter, now in an online setting due to coronavirus restrictions. The presenter then leads the discussion about the documentary and comes up with motivational questions so the group can debate the topic at hand. The documentary must put forward an issue or controversy that members can voice their opinions and argue for or against. 
The Philologos Society recently created an online publication called “The Philologos Times” where members publish two types of content, analytical articles and scientific articles. The club also created a YouTube channel called Philologos Society at USC designed to make small educational miniseries. The society also conducts a high school writing contest encouraging high schoolers to submit 500 word moral or messaged-based short stories and get publication credit from a university intellectual society. 
Lillian Goodwin, a sophomore majoring in journalism, is in charge of communications at the Philologos Society. She reaches out to professors, advisors and department heads from different schools within the University to bring diverse perspectives into the club and cultivate conversations where members can work to understand each other’s different opinions. Petrosyan said freedom of speech is central to the Philologos Society’s discussions. 
“One of the big things about this society is that it’s not as academic and austere as it sounds,” Goodwin said. “We’re really trying to be inclusive and accepting of everyone and cultivate intellectualism obviously but also ensure that nobody feels like they don’t have what it takes to participate … we really want to make sure everyone belongs.”

Just to be clear, I am not TikTok famous, nor am I a TikTok expert. I am just another Gen Zer who found themselves downloading the app as another means to procrastinate doing schoolwork and distract themselves from the uncertainty of the pandemic.
With a “for you” page of content curated to my liking and a stream of content that could take a lifetime to consume, I found every moment of my free time being spent on the app. I did not feel too guilty about having so much of my screen time being spent on TikTok because I realized I was actually learning a thing or two. 
This column is meant to give TikTok the credit I think it deserves. It is not just an app for influencers who keep up with dance trends and memes, it is also a place where interesting conversations about political, social and popular culture are taking place. 
During election season, politicians became cognizant of this too and decided to take advantage of an audience of millions of young voters on the app. The first time I saw a politician in my feed, it was former 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang. He was lip syncing to “The Box” by Roddy Ricch while holding stacks of fake money and telling viewers to go out and vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Not used to seeing any political figures in this element, I was taken aback. Maybe it was because I was so used to politicians wanting to ban TikTok that I did not think one would ever actually join the app. 
It makes sense though. For the younger generation, social media is where we get our news, and more importantly, how we form our political opinions, so politicians finally met the young voters where they were, TikTok. 
Before being elected, Georgia Sen. Jon Ossoff caught the attention of young voters by participating in the #RenaissanceChallenge and making videos to trending sounds. He even gave a tour of his campaign bus showing his snack cabinet and overfilled closet. The night before the Senate runoff in Georgia, he posted a TikTok praising the record-breaking youth voter turnout and first-time voters. 
This is a prime example of the transparency and realness from political candidates that we have been missing. It gets tiring listening to politicians who, more often than not, are old white men, tell us what to believe in or who to vote for, while also keeping the inner workings of legislation a secret from the very people they are supposed to be helping. 
By using TikTok, understanding politics becomes accessible to young people while also giving them a direct line of communication to politicians. The effort made by certain politicians — such as Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey or Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey Jr. — to answer questions they are asked, connect with the young audience and partake in trends creates a larger appeal for said audience to go and vote for that candidate. 
Gen Zers on all sides of the political spectrum have created political houses, similar to the hype house of famous TikTokers such as Charli D’Amelio and Addison Rae, to express their support. Pages such as the @therepublicanhypehouse and @tiktokleftists have been created for people to share commentary on their political ideologies. 
As TikTok continues to gain recognition as a hub for Millenials and Gen Z, I would not be surprised to see more and more people in office join the app. With the ability for instantaneous consumption of news and opinions, it is only a matter of time before TikTok becomes a go-to social media platform, such as Twitter and Facebook, for information.
Not everyone likes TikTok, and that is totally OK. I am not trying to force anyone to download the app. Instead, I hope that people will see it in a new light and appreciate its significance in how discourse surrounding current events is being spread among the younger generation. TikTok can be a balance of entertainment and education, that is something I hope to emulate in this column.

As USC begins the spring semester online, students and staff alike continue to struggle with managing college and home life. Zoom fatigue has become very common during this time of online school. Zoom fatigue can be defined as feelings of exhaustion or feeling drained during or after a Zoom meeting. Along with this fatigue, it is also common to become restless in lectures and experience an inability to stay attentive during class.
Zoom fatigue can feel different for each individual, but it is an inevitable outcome of fully remote online instruction. It can be worse during longer lectures that are not as interactive and are content heavy because students have to focus more intently on what is being said without the help of peers. In addition, being in a Zoom room for more than an hour hearing a professor talk for the majority of the time can cause tiredness. 
At USC, there are courses that run for two hours or more, and although students choose their courses for each semester, more often than not, every student has at least one course that is longer than one hour. For example, some General Education requirement classes go on for more than an hour and every student is required to take up to eight GE courses over the course of their academic career. 
Although these courses would have been the same length in person, in-person learning makes it easier to be attentive in class, since it is in an academic setting with everyone physically in the same room. Online, students have to sit through classes in their room, kitchen or other rooms in their house, which can be a more distracting environment than a classroom at USC. And unlike in-person courses, online classes are solely online so students lose the verbal and social nature of being fully in-person. This is a major cause of Zoom fatigue.
The Zoom fatigue students feel during this time is partially because of the length of the courses. Although the length of courses are set for a reason — that time is needed to complete the lesson plans of the professors — and shouldn’t be changed, the University should look at ways to combat Zoom fatigue for their longer courses. 
Last semester, some professors who taught classes that were longer than an hour would split the time of their lecture with a 10 minute break in between. This break was as much for the students as it was for the professors teaching the class. 
Another tool was to split the class so that half of it was a lecture and the other half was breakout rooms with students discussing the content. This second solution may remedy some of that lack of social interaction students are experiencing during these times. Both tools helped students engage with the content and combated the tiresome task of sitting in class, listening to the professor speak for hours on end. 
USC has tried to keep students engaged outside of classes during this time by hosting online events, coffee talks and mentoring meetings. The University should also consider how to keep students engaged within their classes. 
A break will allow students and professors alike to stretch, grab a snack or use the restroom so that they can remain attentive throughout the remainder of the class. Providing a break or finding other alternatives to combat Zoom fatigue should be implemented by the USC community across disciplines.

As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, sports franchises around the world have been forced to find creative ways to cut costs and minimize losses. Without fans in the stands, teams have had to make do without the traditional revenue that would come by way of ticket, concession and merchandise sales. 
For some franchises, the pandemic has accelerated an ongoing financial downturn. Professional teams around the world have cut player wages, requested federal aid and even gotten rid of mascots in order to minimize the economic burden caused by the pandemic. For an example of a club hit hard by the pandemic, look no further than Spain’s FC Barcelona. Rumors of financial turmoil at Barcelona have been swirling for a few years now, but recent reports indicate the club’s debt has surpassed $1 billion. 
Barca has always been willing to take financial risks, as the club made major investments into its global and digital presence in 2018 in an effort to become the first club to surpass a billion euros in annual revenue. While the world’s second most valuable club fell just short of that mark prior to the pandemic, its finances have only worsened since. While many top European clubs usually possess a significant amount of debt at any given time, Barcelona’s debt is exceptionally high. 
Nonetheless, while the club mires through its worst financial crisis in history, the club has gone about transfer and contractual business as usual. A recent report from Spanish publication El Mundo revealed one player in particular, Lionel Messi, has been living particularly comfortably. The report showed Messi’s most recent deal, signed in 2017, was the largest in sports history. Over four seasons, Messi’s deal is valued at just over $670 million, including incentives.  
While Messi and fellow FC Barcelona players agreed to a wage cut to help offset losses, Messi’s case is different from his teammates and it should be treated as such. No other player on Barcelona’s roster makes nearly as much annually. In fact, you’d struggle to find another athlete in the world who makes those figures. While players undoubtedly are told to maximize their earnings while they’re in their physical prime, a player taking in close to $150 million per season should probably be treated as an exception. 
To be fair, Messi and his teammates not only agreed to a pay cut, but they also offered to cover the remaining salaries of staff members who had their wages cut. Despite the 70% player wage cut and the offer to cover staff salaries, Barcelona still cut members of its staff, citing concerns related to the pandemic and loss of match-day revenue. Make no mistake, Barcelona is not the only club losing tremendous amounts of revenue, but it does seem like the only club this deep in trouble. Barca is also the only club laying off long-serving staff members in order to pay one man, who openly expressed his desire to leave the club this summer, upwards of $100 million annually.  
The issue here is not with Messi. Rather, blame should be placed on those who managed Barcelona’s finances so poorly that it ended up in this position. A club of this stature should not have to furlough non-playing staff as quickly as Barcelona did. Other top-flight European soccer clubs have reversed decisions to furlough staff after receiving backlash from the public. Barcelona chose to follow through with its furlough, while paying one player likely more than what it would have cost to keep every member of the staff it let go. 
Messi and Barcelona know how bad this looks. It’s probably why they’ve already taken legal action against those who leaked the report.
The issue and solution here are both quite simple. To be frank, Barcelona laying off staff for “financial reasons” while privately playing a single player almost $150 million a season is despicable. Asking players to take wage cuts and needing them to cover salary for other employees is borderline dumpster-fire-esque. But worst of all, this could have been avoided by either making Messi’s contract public when it was signed in 2017, or restructuring player contracts to accommodate for staff salaries at the beginning of the pandemic. 
Player salaries are astronomical. Staff salaries aren’t. A path to righting its wrongs is there if those at FC Barcelona want it. Based on what we’ve seen so far, though, the club will continue to tarnish its image. 
Moving forward, Barcelona’s brass should not pretend they don’t have money to pay their staff when they do. They just don’t want to.
