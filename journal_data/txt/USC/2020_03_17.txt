The Office of International Services has closed its physical locations on both the University Park and Health Sciences campuses, the office announced in an email to international students Saturday.
OIS staff will continue to respond to emails sent to the office address, the email read. The office will offer remote services until further notice. In the email, OIS stated it would send international students their immigration documents by mail.
“Although we have planned for the possibility of this change due to COVID-19, our operational plan will continue to evolve in the days ahead,” the email read.
The transition to online instruction has presented unique challenges for international students, who may face difficulty returning home. Students able to vacate their on-campus residences have been encouraged to do so to promote social distancing and slow the spread of coronavirus, but students unable to return to their permanent residences are permitted to remain on campus if they email USC Housing.
The University will continue to support the international student population and offer virtual coursework for students who are unable to return to campus by the time in-person classes resume, Provost Charles Zukoski told the Daily Trojan in an interview.
“If [international] students leave the country and cannot get back, then we are delivering education online,” Zukoski said. “We are committed to supporting [students’] academic progress, so we want the students to know that we’re going to work with them under those circumstances.”
USC’s informational website on coronavirus includes a page of topics relevant to international students, including travel, housing and immigration services. The site recommends international students contact OIS by email to discuss visa status before making plans to return to their home countries.
International students will be permitted to take classes virtually during the remote instruction period, in accordance with the Student Exchange Visitor Program’s policies for non-U.S. citizens enrolled at U.S. schools.

A petition is circulating online calling on USC to give students the option to alter the grading policy to pass/no pass for the spring semester. Created Monday night, it claims that the stress surrounding coronavirus, along with classes shifting online for the rest of the semester, may potentially affect academic performance with students adapting to the new situation. More than 800 people have signed the petition. Another petition created by a different user is also circulating with more than 600 signatures. 
The petition also comes in light of a campuswide email from President Carol Folt Monday announcing that virtual instruction would be extended until the end of the spring semester.
“With the sudden changes to academic progress and all the stress due to the outbreak of COVID-19 the university should give the option to students to change the grading system of this spring semester to pass/no pass,” the petition read. 
Debadrita Bhattacharya, a senior majoring in psychology, created the petition after hearing comments from her residents at New North Residential College who were concerned about how their future grades would be affected by the new online format, especially considering labs, presentations and group projects that require an in-person presence. She also said that her professors have shared similar concerns, specifically in learning to adapt to the new online system. 
“I appreciate the action the University has taken because it was the right call,” Bhattacharya said. “However, I do believe that students and professors are also worried about academics …  It would really help, for classes which are difficult to teach online, that students would have the option of still changing their grading system for classes to pass/no pass, at least have the option to do it.”
Currently, only 24 units may be taken pass/no pass with a maximum of four that can be applied to the general education requirement. Classes taken for major or minor requirements, along with writing classes and classes numbered 390 or 490, must be taken for a letter grade.    
For students adapting to the pandemic, Bhattacharya said that the pass/no pass grading system should be an option that USC provides. 
“This would really alleviate a lot of stress, especially with everything going [on],” Bhattacharya said. “Students have to vacate, students have to adapt to studying online, professors have to adapt to teaching online and how to [interact virtually]  at the same time and make the class as normal as possible at this point.”
Students at universities such as UC Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon University have also petitioned to move courses to a more flexible grading policy that would allow students the option to convert classes to a pass/no pass policy. Both school petitions have garnered more than 3,000 signatures.
Provost Charles Zukoski said the University has not currently instituted a change to grading policy.

USC Student Health can now evaluate and test students with coronavirus symptoms, according to Chief Health Officer Dr. Sarah Van Orman.
Beginning Monday, students may be tested at the station in front of the Engemann Student Health Center. To test for coronavirus, a specimen is collected at a station set up outside the center and sent to a laboratory for evaluation. 
People with cold or flu symptoms, including a cough, sore throat or runny nose, must first make a virtual appointment through TeleHealth, an online platform for medical services. During the appointment, a Student Health caregiver assesses symptoms and determines the best course of action, which may include testing.
“We’re really moving — at Student Health and the rest of the community — from really being worried about returning travelers to, over the last few days, a situation where we’re sort of assuming anyone who has cold or flu symptoms, we have to first assume they have it,” Van Orman said.
Since community transmission has increased, all individuals with coronavirus symptoms are asked to self-quarantine until their test results return — typically a two- to three-day period, Van Orman said. Individuals who test positive for coronavirus should self-isolate for 14 days, the incubation period of the virus.
“It’s very, very important that people [self-isolate],” Van Orman said. “Even if they’re not experiencing significant system symptoms … they may be putting other people in the community at risk.”
All visits for people with respiratory symptoms now take place on the first floor of the student health center, with the second floor reserved for other appointments to lower the risk of contagion. 
Students are encouraged to make consultation appointments on TeleHealth, but Student Health will remain open for urgent care visits. Counseling services offered by Student Health now have virtual alternatives, including “Let’s Talk … On Zoom!” and group and individual sessions with licensed Student Health professionals conducted via TeleHealth. Access to all medical and mental health services, excluding “Let’s Talk,” is restricted to students currently located in California due to licensing requirements.
As of now, two members of the USC community have tested positive for coronavirus, including a student who recently returned from a study abroad program in Europe and a health care professional at Keck Medical Center. Both are in self-isolation.

With its soulful, gritty sound, local band Lily Waters plays music as eclectic as Los Angeles itself.
 The band is fronted by lead vocalist Gabbi Green, a senior majoring in communication. Green, an L.A. native, started playing the keyboard and cello in elementary school. She transitioned to singing and playing the guitar in high school, a time when going to shows all over the city made Green a master of the city’s public transportation. 
“I write a lot of my songs on public transport because I’m taking it all the time,” Green said of her songwriting process. “I’ll sing into my phone sometimes, just an idea. Or I’ll just be playing a guitar and sing something with my guitar. But those ideas will surface even after a few years, like I’ll actually make them a song with my band.”
Green’s musical talents have only grown from her early days of teaching herself the guitar. Since the band’s formation in 2017, Lily Waters has performed at a range of venues including the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books to iconic L.A. venues like The Smell and Lodge Room. 
“We’ve been getting very fortunate with shows and playing big stages,” Green said, highlighting her love of performing live.
Along with Green, the band includes Robert Cifuentes on lead guitar, Danny Deleon on drums and Seamus Blackwell on bass.
Cifuentes and Green write Lily Waters’ music together, creating a sound that is a distinct blend of blues, rock, country pop, jazz, indie and psychedelic rock. Lily Waters’ genre-breaking style makes its music accessible to everyone; people from various generations and backgrounds can enjoy their killer live shows and their evident love of sound.
 The band’s name comes from Green’s own journey with mental health. At 12 years old, she wrote a diary-like book where “Lily” was someone who she imagined herself becoming after overcoming a period of depression. “Waters” comes from the serene, calm imagery of running water and is also a nod to blues musician Muddy Waters, a key influence for the band. 
“Performing as Lily Waters is very empowering for me,” Green said. “I’ve been told that I make people cry, you know, from my voice, and there’s just nothing like [hearing] that. It’s nice to inspire other people knowing that I’ve been inspired by musicians my whole life.”
 Green said playing to crowds of all ages is among one of the band’s favorite aspects of performing, citing a show at the Trancas Country Market in Malibu last fall. 
 “There was a lawn and a bunch of families with their kids setting up lawn chairs, and all these little kids running around while we were playing, which was kind of scary because they were sometimes running through where we were playing,” Green said. “At the end, it was so cute because all these little girls came up and wanted me to autograph stuff for them, and I just put like, ‘Keep rocking’ and ‘Rock on.’ I hope they all become little rock stars.”
Other recent shows include a performance at Tommy’s Place, a live music venue on campus, on Feb. 28. The band was joined by other USC musicians, including Tippy Balady, Ellie Williams and Cordelia.
“[Green] has this very raw and authentic voice,” said Amy Altman, a sophomore majoring in journalism who attended the show. “She engages with her audience really well. She checks in with the audience but also is just such a captivating stage performer.”
 The band signed with Lolipop Records in December 2019, paving the way for an exciting year; with upcoming singles and music videos, including a cover of Gnarls Barkley’s “Crazy,” Lily Waters’ identity as an up-and-coming L.A. powerhouse is evidence of the band’s unbeatable work ethic. 
Lily Waters is performing at a free concert at the Mayfair Hotel Mar. 19. The band will be joined by USC alumnus and musician McCall Kimball, who graduated from Thornton’s popular music program.
“I’m excited because I’m going to be playing some new songs off of a project that is coming out in a couple months,” Kimball said, mentioning her upcoming single, “Disaster.” “It’ll be fun to hear everything [Lily Waters] is doing.”
Putting in long hours, Green balances being a full-time student with touring, recording and her on-campus job with Trojan Event Services. 
“I’m a hustler, that’s a key word I like,” Green said. 
Green’s enthusiasm for music keeps her going, whether she is performing with Lily Waters or playing in Billy Changer, another band she is a part of. Cifuentes, the guitarist in Lily Waters, is the lead vocalist in Billy Changer, with Green on guitar, keys and vocals. With influences in new wave music, Billy Changer’s debut album was released in 2014.
“I feel like some people can’t be kept away from [music],” Green said. “I think I’m gonna be doing this for a long time. I’m fully set on ‘making it,’ whatever that means. I just want to be able to sustain myself from it, honestly, but also to inspire other people.”

If you came to “Big Time Adolescence” looking for a laugh-out-loud stoner comedy featuring “Saturday Night Live’s” Pete Davidson, you came to the wrong place. 
Instead, it’s a coming-of-age film by writer-director Jason Orley, in his feature debut. The movie warns about the dangers of idolizing someone untrustworthy and giving into peer pressure. It follows Mo (Griffin Gluck), your basic high school wallflower. He blends in, doesn’t have many friends and pines after the girl who sits across from him in the classroom. He’s truly not anything special, which typically would lead me to roll my eyes and turn off the film in favor of another. His best friend, though, is a 23-year-old stoner named Zeke (Pete Davidson) who happens to be his sister’s ex-boyfriend. 
Mo is tired of being a nobody. Fortunately for him, he hears about a party going on at his school, and Zeke gives him the idea to start selling drugs to his classmates in order to gain popularity. Suddenly, Mo is the popular kid. People know him, and they want to hang out with him. (The first time he steps into a party carrying the goods in his backpack, Sheck Wes’ “Mo Bamba” plays, which I thought was just a little too on point.) Mo’s crush, Sophie (Oona Laurence), a witty and intelligent girl, even begins to like him back. Mo continues to take more and more of Zeke’s advice until things start to fall apart, leading to an abrupt and rushed ending that is entirely predictable. 
This premise, which seemed so promising, did not deliver on the comedic front. OK, there was one moment where Davidson’s character did terribly off-key karaoke in a bar and the woman he serenaded merely deadpanned back at him that I found amusing. However, the moments meant to evoke the most laughter — such as Mo being forced to reveal his tattoo to his father that reads “TONGUE DADDY” — fell flat and lifeless, leaving me disappointed. 
The core relationship between Mo and Zeke is so unexciting that you wonder why these two people would ever choose to spend time with each another. Mo’s father, Reuben (Jon Cryer), literally asks this very question. The pairing is odd, but not in a way that’s complementary and would cause tension. It simply wasn’t contentious enough to drive the plot — Mo just thinks Zeke is cool. Mo’s idolized Zeke ever since he dated Mo’s older sister, even acting as a third-wheel on their dates. And Zeke loves the feeling of being considered cool. So the two continue to spend time with one another, but their relationship is more like a dog and his owner rather than two friends. They rarely laugh when they’re together, so it’s preposterous that we’re expected to laugh at their antics. 
They could not have cast a more perfect actor for Zeke than Davidson. I’m not sure how difficult it was for him to assume this role, as this is the persona he exudes in all of his acting, especially his recurring role as “Every Chad Ever” on Saturday Night Live. I’d love to see Davidson take on a more serious role to explore his range. On the other hand, his co-star Gluck plays a convincing high school student. He portrayed the changes in Mo’s behavior in a subtle and understated way that crept toward the conclusion instead of leaping to it, but nothing about his performance was particularly memorable. 
The message of the film wasn’t groundbreaking — not that it needed to be. It was yet another reminder not to give in to peer pressure and that you can’t make friends with people who just want something from you. But it was conveyed in the exact same way as it’s been portrayed in many other movies and shows before and did nothing to enhance or develop the message further. The addition of an unreliable guide was a welcome change, but it did little to make the message stick any more than it would have otherwise. It’s a good message, but not one that I needed “Big Time Adolescence” to tell me. 
The Hulu original is a slightly boring depiction of an unlikely friendship between a shy high school student and a 23-year-old burnout that you’re not missing out on if you don’t see. Orley has a long way to go from here, starting with deciding on an original message at the forefront of his film.

In an address to 300 students at an all-girls school in London two years ago, former First Lady Michelle Obama revealed that while she has an impressive repertoire of achievements, she frequently struggles with feelings of not being good enough. This feeling of inadequacy is known as impostor syndrome, a phenomenon that approximately 70% of people experience at some point in their careers, according to a study in the International Journal of Behavioral Science. 
Impostor syndrome was first coined by psychologists Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes in 1978 to describe the internal sense of fraud they observed in high-achieving women. Today, impostor syndrome is known to be prevalent among a broad population regardless of gender. No matter what they achieve and how much validation they receive, people with impostor syndrome are unable to internalize their success, instead believing it to be undeserved or due to luck. As a result, they experience a persistent fear that they will be exposed as frauds.
Impostor syndrome is especially prevalent in high-achieving environments, and college campuses are no exception. A culture of achievement breeds a toxic environment that discourages students from sharing setbacks and challenges with each other, creating a facade of perfection that exacerbates impostor syndrome.
According to Dr. Roshini Pinto-Powell, a professor and dean at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College who frequently meets with students experiencing impostor syndrome, telling students that they are special and that their external achievements — academic awards, athletic feats and so on — got them to where they are is counterproductive. However, this kind of praise is abundant at nearly every university, whether in speeches, posters or everyday conversation. Although the intention is to remind students how remarkable they are, it creates the illusion that everyone is doing well and results in mounting pressure to live up to seemingly impossible ideals.
At its core, impostor syndrome is an identity issue. Each person is intimately acquainted with their own setbacks, and when schools focus solely on successful outcomes and fail to address the challenges along the way, it is easy to compare your own worst moments to everyone else’s best. As students receive constant reminders about the kinds of accomplishments their schools expect of them, those with impostor syndrome experience cognitive dissonance as they struggle to reconcile their own image of themselves with the one set out for them. So, impostor syndrome becomes a very isolating experience.
College is an especially critical period to address impostor syndrome because many students are entering their career fields for the first time. In a survey of 1,000 early-career adults in the United Kingdom, 85% of respondents said they had experienced feelings of inadequacy at work and 70% believed they did not deserve their success. These insecurities are hallmarks of impostor syndrome, yet only a quarter of respondents had heard of the syndrome. The data from this survey reveals that the lack of transparency surrounding impostor syndrome extends well beyond college and continues into the workforce.
Left unchecked, impostor syndrome can manifest in a variety of barriers to everyday life, from poor study habits to serious mental health consequences. For example, according to clinical therapist Carla Lundblade, the cycle of impostor syndrome pushes people to either procrastinate on their responsibilities or spend far too much time tuning it to perfection. Impostor syndrome can spiral into other health problems, including anxiety, depression and elevated levels of the stress hormone cortisol, as Clance and Imes found in the study that established this syndrome.
With these consequences in mind, the first step to mitigating impostor syndrome is to open up discussion surrounding the issue. According to Pinto-Powell, breaking the silence on feelings of self-doubt will not only destigmatize them but also help students realize that it is a mental health issue worth seeking help for. 
Pinto-Powell also recommends praising students for the personal traits that led to their success instead of the accomplishments themselves, which reassures students that they have the capability to persevere in the face of difficulty.
We can also do our part in supporting our friends and peers through impostor syndrome. A study from Brigham Young University found that students in an elite academic program who sought support from people outside their major experienced improved outcomes compared to those who reached out to peers within their program. Talking to people of different backgrounds allows students to gain an outside perspective on their accomplishments, providing a reminder of their personal progress as opposed to constantly comparing themselves to others. These findings speak to the importance of cultivating an open, genuine campus culture where students and faculty feel comfortable sharing their experiences and receiving support from one another.

In recent years, higher education institutions have had a significant increase in their student bodies’ diversity: More women, first-generation, queer people and people of color are going to college than ever before. So it is inevitable for these same students who look different than their predecessors to eventually recognize that their professors and university staff often do not look like them, nor do they share many key experiences unique to their demographics.
College isn’t easy. Even though Elle Woods from the cinematic masterpiece “Legally Blonde” rhetorically asked “What, like it’s hard?” when she got into Harvard Law School, it is generally accepted that the university experience can be an uphill battle for many. 
The pressures to be academically, socially and professionally successful felt by most students are even harder on those from marginalized communities who must also deal with imposter syndrome and microaggressions. Seeing professors and faculty that come from shared backgrounds and experiences can therefore be the driving force that inspires students, keeping them going when they are met with challenges. 
According to the National Journal for Publishing and Mentoring Doctoral Student Research, diversifying faculty is beneficial to the education of all students and reduces cases of discrimination in and outside of the classroom. Data collected in 2019 shows that while USC’s student body was 29% white, about 36% of the student body was reportedly either Asian, African American or Hispanic. Faculty, however, was 65% white in 2016, with a majority of nonwhite faculty not tenured at the University. USC’s failure to provide a faculty able to fully represent the student body not only disadvantages students outside of the dominant group but may also perpetuate a hostile or noninclusive campus culture for marginalized students.
Diversifying university faculty means that underrepresented students will not only know that they have someone to talk to when they are struggling, but will also see people who actually look like them in high-level academia, which allows them to potentially envision themselves taking part in the same institutions in the future.
Diversifying faculty at universities can also provide students with the necessary practice of expanding their worldview because they can learn from people whose cultures and experiences differ from their own. Most campuses may not be indicative of how unique the world is, so providing the social awareness that prepares students for their future as productive members of society is vital to their success. 
Beyond that, we need experts who fit into certain communities to teach students about those very same communities. Whether it be a class on queer studies or East Asian politics, these individuals bring a high level of nuance and understanding to their classes. This isn’t to say in any way that a form of self-segregation should be attached to what university faculty can and cannot teach. It does, however, beg the question of how much a class may benefit by being taught by an individual outside of the group being studied.
There has been a push for more diverse representation in movies, television and fashion. This concept doesn’t come out of thin air — time and time again, it’s been proven that representation helps normalize the experiences of marginalized communities. The same can ultimately be applied to colleges and universities, where seeing a professor that looks like you or was also a first-generation college student can mean all the difference in a student’s confidence and stability.

Everyone, please re-watch some basketball.
Yes, I know the NBA season has been suspended. I know that March Madness is canceled. I know that restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters have been shut down all over the country and that your daily life has most likely been upended by the spread of coronavirus and the various efforts by both the local and national government to suppress the virus’ progress.
But still, I’m begging you, please go re-watch some basketball. 
No, I’m not talking about watching just any basketball game. I’m not talking about last week’s fever-dream loss that was the Lakers’ 104-102 loss to the floundering Brooklyn Nets, and I’m sure as hell not asking you to put yourself through the emotional roller coaster that was the USC men’s team’s painfully inconsistent early February stretch.
Instead, I’m talking about performances such as the one LeBron James offered up on Feb. 23 against the Boston Celtics, when the 16-time NBA All-Star posted up against Celtics stud Jaylen Brown in an isolation set and sank a spinning jump shot with only 30 seconds left to give the Lakers the lead and the victory. 
I’m thinking of plays like the one that USC senior guard Jonah Mathews made during the Trojans’ last game of the regular season. Down by 1 against UCLA with less than nine seconds left, Mathews caught an inbound pass, jogged past midcourt to the 3-point arc and nailed a step-back 3-pointer with one second left in the game, sending the crowd into a frenzy on USC’s senior night. 
You’ve seen these types of performances before: buzzer-beating heaves that actually find the net, fadeaway jump-shots that send chills up your spine with only seconds left on the game clock.
Yep, we’re talking clutch plays, when athletes seemingly disregard the weight of the world and find ways to succeed when the stakes are highest. Call them what you want — daggers, proof that ice actually does run in some humans’ veins. Whatever you decide to call it, there’s been more than enough examples of it recently, and it’s painfully obvious that we as a society are not taking note. 
On Feb. 23, did anyone see LeBron panic? Nope. He literally smirked before sending the Lakers’ perennial rival packing in front of a crowd of almost 20,000.
On March 7, did I watch Mathews tremble under the pressure, panic or force a bad shot? No! The 22-year-old calmly strode down the court, cool and collected and sank the shot of a lifetime seemingly with ease.
In stark contrast, when I went to Target on March 14, did I see orderly groups of shoppers calmly picking up groceries and other daily essentials? No! I saw a veritable mob; grown men with their arms outstretched like kangaroo pouches to collect and protect as much toilet paper as humanly possible.
I saw packs of humanity, grabbing at any meat, vegetable, grain or microwavable dish they could get their hands on; empty shelves and lines so long that you would have thought that our Lord and savior himself had returned in the form of a cashier. It is with this image in mind that I remind everyone that I recognize that the present and future are very uncertain and frightening. I understand your fears and believe me, I am just as afraid.
But in this incredibly precarious moment, please look back at some of the clutch examples set forth by some of basketball’s best and remember — do not panic. Do not go out and rob your local grocer dry. Grocery stores are not closing down anytime soon, and retailers are already reassuring the public that supply chains are still strong and food shortages are not on the horizon. Also, if everyone keeps wiping their shelves clean of toilet paper, what do you expect your fellow Americans to wipe their ass with — taco shells? Palm fronds?
Also, because so many people decided to buy every edible product that Trader Joe’s has to offer, I’m now counting down the days until my modest supply of flavor-blasted goldfish runs out and I’m forced to begin my new life as a hunter-gatherer. 
In all sincerity, however, the situation is serious and lives really are on the line. Please, try to learn something from James and Mathews: Don’t panic, be a team player and try to remain calm and collected. Your team, the American public, is counting on you.

A little past 7:45 p.m. last Wednesday, the USC baseball team finished off a 7-3 victory over visiting Xavier in a game that had been rescheduled the day before due to rain. It was a smooth game for USC. Junior shortstop Ben Ramirez went 2-for-4 with a couple of RBIs and a solo homer. Sophomore righty Ethan Reed pitched a couple innings and struck out three to earn the win. The skies were clear enough, and it was a relatively normal game for the Trojans — other than the fact that there were no fans in attendance due to USC’s restriction of home game spectators in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
And other than the fact that it would be the last Trojan win in any sport for the spring semester.
On Thursday, about 14 hours after the baseball game, USC men’s basketball head coach Andy Enfield and his team were getting ready for a Pac-12 Tournament showdown against Arizona. Enfield and the Trojans’ quarterfinal against the Wildcats was just five hours away.
That game — and the one right before it at noon between Oregon and Oregon State — would not be played. The entire sports world was effectively sent into oblivion.
Thursday developed like a firestorm. In the morning, all Power 5 conferences canceled their tournaments. By the end of the day, all NCAA championship competitions had been canceled for the rest of the semester.
The news found USC’s various spring sports coaches differently. Lacrosse head coach Lindsey Munday was on a bus to Arizona for a match. Baseball head coach Jason Gill found out through USC’s athletic administration. Water polo head coach Marko Pintaric found out on Twitter. 
But each coach across USC’s winter and spring sports had to deal with the same reality: a season ripped away, taken by the most unthinkable and unexpected of circumstances. 
“Every day, I actually feel like it stings a little more, to be quite honest,” men’s tennis head coach Brett Masi said. “You know, the first day was this kind of utter shock. And I think the guys are even still in a bit of shock. You don’t know what to do, how to react.”
The most immediate attention was placed on the men’s basketball team, which looked poised for a deep run in the conference tournament and a respectable seed in March Madness.
“It’s not just tough for our players but for seniors across the country,” said Enfield, who said he was on a conference call when the NCAA Tournament was canceled. “Our grad transfers never got to play in the tournament.”
But it wasn’t just basketball that could have made waves in NCAA championship competition. The women’s water polo team was ranked No. 1 in the country before the cancellation. Men’s tennis was No. 1. Lacrosse was No. 7. The baseball team was 10-5 on the young season and a few days removed from a victory over No. 2 Vanderbilt.
Just like that, after all the practices, games and anticipation, their seasons were over — done. 
“Guys were crying, people were hugging each other,” Gill said. “You know, it’s different when you’re playing and you’re in the postseason or you know your final game’s coming up — you can prepare for that … But when you’re in the middle of something, and in fact, not even in the middle of it yet, we were just getting going, and it gets taken away — that’s a tough pill to swallow.”
After the initial shock and disappointment of the season’s end, the coaches then had to address their respective teams and process the fact that their NCAA competition would have to wait another year. 
“I first sent the team email, and then we had a team meeting later that night so that we could be together, which, as you can imagine, was obviously the hardest meeting I’ve had as a coach,” Munday said. “It was obviously so out of the blue and so quick.”
Despite the disappointment, there’s little to do from here but move forward. And, at least for Pintaric, though the times are unlike any that USC or sports in general have ever seen, turbulence itself is nothing new. 
“[The] last whole year, you learn how to get our disappointments very, very quick out of our way,” Pintaric said. “And then the shift [into a] kind of like an emergency mode to figure out what’s the next best step. So now we are in that mode.”
Gill shared a similar outlook. 
“What I told the team was it’s not just USC, it’s the entire United States and a lot of the world, really,” Gill said. “So we could sit there and feel sorry for ourselves or we could try to find a way of turning a negative into a positive. And that’s what we’re gonna choose to do.”
What exactly are the teams’ next steps? Nobody’s really sure. But the coaches emphasized that, despite not having the rest of the season in front of them, they wouldn’t take time off from staying in touch with their players. 
“I’m here when [the seniors] want to talk through these possible next steps, and obviously to the whole group,” Munday said. “We still want to stay connected as we can [be] even though we’re not together. First and foremost, [I told them] just to stay safe and to stay healthy.”
After all, eventually, when the coronavirus pandemic ends, the sports world will return to normal, as will USC sports. Some players and teams already have their eyes set on the future. 
“Don’t think that [senior] Brandon Holt isn’t finding a court right now — as long as it’s dry — and hitting tennis balls,” Masi said. “All these guys, they love it, and they love it for the right reasons.”
But for now, the future is unknown. All that the coaches know is that right now, it stings, and the loss of the season will be felt for months to come. 
“I woke up Friday morning and we were supposed to play a game,” Gill said. “And I was alright, you know, and then Saturday morning, I woke up, and I was sad. I miss them. You know what I mean? I miss the human beings. I miss the people. It’s tough.”
