The following incidents were reported in the USC Department of Public Safety incident report summary between Monday, March 24, and Tuesday, March 25. 
Crimes against property
at 1:52 p.m. on March 25, a staff member reported that numerous sheets and towels had gone missing from the linen room of the Engemanm Student Health Center. The missing towels had allegedly been a problem for the past two weeks, but a bag with the missing items was discovered in a 5th floor stairwell.
Miscellaneous incidents
at 6:03 p.m. on March 24, DPS officers detained three suspects panhandling outside of the Von Kleinsmid Center. A check of their names revealed one of the suspects had an outstanding warrant. As a result, the suspect was arrested and she was transported to 77th Street Station for booking. The other suspects were released after being advised not to trespass again.
at 2:44 a.m. on March 25, DPS officers on patrol on Jefferson Boulevard and Budlong Avenue observed a juvenile loitering. He was cited for a curfew violation, and officers transported him to his place of residence and released him into the custody of his mother.
at 6:03 p.m. on March 25, a student reported a man walked up to her car when she was stopped at the bottom of the 10-Freeway and acted as though the student had hit him. The suspect subsequently photographed the student’s license plate and walked to the sidewalk. The student drove to a nearby gas station to call the police and when she returned to the scene the suspect was no longer there.

On Tuesday, USC World Vision ACT:S hosted an art exhibit and mattress vigil in the Ronald Tutor Center Grand Ballroom as part of Empathy Week, a weeklong campaign to raise awareness and advocacy against human trafficking.

The event was sponsored by the Undergraduate Student Government, and USC student organizations involved in the event included the USC Korean Campus Ministries, the United Nations Children’s Fund at USC, Student Coalition Against Labor Exploitation, Student Coalition for Asian Pacific Empowerment and USC’s United House of Prayer.
Volunteers from the organizations provided guided tours with a multimedia experience featuring film, photography and artifacts that served to connect students to the stories of real victims of child sex trafficking.
Volunteer Brandon Little said that the exhibit was launched in order to allow students to feel empathy for those involved in human trafficking.
“What we really want to strive for is that next level, which is empathy when you actually feel for someone, enter into their situation, and help find a solution,” Little said.
During a presentation during the exhibit, volunteers Natalie Zamudio and Jasmine Kellison shared the tragic stories of young girls in Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico and the United States. One table displayed the syphilis medication of a 13-year-old Mexican girl named Rita. Her vulnerability was exploited by pimps, who hooked Rita on drugs and forced her to turn to prostitution to satisfy her addiction. With the help of iEmpathize — an organization working to end child exploitation — and its supporters, however, she now lives in a recovery facility.
“By sharing these stories, we hope people will move from apathy to empathizing,” Kellison said. “We want them to step into these people’s shoes and realize that they don’t have to just sit back and let this happen.”
The exhibit also included a mattress vigil where participants could sit on a bed symbolizing places where children are exploited, and students were able to become advocates for the victims by taking their place on the bed. This exercise was free, but a $5 donation was suggested. one hundred percent of the proceeds went to the iEmpathize efforts in the United States and Mexico.
Guido Hajenius, branch coordinator for the NGO iEmpathize Los Angeles, was enthusiastic about engaging the USC community and advocating for awareness.
“The Empathy Exhibit is about empowering and giving students the tools to do more than just know about an issue,” Hajenius said. “We want them to share these stories and establish personal connections.”

Brian Polak, a third-year graduate student pursuing a Master of Fine Arts degree in dramatic writing, is well on his way to becoming one of the United States’ most acclaimed young playwrights.

Polak  was recently recognized for his written plays by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The aspiring writer entered two of his works — a full-length play and a short play — in the 2014 Kennedy Center American College Theater Festival. The festival, which will take place April 14-19 in D.C., is a national program involving 18,000 students from more than 600 academic institutions.
Polak’s full-length play, Henry and the Hippocampus, has already been awarded the festival’s Jean Kennedy Smith Playwriting Award for an outstanding                student-written script exploring the experience of living with disability.
The play, originally inspired by a National Public Radio story about a man who spent the last 50 years of his life unable to create new memories, tells the story of a man named Henry who has a similar affliction. The story follows the journey that Henry, his wife and his doctor take to try and rebuild his ability to form memories.
Polak said that writing the play was challenging due to Henry’s neurological state.
“When we watch plays or movies, we like to watch a character kind of go on a journey, change and become a different person,” Polak said. “But here we have this character who medically cannot do that.”
When Polak attends the festival in April, in addition to accepting his award, he will have the opportunity to see an excerpt of Henry and the Hippocampus performed.
Polak’s short play War Profits will also be performed at the festival. War Profits was loosely inspired by Bertolt Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children, and follows two U.S. soldiers in Iraq in 2007 who become disillusioned with the war they agreed to fight and decide to go AWOL.
“One of the themes that I’m exploring in several of my plays right now is my relationship to my country,” Polak said. “War isn’t what we see in the news every day. It’s much more complicated … so I decided to create these characters who, once the dirtiness and the scariness and the messiness was revealed to them, they were like, ‘I don’t like this, I can’t do this anymore.’”
Polak’s success as a playwright stemmed from his foray into theater shortly after receiving his B.A. in philosophy from Marymount University. When he was working full-time, Polak started to get involved in acting classes, improvisational comedy and traditional theater on the side.
“I’m not actually very good at acting,” Polak said. “It became my creative outlet, but I never felt comfortable doing it because it never felt right; something felt amiss.”
Once he realized this, Polak started searching for alternative creative outlets and he soon found himself writing.
“I didn’t really know what I was doing,” he said. “I just knew that I was doing plays as an actor, so why not try to write them?”
While still in the early stages of pursuing a writing career, Polak met his future wife who encouraged him to take writing more seriously.
“[My wife] was a writer, and all her friends were writers, and they were like serious, dedicated writers,” Polak said. “I learned [from her] what it really meant to be a writer … It’s a serious art form.”
Several years later, after Polak had spent time developing his craft, he and his wife moved to Los Angeles. Shortly after the move, Polak wanted to study playwriting in a formal academic setting.
“I never had anything I wanted to study before,” he said. “It took me many years to realize that there is this thing that I care about and I love, and it’s playwriting.”
During his time at USC, Polak has been free of the many distractions that would otherwise take him away from what he loves best: writing.
“[Being at USC] has helped me focus my attention on my writing in a way that I wouldn’t be able to do as the writer I was before I came to grad school, where I was writing in the morning and then going to work,” Polak said.
In addition to the time he has to work on his own writing, Polak says he also has time to engage with professors and other students who can offer him feedback and additional readings to fuel his growth as a writer.
“Writing gives me this closeness to the world,” Polak said. “My hope is that when I graduate I’ll be able to start living a life in the theater and presenting these plays publicly for an audience, with the hope that the audience will feel that same closeness to the world that I’m feeling writing.”
USC audiences can hear a reading of Henry and the Hippocampus presented at McClintock Theatre as part of the School of Dramatic Arts New Works Festival on May 28-31.

On Monday, Ainsley Carry, vice provost for Student Affairs, emailed the USC community detailing new initiatives that assist and support victims of sexual assault, as well as provide amnesty when reporting said sexual assault and medical emergencies.
Some of the new initiatives included additional residential assistant training regarding sexual misconduct, as well as improved procedures for the Department of Public Safety officers.
Deputy Chief David Carlisle said that the new improvements will focus more on the victim.
“When a sexual assault is reported, we do an initial assessment,” Carlisle said. “Once we determine it is sexual assault, we turn it over to the Los Angeles Police Department, but our involvement does not stop there. Our concern is for the victim. We become an advocate for the victim and we ensure the victim is made aware and referred to the various resources available on campus.”
Carry also noted the university had hired a professional investigator to look into occurrences of sexual assault.
“In September 2013, a highly trained sexual assault investigator was hired to have primary responsibility for investigating cases, following through with survivors, and continuously improving performance of the process,” Carry wrote in the email.
In addition to changes in reporting sexual assault, the Medical Amnesty/Good Samaritan Policy detailed that students will not be sanctioned for alcohol or drug use if they are reporting sexual misconduct.
“Those who report sexual misconduct or participate as witnesses in sexual misconduct investigations, or who seek medical assistance for themselves or another, by contacting a Residential Assistant, calling a Department of Public Safety officer, or calling 911, will not be subject to disciplinary sanctions for their consumption of alcohol and/or other substances,” Carry wrote in the email.
Fellow DPS Deputy Chief John Adams, who was a key figure in the development of the Medical Amnesty/Good Samaritan policy, explained the detailed provisions were already in effect.
“There is no change from what the practice has been,” Adams said. “The practice has been put in writing. The students from USC had come forward and said that they know DPS practices medical amnesty but there is nothing in writing that tells people what it actually is.”
Adams, stressed, however, that it is not a blank slate.
“The policy does not preclude disciplinary sanctions due to any other violations of student code of conduct beyond alcohol or substance consumption,” Adams said. “We can’t grant amnesty for everything.”
Kaya Masler, political director of the USC College Democrats, began advocating for a medical amnesty policy about a year ago when she realized that the university did not have one.
“It was one of the petition points I put on a larger scale of reform, asking the university to implement this,” Masler said. “The amnesty policy was a priority on that list because, in my opinion, it is one of the most important pieces of a sexual assault policy for student health and safety.”
Masler noted that the new Medical Amnesty/Good Samaritan Policy will encourage students to speak up without fear of being reprimanded.
“One of the primary reasons students don’t report sexual assault is that they think they are going to get in trouble for using alcohol or other substances,” Masler said. “That, to me, was a central indicator that we need Medical Amnesty.”
Logan Heley, Greek senator and former assistant director of campus affairs, also took part in developing the medical amnesty Policy. Like Masler, he noted that the new initiative will give students the assurance of not being punished for substance or alcohol abuse if they are reporting a sexual assault.
“This is one of our efforts for students to not be afraid to ask for help,” Heley said. “It is about keeping students safe. We want students to ask for help if they or their friends need it.”
USC garnered widespread media attention in May of last year when 16 students and alumni filed a Title IX complaint to the Office for Civil Rights within the Department of Education regarding the university’s treatment of sexual assault survivors and errors in its reporting and adjudication process.
Senior Alexa Schwartz, one of three students whose complaint is currently under investigation by the Office for Civil Rights, said that the administration has been meeting with students since the fall semester to talk about the aforementioned issues.
“We formed committees to work on each part of what is outlined in this letter,” Schwartz said. “For example, I worked on policy and process clarification to make sure that anyone that you go to on campus — whether it is an RA or DPS or a professor, we want to make sure that anyone employed by the university understands and has the tools to direct a student who is a victim of sexual assault.”
Schwartz also said these new initiatives will have a profound effect.
“I know these changes are going to make a big impact on our campus, and I hope that we’ll continue to get emails like this, reminding people of this information,” Schwartz said.
Junior Francesca Bessey, a member of the Student Coalition Against Rape and herself a rape survivor, found it heartening to see the issue broadly addressed for the first time.
“One of the central convictions I hold as an activist around issues of sexual violence is that progress has been severely stunted by a stubborn refusal on the part of society to bring this issue into public discourse,” Bessey said in an email.
Bessey stressed, however, that the new initiatives would not solve everything.
“A letter specifically discussing the issue and the steps being taken to address it challenges that troubling norm and I am grateful for it,” Bessey said the email. “However, the fact remains that USC is understaffed (both in terms of quantity and training) to deal with this issue. Changing this will come in part from changing the norm.”

Journalist Willow Bay was named the new director of the School of Journalism at the Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism on Wednesday morning.

Bay, who will start her position in July, brings in a wide range of experience. Currently the senior editor of the Huffington Post and a special correspondent for Bloomberg TV, Bay additionally has been an author, producer, digital news editor and national broadcast and global television news anchor.
“[Bay’s] prominent broadcast experience includes stints as co-anchor of ABC News’ Good Morning America/Sunday; co-anchor of CNN’s Moneyline News Hour; host, lead writer and producer of CNN’s long-form program Pinnacle; substitute anchor on NBC’s Early Today and other                                                       MSNBC/NBC programs; co-host of NBA Inside Stuff; and host, writer and executive producer of the Lifetime documentary Spotlight 25,” a press release released by USC stated.
Bay, who has never worked in an academic setting before, said her new position at the Annenberg School will allow her to influence a new wave of young journalists.
“I think Annenberg represents an extraordinary opportunity,” Bay said. “First, to educate and inspire a next generation of journalists, but also to bring into a world of practice, a new skill set and really new ways of covering stories that Annenberg students learn, and frankly that they are fluent in and well-versed in when they graduate.”
Bay’s position as director will begin right before the grand opening of Wallis Annenberg Hall, something she is excited about.
“It is a tremendous [occasion] for Annenberg to take an important role in a conversation, frankly a global conversation, about the future of journalism,” Bay said. “I think one of the key goals will be to settle in to the new Wallis Annenberg Hall and to fully leverage all of those technologies.”
Bay originally began working as a model when she was 15 years old, but said that journalism was always her true passion.
“I have always wanted to be a reporter ever since I was in high school, and that is actually, how I got into modeling,” Bay said. “I went for an internship at Seventeen Magazine. I started my career in a pursuit of a job in journalism!”
Wallis Annenberg, chairman, president and CEO of the Annenberg Foundation and USC Board of Trustees member, expressed immense pride in Bay’s appointment.
“I cannot think of a greater director for the USC Annenberg School of Journalism, or a greater model of what journalism can achieve in today’s world,” Annenberg said in the press release.
Bay’s work spans over a diverse array of the media landscape, and she noted that it’s exactly that diversity that will allow her to stand out as the new director.
“I have worked in so many sections of the industry, and it gives you a familiarity with the needs of those industries and I think that will help me hugely in Annenberg,” Bay said. “Hopefully, I can use that to the advantage, not just of the school, but of the students.”
Ernest Wilson III, dean of the Annenberg school, predicts that Bay’s leadership will usher the school into the future.
“We have a new building, a new program and a new era. I’m thrilled that Willow Bay will be here to provide new leadership for our School of Journalism,” Wilson said in the press release.

USC redshirt junior Haley Ishimatsu was named the Pac-12 Women’s Diver of the Year today at the annual Pac-12 Conference meeting. Voters for the award consisted of the conference’s diving coaches.
Dive in · Redshirt junior diver Haley Ishimatsu has won the Pac-12 and national championships in platform diving for two straight years. – William Ehart | Daily Trojan
Ishimatsu claimed her second consecutive national platform title at the NCAA Championships last week in Minneapolis after taking home the same crown for the second year in a row at the Pac-12 championships in Federal Way, Wash. at the beginning of the month. She also set a Pac-12 record and earned All-American honors in 1-meter diving. Ishimatsu now has three Pac-12 individual titles and two platform NCAA Championships.
The Seal Beach, Calif. native is a transfer from Duke, where she spent her freshman season in 2011. With the Blue Devils, Ishimatsu set an ACC platform diving record on her way to a conference title and All-ACC honors.
Ishimatsu battled injuries in the spring and summer of 2012, redshirting that season at USC, but still managed to qualify for the Summer Olympic Games by placing fourth in platform at the U.S. Olympic Trials. In 2013, her first season competing for the Women of Troy, Ishimatsu claimed the platform NCAA title by an incredible 68.15 points.
This season, Ishimatsu has set the pace for the Women of Troy in all three individual diving events: 1-meter, 3-meter and platform.
In January, Ishimatsu swept the platform events at the rival UCLA 2014 Bruin Diving Invite. She won the event with 650.45 points, dominating the field. Ishimatsu is the first woman to win the platform championship two years in a row since the ’92-’93 season, when Eileen Richetelli of Stanford  took home her second straight trophy.
Ishimatsu is taking after her sister, Victoria Ishimatsu, who claimed four consecutive Pac-12 Diver of the Year awards from 2009-2012.
The younger Ishimatsu still has a season left with USC to win even more championships for the team and USC’s head diving coach, Hongping Li.
Li also received the highest honor in the Pac-12 by being named the conference’s Diving Coach of the Year. This is Li’s sixth straight conference honor, and the 11th of his career. Since Li joined USC’s program in 1999, he has won eight NCAA championships between both men’s and women’s diving. The Beijing native was a two-time Olympian and a 12-time national champion for his home country.

USC’s women’s lacrosse team remains undefeated in early Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play after beating San Diego State Wednesday, 13-9. USC improved to 4-4 overall on the year as well as 2-0 in the MPSF. After suffering a loss at Massachusetts (9-1) last Saturday, USC got back to .500 with the win over the Aztecs.
Sharp shooter · Sophomore attacker Caroline De Lyra scored four goals and notched two assists in USC’s win over the Aztecs yesterday. The Brightwaters, N.Y. native has scored 11 goals on the season. – Ralf Cheung | Daily Trojan
Sophomore attacker Caroline de Lyra led the Women of Troy in scoring with four goals, while freshman midfielders Michaela Michael and Alex Moore and freshman attacker Annie Ruland all added two goals each.
USC more than doubled SDSU’s efforts in shots, putting 29 on target compared to the Aztecs’ 14. That forced SDSU’s goalie to make 13 saves, while USC sophomore goalie Liz Shaeffer only made two.
After eight scoreless minutes to open the game, SDSU got on the board first, but within 30 seconds USC senior midfielder Elizabeth Eddy scored for the Women of Troy. The teams traded goals until the score was locked at 3-3. The Women of Troy then surged ahead, scoring three straight goals to head into halftime with a 6-3 lead.
Coming out of halftime, the Aztecs closed the gap to a 6-5 deficit, but the Women of Troy responded with two goals to move ahead 8-5. The two teams scored back and forth again before USC scored four straight goals to move ahead, 13-7. The Aztecs scored the last two goals of the game, but it wasn’t enough to overcome the Women of Troy.
De Lyra’s offensive prowess was matched by SDSU’s Michaela Jarvis, who also put up four goals and an assist.
The Women of Troy embark on a stretch of five straight road games in conference play tomorrow at Fresno State (1-8, 0-4). After taking on the Bulldogs this weekend, USC will visit Saint Mary’s (0-5, 0-3) and Cal (2-5, 1-3) next weekend before  traveling  to Colorado the following week to take on Colorado (4-5, 1-1) and Denver (7-1, 2-0).
USC currently sits in a three-way tie with Denver and Stanford for the best record in MPSF play. Both USC’s preseason projection and current standings in conference play indicate that USC will make the MPSF tournament but need big upset wins to dethrone the top two teams in the conference. The Women of Troy also would not receive a bye in the quarterfinals of the MPSF tournament if they finished third in the conference standings.

On a recent exam in my sports business class, we were asked to answer only one question on the entire test: What would happen if student-athletes were paid? Though the actual prompt was a little more nuanced, that was the gist of it. My answer was — and is — that it would be logistically impossible to do so.
This anecdote is especially relevant in light of yesterday’s decision by the Chicago district of the National Labor Relations Board that college athletes could legally unionize.
Back in late January, a multitude of Northwestern football players, in conjunction with an organization called the College Athletes Players Association, filed to the NLRB to be formally recognized as members of a union.
Union members are, by definition, employees, and legally entitled to compensation. The NLRB found yesterday that student-athletes did in fact meet their definition of “employee.”
Naturally, Northwestern and the NCAA released statements saying that they are “disappointed” or “strongly disagree” or whatever — who actually cares? Northwestern has also said it plans to appeal the Chicago District’s decision to the NLRB’s national office in Washington, D.C., and, as you can imagine, whatever that office decides will simply be appealed to a federal court and it will be years before anything actually comes of this.
Still, this step should not go unnoticed. It is disappointing that student-athletes had to resort to legal action in the first place to obtain what are seemingly fundamental privileges of a scholarship. The compensation that Northwestern football players and the CAPA seek is not monetary, but rather better medical protection, funding for players to finish their education after their NCAA eligibility expires and scholarships that actually cover the full cost of attendance at a university. I support those requests wholeheartedly.
But there is a big difference between a full scholarship and actual monetary compensation for players. And the issue is that this opens Pandora’s box. I sincerely hope the CAPA succeeds in winning what it currently demands. But it’s only logical that after that comes actual salaries, and that I cannot endorse.
Imagine the potential ramifications of that. I’m not talking about the NCAA and its member schools having to restructure their business models and their budget, or the effects it might have on sponsorship or media. They can all deal.
I’m talking about the athletes themselves. Just who would get paid? Only those athletes on revenue-producing teams? That might seem logical, but imagine how that would work with Title IX (it wouldn’t). Is it fair to pay members of the football team more than the swim team? Seemingly so, but I doubt members of the swim team would think so. This would be an issue even within teams: Should the starting quarterback get paid more than the fourth-string tailback?
Would the payment differ by school? If it’s a percentage of revenue, say goodbye to parity in college athletics. Texas could probably pay a single player more than Cal’s entire roster combined.
As implausible as it sounds, payment of college athletes would actually spark more political and social debate than it does now. Schools would be faced with lawsuits until the end of time over “fair” compensation. It’s not difficult to imagine Congress getting involved at some point, as they did with steroids in baseball, and it’s even less difficult to imagine the issue ending up in the Supreme Court.
There is simply no limit to the ripple effects of paying college athletes. No matter how many bright minds you stuck together to figure out how it might work, they couldn’t cover even half of the bases.
What Northwestern and the CAPA are doing is, for the time, right. A full scholarship should be a full scholarship — it shouldn’t leave players hungry at night. But I do fear for what their quest could lead to: anarchy in college athletics.

At the time I saw this on TV, the network’s legal reporter commented that permitting unionization would apply only to private schools like Northwestern, USC, Stanford, Notre Dame and so on. This division, if it comes to that, would have unpredictable effects, presumably better for some schools and athletes, worse for others. We can only speculate now, but if you think about it, a number of different results will occur to you.
Author should know that, in the case of Northwestern players, a full scholarship didn’t leave the players “hungry at night” – read the full decision for details on their scholarship/living stipends, etc.

With just two weeks remaining in the regular season, the USC men’s volleyball team seems to have finally come into its own. After three big conference wins over spring break, the Trojans will head north this weekend to take on Stanford and Pacific for two more crucial Mountain Pacific Sports Federation matchups.
Digging deep · Senior outside hitter Henry Cassiday ranks second in the nation and first in the MPSF conference with 3.15 digs per set. – Nick Entin | Daily Trojan
“It feels good,” said USC head coach Bill Ferguson. “We’re definitely playing our best volleyball right now, and you always want to be peaking at the end of the year, and we’re starting to do that.”
The Trojans (14-8, 13-8 MPSF) beat crosstown rival UCLA (14-8, 11-7) in four sets on March 15. The team went on to beat Cal State Northridge (7-14, 6-12) last Friday in straight sets, then pulled out a four-set victory over Long Beach State (15-6, 12-6) the next day.
USC beat the Bruins by a score of 25-20, 19-25, 25-17, 25-23 at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion. Freshman outside hitter Lucas Yoder led the team with 20 kills, senior outside hitter Maddison McKibbin had 12 kills and senior opposite Tanner Jansen added 10 kills. The Trojans had previously fallen to UCLA in straight sets at home this year on Feb. 9, losing by a score of 25-20, 25-23, 25-19.
The Trojans avenged another sweep from earlier in the season against the Matadors. After losing at Cal State Northridge on Jan. 24 by a final score of 25-19, 25-21, 25-21, the Trojans earned a sweep of their own while hosting Cal State Northridge by a final score of 25-20, 25-20, 25-20. The trio of Jansen, Yoder and McKibbin led the team again in kills with 13, 11 and 8 respectively.
To complete the undefeated spring break campaign, the Trojans beat Long Beach State by a final score of 25-22, 21-25, 25-19, 27-25. Leading the team in kills again was Jansen with 26, followed by Yoder with 22 and McKibbin with 13. USC had beaten the 49ers in three sets by a score of 25-19, 25-22, 33-31 at Long Beach State on Jan. 22.
“We’re playing better every single game,” McKibbin said. “Our passing has gotten better, our hitting percentage is going up, we’re blocking a lot more balls, we’re getting a lot more aces. It feels like we’re steadily reaching our peak, which is what we planned to do.”
Both the Cal State Northridge and Long Beach State home games were played in the North Gym, rather than the usual Galen Center, as the Galen Center was booked that weekend for the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards. The North Gym, located inside of the Physical Education Building in the heart of campus, was the team’s home court when the program first became a varsity sport in 1970 until 1988. The North Gym and the Lyon Center split time as the team’s home court between 1988 and 2006 before the Galen Center became the official home court of the team in 2007. The North Gym can only hold about 1,000 spectators, about a tenth of the capacity of the Galen Center, and was the home court for the team three of the four seasons USC has ever won a national championship.
“I love playing in North Gym,” said senior libero Henry Cassiday. “I don’t think I’ve ever lost here. It’s a gnarly home court advantage with the low ceiling, and we practiced with that a little before. We have our fans here and they’re really close, they’re right next to the action, so it’s really fun.”
The three-game winning streak featured the same starting lineup for the Trojans each match. Along with McKibbin and Yoder starting at the two outside hitter spots and with Jansen starting at opposite, the USC starting lineup has featured freshman Andy Benesh at the first middle blocker spot, junior Chris Lischke at the second middle blocker spot, Cassiday starting at libero and junior Micah Christenson as the starting setter. With relatively few exceptions, Cassiday, Christenson, Yoder and Benesh have started every game for the Trojans this year, though the team has used more of a committee for the second outside hitter spot, second middle blocker spot and the opposite. Cassiday, however, said that the group of seven starters from the last three games has developed a lot of chemistry together and look to be the starters for the rest of the season.
The Trojans take on Stanford (14-7, 11-7) today and will spend the night in northern California before taking on Pacific (2-19, 1-15) Friday. The Trojans fell to Stanford at home on March 9 in straight sets by a score of 25-15, 25-14, 25-22 but swept Pacific by a score of 25-20, 25-22, 25-15 at home on March 7.
The Trojans are ranked as the No. 7 team in the country, according to the most recent American Volleyball Coaches Association poll, with Stanford coming in at No. 6 and Pacific unranked. The Trojans are currently in fifth place out of 13 teams in the MPSF, 4.5 games behind BYU, who leads the conference at 16-2.
Both matches this week are set to start at 7 p.m. If USC can win both, the team will have won five straight matches for the first time this season.

After 36 holes of play at the SDSU Farms Invitational in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., the No. 1 USC women’s golf team trailed crosstown rival No. 2 UCLA by eight strokes. With much to prove heading into yesterday’s final 18 holes, the Women of Troy gave it their all, winning the tournament by three strokes. Leading after two rounds, the Bruins posted a team score of 5-over par allowing the Women of Troy to claim the title with a 3-under 861 final score.

Freshman Karen Chung continued her stretch of impressive play for USC, shooting a 7-under 29 on the front nine yesterday. She began with a two-shot eagle on the par 4 first hole, followed by five birdies over the next eight holes. Junior Doris Chen had the second-best effort for the Women of Troy on the final day with a 2-under 70, trailing Chung by 4 who finished with a 6-under 66.
Clearly, the Women of Troy figured out how to correct their mistakes made during Monday’s first round. After just 18 holes, the USC women’s golf team trailed the Bruins by 13 strokes. USC head coach Andrea Gaston remained calm, however, and said she knew that her team had plenty of golf left to play over the remaining 36 holes.
“We were very surprised by our performance yesterday,” Gaston said on Tuesday. “We made some unfortunate course management mistakes that cost us a lot of shots. Today we made more birdies and played the par 5’s a lot better than yesterday.”
Though Gaston was pleased with her team’s second round comeback, yesterday’s third round effort was arguably even more impressive. With its 6-under score, USC was the only school to record a team score under par on the day, as No. 9 Stanford and No. 2 UCLA recorded 1-over par and 5-over par third rounds, respectively.
Both Stanford and UCLA finished in a tie for second place at even-par for the tournament, and fellow Pac-12 rival No. 4 Arizona State finished in fourth. Though the Sun Devils ensured that Pac-12 teams claimed the top four spots, the real competition in this tournament only involved the Women of Troy, the Bruins  and the Cardinal. Though only three strokes separated USC from the two second place finishers, the Sun Devils finished in fourth place at 17-over par, 14 strokes behind the Bruins and Cardinal.
Yesterday’s win is USC’s seventh in eight attempts this season and ties the school season record set last year, with many tournaments still to come. As defending national champions they are officially on a roll, winning both of their tournaments this month. The Women of Troy have just one week before they battle the nation’s best at the Liz Murphy Invitational in Athens, Ga. The winning formula for USC combines a tight knit group of golfers playing well as a team, as well as the potential for individual competitors to make a difference in any round of any tournament.

In our current tech-savvy, gadget-driven age, there has never been a more important time to learn how to build and create groundbreaking innovations. USC Mechanical Engineering alum Melissa Jawaharlal held a similar sentiment when she launched a campaign earlier this month to raise money and support for Pi Bot — a uniquely designed, affordable, complete robotics kit for anyone interested in building and programming robots, according to her Kickstarter.
“What happens today is any students in 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th grade or older, who are interested in learning about robotics or programming, simply does not have any kit out there that they can get excited about,” Jawaharlal said. “We’ve put together a complete robot kit that allows students of all ages and backgrounds to get introduced to robotics, at an introductory level and also for hobbyists.”
Jawaharlal began working in K-12 educational outreach when she and her sister, Lavanya, who is a student at University of California, Berkeley, founded STEM Center USA in 2011, a creative center that provides students with hands-on opportunities to get involved in science, technology, engineering and math.
“The way it works is we have after-school programs and we have kids coming into our center once a week to practice their creativity,” Jawaharlal said. “It is amazing. They come in for an hour and a half, they program and they have a blast. We use all sorts of cool stuff to develop our curriculum … We came up with the project in conjunction with our work with the kids.”
One of the criticisms of the engineering field today is that men largely outnumber women — something noted by companies such as GoldieBlox, which aims to provide construction toys for young girls as seen in their gone-viral commercials — and Jawaharlal said she agrees with such claims.
“Absolutely there’s a gap — anyone who tells you otherwise is straight-up lying,” Jawaharlal said. “USC is very fortunate in having over 30 percent women in the engineering field in education. That being said, if you look at fields like mechanical engineering countrywide, that’s typically less than 5 percent women. I currently work at Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems — I’m one of the few women out there. In the classrooms that I teach robotics in, already in elementary school, girls are typically averse to math and sciences fields because that’s a boy’s field, or that’s something that only nerdy guys do. There is a major gap and that is something that is very near and dear to my heart as a woman in engineering.”
And though some robotics kits do exist in the market today, Jawaharlal said they are either too expensive or aren’t properly conducive to the learning experience.
“There’s a lot of really great programs out there, but a lot of them have students working in teams of 10 or more,” Jawaharlal said. “One of the issues that I see with that is that students don’t get to touch everything. So in a project with 10 students that has a cool robot, you might only be doing mechanical or only doing programming, but that’s not a way to get a taste of everything, so that you can figure out what kind of career you want.”
Jawaharlal said that her background at USC helped her with this campaign, providing a system of support and encouragement to follow her passion. In addition to starting the STEM Center, Jawaharlal worked as a resident adviser and at the Information Sciences Institute, a research institute affiliated with Viterbi. She said that being involved with these organizations influenced her to take on the role of a mentor for younger students.
“USC has been so supportive in everything I’ve done,” Jawaharlal said. “[At the Informational Sciences Institute], I had professors supporting me, I had organizations supporting me and everyone drilled me to pursue what I was excited about. I had a lot of really great mentors and people who were instrumental in keeping me in that field and keeping me excited about what I do. One of my missions was using that mentorship and providing that for more students. I’ve been working in outreach and volunteering activities pretty much all my life, and as I got more and more excited about engineering, I wanted to make sure I shared that.”
Despite having little to no experience in professional fundraising, Jawaharlal’s online campaign has 624 backers with more than $55,000 pledged at the time of publication. With a goal of $70,000 and just 13 days to go, the campaign is in its final stretch.
“We went to Kickstarter … because we hoped we would be able to get a certain amount of publicity, reach people who exactly were interested in our products, as well as just jump right into manufacturing,” Jawaharlal said. “[It] allows you to reach out directly to your customers right away — our customers being parents, educators and students who are interested on their own.”
The demographic make-up of these customers, however, did take Jawaharlal by surprise.
“We anticipated a lot of parents and educators initially, but we’ve seen a lot of retirees, people who are leaving the industry now and they’re 60, 70 years old,” Jawaharlal said.
But no matter who is backing the venture, Jawaharlal said that she couldn’t be more appreciative of the support she has received.
“These people are people who believe in you, people who want to see you succeed, people who love your ideas,” Jawaharlal said. “Six hundred and twenty people worldwide — we have interest from all over the world — are excited about what you’re doing.”
And though Pi Bot might seem like a tool used exclusively by engineering majors or those with extensive experience in the field, Jawaharlal said she wanted to emphasize that the project is more about making this type of technology available to all students, at all levels.
“We don’t expect every single one of the students that we work with to become engineers one day, but the idea that they should have the confidence and interest, should they think that that is a career for them, is huge,” Jawaharlal said.

It’s been a decade since Mel Gibson’s bloody, polarizing The Passion of the Christ became an unlikely box office phenomenon, grossing more than $600 million worldwide and igniting a holy firestorm of controversy and theological debate, and Hollywood is still trying to replicate its success, especially its ability to appeal directly to Christian viewers.
Perfect storm · Noah, played by Russell Crowe, and his family struggle to survive an apocalyptic deluge — and each other — in director Darren Aronofsky’s new, bold biblical epic Noah, due on Friday. – Photo courtesy of Fox News
In their zeal to capture the hearts and wallets of the faithful, studios such as 20th Century Fox and Paramount seem poised to unleash a second coming of grand-scale religious filmmaking, the kind not seen since the 1950s heyday of Cecil B. DeMille’s The Ten Commandments and William Wyler’s version of Ben-Hur. 2014’s release calendar is already stacked to the rafters with biblical adaptations and other devout epics, many of them commanding the Goliath-sized budgets typically reserved for the latest superhero sequel.
February saw the release of Son of God, a bland, listless dramatization of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ that cobbled together new and used footage from the History Channel’s The Bible. The channel’s hit miniseries, which averaged a staggering 11.4 million viewers during its five-week run last March, received well-founded criticism for featuring a Satan who bore more than a passing resemblance to President Barack Obama.
Despite poor reviews — the film currently holds a 22 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes — Son of God did well in theaters, debuting just behind Liam Neeson’s hijacking thriller Non-Stop and eventually earning a respectable $55 million. Like The Passion of the Christ, the film received the blessing of conservative leaders — including evangelical pastor Rick Warren — and was marketed specifically to churches and other Christian organizations in an effort to promote the film as separate from other Hollywood offerings (never mind that it was distributed by 20th Century Fox).
Director Ridley Scott, who previously examined the physical and spiritual toll of the Crusades in the supremely underrated Kingdom of Heaven, is currently hard at work putting the finishing touches on Exodus, a retelling of the liberation of the Israelites starring Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul, Joel Edgerton and Academy Award winner Christian Bale as Moses. The film, scheduled for release this December, hopes to attract both Christian and Jewish audiences, emphasizing commonalities between the two faiths and presenting the story as a timeless parable of courage and sacrifice.
In terms of narrative scope, technical ambition and sheer audacity, however, no other film in 2014’s religious roster represents a riskier bet than Darren Aronofsky’s Noah, which has already been banned in three predominantly Muslim countries, and is expected to be banned in three more that don’t allow the portrayal of prophets. Aronofsky, the director of The Wrestler and Requiem for a Dream, is one of the most original and uncompromising voices in an industry increasingly beset by meddling studio executives and by-committee screenplays. The critical and commercial success of his 2010 psychosexual ballerina thriller Black Swan prompted Paramount to green-light the filmmaker’s first prospective blockbuster: a tale of human clemency, divine justice and survivor’s guilt very loosely inspired by one of the most well-known stories in the Old Testament.
Despite being an avowed atheist, Aronofsky has long been fascinated with the character of Noah as a tormented prophet who must abandon the rest of humanity, not to mention the inherently unsettling idea of God giving his creation a hard reboot in the form of a genocidal, world-drowning flood. In order to find financial backing for the project, Aronofsky and his co-screenwriter Ari Handel collaborated with Canadian artist Niko Henrichon to create a graphic novel based on their script. The first volume of the work, titled Noah: For the Cruelty of Men, was released in October 2011. Soon after its publication, Paramount gave the go-ahead for the big screen version, including its eyebrow-raising $130 million budget.
Aronofsky approached Christian Bale and Michael Fassbender about playing the title role before finally settling on Crowe, whose gruff regality seems like an ideal fit for this darker, morally burdened version of Noah. The rest of the cast is equally impressive, especially Jennifer Connelly as Noah’s wife Naameh, Perks of Being a Wallflower co-stars Logan Lerman and Emma Watson as his son Ham and daughter-in-law Ila, respectively, and the always-welcome Cockney character actor Ray Winstone as Tubal-cain, the boastful king of men who goes from scoffing at Noah’s warnings to raising an army to take the ark by force after the storm begins. The gravel-throated Nick Nolte also appears as a fallen angel named Samyaza, the leader of a group called the Watchers that represents the extensive creative license Aronofsky is rumored to have taken with the story.
Relations between Aronofsky and Paramount are reportedly strained after a series of post-production shenanigans involving the studio’s fixation with courting Christian viewers. After early test screenings with religious audiences produced feedback that was decidedly less than rapturous, Paramount re-edited the film into several alternate cuts without Aronofsky’s knowledge or consent. When the director found out, he was understandably furious. According to the studio, however, the version of Noah we’re getting in theaters is Aronofsky’s final cut.
Some viewers are bound to take offense at adaptations that take liberties with holy source material, but the idea of talented filmmakers such as Aronofsky and Scott putting their authorial stamps on some of the most durable stories ever told is too exciting to be left at the humorless mercy of biblical literalists. In fact, this might be a case where not going by the book is the best course of action. To borrow a phrase from J.R.R. Tolkien, the stories that endure the longest are those that grow in the telling.

The National, one of the most popular and critically acclaimed indie-rock groups making music today, rocked the Shrine Auditorium Tuesday.
Design by Ethan Rechtschaffen
The National didn’t just put on a typical rock concert. The National’s live performance was preceded by the first L.A. screening of Mistaken for Strangers, a documentary about the group directed by Tom Berninger, the brother of The National’s frontman, Matt Berninger.
What might have seemed like an exercise in ego became one of the most important aspects of the evening and completely changed the dynamic of the night.
Mistaken for Strangers, in reality, is not a documentary about The National. It’s a documentary about how two brothers struggle to reconcile the financial and critical successes of one versus the relatively unsuccessful financial and critical life of the other.
It is a documentary made by a brother who loves heavy metal and hates indie-rock, who makes amateur horror movies about cannibals with identity crises,  and who manages to become as much a part of the night as his brother and the band.
Mistaken for Strangers is unlike most other music documentaries. Shot on a hand-held camcorder, Tom Berninger attempts to make a documentary reminiscent of home movies. The documentary begins with Tom’s attempts at interviewing Matt Berninger, asking inane questions until Matt Berninger impatiently interrupts him and asks whether he had any sort of plan for filming the movie.
It becomes clear that Tom Berninger’s film began without any sort of initial planning. The finished product, however, provides a humorous and uncomfortably familiar experience for anyone who has had to deal with family tension.
Though the classic narrative dynamic of “successful sibling versus less successful sibling” might seem forced at times, what makes this documentary so fascinating is its beginning without any understanding of what kind of direction it would head in.
For each moment that might seem overly cinematic, the audience is later reminded that what they are seeing is reality in how the relationship between the Berninger brothers plays out.
The narrative progression might seem overplayed, but when the viewer considers that this was a documentary made without any initial sense of direction, and that it came close to being abandoned multiple times, it becomes even more fascinating to see the kind of storyline that emerged out of the hundreds of hours of tape.
The film has its humorous and somber moments, oftentimes moving between the two within a matter of seconds. This is where Mistaken for Strangers really draws its authenticity, and not just from the DIY aesthetic of the shots.
Not only are there shots of Matt Berninger’s temper, but the film captures some uncomfortably tense moments between the brothers. The honesty in portraying the tensions that bloom out of having a sibling considered more successful than the other gives Mistaken for Strangers an edge over other music documentaries, endearing both brothers to the audience.
More cynical fans might say that the documentary was just one big public relations stunt,  set less on endearing fans and more on displaying their ego.
The night, however, was emblematic of what film and music can do together to blur the line between audience and performer.
After the film, The National took the stage for a live set. As the band roared through song after song, each one feeling like the band’s biggest hit based off the audience’s reactions, one began to wonder whether Tom Berninger would make another appearance.
Before getting fired from his filmmaking role halfway through the film, Tom Berninger had been hired as a roadie for The National’s tour in addition to his documentary purposes. Some might say it’s impossible to make one of the most well-known indie bands in the world and a room of 6,000 people feel like a family. But that’s exactly what happened at the end of the night.
As Matt Berninger crowd-surfed his way through the audience during the second-to-last song of their set, something different happened. The grins, cheers and pats on the shoulder weren’t just directed toward one person, but two.
Matt Berninger was the subject of adoration, but right behind him was his brother, keeping the microphone cable above the heads of the spectators. And he was cheered on and encouraged by the crowd, with people thumping his back and attempting to hug him.
As the song finished, both brothers embraced in the crowd, and the sheer joy felt in the room could only have been made possible by the personal connection that Mistaken For Strangers established for the audience.
Tom Berninger’s documentary was premiered at exactly the right time and location. For fans of The National, seeing the documentary right before a live set with both brothers working together was a poignant reminder of why the audience loved the group.
Though it’s not always possible to be presented publicly, the common experiences of frustration, disappointment and humiliation shared between the musicians and the members of the audience are what keep people listening.
It is these experiences, in fact, that The National bases its music on and why people continue to buy its records.
At least for a night, The National succeeded in breaking through the wall between a musical group and its fans that usually puts musicians on a personally distant pedestal. As members of the band filed on the stage for the live performance, the atmosphere of the room had moved beyond that of a group and its adoring fans to one that felt like a family.
And as fans filed out of the Shrine Auditorium at the end of the night with satisfied grins on their faces, 6,000 Angelenos could all say they felt like one big family.

Beginning in fall 2014, students attending private, nonprofit universities in California will see a drastic cut in their financial aid, specifically in the amount they receive in Cal Grants. Cal Grants, which help pay for tuition and other university expenses, are set to be cut by 11 percent as California continues to battle budgetary issues, according to the Los Angeles Times. Such budget cuts made at the expense of students’ education are yet another reminder that the era of draconian cuts and politicization of education needs to end.
Alan Hung | Daily Trojan
 
The cuts in education funding offer a disturbing image of the current narrative facing not only California, but the entire country. When faced with budgetary and economic woes, education is the first expense to be cut. In 2011, the maximum award was $9,708. Currently it is $9,054. With the additional cuts, the maximum award will total $8,056, the lowest in 16 years. The benefits of making small cuts in funds that aid students attending college are very narrow for the state, but the impact on students is almost immeasurable. With today’s astronomical costs of education, it is increasingly important for students to find money wherever they can. Investing in students and education is an investment in the future. Cutting aid puts the burden on students to find funding elsewhere or drop out of school completely.
Budgetary issues in California are as old as the state itself. When faced with a deficit, cuts are made to balance the budget. Rarely, however, are they made fairly and across the board. Sacred cows such as Social Security, Medi-Cal and Medicare are almost never touched, whereas education is usually the first on the chopping block.
Though Cal Grants have been cut over the past three years , newly instated University of California President Janet Napolitano was given a generous six-figure salary totaling $570,000, plus $8,916 and $9,950 bonuses for car and mortgage payments, respectively. The UC system, funded by the state, even remodeled and renovated a home for the former Secretary of Homeland Security costing between $3.5 and $6 million, all under the guise of reducing maintenance costs in the future. An initial $620,000 was approved to begin the renovations. Napolitano was also given $142,500 for relocation costs.
The California legislature  also condemns that the coffers are nearly empty, and the current funding for higher education is unsustainable. The UC system in the past decade has struggled to keep classes open and provide students with reduced tuition and sufficient financial aid. Private institutions, such as USC, have launched optimistic and record-breaking fundraisers in order to stay afloat and provide an infrastructure for students and faculty that will endure in the 21st century. Higher education is suffering; meanwhile, the UC system is spoiling its new president, who was brought in to lead one of the largest systems of higher education in the country in the right direction. To add insult to injury, Gov. Jerry Brown was approved for a salary raise last summer, increasing his pay to $173,987 per year.
The bureaucracy in California has hindered the development and progress of universities and in lieu of slashing pay and benefits for themselves, lawmakers and those in power have shifted the burden to students and parents. With Napolitano making six figures, the $8,916 per month bonus she receives for car payments nearly totals more than the maximum award for Cal Grants next year. That money could be used to invest in a student’s education.
With the current trajectory of California’s budget for higher education, the future looks bleak at best. The issue is systemic as well. The Common Core, a curriculum instituted across much of the United States that standardizes K-12 education, is harshly criticized for its lack of depth and rigor. The newly announced SAT has made the essay optional and has simplified its vocabulary. Not only are students receiving an underfunded education, but if they reach the next level in college, they are faced with staying afloat both academically and financially.
California needs to invest in higher education and eliminate the bureaucracy in favor of giving the students of today an opportunity to succeed in the future. Maybe in the next round of budget negotiations, the legislature will agree to turn Napolitano’s vacation expenses into scholarships and grants for university students trying to get an education.

The state of California spent 1.5 billion on Cal grants for the 2012-2013 school year. I doubt cutting the UC president’s salary is going to make much of a difference. Take a look at other university’s presidents and you will find they are making by far more than the current UC president. She voluntarily took a pay cut that set her salary at a third of what President Nikias makes.
It’s unfortunate that the Cal Grants were cut – but let’s look at the real problem, and not blame 1 person’s salary. We should not be spending any government funds on for-profit institutions. These online schools such as Bridgepoint and Phoenix are making HUGE amounts of money which comes out of our tax dollars. They scheme and trick people into attending by employing salesmen as their “financial aid counselors”, leaving students with a poor education and massive debt. On top of that, they get funding from Cal Grants, though less than non-profit universities. They should not be receiving a penny from the government. Many students will receive loans and Cal Grants only to not finish their degree because of the horrible institutions that these for-profit schools are.
Write a story on that.
How can you slight the commitment of California to education? We presently spend princely funds on education. Not only does 40% of the CA budget go to education, the people attending are asked to kick in money. On top of that the alumni are regularly solicited for funds. Each school has its own endowments to bring in more income. Schools regularly sell rights to advertise to students and alumni to bring in more money. Businesses also partner with schools to provide even more money. A slip in the Cal Grants budget is not a lack of commitment to education. 
In the end, it is the student that pays the price for education, whether it is in dollars or time. The more a student pays, the more the student will value the education. Increasing the Cal Grants to remove the financial responsibility for education from students will change their attitude and many of them will place less value on the education. Everything you get for free is worth what you pay for it.

On March 18, a group of Taiwanese students organized a protest against the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement with China. The CSSTA, dubbed a “black box” agreement by the opposition, will allow Chinese companies to have greater influence on the Taiwanese economy. Students and small business owners fear this will threaten job security and make the island dependent on Chinese investments.
Though student protesters’ main objection is the CSSTA, their protests address a much larger issue: The Sunflower Movement, the name of the campaign, calls for open communication between  the government and the Taiwanese people. These peaceful protests are an essential element to democracy; they draw attention to injustices and help ensure government officials address citizens’ needs.
In addition to fostering economic bonds, dissidents fear that increasing China’s presence in Taiwan will threaten their civil rights and undermine their hard-won independence.
“For now, [we] can express [ourselves] freely, but many fear for their right to free speech without censorship should Beijing exert dominance on them,” Benedict Young wrote on the activist blog Stories Worth Seeing.
Young highlights the strong connection between economics and politics. If China gains an economic stronghold in Taiwan, it could enforce its censorship policies in the country. The Council on Foreign Relations reports that Chinese media outlets are routinely monitored and modified. On a more global scale, Google and China had a public confrontation on Internet censorship.
Freedom of speech and freedom of press are essential to democracy — without these basic rights, citizens cannot voice their opinions and participate in their government. Currently, protesters are drawing on international connections and utilizing social media to spread their message. When governments limit citizens’ freedom of expression, they cut off essential channels of communication and move toward the dark path of totalitarianism.
Peaceful protest is a key aspect of democracy. It calls attention to injustices and encourages civic participation. Similar to the United States’ Occupy Wall Street movement, the Sunflower Movement demonstrates that young people have a greater awareness of economic injustices.
Both movements hint at the growing concern over economic issues. For example, the Daily Australian found that millennials are more concerned with the economy than with environmental issues. This fiscal focus makes sense; if a country is not economically stable, it cannot address other issues, such as the preservation and conservation of land. The International Monetary Fund newsletter found that global economic uncertainty puts young people at risk, and that the global economic crisis “threatens to spawn a ‘lost generation’ that may find it hard to recover,” implying that economic issues have a far-reaching impact on young people.
Though Taiwanese students encounter governmental opposition and struggle to gain media attention on the island, they are still able to influence the government by drawing international scrutiny. Citizen-based crowd-funding enables Taiwanese protesters to purchase local media attention and reach out through international campaigns. For example, Fight for Democracy, a group of Taiwanese students in the United Kingdom, uses Facebook and online media to organize international rallies in support of the Sunflower Movement. One such rally will take place in Los Angeles on Sunday, March 30 at the Wilshire Federal Building. International protests show support and put pressure on government officials to address citizens’ concerns.
In order for democracy to function as it should, the government must be responsive to their constituents. When policy fails to address the needs of citizens, peaceful rallies and protests draw attention to injustices and put pressure on government officials. With the help of the media, grassroots tactics bring these issues to light. Making concerns known is the first step to combating injustice. As U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis said, “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”

Ms. An selectively missed certain facts in her opinion.  She conveniently didn’t mention the students occupy the government building.  The students all came from southern Taiwan, a stronghold for DPP.
Students occupation of Taiwanese government building is anti-democracy process.    It should not tolerated anywhere else in the world.   Without legal foundation, any demonstration represents worst of mob rule.
Just the fact that Ms. An wrote about this should be applauded, as most people in America probably have no idea this is going on but it’s an incredibly important issue. For a college sophomore, this is an impressive subject to tackle. 
Under normal circumstances, a lot of people might think occupying a legislative building is extreme, but such as extreme step isn’t done without a reason to back it up. No one would sacrifice so much time out of their personal life to occupy the building if they didn’t passionately believe their government was operating contrary to the best interest of the country and without transparency. It’s not a strategy that should be used often, but in this case clearly people feel justified.
It should be noted there are also plenty of people in the north who disagree with the trade deal and even if several people came from the south they’re still Taiwan citizens who are concerned about the trajectory of their country so I don’t really see why geography makes them any less entitled to political opinion.
“The students all came from southern Taiwan” is misinformation. Please disregard. The participants are from all over Taiwan, and many of them from Taipei, which is often regarded as the “stronghold” of the KMT.
This is a movement by the people, not by any specific party. I hope those who believes it’s driven by any particular party will do their own homework and look into the past nine months since the agreement was secretly and rapidly signed, in China, not in Taiwan, and see that demands and questions by the public were ignored, which is the fuel of this protest.

When former U.S. President Jimmy Carter exchanges private correspondence, he goes to the post office. In an interview with Meet the Press, the 89-year-old statesman said it isn’t because he can’t use email, but because he is afraid his communications will be read by the National Security Agency.
Grace Wang | Daily Trojan
 
The admission by a former leader of the free world is an eyebrow-raiser. Two weeks ago, I wrote about how the complaint alleged by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that the CIA had snooped on staffers lacked credibility because Congress, especially Feinstein, continued to support various NSA programs that spy on millions of Americans. Apparently, Congress agreed.
In a near complete reversal this week, leaders from both parties proposed overhauls to the way the NSA does business, as the deadline to reauthorize existing NSA programs is set to expire on Friday. A CNN article quoted a senior administration official who said President Barack Obama will seek a temporary extension that will expire upon the passage of Congressional reform legislation.
The reports also come on the heels of President Obama’s call in January to scale back the way the NSA does business, after former security contractor and NSA leaker Edward Snowden released a plethora of documents last year that revealed the extent of post-Sept. 11 surveillance.
If the reform passes, it will demonstrate just how effective Snowden was in getting the government to pay attention to itself — for all the accusations, the information Snowden provided in the Hong Kong Mira Hotel to The Guardian and The Washington Post is finally having an impact. This victory, however, will be more symbolic than substantive — the particulars of both plans make mere dents in an apparatus that has been constructed for almost a century. The New York Review of Books described the establishment of the first Black Chamber in 1920, built in downtown New York City to monitor telegrams both leaving and entering the country.
Ninety-four years later, what do both plans actually do?
CNN reported that the first plan, proposed by the White House, seeks to eliminate government control of “metadata,” which are records of the times and phone numbers involved in phone calls, but not the body of the calls themselves. The CNN article also quoted a senior administration official who said the plan “still ensures that the government has access to the information it needs.”
This is unpromising.
They realized they couldn’t complain about CIA oversight of the Senate without shedding light on their own practices.
Along the same lines, the House version of NSA reform, proposed by Mike Rogers (R-MI), and Dutch Ruppersberger (R-MD) limits the currently automatic collection of such metadata by requiring court approval for the program as a whole and for the specific phone numbers in question.
Would a system like this actually work? It’s been done before, and the results were a sham — the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, set up in 1978 to constrain government spying with judicial approval, created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to administer such warrants. What most people do know is that the Bush administration’s warrantless wiretapping program after 9/11 effaced any Constitutional protections that FISC established.
What most people don’t know is that between 1978 and 2001, there were 34,000 applications brought before the FISA court. Only 11 were rejected. There is no indication this won’t happen again, under the guise of judicial protection.
But what if we forget, for a moment, that the court would likely rubberstamp thousands of requests to tap phones? Even then, serious doubts remain. A Washington Post article summarized an NSA internal audit (leaked by Snowden) that found that between April 2011 and March 2012, rules or court orders for conducting sanctions were violated 2,776 times — or seven times every day. What Snowden revealed was that though the FISA rules required the government to receive FISA court permission to place Americans on target lists, they were able to bypass those regulations by just replacing names with phone numbers and email addresses.
The reforms are a step in the right direction, but broader institutional concerns mean a deep cleanse is necessary. Consider just two words from the testimony of James Clapper, director of National Intelligence, which took place before the Senate Select Intelligence Committee on March 12, 2013, just two months before Snowden’s devastating revelations. The question asked was from Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.): “What I wanted to see is if you could give me a yes or no answer to the question, ‘Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?’ ”
Clapper’s response: “No, sir.”
If I were Jimmy Carter, I would still use the mail, too.

Once a hyper-local blend of music and dance native to the South and West sides of Chicago, footwork is gaining traction in the world of electronic music with the help of artists who are bringing it into the mainstream.
Footwork artists, like DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn, are characterized by their rhythmic dexterity and sample-based mayhem that usually hums along at 160 beats per minute.
Although this hyper-local scene has been active since the mid-90’s, the past few years have witnessed a heightened global interest in footwork’s unique, otherworldly aesthetic. UK label Planet Mu has released two survey compilations under the name Bangs & Works that have been well-received by the dance music cognoscenti, and these days Rashad and Spinn (real names Rashad Harden and Morris Harper) are international footwork ambassadors, playing to enthusiastic crowds in Moscow, Switzerland, and Romania.
First-time footwork listeners might be bewildered by the unapologetic strangeness and menace that characterizes the sound. Although this is technically electronic dance music, most footwork tracks are diametrically opposed to the fist-pumping euphoria you’d find on the main stage at HARD or Ultra. R.P. Boo’s (Kavain Space) career-spanning album Legacy, a 57-minute long masterclass from one of the genre’s principal pioneers, offers a comprehensive look at just what footwork has to offer. One notable song, “187 Homicide,” samples Justin Timberlake’s classic “Cry Me a River” to a nauseating effect.

Taking its name from the section of California’s penal code that defines the crime of murder, “187 Homicide” works as an aural strangulation, offering a warning to any aspiring producers who might challenge Boo’s claim to supremacy.
Countless footwork tracks thrive on this cutthroat arrogance, but the myriad of references to murder and bloodletting aren’t intended to fuel the notorious gang violence that still plagues Chicago. Instead, footwork’s savage sentiment inspires a healthy competitive spirit between rival dance crews, who battle for dominance in rec centers and warehouses around the city.
“This is how we dealt with our struggle…it’s what kept us out of trouble,” said crew leader Lite Bulb, who often joins Rashad and Spinn on stage, in an interview with Thump. “We’re all friends at the end of the day. But in battle, I’m fitting to win. There’s no possible way you can even think that you’re gonna win.”
But Rashad and Spinn have differentiated themselves from peers by branching out from established footwork templates. Their most recent material draws heavily from other genres to create tracks with accessible hooks and unprecedented emotional depth.
“We all take elements from other music,” Spinn said in a 2011 Red Bull Music Academy lecture. “With juke and footwork I feel there’s no boundaries. We can touch on any aspect of music, from jazz to soul, rock to classical, and just throw some bass behind that sh-t, for real.”
Rashad’s Double Cup LP, released last, is the latest proof of this concept, fusing footwork’s restless energy to elements of soul, acid house, and G-funk. The hazy West Coast vibes are immediate on opener “Feelin,” a breathtaking rework of Roy Ayers’ “Brand New Feeling.”
Although Rashad & Spinn’s current output may not be well-suited for battle circles, the more accessible fare has been highly successful in club environments around the world. While opening for Chance the Rapper on his recent Social Experiment Tour, the duo dropped a number of contemporary hip-hop favorites in addition to their own material. One of their best tricks involves throwing a juke beat behind a top 40 favorite, as they did with “Mercy.”

“Good music is good music,” Rashad said in an interview with Dubspot. “You gotta play whatever makes the crowd happy. That’s how I was taught to be a DJ.”
DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn will headline the sixth annual KXSC Fest on Sat., March 29, in E.F. Hutton Park.
