Expectations for the upcoming season have been high all summer at USC McDonald’s Swim Stadium.
Now, the No. 9 women’s swimming and diving team has a chance to validate the hype in its opener today against Oregon State. And the team is looking to make a statement.
Diving in ·Although it is the first meet of the season, the women’s swimming team has high expectations for its meet this weekend against Oregon State. “I expect us to throw down some significant times,” coach Dave Salo said. - Daily Trojan file photo
“I expect us to throw down some significant times,” said USC coach Dave Salo. “We want to send a message that we’re one of the top-five teams in the country.”
Fresh off an encouraging seventh-place finish at last season’s NCAA Championships, the Women of Troy field an enviable mix of accomplished returning swimmers and new talent.  Six All-Americans are back for another season, including senior captains Presley Bard and Lyndsay DePaul.  USC also boasts a star-studded freshmen class led by breaststroke standout Kasey Carlson.
“Kasey will help us tremendously in our relay performances,” Salo said.  “She should replace Rebecca Soni in the breaststroke.”
Salo is not alone in expecting big things from his freshmen. DePaul said the new additions have fit right in.
“Our freshmen are amazing,” DePaul said. “Right from the start they’ve had an attitude to work hard and kick butt.”
First up for the Women of Troy is Oregon State, which finished seventh at the Pac-10 Championships last season.
“Oregon State is not one of the strongest teams [we’ll face],” Salo said. “[But] the Beavers always have a couple of good swimmers.”
The opponent might not be imposing, but USC is certainly not discounting the Beavers.  DePaul said the team set a goal to win every dual meet, regardless of the opponent.  This weekend is just another step toward achieving that goal.
“Our standards are really high,” Bard said. “We want to finish in the top four [nationally], and we’re all really confident we can do that.”
According to Salo, today’s meet will be a good opportunity to evaluate where his team is at in its training. Most of the swimmers will compete in one of their primary events and several of their weaker events.
“It’s good timing for us to have a competition as we prepare for Arizona and Arizona State in November,” he said.
Action kicks off at noon at the USC McDonald’s Swim Stadium. UC Davis, which was initially scheduled to take part in the meet, pulled out of the competition. Because the Beavers do not have any divers, USC will only compete in swimming.
“We’re excited to get out there and compete,” Bard said. “Hopefully this meet will let other universities around the country know that USC is back.”

For every film of transcendent profundity, there are 10 that are transcendent only in their stunning awfulness. Generally, these films should be ignored, but sometimes a film breaks away from the pack and is decidedly enjoyable despite its inadequacies.
These are my five favorite bad films.
5.  The Girl Next Door (2004)
If a film came out with a cast that featured Emile Hirsh, Paul Dano, Timothy Olyphant, Jack Baur’s daughter (Elisha Cuthbert) and Dexter’s father (James Remar), you’d be stoked too, right?
Of course you would, and this fallen connoisseur of good taste wouldn’t blame you a bit if you enjoyed this raunchy, cynical teenage sex comedy.
Treated with indifference by both audiences and critics upon its release, The Girl Next Door failed to do the one thing that got it the green light in the first place: capitalize on the American Pie phenomenon. But it failed so beautifully.
4. Deep Blue Sea (1999)
One day an alien civilization will look down upon the shattered ruins of human kind scattered about the earth and come to the inevitable conclusion that basic cable marked the beginning of the end.
Yes, basic cable is the guilty culprit here. If not for those twin pillars of excellence — TBS and TNT — my impressionable teenage mind would never have stumbled upon this cinematic aboration of a thriller and cheap Jaws knockoff, but then again it would be my loss.
There is nothing fancy about Deep Blue Sea. It’s an action thriller about genetically mutated sharks munching on people, and for about of two hours it does exactly what it sets out to do.
3. Patch Adams (1998)
Ah, moving from a film about people getting eaten by sharks to a film starring an actor whom I wish would be eaten by sharks. What a lovely transition.
In Patch Adams we have the Robin Williams reprising his favorite role: an inspired and eclectic idiot savant determined to think outside the box (see Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society). This time, Williams is a doctor who objects to the cold, calculating approach — most sane people take to medicine because as we all know, medicine should be fun.
Patch Adams is a classic ’90s dramedy, a film that tries to blend the depressing with the comedic, to ill effect. The same film that features a strung-out Robin Williams bouncing off the walls of a top medical school also features retrospectives on murder, suicide and the flawed nature of man; so, beware of tonal shifts. But that is what makes the film so entertaining. You get roped into this seemingly lighthearted comedy, and then it goes, “Nope, we’re now dealing with issues way beyond our maturity level.”
Thank god for the ’90s. You gotta love ’em.
2. Showgirls (1995)
With such cinematic masterpieces as Showgirls, Basic Instinct and Starship Troopers, Paul Verhoeven really deserves his own place in the pantheon of cinematic dung peddlers, right next to Martin Scorsese and Kevin Smith. He gives Dutch cinema a bad name, an important note as I am Dutch myself.
No matter. Verhoeven might be bad, but at least he’s entertainingly bad, and that’s the point of this column — to celebrate those films that crashed upon the rocks of good taste, yet entertained us as they did so.
I fear, however, that Showgirls might overstep the bounds of this column. It’s a bad film, to be sure. But Verhoeven’s ability to blend two contradicting genres — sexploitation and musical — make Showgirls delightfully intriguing.
What few people now realize is that this crude little story about a wandering nomad trying to make good in Las Vegas was an international phenomenon — one of the first films to be a financial success even though it failed in the box office. The combination of sex, drugs, Las Vegas and the NC-17 rating created a web of intrigue about the film, one that the home-viewing bloc bought into.
Of course, this is all a fancy way of saying that Showgirls was the first mainstream smut film to reach the perv audience en masse. But don’t blame Verhoeven. Blame VHS.
1. Meet the Feebles (1989)
I don’t care what anyone says. This Peter Jackson puppet epic is an example of raunchy comedy par excellence.
Made at the very beginning of his career, on a comically thin budget, Meet the Feebles is Jackson’s MGM musical parody that makes the creators of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut look like blushing brides. It tells the story of the Feebles theater troupe that is appearing on live television in the hopes of becoming a syndicated show.
Of course, when a troupe of Jim Henson-inspired puppets take the stage, little is expected to go right. But it’s how terribly things go wrong that makes Feebles so inspiringly bad.
Without delving too deeply into the sordid details, Feebles features a climactic shootout sequence shot using live ammunition (Jackson couldn’t afford blanks), a Kermit the Frog-inspired character strung out on heroin reminiscing about Vietnam, and so much else that it makes my head spin.
In all honesty, I can’t adequately describe the disturbed brilliance encapsulated by this film. As awful as it is, it at least goes down in a blaze of fascinating glory. You can’t take your eyes off it. You want to, but you can’t.
And that, dear reader, is the definition of an entertainingly bad film.

Last Wednesday, among the cool smell of clay and shelves of various clay creations, Susan Rawcliffe made a special appearance at USC to expand the budding artists’ minds about ceramics and wind instruments.
Rawcliffe, a recipient of multiple grants for art, explained that her passion lies in anything and everything dealing with wind instruments — researching, making, performing, lecturing and exhibiting.
Bringing her expertise to students, she exposed them to the unfamiliar world and dynamic personality of clay wind instruments.
“I want to teach kids about making sound in clay,” Rawcliffe said. “I want them to know that it’s fun and that you can play with it — different shapes make different sounds.”
The students present at her lecture are part of a new class on the USC campus that merges two seemingly unrelated schools and creates a brand-new experience.
Sound Art (FA 499) is a joint project between the Roski School of Fine Arts and the Thornton School of Music. Thornton faculty member Veronika Krausas teamed up with Karen Koblitz, ceramics area head in Roski, to create the idea behind this unique interdisciplinary course and the lecture series Rawcliffe was a part of.
In previous weeks, the class included appearances from John Schneider, Thornton faculty member Kenneth J. Lopez, and CalArts faculty member and composer Arthur Jarvinen.
But the project goes beyond the appearances of these speakers.
“[We want] to give [the students] a wide perspective of different kinds of non-traditional instruments and instrument makers with the goal of them building their own instruments and the musicians composing for and performing on the instruments, culminating in a concert of the instruments and works,” Krausas said.
The class will not only organize a concert at the end of the semester but will also record its compositions and venture into the surrounding community to perform in art galleries.
“Both Veronika and myself came up with a list of guest speakers for the Sound Art course that would give students information for creating a series of handmade instruments,” Koblitz said. “We wrote a proposal for a USC Funding for Innovative Undergraduate Teaching Grant, which we were awarded, and allowed us to have the funding to go forward with this course.”
The course is particularly unique in that it presents students with the opportunity to see how exhilarating and satisfying making and playing their own instruments can be, a point that Rawcliffe stressed.
From mere blocks of clay, the students were able to create aesthetically interesting wind instruments from which they could create a variety of tones. Rawcliffe demonstrated throughout the lecture how even the simple use of her hands helped create a rhythmic and clear sound from the clay shapes the students formed.
Rawcliffe’s second lecture started with the making of small pinch pots — students took orange-brown clay and formed it into two round shapes. They then put pressure on the top, creating an indentation. Starting from the bottom up, the sculptor pinches the creation in a circular motion — thus the name pinch pots — to create a miniature bowl. Students were told to create pinch pots that would fit with each other.
Up next the sculptors took a simple tube of the same clay open on both ends and used a small knife to insert a hole in it. Afterward, they made the holes deeper and then blew into them to produce a stream of surprisingly loud sound. Students experimented with covering one side or another, carving out more, and blowing at different angles and with different gusts of their own wind. The room soon filled with failed attempts and rough sounds as well as high and low pitches blending with the smiles and excited sounds of the students.
Rawcliffe supervised the making of the instruments and amazed the students by creating high- and low-pitched noises reminiscent of a jungle-like sound.
After the pinch pots dried, the students put them together and created a hole at the top, making yet another unique and surprisingly simple wind instrument.
This is just what Rawcliffe wanted.
The initiative brought together students artists but was also open to the public. Krausas hopes to offer the course every second year and therefore spread the interest in making instruments to more of the student body.
“This is the first time at USC this course has been offered in collaboration with both art and music students,” Koblitz said.
And perhaps the course will pave the way for even more relationships between the various schools on the USC campus.
Correction: 10/17/10 — A previous version of this story misspelled Veronika Krausas’ last name. This entry has been corrected to reflect the changes. The Daily Trojan regrets the error.
