Since the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, people throughout the nation have banded together in their collective frustration of the Trump administration. Millions armed with clever signage and standing shoulder-to-shoulder  have taken to the streets to march and rally in an effort to ensure that fundamental rights and liberties are protected.
Campuses nationwide have channeled this spirit, playing host to student demonstrations. USC is not absent from this phenomenon, finding its activist voice after historically sitting on the sidelines in comparison to its institutional counterparts.
Yet, in light of the findings in the Daily Trojan’s Spring 2017 supplement on Tuesday, it is clear that there is one movement that has lost momentum: activism against sexual assault. But it shouldn’t be this way, as activism to prevent sexual assault and expand campus resources works concurrently with the larger social issues that students are already demonstrating against.

And despite the University’s effort to “chase zero” sexual assaults, it is clear that much work remains. On April 1, a sexual assault was reported at Fluor Tower. As the alleged perpetrator, Armaan Premjee, awaits trial, students should be reminded that the fight to end sexual assault on campus requires a more nuanced, dedicated fight.
In 2013, campus advocates identified the necessary conversation the 2013 federal Title IX investigation created among students. That seed planted by campus advocates was instrumental to the administration’s response. Since the start of the investigation, USC has adopted education programs, established online portals on the topic, assembled task forces and created dialogue between students.
That should have been just the seed. Instead, according to Vice President of Student Affairs Ainsley Carry, sexual assault activism has stalled in the years since the investigation started. Student interest has waned, and conversation has withered.
“I want to get back to the days when students were banging down my door saying, ‘Let’s do something to end sexual misconduct on our campus’ — I miss it,” Carry said. “I really want students to get fired up about this again. I don’t want this to become, ‘Oh, that was important in 2013’ — until we get to zero, this is still important.”
In order to get back to that vitality, we must expand our understanding of campus sexual assault and what needs to be done. Our supplement spotlighted areas in which the University still needs to make strides.
To receive a forensic exam, victims of sexual assault are directed to the Santa Monica Rape Treatment Center, which, while providing extensive and world-class trauma care, is 45 minutes away — simply too far for many survivors. The Daily Trojan spoke to students exploring the feasibility of bringing rape evidence collection kits to campus. It’s an effort that all members of the USC community should look into — though the treatment center’s precision and expertise cannot be replicated, the distance between USC and Santa Monica does act as a deterrent. Students must advocate for a treatment center that  is geographically closer and enables survivors to care for themselves with as much ease as possible.
Annother issue is that student-athletes are six times more likely to commit sexual assault than other students at the University. Violence is endemic to sports culture. As students attending a university with an elite sports program, we have a responsibility to have the difficult conversations to remove attitudes of entitlement and hold our student-athletes accountable, despite their celebrity. And this includes making sure that after convicted athletes are expelled from this institution, justice continues to be served.
Other barriers for survivors arise when students feel uneasy with the Title IX process. Responses to Title IX cases may take longer than the 60 days that the federal government recommends as the length of a typical investigation. The Title IX office needs more staff and resources to ensure that investigators are able to dedicate the appropriate time and energy to each case. And since understaffing impedes the offices from closing a case in the recommended amount of time, a prolonged investigation may prohibit a survivor from moving on from their trauma.
Students should be fighting for these changes. It is admirable — but not enough — that students now undergo consent training when they matriculate to USC. We are all aware that sexual assault happens on all college campuses, USC included. But we are not all aware that the sexual assault response system at USC still needs marked improvement.
When the Daily Trojan titled its Spring 2017 supplement “Chasing Zero,” we meant it. We should not settle for a culture that allows sexual assault in any form. We want students to galvanize around this issue — to advocate for better resources and to change the toxic and predatory culture that still robs young Trojans of their agency. And we want to see them chase zero — to organize, to fight, to make greater efforts to expose and understand the complex issues surrounding sexual assault on a college campus, until USC’s reporting rates reach zero.
Daily Trojan Spring 2017 Editorial Board
Here’s some more nuance for everyone who cares about sexual assault: due process.
We want justice for victims, that we all agree on. We also (should?) all agree on justice for the accused.
Some folks ruin others’ lives with their genitals. Others do it with their mouths and keyboards.
We need to approach each case with an open mind. The one who complains that So and so raped her could well be telling the truth. On the other hand, So and so could be telling the truth if he says he didn’t.
And sometimes even both sides are being sincere. The complainant may legitimately believe that she made it clear she wasn’t consenting, even when the respondent legitimately believed she was consenting — so she may not be a liar and he may not be a rapist.
On the institutional level, we need fair procedures to handle complaints of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment. Like the historic right of confronting one’s accuser — especially in cases like these, commonly “he said she said” cases where credibility is everything. Needless to say, all sides would need to be restrained from abusing cross-examination to personally attack complainants, respondents, witnesses or anyone else. Any well-trained judicial administrator or hearing panel chair should be able to manage that as well as any other part of the college judicial process.
Also, for those offenses likely to result in suspension of expulsion — as sexual assault and rape certainly should — the standard of proof could be clear and convincing evidence. It still falls short of beyond a reasonable doubt, but allows for enough certainty to be able to kick someone out of school — and, especially these days, likely destroy his (or her) school and career dreams.
Those found responsible should be able to appeal, to make sure the school is making the right choice. However, we should not have double jeopardy — a second trial for an acquitted accused. Re-trying acquitted defendants is a time-honored method of abusing due process rights, which is why double jeopardy in the courts is unconstitutional.
Finally, in cases where we not only find the defendant not responsible but also can prove the accuser was lying (as opposed to legitimately mistaken, see above), we should punish false accusers. Provided, of course, that they, too, are only found responsible given the same due process protections that those accused of rape and other offenses enjoy.
Deterring and punishing rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment, while making sure we punish as few innocent people as possible, is a tough balance to strike. It’s certainly not quite as emotionally satisfying, nor does it “prove” your virtue quite as well, as an all-out anti-rape crusade. 
On the other hand, it does help avoid hurting a whole new set of victims. Which is what social justice is supposed to be about.

Last Saturday, President Donald Trump took to Twitter to write out this proclamation: “Next Saturday night I will be holding a BIG rally in Pennsylvania. Look forward to it!”
Never mind the grammatical hurdle at the end of the tweet (Is he looking forward to it? Telling us to look forward to it?), Trump’s decision to hold a rally on Saturday is significant for three reasons: the date falls, not coincidentally, on the same evening as the White House Correspondents’ Dinner (in which journalists, actors and politicians convene for a night of jolly banter), on Trump’s 100th day in office and also on the potential first day of the government shutdown if an appropriations bill does not pass by Friday at midnight.
It would be one thing if, during the Correspondents’ Dinner, Trump stayed silent. It would be one thing if he watched from the quiet of his White House living quarters, wandered through the building in a bathrobe or even hunkered down on Twitter with his thumbs at the ready. But, instead, what does the leader of the free world choose to do? He chooses to travel to Pennsylvania to speak at a rally — to guarantee that the roasting in Washington will be silenced by the roaring of his own voice in another direction. And he chooses to draw others into tuning the Capitol out.
Admittedly, the crowds that will gather for his rally probably would not have tuned in to the Correspondents’ Dinner anyway. And just as students should not have to be told to listen to prejudiced speakers on their college campuses, Trump owes it to nobody to attend the Correspondents’ Dinner. But then again, we’re talking about the president of the United States, and we’re talking about actions that can be projected, in their symbolism, across a national conscience.
Yes, the president is using a tactic many learned to abandon in middle school — which is that talking over people you disagree with puts the immaturity spotlight on yourself. But even still, this bad behavior drives far beyond the standard of eye-rolling. The Correspondents’ Dinner is a tradition more than a century old. In just one week, our government may be actually closed down. It is a stunningly ignorant stance that Trump cannot even stand to be in the same room as those he knows will criticize him.
Indeed, we are living under a president who will take to Twitter to dangle the threat of cutting federal funds over the University of California, Berkeley’s decision to keep far-right personality Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking on campus for his own safety, and then subsequently cross state borders to keep away from the media figures sure to roast him at the Correspondents’ Dinner.
His decision to do so casts long shadows over the Oval Office, because if Trump disregards anything, it is respect and integrity for the role of the presidency. Tradition, dignity — none of it matters to him. Only the worship, the throngs waving posters and cheering his name. That is what he wants to hear, and because he is the president, we will be forced to pay for it.
If Trump chooses to ignore the criticism and instead would rather praise himself in front of thousands, if he would rather present on the outside a shiny, flawless gold exterior — then maybe the world will begin to believe the greatness he sees in himself. Maybe someone will.
Furthermore, this choice mirrors the behavior of someone even younger: a toddler, crouching in the middle of the school play yard, holding his hands over his ears and screaming at the top of his lungs. Pretending that as long as he can’t see and hear — his teacher, his parents, his friends — then no one else can. Pretending that if he ignores the damage his leadership at the top of the executive branch has wreaked over the past 100 days, then everyone else will, too.
I, personally, am looking forward to the strongest and most scathing White House Correspondents’ Dinner in recent history. May Trump’s absence fuel the rhetoric even more, because on this day when the government threatens to shut down and our fearless leader turns his back, may there be no one who will let him forget the weight of his country trailing behind him. May there be no holding back.
Zoe Cheng is a sophomore majoring in writing for screen and television. Her column, “Cross Section,” ran every other Tuesday.
Zoe Cheng’s premise here is remarkably hypocritical.  Was she outraged at the opposition protesters who marched (and rioted) during Trump’s inauguration?  Is she outraged when protesters rally, march and riot outside political summits like the G8 ?  Probably not.
“It is a stunningly ignorant stance that Trump cannot even stand to be in the same room as those he knows will criticize him.”
“Furthermore, this choice mirrors the behavior of someone even younger: a
 toddler, crouching in the middle of the school play yard, holding his
hands over his ears and screaming at the top of his lungs. Pretending
that as long as he can’t see and hear — his teacher, his parents, his
friends — then no one else can.”
Are we talking about Trump or the Berkeley students?
Quit confusing Zoe with facts.  That hardly seems fair given her IQ.
Zoe, please transfer to UCBerkeley.
You’ll be much happier there with more evening activities to invigorate you and get your mind off the real world.
To Zoe: Don’t mourn the WHCD too much. No less a journalist than Glen
Greenwald has publicly wished for its demise. See below for a bit more on why he
(and I) feel that way.
To Thekatman: I’d buy you a beer if I were
 in the same city as you. I’m not a fan of Trump, but if his absence
permanently deflates the WHCD, it can only be good for the country. This
 nauseatingly chummy dinner has always highlighted for me how many
members of the press egregiously misinterpret what are supposed to be their
adversarial roles as outsiders. 
Thankfully, after sleeping
through most of the Obama years, the would-be Woodwards and Bernsteins
in a lot of big newsrooms are finally waking up and doing their jobs
(which they should have been doing all along instead of trying to be friends with the White House). 
Hopefully the newly present
market pressure from voices like Breitbart and the IJR will keep those newly vigilant journalists from going back to sleep when a Democrat eventually
returns to the oval office. Maybe the slow withering of this dinner will help. I won’t hold my breath.
It’s called problem avoidance.  It is quite common and mature for parents to teach their children such precepts for life.
Your leftist fueled hatred of President Trump is only surpassed by your inability to think clearly and freely for yourself, Zoe.  No one has forced students to listen to a guest speaker at a campus event. Milo was silenced by the rioting and destructive behavior of Antifa and BNTN thugs.  They are the 2017 version of the Brown Shirts of Nazi Germany.  If you and your circle of friends want to align yourself with them, fine, that’s your choice, but chastising Trump for not attending the WHCD,  which will not be pleasant for anyone other than the anti Trump media and Hollywood A-listers, why should he be there? It will not be a friendly event, as you have already noted.  Man, you kids are so misguided these days, and your university experiences are not getting you ready for the real world, but you have 2 more years to grow up.
Good luck. Fight On, Trump.

White tents lined McCarthy Quad, Childs Way, Trousdale Parkway and various other locations on campus over the weekend. The two-day Los Angeles Times Festival of Books drew over 10,000 locals and visitors as they gathered to listen to authors, artists and scholars present their work.
Sponsored by major companies such as Acura, Kind, 5-Hour Energy and C-Span, the festival had an early start on Friday with 37th annual Los Angeles Times Book Prizes in Bovard Auditorium hosted by stand-up comedian Tig Notaro. Book winners included Secondhand Time: the Last of the Soviets for “Current Interest,” Imagine Me Gone for “Fiction” and The Nix for “Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction,” among other winners and honorable mentions. The Trojan Marching Band officially kicked off Saturday festivities with an opening performance.
Some notable speakers included celebrity chef Ayesha Curry, retired basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, author Margaret Atwood, author Michael Connelly, author Viet Thanh Nguyen and California Institute of Technology professor Sean Carroll, among others.
Booths of books · The vendors at the festival not only sold books, but also offered memorabilia and a variety of arts and crafts activities for children. There were also featured panels that discussed topics from travel to TV shows – Jenny Chung | Daily Trojan
Panels were held in nine different locations and went from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturday and from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Following author panels were book signings for the audience to get a few moments of facetime with the author of their choice. In addition, local bookstores and organizations also set up shop in booths lining student pathways, advertising everything from books and stationery to meditation CDs and nonprofit goals.
This year, as a way to advertise for Hulu’s newest TV series adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s novel The Handmaid’s Tale, actors in handmaid costumes walked among the festival visitors. These actors wore long, red dresses and white bonnets, passing out temporary tattoos with the saying “Don’t let the bastards grind you down,” which is repeated throughout Atwood’s novel.
Journalist Mary McNamara moderated the panel with Atwood, and TV producer Bruce Miller discussed their collaboration over the Hulu series as well as differences between the book and the TV series. Discussing filming choices, Miller talked about the symbolism of the head bonnets and their ability to hide emotional expression as well as give off an air of mystery and conservatism.
Atwood described her choices in writing the novel: Notably, her choice of sartorial requirements for her characters reflected each color’s symbolism in the Bible (blue represented the Virgin Mary, whereas red represented Mary Magdalene). They gave important insight on some deeper meanings and motifs presented in both the novel and the series.
USC professors also had their own time in the spotlight at the Festival of Books. Viet Thanh Nguyen, a professor in American studies and ethnicity, held a conversation with author and critic Laila Lalami about their respective books. Attendees crowded in the hallways of Seeley G. Mudd to hear Nguyen discuss his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, The Sympathizer. Josh Kun, a professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, engaged in a four-person panel about non-fiction and the establishment of Angeleno culture.
Visitors of all ages were able to participate in the Festival of Books, with various booths and even a children’s stage dedicated to engaging young readers. Participants also had the opportunity to engage in Festival After Dark, a series of activities that take place after festival hours. This year’s programming included Spring Awakening, a student production hosted by USC School of Dramatic Arts, as well as Book Drop Bash, a book swap hosted by the Library Foundation of Los Angeles.
Beyond booths and vendors, various musical acts also performed on stage, including several USC students. Artists painted murals near Wallis Annenberg Hall, Bai and KIND handed out free beverages and snacks and the Keck School of Medicine gave free health screenings. Visitors were welcomed by a courtyard full of food trucks in the parking lot behind Grace Ford Salvatori Hall, and first-timers and veterans alike were greeted by a bustle of activity that permeated throughout the USC campus.

We made it. And when I say “we,” I mean it. I couldn’t have done it without you. I really didn’t know what to expect when I signed on to write this column. I love running, of course, but there are plenty of things I love that I cannot put into 700 words every week. I usually write features and profiles for that very reason; it’s difficult to write about something you love. That’s why my sorry excuse of an essay for the New York Times’ Modern Love column will remain buried deep within a forgotten folder on my computer.
This column is different, though. I didn’t write an ode to running for myself. I wrote it for you. Perhaps you’re bored of running or perhaps you’ve never really given it a fair shot. Perhaps you needed a little extra encouragement from a friend. I wanted to be the friend that could set you up so that you can fall in love with running the same way I did.
It wasn’t always easy to explain the things I wrote about. Love and running are both so irrational that it was hard to capture them on paper. Anyone who has ever been in love understands. The little reasons you fall in love never seem to fully add up to why you feel so strongly.
This column was a semester-long challenge to find the little reasons, and I hope at least one meant something to you. It gave me a whole new approach to running, like my own version of 50 First Dates. Every single time I went on a run, I was looking for a new thing to love — wthe shorts tan, the community, the burn in my legs after five miles. It was amazing how many I noticed once I kept my eyes open for them. So yes, it was you who made every time I laced up my shoes feel like the first time.
We’ve been through a lot together. Maybe you remember my struggle to find time to run during spring break or how I got sick the day before my half marathon. You were there when I had to admit to myself that I may not ever be fast enough to qualify for Boston, but you were also there when I broke my personal record. There’s ups and downs in every relationship, and running is no exception. What matters is every Tuesday, you were there, and I have to thank you for keeping me accountable.
You told me how impressed you were that I could come up with something to write about every week. Even though it was hard sometimes, I feel the same way now as I do at the end of the race. I could do it all over again right now. Because right now with you feels really good. Whether you made it to the end of a 5K or simply the end of the semester, you should be very proud of yourself, too. There’s no accomplishment too small. We make a good team.
From here on out, the rest is on you. I’ve done my part. For this to work out, you need to put in the effort. The weather is getting nicer. If you have a few minutes, grab your running shoes and get outside. Go somewhere together. Get to know each other a little better. I can almost guarantee that it’ll make your heart race.

Mayor Eric Garcetti declared Tuesday a holiday in the city of Los Angeles to celebrate the Academy Award-winning film La La Land. In conjunction with the DVD release of the movie, which includes many scenes of iconic locations in the city, Garcetti will commemorate with festivities on the steps of City Hall Tuesday.
The ceremony will begin at 8 a.m., with a kickoff performance from a local jazz band. Those in attendance have the opportunity to break out their dance moves, as well as at the very end of the ceremony when the band will play again.
In between performances from the jazz band BANDALOOP, an aerial performance group that focuses on vertical dancing, will show their skills. Performers will be strapped into a bungee cord apparatus and hang from wires in front of City Hall, where they will perform dance routines on the side of Los Angeles City Hall.
Based in Oakland, Calif., the group holds open auditions so that individuals with a dance background and interest in vertical dance can learn and eventually perform. For the showcase on Tuesday, the group will perform a medley inspired by the dance numbers featured in La La Land, according to the Los Angeles Times.
The ceremony will also feature a host of guest cameos. While the film’s stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone have not said whether they will attend, director Damien Chazelle will be at the festivities along with composer Justin Hurwitz. Also in attendance will be production designers David and Sandy Wasco and choreographer Mandy Moore. Jewelry designer Kyle Chan is also expected to attend, after his shop was featured prominently as a backdrop in the film.
There are plenty of other ways to celebrate La La Land Day without actually being at the official festivities. Southern California residents can tour various filming locations. Because the DVD and Blu-Ray versions will be released on the same day, fans can also sit back and enjoy the film in the comfort of their own home. They can also find a local jazz club in Los Angeles, among many other activities and attractions that protagonists Mia and Sebastian visited.
La La Land Day is only the beginning of La La Land-themed tributes that will stretch well into the summer. Hermosa Pier is installing La La Land-styled lights on April 30 to recreate the iconic film scene with Sebastian singing on the pier. Local parks are releasing their schedules for free viewings of films including  La La Land. Organized tours of film locations are being planned out in future for those who want to explore where the film was shot in a group. On May 26 and 27, La La Land In Concert will take place at the Hollywood Bowl, where Justin Hurwitz will conduct a live orchestra during the screening of the movie.
Since its release in late 2016, La La Land has become an icon of Los Angeles culture and a celebration of the city. La La Land Day is only one tribute to the film’s importance as a symbol for the city, and it is a must-go for lovers of old Hollywood and Angeleno culture.

As he sits in baseball offices named for his great-grandfather Herbert — adjacent to the field his older brother played on just four years ago — sophomore slugger Lars Nootbaar insists that his path to USC was not based on family.
“My grandpa and grandma came here, and my older brother [Nigel] played baseball here,” Nootbaar said. “But for me, that doesn’t really mean much. They just so happened to go to the same school as me.”
For Nootbaar, his goal has always been to carve his own path outside of his lofty family name. After all, he originally wanted to be a big-time college quarterback, not a USC baseball player like his brother. At El Segundo High School, Nootbaar was a dual-threat talent who threw for over 2,000 yards in both of his final seasons. But when he didn’t receive the same caliber of scholarship offers for football as he did for baseball, Nootbaar chose the school and sport his family is inextricably tied to.
“After playing high school football through my junior and senior year, I built a lot of good relationships,” Nootbaar said. “It was very tough [giving up football], but being able to play baseball here is another dream come true.”
While the standout baseball player is grateful to suit up on the diamond rather than the gridiron, the quietly self-assured Nootbaar believes he would be a successful quarterback in the Pac-12 — though he stopped short of saying he could have led USC to a Rose Bowl win like friend and fellow sophomore standout Sam Darnold.
“I’m definitely confident in my ability, but probably not [at Darnold’s level] if I’m being real,” Nootbaar said about his prowess with the pigskin.
Considering Nootbaar’s play so far this season, it’s hard to question his decision to focus fully on baseball. He’s currently hitting .317, leading the Trojans in RBIs (25) and home runs (5).
Fans have become accustomed to seeing Nootbaar produce big hits in clutch situations. Against Long Beach State in February, he launched a two-run homer in the eighth inning to tie the game and ultimately lead his team to an extra-inning victory. On an even bigger stage in March versus UCLA at Dodger Stadium, Nootbaar’s 10th-inning RBI double ended the Bruins’ hopes for a victory.
Nootbaar chalks up his penchant for game-breaking plays to both confidence and repetition.
“I would say it’s definitely both mental and physical,” Nootbaar said. “I envision having success in those certain situations, but confidence is a big thing that I’ve gained over the past year. Last year as a freshman, sometimes I would go up there and try to do too much, and this year it’s just knowing that I’ll get the job done.”
In many ways, it’s difficult to compare Nootbaar’s freshman season to his performances this spring. Last year, he was a young prospect in a lineup filled with experienced standouts such as Jeremy Martinez and David Oppenheim. Nootbaar started 29 games but only showed flashes of what was to come in his sophomore campaign, finishing the season hitting .238 with just one homer. But with this year’s roster losing 12 players to the 2016 MLB Draft, Nootbaar has been forced into a leading role, one that he has proven to be suited for.
But contrasted with Nootbaar’s rapid rise, his team has been slumping. The Trojans currently hold a 18-20 record, having lost 12 of their last 15 games, most recently suffering a sweep to Cal on the road last weekend.
“We’re a young team,” Nootbaar said. “But it almost works in our favor because sometimes we don’t even know what we’re doing out there. Sometimes, when we’re hot, we don’t really know what we’re doing so we just ride with it. But other times, when we’re cold, it’s tough for us to get out of there because we don’t have that experience to know how to pull the team together.”
While this season has seen its fair share of inconsistency and shortcomings, the team’s lack of success has done little to dampen Nootbaar’s ambitions for USC, the most decorated program in college baseball history with 12 national championships.
As he sits in the Herbert V. Nootbaar Baseball Office, Lars Nootbaar asserts that it was not his family’s legacy that brought him to USC. And perhaps he is telling the truth. Perhaps he had to go to the place where his family had already made their mark in order to try and make his.
“I want to definitely win a Pac-12 championship,” Nootbaar said. “That’s why I came here: I wanted to put USC back on top.”
Now we go to OSU to be swept again.  Growing pains aside, this team stinks and I see no measurable progress.
Lars will have a hard time pushing the team even to the. top half of the Pac-12. Pitching so bad now no lead is safe.
Admit offense has been a surprise scoring enough runs to have.swept Cal instead of being swept. Baseball is a young
sport with good players leaving after their junior year so team must put it together in players early years.

This weekend, the eighth-ranked women’s lacrosse team was victorious in a trip to Northern California, defeating Stanford 15-12 on Friday and UC Davis 18-9 on Sunday.
Friday’s win was significant because it earned the Trojans the No. 1 seed in the upcoming MPSF tournament, which they will host at McAlister Field this week. USC looks to continue its winning streak after stretching it to eight games in a row and 18 straight conference games.
USC’s commanding offense is highlighted by senior attackers Michaela Michael, Kylie Drexel and Gabby McMahon, who combined for 12 of the team’s 15 goals against Stanford. For Drexel, the game marked her career-high performance with five goals, four assists, three ground balls, two draw controls and a caused turnover. Michael recorded five goals of her own for the eighth time in her career. With the win, USC improved its record against Stanford to 5-3 all-time.
On Sunday, the Trojans continued to demonstrate their offensive prowess against the Aggies, as three different Trojans — Michael, Drexel and senior midfielder Drew Jackson — scored hat tricks for the sixth time this season. Jackson’s triple came within a 28-second span, and Michael was dominant in the center circle, securing 10 draw controls.
“It’s great that the older players are stepping up,” head coach Lindsey Munday said. “Hopefully, the young players can continue to look to them for guidance and continue to gain the confidence from them — and from us as a group — so that they can step up in these big moments as well, which they definitely are doing.”
After the two wins, the Trojans locked in as the top seed at this week’s MPSF Tournament. With the regular season complete, Munday reiterated that there were always things to improve on.
“We’re happy with two wins, but there’s definitely things that we need to improve upon before we enter the postseason,” Munday said.
As defending MPSF champions, USC hopes to repeat this season and put itself in a position to secure an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament.
“We want to go out on top and make sure that we put ourselves in the best position to get an automatic berth,” Munday said. “It’s the only way that you know that you’re in, and that’s our focus right now. It has nothing to do with last year— it just has to do with being in control of our own destiny.”
The first round of the MPSF Tournament kicks off on Thursday with a matchup between Stanford and Cal. USC is the No. 1 seed, earning the Trojans a first-round bye. They will begin their tournament in the
semifinal round on Friday, facing either Oregon or San Diego State at noon at McAlister Field.
We have a very impressive coaching staff and team.  How far they’ve come in just 4 years is a marvel and a direct tribute to Coach Munday.  Best of luck in the post-season!

In almost any industry you can think of, trends come and go as quickly as the wind blows.
In fashion, there’s always the new accessory or handbag that is a
must-have on Monday. But on Tuesday you’re a fashionless fool if you’re still rocking it. In economics, there always seems to be the “can’t miss” investment that riles up Wall Street but eventually degrades into a deep money hole.
The opening week-and-change of the NBA Playoffs have revealed similar fads in the world of sports.
The 2016-17 NBA regular season was dominated by historic statistical performances. Whether it was the craze over triple-doubles or historic 3-pointer totals, offensive numbers dominated the focus of this season.
These statistics, however, are brief obsessions. The first round has exposed the NBA’s statistical fads thanks to arguably basketball’s biggest constant over the past decade-and-a-half: the greatness of LeBron James.
James and the Cleveland Cavaliers are coming off of a first-round sweep of the Indiana Pacers, and while the 4-0 series win may paint the Pacers as a blow-by opponent for the Cavs, they were anything but an easy opening matchup. All four games finished with a winning margin of six points or less.
Game 3 saw Cleveland overcome a 25-point halftime deficit to defeat Indiana, 119-114, on the road. With fellow stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love sitting out the fourth quarter, James led the Cavaliers to the greatest second-half comeback in NBA Playoff history. James finished the game with 41 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists, playing one of the greatest individual halves in basketball history.
Then, in Sunday’s close-out game in Indiana, James nailed a 3-pointer with 1:08 remaining in regulation to give Cleveland a one-point lead it would not surrender, sending the Cavaliers through to the conference semifinals.
James has now won his last 21 first-round games, dating back to his Miami Heat playing days.
Doesn’t it feel like just yesterday when folks routinely cracked on James for his lack of the “clutch-factor”? And look, I — a pretty huge LeBron apologist — will admit that the Dallas meltdown in the 2011 NBA Finals was pretty catastrophic. There was no clutch in the then-26-year-old James.
But since that series, James has proven time and time again that he is one of the league’s premier crunch-time players, rising up in the biggest moments.
Just one year ago, it was James who led the Cavaliers to overcome a 3-1 series deficit to the Golden State Warriors and win the NBA Championship. That wasn’t just any team that the Cavs reeled off three consecutive wins against — it was the all-time greatest regular season team in history: the  73-9 Warriors.
Last year’s Finals saw James become the first player in league history to lead all five major statistical categories over the duration of a playoff series. In seven finals games against the Warriors, James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals and 2.3 blocks per game.
Yeah, you’d better put some respect on this man’s name.
But, naturally, some will stubbornly refuse to do so. It’s incredible to think that just hours after the Cavaliers closed out the Pacers (with James scoring 33 points and grabbing 10 rebounds), ESPN published a piece titled, “Is this the beginning of LeBron James’ end?” Haters, obviously, are going to hate.
They can deny the greatness, but they can’t deny the resume — that’s there to stay. There’s the 13 All-Star Game selections, four league MVP trophies, three world championships and the scoring title. But what is perhaps James’ greatest achievement is the fact that he has played in the last six NBA Finals, starting from 2011. In the Eastern Conference, having James on your team has been an automatic bid to basketball’s biggest stage.
And this year’s Cavaliers team is looking no different. Consecutive Finals trip No. 7 looks to be on tap for James this postseason.
As the rest of the Eastern Conference teams fight through series that will likely go six or seven games in length, the Cavs are doing something they’ve been able to do quite a bit this season: rest.
The Cavaliers’ minute-reducing tactics for its starters this season have been well-documented and heavily criticized from all sides. Cleveland’s willingness to rest its starters, even for nationally televised games during the regular season, shows just where this team’s treasure is. James’ team is all about the Larry O’Brien Trophy — and nothing else.
For James, his fire for NBA titles far outweighs regular season glory — which he has already accumulated plenty of. He’ll let the NBA have its flashy triple-doubles, first-round Game Sevens and primetime regular season matchups. After all, those are just fads. Winning championships — that’s the ultimate constant.

Usually my “Sips Tea” articles are lighthearted, fun and even a little sassy. But this week, like some weeks before, is different. I want to use this platform to talk about an important message that needs to be heard, especially after the popularity of a recently released Netflix show 13 Reasons Why has entered many conversations I’ve had among friends lately and in a recent Daily Trojan article. The issues the show addresses and brings to light, including bullying, emotional and physical abuse, sexual assault, and suicide are all topics that are hard to talk about given their nature. 
For those of you who have not seen the show, it is about a girl in high school, Hannah Baker, who eventually takes her own life after suffering through more than a year of repeated offenses that go unnoticed and unpunished. She leaves behind 13 reasons for her decision to commit suicide on cassette tapes for her perpetrators to listen to in hopes of forcing them to look at themselves in the mirror. 
Although it is an intensely triggering and at times graphic show, 13 Reasons Why still makes me grateful that it was produced. It comes at a time when schools, especially high schools and universities, are doing a much better job at taking notice of issues such as student mental health in an effort to prevent suicides on campuses.
Before entering the University, students are required to take online classes including AlcoholEDU and a sexual assault awareness course. For many students, unfortunately, these courses present more of a “click through” burden than actual education on such important topics — something that I hope the University finds a way to address in the future. If tools and programs like these are enforced in a much stronger way, then perhaps the offenses that Hannah Baker faced in 13 Reasons Why might not continue to be as prevalent as they are.
There is a famous saying,“Treat others how you would want to be treated.” Though it’s a saying that is often uttered, it’s also not a standard often met. I know that many times I have not wanted to be nice to someone who was not to me. I have held grudges and not forgiven out of spite or hurt or jealousy. We all have. Whether it was a big or small reaction, if we answer honestly, all of us have fallen short of this golden rule. But it’s time we all try to do better. 
Before I graduate, I want to leave this community better than when I entered. By not actively participating in change, you are just as much to blame for the things that fall short of this golden rule. Bystanders are passive. Sticking to the status quo is passive. I want to call us, as USC students, as young adults, as humans, to do better. To be active. As Ghandi said, “Be the change you want to see in the world.” It takes every one of us to change the culture of this community, whether that be your classroom, your sorority or fraternity, even your own group of friends.
I want to use what is left of my some 600 words a week to give everyone a place to start.

Every year, my family and I go to Colorado to ski. Over spring break, we made our annual trip to Vail.  Generally speaking, I ski blues confidently and vehemently avoid moguls and black diamond hills. However, over break, I was faced with the feat of skiing a black diamond. This was a complete accident as I got lost trying to ski down the mountain, and I had no other choice but to go down it. Looking down at it, I was terrified and contemplated taking off my skis and just walking down the hill. I knew this would not be a realistic endeavor because the slopes were just about to close, and there was so much traffic going down the hill. I took a deep breath and started my journey down this intimidating path. Despite how scared I was, I reminded myself to make wide turns and not to look down at the hill. Slowly but surely, curve by curve, turn by turn, I made it to the bottom safely without falling or getting an injury. I smiled, proud that I accomplished something I never imagined I would achieve. 
In this stressful time as the semester wraps up, I remind myself of this moment during spring break. I was extremely overwhelmed by the sight of that black diamond hill and knew that if I skied straight down it, I would lose control and seriously injure myself. Like that hill, if you attack all of your academic and extracurricular responsibilities at once, you are going to paralyze yourself and will not effectively complete everything. We must remember to divide all of our work into manageable chunks and triage everything based on priority. Making careful turns on a black diamond hill is a perfect metaphor for this: take everything piece by piece. As college students, we are inevitably going to be faced with difficult tasks as required by our classes and activities, but our success in them depends on how we approach these hurdles. If we pile them on ourselves like a giant weight, we are the only ones impeding our success. I cannot emphasize enough how important the first step to manage life as a busy college student is to take a deep breath. We have to remember that academic stresses are like a steep, black diamond hill that must be approached with care and assiduity. Finals are approaching, and to my fellow students reading this, freshmen and seniors alike, I urge you to view them in the same way that I viewed that hill after I skied down it, unscathed. My overarching point is that some things in life can be extremely hard to deal with, but conquering them comes from effectively managing them.
