Pornography — there is possibly no other word that provokes a greater reaction, but that’s exactly what Oregon-based writer Kevin Sampsell was counting on.
Bookworm · Sampsell, a 42-year-old Oregon-based writer and employee at legendary independent bookstore Powell’s City of Books, recounts his life experiences through a series of vignettes in A Common Pornography.  - Photos courtesy of Harper Collins 
“The word in itself is so strange because people have such different feelings about it,” Sampsell said. “Some people think it’s dirty and shameful, some people think it’s free expression and really liberating.”
But for Sampsell, pornography is a term he uses to capture a series of life experiences that are immeasurably common. In his 256-page memoir called A Common Pornography, Sampsell tells his tale in a series of vignettes, revisiting life in the quiet town of Kennewick, Wash., where he and his brother Matt played Nerf football and saw a spaceship.
From the easy heyday of being a kid to the awkward pubescent years of dealing with raging hormones and ill-fated romances, Sampsell’s prosaic tales charm the reader with a humiliating degree of truthfulness that is both poignant and heartfelt.
A shorter version of the memoir was published under the same title in 2003 as a way to test audience reception. Sampsell, who works at one of the largest independent bookstores in the world, Powell’s City of Books in Portland, Ore., started his own small press and published about 500 to 600 copies.
“A lot of people really liked it and wanted to read more,” Sampsell said.
But it wasn’t until a certain event in his life — which, in the end, proved to be both destructive and reparative — that he decided to pick up the pen again.
“Two years ago when my dad passed away … my mom set up meetings with all [of us] and told really weird stories,” Sampsell said. “A few weeks later, I was like, ‘I think I want to write about this stuff too.’”
For the following eight months, Sampsell breathed life into his past by compiling many more short stories, capturing his life in written snapshots. The work was finally released in its complete form at the beginning of this month. The result, Sampsell says, is “a mix of nostalgic childhood memories that are funny and weird, with dark family secrets.”
Sampsell realized the narrative shortcomings of his actual life, but he tried to turn its weaknesses into strengths.
“I thought people might be bored with me writing about my own life in memoir form,” Sampsell said. “I wasn’t hooked on drugs, and I wasn’t having sex at 12. It’s not like the usual memoir kind of hook.”
But it is exactly Sampsell’s scandal-free childhood that is the story’s primary charm. It isn’t a story of gang wars written from within prison walls, and it’s not a tale of recovering from a longtime addiction. Nor does it have a groundbreaking style of writing or an impressive list of metaphors and symbolism.
It’s the fact that the stories — stripped bare of pretension and fluff — touch on common experiences. Sampsell tells of his embarrassing moments with no apologies, and it is in this that his memoir shines above the rest.
“When people read the first version of the book, they said, ‘It made me think about what I used to do with my friends,’” Sampsell said.
In several stories, he recounts his expansive collection of porn — earmarked magazine pages and cut-up pictures that he hid in an old suitcase, describing how he later had to move it to a new spot above a loose tile in his bedroom ceiling.
Other vignettes deal with excruciatingly humiliating details about all things sex-related — from his encounter with a chubby prostitute who took his virginity to harboring dirty thoughts.
Sampsell said his courage to write about incredibly personal secrets came from his past fiction works, many of which also delved into uncomfortable territory.
“I’ve been telling people that there’s a statute of limitation on my shame,” he said. “I think if you show the most embarrassing or shameful things about yourself [to others], you’re a lot more likeable.”
Sampsell, who is now 42, regards the majority of these vignettes as illustrations of who he was more than 20 years ago. Yet, he retells his stories with such a matter-of-fact boldness that it gives courage to the reader to wave his own freak flag high.

The candidates that assume the mantle of the Undergraduate Student Government president and vice president face the taxing responsibility of reconciling the workings of a complex institution with the needs of a diverse student body.
Although some of the candidates have listed their many combined years of USG experience, undergraduates need a ticket that is not only familiar with USG but with other on-campus organizations. This year’s presidential nominees will need to make an effort to collaborate with the student body in order to actualize their goals.
For this reason, the editorial board of the Daily Trojan has decided to endorse Chris Cheng and Nehi Ogbevoen.
Cheng boasts two years with USG, a tenure that should provide him a firm grasp on the bureaucratic workings of student government. His running mate Ogbevoen, on the other hand, has demonstrated his leadership capabilities in his work with Troy Camp, Dance Marathon and the Greek community, proving that he has a thumb on the pulse of student activity.
It is the pitfall of every USG election for many tickets to give laundry lists of ambitious and, in some cases, unattainable goals. While these lists are often attractive to the student body, we the students would be best served by promoting a candidate with realizable promises.
Though Cheng and Ogbevoen share many goals with other candidates, they distance themselves through their research, evidenced by the depth of Cheng’s responses provided at the USG debate. More importantly, the ticket has stressed increased accountability and transparency in USG operations, a quality that will not only increase student participation, but will also enhance the organization’s credibility.
Cheng and Ogbevoen also bring a necessary charisma to the office. For a student government that hasn’t always been able to engage its constituency, Cheng-Ogbevoen proposes a series of town hall meetings where students would have an open forum with USG representatives, removing the smog-like curtain between USG and the rest of the school.
Although Cheng and Ogbevoen might not have the combined USG experience of other platforms, we feel they bring a diversity and ability to reach out effectively to the student body that will ultimately produce tangible results.
Without question, Chris and Nehi are the strongest ticket. Cheng-Ogbevoen combine two ideal qualities in presidential and vice presidential candidates–experience and personality. Where others show some experience, they lack the balance of strong presence to actually connect to the administration and students.   
Props to the DT for stepping up and endorsing two very qualified candidates.

Ah, freshman year — when makeshift kitchens consisted of a microwave, mini-fridge and a contraband blender. Hard times indeed but those who resigned to living off of Lean Cuisine and Top Ramen have only themselves to blame. Because when it’s not ruining your gold-rimmed plates or pulsating invisible radiation into the air, the humble microwave is a box for culinary brilliance.
Anything can be made in a microwave — from tasty omelets to soft brownies — and none of it needs to come from a frozen box. If there’s no time for an Everybody’s Kitchen breakfast feast, or if you’re sick of Clif bars, there is no better tool for a fast, yummy breakfast than the microwave.
Three easy breakfasts are eggs, toast and oatmeal. Eggs are a great way to get some early morning protein, and yolks are like weird-consistency yellow multivitamins. Liquid eggs, such as Egg Beaters, are a great alternative and are a little easier to work with.
All it takes to have a microwave-made omelet is a mug or bowl and some cooking spray. Spray down the mug or bowl and add the eggs or liquid eggs. Beat the eggs, then microwave for 60 seconds. Take out, stir and add your mix-ins. Salt, cheese and spinach are just a few tasty options. Microwave for another 30 seconds, or until the mixture is set, and let cool for a few moments, then devour.
You might have once tried to make toast in the microwave, winding up with a soggy mess or a monster crouton. Although bread doesn’t really toast in the microwave, it can easily be made into a hot piece of bread that’s stiff but not brick-dry. The trick is to swaddle both sides of the bread in a paper towel or napkin, microwave for 15 seconds, then flip and microwave for 15 more. Let cool for a few moments, then eat. This also works with English muffins, pita bread and other carb-loaded goods.
Oatmeal, however, is the true breakfast of champions. Pair with some eggs or Greek yogurt and you have a long-lasting powerhouse. Quaker may have its army of sugar-saturated, microwave-friendly instant packs, but you can make a far tastier bowl if you take just an extra minute or two. Get some Quick Oats and add milk or water, microwave for one minute, but keep an eye on it — oats can bubble over. Take out and stir. Now, add in anything your little heart desires — cinnamon, bananas, chocolate chips, peanut butter or all of the above. Microwave for another 30 seconds, splash in a little extra milk if desired and eat. You’ll never go back to the freeze-dried apple chunks again.
Although its reputation would bediffer, microwaves are also quite capable of cooking beef, chicken and fish. If you know what you’re doing (or know how to use Google), you can craft tasty, little plates of gourmet cuisine. But it does take finesse and possibly a few failed attempts to master microwave salmon steak duxelles. Take the modern route and choose Ziploc.
Ziploc Zip ‘n Steam bags are the best thing to happen to easy cooking since the crock pot. You can throw your meat and vegetables all into the baggie, add in your spices and oils and heat according to the directions (which are printed on each bag). Sit back and revel in a delicious, healthy and effortless dinner. You can even add frozen meat and vegetables, so keep a stash of frozen chicken breasts in your freezer and you will be in business. Just a word of warning though: If the meat is frozen, there will be water at the bottom of the bag when it’s done, so be careful of scalding liquid.
Now, for dessert. Ever get a late-night craving for brownies? If you have any kind of cake or brownie mix, you can make a personal cake right in your microwave. All you need is a can of soda. First, spritz a bowl or mug with cooking spray. Spoon as much of the mix as you want to eat into the bowl. Add enough soda (both diet and regular work) so that it has the consistency of pancake batter. Cover with a napkin and place in the microwave. Time will vary depending on how much mix you used, but start with 60 seconds and keep an eye on it. Add more time as needed, until you have a perfect little mini-cake. Take it out a little early for a fudgier alternative. Cool Whip is optional.
And who says protein powder is just a utilitarian post-workout supplement? For athletes who have whey protein powder, just combine a scoop with a little milk, liquid egg whites or water, and you will be seconds away from a protein brownie (or blondie)! If you are feeling extra frisky, add in peanut butter, spices or any 21 Choices mix-in.
Now you have no excuse for complaining to Mom that you can never get a good meal — unless you’re just trying to score some cash or cookies. With only your standard microwave and refrigerator, a year’s worth of decent food is at your fingertips. So next time you feel like procrastinating on your paper, forget that traumatizing SpaghettiO’s episode and make friends with the microwave.

… interesting. love your columns.
I am a big fan of the zip and steam bags:  People don’t realize how much one can make in a microwave until they really try.  I also like that one can cut down on prep time given the right utensils (spoons, knives, etc.) and prepping in bulk (putting away extra portions of ingredients in fridge in air-tight bags) makes for easier preparations or a late-night snack if you’re studying late.

Student manager not solely to blame
Yes, Stan Holt’s actions in the game against Oregon were ill-advised and dumb. Yet, I disagree with Jon Haber’s arguments (“Student manager was out of place,” Feb. 1, 2010) on two terms.
Holt cost the team a technical foul due to his reactions to a call by the referee during the basketball team’s game against Stanford, but your claims that only a coach and a star player should be allowed to get technical fouls as well as your argument that he lost the game for the team is a point of stasis for me.
First, the claim that only a star player or coach can receive technical fouls: I find the flaw in your lack of evidence. I need more evidence that shows direct citations of players who received technical fouls and came back and re-scored the lost points and led their team to victory, or, in the case of USC, kept the momentum and finished the “comeback.” Also, I see no evidence to support the claim of a coach being able to receive technicals. I need sufficient evidence showing a team can rally behind a loss of points from a coach. There are so many more variables that are involved in rallying behind the leadership of  coach that are overlooked here.
Secondly, I would assume that you agree that there are more than two people on a basketball team. Thus, there are more than two people who can affect the outcome of the game. Holt’s technical foul was not the only factor that lead to USC’s loss that night, and I’m sure everyone on the USC men’s basketball team would have to agree with that.

CBS an unfair target for criticism
This letter is in response to Christopher Agutos’ column, (“CBS fails to score with gay community,” Feb. 1, 2010).
The entertainment industry bases its foundation on pleasing its audiences on a wide-scale in order to reap profit. CBS, as a private corporation, has no obligation to change perceptions of Americans. I agree that the media could do a better job in depicting reality and promoting equality and fairness, but we must recognize that we are not in a position to criticize them when they fail to do so. They are businesses — plain and simple. They will run their businesses in order to generate more revenue. They need to provide entertainment, even in the form of commercials, to please those “millions of Americans who might still be uncomfortable with gay rights.” CBS is no different than any other studio in wanting to please its audiences. And especially in such a large-scale event like the Super Bowl, any studio would be overly cautious as to the types of commercials aired during the event.
Additionally, the racy Miller Lite commercial aired during the 2003 Super Bowl is poor evidence that CBS’s standard for commercials was inconsistent and played a double standard over the years. As mentioned in the article, the 2003 Super Bowl was aired on ABC. We’re dealing with two separate corporations, so that evidence does nothing to support the author’s claim. If CBS indeed had a clear history of inconsistent standards, finding a relevant example concerning CBS alone should have been a breeze.
Why attack CBS? Why now?

In 1941, Universal Pictures released the archetypal werewolf movie, The Wolf Man. Chilling and atmospheric, the film told the story of a man (Lon Chaney Jr.) who, upon returning to his father’s home in Wales, was bitten by a werewolf and inherited the now-infamous curse.
Moonlight madness · Filled with shout outs to both the 1935 and 1941 originals, director Joe Johnston’s The Wolfman follows a Shakespearean actor (Benicio Del Toro) after being bitten by a werewolf. - Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures  
In addition to providing moviegoers with 70 minutes of fright, The Wolf Man offered a contrast between the Americanized, modern life Chaney’s character led and the superstitious, traditional style his father followed. The clash of old and new, as well as the family drama, gave the film added depth and made The Wolf Man an instant horror classic.
Now, 59 years after the original, Universal Pictures has remade The Wolf Man as The Wolfman. Many concerned fans of the original worried that the classic concept and character wouldn’t hold up in an era characterized by the Saw franchise and Twilight-style werewolves, but the new film stands as positive proof of the strength of the source material. The Wolfman is a horror film in the classic sense, echoing the style of the original and creating a compelling, frightening movie for modern audiences.
Following the death of his brother Ben, Shakespearean actor Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns to his home in the English countryside. Haunted by tragedy in his childhood, he reunites with his estranged father (Anthony Hopkins) and Ben’s fiancée Gwen (Emily Blunt). However, while hunting Ben’s killer at a gypsy camp, Lawrence is attacked and bitten by a werewolf. Now doomed to transform on the full moon, Lawrence struggles to find his humanity and escape those who would kill him for what he has become.
Director Joe Johnston keeps a steady handle on the pace of the film, quickly setting up the plot without rushing into things. The film does stumble in the second act where it hits its weakest part as Lawrence is taken to an insane asylum in London. Beyond a terribly cliché German doctor, the segment adds little to the film and seems like a contrived attempt to put the Wolfman in a metropolis — perhaps as an homage to the original’s 1935 predecessor, Werewolf of London.
However, the film recovers from the bumps, and the entirety of the third act is a tense, dramatic culmination of the relationships and conflicts in the film. Part chase, part fight and with more than a few shout-outs to the original, the climax of the film is perfectly handled.
The film’s tension relies on the characters’ relationships with each other, and the cast does not disappoint. Del Toro’s haunted take on Lawrence is subtle and effective; as the Wolfman, he is primal and animalistic, his body language conveying the raw aggression of the character sublimely.
Hopkins’ Sir John Talbot is a wonderful take on the classic archetype of the “great white hunter,” complete with a loyal manservant and the furs of exotic animals. Hopkins avoids delving into camp, and instead plays John as an eccentric, reclusive figure with his own demons.
Blunt pulls off the Victorian lady with ease, and her chemistry with Del Toro feels natural, giving her character a larger role than her 1941 counterpart. Rounding out the main cast is Hugo Weaving as police inspector Frederick “Francis” Aberline, the man who led the investigations in the Jack the Ripper murders. With a sharp, cynical wit and a commanding authority, Weaving is a thrill to see on screen, and his scenes with Del Toro are among some of the film’s best as the two are a perfect match in both intellect and presence.
The cinematography and design of the film is exquisite and classic in style. Foggy countrysides dominate the film, with decrepit manors covered in overgrowth adding to the traditional horror vibe of the film.
Rick Baker’s makeup for Del Toro is detailed and scary, with sharp fangs and a large amount of fur. The film avoids CGI and instead sticks to realistic effects. It is refreshing to see the classic werewolf on screen, standing on two feet with tattered clothes. It is an iconic image, and Del Toro and Baker pull it off.
What makes Johnston’s movie so effective is that it is actually frightening. Harkening back to classic horror films, The Wolfman favors moody, fog-covered forests and suspense over the excessive gore and sudden surprises that dominate the torture porn and horror films of today. This classic style of horror actually turns out to be far more effective than any of the modern techniques. That’s not to say there isn’t violence in the film — because there is. However, the build of tension and suspense serves to make the bloodshed far creepier.
The Wolfman isn’t a perfect movie; it has its faults here and there, however, they are truly minor. The overall story, terrific acting and classic horror tone make it the best werewolf movie in a very long time, if not one of the best horror movies in a long time.
It strikes the delicate balance of being true to the original while still being its own film. The Wolfman is proof that movies don’t need gore and cheap thrills to be frightening and that sometimes a traditional approach is best.
I have to say that watching Wolfman filled me with a sense of nostalgia.  The Wolfman was an actual Wolf Man and not a large wolf.  The images they used for makeup came straight out of the original movie, and I greatly appreciated it.  I also liked the fact that the gore was subtle.  In some movies you need a lot of gore, but in this the lighter touch worked well.

Theater is immersion. So when some chump a few rows over is making moment-killing noises during a show — whether that’s pneumonic coughs or ill-timed whoops of praise — standard protocol is to give them the stink eye.
Sing it · Angela Robinson as Shug Avery leads the cast of The Color Purple in “Push Da Button,” one of the production’s most soulful tunes. - Photos courtesy of Broadway L.A. 
I have never known an exception to this rule. I like my theaters kept relatively silent, especially at emotional high points, so that I can stay completely in the moment. Even in musicals, there is a time to clap and a time to pipe down.
Except this once — a moment of unbridled spontaneity from an over-rambunctious woman that summed up a near-perfect night.
It was act two of The Color Purple at the Pantages Theatre. Fantasia Barrino, playing Celie, was wailing through her climactic solo, “I’m Here.” After a particularly big note — a soul-piercing cry of pain overcome, impeccably belted — a woman sitting somewhere in the front screamed out, “That’s right, Fantasia. Sing it, girl. You sing!”
I was for a second furious that someone would spoil my special moment. Barrino was singing to me, not to that obnoxious woman, whoever she was. But before she could open her mouth again to finish the song, I realized my fury was born of pure selfishness. Almost immediately, it was replaced by radiance, and I started smiling uncontrollably.
Barrino was killing it onstage — she plumbs a depth of pain and depravity scarcely seen in these sorts of commercial productions. Something obviously resonated with the shouter in the front, and she couldn’t contain her enthusiasm. Who was I to give her the stink eye?
Live theater is a group experience. People who think otherwise, I learned, are seriously missing out. Once I embraced the rowdy crowd, the experience — already powerful — became unforgettable.
As it happens, it was the best crowd I think I’ve ever been part of — a fact I can only attribute to the success of this show. It’s the second iteration of Alice Walker’s Pulitzer Prize–winning epistolary novel (Steven Spielberg’s film was the first) — this time given the Broadway musical treatment.
People like to act pretend-shocked that such a serious story had been musicalized, but in reality it wasn’t much of a stretch. Spielberg’s film has musical sequences that work splendidly, especially the one where Shug Avery (played by a sultry Angela Robinson) marches to her father’s church. Oddly enough, that scene isn’t in the musical. In fact, Shug’s reconciliation with her father, a subplot found nowhere in the book, is barely mentioned, which makes one wonder why it was included at all.
The show’s basic problems can be traced back to its overstuffed script: It smashes together two warring sensibilities — Walker’s and Spielberg’s — and so inevitably misrepresents both. The uneven narrative, moreover, can’t find a rhythm and the episodic structure of the novel is carelessly executed. Temporal coherence is evidently not a priority for these scriptwriters; chunks of time pass by vaguely and unexpectedly and nothing seems to flow particularly well.
Also problematic is the start of the second act: a prolonged African dance sequence that probably looked exciting on paper but in reality is messy and unnecessary.
Despite these obvious shortcomings, the show is salvaged by the remarkable strength of its female performances, particularly Barrino’s. Celie’s story starts off pretty pitifully. She is carrying her own father’s child, and when it is born Pa steals him from Celie’s loving arms and gives him away.
Pa then forces Celie to marry Old Mister Johnson (Rufus Bonds Jr.), a mean man with an eye for Celie’s younger sister, Nettie (La Toya London, an enchanting, underutilized vocalist). Nettie is the only ray of sun in Celie’s ever-darkening night. Johnson, once rejected by Nettie, kicks her out. Nettie is ripped kicking and screaming from Celie’s arms but not before she promises to write.
“Nothing but death will keep me from it,” she cries.
Years pass, and no letters arrive. Celie takes her sister for dead and her life for meaningless. She thinks God and humanity have given up on her — or never cared in the first place. Of course, she is wrong, but she only learns that later.
The arrival of jazz singer Shug, Old Mister Johnson’s somewhat still-burning flame, awakens something in Celie she never knew was there. The relationship that blossoms between Celie and Shug — fleshed out in the book, sheepishly alluded to in the movie, acknowledged in the musical — forms the emotional center of the play. Robinson’s Shug is sweet but not sentimental, and her voice is so bluesy it makes you heartsick.
Other performances that stand out include Felicia P. Fields as the unconquerable Sofia, a Theatre World Award-winning role that she originated on Broadway, and Stu James as Sofia’s charismatic man, Harpo. The other men are comparatively weak. Rufus Bonds Jr. is an unstoppable vocalist but can’t find the right tone and David Aron Damane as Pa tries too hard.
But this is Barrino’s story, and she is unmatched in believability, power and intensity. Her somewhat polarizing voice — some can’t stand it, others say it’s on par with the best there ever was — takes some warming up to, but the payoff is show-stopping. There is, if it’s possible, a sort of effortless strain to her singing, an inbuilt emotional rawness that can’t be faked. Where others sing words, she feels them. “I’m Here,” a soaring ballad that marks a turning point in her life, is alone worthy of a standing ovation.
The soundtrack is churchy like you wouldn’t — or maybe would — believe, and I mean that in the best way possible. The gospel chorus gets a number of well-deserved laughs, and the religiosity never feels overbearing. The only problem is the poor sound. Whether it’s a problem with the Pantages’ acoustics — which are normally fine — or enunciation, I’m not sure, but it makes catching the subtleties and a few important plot points nearly impossible.
The Color Purple is flawed, that’s for sure, but that doesn’t stop the tears from flowing, the spirit from rejoicing or the soul from expanding. Seek this show out, and when Barrino takes center stage for “I’m Here” do everyone a favor and cry out, “That’s right, Fantasia. Sing it, girl. You sing!”

When I’m craving some In-N-Out, a BJ’s pizzookie or Diddy Riese, Westwood is my destination. With a car full of people, I make the trek to Bruin land and usually park in the parking structure on Broxton Avenue. The lot is often busy, so I drive past the long, empty row of spots reserved as electric car charging stations. Of all the times I have been there, I only recall a vehicle in those spots once; it was one of those nice, sporty golf carts.
In an effort to welcome more electric cars to San Francisco, the city is reforming its building code to require electric car charging stations in all new parking structures. So if you want to find parking in San Francisco, you better have an electric car. Otherwise you may be driving past a long row of unutilized spaces similar to the garage in Westwood.
The green movement fascinates economists as the green industry presents potential for growth in jobs and national income. But many fail to consider the ripple effects green initiatives can have on society. We need to become more aware of entire consequences.
What many people forget is that electric cars still pollute. These cars get their electricity from power plants. Power plants include everything from hydroelectricity and wind (green and clean) to nuclear and coal (dangerous and dirty).
According to U.S. statistics for 2009, coal accounted for more than 45 percent of total national energy production — the same energy that would be utilized by electric vehicles. Yet studies show that coal processes have a more dangerous effect on the environment than gasoline emissions.
The New York Times reported one in every five vehicles sold in the environmentally conscious town of Berkeley, Calif., is a Toyota Prius hybrid. If San Francisco demonstrates this scale of electric car demand, the city’s gasoline usage in the city would decrease.
Betsy Avila | Daily Trojan
Citywide energy procurement from power plants would need to increase. Since hydroelectric, wind and nuclear sources are more difficult and expensive to expand, San Francisco would have to inflate its coal and natural gas sources. Coal would likely develop most quickly because of its ease, large rate of energy return and low current usage (approximately 10 percent total city energy).
Any city with a large-scale increase in electric cars would likely face a similar initial expansion of coal energy sources. Thus, the cars would still pollute, they just outsource the pollution.
Andrew Tang, a Pacific Gas and Electric Co. utility executive, reported that one electric car can consume three times the amount of electricity as an average San Francisco house.
Another harsh effect on society from an increase in electric vehicles — essentially an increase in houses by Tang’s estimates — could be massively inflated energy prices. Electricity demand would increase, causing blackouts or higher utility prices, which could be disastrous for people already struggling.
Pollution and energy price concerns mixed with the general inconvenience of electric cars (the new Chevrolet Volt will get up to 40 miles on a single battery charge) make the vehicles rather unpromising as a solution to our pollution and energy problems.
On the bright side, it might be easier to find renewable sources of energy for power plants than for individual travel systems potentially giving a grand future to electric cars, assuming they start getting more than 40 miles on a charge.
Although San Francisco’s intended building code reformation might harm more lives than it helps, the city is setting an example to develop infrastructure to wean us off pollutants,as infrastructure is the biggest hindrance to new fuel sources is infrastructure.
We don’t buy electric cars or hydrogen vehicles because of a lack of charging stations. But we don’t build hydrogen pumps because no one has the car.
It is the classic chicken versus egg predicament.

You lost me when you tagged nuclear power as “dangerous and dirty” … or perhaps you just meant dangerous. It’s not. It’s arguably safer and a helluva lot more efficient than just about anything else. If we hadn’t listened to Fonda & Co. and their hysterical “no nukes” propaganda we would be much more energy independent now. Don’t perpetuate that “danger” myth.

Those of us who grew up during the 1990s watched the slow decline of MTV from a channel that played music videos around the clock to a channel spewing out mindless entertainment in the form of idiotic reality TV shows intended for adolescents. And although the good old days where “music” was the emphasis of Music Television’s programming has long disappeared, the Viacom channel just made it official with their recent logo change.
The new sign — which the station considers more of a refresh than a redesign— will no longer carry the words “Music Television” underneath the famous emblem. With this alteration, popular music fans can officially kiss the age of music videos goodbye as the network takes a more assertive step forward in its plans to replace music videos with programming that includes a large dose of reality television. With shows such as Jersey Shore, The Real World and The Hills, MTV no longer bears any resemblance to its original identity, famous for introducing the groundbreaking concept of airing music videos 24/7.
The logo change is also representational of a growing trend in the marketing world – the increasing flexibility of corporate logos that incorporate changeable images within the design. Joining the ranks of NYC & Company, AOL, and the marketing campaign for the London Olympics, MTV has gotten creative in its attempt to showcase what it has to sell – in this case, programming – within its logo.
With a wider and more transparent frame, the MTV logo is an optimal canvas for integrating images of popular personalities such as Snooki or The Situation within its borders. It is in MTV’s best interest to employ this popular method of advertising, as it effectively familiarizes audiences with the network brand while it pushes the programming at the same time.

Former USC basketball players shined brightly during the 2010 NBA All-Star Weekend.
High-flying rookie DeMar Derozan of the Toronto Raptors competed in the Sprite Slam Dunk Contest on Saturday. DeRozan earned a position in the Slam Dunk Contest by defeating Clippers guard Eric Gordon in the NBA’s first-ever Dunk-In on Friday.
In the first round, contestants had two dunks judged by a panel of former NBA star dunkers. For his first dunk, DeRozan did a between-the-legs reverse-dunk that earned him a score of 42. For his second dunk, DeRozan caught a pass from teammate Sonny Weems off of the side of the backboard, did a windmill, and dunked the ball on the other side of the basket, earning the only perfect score of the night, 50, from the judges.
DeRozan’s score on his first two dunks propelled him into the finals against New York Knicks guard Nate Robinson. For his first dunk in the finals, DeRozan jumped over the 6-foot-6 Weems, and caught an alley-oop pass that he stuffed through the net. In his final dunk, DeRozan started his dunk in the air from the back of the key, displaying how far he could jump.
Robinson narrowly defeated DeRozan by earning 51 percent of the vote, which was decided by text messages and online voting from fans. It was a record third Slam Dunk Contest victory for Robinson.
In an interview prior to Slam Dunk Contest, DeRozan’s former USC teammate, Taj Gibson, had predicted that DeRozan would do well.
“You should expect a lot of different things from [DeRozan],” Gibson said. “Everyday in practice, he tried something new, so I am looking forward to seeing what he is going to pull out of his hat. I know he has a lot of tricks up his sleeves.”
Two Trojans also played in the T-Mobile Rookie Challenge Friday night. Gibson, a rookie with the Chicago Bulls, was able to compete against the sophomore team featuring his former teammate, O.J. Mayo of the Memphis Grizzlies.
Gibson scored six points and grabbed two rebounds, helping the rookies defeat the sophomores for the first time since 2002, 140-128.
Mayo started for the sophomores and had eight points and 10 assists.

William Vega, a leading researcher on health disparities among aging populations, has been appointed executive director of the USC School of Social Work’s Edward R. Roybal Institute of Aging.
The Roybal Institute primarily conducts research and advocates policy geared toward improving the health of seniors, particularly those from multiethnic and low-income backgrounds.
Previously, Vega has served as director of UCLA’s Luskin Center on Innovation, where he received the Society for Prevention Research’s Community, Culture and Prevention Science Award and the National Hispanic Science Network on Drug Abuse’s National Award of Excellence in Research by a Senior Scientist.
He also holds professorship in USC’s Keck School of Medicine, and has performed research on health and substance abuse in both the United States and Latin America.
“[Vega] is widely considered one of the visionaries in this increasingly important field,” USC Executive Vice President C.L. Max Nikias said in a press release. “Ethnic minority groups comprise the fastest-growing segment within the U.S. aging population — and there is increasing need for research, education and outreach to address the particular needs of these groups.”
