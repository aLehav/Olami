During her freshman year, Teya Hisel grew frustrated because of how closed-off USC is from the surrounding community. 
“USC was making me really angry,” Hisel said. “I would walk through the gates and have to show my ID after a certain time — we literally live in a gated community.”
Coming to USC, Hisel knew she wanted to see more community engagement from USC as she believes they are “not doing nearly enough.” 
Hisel sought out opportunities on campus to get involved, including the United Way and the Downtown Women’s Center, and hoped to join the Housing Equity Project, a student organization that promotes housing equity around L.A., But when USC shifted to remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic, the club died out and Hisel began to think of other ways she could get involved in advocating for housing equality.
This semester, alongside Thomas Martynowicz, a sophomore majoring in international relations, and Atharva Tewari, a junior majoring in journalism and global studies, Hisel created advocaSC, a club that aims to support unhoused community members of Los Angeles through policy advocacy, education and outreach and direct service.
“I built advocaSC based off of the idea that you can’t do direct service without [also] addressing systemic issues, without addressing policy at the same time, and without educating the people in your community to support those policies and support that service,” Hisel, a junior majoring in global studies and philosophy, politics and law, said.
The club meets Tuesdays at 7 p.m. in THH 115 to coordinate upcoming projects and learn more about the issues faced by LA’s unhoused population. AdvocaSC also shares informational flyers on its Instagram profile and gives attendees the opportunity at the end of each meeting to anonymously submit questions about the houselessness crisis to be answered at the next meeting.
In March, the club hosted an event with the United Way of Greater Los Angeles community activation specialist Sarah Thomas and associate director of policy at LA Family Housing, Zack Warma, to discuss work in the nonprofit world. 
Hans Yang, a sophomore majoring in international relations with an emphasis on global business, has attended meetings since they began in January. Yang said he didn’t initially know much about the issue of houselessness in L.A. but decided to learn more because he, like other students, has lived in the city for the greater part of the year.
“The more I learned about it, I realized that it’s a really serious problem in L.A. and across America,” Yang said.
Students like Yang who have an interest in learning more about the houselessness crisis are encouraged to join advocaSC, even if they have no prior knowledge of the issue.
“If you want to join, then don’t be intimidated. There are so many people here who came in and they were like, ‘We have no idea about this,’” Tewari said. “You can come with no background information and we’ll educate you. This is a safe space for that.”
Kamy Akhavan, executive director of the USC Center for the Political Future, serves as the club’s adviser. Although the club is not directly affiliated with any other organizations, Hisel said she hopes to partner with CPF and other student organizations in the future.
“A bunch of us are in Delta Phi Epsilon, the international relations fraternity, a bunch of us are in Trojan Democrats, some of us are in other different things. So there’s no specific attachment to anything,” Martynowicz said.
Hisel and Martynowicz met through DPE and took inspiration from the fraternity’s meetings to develop their own unique tradition. At the start of each meeting, a small stuffed dog is given from the member who received it last to another member they wish to recognize.
“We do this thing in DPE where there are these stuffed foxes and every chapter meeting, whoever has the fox from last meeting gives it to someone else and recognizes them for something cool that they did or just being a cool person or whatever,” Hisel said. “I wanted to throw our own twist on it.”
Initially, Hisel thought of bringing in a stuffed apartment complex because the club advocates for multifamily homes and massive building of affordable housing, but then came across a doghouse full of stuffed dogs and saw the opportunity for a play on words.
“I’m a huge fan of like wordplay and puns, as you can tell by advocaSC,” Hisel said, “I saw it and I was like, ‘Oh my god, we can reclaim the idea of being in the doghouse as a good and celebratory thing because this is housing policy.’”
“[AdvocaSC] meetings are a great time with a great community of like-minded individuals trying to make our community a better place,” Martynowicz said. 
“If you’re interested in service, if you’re interested in supporting our unhoused neighbors, advocaSC is a great club to get involved in,” Hisel said. “This semester is our first semester, so we’re still just getting started. But watch this space, and please get involved.”
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that Teya Hisel is majoring in global studies and journalism. Hisel is majoring in global studies and philosophy, politics and law. A previous version of the article also stated that the club meets on Thursdays. The club meets on Tuesdays. The Daily Trojan regrets these errors.

An online student-run petition calling for USC to extend the pass/no pass deadline for this semester amassed 1,515 signatures at the time of publication. The petition asks for the deadline to select a pass/no pass grading option to be extended until April 15. 
Typically, the deadline is the end of the third week of classes. Students had the option to choose pass/no pass grading for any class, including major classes and electives in every semester between Spring 2020 and Fall 2021, up to 32 units. The deadline for Fall 2021 to select the grading option was the final day of classes. For Spring 2022, the deadline was extended following the two-week remote start to Feb. 11, the end of the fifth week of classes. 
Mikena Moore, a freshman majoring in business administration, created the petition last weekend. Moore, currently in her first semester at USC, said she has struggled academically this semester after some obstacles. 
“I’ve had COVID twice this semester and that’s four weeks, which was obviously detrimental to every class,” Moore said. “I looked at the other petitions [from past semesters] and got some ideas and started writing it.” 
After she posted about it on social media, other students reached out to her to express their support. Overall, student reactions have been mixed. Some petition viewers expressed negative reactions, writing comments such as “this is the most annoying thing I’ve ever seen” and “you guys are all lazy.” Moore said that although some people write positive comments, others may be afraid to support the petition.
Nikita Mei, a freshman majoring in computer engineering and computer science, expressed support for the extension. She said after two weeks of remote learning, much of which consisted of review of previous material, it was hard for her to tell whether to select pass/no pass for her classes.
“I can’t tell based off of review how well I’m going to do in that class,” Mei said. “Also, COVID was such a huge thing. Like we didn’t even know if we were going to come back. And now [coronavirus restrictions] are such a small thing; Trojan Check is gone, all these different things with COVID are gone. Why can’t we change the grading scale for those that are affected by COVID?”
As the deadline extension petition circulated online, the Undergraduate Student Government unanimously passed a resolution supporting “petition recognition” at its Senate meeting Tuesday night. The resolution calls for University administration to “implement a framework for petition recognition and acknowledgment that requires a University-wide email response to petitions that receive a minimum of 1500 signatures.”
In addition to the signature requirement, the USG resolution stated that petitions must “explicitly reference” some specific policy, department or action, contain a call to action and must “seek to advance the University priorities outlined in the University Mission Statement” in order to warrant a response from administration. 
Senator Victor Ye, inaugurated Tuesday, introduced the pass/no pass extension resolution. His proposed resolution, which he co-wrote with fellow senator Alvaro Flores, stated that administration should extend the deadline due to the two week delay of in-person instruction, the removal of the mask mandate, difficulties faced by spring admits and professors changing learning modalities. Ye and his running mate, senator Jessica Gonzalez, campaigned on extending the pass/no pass deadline. 
“There’s a lot of support from every senator and every person that believes in the understanding for those who have been affected, whether they’re immunocompromised students, those that are spring admits and those that are regular students that are facing medical emergencies,” Ye said. “There are a lot of different complications this semester that I think should not be overlooked.”
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, the University said they will not be changing or extending the current Pass/No Pass grading policy. 
“We are returning to normal grading practices in the interest of equity for all students,” the statement read. “We advise students to talk with their academic advisors to determine their options.”
The USG senate will hold an emergency meeting Thursday to discuss the pass/no pass resolution, “Extension of Pass/No Pass Grading Option for Spring 2022 Semester.” The resolution rides on the coattails of the petition Moore created, Ye said.
“The fact is that … this is not a first-time scenario — extensions of pass/no pass have been happening for the past three semesters, especially for the last semesters, that extended all the way to the last day of class,” Ye said. “Currently, we’re still on the trajectory of trying to extend the pass/no pass deadline as late as possible.”
Christina Chkarboul contributed to this report. 
Editor’s note: A previous version of the article stated that USG intends to debate the resolution addressing the pass/no pass extension next Tuesday. The resolution will be discussed Thursday at the emergency senate meeting. 
This story was updated at 1:19 a.m. to reflect that the petition has accumulated more than 1,500 signatures.

Two finalists have been selected in the search for a new Department of Public Safety Chief following former Chief John Thomas’ retirement Feb. 12, Associate Senior Vice President of Safety and Risk Assurance, Erroll Southers, announced in a communitywide email Wednesday. 
The finalists, whose identities have not been disclosed, were selected unanimously from a pool of 36 candidates in a nationwide search. The search will culminate in two Finalist Community Input Sessions held at Wallis Annenberg Hall April 15. Each will feature a finalist who will answer questions posed by community members. The finalists will then go through a final round of interviews with University leadership before the appointment is announced in May. 
Southers led the search process with the help of external executive search firm Spelman Johnson and a 22-person search committee consisting of faculty, staff, students and neighborhood stakeholders. Six Community Input Sessions were held starting Feb. 14, attended by more than 200 members of the community. Two sessions were held solely for DPS personnel. 
The selection of the finalists was based on a criteria of five competencies determined as most pertinent to community members during the input sessions: community, communication, diversity, transparency and engagement. The committee chose from a set of candidates with a minimum of five years of experience in campus or community public safety. The final candidates are both currently serving as chiefs and come from universities with diverse constituencies, Southers said during a student media briefing Wednesday.
“Both of these folks are very, very impressive when it comes to community engagement,” Southers said. “They understand the difference between campus public safety and municipal law enforcement, which is why we are selecting them to be the finalists.” 
Other key tenets the community brought up and the search committee considered were accountability, integrity, collaboration, team-building and the ability to work in large private institutions and large urban environments, Southers said. The committee drew from the recommendations and priorities described in last year’s Community Advisory Board report, which outlined DPS’ ONE USC Safety Vision, in determining the candidates most capable of encouraging an environment where “everyone feels safe, respected and protected from being a crime victim.” 
CAB was created in response to the “national urgency” of evaluating public safety practices, including departmental accountability, transparency, bias training and hiring. Over the course of 10 months, the Board conducted a series of conversations, public safety sessions and kitchen cabinet meetings attended by more than 700 community members. Southers said the committee emphasized the four thematic pillars outlined in the CAB report — accountability, alternatives to armed response, community care and transparency — in interviews with potential candidates. 
“We are really looking for somebody who can embrace the key reforms that we had, most importantly, reenvisioning public safety,” Southers said.

The tuition for the 2022-23 school year will be approximately $63,468 after the USC Board of Trustees approved a 5% increase. 
A statement to faculty and staff on March 29 from President Carol Folt about salary increases read that extra costs from the pandemic amounted to $1.2 billion. The University cited the coronavirus pandemic and resulting inflation as one of the main reasons for the increase. 
“The tuition increase is necessary due to both the magnitude of the financial impact of COVID-19 and persistent inflationary pressures facing our economy,” the statement read. 
USC was named in a class action lawsuit after the University did not give partial tuition refunds after the campus closure because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
“Essentially, students have paid Defendants for access to buildings they can no longer enter, technology the University is not providing, activities that are not available and meals that will never be served,” the complaint, filed in May 2020, read. “USC is thus profiting from COVID-19 while further burdening students and their families.” 
The University received more than $19 million from the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act after agreeing to the grant in April 2020. 
An open letter to administration from the USC chapter of the American Association of University Professors written in January 2022 called for faculty salary increases that are proportional to the cost of living in Los Angeles. The letter has garnered more than 900 signatures at time of publication.
“We need an annual cost-of-living adjustment, in addition to — not instead of — our ‘merit’  increases,” the letter read. “Given the inflationary trend, which shows no sign of abating, we will fall increasingly behind without it.”
Folt wrote in the March 29 statement that the University intends to invest $700 million into employee benefits, salary increases and market adjustments. USC has put aside $150 million for the first year of the plan. 
“Tuition is the largest source of the university’s academic operating budget, which pays for teaching, student services, facilities and administrative support,” the University statement read. “USC has long kept tuition increases below 5%; the last tuition increase of that size was in 2009 coming out of the Great Recession.”
From 2020 to 2021, the University’s endowment increased from $5,914,358,000 to $8,126,222,000. USC also reached two settlements in 2021 connected to the case of former USC gynecologist George Tyndall for $215 million and $852 million, totalling to over $1 billion in fees.
The University did not announce the tuition increase to the public. 
Correction: A previous version of this article stated that USC’s endowment grew from $5,914,358 to $8,126,222 between 2020 and 2021. USC’s endowment grew from $5,914,358,000 to $8,126,222,000. The Daily Trojan regrets this error.

One might not immediately think of museums when the city of Los Angeles is brought to mind, as the sunny beaches and Hollywood scene take most of the spotlight. Nevertheless, L.A. houses some of the most amazing museums in the world. It would simply be a shame to miss out on.
If you’re a lover of all things pop culture, a science and history aficionado or an admirer of art, the options are endless when it comes to L.A.’s exceptional museums. 
Academy Museum of Motion Pictures
Ever wanted to see the huge shark from Steven Spielberg’s “Jaws” in person? Now’s your chance. The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures is a movie buff’s dreamland with everything from an unbelievable collection of items, such as the typewriter used to write Alfred Hitchcock’s “Psycho,” to a costume room featuring iconic outfits, such as the famous flower gown from “Midsommar” or Dorothy’s ruby red slippers from “The Wizard of Oz.” And if you’ve ever dreamt of winning an Academy Award, here’s your opportunity to practice. The Academy Museum has their own “Oscars Experience” in which you can hear your name called, receive your award, and get a video taken in your very own Dolby Theatre simulation. Now there’s something to baffle your family with.
Griffith Observatory
One of the most popular museums in Southern California, the Griffith Observatory is a fantastic option for those fascinated by astronomy or even for those just looking to experience some spectacular views of L.A. and the Hollywood Sign. Located on Mount Hollywood, the Planetarium screens captivating shows in an all-dome projection room that dives into the universe and its alluring history surrounding the Big Bang and the formation of the cosmos. However, one of the coolest aspects of the Observatory is that the building’s Zeiss and solar telescopes are open to the public each day, giving you the opportunity to see the Moon, planets and stars like you’ve never seen them before. 
Natural History Museum 
Live out your “Night at the Museum” fantasy without having to go to New York City by visiting L.A.’s Natural History Museum. Located in Exposition Park, fun experiences such as the Butterfly Pavilion allow you to be one with the butterflies from March to September as you walk amid caterpillars and 30 different species of flying butterflies. Classic rooms such as the Dinosaur Hall take you back millions of years into the history of the dinosaurs and the “Becoming Los Angeles” exhibit launches you into the history of the Angelenos and the city’s love-hate relationship with water.  Also, “Becoming Jane: The Evolution of Dr. Jane Goodall” is a new exhibition that explores the life of the legendary conservationist who captured the world’s attention with her impactful observations of chimpanzees in the wild.
California African American Museum
Also located in Exposition Park, the California African American Museum concentrates on the history, art and education of the culture of African Americans, centering on the particular experiences in California and the West. With free admission, the museum contains photographs, paintings, artifacts and sculptures exhibiting the wide variety of additions of African Americans. The present exhibit highlighting African American women celebrates the accomplishments of people such as Dr. Maya Angelou and Alice Walker who have helped shape the society we live in today. Intriguing tours led by docents are available each day for a mere price of $3 for adults and $2 for students under the age of 17. 
The Getty Center
The Getty Center is a magnificent dedication to the arts with an extensive collection of household name artists such as Van Gogh, Renoir and Monet.

I hate “Jane Eyre.” Point blank period. It is one of the most chaotically unfeminist endings to a novel, and the beginning of the book gave me so much hope, only making matters worse.
Eyre is a young girl who is subjected to the mistreatment of her aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her wealthy cousins. She eventually gets sent to a boarding school and receives an education she later uses when she becomes a teacher at her school.  After being a teacher for a few years, she goes off to become a governess for  a young girl, Adele, who lives with a rich man, Mr. Rochester, at a place called Thornfield. 
Long story short, she falls in love with Rochester and is set to marry him when it is revealed that his wife, Bertha, is still alive and being held captive in the attic under the pretense that she is insane. Eyre, in order to marry Rochester, appeals to this in order to get Bertha sent to a psychiatric ward and live happily ever after. Ugh, and I thought Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca” was bad. 
Let’s talk about it. 
First, everyone boasts about this Bronte classic as the pinnacle of good literature. I’m not one to judge people on their favorite book — with the exception of people who say “Moby Dick” is their favorite — but this seems like a hate crime to all women, specifically women who have historically been labeled as “insane” due to their “progressive ideals.”
Any fan of “American Horror Story” remembers the “Asylum” season, when the protagonist, Pepper, is in a mental hospital analyzing the experiences of patients. Well, did you know that was based on a real story? The real asylum, Pennhurst, had cottages specifically for women who were deemed “mentally ill,” when in reality, most were just ahead of their time in the 1930s. The mistreatment and violations of the Asylum could be a whole other story, but for the purposes of “Jane Eyre,” it poses a real life parallel to the inhumane treatment of Bertha. Even if Bertha did suffer from mental illness, it did not warrant being neglected as a human being and having her locked up. On Eyre’s part, someone who suffered abuse as a young girl, I was expecting her to stand up for Bertha and get her the help she needed, not follow obediently behind Rochester. 
That brings me to my second point: the regression of Eyre. 
At the beginning of the novel, young Eyre had conviction, wit and independence. She rebelled against her aunt, which made her a colorful character — even growing up at a boarding school did not dim Eyre’s creativity and intelligence. It was upon meeting Rochester that we see a character regression take place. Instead of thinking for herself, Eyre becomes a ghost of who she was, clouded by the idea of love and attempting to get the approval of a man. The thing that angers me the most is how people label the Eyre and Rochester love affair as a fairytale rather than what it was: a relationship between a young girl being coerced by an older man to go against her independent ideals and seek a conventional idea of happiness at the expense of another woman. 
Not even Taylor Swift can remedy this novel of a 19-year-old falling in love with a significantly older man and bending to his needs — a problem in itself where intellectual young women in literature end up with gross older men — and trust me, Dr. Swift tried. 
In “folklore,” Swift has two songs dedicated to Jane Eyre: “invisible string” and “mad woman.” 
In the book, Eyre professes her love of Rochester as a “thread” tying them together, saying “I have a strange feeling with regard to you. As if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly knotted to a similar string in you.” 
Swift uses the idea of this “string” in her song “invisible string’’ which is about two lovers who find each other and feel like they were meant to be together, and explicitly states it in the lyric, “All along there was some invisible string tying you to me.” The song romanticizes the Rochester and Eyre love affair to be a serene match set by fate, when the reality of the circumstances is that this was a morphed love rooted in deception.
Swift, however, redeems herself with the underground hit, “mad woman.”Rooted in the “mad woman in the attic” stereotype, Swift comments on how women are historically reduced to being “crazy” to delegitimize them, writing, “Everytime you call me crazy, / I get more crazy, / What about that? / And when you say I seem angry, / I get more angry.” 
It’s impossible to not recognize how culturally significant “Jane Eyre” is today — just take Swift’s inspiration from the novel as an example of this. However, my quarrel is not with this simple truth, but rather with how the novel ended with a regressed, submissive — formerly independent — woman falling at the feet of a man willing to lock up his former wife because he thought she was “crazy.” 
Not only do I long for justice for Bertha, but also for Eyre, who deserved more than the paper-thin depth she was given by Bronte. But, I guess we can’t just blame Bronte for the societally rooted issue.  Historically female novelists were forced to marry off independent female protagonists and subject them to society in the 18th century. A sad reality. 
All this is to say that “Jane Eyre,” despite its chokehold on the canon, should not be above criticism. 
From me and my discontent,
Myriam

First of all, I’d like to wish everyone a happy April! From my point of view, this month is a time for us all to reflect on what we want from the end of the semester and where we want to find ourselves at the end of it all. For me, that reflection comes in the form of self-love, self-care and self-improvement. 
This April, I’m planning on transforming into a better version of myself. My usual self is constantly sending out anxious messages to family and friends or laying in bed thinking about how I could be more productive or really just worrying about everything that’s out of my control. That worrying prevents me from doing the things I actually want to do, like getting out there and interacting with people and the world. 
But I want to do better. In stronger terms, I want to transform — a concept that got me thinking about my beloved works of animation.
Transformation is at the core of many Pixar animated films. The latest hit from the studio, “Turning Red,” features a young Chinese Canadian girl who turns into a red panda whenever she’s particularly emotional. “Luca” is a film about a young boy who turns into a sea monster whenever he’s in the water. In both of these stories, transformation is something that’s initially feared but later embraced. 
Unlike the previous two films mentioned, the 2012 movie “Brave” doesn’t have a protagonist who transforms. Yet, in “Brave,” it’s the protagonist’s mother who is mistakenly turned into a bear, and that’s what eventually leads to the resolution of the mother-daughter conflict. The idea that one individual can transition to another state is a crux of storytelling. 
As a narrative studies major, I live and breathe storytelling. Whenever they hear about my major, most people ask me what exactly narrative studies is. Sometimes, as I await the question that I know will come, I wish that I had chosen to major in something more self-explanatory. 
Then, I realize that the process of explaining what my major is, in itself, is a kind of storytelling. I’m finding out more about myself and what I want from my major as I’m telling other people about it. Suddenly, I’m able to transform my major from something incomprehensible to something fascinating. 
Now, why am I talking about my major? It might just be the narrative studies in me speaking, but I see transformation as an incredibly powerful and symbolic cinematic device. In “Turning Red,” although the protagonist Meilin Lee is frightened by her red panda form, her red panda form actually becomes her source of teen rebellion and freedom. In “Luca,” although the main character Luca is initially intent on keeping his sea monster form a secret, he finds that being a sea monster doesn’t mean he has to be an outsider. 
In “Brave,” Princess Merida is forced to confront the fact that she’s turned her mother Queen Elinor into a bear after she makes a deal with a witch that Elinor will “change.” While a resentful and embittered Merida originally wanted her mother to “change” in becoming more acquiescent to Merida’s wishes, Elinor turns into a bear instead and begins to lose her humanity. “Brave” teaches us to question not only the costs and consequences of our wishes, but the boundaries between artificial and authentic change. The film does a great depiction of this throughout the story, by far the most emotional moment is when Merida thinks her mother’s humanity is lost and that she has become a bear. As the sun rises, Elinor becomes human again.
“You changed,” says a shocked Merida. “Oh, darling,” her mother responds affectionately. “We both have.” 
Even as we might hope that things will stay the same, change often marks the growth of a character and the fulfillment of a purpose. After all, all of these stories are about character journeys, which necessitate some kind of a transformation.
The “transformation” doesn’t even have to be an explicit means of becoming a whole other species. In “Ratatouille,” a film that I can easily and will most definitely talk about for hours, Remy is a rat who learns that being a rat doesn’t mean that he can’t also be a chef. The movie is about Remy overcoming that external stigma and the self-doubt of his ability to truly become who he aspires to be. 
Pixar’s animated films invite you to imagine your own narrative arcs, even if there aren’t carefully structured climaxes and resolutions. There’s something I love about that, and it’s why I chose to be a narrative studies major in the first place. 
Being invested in stories means visualizing transformations and being able to chart how they occur and what meaning they have to the plot. Studying stories about transformation gave me the tools to be part of my own.

Hold the front page, hold the back page. The United States Men’s National Team is going back to the World Cup. 
It was a long arduous journey, but on March 30, the U.S. qualified for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. You best believe I’m smiling ear to ear while writing that.   
I’m going to hold off from analyzing the U.S.’s electric World Cup group for the next edition of this column. Trust me, there will be plenty of necessary (and unnecessary) speculation in that piece, so stay tuned. 
For now, I think it’s appropriate to celebrate a bit. Let’s have an awards show! This column will make you feel like you’re at the Oscars — with a little less slapping. Without further ado, here are my awards for the USMNT’s qualifying cycle.
Most Valuable Player: winger Christian Pulisic
I promise my bias is not overtaking me, just let me explain. 
Christian Pulisic’s World Cup Qualifying cycle was far from perfect. He was hurt at the start, missing four games in total. He had a rough patch of form in the second-to-last window where he was trying to play hero-ball and force the issue. It wasn’t always sunshine and rainbows. 
But who scored the go-ahead goal against Mexico at home? Who had a hat trick in the crucial match against Panama at home? Who led the team in goals scored? That’s right, Pulisic. He’s the big game player, the guy opposing teams scramble to try and suppress, the guy that simply finds a way. This window showed us his inevitability; he’s going to make an impact no matter what you throw at him.
He’s the man in the mirror for a reason. He is Captain America, and he will lead this U.S. team into the World Cup. 
I will say this — Weston McKennie would’ve been a shoe-in for this award if not for his early team suspension drama and his late injury. His midfield play was next level in just about every way, and the U.S. had so much more going for it with him on the pitch.  
Honorable mentions: McKennie, Antonee Robinson
Breakout Star: defender Antonee Robinson 
This award was probably the easiest to decide on. Antonee Robinson had himself a window, playing his way into the starting lineup and cementing his name as a must-start heading into the World Cup.
How did he do it? It starts with his energy. I wouldn’t be surprised if news broke that he’s secretly a robot with infinite stamina. His role as an attacking full back was one of the most demanding in the team, and he took it on his chest. He played more minutes — 1,060 — than any other player on the team during the cycle. 
He was also incredibly timely. His goal contributions came at huge moments: tying the game away at Honduras, taking the lead at home against El Salvador, 2 assists in the all-important Panama home game. 
Robinson was always available, always working and always clutch. What more could you ask for?
Honorable mentions: Brenden Aaronson, Ricardo Pepi 
Mr. Consistency: defensive midfielder Tyler Adams
The CONCACAF Ironman, Tyler Adams played 1,022 minutes during the cycle, the second most on the team. He anchored the midfield, cleaned up the mess and did it all while staying healthy. He was a huge part of the team’s success, even without a goal contribution to his name. 
Adams makes all of the not-so-flashy plays — the last-ditch tackles, the compact passes — that keep the team afloat. He’s physically imposing, even in his 5-foot-8 frame, and he brings a sense of calm to the midfield. No matter who’s running on the counter attack, if Adams is following in pursuit, I’m not stressing. 
Honorable mentions: Timothy Weah, Yunus Musah
Adam’s Apology Award: goalkeeper Matt Turner, defender Walker Zimmerman 
This award goes to two players who I have doubted in the past, but who have delivered and earned my respect over the course of the cycle. 
Matt Turner was forced into the starting role due to first-team keeper Zach Steffen’s injuries. He looked solid in the role for eight appearances, but I wasn’t completely sold. In an earlier column, I said Steffen was my preference for the No. 1 keeper spot. Turner responded by securing a move to Arsenal and continuing his good form. Steffen, on the other hand, looks debatably healthy and had a very shaky final three games. Matt, I took you for granted, and I’m sorry. Moving forward, I’m officially Team Turner. 
Next is Walker Zimmerman. My European bias got the best of me here. Zimmerman’s MLS status led me to think he was just another technically shaky, physicality-reliant center back who would cost the U.S. against skilled attackers. He really did prove me wrong. On top of his strength, he’s composed at the back and is a threat in the air on set pieces. He also had 1 goal and 2 assists during the cycle, more direct contributions than some attackers on the team. Walker, I’m sorry for doubting you, and your man-bun is beautiful. 
Honorable mention: Paul Arriola. I still have to kiss a desk in Annenberg for his goal against Panama (don’t ask).
Thank you for your attendance at this illustrious award ceremony. It brings me immense joy to highlight these impactful performers who have helped the U.S. return to the glory that is the World Cup. Especially given the failure to qualify in 2017, I appreciate the ability to revel in this team’s temporary success. See you in Qatar.

After a series sweep against San José State last weekend and a Monday night loss to Hawaii, USC will square off against Oregon State for a three-game series this weekend.
The 17-9 Trojans have yet to play the Beavers, but last year’s squad dropped the season series 1-2 in Corvallis. USC will host this year’s matchup, looking to ride its 13-6 record at Dedeaux Field into a series victory.
Oregon State has earned a 21-7 record on the season. Per NCAA, the Beavers boast the fifth-best squad in the nation and have peaked as high as No. 3. 
The Trojans’ victories on Friday and Saturday night against San José State came as a result of late-inning heroics from USC’s offense. However, Monday night’s loss to the Rainbow Warriors showed the opposite story, as the Trojans blew a 2-run lead in the fifth inning before falling behind in the top of the sixth.
“There’s some areas last night on the mound that we didn’t do great at,” said Head Coach Jason Gill in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “I’m sure that we’ll get to work in that bullpen and try to make some adjustments before Friday.” 
This series will mark the halfway point in the regular season for the Trojans. At this point, the squad has amassed a collective .803 OPS and 4.31 ERA, with both stats besting last season’s marks. 
Gill laid out his team’s aspirations for the second half of the season, as the team vies for a playoff berth.
“Baseball is baseball, it’s difficult to do day in and day out. I think that’s part of the lessons that we’re learning,” Gill said. “In the second half, we’re looking to finish in the top four or five in the conference. We’ve got our work cut out for us.”
Oregon State’s bats are its main calling card. The Beavers score 9.0 runs per game on average, which leads the Pac-12 and is the 15th-highest average across all of Division 1. OSU’s slugging percentage and stolen base rates are also among the top of the conference, making up a dynamic offense.
OSU’s pitching staff places second in the conference in strikeout-to-walk ratio, while the defense boasts the Pac-12’s highest fielding percentage.
“That’s why they’re one of the best teams in the country. Very well balanced offensively, defensively, and on the mound,” Gill said.
Despite a loss to out-of-conference Hawaii on Monday night, the Trojans are 3-1 over the past four games and have scored 6 runs or more per game over that stretch. The recent hot stretch is thanks to Pac-12 player of the week Trevor Halsema and redshirt sophomores Adrian Colon-Rosado and Tyresse Turner — with 1.042 and .916 OPS, respectively. The staff ace, redshirt senior Isaac Esqueda, recently returned from injury and should be able to put his starting-pitcher leading ERA of 1.35 to good use.
With three practice days available between games, the Trojans have time to recalibrate from Monday’s loss and focus on what brought them success up to this point. Gill said he believes the squad’s practice this week could prove a huge indicator of the team’s performance on the field this weekend.
“You have to play good baseball: Throw quality strikes, can’t give free bases up on defense, you gotta put the ball in play with authority and make defenses work and you gotta run the bases intelligently,” Gill said. “That’s what we’re gonna focus on because that’s what we try to do in our practice sessions, and that’s what we’re trying to do in our games.”
Despite playing the role of David against the Pac-12’s very own Goliath, Gill said he believes the ballclub has just as much of a chance as anyone.
“When our lineup goes out there to compete against the opponent, we’ve shown that we can play with anybody in the country,” Gill said. “We need to continue to focus on that and work on that.”
The No. 5 Beavers will serve as a challenge for the unranked Trojans. The teams will face off Friday at 6 p.m. at Dedeaux Field.

As the weather warms up, people are likely to update their wardrobes for the spring and summer seasons. For an affordable wardrobe update, many college students will turn to clothing websites like SHEIN, one of many fast fashion brands, to keep up with seasonal trends. In the simplest of terms, fast fashion refers to brands that produce low-quality, not made-to-last clothing at a fast pace to keep up with ever-changing trends. At these clothing stores, customers can find an entire outfit for under $30. 
Vox writer Terry Nguyen writes in their article, “SHEIN is the future of fast fashion. Is that a good thing? A shopper can browse for tops under $5.99, dresses under $9.99 and clearance items under $5. The wardrobe possibilities, it seems, are endless.” However, regardless of its tempting affordability and trendy clothing, it is beyond time to ditch fast fashion and start shopping sustainably.
With fashion trends constantly changing, brands are relentlessly competing with each other to produce the latest trends the fastest, leading to the fast fashion industry we know today. These “trendy” products are often made from very cheap materials that are likely to spend more time decaying in a landfill than hanging in our closets. While these pieces quickly become unwearable, both literally and fashionably, they take years to decay, inflicting significant harm upon our environment.
Over the past few years, SHEIN has quickly become one of the most popular online-only shopping sites, coming out with huge new drops of trendy clothing every week and wooing people with their terrifically low prices. According to the Impakter article “Fast Fashion’s Detrimental Effect on the Environment,” the fashion industry is estimated to be responsible for 4% of the world’s greenhouse-gas emissions. 
According to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, “total greenhouse gas emissions from textiles production, at 1.2 billion tonnes annually, are more than those of all international flights and maritime shipping combined.”
Social media has been a direct culprit in funding the idea of fast fashion. Instagram, in particular, has created a taboo around wearing the same outfit twice in photographs and therefore promotes excessive consumption. Fashion hauls are often on TikTok and YouTube –– where a person showcases and reviews a large number of items. But young viewers are unaware of the dangers of fast fashion as these excessive hauls put out by notable influencers and celebrities are changing the way people value clothing.
The Atlantic writer Rachel Monroe states that, “Young people, and young women in particular, came to feel an unspoken obligation not to repeat an #outfitoftheday; according to a 2017 poll, 41 percent of women ages 18 to 25 felt pressure to wear a different outfit every time they went out.” Additionally, the affordability of fast fashion clothing appeals to teens and college students who often work minimum wage jobs, and it is the sad truth that clothing that is both trendy and sustainable tends to be more expensive. 
When faced with the dilemma of keeping up with the latest trends and avoiding wearing the same outfit twice, SHEIN and other fast fashion brands may seem like a great way to get more for your money, but what happened to quality over quantity? 
The issues of fast fashion do not stop at poor quality and environmental harm. From child labor law violations to stolen designs, companies like SHEIN must be stopped. A 2018 United States Department of Labor report found evidence of forced and child labor, specifically in the fashion industry, in countries including Argentina, Philippines and Vietnam. Brands like SHEIN lack transparency about their production and supply chain, further causing suspicion of their practices. 
It is up to consumers to boycott fast fashion. However, while this might prove challenging, it does not necessarily mean that we can’t keep up with trends sustainably. Instead of turning to fast-fashion retailers, try thrifting for an equally affordable shopping experience. Los Angeles is a great place to thrift and find trendy new and used clothing. There are also online thrift stores like ThredUp which make for a convenient experience. Support small artists and local businesses and break the taboo of “outfit repeating” by embracing wearing the same outfit twice. There’s no shame in wearing an outfit twice, especially when you can spice it up with a few accessories.
While social media has brainwashed society into thinking more is better, there is no pride in being wasteful. At the end of the day, the trendy and cheap clothing that fast fashion industries produce is not enough to justify the immense damage it is causing to our society. So, if you’re looking to transform your closet, transform your mindset on fashion first.

When it comes to alcohol, the law stands as a barrier that often fails to prevent its avid and passionate demographic from consuming it — think 1920s Prohibition. 
The same could be said about college students. 
Whether it be pregaming before a tailgate or drinking jungle juice from red Solo cups at fraternity parties, drinking culture permeates most college campuses to the point of becoming a defining characteristic of the so-called “college experience.” Whether to get tipsy to experience something new or to get drunk for fun, college students drink for a variety of reasons, and more often than not, their consumption reaches alarming amounts. 
Despite regulations on campus that attempt to keep USC a drug-free environment for the safety and wellness of students and faculty, alcohol frequently makes its way into the hands of college students, especially underage students like freshmen who feel the additional pressure that comes with assimilating to a new environment. 
Though participating in drinking culture while underage is a separate issue of its own, an arguably greater issue pertains to the heavy amounts of alcohol that college students consume. 
In terms of consumption, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism cited a study stating that “almost 53 percent of full-time college students ages 18 to 22 drank alcohol in the past month and about 33 percent engaged in binge drinking during that same time frame.” 
The issue with drinking in college is its perception as a rite of passage. It is a ritualistic endeavor that marks the beginnings of adulthood away from home, serving as an act of rebellion contrasting the more regulated days of high school. 
While doing anything in moderation can be safe and fun, alcohol is rarely moderate in college. 
What is even worse is the normalization of binge drinking that occurs on college campuses. This normalization allows the flourishing of what can be considered a huge public health crisis, allowing many habits of severe health issues to blend in with normalcy. 
In other words, the current culture of drinking in college allows for covert alcoholism to run rampant in broad daylight.
The University continues to aggravate this already-existing issue with its tendency to turn a blind eye to the crisis of alcohol overconsumption. Though USC labels itself as a dry campus, the school acknowledges the presence of alcohol, mainly at on-campus tailgates during football games. 
Though the general public is relatively well-informed on the individual health concerns arising from alcohol consumption, there are a variety of other risks associated with heavy drinking. Statistics chronicle the damages done at the community level when students binge alcohol, such as property damage, sexual assault and death at its extremes. 
The consequences of binge drinking even creep into academic settings. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, one in four college students have academic problems associated with drinking too often. 
Even if students can identify — if at all — their personal binge drinking habits, the University should improve in their capabilities of assisting students in recovery. 
In order to counteract the prevalence of binge drinking on college campuses, the root issues fueling collegiate drinking culture must be addressed. 
The reasons for binge drinking among college students are varied, but can be narrowed down to common motivations such as increased social pressure from peers and academic-related stress. 
One thing USC can and should do is aim to improve greater therapy services to its students to help with mental health issues that may arise from academics or peer pressure. Currently, USC offers extremely minimal services for mental health, such as therapy services at the Engemann and Eric Cohen Student Health Centers. However, students can only book consultation appointments to meet with a counselor four to eight times, diminishing the effectiveness of the University’s therapy treatments, as long-term therapy typically helps get to the root of the issue much more effectively than short-term sessions. 
As college students enter this new chapter in their lives — usually independent and away from their homes — they get their first taste of freedom and autonomy. Avoiding alcohol altogether becomes difficult with desires to assimilate into the college lifestyle. 
Rather than banning alcohol altogether and brushing the issue under the rug, USC should acknowledge its deep history and presence on campus and address the primary causes that fuel the invisible epidemic. 
After all, with what history has demonstrated, ignorance and banishment will only allow the issue to fester, silently growing in the shadows of the University.
