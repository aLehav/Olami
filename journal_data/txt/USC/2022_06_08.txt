The Undergraduate Student Government voted 7-5 to finalize the 2022-2023 budget, reallocating green engagement and accessibility fund dollars to the Legislative Fund Tuesday night. More than 20 students, including leadership from the Environmental Student Assembly and the SC Garden Club, attended the virtual meeting to oppose the reallocation and demonstrate support for the GEF.
Chief financial officer Brian Stowe and vice president Nivea Krishnan said the reallocation would further USG’s vision of equity and accessibility by streamlining and standardizing the funding process. However, ESA, SC Garden Club and other stakeholders argued reallocating the GEF would undermine sustainability initiatives at the University. 
At last Tuesday’s senate meeting, USG approved a bylaw amendment that cut the GEF from the funding department. Approval of the budget finalized the reallocation of GEF dollars to the Legislative Fund, which is available for senators, USG legislative committees and liasons to use for various projects. 
After last week’s meeting, the ESA and the SC Garden Club rallied to spread awareness of the issue and gather support for reinstating the GEF. 
Connor Castillo, the co-director of the Environmental Student Assembly, said USG had not informed the organization about the cut and the first time he became aware of the decision was shortly before last week’s meeting. He said the GEF directors, the GEF oversight board, SC Garden Club and other student projects approved for GEF funding were also not informed of the decision. 
“It felt very disappointing, especially because most of these senators, as well as the current president and vice president, they made campaigns on promoting sustainability as well as promoting student voices, promoting students and these types of conversations in terms of what is funded and what is not funded,” Castillo said.
Castillo launched a petition Sunday night calling for support for GEF. By Tuesday’s senate meeting, the petition had 317 signatures from incoming and current students, alumni, community members, staff and faculty. At the time of publication, the petition had garnered 321 signatures.
“Our students need continuing financial support to get their sustainability ideas off the ground, and our students and faculty really want sustainability to be supported as a core value at USC. It would be a shame for USG to pull funding for this critical program,” said Jill Sohm, environmental studies program director and associate professor of environmental studies, as quoted in the petition. 
After SC Garden Club president Olivia Heffernan was informed of the decision Friday night, she reached out individually to each senator to discuss the issue.
“I was really disappointed with a lack of transparency within this administration,” said Heffernan, a rising senior majoring in environmental studies, in an interview with the Daily Trojan after the meeting. “I’m hoping that they can do better in the future and that we can take this as a lesson going forward and really work on that so they can support their RSOs and student body better going forward.”
Throughout the meeting, several students’ Zoom profiles displayed the message, “Support The GEF.”
In the open forum at the start of the meeting, the ESA co-directors, SC Garden Club president and a GEF director spoke in support of the GEF. 
Castillo discussed the University administration’s prioritization of sustainability, as well as past campus initiatives funded by the GEF, including solar umbrellas at the Ronald Tutor Campus Center, native plants at Queen’s Courtyard and the sustainable garden at the Wrigley Institute. 
“The Green Engagement Fund in the past has supported our shared value of environmentalism at USC,” Castillo said. “Without this fund, students would not have an inclusive, accessible way to drive these initiatives in the future to promote sustainability.”
Castillo said reallocating the Green Engagement Fund would also set USC behind peer institutions like UCLA, where a budget is allocated for student-run sustainability projects. 
Emy Li, the funding director of the GEF in Spring 2022 and a rising junior majoring in applied and computational mathematics and economics, spoke about students’ use of and engagement with the fund. She addressed the concern that GEF funds were not being demanded or used effectively, noting that in the spring 2022 semester, while GEF’s oversight committee conducted eight consultations and approved six applications for funding, the projects did not receive the funds they requested.
“We all thought that the funds have been well on their way for the student projects, and the teams were really eager to receive funding and continue with their research and all their work,” Li said. “We learned after the school year ended that the funding was never distributed.”
Valerie Kuo, the co-director of ESA and a rising sophomore majoring in environmental studies, argued that reallocating the GEF would weaken support for sustainability projects on campus. Students who would have applied to receive GEF funding would now compete with committees for legislative funds.
Following the open forum, the senate debated the GEF further. The USG reemphasized its vision to further equity and accessibility by streamlining the funding process and standardizing it for all students who require funding for their projects. 
“Two things were on our mind going about this decision: equity and accessibility, fairness and equal access to all students to receive funding,” Stowe said. 
Vice president Nivea Krishnan clarified that students with sustainability projects can still receive funding and can do so by reaching out to senators and attending public-facing senate and committee meetings. Previous projects successfully funded through this process included the distribution of fentanyl test strips by registered student organization Team Awareness Combating Overdose and an art therapy event organized by the Survivor Support Community, Krishnan said.
“That [funding] process that has been tried and tested last year, and it’s how we were fortunate to be able to fund so many projects last year, which I’m personally grateful for because I think [funding projects was] one of the most powerful things that we did as the senate,” Krishnan said.
USG emphasized that the fund’s reallocation does not reflect on its commitment to sustainability.
President Hannah Woodworth also spoke about a project she and Krishnan are working on to create a shuttle that would provide transportation between the University and Los Angeles International Airport. The initiative was approved for $60,000 in funding last week and will be the largest USC sustainability initiative in years, she said. 
“I feel like that provides ample support for how we support sustainability, to prove that we are dedicated to this as a general issue regarding environmental justice, environmental equity and sustainability in general,” Woodworth said. “We will keep reiterating that [sustainability is] definitely at the forefront of our priorities.”
After the budget approval, USG unanimously confirmed the Latinx Student Assembly director nominations, which had been accidentally omitted from the previous meeting’s programming department nominations. The senators also unanimously approved new associate justices and the funding department leadership.
The meeting ended with a discussion in which USG members encouraged students attending the meeting to engage with USG for better understanding and support for sustainability. 
“Please give us more insight,” USG senator Victor Ye said. “Please come to us for more information, more support, as we are going to be working diligently on this over the next year. So there’s a lot for us to do and we are very excited to be a part of this journey with you guys.”
Tuesday’s meeting marked USG’s second and final intersemester meeting before reconvening in the fall.

Wildfires in the American West have, throughout the 21st century, transitioned from a seasonal affair to a year-round hazard. Seven of the 20 deadliest wildfires in California happened in the last five years, and 2020 saw the 1-million-acre Dixie fire — the second-largest in state history. The Daily Trojan spoke with USC experts on the exacerbating effects of climate change and drought on the impacts of wildfires, wildfires’ effects on human health and ways to improve wildfire mitigation.
Rebecca Miller, a postdoctoral scholar at the Huntington-USC Institute on California and the West, described the current crisis as having stemmed from previous flawed approaches to wildfire mitigation.
“Right now in California, we have an overabundance of vegetation, which stems from historic wildfire suppression policy,” Miller said. “These wildfire suppression policies, which dominated much of the 20th century, stemmed from the erroneous idea that fire was bad for ecosystems, that it was actually detrimental to their health. But now, of course, we recognize that fire is actually an integral part of California’s ecosystems: these ecosystems evolved over millennia to coexist [with] and often rely on fire.”
Indigenous populations, having known this for millennia, had conducted prescribed burns — wherein undergrowth would be burned under controlled circumstances — before they were outlawed in the early 20th century. Now, Miller said, California is adopting prescribed burns back into its suppression policy.
“What California is doing is it’s trying to increase fuel treatments, which are efforts to reduce the overvegetation that we’ve got, based on these historic wildfire suppression policies that didn’t allow us to remove some of that undergrowth over decades,” Miller said.
William Deverell, director of the ICW and professor of history, spatial science and environmental studies, acknowledged a need to “hold in higher regard and partner with” Indigenous groups to reinstate prescribed burns. 
“We’re learning a lot from Indigenous people, whose prescribed burning practices were largely squeezed out from them by successive waves of conquest in the American West,” Deverell said. “We need to pay attention to them and collaborate with them.”
Such collaboration is part of the work conducted at the ICW, Deverell said, particularly through their project The West on Fire.
“We received a grant [from the Sierra Nevada Conservancy] to superintend four prescribed burns of forest properties; some are tribal and some are private,” Deverell said. “We have tribal partners in the southern Sierra, and we’re also working with a Girl Scout ranch.” 
The project will train tribal youth in the certification process to conduct prescribed burns, Deverell said. The burns will take place near the end of 2022, depending on weather conditions.
Among the other work conducted by the ICW are courses on Western wildland fire at the Dornsife College of Arts, Letters and Sciences, archivals of documented and oral history, and a six-episode podcast hosted by Deverell entitled “The West On Fire.”
“There’s a long one on Smokey Bear: What is this thing, and why has it so captured the imagination of people across American history for about 75 years?” Deverell said. “We also talked to formerly incarcerated people who became firefighters and, as a consequence, got their sentences either reduced or [had their] record expunged. We talked to public health physicians over at [the Keck School of Medicine] who study Western wildland fire smoke, and how dangerous that is for people with respiratory and pulmonary trouble.”
The Daily Trojan spoke to one such expert interviewed for the podcast — Ed Avol, a professor of clinical population and public health sciences at Keck — regarding the health effects of wildfires.
“One subtlety that many people don’t appreciate is it doesn’t have to be close for it to have effects on you,” Avol said. “What we’ve seen, certainly in the last few years, is that wildfire smoke can travel hundreds, if not thousands, of miles, and affects people and populations many, many miles away from the initial location of the fire itself.”
Avol categorized effects into short-term and long-term.
“In the short term, we begin with the respiratory effects: there’s the eye irritation, there’s the smoke, the smell, the respiratory inflammation and difficulty breathing because of the concentration of gasses and particles in there,” Avol said. “The problem is that, in some ways, people might think of wildfire smoke as being generic … In fact, of course, depending on what’s burning, what is in the smoke can be very, very different.”
These effects are “more than additive” in the midst of the current pandemic, Avol said, given that the coronavirus also causes respiratory illness.
“If you’re in an area with poor air quality, or it’s a wildfire situation, and you are exposed to COVID, chances are … there’ll be a heightened response,” Avol said. “It’s like one plus one equals three or four; it doesn’t equal two, so it becomes more problematic. And there’s a number of studies that have been published, and a number of studies underway, that make clear that the combined effects of pollution and COVID are probably eight to 10% or higher.”
In the long term, Avol described effects beyond the respiratory system.
“Repeated exposures, or changes in the body’s response, to [wildfire smoke] can affect your metabolism, can affect your function, can affect your ability,” Avol said. “There are some suggestions, because of the small size of the particles, that there could even be neurological or central nervous system effects.”
Avol also noted detriments to mental and psychological health, including anxiety and depression, whether due to displacement by evacuation or exposure to wildfire pollution.
“There have been occasions where the skies had been orange or red, and you can definitely smell the smoke in the air, and it just seems eerie and almost unnatural. For many people, this is stress-inducing — makes it difficult for them to sleep, difficult for them to carry on with their normal activities … [they] start to question their own health,” Avol said. “[It’s] a whole other level of anxiety if you actually have to evacuate your home and even another level if you have to do it on very short notice.”
To prevent smoke exposure, Avol recommended remaining indoors and blocking outside air but noted that such actions contradict coronavirus concerns.
“From a COVID perspective, being inside an enclosed space is exactly what you don’t want to do; you want to increase the ventilation, you want to increase the air exchange, you want more outdoor air to dilute what’s indoors … If you’re trying to do both these things, they’re sort of competing and contradictory,” Avol said. “You can’t get too wound up in this. I think you have to be a little realistic: if you’re not infected with COVID, and you’re not sheltering in place with many other people for whom you don’t know what their health status is, then you deal with the primary insult, which is the outdoor wildfire smoke.”
In the long term, Deverell emphasized the importance of continuing “an urgent conversation about fire.”
“I’d love to say [the ICW] has some impact on wildlife reduction; I think that’s probably too ambitious for a relatively small humanities outfit,” Deverell said. “But I do think we’ve contributed to a wider-ranging conversation about Western fire that takes history seriously, and then makes connections across disciplines through all kinds of ways in which the public can interface with us.”
Miller listed a “number of different barriers” that still remain against prescribed burns. In 2020, Miller co-authored a paper published by Nature Sustainability detailing the barriers for prescribed burns, such as private landowners, who fear they would be held liable for unintentional damages caused by prescribed burns gone rogue. 
“The California legislature, in recognition of the risk that private landowners are placing themselves in when it comes to these potential liability concerns, has recently passed laws which have changed the type of liability that private landowners would be subject to,” Miller said. “The idea is that it lessens that fear of liability and financial loss when doing a prescribed burn.”
In their paper, Miller et al. cited negative public opinion, limited federal funding, limited federal training or certification programmes, weather conditions, inadequate firefighter availability and environmental regulations as additional barriers — based on interviews with government employees, state legislative staff, nonprofit representatives and academics.
Regardless, Miller noted the progress made, saying that people “have a pretty solid understanding at this point” of wildfires and their effects.
“Fire is not something that happens in the summer or the fall anymore; it seems to be happening all the time,” Miller said. “People across the state are just more aware of these events because how could you not be? They’re happening every single year. People are paying attention to their risks, and they’re paying attention to what they need to do to better protect themselves.”

Amid rising coronavirus case counts in Los Angeles County, the University continues to observe health conditions through regular meetings with the L.A. County Department of Public Health, said Student Health Co-Medical Director Dr. Kimberly Tilley in a briefing with the Daily Trojan Monday. Between May 29 and June 4, the University recorded 126 positive coronavirus tests among students and 14 among staff, resulting in positivity rates of 13.5% and 3.0%, respectively. There are currently 195 students in isolation and 47 isolation spots still available. 
Student Health does not have a definite plan for how testing, masking and other coronavirus regulations will function during the fall 2022 semester, Tilley said, but recommends the continued use of masks indoors. 
“Even without a mandate at this point, with the level of spread, if you’re in an indoor enclosed space with other people, it would be prudent to wear a good fitting mask,” Tilley said. 
The implementation of surveillance testing depends on the types of variants and the hospitalization rates in L.A. County, Tilley said. Testing will be supplemented with mandated coronavirus vaccinations for staff and students to mitigate community transmission. Coronavirus vaccinations will join the myriad of USC-mandated vaccinations for measles, mumps and varicella.
“For students returning in the fall, or students that are newly starting in the fall, just like they need to submit documentation of those other childhood vaccinations, they are going to need to submit documentation that they have completed their COVID series,” Tilley said.
A third dose — also referred to as a booster shot — was required for all eligible faculty, staff and students following the return from winter break to in-person learning with a deadline of January 30. Students who had not completed their vaccination series without an approved exemption despite being eligible to do so were required to test twice weekly after the University lifted the surveillance testing requirement for boosted students. 
Regarding summer programs, Student Health remains vigilant of changing coronavirus conditions and, Tilley said, will adjust operations and procedures as necessary. The varying infection rates and restrictions mandated by L.A. County, she said, create conditions that can change at a moment’s notice.
“What we’ve learned in this pandemic is that things change and so, at the moment, the summer semester with the current level of cases [is] offering in-person classes very similar to what we did in the spring,” Tilley said.
Tilley also highlighted important measures for returning and incoming students to take into account, including getting a third dose of a vaccine — the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and boosters are recommended only to those who have had a severe reaction to Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, who don’t have access to Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or want to take the J&J vaccine despite safety concerns — over the summer. Tilley also recommends investing into quality masks to heighten protection from the virus. 
“It’s a good time to invest and buy,” Tilley said. “There’s lots of different masks out there. Find one that fits you well, that’s comfortable, that you can wear in an indoor environment and be prepared when you’re in that indoor environment.” 
Tilley suggests that individuals at a higher risk — those above the age of 65 or who have underlying health problems — have a plan for obtaining postviral medications, such as Paxlovid, for greater protection from infection.
“You would need to just have a relationship with a primary care provider or know where those tests and treat sites are,” Tilley said. “If you are eligible for [postviral medications], get your diagnosis in a timely manner and access to the medication in a timely manner.”
As the Engemann Student Health Center no longer offers coronavirus vaccines, students and staff can receive doses administered at the USC Pharmacies or local pharmacies. Currently, only certain immunocompromised individuals and those over the age of 50 who received their first booster at least four months ago are eligible for a second mRNA booster. 
PCR tests will become a standard for the University’s testing program, Tilley said, because they are more sensitive than at-home tests and provide additional information on sourcing the diverse array of variants. 
“From a PCR test, we actually can get a suggestion of what variant it was by the pattern that it looks at,” Tilley said. “There’s definitely a role for an at-home test, clearly in terms of availability, so I think there’s a role for both.”
The steps students and staff can take to prepare and protect themselves ahead of the fall 2022 semester, Tilley said, is to make sure they’re fully vaccinated, invest in high quality masks and check whether they meet the requirements to receive postviral medication.

There is no one answer for what Contains: Eggs exactly is: a multimedia team, an innovative music video and concert hub or simply a passionate group of friends. 
“[Contains: Eggs is] a group of people that believes in the quality of innovating what music videos can and should look like, and whenever we have an opportunity that gives us the potential to do that, we pursue it,” said William Higbie, a rising senior majoring in cinema and media studies and the group’s producer.  
Contains: Eggs was originally founded in 2019 by rising seniors Shantanu Jhaveri and Joel Yoon, who said the group’s name was inspired by their friend and musician Sumit shaving his head bald, which “looked like an egg” and inclined them to “make something.” 
At the time of the group’s creation, Jhaveri and Yoon were freshmen and excited to start projects but found it hard for people to take them seriously as first-year students. This passion, combined with their desire to collaborate on projects with other students, sparked what would become a space where anyone with an idea for a project had the ability to come and work on things together. 
“[Yoon] came from a very traditional storytelling background, and I came from a traditional engineering background,” said Jhaveri, who is majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation and computer science. “If you see any of our videos, we try to do some technically captivating things. If we do anything technical, we want to try to capture some element of storytelling, or some level of art behind it, so that’s how we kind of came up with this cool collaboration between us.”
With Yoon, who is majoring in arts, technology and the business of innovation, and Jhaveri, Sumit and Higbie make up the core of Contains: Eggs.  
One of the major projects pursued by the team was TinyDorm, an event where musicians perform in an intimate college dorm room. All of the team members agree that TinyDorm has come a long way since its first rendition in 2020. 
“That first one was so chaotic because we had never done it before. We were all running around,” Yoon said. “We did it in McCarthy [Residential College], and there was still a guest policy at McCarthy. You could only bring two people up. We were trying to put like around 90 people into that dorm that night. It was like three groups of 30, rotating out. It was very janky.” Since then, TinyDorm events are now filmed, and have evolved to include 3D printed tickets and a partnership with student-run traveling coffee shop Cup of Troy. 
In addition to their work on music videos and putting on tiny concerts, Contains: Eggs also works on “bold tech,” such as projection mapping, a projection technique used to turn objects, often irregularly shaped, into display surfaces for video projection. 
“We like introducing fun little concepts that people don’t really see before,” Sumit said. “For instance, projection mapping in a dorm room is something no one had ever seen. Then we have these [wooden] tickets that we would burn to mark people’s drinks. We had [3D printed] physical tickets for each person. We use the tools we have to make the experience a lot more engaging.”
As Contains: Eggs grows older, there is even more of an emphasis for projects to feel polished, a desire for things to look better than anyone else they are competing with. 
“We want you to pay like $20 for a $100 experience. It should be done to the point where you’re surprised that college students were able to put this together with absolutely no budget or funding but simply because they want to do it,” Jhaveri said. “Anything we do, anything we build, we want it to feel like magic.” 
An integral part of the magic are the musicians who Contains: Eggs work with, whether on their music videos or inviting them to perform.
“Very plainly, it was the creative control that they gave me, this vision they collaborated with me to help see through for the night, with the drinks and the lighting and the camera angles and what the idea was going to be behind it,” said Ethan Sak, a rising junior majoring in music production, of his performance last November. 
Sak performed at TinyDorm after his friend, who ran sound for Contains: Eggs in the past, recommended him for the gig. 
“As the people were shuffling in, you started to get a little bit more aware of just how close everybody was to each other, just how intimate it was. In my opinion, that or the biggest stage you can get are two of the best stages you can play.

Content warning: This article contains references to sexual assault.
Five years and one month removed from the release of “Damn,” Kendrick Lamar has shared his brilliance with the world yet again through his new album, “Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers.” The 18-track double LP is Lamar’s Top Dawg Entertainment swan song — the 14-time GRAMMY award winner has announced that he will be parting ways with the record label juggernaut — and in his final act, K-Dot undoubtedly sticks the landing. “Big Steppers” offers the perspective of an older and wiser Kendrick, willing to strip his mask and allow his audience a glimpse into the world he’s lived in over the past 1,855 days. Leaning on themes of authenticity, autonomy, masculinity and panentheism, Lamar unveils his struggles with his depression, relationships, writer’s block and more. 
Much has already been made of Kendrick Lamar’s return, deservedly so. The album has it all: sonically diverse and enthralling production, well-placed and intentional feature performances, culturally relevant and, at times, groundbreaking content and the perfectly chaotic flow that only the good kid from the m.A.A.d city can execute.
Only the test of time will determine what the final verdict will be on the latest addition to Oklama’s discography — however, as listeners will almost universally attest, the album has certainly stormed out of the starting blocks. 
Yet, in the midst of the honeymoon that audiences are currently embarking on with “Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers,” there has not been enough discussion regarding the central focus of the most profound song on the album: “Mother I Sober.” 
It is no coincidence that “Mother I Sober” is by far the longest of the 18 tracks featured on the project — Kendrick had a lot to say. Opening with a solemn piano melody amalgamated with the soft but firm thump of a kick drum, the somber tone of the song is evident at the outset — a stark contrast from the up beat tempo of the preceding “Mr. Morale.” The first line of “Mother I Sober” further crystalizes the lugubrious mood: “I’m sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody.” 
Upon the foundation of this expression of radical empathy, King Kendrick builds arguably the most compelling song he’s ever released. Featuring a euphonious chorus by the versatilely gifted Beth Gibbons, “Mother I Sober” takes its listeners on a journey through Lamar’s experiences with masculinity and sexuality. 
Beginning in his childhood, he speaks of the powerlessness he felt while witnessing his mother’s abuse, unable to come to her aid. Lamar outlines familial accusations of his cousin’s sexual abuse of him, despite his persistent insistence that nothing of the sort had ever occurred. Though it is later revealed that Lamar’s mother was projecting this victimhood onto him, as she had suffered abuse of this nature earlier in her own life, the psychological toll that these speculations took on young Kendrick led to his feeling pressured to assert his manhood. Lamar alludes to his use of sex as an unhealthy coping mechanism in adulthood and the consequences that his actions had on his relationship with his fiancee and mother of his children, Whitney. 
In recording “Mother I Sober,” Kendrick Lamar stood toe-to-toe with some of his innermost demons — something he admits with the line, “Now I’m affected, 20 years later trauma has resurfaced / Amplified as I write this song, I shiver ‘cause I’m nervous.” We must applaud Lamar for this powerful display of vulnerability, as the release of this song serves as an invitation — a catalyst — for a long overdue discussion surrounding sexual trauma and healing, both in hip-hop and in the Black community, at large. 
Sexuality is not simply a vehicle of physical pleasure — what is physical is inherent to what is personal, which will always be directly correlated with the political. Conceptions of sex in many ways inform one’s understanding of oneself and one’s inherent value. As Anthony Giddens writes in his book on intimacy, “Sexuality is a terrain of fundamental political struggle and also a medium of emancipation … Emancipation thus presumes autonomy of action in the context of the generalization of plastic sexuality.” 
This is an autonomy that has been stripped from the Black community since its forced introduction to the United States. There is a long, traumatic, documented history of the sexual degradation of the Black body in the U.S., dating back to enslavement and persisting to this very day, as Kendrick Lamar alludes to in the song: “A conversation not bein’ addressed in Black families / The devastation, hauntin’ generations and humanity / They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters / Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other / Psychotic torture between our lives.” 
The objectification and commodification of the Black body is the defining motif of the Black experience. W.E.B. Du Bois’ concept of the double consciousness manifests itself palpably in this regard, as our understanding of our sexuality often is imposed through the eyes of others. It begins in childhood –– Black girls ogled and sexualized early into their teens by grown men, Black boys pressured to lean into the stereotype of their sexual prowess early and often, a desperate attempt to affirm their masculinity within the Western patriarchal hegemony — and continues well into adulthood, deeply affecting our relationships with ourselves and with each other. 
Whether through abuse, addiction, projections of queerphobia or even general confusion and insecurity, this is a generational trauma that has touched all of us in the Black community in some capacity at one point or another. It is certainly an ugly and uncomfortable truth but it is the truth nonetheless. But, as Lamar says, by and large, this is a reality that does not get addressed in our circles. When we speak of liberation for Black people, so much of the conversation centralizes changing external circumstances such as media representation, capital redistribution and interpersonal microaggressions — and while these issues certainly warrant space, far too often, we disregard the battles that we must fight within to decolonize centuries of internalized oppression. 
Collective sexual trauma may be the most poignant example of this inward struggle, hence why we have yet to truly grapple with the matter. Perhaps we don’t know that we need to, perhaps we don’t know how or perhaps we are just simply scared to go there.
In “Mother I Sober,” Kendrick Lamar, informed by his experiences and the experiences of those close to him around sex and sexuality, argues the contrary, breaking new ground in the hip-hop landscape by doing so. He asserts that we as Black people must go there: that we have no choice if we want to liberate ourselves of this generational trauma and that we will only continue to perpetuate a cycle of pain if we don’t address the elephant in the room. It may be the most profound message of Kendrick Lamar’s decorated career — a lesson that each of us must take to heart if we hope to set free our minds, our bodies and our souls.

Symbols are everywhere. From images and flags to slogans, physical depictions serve as visual representations of values and beliefs. 
The intersection between art and symbolism is especially interesting, as symbols add a deeper layer to the message of any piece of artwork. One medium in particular where symbols play a critical role is fashion, and one house which was heavily founded on symbols is Chanel. 
The camelia, the ribbon, the comet and the sun, the feather and the lion all are symbols of the House of Chanel. 
The lion in particular holds a deep meaning in Chanel fashion, serving as a representation of both Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel herself and a city she adored: Venice. 
Venice is known as the city of the lion. All across the city, winged lions can be seen adorning architecture and murals. It is so common that the exact number of lions throughout Venice remains a mystery.  
The history of the lion in Venice runs so strong that it can be dated back to the building of the Piazza San Marco, where the winged lion stands alone, high on a pillar looking outward. Yet, its prevalence remains to this day, as a more modern reference of the Venetian lion is its place as the official symbol of the Venice Film Festival. 
Just as modern films are rewarded with a golden lion at the film festival, the lion has punctuated Venetian art dating back centuries. Namely, Tintoretto’s painting “Venice, Queen of the Adriatic, Crowning the Lion of Saint Mark” is a direct statement of the value Venetians placed on the lion. This painting, dating back to 1597, depicts the crowning of the lion and directly establishes the power and majesty of the lion. 
Clearly, the lion has been, and continues to be, a central figure in Venice. In addition to majesty, its purpose is to represent power and uniqueness of identity.  
This meaning was especially deep to Coco Chanel, as she was once quoted saying, “I am a Leo and, like a lion, I use my claws to prevent people from doing me harm, but, believe me, I suffer more from scratching than from being scratched.”
Another figure who felt a deep connection to Venice and the lion was English poet Lord Byron.
In his poem “Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage (I Stood in Venice),” Byron also references Venice and the lion, saying: 
“Looked to the wingéd Lion’s marble piles, / Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles! … The pleasant place of all festivity, / The revel of the earth, the masque of Italy!”
Byron’s poem references the beauty of Venice in both its physicality and history. For a city where art reigns from music to architecture and painting, the richness of Venice’s history is another lifeline symbolized by the lasting presence of the lion.
The beauty of symbols is that one simple image can carry such an elaborate history behind it.
It’s ironic, however, that a symbol meant to represent uniqueness and individuality can also become a commonly referenced figure. Something so individual could go on to touch the lives of so many people. Something so anchored in the memory of the past could go on to decorate generations to come. 
It is no wonder that Coco Chanel, grieving the loss of the love of her life at the time of her trip to Venice, would choose to find inspiration and particularly associate herself with the strength, individuality and majesty of the lion. It is no wonder that Lord Byron, who lived in Venice from 1816 to 1819, found inspiration from a city so rich and full of hidden symbols, and chose to write about its fading history, despite its lasting beauty. 
That’s why symbols are so important — they act as a bridge between the past and the present. Moreso, they carry histories behind them while also allowing people to carve out new meanings. 
The lion, though sculpted in bronze and unmoving, still roars throughout Venice, serving as the same symbol it did centuries ago. And as countless artists have stood in the lion’s city marveling at its silent grandeur, the lion will continue to watch over Venice, holding the secrets of its past and the hope of its future.

Content warning: The following article contains mentions of mass shootings and gun violence.
On May 24, the mass shooting tragedy that devastated the community of Uvalde, Texas left 19 students and two teachers dead — labeled by the New York Times as The Uvalde 21. 
Only a few weeks prior, 10-year-old Makenna Lee Elrod — one of the 19 student victims — gave her friend Chloe a friendship bracelet at the ballpark. Another victim, Xavier Lopez, had recently made the honor roll, and 10-year-old Jayce Luevanos shared a daily routine of brewing coffee for his grandfather as he did every morning. 
Just a few days after the Uvalde shooting, eight more mass shootings embraced headlines in America. Though what happened in Texas has shocked the country, our current mindsets and practices have done nothing but continue to aggravate an issue deeply ingrained in our nation. 
Given this trend, Americans should expect a few more mass shootings in the next week. After all, with what statistics have shown, mass shootings have become a daily routine in our country. It’s a sad reality that should not exist.
The current political climate of America grapples with a depressing irony surrounding the ongoing debates that boil down to choosing life or death. However, what ultimately fuels these debates, and the deadly consequences that manifest as mass shootings across the country, is our culture of rugged individualism.
Rugged individualism has previously manifested itself with the debate surrounding vaccines during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, rugged individualism is defined as “the combination of individualism and anti-statism … a prominent feature of American culture with deep roots in the country’s history of frontier settlement.” Though individualism can be beneficial for being a resourceful and innovative quality, it can also go against collective action that is often required for national and global issues.
Likewise, gun violence — a problem whose solutions require a collectivist mindset — must be approached in a similarly collective manner. However, the endemic American individualist mindset does little to further these efforts. 
Rugged individualism is inherently selfish, egocentric and illogically rooted in an outdated Second Amendment. The dire need to fulfill one’s wishes of gun possession is uniquely American, defined by a cultural reasoning that lacks the prioritization of community safety. Rather than making small sacrifices and allowing for the proper enforcement of established rules, many extreme individualists would rather hold onto their rifles and guns (namely assault rifles such as AR-15s and AK-47s). 
As a result, self-serving politicians and gun advocates propose ridiculous and ineffective gun laws in order to do anything but give up their guns. For instance, many extremists believe in arming teachers to defend their students in the face of an active shooter on campus, a piece of legislation that is already under consideration in Ohio and Louisiana. 
Gun advocates and extremists also love to spew the narrative of the “good guy with a gun” as reasoning for gun ownership. However, this reasoning has proved to be a myth time and time again amid continued mass shootings. In Uvalde, armed officers were waiting outside the school for over an hour while the shooter was inside the building. In the meantime, an unarmed mother ran into Robb Elementary School to save her children while the police did nothing.
Another illogical solution proposed by Texas Republican politicians in the wake of Uvalde involved a one-door policy in schools; simply being, one entrance and exit within a school building with armed officers at the door in order to regulate those who step into the school. However, expert opinions disagree with these politicians, arguing that such solutions are not “grounded in reality,” as stated in the Texas Tribune. 
All of the above solutions do nothing to minimize mass shootings. Instead, they normalize mass shootings as events expected to occur and provide illogical means of what to do in these cases, which will only result in more victims. Republican politicians that vote against valid gun control laws would rather create a dystopian society of armed school entrances and teachers rather than implement realistic and viable solutions to gun control. 
Solutions grounded in expert opinion and proven to work time and time again in different nations should be the approach American politicians take in order to solve this national health crisis. Even if that means sacrificing our individualistic approaches that we deem so integral to the American experience, creating and enforcing preventative measures should be our first priority in keeping our nation safe. 
Sensible gun laws that reduce the number of rifles that end up in the hands of irresponsible or dangerous individuals must be implemented. While this seems simple, straightforward and viable, many politicians have voted against gun laws in the past while coincidentally accepting large donations from major gun corporations. In countries like Israel and Norway where gun ownership is common, there are also strict regulations on guns, resulting in much fewer gun-related homicides and mass shootings.
While it remains no secret that the National Rifle Association plays a powerful role in shifting American politics, politicians should rightly and obviously do the moral thing and choose to support the people, rather than powerful gun lobbies. Rather than allowing money to infiltrate politics, Americans must hold these corporations accountable for their influential actions.
For those in an uproar claiming their rights are being infringed upon, sit down and shut up. The Second Amendment states, “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” Emphasis on regulated. Gun control isn’t about denying access to firearms; it’s about protecting the community from unnecessary harm.
There have been over 240 mass shootings this year, and it is only June. With over 250 people killed and nearly 1,000 injured, how many more must die for us to take action?
While there are many effective and viable solutions that can be implemented, until Americans begin dropping the individualist mindset, compromises won’t come easily. While the ultimate goal is to reduce mass shootings and change America’s gun culture, we are also in desperate need for rugged individualism to fade. The time for community healing and collective action is now, before another national tragedy strikes.

One of my all-time favorite Instagram accounts is @barstoolusc. It’s one thing to go on my Explore page and see a video of a stranger swimming in a fountain, but when it’s a video of a bunch of fellow Trojans in Speedos splashing around in the Leavey Library reflection pool, it feels 10 times more special.
It’s a little difficult to properly explain @barstoolusc in a way that would make sense to someone who hasn’t seen it before, but it’s basically a public Instagram account that posts about school sports, campus news and features funny picture and video submissions from students at USC. The account has been active since October 2016, and today, over 36,000 people follow the page. It’s also not usual for the content on @barstoolusc to be lewd and crass, and even though all of its posts are about USC, the account itself isn’t affiliated with the University in any official way. 
Barstool USC is among several other “Barstool college accounts” that are directly affiliated with popular digital media company Barstool Sports and its “Barstool College Viceroy Program.” According to founder and former CEO of Barstool Sports David Portnoy, “Campus Viceroys … run [Barstool’s] campus Twitter accounts and post the best stuff that’s floating around campus on Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, etc in the name of the Stool … IE – smokes, parties, sports and anything else that a typical Stoolie needs to know about on campus. Funny, controversial, whatever.” 
For the record, I despise David Portnoy, but his quote sums it up pretty well. The pages aren’t about getting serious coverage on important school news; they mostly exist to provide people with some lighthearted college-related entertainment. 
In general, that’s what @barstoolusc has been doing beautifully all year. Especially this past January, when cases were up because of the Omicron variant and all of my friends and I were worried about classes going remote for the rest of the semester, being able to go to @barstoolusc and laugh with everyone else about Aidan Moriarty’s accidental Reply All was such a great way to escape from worrying about the future. 
Recently, though, instead of taking my mind away from upsetting things, @barstoolusc has uploaded some videos that just haven’t been sitting right with me. Toward the end of April, someone sent in a clip of two people making out at a frat party, and even though it was clear that neither of the people in the video knew that someone else was recording them, @uscbarstool still posted it for all 36,000 of their followers to see. Although that post was eventually taken down, it was up long enough for everyone to send it around, take screenshots and repost it to their own accounts.
More recently, on May 1, someone sent in a video of a student doing a workout in the Lyon Center, and, again, even though it was clear that the student in the video had no idea that someone was recording him, the admin of @barstoolusc put it up on the page anyways. 
In both scenarios, the person running the account posted these videos without getting permission from the people who were in them — which is an issue in itself, and clearly not OK. However, I have a much bigger issue with the fact that students at USC are recording and publicly embarrassing other people from our school without their knowledge or consent. Yes, it’s disappointing that @barstoolusc went ahead and shared these posts, but let’s not be mistaken — the USC “Viceroy” wasn’t the one who decided to violate another person’s privacy and take a secret recording of one of their classmates going about their day — that’s on the students who submitted these videos in the first place.
The people who were in these videos definitely didn’t ask to be put on blast and none of them deserved it either. After the first video went up, I heard people say things like, ‘If you don’t want someone to post a video of you hooking up with someone at a frat party, don’t hook up with someone at a frat party.’ Frankly, that line of thinking is absolutely ridiculous. This is college. People should be allowed to go to parties and have fun without worrying about it ending up online. And what about the second video? Are we going to start telling people that if they don’t want someone to take a video of them working out at the gym, they need to stop going altogether? 
Put yourselves in these people’s shoes. Imagine if you were minding your own business and using the cable machine at the rec center or enjoying your Friday afternoon out on the row, and you woke up the next day to see thousands of people laughing at you on the internet. Nobody deserves that. It’s just not right.
I’d like to call on all of us to go back to sending Barstool videos of ourselves and our friends having a good time at school — no more creepily recording strangers from far away in the distance. I don’t know about you, but nothing makes my day like watching a man willingly and enthusiastically drinking alcohol out of his dirty shoe, or seeing a video of a bunch of girls sneaking muffins out of the dining hall. We know we don’t need to rely on getting a laugh at the expense of a stranger, so let’s just go back to making @barstoolusc a fun place for everyone.

Every year, USC and other institutions across the United States award honorary doctorate degrees to individuals shaping the institution and academia. Although primarily useless, the degree is often tied to honoring renowned individuals who have transformed their field. 
USC, however, has a long history of awarding these degrees to people who have accumulated power and capital — particularly when that capital and power has benefited USC. People such as billionaire and former CEO of software company Oracle, Larry Ellison, and ex-chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, Charlie Beck, were awarded these degrees in 2016 and 2018, respectively. 
USC has continued this tradition in its 2022 graduation ceremony, honoring six people with degrees — four of whom are cisgender white men. Film producers Frank Price, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer were credited for their “efforts to expand industry inclusion,” and philanthropist David Bohnett was honored for “his commitment to ‘community building and social activism’” without further specification as to how any of them actually did so. Frank Price, as a member of the Board of Trustees, even approved his own honorary degree. 
When investigating the three producers who were awarded with a degree, it seems that just about every film that put these producers on the map features an all-white cast and has no large contribution to the visibility of any one group or community. These white men did not contribute anything to inclusion in the industry. They merely tapped into it to serve their best interests.
Looking at USC’s Honorary Degrees website, if you search the words “transgender,” “disabled” or “first-gen” on USC’s past honorary degree recipients, you will find “no matches.” If you search “Black,” you will find just five matches; “Asian” and “Native” have one each; “Latino” or “Latinx” have zero. Sadly, if you’re a freshly admitted student looking for representation in USC’s traditions, you won’t find much. 
While USC also honored two powerful women of color who broke endless barriers in their field this year, it was alongside four white men who did nothing for representation in their sphere of work, diluting the message.
Aside from the six people honored during commencement, USC also quietly made use of the degrees in correcting its problematic displacement of Japanese American students and their access to their USC education. Following the bombing of Pearl Harbor during World War II, former President Franklin Roosevelt’s 1942 Executive Order forced Japanese people living on the West Coast, including 120 first-generation Japanese American USC students, out of college and into internment camps. When the students returned to USC, the University not only denied them access to continue their degree plans but also prevented displaced students from gaining ownership of their college transcripts with hopes of transferring. Their education was indefinitely cut short on the basis of their ethnicity, and USC waited eight decades to acknowledge this relegation. 
But what was this so-called “acknowledgment?” It was simply 33 honorary degrees that hold no power or purpose for the students and have no Universitywide recognition.
USC’s displacement of Nisei students from their education created generational barriers that continue to go unaddressed by substantive measures. The descendants of the displaced Japanese American students then became first-generation college students themselves, with no opportunities for their parents to finish the education that they had started. This created a series of new obstacles and barriers to education, especially at USC, which — considering undergraduate expenses alone — is set to cost $340,000 without scholarships or financial aid. 
If USC and other institutions want to honor those who have supposedly bettered the world, they should put their money where their mouths are. They should stop celebrating white men under the guise of inclusion, and awardees should at least seek to create real change, for instance, funding full-tuition scholarships for financially burdened students who are making similar strides as the recipients in their community — for most honorees have more than enough resources to do so.
For the 33 Japanese students who were honored after their death, scholarships should be given to their children and grandchildren. These scholarships should be functional at any institution, debuting USC’s first pursuit of actually making education accessible — regardless of whether or not it benefits USC’s public image. 
Without reform, USC’s flimsy honorary degrees will continue to perpetuate a white-centered, heteronormative and exclusive campus culture.

Over the past two weeks, the Los Angeles Sparks players took turns proving they deserve the name on the front of their jersey. 
Following a roller coaster 2-5 start, the Sparks turned in much better results with a 3-1 record in their next four games. In each win, a different player has, well, “sparked” the victory. 
Every game has become a unique story with a different hero. It’s been compelling, fun and most importantly, successful.
This pattern started with the Sparks’ home game against the Phoenix Mercury, the team’s second home game of the year. It was tightly contested, with neither team pulling away. However, the Sparks found some momentum that they were able to sustain to outlast the Mercury and win the game. 
It all started when forward Katie Lou Samuelson — who finished the game with 17 points — sent the Crypto.com Arena into a frenzy. Samuelson, who once set the NCAA record for the most 3-pointers made without a miss (10), has shown that she can knock down threes with the best of them when she’s right. 
After hitting a three in the second quarter, her teammates suspected that her shot was indeed right. On the next possession, they immediately got the ball back into her hands, and she cashed in a second consecutive three without hesitation. 
The play was emblematic of what Samuelson can bring when she’s making shots: the ability to swing momentum. 
It’s an underrated, intangible attribute in basketball, but time and time again, one player can hit a couple shots and suddenly the whole team is storming back from a big deficit or speeding ahead and winning a blowout. 
Even though they weren’t crunch-time shots, Samuelson’s back-to-back threes in the second quarter were two of the most important in the entire game because of the ensuing circumstances. The Sparks were suddenly on a run, the home fans were screaming and the Mercury were hurriedly calling timeout, afraid of letting the game go on any longer. 
It all showed just how dangerous Samuelson is. She can turn the game on its head and bring energy to the Sparks and their fans just by hitting a couple shots. This could make her one of the most important players for the Sparks in the long run, even though she isn’t one of the primary ball handlers. 
Following a tough loss to the Indiana Fever, the Sparks lost starting point guard Jordin Canada to a hamstring injury. Former Head Coach Derek Fisher put guard Chennedy Carter into the starting lineup in their next game against the Minnesota Lynx in response. 
All Carter did in her first start of the season was lead the team in scoring, assists and rebounds. The backup point guard was suddenly the star of the team, at least for a night. 
Carter’s full stat sheet was an attribute to her great, high-level energy, which has always made her a fan favorite. That energy was likely even higher due to her determination to make the most of a starting role. 
The Sparks could have become discouraged due to the loss of their starting guard. Instead, Carter sparked the team to rally around her and get another victory despite the adversity. 
For the third win, it was guard Brittney Sykes’ time to shine. Sykes didn’t need a starting role to lead the team. Always the first one off the bench, Sykes made sure she stayed on the court with fantastic play against the Dallas Wings. She finished with 24 points, leading the team, and also secured two important steals. 
Sykes is the Sparks’ best defender, so when she is scoring, she is going to get tons of minutes. The Sparks needed every bit of offense and defense that she could provide in their hard-fought, two-point win against the Wings. 
The winning run has shown that the Sparks have some of the best depth in the WNBA. Three different players who were on the bench to begin the season starred on three different nights, leading to three wins. 
The Sparks should keep trying to find heroes in unlikely places. They are built with the kind of depth where every player on the team can be a leader, and keeping everyone involved has proved to be a better strategy for the Sparks than relying solely on their stars. 
Why do I think leading by committee instead of relying on one superstar will continue to work? 
Many reasons. Depth is built for longevity. Basketball is still a team sport, no matter how much some analysts want to focus on the individuals. But mostly, it’s because it’s ingrained into their identity. The more Sparks involved, the easier it will be for the team to catch fire. 
I hope they can embrace that identity and torch the rest of the league on their way to a championship.

It’s safe to say that USC has undergone an overhaul this offseason. With all of the coaching and roster turnover comes high ambitions and expectations that the Trojans will make last season’s losing record a distant memory with a new era of success. 
But who stands in the way? It’s time to take a look at USC’s path to greatness. Here are five matchups to watch out for as the Trojans march into the 2022 season. 
1. Sept. 10 at Stanford
No surprises with this first pick. USC’s NorCal rival hosts this year’s rivalry matchup fresh off of its first win against the Trojans since 2018. Last season’s blowout loss at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum was the infamous last straw for former Head Coach Clay Helton, the first domino to fall in what would be a historically catastrophic season for USC. 
It’s a revenge game in its purest form for USC (and especially for former Cardinal senior running back Austin Jones). Stanford is the team that sent the Trojans into a downward spiral last season, and like last time out, the matchup will be USC’s second game and first conference opponent of the season. 
2. Sept. 17 versus Fresno State
Offensive enthusiasts, be sure to tune in for what could shape up to be a high-scoring affair in USC’s third matchup of the season and first night game. Fresno State was held to under 20 points just two times last season, and the Bulldogs will meet a new, high-powered offense led by playmakers such as sophomore quarterback Caleb Williams and junior receiver Jordan Addison. 
The Bulldogs’ matchups with USC’s crosstown rivals last season was electric Pac-12-after-dark action. Expect the Trojans’ game against Fresno State to be just as entertaining. 
3. Oct. 15 at Utah
This fixture has a case to be USC’s most challenging game of the season on the road against the defending conference champions. The Trojans will be tested by Utah, the team that, along with USC, has the best odds to win the Pac-12 this season. Last season’s Utes won at the Coliseum for the first time in 105 years. 
Utah’s run game was a huge part of its success against the Trojans last season, but there’s a big difference this time around: Former running backs coach for the Utes, Kiel McDonald, is now a Trojan. Time will tell if rushing once again plays a factor in what is no doubt a crucial matchup for both teams’ conference title hopes. 
4. Nov. 19 at UCLA
The least surprising pick on this list, it’s a chance for the Trojans to wash away the pain of last season’s blowout at the Coliseum. The 2021 Crosstown Rivalry delivered about three quarters of tightly-contested play until UCLA put the pedal to the floor and painted the Victory Bell blue. 
This matchup should shape up to be a much closer affair, one that could be determined by USC’s ability to contain graduate student quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson. The Bruins’ QB exploded for 395 total yards in the 2021 rivalry game, a total the Trojans won’t be able to afford if they want to reclaim Los Angeles supremacy.  
5. Nov. 26 versus Notre Dame
Last season’s defeat at the hands of the Fightin’ Irish was one of USC’s most respectable losses of the season — now the Trojans will return to the Coliseum looking to earn a win. The most optimistic of the USC fans may claim this to be a make-or-break for the Trojans’ hopes at playoffs. It would serve as a revealing matchup as to USC’s readiness for elite competition should the Trojans still be in contention for a top-four national rank. 
Regardless of the circumstances, it will be yet another rivalry game where USC will be looking to right the ship. That alone will serve as enough motivation for a close contest.

USC’s men’s and women’s track and field teams are set to compete at the 2022 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships at Hayward Field in Eugene, Ore. from Wednesday to Saturday. The Trojans have a total of 20 athletes competing this week.
The No. 12 ranked men’s team has seven individual qualifiers and two relays, for a total of 11 men competing in Eugene. The men will have nine scoring opportunities. As for the No. 17 ranked women’s team, it will feature six women in individual events and two relays, for a total of nine women competing at the Championships. 
The 2022 NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships feature the top 24 athletes in the country in each track and field event. The top 12 finishers in each event at last month’s East & West Preliminary Rounds in Indiana and Arkansas, respectively, advanced to the Championships. Seven individual men and six individual women, as well as all four relays, finished in the top 12 to advance to Eugene. 
Sophomore hurdler Jasmine Jones and freshman hurdler Jalaysiya Smith both ran season-best sub-13 seconds in the 100-meter hurdles to advance to the Championships. Graduate student hammer thrower Joy McArthur advanced on a tie-breaker after tying for 12th place in the hammer throw, and graduate student sprinter Celera Barnes ran a sub-11 second 100-meter dash to punch her ticket to Eugene. 
On the men’s side, the 4×100-meter relay ran a 38.71, the third-fastest time in USC history. Senior hurdler Tade Ojora finished second in the 110-meter hurdles. Graduate student high jumper Earnest Sears III also won the Pac-12 title for the third time. 
For the women, junior sprinter Jan’Taijah Ford, junior sprinter Chioma Okonkwo, Barnes and Jones will compete in the 4×100-meter relay. The women’s 4×400-meter relay team will feature sophomore sprinter and jumper Kimberly Harris, senior sprinter Bailey Lear, Ford and Jones. 
The men’s 4×100-meter relay team will consist of sophomore sprinter Ashton Allen, sophomore Johnnie Blockburger, graduate student sprinter Kasaun James and senior sprinter Brendon Stewart. The quartet of senior sprinter Eric Allen Jr., junior sprinter Nicholas Ramey, Blockburger and James makes up the men’s 4×400-meter team. 
Other Trojans competing in the Championships are hammer thrower sophomore Trey Knight and 800-meter runner senior Sam VanDorpe. Some athletes competing in the relay competitions will also compete for individual titles. 
The USC men’s track and field program leads the NCAA with 26 national championships. It finished in fifth place at last year’s NCAA Championships. The women’s team won the 2021 team title and placed in the top three in the last four Outdoor Championships. It has won three national championships overall. The Trojans have come home with at least one winner in 23 of the last 29 NCAA Outdoor Championships. 
The men’s and women’s meets will compete on alternate days, with the men’s semifinals on June 8 and finals on June 10. The women’s semifinals will be on June 9 and the finals on June 11. 
The 2022 NCAA Track and Field Championships in Eugene, Ore. will be televised on ESPN Networks starting Wednesday.
