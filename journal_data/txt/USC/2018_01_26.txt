Two weeks ago, the Brookings Institution, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., released a report analyzing the student debt repayments of first-time entrants from the years 1995-96 and 2003-04. Its findings were particularly troubling for students; the study projects that 40 percent of borrowers will default on their loans by 2023. 
Considering the national student loan system has been floundering for years, these findings should not come as much of a surprise. Still, the fact that nearly half of those who receive loans cannot pay them back should open the eyes of both students and colleges nationwide. Put simply, this is a serious issue that has been put on the back-burner for far too long. And if lawmakers cannot create a reasonable solution, then universities themselves have the obligation to organize a sustainable loan system soon — for students, and for their own sake as well. 
As a major private university with a large and diverse student body, USC is certainly affected by this crisis. Without the backing of federal funding, the University relies heavily on tuition costs — which routinely rise every year — and private contributions. In fact, according to a 2016 report by Business Insider, USC is the 19th wealthiest college in the nation with an endowment of $4.59 billion. 
Considering its large pool of resources, USC should strongly consider allocating its wealth to provide more private scholarships and grants for families in need. A considerable amount of the financial aid provided by the University — 25.9 percent, to be exact — comes from federal, parent and private loans, and much of it may not be paid back at all. Far too often do seemingly manageable financial aid packages fool students into believing they are paying less than they actually are: The same students that constitute the nation’s 40 percent default rate. 
USC must also consider the range of economic disparities from its student body to improve its financial system. A 2017 report from The Center for American Progress reveals different levels of loan default across demographics, with black and Latino students more likely to default, compared to their white counterparts. 
The data showed 49 percent of black borrowers and 36 percent of Latino borrowers have defaulted on a student loan for their undergraduate education, compared to 21 percent of white borrowers. The report also analyzes college graduates in addition to overall loan borrowers, and within that statistic, 25 percent of black graduates tended to default. 
Indeed, the University should be praised for its existing scholarship system. Under it, approximately 200 applicants receive the half-tuition Presidential Scholarship (not including National Merit Scholars), 100 receive the full-tuition Trustee Scholarship and about 15 receive either the Morks or Stamps scholarships, which both offer a stipend in addition to full-tuition aid.
That is not to mention the many scholarships the University offers to a variety of students. In fact, in the 2015-16 school year, the University provided over $300 million in grants and scholarships to undergraduates.
Then again, there is always room for improvement. Stanford, Harvard, Amherst and Vanderbilt University are all examples of universities that have a “no-loans” financial aid policy, which erases most concerns surrounding rising default rates. 
As USC strives to increase its reputation among elite colleges and institutions, it must work to decrease student barriers to financial aid. At Stanford, families making less than $125,000 a year are not expected to pay for tuition, and those with an income less than $65,000 also receive free room and board. Harvard offers a similar package — families making $65,000 to $150,000 are expected to contribute at most 10 percent of their income to tuition.
Sure, these standards may be lofty for a college with a population of 45,500, but USC does not need to break the bank to ease student debt. For instance, Duke offers a less generous no-loans policy that lowered average student indebtedness to $22,526 for 2016 graduates — a quarter less than the national average.
On top of this, USC needs to prioritize the financial literacy of its students. If a no-loans policy is not realistic, then students should at least understand how to properly apply for necessary aid, and how to pay it off within the determined time period. Currently, the University partners with “Salt,” a free online-based platform that assists students with financial management. The problem with this, however, is that few students are even aware of these services. And considering the severity of the debt problem at hand, a comprehensive education in financial literacy should be mandatory. 
No matter how one approaches the issue, the student loan crisis cannot be taken lightly. USC — and all colleges, for that matter — must find a way to reform the currently failing loan system into one that is feasibly sustainable for both itself and aid-dependent families. Its financial security as an institution is on the line.

Three things.
1. Eliminate federal funding and the result will be reduced tuition costs.
2. Don’t attend a college or university that you cannot afford.
3. Attend junior college or a state school for 2 years and transfer into a more exp4nwive/prestigious school if they offer the program or discipline of sttudy.  Most undergrads do not benefit from a private university education.  They go because their parents pay for it.  
As far as kids defaulting on student loans, that’s been going on longer than I care to research.  As a freshman, kids would show up to campus and hang out until all of their checks came in, then they’d leave.  The school became much less crowded and more tranquil with the riff raff gone. Do you think those kids had any intention of paying back thein student loans? Nope.
Kudos to USC for reporting on this staggering default rate.  The lending system is the epitomy of big, bad government.  The removal of free-market, consumer protections like bankruptcy rights lies at the core of this problem.  Conservatives everywhere should be very concerned about this, and even more concerned that the government has been not only profiting on the lending system, but even profiting on defaulted loans, and using the proceeds to fund the Affordable Care Act.  We are a better  country than this.   At a minimum, the government must be reined in on this by returning the bankruptcy rights that our Founding Fathers demanded in the Constitution.  Only then will we see decreased borrowing, normalization of prices, and a stable lending system.  If this doesn’t happen, the entire thing will evaporate into a mist of big-government illegitimacy. 
There is a bipartisan bill in Congress right  now, HR. 2366, that will do exactly this (return bankruptcy rights).  The Trojam Family should get behind this.  I suspect Max Nikias knows that this is the right thing to do.

A poll by the Los Angeles Times and USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences supported suspicions of a Donald Trump presidential victory as early as September 2016. Despite initial national blowback against its fairly unique and unpopular results, the poll’s accuracy has carried into the President’s first term. Trump was doing reasonably well at the end of his first hundred days — 40 percent approvals with about 90 percent of his supporters saying they would reelect him. Throughout the course of the year, favorability ratings — both personal and policy-based — declined but remained above 35 percent. The poll’s most recent survey, the results of which were released Jan. 19, paint a far different picture. 
The president’s approval rating stands at an all-time low of 32 percent, with the deficit between approval and disapproval climbing to 23 percent — from 7 percent in the poll after the first hundred days. Fifty-two percent said he had done less than he said he would with 31 percent of the opinion that he had done “much less.” Moreover, support in congressional races for Democrats over Republicans came in at 51 to 40 percent — a double-digit lead. Only two out of three Trump voters intended to vote for a Republican in the upcoming midterm elections, as opposed to eight in 10 Clinton voters who said they would continue to support Democrats. 
Of course, these numbers reflect on the midterms in fairly obvious ways: Trump’s core base is atrophying in the absence of strong conservative victories and forgotten campaign promises; the reputation of the Republican Party is diminishing as a result, and Democrats seem to be doing a far better job at hanging onto their supporters. Aside from Trump’s abysmal approval ratings, the numbers disfavoring Republicans aren’t exactly surprising. Midterms are famously challenging for the party in power; back in 2014, Republicans were favored to win the Senate by 74 percent. The historic trend doesn’t really prove anything other than the fact that criticism, of course, is easy to espouse. And it’s far more galvanizing to champion the “ideal” policy than to defend a less-than-stellar performance failing to deliver on promises. 
So the midterms will go as they may; favorables for Republicans look low, and the Democrats stand a good chance of taking back the House. But that greater principle — the ease of criticizing and philosophizing from the periphery — reflects something else about Trump’s viability when facing reelection in 2020. How is the man who barrelled through 2016 on the merits of his “outsider” status supposed to run, much less win, as an incumbent? 
As Trump so boorishly shouted to a crowd of white voters, “I ask you this, crime, all of the problems … What the hell do you have to lose?” Voters in those same Rust Belt states — you know, the ones we’ve all been shouting and theorizing about like they’re cats that do math, or water on Mars — lended their support because “he promised change.” He’ll drain the swamp! He’ll fix the system! He’s not Washington elite! (Just New York elite, which is far less elitist!)
For all those who claim Trump’s base is made up of more than the Deplorables, here’s your chance to prove it. Because other than the racist, chauvinist and nativist rhetoric upon which he is so unafraid to capitalize (we haven’t forgotten that KKK endorsement, have we?) the only other broad-base appeal seemed to be that refreshingly honest-outsider quality — a person who, ostensibly, had all the makings of a strong and competent leader without the cumbersome “industry” ties. Assuming the Deplorables — the small, yet steady “Strongly Approve” base — prefer the former, who’s left in the latter category? It remains to be seen whether those people will remain after their non-Washingtonian, anti-establishment hero becomes an unpopular incumbent who spent his time entrenched in petty battles, lashing out at the media and being investigated for those same under-the-table wheelings and dealings that feed anti-establishment zeal.
If things look grim for Republicans in 2018, they’ll probably look grim in 2020, too, unless the Democrats completely fail to unify their message and/or nominate someone electable — not exactly an impossibility on either count. But if the Democrats pick up even a single Senate seat and win back the House as they’re forecasted to do, chances of major Republican legislative victories — and kept campaign promises — are nigh. This means Trump could head into 2020 without a commendable track record. If the GOP wants to hang on to the White House, it has to build Trump’s resume before the end of 2019. As for the rest of us, we can only hope that his lack of a viable track record (no swamp drained, no system fixed) coupled with the inability to run as a “change” candidate will render Trump an unfortunate blip on the radar, a reaction, a momentary primal scream — a placeholder president.

Trump sucks. That doesn’t mean his alternatives are much better.
Only JESUS saves!
God Bless!
Thanks You too!
There’s strong dissatisfaction with both parties, so I wouldn’t put too much credence in polling numbers.  As we saw with Trump’s victory, candidates who are, or claim to be, political outsiders are looked upon more favorably than anyone from the establishment.  Look at Oprah’s innuendo at running for President in 2020 and the resulting brouhaha that it caused as the most recent example of this phenomenon.  The Democrats are still in damage control mode.  YMMV.

A movement pushing for increased diversity among nominations has shaken up the various awards shows in recent years, and in 2018 it appears the GRAMMYs have finally caught up with the times. Now in its 60th year, voters have already made history by doing something that’s never been done before: not placing a single white man in contention for the most-coveted award, Album of the Year. 
Instead, two rap albums, two R&B/funk-influenced projects and one within the realm of electropop will vie for the title, with all five candidates seeking their first win in the category. Bruno Mars (24K Magic) and Kendrick Lamar (DAMN.) have been in this position before and are seeking to avenge losses to the likes of Adele, Taylor Swift and Macklemore, while Lorde (Melodrama), Jay-Z (4:44) and Childish Gambino (“Awaken, My Love!”) are in the running for the first time. A hip-hop album hasn’t won since OutKast’s Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, and while Bruno Mars’ radio-friendly 24K Magic will be tough to beat, the genre has as good a shot as ever with two legendary lyricists in consideration.
The aforementioned Jay-Z leads all artists with eight nominations, but GRAMMY newcomer SZA isn’t far behind him, competing in five categories including Best New Artist. Leading all women in nominations, the R&B star will look to carry Ctrl’s unstoppable momentum into 2018, before heading out on the star-studded TDE Championship tour alongside Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q and the rest of the label.
The Best New Artist category is truly stacked this year; along with SZA, breakout R&B talent Khalid and industry darling Alessia Cara have strong cases for why they deserve to win. It won’t be the only hard-fought battle; while Childish Gambino has to be considered an underdog in the Album of the Year race, his viral smash “Redbone” is one of the favorites for the Record of the Year category. With songs like “Despacito,” “24K Magic” and “HUMBLE.” also in the running, however, the tag of “favorite” is little more than a matter of personal preference, as each song had its own massive cultural moment that could easily propel it to victory.

Undeniably, the GRAMMYs switch to an online voting system, previously relying on mail-in ballots, played a role in the increased diversity and representation. Younger voters and those rarely at their permanent address during voting season saw their voices unfairly and unnecessarily quieted, but now have a better opportunity to vouch for the right candidates.
Additionally, superstar talents such as Frank Ocean and Drake have made their distaste for the awards show known by failing to submit their albums for consideration, only increasing the pressure applied by many music fans across the country. Ocean further detailed his frustrations with the committee in a lengthy Tumblr post following the 2017 ceremony, arguing that GRAMMY voters were out of touch and citing the impressive sales of his independently released Blonde as the only accolades he needed. With a slate of nominees much more representative of what’s dominating the music industry, however, the committee has set themselves up to turn the tide this Sunday night, and win back some of their outspoken critics in the process.
It’s fitting that the GRAMMYs will be held in New York this year, rather than the award show’s usual home at STAPLES Center in Los Angeles. It feels like a fresh start for the ceremony in more ways than one, as it seeks to reverse the trend of frustration and controversy following recent awards shows. 
The committee has already initiated a change in the nominated artists and a change in the venue; let’s see if Sunday also brings a change in the typical winners.

Twenty-six artists are set to bring their music to the stage at the 60th Annual GRAMMY Awards this Sunday, but of course, some are destined to stand out more than others. Read on for our five most anticipated performances at the GRAMMYs this year. 
Ben Platt
The GRAMMYs are taking place in New York City this year, so it is fitting that there are some performances by Broadway stars. Ben Platt, who won the Tony for Best Actor in a Musical, has skyrocketed to fame with his critically acclaimed performance in Dear Evan Hansen — this year’s winner of six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. Coming out of such a successful year, Platt’s set is sure to be incredible.
Elton John and Miley Cyrus
Rock singer Elton John is one of the only older legends performing at the GRAMMYs this year. He is set to perform one of his classic hits with pop artist Miley Cyrus, who released a new album entitled Younger Now in September. John and Cyrus both offer a dynamic stage presence and together, they are sure to complement each other and give a great performance. This performance is occurring only two days prior to the taping of “Elton John: I’m Still Standing — A GRAMMY Salute,” a TV tribute concert celebrating John and his longtime writing partner Bernie Taupin. 
Bruno Mars and Cardi B 
R&B singer Bruno Mars and rapper Cardi B are set to perform their song “Finesse (Remix).” Mars’ album 24K Magic was extremely popular this year, reaching double platinum status with over a million records sold domestically. Mars is one of the most nominated artists this year, earning six nods in the Album, Record and Song of the Year categories among others. His collaboration with Cardi B on “Finesse” currently sits at the fourth spot on the Billboard Hot 100. 
Cardi B has gained massive fame this year; becoming one of the most listened to rappers following the popularity  of single “Bodak Yellow” as well as several other high profile features. Cardi B is nominated for 2 GRAMMYs as well — “Bodak Yellow” is in the running for Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song. The song itself made waves with its thunderous percussion, and her set with Bruno Mars is sure to be a hit reminiscent of the ’90s. 
Sam Smith
Singer-songwriter Sam Smith returned from a two-year hiatus this year with his second studio album, The Thrill of It All, which was released in November. His album, unfortunately, was released too late to be considered for a GRAMMY, although it still topped charts in the U.K. and the Billboard 200. His hit single “Too Good at Goodbyes” reached No. 1 in the U.K. and Australia, and No. 4 in the United States upon release, living up to the lofty anticipation. With his breathtaking voice, Smith’s performance is sure to be one of the best of the night.
Kendrick Lamar
Rapper Kendrick Lamar consistently releases exceptional album after exceptional album, all of which top the charts while earning critical acclaim. He is the second most nominated artist this year; his album DAMN., released in April, was nominated seven times. The album became Lamar’s third number one album on the Billboard 200 chart, and the lead single “HUMBLE.” became his first number one as a lead artist on the Billboard 100. Lamar took the platinum album on the road with “The DAMN. Tour,” which comprised 53 mostly sold out shows across two legs, the second of which will see him traveling through Europe beginning in February. Lamar is shaping up to be one of the greatest rappers of all time, constantly innovating and changing the rap game, and his hotly-anticipated GRAMMYs performance will be one to remember. 
Live from Madison Square Garden in New York City and hosted by late-night comedian James Corden, the 60th Annual GRAMMY Awards will be broadcast live on CBS Sunday, Jan. 28. at 4:30 p.m. PST.

USC officials confirmed to the Daily Trojan Thursday that assistant basketball coach Tony Bland is no longer employed by the University. He had been on administrative leave since September. 
Daily Trojan file photo.
Bland was indicted in November for giving $9,000 to two parties associated with USC basketball in August 2017. One was an incoming recruit and the other was a family friend of a current player. He pleaded not guilty to bribery charges in November. 
Jeffrey Lichtman, Bland’s attorney, said Thursday in an email to the Daily Trojan that Bland appreciated “all that USC has done for him before and during this very difficult time.”
“[Bland] understands that USC has to protect itself even as he strongly asserts his innocence in court,” Lichtman wrote. “He wishes the team, the coaching staff and the administration the best of luck with this season and the future.”
Sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton was one of the athletes involved in the case, as Bland allegedly funneled money to him in order to steer the player toward sports agent Christian Dawkins once he declared for the NBA Draft.
After this, USC ruled Melton ineligible for the remainder of the 2017-18 season on Jan. 11, due to findings in the University’s “internal investigation.” He did not suit for the Trojans at any point this season prior to the suspension. 
In 2016-17, he averaged 8.3 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 3.5 assists per game.

“De’Anthony is a valued member of our program,” USC said in its announcement two weeks ago. “He will have options for his future at USC, including remaining in school on scholarship while continuing to work on his degree and practicing with the team, and potentially compete for the Trojans in the 2018-19 season.”
Prosecutors also accused Bland of handling a similar transaction with recruit Taeshon Cherry. Cherry, a San Diego native, previously committed to USC. The four-star is now pledged to Arizona State. According to the Los Angeles Times, neither Melton nor Cherry have been accused of wrongdoing.
Arizona assistant coach Emanuel “Book” Richardson, who was also named in the FBI probe, was fired on Jan. 11. His ousting was confirmed Tuesday. 
Bland started coaching at USC in 2013. He previously coached at San Diego State and played at Syracuse University.

After dropping to No. 3 in the national polls, the Trojans will look to make an impact this weekend at the CBU Mini Invitational in Riverside.

The one-day tourney will give the team an opportunity to notch two more wins against Cal Baptist and Pomona-Pitzer.
The Trojans’ afternoon will start out against the hosts, Cal Baptist, who have yet to win a game this season. The Lancers dropped three losses at their season opening UCSB Winter Invite, falling to Cal State Northridge, UC Santa Barbara and Arizona State. Despite the losses, the team has thrived on defense so far this season, with goalie Grace Ramirez averaging 10 saves and 8.5 goals-against in her first three games. 
Later in the afternoon, the Trojans will take on Pomona-Pitzer in their opponent’s first game of the season. Although Pomona-Pitzer went 16-18 last season, many key upperclassman starters, including top scorer Jocelyn Castro, who notched 44 goals last season, are returning this season.
The Trojans have never lost a game to either team, going 12-0 against Cal Baptist and 8-0 against Pomona-Pitzer historically. The last time the teams met, USC left the pool with major victories, thundering to a 22-1 victory over Cal Baptist and a 25-2 win over Pomona-Pitzer. 
The weekend will offer an opportunity for the team to practice its offensive schemes, setting itself up for success later on in the season.
The Trojans opened the season with a dominant 18-0 shutout of then-No. 22 LMU, and they look to continue that momentum through a series of unranked opponents early in the season.
Before the invitational, the Trojans took to the pool for a friendly match against a rare opponent on Thursday night. The team hosted the Chinese National Team in a friendly exhibition game at Uytengsu Aquatics Center on Thursday night.
The friendly match was familiar territory for several Trojans who spent the offseason playing for international teams.
Junior goalie Amanda Longan and freshman Paige Hauschild helped the U.S. national team bring home gold at the FINA World Championships this summer, while sophomore Denise Mammolito played for the junior Olympic team at the FINA Junior World Championships. Freshman Nina Ceklic also suited up, playing for the Canada Junior National Team in the junior world championships.
The exhibition was the team’s first action at home so far this season. After the CBU Mini Invitational, the team will take an extended break before playing in the Triton Invitational on Feb. 10-11. The tournament will be held in San Diego.

Ollie Jung | Daily Trojan
Since I finished my term as sports editor of the Daily Trojan in December, I’ve largely taken a break from watching the Trojans — following 20 programs over the course of the year can lead to some burnout. So even after getting an alert for USC’s 69-64 victory over Stanford on Wednesday night, I assumed that the men’s basketball program remained in a tailspin.
Last I checked, USC had lost a class-headlining commitment from Taeshon Cherry and suspended sophomore guard De’Anthony Melton for the season in connection with the Tony Bland scandal. The FBI investigation cast a massive shadow over the start of the season, and head coach Andy Enfield’s squad plummeted from its No. 10 preseason ranking. A campaign that began with arguably the highest hopes in program history looked like it had gone down the tubes before the start of conference play.
That’s why I did a double take on Thursday, when I saw the Trojans sat at second place the Pac-12 standings. 
I suppose it was easy to dismiss their chances during a 2-4 skid after Thanksgiving — including a 103-93 loss to Princeton at the Galen Center — especially when compared to USC’s perfect, 14-0 non-conference mark last season. But the Trojans have rebounded, racing out to a 7-2 start in Pac-12 play to put them at the conference summit alongside No. 11 Arizona (7-1). They earned consecutive wins at Oregon and Oregon State for the first time in the Enfield era last week. The team is riding a five-game winning streak, and after a month-long absence, it is back in the NCAA tournament in ESPN’s Bracketology projections. 
The usual suspects have spearheaded the Trojans’ resurgence. Junior forwards Chimezie Metu and Bennie Boatwright lead the way in scoring and rebounding, averaging 16.4 and 15.1 points per game, respectively, and around seven rebounds per game each.
Meanwhile, senior guard Jordan McLaughlin remains USC’s heartbeat, accounting for close to half of the squad’s assists this season while also leading the roster in steals. His clutch free-throw shooting steered the Trojans to victory at Oregon last week. 
As the team has rounded into form, it has also displayed its depth. Senior guard Elijah Stewart and freshman guard Jordan Usher joined forces from beyond the arc to rally the team past Oregon State two days after the win in Eugene, and sophomore guard Jonah Mathews came off the bench to pour in 18 points against Stanford on Wednesday. 
Redshirt junior guard Shaqquan Aaron and sophomore forward Nick Rakocevic — last season’s breakout stars — are still key contributors off the bench, and redshirt sophomore guard Derryck Thornton has been logging important minutes in his first season of eligibility since transferring from Duke in 2016. 
If this strong play continues, USC can legitimately aim to improve on last year’s round-of-32 performance at March Madness this spring, despite all the nervous buzz that has swirled around the program since September. 
As the Trojans re-enter the national conversation, however, they must avoid complacency. The team deserves praise for its mental fortitude during a distraction-filled season, but it now prepares for the toughest stretch in its schedule.
USC hosts Pac-12 cellar dweller Cal this weekend. After that, though, the Trojans have a date with UCLA in Westwood followed by a road trip to face No. 21 Arizona State and Arizona back-to-back. The two Oregon schools visit Los Angeles once USC gets back from Arizona, then the team wraps up the season at Colorado, at Utah and, finally, versus UCLA at the Galen Center. 
It would only take three wins from the remaining nine games for the Trojans to match last season’s 10-8 record in the Pac-12. But even that is no guarantee with 10 of 12 teams in the conference sitting above .500 and boasting strong records at home. Road games in the Pac-12 have been a sore spot for Enfield since the head coach arrived in 2013, and five of them wait to wrap up the regular season. 
Fortunately, only USC’s clashes against the Bears and Utes are scheduled for the Pac-12 Network — the rest will be on national television. This means Enfield’s team has the chance to turn heads around the country as they take on their strongest opponents of the season in the fight for first place.
The Trojans’ season hangs on this final run of games. They certainly aren’t irrelevant by any stretch — but they also haven’t proved anything just yet.

Debbie Lee, current USG Senator, and Mai Mizuno, USG director of community and external affairs, are both running for USG President. Photos from official campaign websites.
Undergraduate Student Government Senator Debbie Lee and Director of Community and External Affairs Mai Mizuno announced their candidacies for USG President on Thursday night. The two presidential tickets and 15 senatorial campaigns were launched on the USC USG Elections Facebook page and websites for the specific campaigns.
Lee, a sophomore majoring in political science, is one of the two presidential candidates, with USG Senator Blake Ackerman, a sophomore majoring in business administration, as her running mate. 
Lee worked with USG Director of Wellness Affairs Marina Hrovat on a recently passed resolution that called for free menstrual products to be distributed throughout all restrooms on the University campus. Ackerman worked on several other initiatives throughout his term as a senator, including the creation of a first-year student development course for freshmen to enhance their adjustment to college. 
Lee and Ackerman’s platform runs on increasing overall safety and wellness on campus through several initiatives including the establishment of rest and meditation spaces on campus, as well as an official system for ensuring student safety at Greek life events. Additionally, the pair plans on proposing a Transfer Resource Center, increasing collaboration between USG and other student organizations and monitoring the launch of the first year student development course.
The other presidential ticket consists of Mizuno, a junior majoring in international relations and philosophy politics and law, and vice presidential candidate Brianna Bozek, a junior majoring in business administration. Mizuno also took part in finalizing the resolution concerning the distribution of free menstrual products, introducing the Health Sciences Campuses into the initiative while Bozek served as the Vice President of Service and Philanthropy on the USC Panhellenic Executive Board. 
Their platform focuses on community outreach through the expansion of the USC Good Neighbors Campaign, which funds community-based organizations like Jumpstart at USC, as well as implementing more events and outreach initiatives at USC Village. They also plan on increasing transparency between USG and the student body, as well as facilitating the implementation of the eligibility requirement in Greek life. 
The 15 senatorial candidates are hoping to fill the vacancies of 12 positions on the USG Senate. None of the current USG Senators are running for reelection. 
The candidates include Manda Bwerevu, Amy Chong, Matt Crane, Cody Ela, Max Geschwind, Diviya Gupta, Jillian Halperin, Shayan Kohanteb, Meagan Lane, Andre Luna, Michaela Murphy, Gabriel Savage, Will Sherman, Neal Sivadas and Jacquelyne Tan. 
Chong, Murphy and Savage; Bwerevu, Halperin and Tan; and Crane and Gupta are running together on joint platforms. 
The first debate between the two presidential and vice presidential tickets will occur on Jan. 31. The second debate will be on Feb. 6. Students can cast votes from Feb. 6-13.

A new report from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism released Thursday found a wide imbalance in the gender representation of male and female GRAMMY Award nominees. Since 2013, a total of 90.7 percent of nominees have been male.
The study, conducted by USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, looked at the representation of gender in GRAMMY Award nominees as well as racial and ethnic groups in the music industry. Photo from iStock.
Compiled by USC Annenberg professor Stacy L. Smith and members of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, “Inclusion in the Recording Studio?” marked their first study to examine the racial and gender breakdown in the music industry.
The study focused on GRAMMY nominations for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year, Producer of the Year and Best New Artist. Researchers also evaluated the race and gender representation among the artists, songwriters and producers across 600 popular songs on the Billboard Hot 100 year-end charts from 2012 to 2017.
“The voices of women are missing from popular music,” Smith said in a USC News release. “This is another example of what we see across the ecosystem of entertainment: Women are pushed to the margins or excluded from the creative process.”
After examining the 600 most popular Billboard songs, 22.4 percent of the performers were female, but 2017 marked the all-time low in the six years the study took place, with female representation among the popular artists on the top charts at 16.8 percent. The study also revealed that women are more likely to receive credit as solo artists than be a part of a duo or band. 
Female songwriters and producers were also found to be outnumbered by men, with a gender ratio of 49 males to every female producer for the 300 most popular songs. 
“Women are rarely credited as the creative force behind popular music,” Smith said in a USC News release. “The lack of female songwriters and producers means that the epidemic of invisibility we have catalogued for women in key creative roles in film and television extends to music.”
The report also studied the percentage of artists from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups in the industry. The results demonstrated more proportional representation with the U.S. population. Among artists from underrepresented groups across the six-year time period, 42 percent of artists were female, while 40.2 percent of female songwriters were from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups. 
The Annenberg Inclusion Initiative plans to continue to collect more data to explore how to lessen the disparities in the music industry as a whole. 
“Our goal is to work with industry members and companies to continue to explore this topic, leveraging the theoretical and empirical knowledge of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative to address exclusion and create large-scale systemic change,” Annenberg Inclusion Initiative board chair Leah Fischman said in the USC News release.
And yet women are more than %70 of all students in Annenberg.
