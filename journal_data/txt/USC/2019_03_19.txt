Los Angeles’ Arts District offers a variety of cafés to hole up at to study for midterms at, chat with friends or just get a quick caffeine fix. Here’s a short list of coffee shops for the next time you find yourself in the Arts District.
Groundwork Coffee Co.
811 Traction Ave.
Los Angeles, CA 90013
Hours: 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily
The Grind: Groundwork roasts and brews its own beans — the brand can also be found at Whole Foods as glass-bottled cold brew. Its menu extends beyond coffee and tea — Groundwork offers both regular and vegan brunch menus all day.
The Cream: Groundwork has a very large space, with communal tables and tall, open windows. Bare ceilings with pipes and hanging bulbs accent the industrial feel, and there are plenty of outlets around to help you stay charged and productive.
The Roast: Unfortunately, with so many people browsing the Wi-Fi, the internet can slow immensely. If you plan on swinging by during peak hours, expect slower Wi-Fi speeds.
Go Get Em Tiger
827 E. 3rd St. 
Los Angeles, CA 90013
Hours: 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily
The Grind: A former Intelligentsia founder and barista founded this pop-up espresso bar in 2012 and opened this Go Get Em Tiger location just last year. It also serves food though the menu has fewer offerings, ranging from brunch staples like granola and burritos to more novel items like chickpea frittata and baby kale salad.
The Cream: Go Get Em Tiger runs its own text service — a barista can answer any of your questions about the shop’s coffee, products and services within the hour if it’s during business hours. Go Get Em Tiger is also one of the few companies that offera a subscription box of its own coffee beans, delivered to you monthly.
The Roast: Go Get Em Tiger’s first permanent location at Grand Central Market serves much more consistent coffee; due to the small batch nature of its beans, it’s hard to always get the same kind of brew you’d like.

Coffeehall
400 Seaton St
Los Angeles, CA 90013
Hours: Monday – Saturday: 7 a.m. to 5 p.m.Sunday: 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The Grind: Coffeehall, which opened about three months ago, is a lesser-known Arts District cafe. Though it’s not the best space to sit and study, Coffehall is broad and unique, with sofa seats fitted to loudly patterned walls and open shelving decked with leafy plants.
The Cream: Specializing solely in espresso drinks, Coffeehall serves up some of the smoothest pulls around. It uses San Remo machines and their service is quick and friendly.
The Roast: A simple coffee bar settled among various art galleries and spaces, Coffeehall can be hard to locate. Google Maps will insist it’s there, but it may take some searching to find their hidden, but geometrically designed coffee bar.

The Trojans defeated Long Beach State 5-2 at Dedeaux Field Tuesday night. The Trojans, who hold a 7-11 record, were looking to build off of a strong series at Cal over the weekend, while the Dirtbags, who are 3-15, hoped to recover after losing their last series to Minnesota. 
	The bats got going early into the first inning when LBSU junior infielder Riki Desa put the Dirtbags on the board with a leadoff home run to left field. But the Trojans didn’t blink. Junior catcher Blake Sabol returned the favor in the bottom of the first with a leadoff triple to centerfield. Senior infielder Chase Bushor later brought Sabol home after hitting a grounder, tying the game 1-1. 
Things quieted down for both teams during the second and third frame. USC freshman pitcher Chandler Champlain tossed a scoreless second inning while junior pitcher Gus Culpo threw two strikeouts in the third, rounding out the top of the inning for the Trojans. 
At the start of the fourth inning, the game was tied 1-1, and the Trojans started to heat up. With one out left, USC rallied with a single by redshirt junior pitcher CJ Stubbs and a double down the right field line by sophomore infielder Ben Ramirez. A single to center field by freshman catcher Tyler Lozano would cement the two out rally and push Stubbs and Ramirez home to give the Trojans a 3-1 lead as they entered the fifth inning.
“That was a big confidence booster for us,” Lozano said. “With two outs, getting a big hit helps a team a lot going into the next inning.”
USC picked up its momentum into the fifth inning. Freshman pitcher Calvin Schapira retired three Dirtbags to wrap up the first half of the 1-2-3 inning. In the bottom of the frame, an RBI single to left by Ramirez pushed sophomore infielder Jamal O’Guinn past home to extend the Trojan’s lead to 3. 
Down 4-1 entering the sixth inning, the Dirtbags looked to get things going offensively after four scoreless innings. LBSU responded with a two-out RBI double to center by sophomore first baseman Jacob Hughey to cut the Dirtbag deficit to 2. USC wouldn’t find a run during the second half of the frame. 
The USC bullpen continued its success in the eighth inning with Lambert retiring three Dirtbags. At the bottom of the frame, Lozano tallied his third hit of the night with a single to center field. Sabol followed up by lining up a sinker down the middle to score Lozano and make the game 5-2 Trojans.
USC held onto its lead in the ninth, and the Trojans went on to win the ball game 5-2. 
Coming off the win, USC now sets its sights on a three-game series against Washington. The Huskies hold an overall record of 11-5 and 3-0 at home. A series sweep by USC would place the Trojans at 11-11 and .500 on the season.
Heading into the series, USC head baseball coach Dan Hubbs is looking to improve on the team’s scoring efficiency. 
“I think we left quite a few guys on base today,” Hubbs said. “I think that could have been an 8-9-10 run game and it wasn’t. I’m excited about the pitching. I thought we played good defense. Against Washington we’re going to have to punch some of those runs across when we have them there if we expect to beat them.”
First pitch is at Husky Ballpark in Seattle on March 22 at 6:05 p.m.

No. 11 USC men’s volleyball took down Concordia in a 3-1 win Saturday night in USC’s North Gym.
Senior outside hitter Ryan Moss lead the offense with 18 kills and  a .412 hitting percentage while redshirt senior outside hitter Jack Wyett added 14 kills, hitting .500. Moss collected nine digs and seniors libero Matt Douglas and outside hitter Gianluca Grasso added seven apiece to anchor the defense.
The victory marks USC’s third win over Concordia this season, having beaten the Eagles twice before, at the Hawaiian Airlines Rainbow Warrior Classic in Honolulu in January and on Concordia’s home court in Irvine in February.
The Eagles (10-14, 1-6 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) came hot out of the gate, scoring 6 consecutive points to secure a 6-1 lead in the first set of the match. Aided by service errors by USC (12-8, 4-4 MPSF), Concordia maintained its lead the entire set for a 21-25 finish.
“We rebounded really well from a slow start,” Moss said. “That’s the first time we’ve lost that first set like that at home in a while, so it was kind of the opposite of how our matches have been going.”
The roles reversed in the second set as USC scored 6 consecutive points to set the score at 10-5. Although Concordia began to close in on USC’s lead, the Trojans pulled ahead once more to win the set 25-17.
The third set stayed tight with neither team dominating through 14 tie scores. Once the Trojans took an 18-16 lead, the Eagles couldn’t bring their score back up, and USC ran with its lead to a 25-21 set finish.
The Trojans steadily built their lead in the fourth set until the Eagles could no longer keep up. USC finished strong with a 25-20 set to ultimately win the match.
“I thought we showed good fight and poise and won the next three sets pretty controllably, so it was good to see us come back from a first set loss like that,” Moss said.
Redshirt junior outside hitter Barsemian led the Eagles with 13 kills and 9 digs. Redshirt junior Jordan Hoppe and redshirt sophomore Zachary Meyer had 8 kills each, with 9 and 3 digs, respectively. Hoppe put up 3 service aces on the night.
Moss said the Trojans can improve by working to make their serves and passes cleaner right from the start, having a greater sense of urgency on defense and playing with more fight from the start of the game.
The match was played in USC’s North Gym, rather than the Trojans’ usual home court at Galen Center due to a scheduling conflict. Moss said the unexpected change in location affected the team’s focus throughout the match.
“Since we were in the North Gym, a lot of guys on our team hadn’t been in there before,” Moss said. “But our senior class had — and a couple of the juniors — so we were just focused on controlling that environment. The ball can be played off the ceiling or the basketball hoops so we had to make sure we were steady throughout and didn’t let those factors affect our game.”
The Trojans remain at home to host  defending national champion No. 1 Long Beach State Saturday at 7 p.m. in USC’s North Gym.

No. 13 USC lacrosse capped off a dominant week of competition with a win over Pac-12 rival Oregon, marking the third victory of the week for the Trojans, who also beat No. 23 Virginia Tech and No. 24 Colorado.
The two victories over top-ranked teams helped the Trojans jump the ranks from No. 22 to No. 13 this week. USC holds a four-game win streak, improving to 8-1 for a Pac-12 best. 
The Trojans faced Virginia Tech over spring break and came out on top, 13-11. The teams traded goals for much of the first half, but USC established a lead and picked up momentum going into halftime by scoring 3 goals in the final four minutes of the half. This outburst came after a nearly eight minute-long scoring drought. 
After halftime, the Trojans didn’t look back. Sophomore attacker Sophia Donovan scored the first 2 goals of the second half to put USC up 9-5. USC didn’t slow down, and Virginia Tech could not close the scoring gap. 
Donovan led the team with 4 goals and one assist against the Hokies. She is currently the leading scorer for the Trojans, already matching her season-high record of 20 goals from last season — a feat she attributes to the entire team.
“Making plays and scoring goals is never a one-person process, and I consider myself lucky to be a part of this offense,” Donovan said.
Donovan is shooting markedly better than USC’s team average of .422 at .556, demonstrating her individual value to the team. 
Following their matchup against the Hokies, USC won their fourth consecutive contest in a decisive 11-5 victory over No. 23 Colorado Buffaloes at Kittredge Field March 16. Despite a minor setback due to possible inclement weather conditions in the area, the Trojans improved to 6-2 all-time against Colorado. 
The Women of Troy opened the game strong, with a 4-0 run on goals by senior attacker Emily Concialdi, who returned after a two-game absence. Concialdi dished out three assists to go with 1 goal, two ground balls and a caused turnover, making her the key player in the Trojans’ win. 
Donovan recorded her third hat trick of the season against Colorado and picked up an assist to go with two ground balls and a caused turnover, earning her Pac-12 Player of the Week honors. 
“We have focused since August on building an offense that plays to our strengths,” Donovan said. “One of our main focuses has been making simple plays and working to make each other look good on the field.” 
USC’s 6-goal winning margin matches the largest in the series’ history with the Buffaloes, who entered the match on a two-game winning streak with a pair of Pac-12 road victories over Stanford and Cal. The Trojans last faced the Buffaloes in 2017 at McAlister Field, a match they won 11-5.
“I think the biggest thing we’ve done throughout the season is keeping a good morale,” Concialdi said. “We’ve developed such a good team culture and it makes the long hours worth it.” 
The Trojans finished their Pac-12 road trip with a win against the Ducks that not only extended USC’s season-long five-game winning streak with a 14-5 victory over Oregon, but also avenged an 18-11 loss to the Ducks suffered in Eugene last spring.
With the Trojans strong, the team scored 5 unanswered goals throughout the first eight minutes of the game. But the Ducks answered by putting a stop to the run with a goal from sophomore attacker Lillian Stump. 
Sophomore goalie Riley Hertfod racked up two saves against Oregon to lead the Trojan defense.
Concialdi added 2 goals for the Trojans before the match was minutes away from giving USC its fifth win. But USC took its foot off the gas and held the Ducks to 3 goals before the final horn for a 14-5 final score.
USC’s five-game winning streak is the longest of the season and the longest since it had 12 consecutive wins in the 2017 season. Although the team seems to be hitting a stride, its players always see room for improvement.
“Each and every day at practice is a chance to improve, and I think collectively, we have bought into that mindset,” Donovan said. “As long as we keep playing simple together there’s no limit to what we could accomplish this season.”

Whenever I make my bracket for March Madness, I typically over-analyze every statistic to determine the winning team. In the past, I’ve looked at factors like the team’s free-throw percentage, rebounding and age to settle on my winning pick. But this year is different. The ACC tournament showed that Zion Williamson transcends college basketball. Duke will win. The bottom line? Stars win championships.
This year’s NCAA men’s basketball tournament has some intriguing matchups that will determine who will participate in the Final Four. Some regions on paper will be tougher than others.
In particular, the Midwest appears to be the toughest region in this year’s tournament. North Carolina headlines the division as the one seed, but it also features major college basketball powerhouses in Kentucky and Kansas, as well as sleeper teams like fifth seed Auburn.
One of the hottest teams in the country, Auburn is now in the spotlight after winning the SEC Tournament. In the past, teams coming into March with momentum generally continue to ride the wave in the tournament. Moreover, Seton Hall, a No. 10 seed, narrowly lost to defending champion Villanova in the Big East tournament. 
It’s dangerous to pick a team from the east as the winner of the tournament because there are many capable of coming out of it. This region is just too good, and will be a total grind for whoever wins it. While North Carolina has had an impressive season with major victories and an elite coach, I opted for Auburn to win out of this region. It easily beat Tennessee in the SEC final — momentum I think they will carry forward. 
The South Region also has a good mixture of some top-seeded teams and sleepers, including Virginia, which headlines the group as the top seed. It recently lost to Florida State by 10 points in the ACC tournament, but it has had a strong season, only losing three times this season.
On the other side, Tennessee can definitely make a run as the No. 2 seed. The team lost to Auburn by 20 points in the SEC finals, but defeated Kentucky the day before. Experience is an important factor in the tournament. Its starting lineup against Auburn consisted of three juniors and two seniors.
Barring an upset, these two teams in Tennessee and Virginia are likely to face off in the Elite Eight. While the game might end up being close, Virginia has been one of the best teams all season and are desperate to make amends for its loss last year in the first round of the tournament as the No. 1 team in the country. 
As the weakest link, the West is up for grabs. No. 1 seed Gonzaga recently lost to St. Mary’s in the West Conference Tournament finals by scoring just 46 points. While they beat Duke earlier in the season, the Bulldogs have upset potential written all over them. In the second round, Gonzaga will potentially face Syracuse, which also defeated the Blue Devils this season, and I predict a Syracuse win.
The West Region also contains last season’s runner-up in the tournament, No. 2 Michigan. Many Michigan players have good tournament experience, and the program has an elite tournament pedigree. While potential matchups between No. 7 Nevada and No. 3 Texas Tech may be tricky, Michigan’s experience from last year should give the team an edge and help it reach the  Final Four again.
The East appears to be No. 1 Duke’s. The bottom half of the region features the three teams that could upset Duke in No. 2 Michigan State, No. 3 LSU and No. 7 Louisville. Ultimately, Michigan State will probably claw its way into the Elite Eight after getting past Bradley, Louisville and then LSU, but will run out of steam against Duke.
That leaves a Final Four of Duke vs. Michigan and Virginia vs. Auburn. Duke’s easy run in the West Region makes them the favorite against Michigan. Ultimately the team has more stars on the court in RJ Barrett, Cam Reddish and Zion Williamson, and they should beat the Wolverines comfortably in that game.
The match between Virginia and Auburn is a harder one to pick. While Auburn has been doing well recently, Virginia is still recovering from a disappointing ACC Championship Tournament. However, Auburn has a tough run just to get into the Final Four and is by no means a lock to get out of the Midwest. In recent years, Virginia has had an elite team, but it has failed to deliver in the tournament. This year is its time to change people’s minds. 
My final prediction is that Duke and Virginia will face each other in the final round. Both teams have played each other twice this year and have split the series with one win a piece. However, on the big stage in the ACC tournament with everyone watching, Zion Williamson came up big and put up tremendous numbers on both sides of the floor. True stars shine the brightest in the biggest games, and ultimately, Zion Williamson will carry Duke to yet another championship.

A D.C. appeals court ruled that non-tenure track employees at USC cannot form unions during a hearing last Tuesday. The National Labor Relations Board v. USC decision affirms the 1980 Supreme Court ruling in the NLRB v. Yeshiva University case, which stated that tenured and tenure-track faculty at universities essentially hold managerial positions, excluding them from forming unions with other workers. 
NLRB previously decided in 2015 that full- and part-time non-tenure track employees in the Roski School of Art and Design had the right to form a union through a local chapter of the Service Employees International Union, despite USC’s objections, according to the decision. The University then appealed this decision in court. 
According to the decision, NLRB argued that adjunct faculty at USC didn’t hold a managerial status based on vague guidelines created in a 2014 NLRB decision regarding Pacific Lutheran University.
“The court held that the National Labor Relations Board is not free simply to apply industrial models to higher education, but must accommodate the way shared faculty governance actually works,” Senior Vice President of Legal Affairs and Professionalism Carol Mauch Amir wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan.  
The American Association of University Professors submitted an amicus brief on behalf of the NLRB. The brief argued that because university administrators have had more and more power in making decisions in the years since the Yeshiva ruling, the standards for determining if university employees hold managerial decisions must also change.
“In this changing context, the [NLRB] appropriately emphasizes that the party asserting managerial status must prove that the breadth of faculty authority extends to policy making that affects the university as a whole and that the depth of faculty effective recommendations or control demonstrates ‘actual—rather than mere paper—authority,’” the AAUP’s brief read. 
The American Council on Education and seven other education organizations submitted amicus briefs in favor of USC. ACE’s brief claimed that the test NLRB created in the Pacific Lutheran University decision to determine if university employees can be considered managerial counters the idea of shared governance among faculty, staff and administrators in higher education because NLRB argued that faculty do not wield as much power in decisions as other leaders.
ACE’s brief argued that the Yeshiva decision showed that managerial roles for university faculty cannot be defined analogously to workers in other industries because these managerial relationships are far different.
“The heart of shared governance is the same today as it was in 1980 when the Supreme Court decided Yeshiva: shared managerial authority accomplished through collegial interchange,” the brief read.   
In a statement to the Daily Trojan, Provost Michael Quick said the court decision upholds USC’s “principle that tenured and untenured faculty are partners in shared governance.”
Mauch Amir wrote that the court decision is a victory for shared faculty governance for university faculties. 
“Echoing the Supreme Court’s 1980 decision in the Yeshiva University case, the court held that ‘traditions of collegiality’ distinguish governance in a university from the management of a factory,” Mauch Amir wrote.   Both the AAUP and ACE declined to comment on the case and referred the Daily Trojan to their respective amicus briefs. The NLRB did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Six-time National Basketball Association champion Kareem Abdul-Jabbar spoke about his career and background to approximately 450 attendees in Bovard Auditorium during a Visions and Voices Speakers Committee event Monday night. 
The conversation, which was moderated by student Trinity Elliott and professor David Belasco, was co-hosted by the Black Student Assembly, who started off the night with a speech in light of late student Victor McElhaney, who died during an attempted robbery off-campus March 10. 
“A lot of us are suffering from [his death], and I commend people who were able to come here in spite of that,” BSA co-director Mae Gates said. “When you heard Victor speak, you would realize why he always talk as much as he did. It’s because his mind was constantly overflowing with intelligence and ideas for how to make the world a better place.” 
Speakers Committee member Sonali Netke introduced Abdul-Jabbar with an introductory video highlighting many of his athletic and professional accomplishments, including becoming an NBA star, author, documentarian and philanthropist.
Abdul-Jabbar began the event by discussing the importance of pursuing one’s dreams and goals. 
”You guys understand that you can do whatever you want to do,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “If you want to have a goal, now is the time to start reaching that goal …. The ambition that I had in grade school to where I am now involved a lot of steps but it’s really quite simple.”
Abdul-Jabbar spoke about his path to becoming an author. He said he often entered in writing competitions during grade school and took summer writing programs in high school. 
“I went to a Catholic school in New York City, and the nuns were very intense in learning the arts,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “I kind of excelled at writing, so the nuns sent me out to compete in essay contests — I never won one, but I went out there and gave it my best, and I enjoyed it.” 
Abdul-Jabbar said his basketball career distracted him from his writing. During his athletic career, he became one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history, according to the NBA website. Following his career in basketball, he returned to writing. “I didn’t realize that going to college on a basketball scholarship …. might get in the way of writing,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “That was an extraordinary part of my life. But beneath it all, that was a part of my ambition — to write and to be able to convey things that were very important to me.”
Abdul-Jabar reflected on his upbringing and discussed how the 1955 murder of Emmett Till and the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing left a major impact on his childhood. 
“Things like that can motivate you to want to change how these things are handled in our country,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “For me, it made me ask the question, “Why?” and made me want to find out why so maybe we could do something about it … because racism could end up killing you just for something as simple as a mistaken identity.”
Abdul-Jabbar said his path in life has been filled with positive mentors and influential figures who have supported him through his endeavors, including UCLA basketball coach John Wooden. 
“[Wooden] wasn’t even thinking of himself as a coach so much as a teacher. He wanted us all to leave UCLA with a degree and an understanding of how to be good parents, good husbands, good citizens.” 
The event concluded with a Q&A session, during which students and event attendees were able to ask Abdul-Jabbar questions.
Gabriel Abrams, a sophomore majoring in human biology, asked Abdul-Jabbar how students can continue to be advocates at all stages in life. 
“You don’t have to be a shining, shining star, you just have to be part of a cause,” Abdul-Jabbar said. “After that harmful couple of days in Charlottesville, the response from across the country … was that this country is not about Nazis, this is not about white supremacy … and I knew I was in the right country. It was the course of voices, it came from everywhere, that made me feel good about being an American citizen.” 
Daanyal Mirza, a junior majoring in business administration, came away from the night feeling inspired to pursue activism.
“He was a great speaker, and he gave a lot of really great advice and feedback about his career,” Mirza said. “He talked a lot about him being an advocate for civil rights.”

Tuition for undergraduate students at USC will increase to $57,256 for the 2019-20 academic year, the University announced in a press release Monday. That’s an increase of 3.5 percent from this academic year’s tuition of $55,320. 
The tuition hike is the same as last year’s, which the University said was the lowest since the 1969-70 school year. But, according to previous Daily Trojan reporting, the increase is the lowest since the 2011-12 school year, when tuition increased by 2.11 percent. The average annual tuition increase for private, not-for-profit four-year institutions over the last decade was 2.4 percent, according to the College Board Annual Survey of Colleges.  
The announcement comes less than a week after the FBI released its investigation regarding the largest alleged college admissions bribery scheme in history, of which USC was at the forefront. 
The Board of Trustees approved the change, according to the news release. Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said the tuition increase reflects rising University costs. 
“Is the cost of a tuition an issue that needs to be solved? Yes, it does,” Caruso said. “And that is a national issue. It is a USC issue and a national issue.” 
In addition to its involvement in the college admissions scandal, USC is currently being sued by 652 plaintiffs regarding former campus gynecologist George Tyndall, who is also being sued for alleged sexual misconduct. In October, the University announced a multi-tier $215 million class action settlement that will get dispersed to Tyndall’s former patients and victims of his abuse. 
“There is no issue in USC’s financial soundness, period,” Caruso said. 
Two out of three USC students receive some form of financial aid, according to the news release. Since 2008, USC financial aid has increased by 79 percent. USC is the ninth most expensive school in the country for the 2018-19 school year, according to the U.S. News and World Report.
“The value of a USC degree keeps getting stronger,” Provost Michael Quick said. “By keeping tuition increases low and boosting financial assistance, we are providing a world-class education to a diverse and talented student body who will go on to be the next generation of leaders.” 
Undergraduate Student Government president-elect Trenton Stone, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, said he hopes resources for financially insecure students are maintained as USC’s tuition increases. 
“We want to emphasize … that the University will continue to ensure to support financially insecure students,” Stone said. “Whether that’s making sure that any increase in resources is also equally distributed to things like the food pantry, to the Trojan Shelter, to the community house, to the financial aid office, things like that.” 
Stone said he believes it is up to the current and incoming administration to ensure the value of USC’s tuition is maintained and that tuition hikes are justified.
“If those promises aren’t fulfilled … if the new leadership that comes in doesn’t listen to student voices and continues to allow scandals to happen … then that value will decrease,” Stone said. 
Sam Lopez, the assistant vice president of University Advancement Communications at USC, said the University expects a decline in donations this year due to recent events. 
“It is important to emphasize that gifts will not be used to pay legal settlements,” Lopez said. “Gifts to USC always have been, and will continue to be, used solely for their intended purpose as stated in the gift agreements or in the designated fund’s guidelines.” 
The University will hold an open forum Tuesday to address tuition increases and student well-being, according to an email Interim President Wanda Austin sent to the USC community March 6. The forum will be held from 4 to 5:30 p.m. in the Ronald Tutor Campus Center on the University Park Campus and Aresty Auditorium on the Health Sciences Campus simultaneously via livestream.

Three students and two parents have filed a class action lawsuit against USC, UCLA, Stanford, Yale and several other universities claiming they were denied fair opportunities for admission Thursday, according to the complaint obtained by the Daily Trojan.
The suit follows an FBI investigation that uncovered a nationwide college admissions scam at several universities, including USC.
The suit alleges that, while the students were qualified applicants, they were rejected by various schools involved in the investigation because the universities’ admissions processes did not put the students’ applications under fair consideration.
“Each of the qualified, rejected students was damaged by the fraudulent and negligent conduct of the Defendants in that, at a minimum, each Class member paid college admission application fees to the Defendant universities without any understanding or warning that unqualified students were slipping in through the back door of the admissions process,” the lawsuit read. 
“We believe the lawsuit filed by the students against Stanford is without merit,” Stanford Media Relations wrote in a statement. “We take the issues raised through the events of this week very seriously. While we continue to closely examine our policies and processes to see if improvements should be made, we stand behind the integrity of our admissions process.”
Businessman William “Rick” Singer was also named as a defendant in the suit Wednesday.
Singer ran The Edge College & Career Network, a for-profit college counseling company accused of running the student-athlete scam, which saw over 20 students admitted to USC under false pretenses as athletic recruits.
The suit also stated that, while each university described its admission process as fair and merit-based, this was not true in the actual admission decisions. The suit claims the universities knew or should have known about the alleged college admissions scam because the bribe money went to university accounts or prominent officials.
According to the FBI investigation, 50 celebrities, executives and professors participated in a racketeering scheme in which parents paid universities to grant their children admission under false pretenses.
USC declined multiple requests for comment. 
According to the lawsuit, the universities violated California’s Unfair Competition Law, which prohibits false advertising, among other anti-competitive practices.
“To represent to students that the application process is based on merit, while simultaneously turning a blind eye to rampant bribery going on with the university’s employees, constitutes a violation of the UCL,” the lawsuit read.
The suit claims all students or their parents paid admissions fees between $50 and $100 to each university without knowledge of the “bribery scheme” that was exposed by the FBI investigation. Stanford student Kalea Woods, who also applied to and was rejected by USC, wouldn’t have applied if she knew about the scandal, the lawsuit alleged.
“Had [Woods] known that the system at USC was warped and rigged by fraud, she would not have spent the money to apply to the school,” the lawsuit read. “She also did not receive what she paid for — a fair admissions consideration process.”
Woods and Stanford student Erica Olson were the original plaintiffs in the suit, but Olson has since dropped out.
While there are currently five plaintiffs, the suit stated that based on the number of students rejected each year by each university in the investigation, thousands more could join the class action.
In addition to the class action suit filed against USC, Jennifer Toy, a former Oakland Unified School District teacher, filed a $500 billion class action lawsuit against actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman, along with dozens of other wealthy parents involved in the scheme, according to the Los Angeles Times. 
Toy alleges that the bribery and fraud scam prevented her son from being admitted to several colleges named in the FBI investigation. The suit, filed in the San Francisco County Superior Court, estimates that the cheating scandal has affected more than a million people and seeks $500 billion in damages from families implicated in the scandal, including several USC parents.

USC and attorneys representing 652 plaintiffs in several lawsuits against former campus gynecologist George Tyndall were instructed to start producing internal records and documents Monday during a Los Angeles Superior Court hearing that took place on March 14.
Judge Carolyn Kuhl ordered both parties Monday to begin producing records, most of which are medical, academic and administrative documents. Additionally, the parties will set a schedule to exchange information between the University’s legal counsel and the firms representing the victims of Tyndall, who has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct.
“For several months prior to this hearing, USC has been voluntarily producing medical and academic records under a mutual agreement with plaintiffs’ counsel,” the University wrote in a statement to the Daily Trojan. “This process is ongoing. USC is also awaiting key documents from plaintiffs’ counsel.” 
USC said it will also provide documents such as university policies and procedures, insurance policies and other relevant materials during the process. 
“An agreed-upon Protective Order will safeguard the confidentiality of documents exchanged in the case, which may include personal information about the plaintiffs,” USC wrote.
Gloria Allred, a women’s rights attorney representing 62 plaintiffs in this case, said the University will have to produce Tyndall’s personnel file and several other documents that may provide answers regarding if and when USC knew of the complaints against Tyndall. 
“Within five days from the filing of the Protective Order, USC must produce insurance policies, Dr. Tyndall’s personnel file and policies and procedures,” Allred said. “Then 30 days from March 18, USC must produce previous complaints and the complaint history regarding Dr. Tyndall … and USC investigation files.” 
Allred said she hopes the documents reveal what the University knew about the allegations and complaints made by many victims during their time at USC. 
“We cannot advise our clients about any offer that may be made … without knowledge of what USC knew about Dr. Tyndall and when they knew it,” Allred said. “For us, we think we have a responsibility to know that. We are alleging that USC knew, or should have known, about the allegations against Dr. Tyndall.”
Allred said the increase in the number of plaintiffs illustrates the magnitude of the state court suits against USC. Last month, Daily Trojan reported that there were approximately 400 victims. The number of represented victims has now increased to over 650.  
In an interview with the Daily Trojan, Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said that the board is regularly briefed on developments in the case.
“I’m frustrated that [Tyndall] has not been arrested, to be honest, and I hope it happens soon,” Caruso said. “We’re continuing to work with the lawyers, managing the exposure to the University … and at the same time, we need to be cognizant of the physical and emotional potential harm that these patients went through.” 
Allred said that, because Tyndall practiced for decades, the number of plaintiffs involved is not surprising. 
“And I think more and more people are becoming aware that they may have rights and that they can assert those rights,” she said.  
Allred said the internal records are integral to the case because she can better advise her clients as to whether or not the $215 million federal class action settlement is satisfactory compensation for the allegations against Tyndall. 
“We need to have full disclosure by USC in order to be able to assess any settlement offer,” Allred said. “We are objecting to the settlement … we are opting out on behalf of our clients. [The settlement] is likely to be inadequate … and we need to have more information.” 
Last October, USC agreed to the $215 million class action settlement that provides various tiers of compensation to an estimated 17,000 patients who saw Tyndall for women’s health services during his time as a gynecologist at the Engemann Student Health Center. 
The settlement was submitted to federal court Feb. 12 with additional provisions outlining ways in which USC would have to improve Student Health oversight and reform its health care services. The settlement requires USC to appoint an independent women’s health advocate, staff a female physician and establish anonymous channels for patient feedback. 
“The $215 million federal class action settlement offers a fair and reliable alternative to individual litigation in state court by providing expedient relief in a manner designed to respect the dignity and privacy of all women impacted by this experience, regardless of when their visits occurred,” USC wrote. 
According to the University, the legal costs of the class action settlement and the state court cases representing over 650 plaintiffs will not burden student financing.  
“The University is in strong financial health and is working with its insurance carriers regarding this litigation,” USC wrote. “We do not expect that resolution of these cases will have an impact on tuition or other costs carried by our students.” 
Sam Lopez, assistant vice president of University Advancement, wrote in an email to the Daily Trojan that with recent news and developments, however, donations to the University will be affected this year.
“Due to the news, the University expects a decline in giving this year,” Lopez wrote. “It is important to emphasize that gifts will not be used to pay legal settlements. Gifts to USC always have been, and will continue to be, used solely for their intended purpose as stated in the gift agreements or in the designated fund’s guidelines.”

Freshman Tahrima Bhuiyan wasn’t surprised when she first learned about the national college admissions scandal from a segment on “The Daily Show.”
“We have Harvard, Yale-level students who are making Harvard, Yale-level stats [at my high school] — even I  was,” Bhuiyan said. “When we all got our rejections, I was like, “There has to be something rigged about this.’” 
On March 12, the FBI disclosed from its investigation that 50 celebrities, executives, lawyers and professors had paid millions of dollars to change their children’s standardized test scores, bribe university officials and coaches and create fake athletic profiles to earn their children admission to USC, UCLA, Yale and Stanford, among other colleges. 
According to court records, 24 students were allegedly admitted to USC under the guise of athletic recruitment between 2011 and 2019, the most of any university implicated in the investigation. 
After meeting a number of wealthy legacy students in her first year at USC, Bhuiyan questioned how many of them were admitted based on personal merit. 
“It’s who you know, knowing someone on the admissions board or having those connections can help you get in, but there’s so much else,” Bhuiyan said. “If a low-income student who is first-generation … doesn’t have those connections, they would be at a disadvantage.”
So far, USC administrators have taken preliminary measures to address the issue, including terminating senior associate athletics director Donna Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic — two key players in the alleged athletics bribery scandal — on March 12. USC is the only university with a senior athletics official indicted in the case. 
Heinel and Vavic, along with former women’s soccer coaches Ali Khosroshahin and Laura Janke, were indicted Tuesday for their involvement in the case. 
“We understand that the government believes that illegal activity was carried out by individuals who went to great lengths to conceal their actions from the university,” USC wrote in a statement. “USC is conducting an internal investigation. Donna Heinel and Jovan Vavic have been terminated, and the University will take additional employment actions as appropriate.”
In a briefing, U.S. attorney Andrew Lelling called the investigation, code-named “Operation Varsity Blues,” the “largest college admissions scam ever prosecuted by the Department of Justice.”
According to court records, The Edge College & Career Network, a for-profit college counseling business founded by William “Rick” Singer, is accused of running the student-athlete recruitment scam. Parents across all eight universities named in the charges allegedly paid Singer nearly $25 million to admit students to universities through bribery and posing as athletic recruits.
Charged with money laundering, obstruction, racketeering and conspiracy to defraud the United States, Singer — who came to serve as a cooperating witness in the FBI investigation last September — pleaded guilty March 12.
To earn students admission to USC, Singer allegedly bribed the four USC Athletics staffers. The scam allegedly involved forging information on applications to allow certain applicants to be admitted as athletic recruits, despite having no experience and not playing once recruited. 
“On multiple occasions between 2014 and 2018, Singer’s clients made payments of more than $1.3 million to USC accounts controlled by Heinel, typically an account for the USC Women’s Athletic Board,” court records said. “Singer also entered into a sham consulting agreement with Heinel … in exchange for the bribe payments Heinel helped facilitate the admission of more than two dozen students as recruited athletes.”
The court records allege that Singer directed payments totaling $350,000 to a private soccer club owned by Janke and Khosroshahin, which was used to support the profiles of those admitted through the USC women’s soccer team, even though they never played. Similar payments were allegedly made to grant students admission to the USC water polo team, though they never participated.
“The board, all of us, are obviously very disappointed in what happened,” Board of Trustees Chairman Rick Caruso said. “It is incredibly unthinkable in my opinion, of what these parents did with these administrators and these coaches.”
More than two dozen students were admitted to USC under false student-athlete pretenses, the court records allege. Fifty executives and actresses have been named in the indictment for alleged involvement in false athletic recruitment for sports including men’s water polo, women’s soccer, women’s lacrosse and football. Several applicants involved in exam cheating reportedly received extra time on standardized tests like the SAT and ACT.
Homayoun Zadeh, a professor at the Ostrow School of Dentistry, was placed on leave after being named in the federal indictment. According to the charging documents, Zadeh allegedly plotted to bribe former senior associate athletics director Donna Heinel to admit his daughter as a lacrosse recruit, though she never played the sport.  
Additionally, the forty were indicted for college entrance exam cheating. Several applicants involved in exam cheating reportedly received extra time on exams. 
Entrepreneur Peter Jan Sartorio’s daughter, who applied to USC, received a score of 27 out of 36 on her ACT, which placed her in the 86th percentile — after she was allegedly provided with extra time. Previously, she had scored 900 on her PSAT, which placed her between the 42nd and 51st percentile, according to the court records. In one instance, Heinel, Janke and Singer allegedly agreed to recruit an applicant to the USC women’s crew team in September 2016. The court records state that Singer sent photos of the a student in a boat; however, according to the court records, the actual applicant was the one in the pictures. 
The next month, the USC athletic admissions subcommittee granted the applicant conditional acceptance to USC on the condition that she meet the NCAA eligibility requirements, the court records read.
William McGlashan, a founding partner of investment firm TPG Growth, has also been accused of participating in the admissions scheme in order to grant his son admission to USC, court records read.
According to the court records, McGlashan’s son sought admission to the Iovine and Young Academy. In response, Singer allegedly created a fake football profile that labeled McGlashan’s son as a kicker and punter, though his high school did not have a football team. 
To make the profile, Singer allegedly said he would modify photos so that McGlashan’s son would be portrayed as a kicker. In a phone conversation, Singer also allegedly said that Heinel gave him instructions on how to make the profile. McGlashan was also instructed to make donations totaling to $250,000 to women’s athletics, according to phone transcripts in the court records.  
In the phone conversation, McGlashan also allegedly discussed how to keep these means of admission secret from his son. 
“I would tell him, ‘Listen, I got lots of friends in athletics,’” Singer said, according to the phone transcript. “‘You’re an athlete kind of guy, and my friends in athletics are going to help you … They’re going to help you get in. Because they have the easiest way in.’”
Once Singer agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation last September, the court records allege he warned McGlashan and other clients about the investigation. Singer later agreed to an additional charge of obstruction of justice when he continued to cooperate with the FBI.
“Fuller House” actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, as well as resort executive Gamal Abdelaziz and investment firm CEO Robert Zangrillo are also among those accused of allegedly bribing USC athletic department officials and creating fake athletic profiles to earn their children admission to the University. 
“Fuller House” actress Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli allegedly paid to have women’s crew athletic profiles created for both their daughters, Olivia Jade, a social media influencer with over 1.4 million followers on Instagram, and Isabella Giannulli. The two currently attend USC. According to court records, neither daughter has experience rowing nor currently rows for the University.
At the time of publication, the University confirmed that Olivia and Isabella are both still enrolled at USC, but their status has been put on hold.
Isabella is a sophomore majoring in communication. According to a statement released by the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism public relations and journalism faculty, the alleged scam is a “gross lapse of governance and accountability” and is causing students distress.
“Transparency, honesty and accountability are at the core of the journalism and public relations professions,” the faculty statement read. “For that reason, we believe we have a moral and intellectual obligation to speak out and demand that USC uphold these values.”
The statement, backed by a unanimous vote of journalism and public relations faculty during a meeting on Monday, pledges to investigate the University’s admissions systems through a series of joint faculty-student projects. 
Alejandro Lomeli, a freshman majoring in chemical engineering, said that the news of wealthy families scamming the admissions system is unfair to students who overcome obstacles and low income backgrounds to attend college. 
As a Latinx student who attended a low-performing high school, Lomeli said that college counselors often told him to not expect much when applying to selective universities like USC. But when he and other minority applicants did get into prestigious colleges, he said they were told they were admitted through affirmative action and took spots away from more qualified students. 
Lomeli said he was the only student in his year to be admitted to USC from his high school. While he is grateful to attend USC and receive the financial support he needs, Lomeli thinks schools like USC need to make more of an effort to accept students from lower income backgrounds, who lack access to resources.
“I would have loved to see USC admit more students from backgrounds like mine, who still work hard despite having disadvantages that other demographics are fortunate with not having to deal with,” he said. 
In a March 12 email to the USC community, Interim President Wanda Austin stated that USC is a “victim” in this case. She wrote that the alleged bribery was mainly perpetrated by the now-terminated staff named in the case.
Austin wrote that the University is taking “significant remedial actions,” including reviewing admission decisions, identifying any funds that could be connected to the allegations, implementing new processes and training to prevent future bribery cases.
In addition to terminating Heinel and Vavic, Austin announced in a memo to the USC community March 14 that the University has launched an internal investigation into the scheme. The University also began identifying donations that were made in connection with the scam and will look to redirect the funds to create scholarships for underserved students, according to the memo. 
Austin announced that USC has rescinded and denied admission to applicants who are connected to the allegations in the 2019 application cycle.
The University also announced Monday that students linked to the admissions scheme were informed of a hold placed onto their accounts, preventing them from registering for classes or acquiring their transcripts until their cases are reviewed. After reviewing each application, USC wrote that it will take “proper action” for each student, possibly including expulsion. 
“We will make informed decisions about those cases as the reviews are completed,” Austin wrote. “USC’s Office of Professionalism and Ethics, Student Affairs and Admissions and Enrollments are conferring on this process to ensure the University follows the appropriate course.”
Caruso said Austin’s presidency has been bringing USC’s culture toward one of accountability and transparency.
“It is very difficult to eliminate or completely prevent isolated incidents from happening, especially when you have 40,000 employees,” Caruso said. “The meaningful test is to take all the action you can to prevent all the bad things from happening. But then you also have to react appropriate and swiftly.”
Caruso praised Austin for firing Heinel and Vavic and for sending a “strong” message to the community.
“It is a clear demonstration on Austin’s part that there is a new day at ’SC in terms of accountability, a new day in terms of culture, and we’re moving upward and forward,” Caruso said. “We will not tolerate any kind of bad act that impacts the integrity of students and this University.”
Board member John Mork said recent press coverage has made the University seem corrupt, but he believes the administration has taken all the necessary steps to begin the remediation process. Mork said he agrees that USC was a victim in the alleged scam. 
“It will hurt our reputation to some extent,” Mork said. “They scammed people, and the victimhood is going to go on because it’s misreported in the press, and they would have you believe that the entire athletic department and the entire admissions department is somehow fouled up, and that’s not right at all.” 
Undergraduate Student Government president-elect Trenton Stone said that he and vice president-elect Mahin Tahsin have scheduled meetings with administrators in the next few days and will attend a Board of Trustees retreat, where they will discuss student perspectives on the admissions scandal with University officials and the steps USC can take moving forward. They said that in the coming days, USG will discuss what role their leaders can play in the remediation process.
Stone said as they transition into their new leadership roles and welcome new University leaders next semester, he and Tahsin have the responsibilities in making sure that the new president and other officials understand how past scandals have impacted students’ relationship with and views of the University.
“A lot of people are upset with USC, and they’re right to do that,” Stone said. “There’s issues that are happening, and the only way to renew that trust is with this new leadership coming in to be able to show their full commitment to the student … and that they’re willing to make the necessary changes.” 
By talking with University officials and administrators, Tahsin said student leaders can make sure that student voices are taken into account for campus changes moving forward. 
“A lot of that representation for students comes with student leadership being involved in these committees and these departments that are trying to shift away from the culture that has existed,” Tahsin said. “I think that is the best way that students can firsthand impact the change that’ll form USC for years to come.” 
Stone also said it’s important for USG, Graduate Student Government, Academic Senate, Faculty Senate and other governmental bodies to work together in the future to push for change in issues, such as the lack of transparency in administrative actions. 
Rich Szabo, a parent of two USC freshmen, said people were not familiar with the University in St. Louis. But since the alleged college admissions scandal has captured national headlines, Szabo said friends have asked him if he had paid for his kids to gain admission to USC. 
“It never really had any kind of name recognition, now it has probably a bad recognition,” Szabo said. “At least here, nobody had heard of any of the other scandals that had gone on in the past few years, but people have now heard of this one mainly because of the Hollywood connection.”
Szabo said he worries that this negative reputation could hurt the value of his children’s degrees once they graduate. 
Junior Ryan Rogers, who is majoring in business administration, said that the University seems to be more elite and sought after if high-ranking families are willing to pay hefty costs to reserve a space for their children.
“People wouldn’t spend $500,000 to send their kid to a school that was not good and not highly regarded and not the best of the best,” Rogers said. “The kids who have earned their way here and have worked hard to get here should feel all the more satisfied that they’ve actually earned it.”
Ted Kaiser, who graduated from USC in 2005, donates $3,000 to USC Athletics each year as a member of the Cardinal and Gold program. He also purchases football season tickets and regularly makes donations to the Marshall School of Business. 
Kaiser considered stopping his annual donation to the University following Austin’s controversial announcement to terminate Marshall Dean James Ellis following this academic year. According to Kaiser, some of his friends have halted their donations and chosen not to purchase season tickets for this upcoming season.
Kaiser said that a few days before the college admissions scandal made national headlines, he decided to make his donation for the next academic year. But Kaiser said if he doesn’t see substantial changes in leadership soon, he may eventually pull his funding. 
“Frankly, it’s kind of appalling to me that [Austin] tries to play USC and the administration as a victim in this case, when to me, it goes more to the fact that the overall leadership has not been nonexistent both at the athletic department and the University as a whole, which is why you continue to have scandal after scandal,” Kaiser said.
Dean Hallett, an alumnus who donates $30,000 each year on top of other gifts to the Marshall School of Business and USC Athletics, said he will continue with his current donations despite the controversies surrounding the University. Still, he also looks forward to a new USC president who will help the University rebuild its culture and reputation. 
“The Trojan blood in me runs so deep, I don’t think it changes how I feel about the University as an institution,” Hallett said. “It certainly changes my view of the current administration at the University.”
