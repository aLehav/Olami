The Keck School of Medicine appointed professor Ricky Bluthenthal on Jan. 1 as the associate dean of the Office of Social Justice, which was recently launched by Keck Dean Laura Mosqueda.
Mosqueda said the Office of Social Justice will explore issues like environmental health concerns, racial disparities in the health care system and gun violence.  
“We’re very interested in the nexus of medicine, health care … and social justice,” Mosqueda said. “USC is in … a premiere position to be looking at issues like equity in terms of access to health care … Our initiative relates to finding an organized way for us to approach these issues as a Keck community.” 
According to the USC Street Medicine website, Keck currently runs a program that provides free care, counseling and medication for homeless individuals in more than 60 U.S. cities. The Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority reported that as of last year, 31,285 individuals in the city of Los Angeles are experiencing homelessness.
Mosqueda said that by establishing the Office of Social Justice, Keck officials can execute the Street Medicine program and other similar initiatives with more organization and efficiency. She said Bluthenthal’s role is centered on constructing the proper framework for the school’s social justice initiatives by involving the input of the Keck community.
The first step in that process will consist of a listening tour, during which Bluthenthal will speak with Keck faculty, staff and students and gather information on what they expect from the new office. The Office, Mosqueda said, is currently in the process of drafting its mission statement.
“I’ll need to meet with student groups and figure out what the issues are from their perspective,” Bluthenthal said. “… I look forward to being able to report very specific changes that we’re able to implement moving forward.” 
Bluthenthal said he will also work to identify and support Keck initiatives that are already making progress in the field of social justice.
Mosqueda said she chose Bluthenthal for the position because of his history working with at-risk communities, as well as his reputation as a mentor to students and other faculty members at Keck. 
According to Keck’s website, Bluthenthal has contributed to over 125 scientific articles. Bluthenthal said his research focuses heavily on HIV and Hepatitis-C prevention for people who inject drugs. He began his research on the effectiveness of needle exchange programs in 1992 and said he plans to continue his work as the associate dean of social justice. 
“He truly has a track record of being engaged in the community and working toward helping some of the most vulnerable members of our society,” Mosqueda said. “He’s just a wonderful human being. [He] has a true passion for [social justice] … He’s a proven leader.”  
Mosqueda was appointed interim dean of Keck in October 2017 before officially becoming dean last May. After conducting her own listening tour in 2017, she said she saw a need to explore social justice as a common thread throughout the school’s community. As a result, Mosqueda, with her experiences researching elder abuse and the criminal justice system, decided to launch the new office.
“I’ve seen what happens when people do and don’t have access to health care and some of the effects our policies have on the most vulnerable members of our society,” Mosqueda said.
While Mosqueda said she is not aware of any other universities who have hired deans of social justice, Bluthenthal said a few other medical schools, like UC San Francisco, have incorporated a social justice component into their education programs. 
“The basic idea is to achieve equitable access to the very best healthcare for people throughout society,” Bluthenthal said. “The social justice lens directs us to consider not only what goes on in a medical visit … but to consider the other 60 percent of our lives … and to try and mobilize elements of the medical school to address that additional 60 percent of the healthcare equation.”

There is no easy fix for political polarization, Columbia University professor Mark Lilla warned students at Ground Zero Performance Cafe  Wednesday. But, he said, there is a glimmer of hope — the reality of a common good. 
Lilla, who teaches humanities and religion at Columbia, sat down with Center for the Political Future co-director Mike Murphy to discuss the current state and direction of the Democratic Party. The event marked the second in the Center’s political conversation series. 
The discussion began with a reflection on Lilla and Murphy’s 2016 presidential election predictions. Lilla, a Democrat, and Murphy, a Republican, both admitted they predicted incorrectly. 
In reaction to President Donald Trump’s victory, Lilla wrote an op-ed for The New York Times titled “The End of Identity Liberalism,” which argued that modern liberals are more narrow-minded because they focus solely on groups whose ideologies apply to them.  
“I’d been dissatisfied for quite a long time by the way in which the Democratic Party and the presidential candidates had approached elections,” Lilla told the audience. “I tried to make the case that we were in need of a liberalism that didn’t begin with people’s identities.” 
The piece became the Times’ most read opinion article of the year, garnering so much attention that web traffic temporarily froze the server at the Times. The paper had to turn off the comments on the article due to the high volume of responses, he said. 
Lilla expanded on his explosive argument against liberal identity politics in his book, “The Once and Future Liberal: After Identity Politics.” 
“Very fruitful conversations have not happened in the United States,” Lilla said. “The reaction to the book has been so moralistic, preening and chest-beating, that I’ve had to go abroad to have a sensible conversation.” 
When it comes to national and global issues like partisan divisions, Murphy said the Center encourages civil discussion rather than vilification of the other side.
“One of the things we try to do at the Center is address the problem of tribalism, where the basic equation of politics is ‘I’m right, they’re evil,’” Murphy said. “And the danger there is … if they’re evil, you can say or do anything to them.” 
Lilla and Murphy agreed that identity politics have pushed the Democratic Party away from their vision for solidarity, making Republicans feel like the “other” party. Lilla said he originally believed that identity politics works toward equality of citizenship, but that it has caused these different parties to become more polarized.
“The identity idea became not one of demanding rights on the basis of equal citizenship, but an identity politics based on expressing, emphasizing and even exaggerating difference,” Lilla said. “The word difference popped into the vocabulary of the left to the extent that the rhetoric was … based on the notion that if you do not belong to my group, you cannot understand me.” 
He ended the discussion by calling upon audience members to fight for solidarity through party involvement, rather than just through expressing political opinions online. 
“Hitting ‘send’ is not a political act,” Lilla said. “In order to be involved, you have to be involved in the party. I keep trying to encourage young people to be involved.” 
Jackson Reinhardt, a senior majoring in political science and law, history and culture, said Lilla’s work has influenced his views on political polarization. 
“I’ve always loved Lilla’s writings,” Reinhardt said. “I found his argument on what the Democratic Party, or at least what American liberalism needs to do to unite to win elections, very persuasive.” 
Mana Afsari, a junior majoring in classics and non-governmental organizations and social change, is also a fan of Lilla. Afsari said she enjoyed Lilla’s commanding presence. 
“What I appreciate about the way he presents himself is that he doesn’t bother with nonsensical, firebrand questions,” Afsari said. “He’s come to talk about what he wants to talk about and what he’s an expert on.”

The USC men’s tennis team continued its recent success in the ITA Weekend Kickoff Tournament last weekend. After returning from a trip to Australia, the No. 5 Trojans defeated Cal Poly Saturday and defeated UC Santa Barbara in the final on Sunday.
USC went up against Cal Poly in the first round and swept them 4-0. All three Trojan pairings started off slow in doubles, with sophomore Daniel Cuckierman and freshman Bradley Frye losing their match 4-6. Juniors Brandon Holt and Riley Smith were able to overcome their slow start, however, and came up with a 6-4 victory. The deciding doubles match came down to the wire, but seniors Laurens Verboven and Jack Jaede were able to clinch the set with a 7-5 win.
The singles matches were much more straightforward, as the Trojans got three straight set wins from Holt (6-4, 6-0), Smith (6-3, 6-2) and Cuckierman (6-1, 7-5). This completed the sweep and secured USC’s place in the championship match on Sunday against the Gauchos.
The doubles on Sunday against Santa Barbara proved to be much easier for the Trojans. Holt and Smith dominated with a 6-1 victory, which Cuckierman and Frye followed up with a straightforward 6-2 win. With the doubles point easily secured, the match turned to singles.
Smith secured a quick victory once again in singles with a 6-2, 6-2 win. Similarly, freshman Mor Bulis won 6-3, 6-2 in his match. Santa Barbara was able to get 1 point back, as Verboven lost 6-2, 6-3. After Holt and Cuckierman split sets in their matches, all of the attention turned to freshman Jake Sands to clinch USC’s win. Sands stood strong under the pressure and pulled out a gritty 6-4, 6-4 win to give USC the tournament.  
Holt and Cuckierman both played out their matches and in the end, Holt won his match 7-6, 4-6, 6-4. Cuckierman was the last to finish with a hard fought 6-3, 5-7, 6-4 win. At the end of the day, USC won both of its matches over the weekend and qualified for its 11th consecutive ITA National Indoor Championship, which will be held in Chicago on Feb 15.
“As a team, we were all just ready to go, and we are excited for this year,” Smith said. “I think we are going to compete our butts off. I think we really have a chance to just do something special this year. Tournament is nothing different to us, and we are just going to go out there and compete.” 
The good news continues to come in for the Trojans. It was announced Tuesday that Holt won Pac-12 Player of the Week honors following his undefeated record this past weekend. Women’s tennis junior Angela Kulikov also won the same honor this week, marking the first time since 2015 that USC tennis has had a men’s and women’s player take Player of the Week honors in the same week.
The Trojans continue at home tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. with a double header against UC Davis and the University of San Francisco. In the opening match, USC will look to overwhelm a young UC Davis team that has only one upperclassman. It will, however, be a tricky matchup, as the young Aggies have a 6-0 record heading into tomorrow’s matches. USF comes in with an undefeated record as well, although they have only played one match. USC will look to best its result against the Dons last year, when USC won 5-2.

USC men’s basketball was unable to overcome a poor first half on Wednesday, falling to the Washington Huskies by a score of 75-62 on the road. Washington’s ability to defend and rebound gave the Huskies the edge in the game, and they were able to maintain their perfect Pac-12 record of 8-0. The Trojans fell to a 5-3 conference record.
The Huskies immediately showcased lockdown defense, preventing USC from putting together any significant offensive run. Junior forward Nick Rakocevic was the only Trojan to score in the first six minutes, totaling 7 points. However, Washington continued to dominate on both ends of the court in the early minutes, taking a 15-7 lead.
Washington started to turn the ball over following the early lead, allowing the Trojans to cut their deficit. Senior forward Bennie Boatwright led the charge with 4 straight points off of a jumper and two free throws. Ten minutes into the half, USC was down 17-15.
USC shot poorly as the game progressed into the latter portion of the half. The Trojans especially struggled from beyond the arc, missing their first six 3-point attempts. The Huskies used the missed shots to attack USC in transition, either drawing fouls or finishing from short range. Washington would then go on a 14-3 run with three minutes left in the half, leading by a score of 31-18. 
The Trojans failed to score consistently for the entirety of the half, shooting 33 percent from the field and 14.3 percent from the 3-point line. Boatwright and Rakocevic carried the majority of the offensive load, combining for 18 of the team’s 25 first half points. USC’s poor shooting and abundance of turnovers gave Washington a significant advantage, despite having eight turnovers of its own.
In the opening minutes of the second half, USC’s offense improved, emphasized by a quick 4 points from redshirt senior guard Shaqquan Aaron. The Trojans also pressed the Huskies defensively and forced misses from distance. As the clock approached the 15-minute mark, USC was only down by 4 points with a score of 41-37. 
Washington countered the Trojans’ run with a strong presence on the offensive glass and were able to break down USC’s defense in transition. Freshman guard Kevin Porter attempted to shift the momentum back to USC with a dynamic alley-oop and deep three, but the Trojans were still down 54-46 halfway through the second half.
USC continued to keep pace with Washington’s offense, but the Trojans’ inability to rebound consistently kept them from breaking into their deficit. Washington senior forward Noah Dickerson overpowered USC from the inside, finishing the game with 21 points and 14 rebounds. In addition, he gathered a dominant six offensive rebounds.
The Trojans were unable to keep up with the physicality of the Huskies and were forced to foul them repeatedly in the final five minutes of the game to attempt a desperate comeback. 9 of Washington’s final 11 points came from the free throw line. These points only widened Washington’s commanding lead into the end of the game and eliminated any possibility for a comeback.
It was a dismal overall performance from the Trojan offense, which managed just 62 points on 40.7 percent shooting from the field. Besides the 22 and 16 points from Boatwright and Rakocevic, respectively, no player scored in double-digits. The Trojans shot just 31.3 percent from three and had a negative assist-to-turnover ratio at 13-to-18.
Washington succeeded offensively. The Huskies didn’t shoot particularly well from the field, but they bullied their way to 17 offensive rebounds, creating numerous extra scoring chances. Washington dominated the total rebounding numbers 40 to 28.
The Trojans will look to break even on their Washington road trip when they face off against Washington State on Saturday at 4 p.m. USC will attempt to capitalize on this opportunity against a weaker opponent, as the Cougars hold a poor 1-7 conference record.

This was supposed to be a fun column.
I had the idea to write about NBA Pride last Wednesday, when the Brooklyn Nets hosted Emmy Award-winning choreographer Travis Wall at their third annual Pride Night. The evening tied into New York’s yearlong celebration and remembrance of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots — a seminal moment in the gay pride movement. 
It was one of many similar events hosted throughout the league, as the NBA slowly adopts a more vocal stance on gay pride. Most importantly, it looked like a hell of a lot of fun, at least from the eyes of Wall, who posted approximately 30 Instagram stories documenting his excitement from the sidelines, tossing T-shirts into the crowd and cheering on players whose names he didn’t even know.
That’s what I wanted to write about this week — the joy of seeing one of the top two leagues in American professional sports create a special event specifically to lift up and embrace the queer community. It was supposed to be a fun, happy column about love, grace and acceptance. 
But then, news broke yesterday of the hospitalization of “Empire” star Jussie Smollett. Early Tuesday morning, Smollett was attacked by two men in Chicago. He was beaten and throttled around the neck with a rope. His attackers poured bleach on his bare skin while calling him a “n——” and a “faggot.”
There aren’t words to describe the feeling that gripped my gut as I read that news report the first time, the second time, the third and fourth and fifth. I wanted to puke. I wanted to scream. I wanted to cry. That’s the weird thing about homophobia — it makes you feel as if you’re split in two. It makes you want to curl into yourself and lash out, to go back into the closet and to pin rainbow patches to every single item you own. It makes you wish you weren’t gay. It makes you wish that everyone was gay.
Mostly, it reminds you that you’re different, you’re part of the “other” and that people hate you for your otherness. Still. Fifty years after Stonewall, four years after Obergefell v. Hodges. That hate burns on.
As a white, straight-passing woman, I know that there’s privilege in the extent of my fear. I know that I can hide behind my sorority sweatshirts and avoid the type of surface-level violence — both emotional and physical — that assaults queer-presenting people of color on a daily basis. I’m privileged because my sexuality is a non-issue with my friends and family, and because I’ve never been at physical risk due to my appearance. 
My experiences with the isolation and shame of homophobia are a watered-down version of what many others face. And I’m aware that the attack on Smollett had as much to do with the color of his skin, that it was an intersectional hatred that led these two men to commit this crime. But this attack makes clear why it is vital for sports leagues to continue to advocate for the queer community. 
Many people like to tell us that the gay rights movement is over, that things are better now, that there’s no more fighting to be done. That’s a lie. Just because we earned our marriage rights doesn’t mean that we aren’t at risk, that we aren’t struggling for our lives on a daily basis. Children are still sent to conversion camps. Trans people still can’t serve their country in the military. Queer people of every shape, size and color are still beaten and left to die.
The gay pride movement is not over. We have to fight like hell everywhere and that includes in sports. Some might say that a Pride Night is a political motion, or simply a public relations stunt. It’s neither of those things. More than any organized religion, sport is the most powerful faith in America. It is worshipped and cherished in every state, in every city. It is our common language. It defines how many of us see ourselves. And when teams take the time to lift up the queer community, to celebrate us, to love us, they slowly teach our country how to do the same.
It is beautiful that owners in the MLS, NHL and NBA understand this truth (I pray that soon the NFL will follow, although I recognize that might be a far-off pipe dream). Perhaps they don’t see the full depth, or see it only as a politically correct gesture. That doesn’t matter to me. Each Pride Night, from here on out, will help build a safer future for the queer community — a future where we will accept as fact that love is love and that people are people, all deserving of respect and safety, no matter their color or sexuality.

With the plethora of content on streaming sites available today, deciding what to watch on Netflix or Hulu can become a hassle. It’s a well known fact that USC students’ email addresses grant them access to HBO GO, yet many students are oblivious to the fact that they also have access to Kanopy, a lesser-known streaming site with an impressive collection of award-winning films and documentaries. A wellspring of cinematic bliss for film students, Kanopy can also just be a place to find tried-and-tested content for the cinephile in all of us. 
Here are six must-watch films streaming on Kanopy, all available through the USC Libraries website on the databases menu. 

6. “The Lobster” (2016) dir. Yorgos Lanthimos
 One of the best things on Kanopy is its new collection of A24 films. From the studio’s early days to its more recent releases, Kanopy offers a full treatment on one of today’s most critically acclaimed indie film production groups. 2016s film “The Lobster” landed the studio and Greek writer-director Yorgos Lanthimos an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. Lanthimos’ films tend to follow complex characters who attempt to survive in a strict world rapidly closing in on them; “The Lobster” is no exception. What results is a darkly comedic inquiry into how far humans are willing to go to get what they desire. Such is also the case with Lanthimos’ 2019 Best Picture nominee, “The Favourite.” “The Lobster,” his first English language film, is a worthwhile viewing for those looking to explore the filmmaker’s skewed worlds on a deeper level. 

5. “Lady Bird” (2017) dir. Greta Gerwig 
 Another A24 modern classic, first-time director Greta Gerwig’s “Lady Bird” was one of the most critically acclaimed films of 2017. Starring Saoirse Ronan in the titular role, this is a classically constructed coming-of-age story expertly adapted for a modern audience. Brimming with quotable lines and fiery exchanges, “Lady Bird” exudes the angst that comes with growing up and moving on from high school to college. Gerwig’s film explores the entire spectrum of emotions — from anger to joy — that teenagers experience. At the same time, it’s a touching family drama, delving deep into the intricate mother-daughter relationship at its core. 

4. “City Lights” (1931) dir. Charlie Chaplin
Black-and-white silent film can be a turn-off to many contemporary viewers. Anything prior to the “Talkie Revolution” is regarded by modern moviegoers as being reserved for only the true film critics or students (or, at least, those who pretend to be). Charlie Chaplin’s masterpiece “City Lights,” however, is a direct contradiction of such stigmas; it’s a highly entertaining rom-com, a gut-busting slapstick comedy and an emotional study on the nature of true love all rolled into one. Chaplin’s gags never grow old — notably, his boxing sequence in this film is widely considered to be the best of the silent era — but his emotional efficacy as a star and filmmaker is what viewers have the deepest impression of when they walk away from “City Lights.” 

3. “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” (1964) dir. Jacques Demy
 Before Damien Chazelle’s 2016 musical phenomenon “La La Land,” there was Jacques Demy’s “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.” Chazelle has cited this 1964 film as the primary influence for his musical’s visuals, music and narrative. A poster boy for French New Wave cinema, Demy fused beautiful visuals with heartbreaking songs to construct an essential film for musical fans. In the vein of classical musicals like “Les Misérables” and modern ones like “Rent,” “Cherbourg” is entirely sung — but before that becomes a potential turn-off for viewers, the vibrant pastel-flooded frames entertain the eyes, making the film an enthralling experience that also presents a twist on cliche romance plots. 

2. “Memento” (2000) dir. Christopher Nolan
 “Inception,” “The Dark Knight Trilogy,” “Interstellar” and “Dunkirk” director Christopher Nolan has already cemented his name in cinematic history. Thanks to Kanopy, fans can return to Nolan’s roots with his first indie hit, “Memento.” Starring Guy Pearce, the film is classic Nolan, implementing multiple timelines, secretive characters and the ultimate plot twist. More than just a confusing trip, however, “Memento” captures the mind as it gradually reveals more (but never too much) information, slowly pulling back the shroud on the mystery at its center until it reaches an especially jaw-dropping finale. 

1. “Ex Machina” (2015) dir. Alex Garland 
 With the genre-redefining “Star Wars” and “Star Trek,” science fiction took on a new meaning in the cultural conscience. Today, these titles are synonymous with a genre that originally consisted of dystopian, philosophically dense films. Alex Garland’s “Ex Machina” is a simple, elegant return to the basics. This “Black Mirror”-esque film immerses viewers inside a billionaire’s lavish estate-turned-laboratory where artificial intelligence is slowly developing a resemblance to true humanity. It’s a slow-burn plot that culminates with a satisfyingly violent finale accented by captivating performances from Oscar Isaac and Alicia Vikander. “Ex Machina” will undoubtedly spark within viewers deep personal musings on the film’s many postulations.

Walking into my favorite hairdresser’s salon Monday afternoon, the smell of burning oil and scented hairspray engulfed my senses, reminding me of the days I spent on the carpet of my aunty’s house as she carefully cornrowed my hair. For black women, hairstyling is an intimate experience. From hot combs barely singeing our scalps to our mothers washing out our relaxers in the kitchen sink, our hair lives many lives, sees many faces and continues to be one of the most sacred yet politicized aspects of our cultural and artistic expression.
This month, I decided to trade in my kinky, coily curls, for a straight, hot-pressed look. I do this at least once a year, mostly to gauge how long my hair has grown since I started wearing it naturally five years ago. Like most black women, I grew up suffering from the use of relaxers, a lotion-type cream that contains harsh chemicals to permanently straighten hair. It is rooted in the black community’s attempt to assimilate into American society, by obtaining “desirable” beauty traits in hopes of better social, political and professional treatment.
I vividly remember the pain of having those harmful chemicals burn through layers of my scalp, and remember the damage it did to my hair. 
Slowly, I began to realize that Eurocentric ideals for beauty are not only unattainable for black women, but also harmful to our physical and mental health. So, one night, during my sophomore year of high school, I cut all my hair off and defiantly began embracing my natural hair.
My L.A. hairdresser, Eleanor Mott, has taken on an essential role in my hair journey. I go to her at least once a year, but I text her often for tips on how to maintain healthy hair — because good hair is based on health, not texture. Mott runs Healthy Hair Suite by herself out of her home in View Park. She specializes in the restoration and maintenance of curly hair and is responsible for the hair regimen I have today. 
Before meeting Mott, I would use hundreds of products, including deep conditioners, co-washes, leave-ins, oils, scalp greases and random hair creams that were on sale at the store. She advised me to trim it down to only six products: a shampoo, a regular conditioner, a deep conditioner, leave-in conditioner, oil and the occasional curl cream on the side. The result was healthy, thriving hair. 
Since then, she has been the only person I trust with my hair — the only person I trust to put in (organic) highlights and certainly the only person I trust to hot press my hair, knowing she won’t burn or damage my cuticles. She told me that straightening my hair once or twice a year is very important — especially for people who have thick hair. It is essential to relieve pressure on the roots.
“When it comes to natural black hair, cleansing, shampooing and conditioning techniques and routines are monumental for the hair to stay healthy and beautiful,” Mott said. “And every so often, it is good to blow dry the hair and flat iron it straight to simply get through every single piece of strand on your head, as well as let the scalp get some breathing time. When you have black natural, thick hair, the scalp doesn’t always see sunlight.”
Mott opened Healthy Hair Suite in 2010 to meet the demands of clients who were looking for someone who specialized in healthy natural black hair —  not just styles, cuts and color. Professional hair schools do not teach hair stylists how to properly style or manage black natural hair. This was one of the biggest shocks I had when I first wore my hair natural, as I realized that the hairstylist I used to go to could perfectly relax and style my hair, but I had no idea how to wash it or care for it once my hair was natural. 
This is where Mott comes in handy.
She opened her first salon above a beauty supply store on Wilshire Boulevard, where she would work the floors in an attempt to promote her own business. She would answer questions from individuals who came in for advice on how to manage and care for their natural curly hair. She said Healthy Hair Suite attracted many clients because almost everyone seemed to need someone who could teach them about proper hair care. 
“When it comes to black hair, if a person doesn’t know how to care for one’s hair, it can easily become an unmanicured garden, meaning tangles, breakage, frizz, non-health and shine,” she said. “Even hair loss can result from improper care of the hair and the scalp.”
As more black women begin to embrace their natural hair, they will find that most products they once used will no longer work, and more importantly, a lot of the ingredients they once used will even damage their hair.
“I am very picky about the ingredients in the products I use,” Mott said. “I stay away from anything synthetic-based, too much alcohol, silicones, chemicals. I also recommend supplements for people, special brushes, silk scarves, scalp massages.”
It takes three hours for Mott to straighten my hair. She starts off by shampooing, then moves to a scalp scrub, a deep conditioner, a lukewarm water rinse, an even deeper conditioner, a cold wash and then a low-heat blow dry. For the final step, she flat-irons my hair at 360 degrees.  
Once my hair is ready, I see it is longer than it has ever been — reminding me of the days when my hair was relaxed and would constantly break off, never growing past my shoulders. As she cuts my bangs, I have to hold my breath, fearful of losing the length that had taken so long to grow.
 I thought about how hair length was something my black friends and I were always obsessed with when growing up because the other girls at our schools always had long, flowing hair, and their hair grasped the praise of those around us. I found, by not adhering to the standards forced upon our culture by society, we and our bodies are able to thrive in the ways they are naturally supposed to. Next time, I tell her, I’m coming for cornrows. I haven’t tried that in years.  Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior writing about black-owned businesses in Los Angeles.

Think about the average college student’s goals: managing homework, maintaining a high GPA, establishing a solid social life and mastering independence after leaving the nest. Mindful USC is an initiative to help combat the unnecessary stress, but it overlooks some of the immediate symptoms of stress, including poor self-care. Mindful USC needs to promote a healthier image of a successful college student, so students can not only practice mindful activities but also  build healthy habits. 
Mindful USC was created to help students cope with stress, create healthy work environments, encourage emotional intelligence and promote artistic expression. Recently, Provost Michael Quick sent the student body an email regarding Mindful USC’s progress. 
According to Quick, more than 4,000 people have utilized the program, and many find it beneficial. This program was a great first step in the right direction — however, students still struggle with their mental health and poor self-care. 
Despite efforts to improve mental health conditions on college campuses, depression and anxiety are increasingly common in the sphere of higher education, but this shouldn’t be the case. USC recently published its Healthy Minds Study, in which over 4,500 students were asked about their mental health. The survey showed that 22 percent had moderate to severe anxiety. Additionally, 1 in 4 students reported facing moderate to severe depression. 
Mindful USC’s programs are neither required nor widely advertised, which could affect their ability to help students on campus. Students are unlikely to make time for events that aren’t very visible on campus or marketed well on social media.
The combination of a busy schedule and shortage of funds results in malnourished and unhealthy students. Most college students do not prioritize habits like shopping for fruit and vegetables or checking their physical and mental health, which are  essential to success in college. Without fundamental self-care, it’s hard for students to tackle additional topics like mindfulness. 
Some might argue that healthier eating requires more money, but this is untrue. In 2013, Harvard University conducted a research study that analyzed the cost of a healthy versus an unhealthy diet. They concluded that it costs an extra $1.50 a day to eat healthy and roughly $550 annually. However, the study advocated for a healthy diet regardless, because the cost is much less than the cost of a medical bill for issues arising from unhealthy eating habits. 
Healthy habits also include a proper sleep schedule, something uncommon among college students. Staying up for a test all night will only cause one to be exhausted and cause the brain to function more slowly than it would with a proper rest. 
Although late nights are inevitable, stress and poor living habits should not be normalized or encouraged. 
The stress students experience entering USC is enormous, but mindfulness initiatives can alleviate this problem by helping students develop and maintain healthy living habits. Simple changes in diet and sleep are great steps toward changing the image of a typical college student, but they missing from Mindful USC’s platform.

In November 2018, a record-breaking number of women were elected to Congress. Many spoke openly about how they couldn’t see themselves in American politics until the election of President Donald Trump, when they realized there was simply too much at stake to sit on the sidelines. Despite a growing trend of women running for office, we remain far from gender parity in government. Women still only comprise roughly a quarter of Congress and just over a quarter of state legislature seats. 
There is no shortage of theories on why the gender gap in elected office remains so significant. Predominantly male political scientists have long argued that there is simply a natural ambition gap between men and women. And while unearned confidence certainly tends to be a male trait, others have argued that the political gender gap starts early on in careers, based on who is encouraged to pursue leadership — and who is not.
I can’t help but think about the political gender gap just weeks leading up to Undergraduate Student Government elections, which will include an all-female ticket for president and vice president and many female students for Senate. Student government doesn’t exactly have the best reputation as a serious, influential institution, at USC or otherwise. But USG operates with a $2 million budget, and it works closely with the administration to guide key decisions about the livelihood and interests of the student body. Student government matters — and so do the individuals we elect.
In the grand scope of gender parity and diverse representation in government, USC’s campus serves as a microcosm for a greater national issue. The disparities we see in our federal, state and local governments today are borne out of generations of non-inclusive campus culture. Every student government election offers a fresh opportunity to correct this.
Lived experience shapes what elected officials — and certainly, student representatives — are aware of and choose to prioritize. In addition to introducing and passing almost twice the number of bills as their male counterparts on the federal level, Congresswomen are also more likely to focus on key domestic policy issues such as health care, education and the environment. And at this University, which lacks access to free menstrual hygiene products and adequate support for sexual violence survivors, a broad culture of campus sexual assault and threats to women’s safety remains despite the termination of former gynecologist George Tyndall. That said, it’s very clear there is one USG presidential ticket that understands and is equipped to address this daunting reality, and it is, unsurprisingly, the ticket that consists of two women. 
Across the country, leadership gaps and vast disparities in power across gendered lines do not exist in a vacuum. They start from the ground up, in what we teach elementary school students and in whether or not we listen to and support female and diverse candidates for student government. These gender disparities in power and leadership pose deep, broad threats and barriers to the success and safety of other women and marginalized communities. The #MeToo movement has exposed horrific realities around how male-dominant power dynamics cultivate cultures of sexual abuse and exploitation, often targeting women subordinates. The prevalence of gender and racial wage gaps across all industries — and gender gaps in leadership positions, promotions and pay raises across all industries — are also a product of men dominating powerful decision-making roles.
Rome wasn’t built in a day, and in some ways, neither was the patriarchy: The innocuous, everyday gender gaps in power and leadership start somewhere. Playing a role in student government can give groups underrepresented in American politics the skills, tools and confidence to continue to pursue leadership outside of school, which is what makes electing a diverse student government so critical. Just as diversity is America’s strength, it is also our University’s. However little you may think of student government, understand the deep, real-world consequences of your vote and whom you cast it for.
