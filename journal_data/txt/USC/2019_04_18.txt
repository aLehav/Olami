By now, most everyone in our USC community has taken notice of “Tent City” on Jefferson Boulevard that appeared with the start of the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books last Saturday.
As a USC graduate student and a member of USC Forward, I can illuminate why our organization is working to form a graduate student union — and why we helped create Tent City: We did so as part of a grassroots coalition working to raise awareness of how previous leaders at USC have lost their way on an array of issues.
This includes the rapid gentrification and neighborhood displacement caused by USC’s civic leaders and their redevelopment policies.
This includes alleged willful ignorance by USC administrators to their own students’ sexual assault claims, which persisted for decades.
And this includes consistent attempts by USC administrators to prevent their own graduate students and faculty from forming a union.
The goal of our Tent City is to compel USC’s new leaders to put the University on the right track. 
I first became involved with USC Forward in 2017. At that time, Paul Ryan, who was Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Republicans in Congress had added a provision to their Tax Reform Bill. It would have taxed the tuition remission which I receive through my fellowship as if it were my personal income. Had this passed, I would not be a USC graduate student because I would not be able to afford to continue my education.
USC Forward organized a small group of members to travel to Ryan’s office in D.C. and protest the bill. They made sure that the press covered it and that it made the national news.
Within a week, the provision had been withdrawn. This demonstrated to me the power of collective action and the importance of USC Forward’s mission. 
Graduate students are on the front lines of higher education. We do much of the teaching at USC; we’re working on the cutting edge of research that has made USC so renowned over the years. 
And yet, we are an afterthought to the administration. 
When former campus gynecologist George Tyndall was allegedly allowed to assault and harass students for years, the students’ bodies that were victimized.
And yet when the scandal broke and former University President C. L. Max Nikias was forced to resign, students were denied a substantive role in the hiring of a new president.
Meanwhile, USC Forward held workshops to help train and educate students on how to deal with sexual harassment and assault, especially when the perpetrator is their faculty advisor or a person in a position of power over them.
We want the new administration to know that USC Forward has worked for years to protect the interests of graduate student workers on campus. We’re not going away.
We understand the interrelation between the high-quality work we do and the high-quality education USC provides to students. We know the value we bring to USC. We know that USC can more than afford to pay us a living wage and reasonable benefits.
USC is sitting on a $5.5 billion endowment and over $9 billion in assets, with annual tuition costs rivaling Harvard and Yale. Yet they canceled spousal health care coverage. This means my wife and I have to pay out of pocket for medical care while we try to raise our family on an income just barely above the threshold to qualify for food stamps.
Just a few days ago, our coalition brought a new round of demands directly to USC administrators.
A key demand was that USC recognize our union instead of blocking the efforts of students and faculty to organize.
USC administrators rely on us day in and day out to educate the student body.
So you would think that they would listen when we speak out for living wages and a collective voice at work.
Instead, they have consistently tried to stymie the efforts of students and faculty to organize.
But they have failed — and if they continue to fight us, they will continue to fail.
We are University instructors. We do the teaching. We know when someone deserves a failing grade.
All the scandals endured by the USC community took place on the previous USC administration’s watch.
Their tenure was judged a failure by stakeholders and students and they deserve that failing grade. But we don’t.
Certain things are keeping USC’s reputation intact during these tough times: excellent courses, high-quality instruction, cutting-edge research.
All those things are made possible because we — the graduate students and faculty at USC — do that work.
If USC continues to move forward — and it must — it will be thanks to the members of USC Forward and the work we do. It will be because we truly love this University — its mission, its students — and we want to be proud of USC’s legacy.
I urge the new administration at USC to acknowledge this reality. The sooner they do, the sooner the University can stop wasting time, money and energy on embarrassing damage control.
The sooner they do, the sooner they can start investing those same things in higher education — and the sooner they can craft a new vision for community revitalization that works for all Angelenos.
We, the members of USC Forward, look forward to it.

Heading into the final two matches of the regular season, the No. 10 men’s tennis team is seeking two wins over Arizona and Arizona State along with a loss by UCLA to win the Pac-12 regular season title. 
The 4-3 loss to UCLA on April 5 put the Trojans in second place behind the Bruins in the Pac-12 standings. 
“Our goal is to just stick together,” freshman Bradley Frye said. “We’ve had some tough losses, especially the one against UCLA, so we just need to stand together and protect our house.”
The Trojans will need some help this weekend from the Arizona schools to move back into first place and lock up the regular season title along with the top seed for the Pac-12 tournament in Ojai, Calif.
Coming into the home matchups, the Trojans are on a two-match win streak and currently sit at 15-7 overall. The Wildcats are 17-4 overall and 3-3 in the Pac-12 with three consecutive wins, including an upset over Oregon. Meanwhile, the Sun Devils head into the weekend on a six-match win streak and are 4-2 in Pac-12 play. 
The Trojans need to use the home court advantage, where they have a dominant 7-2 record. They will need to continue to play the type of tennis they displayed last weekend when they swept both Washington and Oregon, as they close out the regular season.
“We need to treat it as any other match,” said redshirt senior Tanner Smith. “I definitely don’t want to make it about myself or the seniors, I want to make it about creating momentum for the team,” 
The men’s team takes on Arizona at 3 p.m. Friday. USC will then face Arizona State Saturday at 3 p.m.
The women’s team also continues its impressive season. After losing consecutive matches for the first time this year against Pepperdine and Washington, it bounced back to pummel Washington State 4-1 in Pullman, Wash.
The No. 15 Trojans will face perhaps their toughest test of the season when they take on a UCLA team desperate for revenge after USC upset the Bruins on their home court in March. 
There is more on the line than just dominance over Los Angeles. Both teams sit at 7-2 in conference play and will fight for the best positioning behind Stanford in the Pac-12 standings. The Bruins and Trojans are in a three-way tie with Washington for second place heading into rivalry weekend. This weekend’s results are imperative for seeding in the Pac-12 tournament.
This weekend will not be as easy as the victory earlier this season as the Bruins have rounded into form and are seeking to return the favor. The Trojans will need to be sharper than ever to avoid a loss and carry their momentum in the Pac-12 tournament.
“I think for this year there are no expectations, it’s just been about jumping in and seeing what we can do,” junior Angela Kulikov said. “Every time we set an expectation, honestly, we exceeded it, so I’ve learned better than to set a new limit.” 
The women’s team hosts the Bruins 11 a.m. Saturday.
Both teams still have a lot to play for in the final weekend of the regular season — championships, seedings and bragging rights are all on the line as they near the postseason.

The No. 2 USC women’s water polo team will travel across town to take on No. 3 UCLA in the Bruins’ home waters this Saturday. 
The Trojans, who are 22-1 overall and 4-1 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, already defeated UCLA this season in a decisive 10-3 victory in the championship match of the Triton Invitational back in February. 
In preparation for the match, the Trojans are working on all aspects of their game. 
“Our main focuses are targeting their weaknesses but at the same time finding our strengths and using them to our full advantage and staying as a team,” freshman utility Bayley Weber said. 
Junior utility Maud Megens leads the Trojans this season with 58 goals, which places her at No. 2 for goals scored in the MPSF this year. Senior goalie Amanda Longan anchors the Trojan defense with 192 saves, positioning her at No. 1 in the MPSF this season. This week, Weber earned her third MPSF Newcomer of the Week Honor. Weber has recorded 27 goals in her collegiate career so far. 
The USC-UCLA matchup comes with a sense of rivalry, but the Trojans are not letting it distract them from the game itself. 
“We’re obviously focusing on our defense, but at the same time, knowing how big the rivalry is between us and making sure we don’t overlook them as a team because we don’t want our rivalry to overstep or be bigger than our focus on the game,” Weber said. “So still focusing like it’s a normal game but having in the back of our mind that we want to beat them too because of the rivalry.” 
Junior attacker Maddie Musselman leads the Bruins with 49 goals on the season. Senior goalie Carlee Kapana has 167 saves in the book, and sophomore goalie Jahmea Bent has 80 of her own. 
Two weeks ago, USC’s 36-game win streak was snapped by a loss to Stanford, which has led the Trojans to refocus on how they work as a team.
“The loss hit us really hard, but I think it brought us together even more to realize that our ultimate goal is to win,” Weber said. “We’re going to have to beat Stanford two more times up at their home, so I think the focus and the intensity have become much harder. I think it ultimately kind of helped us because we’ve come together and realized we need to make sure we’re on top of everything.”
The Trojans have been going through administrative changes this past month with the firing of Jovan Vavic, the team’s head coach for 25 years. Now, heading into the last match of the regular season, the team has become very close, Weber said. 
“I think we’ve become exceptionally close to each other,” she said. “We’re with each other 24/7, so I think, even with everything that has gone on, we’ve kind of put it to the side and come to have our eyes on the prize … It’s helped us in some ways but also not helped us in other ways.”
Weber added that the team’s leaders have been crucial in keeping the squad on track.
“I think our captains are doing a great job of keeping us on the right path and just keeping everybody together,” she said. “[We’re] not thinking of outside things during practice hours and just thinking of the game.”
The match tips off at UCLA’s Spieker Aquatics Center at 4 p.m. The action will be broadcast live on Pac-12 Networks.

USC defeated Pepperdine 5-2 at Dedeaux Field Tuesday night. The Trojans entered the game looking to rebound after dropping two of three games in a series against Utah in Salt Lake City. Pepperdine also looked to bounce back following a 3-2 loss to UCLA just the day before. 
Sophomore pitcher Brian Gursky started the game for the Trojans and Pepperdine threatened early. In the first inning, Pepperdine freshman infielder Wyatt Young hit a leadoff single that skipped into right field. Two batters later, Pepperdine had runners on both corners after redshirt sophomore outfielder Reese Alexiades flew out to center field, advancing Young to third base. Despite runners on first and third, Gursky closed the inning out, and both teams entered the second inning scoreless. 
Pepperdine’s bats started to heat up in the third inning. Young singled to left field to start the frame, advancing to third on a double by senior outfielder Matthew Kanfer and setting him up to score on a sacrifice fly by Alexiades. 
Freshman pitcher Chandler Champlain hopped on the mound for the Trojans to start the fourth inning. Champlain struggled early, allowing two hits and advancing a runner on a wild pitch. Pepperdine added to its lead on a ground out RBI to make the score 2-0. Champlain stranded a runner to finish the inning but the Trojans needed a response. 
In the bottom of the inning, junior outfielder Matthew Acosta provided just that when he blasted his fifth home run of the year off of a sinker by redshirt freshman pitcher Raul Salazar. The homer sailed over the right field wall, cutting Pepperdine’s lead to 1 run. USC’s next three batters all grounded out, but the Trojans had regained a semblance of momentum. 
In the fifth inning, USC’s bullpen continued to deliver with Champlain allowing only one hit and stranding a runner. Meanwhile, the Trojan offense caught fire. 
The rally began with a single by junior outfielder Brady Shockey up the middle. Junior catcher Blake Sabol followed with a single of his own to put Shockey on second. A sacrifice fly advanced the two runners, and Shockey ultimately tied the game up on a wild pitch by Waves redshirt junior pitcher Michael Mahony. 
“We got the scouting report that the guy throws a lot of curveballs coming out of the pen,” Shockey said after the game. “So I was just told to be ready and look for anything in the dirt and be extra aggressive. Once I saw that ball get past him, I took off.”
After the run, Mahoney walked sophomore infielder Jamal O’Guinn, who stole second on the next pitch and advanced to third on an error by Pepperdine’s catcher. Sabol came home to give USC a 3-2 lead. Sophomore infielder Ben Ramirez tacked on another run for the Trojans with an RBI single. 
USC’s offense went back to work in the bottom of the sixth and cemented their lead with an RBI single by redshirt junior catcher CJ Stubbs that sliced into right field and pushed Shockey home for his second run of the day. 
Sophomore pitcher John Beller took over for Champlain in the seventh and threw a scoreless inning. Pitchers freshman Carson Lambert and junior Chris Clarke struck out two batters and held Pepperdine scoreless over the game’s final two frames. 
The game was full of strong performances for the Trojan bullpen. USC held Pepperdine scoreless over the game’s final five innings and struck out six batters while walking just two on the day. Champlain tossed the fourth, fifth and sixth innings, allowing only three hits and 1 run while picking up his second career win. 
Ramirez led the team in hits and highlighted a stellar offensive performance by the Trojans, going 3-for-4 at the plate with 1 RBI. Sabol had two hits and 1 run while Shockey made it to home plate twice.
“We did a nice job of not beating ourselves,” head coach Dan Hubbs said. “I thought the pitchers threw a ton of strikes, we played good defense and we obviously had that 3-run inning where we were able to put up a crooked number and that was something we had trouble doing the last couple days in Utah. Overall, it was a nice win, and we got to do that more often, just have a nice boring win.”
With the win, USC improves to 15-20 and looks ahead to a three-game series against Washington State. The Cougars are last in the Pac-12 with a conference record of 1-11. First pitch is 6 p.m. Thursday at Dedeaux Field.

It’s hard now to fully understand the impact of Jackie Robinson in his time. In the week leading up to his annual celebration throughout the MLB, I was struck by this truth during a visit to the Sports Museum of Los Angeles, the sprawling home of one of the widest collections of sports memorabilia in the country. The vast majority of this museum is dedicated to baseball, and specifically the Dodgers, which the city of Los Angeles inherited from Brooklyn. 
Over the years, sports have become a time capsule, a mirror that we use to reflect the reality of day-to-day life. Out of sports, we mold heroes that loom larger than life. Many of these men and women are simply great for what they did on the field, but some were their greatest off the field, when the lights turned off, and they faced the world outside of sport. Robinson was one of these superheroes, whose strength went beyond any baseball diamond. 
With the museum focused so deeply on Robinson’s lifelong team, it’s impossible to escape him throughout the exhibits. Posters for Jackie, old jerseys, an entire rack of books about the icon — everywhere throughout the museum, the history of Robinson’s career and the legacy that he left behind is memorialized left and right. But what drew me the most was a comic book — titled “Jackie Robinson and the Crucial Series” — detailing his team’s National League duel with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1949.
At the time, comic books were a popular medium. They weren’t just for Wonder Woman and Captain America; comic books and pulp fiction were one of the most popular forms of reading material in the country. While graphic novels have begun to pick up some of this similar appeal in the modern era, the height of the comic book coalesced in many ways with the height of baseball’s popularity.
So it’s not surprising, of course, that a momentous occasion in sports history would be documented at the time in comic book form. Still, while flipping through its pages, I couldn’t help but marvel at the similarities between the way that Robinson was portrayed and the ways that a superhero might be illustrated in a similar comic book.
Especially right now, with the impending premiere of the final Avengers movie, the superhero has retained its height in American pop culture. Most people are familiar with how one of these characters would look in a comic — chiseled with muscle, hands on their hips, eyes glinting as they spouted quick comebacks and beat up the bad guys.
In the comic, Robinson looks the same way. He is illustrated as taller and stronger than the other Dodgers, with thick-cut logs as forearms and bulging biceps. Even the description on the book’s cover — “And it was Jackie, with his fiery spirit, flashing speed and heavy hitting, who led his team to its greatest triumph of all time!” — makes Robinson sound like some sort of superhuman, living out an action hero’s storyline on the baseball diamond.
For some reason, this struck me as, at the same time, wildly outlandish and touchingly true. Robinson was a superhero. He didn’t wear a cape, but he wore a jersey; he didn’t have superpowers, not really, but what wasn’t superhuman about his batting average, or his ability to withstand the brutal racism that followed him throughout his career?
More often than not, we look to sports for heroes, for people to revere for their ability to handle or hit or block or throw a ball. But often, we’re looking to these athletes to be heroes in a different sense, to teach us how to be strong or passionate or charitable. We look to these people as examples of the way we see ourselves and our societies as any given point in time. 
It’s true now, and it was true then, too, in Robinson’s time. Then, Robinson was a superhero as strong as any comic book character, a regular hero who beat up the bad guys with his baseball bat every week and proved every bigot on the block wrong. 
Often, the proclivity to revere athletes is pointed out as a major failing of sports fans. Why look up to someone, many will say, who is just good at smacking a ball around? What these people fail to see is the power of these athletes outside of the game.
Robinson was the first and perhaps the best to make this point. He was as strong off the field as he was on it, and as good, too. And in that way, he will always be baseball’s — and America’s — superhero.

At the center of the food scene in Little Saigon — a community of Vietnamese residents and businesses spanning the cities of Westminster, Fountain Valley, Garden Grove and Santa Ana — seafood restaurants are pioneering an unexpected kind of fusion. 
I stood outside a strip mall restaurant in the heart of Garden Grove, the smell of spices and butter seeping out of its doors. Even though my friends and I arrived 30 minutes before it even opened, we were in the back of a line 10 people thick. Our group of partially white, partially Asian, all high school juniors was waiting impatiently for The Boiling Crab. 
The Boiling Crab serves Vietnamese-Cajun food, a twist on classic Cajun cooking with Vietnamese standards. Instead of a simple crawfish boil, seafood is cooked in broth full of staples like lemongrass, fish sauce and garlic. Within steaming bags of crawfish steeping in buttery, fragrant broth, is a story of American assimilation, Vietnamese identity and monetary success.  
Vietnamese-Cajun food begins with the story of Vietnamese immigration in the United States. During the Fall of Saigon, thousands of Vietnamese refugees were relocated across America, filling military bases in California and Texas. These first wave immigrants gave others a bridge into a new world, and hundreds of thousands made the Gulf their home, settling in Louisiana, Florida and Texas, with a majority finding jobs in the seafood market. 
In California, over 50,000 Vietnamese refugees were sent to Camp Pendleton after the Fall of Saigon, immediately placing a massive Vietnamese population near Orange County. With the allure employment opportunities and available land, North Orange County quickly became home to the largest Vietnamese population outside of Vietnam. It became a space safe for Vietnamese people to open restaurants, which over time became culinary destinations for outsiders and helped popularize dishes like pho and bánh mì. 
 While traditional Vietnamese food was popular within these communities, it did not take long for cooks to adopt the food that surrounded them, as they did centuries prior with French cuisine. With the large population of Vietnamese immigrants present in Louisiana, the Vietnamese style of preparing seafood and Cajun cuisines merged to become Viet-Cajun food. 
Inside The Boiling Crab, my friends and I were greeted with signature covered walls and loud hip-hop music, something of a strip mall oddity. Larger paper tablecloths served as plates as we ordered round after round of seafood, all served in a plastic bag full of broth and spices. It’s an exciting and unusual restaurant experience, with little but a roll of paper towels to assist you with the meal, but it’s a memorable one, even four years later. 
Eating Vietnamese crawfish is a messy process; there is no silverware, just an abundance of oil and spice. Regardless of the mess, Vietnamese-Cajun food became wildly popular in Houston and other Vietnamese communities during the late ‘90s because of both the familiarity of flavors and the novelty of the dish. A meal, a show and a bonding activity all on its own, the Vietnamese crawfish boil was an unstoppable force.
While Vietnamese-Cajun crawfish was developed in New Orleans, it became a business enterprise in Little Saigon, Orange County. The first Viet-Cajun restaurant to crop up in Orange County is a now-booming restaurant empire The Boiling Crab, owned by Houston transplant Dada Ngo. Prior to its two-year anniversary, Viet-Cajun crawfish had exploded onto the Little Saigon food scene. Restaurants like Rockin’ Crawfish, Cajun Islands, The Kickin’ Crab and countless others also foster crowds of devoted spicy seafood fans.
Those who flock to these restaurants trade concerns about authenticity and heritage for passion toward new and exciting tastes. Eating messy seafood out of the bag or off the tray with nothing but a bib and a roll of paper towels as a buffer is exciting, regardless of cultural background. 
Vietnamese-Cajun food is a promising message that immigrants to the United States do not have to sacrifice their heritage to be successful, and that, in fact, unique cultural foods can be much more successful than monotonous American classics. Like tacos made with ground beef and cheddar cheese, Vietnamese immigrants recreated their seafood with the swamp crustaceans abundantly found in their new homes, creating a new style of food in the process. 
These restaurants are both something familiar and something foreign. Families who grew up in Vietnam flock to these restaurants for the familiar flavors and the Vietnamese staff, while families who grew up in the U.S. are attracted to the novelty of a fusion food from seemingly disparate ends of the world. It isn’t an Americanized version of a motherland dish, like orange chicken or the hard-shell taco. Instead, Viet-Cajun food forges its own path through the culinary world, carving out spaces for other Asian-influenced cuisines to follow.

“I consider myself a collaborator,” Los Angeles-based media artist and professor April Greiman said at her talk at the Roski School of Art and Design. Grieman spoke at the brand new graduate MFA design studio Tuesday.  
Nestled in the heart of Los Angeles’ Arts District, this new facility — a transformed warehouse complete with glass paneling, brick walls and an ergonomic floor plan — provided the perfect backdrop for Greiman’s discussion on the intersection of fine art and design. 
According to Greiman, art and design have a beautiful, complex bond that strikes parallels with the perspective all creative disciplines share. She says art needs time to be breathe and live; it needs time to be conceptualized and completed. On the other hand, design has parameters. Art is for the artist, and design is not — a sentiment Greiman has come to understand through first-hand experience.
“Art is reaching a higher level of thinking and making,” Greiman said. “Design has deadlines, a budget and a client.”  
Greiman is an artist, designer and author best known for her work integrating technology and art. She is known for straddling the lines between art, technology, space and color in a way that transcends any singular medium. 
She has created designs for the Olympic Games, Los Angeles Wilshire Vermont Station, MAK Center for Art and Architecture, AOL/Time Warner and Microsoft, while her art has been exhibited at museums and galleries like the Centre Pompidou in Paris, The Museum of Modern Art and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. She joined Roski as a faculty member in January.  
Greiman was also the first woman to design an official United States postage stamp in commemoration of the 19th Amendment — the result of the women’s suffrage movement. During her talk, Greiman touched on how her identity as a woman shaped her career and shared her experiences working with abusive male superiors.
“[I] wanted to call out a lot of dudes, famous dudes, for abuse, but like a lot of women, [I] buried it,” Greiman said. 
Despite the hardships, Greiman said she has found wonderful collaborators within the field. She has created a space for herself and other women to thrive.
Artist and designer Channin Fulton attended the talk and said she made the trek from San Diego all the way up to the Roski MFA design studio to hear the talk because of Greiman’s reputation as a female leader in the industry. Specifically, Fulton said she admires the way Greiman balances being an artist and a designer.
“[I admire how] she finds the space between design and art, and how [she has] that conversation to educate clients about how good design takes time,” Fulton said.
When asked what advice she would give budding designers, visual artists and creatives, Greiman gave her response: “I don’t have any advice, I’m old enough to know not to give any.”

During course registration there’s likely no website as popular as RateMyProfessors. According to its website, students have written 19 million ratings of over 1.7 million professors from more than 7,500 schools. It boasts being the “highest trafficked site for quickly researching and rating professors.” As the largest, most accessible way to read reviews of professors, this website is like the college students’ Bible, helping them decide which classes and instructors to take. 
RateMyProfessors is an anonymous feedback platform which anyone can contribute to — no verification needed — for students to rate professors. Students can rate a professor’s overall quality out of five, state whether they would take the professor again and evaluate the level of difficulty on a five-point scale. There are also optional tags, such as “tough grader” or “respected” or “amazing lectures.” Commenters can also write comments, similar to a Facebook post, about any additional information he or she wants to share. There even used to be a “spiciness” rating for students to rate the physical attractiveness of an educator — but that feature was removed last year following backlash from those rated on the site, particularly female professors, who said the feature enabled sexism and objectification in teacher reviews. 
At the end of the semester — once students have a full picture of a course — students should be mandated to anonymously fill out a review of the professors whose courses they completed. If students do not fill out reviews, repercussions could include a hold on student accounts (similar to financial holds) or however else each department sees fit. It would also be reasonable to mandate faculty peer evaluations as well. The USC Center for Excellence in Teaching offers professional templates for schools and departments implementing peer reviews to improve teaching practices. 
The first issue with using RateMyProfessors is that only the strongly opinionated are motivated to leave reviews. As a result, the reviews are always written by students who either hated or loved their educators. the site is a space to either kiss the professor’s feet or publicly lash them, not a space to provide objective feedback. This notion is backed up by a psychological phenomena called volunteer bias. Though it’s hard to statistically gauge the impact of volunteer bias, according to the Catalogue of Bias, “[When] the sample consists of volunteers, the risk is that they are not representative of the general population.” Thus, RateMyProfessors can only offer a limited perspective on what it is like to experience a class. 
Student reviews are also often impacted by implicit bias. Certain stereotypes affect the understanding of others and their actions at an unconscious level. A Texas Tech University study showed that male professors are more likely to be analyzed for qualifications and competence, whereas female professors are more likely to be reviewed for personality and appearance. Another study by a Colgate University professor found that student evaluations consistently favor “white, cisgender, American born men.” These personal biases are something that students need to be aware of when reading reviews. 
A few, but not all, departments at USC require student reviews. Nevertheless, those reviews are not made accessible to students. There was a way to find course evaluations online through MyUSC, but that feature no longer appears. The way to combat snarky, immature feedback that students rely on is to have a system for USC students to review professors. 
While it is going to take more than a new survey to erase implicit bias from student evaluations, questions can be more objective than those on RateMyProfessors. Questions that really matter, such as ones that focus on professors’ preferred method of instruction or professors’ strengths could produce useful answers. There can be more quantitative evaluations, such as categories scored on a five-point scale that are complemented by written comments that offer insight into what the numbers mean. The administrators running the website could screen for personal comments that are irrelevant to teaching to make the system fairer. 
It’s important to have professor reviews so that students can make choices that better accommodate their learning styles. Furthermore, professors should utilize constructive criticism from their students to become stronger teachers. Universities can use these reviews to improve departments and courses.
An unbiased review system will be challenging to implement, but is worth the effort since students use reviews regardless. In-house reviews will offer a more statistically accurate perspective than a crowdsourced website ever could.

Covering politics can be one of the hardest jobs for journalists — politics are inherently divisive in America, every word said about a politician is intensely scrutinized and journalists’ portrayal of political candidates can have a significant impact on the results of the election. 
During the 2016 election, all of this was intensified to an unprecedented degree — the presidential candidates were more divisive than ever before and journalists’ daily hot takes on the smallest moments of each campaign were a significant driving force throughout the run-up. 
The media failed Americans in 2016. Candidates’ appearances and scandals were at the forefront of news cycles, instead of the policies they’d implement if they were elected. Too much coverage focused on the horse race — who led polls, who didn’t — and too many predictions about who would win were made (of course, nearly everyone in the media was ultimately wrong about the election result). Journalists, in the name of objectivity, fell into the traps of “both sides” arguments. 
The 2020 election cycle is upon us, and news media organizations need to make sure they don’t fall into the same traps they did while covering the 2016 election.
To start, news media organizations need to reform the tone and content of their coverage. According to the Harvard Kennedy School Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, 71% of news stories about the 2016 presidential nominees were negative — a result of a steady increase in negativity since at least 1960. 
By covering elections as such, voters are no longer thinking about what candidate they want to see representing them in office — instead, they’re forced to consider which candidate they hate the most. 
Journalists might say the negative coverage isn’t their fault — it’s the candidates’ personal problems and problems within their campaign. But that argument ignores the pattern of increasing negativity the Shorenstein Center found. 
Negativity comes not from who the candidates are, but from the types of stories journalists choose to cover. The Shorenstein Center reported that in 2016, 42% of election stories focused on the horse race and 17% focused on controversies. Only 10% of election coverage was about candidates’ policy positions. 
Controversies are usually inherently negative stories, and horse race coverage tends to focus on how campaign moves will (negatively) affect the respective candidates. If the news media shifted its focus toward policy stances instead, not only would the tone of coverage become more balanced, but it would also serve voters better. 
The purpose of democracy is to give citizens the ability to select a candidate who will effect change in the areas citizens care most about. When candidates’ actual policy matters are reduced to the general views of the party they are affiliated with, voters are unable to decide who they’re voting for based on which candidate will actually address their needs as citizens. In 2016, the lack of policy coverage meant voters were largely making decisions based solely on party affiliation, the candidates’ personalities and the  controversies surrounding them.
When 2020 comes, the media needs to make a concerted effort to focus coverage on policy stances instead of horse race and controversy politics.Furthermore, journalists need to reframe their coverage of elections to avoid “both sides” journalism. Objectivity is one of the first cardinal rules taught to budding journalists — it’s the duty of journalists to report stories accurately and fairly. 
But when it comes to elections, covering something “fairly” can be reduced to getting statements from each campaign, then presenting them together with equal weight. 
Whenever President Donald Trump was embroiled in scandal during the 2016 election, his supporters would use “What about her emails?” as a defense — often equating major, consequential scandals to what should’ve been a relatively small controversy. Just because Trump and his allies brought it up so often, Clinton’s email scandal was blown out of proportion and reduced the amount of scrutiny Trump’s numerous scandals should have received from the media. 
In 2020, the media needs to ensure that its coverage isn’t controlled by what candidates say, but rather focuses on keeping candidates independently accountable and prioritizing coverage of their policies. 
2016 was a mistake for the news media and many lost trust in outlets they previously relied on; 2020 is an opportunity for journalists to rebuild that trust and redefine political reporting as trustworthy and informative.

The Jesse Unruh Institute for Politics, in partnership with ProCon.org and Italian American Lawyers Association, hosted a discussion on the future of the Republican Party under the Trump administration.
The panel featured Anthony Scaramucci, former Trump White House director of communications, and Mike Murphy, Center for the Political Future co-director and GOP consultant. Former Democratic California Assemblyman Mike Gatto moderated the event. 
Scaramucci talked about his book “Trump, The Blue-Collar President,” the title of which refers to President Donald Trump securing the support of America’s working class during the 2016 election and into his presidency. Scaramucci clarified that though the president was far from a blue-collar person in his upbringing and status, Trump has great influence over this demographic.  
“He hijacked the Republican Party from the party’s establishment,” Scaramucci said. “He took it from party leaders that don’t like him … He reached into the blue-collar workers and stole a good part of their base.”
Scaramucci also spoke about his brief time working in the White House in July.
“I didn’t realize the dynamics in politics are so drastically different from business,” Scaramucci said. “I thought people that were on the same team with me we were going to work together. It turns out you shoot each other, you shoot to kill in politics.”
Scaramucci also offered advice to young people, reflecting on the expletive-ladened interview with The New Yorker that cost him his job after 11 days. 
“If you’re making a mistake, own the mistake,” he said. “Be accountable for the mistake. Don’t pass it on … Forgive yourself.”
Murphy said the Republican Party needs to appeal to a more diverse range of voters in order to get more support in the 2020 election. 
“We’re up against demography,” Murphy said. “That is a lousy fight to be in … we’re the party of old people … that’s what we have to fix.” 
Scaramucci said Republican voters don’t respond well when Trump makes negative remarks about other prominent figures and politicians. He said Trump will need to take a more moderate approach if he wants to garner support for reelection.  
“He’s got great communication skills, but he goes into areas stylistically that I think really really hurt him with people,“ Scaramucci said. “If he dialed back levels of his personality or softened his image like he did at the State of the Union address … his poll numbers [would] go up.”
Will Borie, a sophomore majoring in computer science, attended the event to hear Scaramucci speak about his role in the White House. 
“I thought it was really fun to see him disagree a lot with Mike Murphy,” Borie said. “It’s clear they’re in different camps in the Republican Party … It’s good to see there’s good debate going on within the party.”

El Centro Chicano was renamed La CASA after Latinx students petitioned last spring for a more inclusive name. The change was announced Wednesday by Student Affairs and will officially go into effect in Fall 2019.
La CASA, which means “the home” in Spanish, stands for Latinx Chicanx Center for Advocacy and Student Affairs. The name was suggested last April during a town hall hosted by USC Latinx organizations about the potential name change.
“We understand the history of the center and why it was founded, and we want to respect that,” El Centro Chicano director Billy Vela told USC News. “The Chicano name remains, and we want to build on that. The community has grown and now includes many different voices. Our current students want to be heard and want to be identified.”
The new name was selected through collaboration between El Centro Chicano, Central American Network, Latinx Student Assembly and Latino/a Graduate Student Association.
“The core group took all perspectives into consideration and sought to find balance between the legacy established by the founders of El Centro Chicano while also affirming the diversity of the Latinx Diaspora it currently represents,” a press release from Student Affairs read.
In Spring 2018, El Centro Chicano held conversations about the potential name change where students, faculty and alumni gave their input on why the change was necessary and on what their expectations would be for the new name. These conversations took place after the Central American Network released a petition in February 2018 calling for further inclusivity and for the cultural center to drop the term “Chicano.” Nearly 300 students signed it.
“The [new] name is the most inclusive term we could use,” graduate student Lenora Quiñónez told USC News. “We didn’t want to step on any toes.”
The term Chicano has typically been used to exclusively refer to Mexican Americans, especially in the 1960s during the Chicano movement, which advocated for Mexican American civil rights.
“Chicano is a history that cannot be forgotten,” LGSA president Jose Richard Avices told USC News. “We are not removing Chicano. This is more of an addition.”

The Environmental Student Assembly held its annual Spring Sustainability Forum at Parkside Performance Cafe Wednesday. Nearly 40 students, faculty and staff members attended the event, which marked the first official planning session for the University’s Sustainability 2028 Plan.
The forum focused on four major sustainability areas —energy, water, waste and transportation — and informed attendees about USC’s progress in each, as well as the state and city regulations the University is required to follow.
Ellen Dux, the Office of Sustainability’s only paid employee, programmed the event. She deemed it a “home run,” citing the large turnout and high level of audience engagement on all four topics. 
“When I started a year ago, collectively everybody said, … ‘The University doesn’t care about sustainability,’” Dux said. “We should be getting as many people from this University community to understand what we’re doing, what we’re not doing and why we should be doing more of it — and caring about it.” 
Dux emphasized the need for student engagement in sustainability. The Office’s 2028 Plan survey also launched Wednesday, which she said is the most effective way for the community to effect change in the University’s approach to sustainability.
Facilities Management Services Energy Manager Zelinda Welch gave the first presentation, discussing USC’s current energy usage and how it will change in the future. 
Welch listed a number of state and city regulations that apply to USC, including State Senate Bill 100. Passed last August, SB 100 accelerates the state’s energy efficiency goals, eventually leading to 100% renewable or carbon-free energy across California by 2045. 
According to Welch, 30% of the energy USC currently uses is drawn from renewable sources, which is solely due to the renewable energy sources that have been provided by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.  
According to the Office of Sustainability’s website, USC operates small-scale solar installations only at a couple off-site facilities. The University Park Campus’ renewable energy efforts rely primarily on energy-efficient lighting systems and a water-chilling tank of 3 million gallons located under Cromwell Athletics Field. The tank  serves over 70 buildings on campus.
Mark Malan, an accounting technician in the Provost’s office, asked Welch about the University’s reluctance to incorporate solar power into its renewable energy efforts. 
Historically, USC has said that solar energy is not as effective or cheap as other options, according to multiple attendees. The Office of Sustainability’s website lists seven reasons to not incorporate solar energy. One reason is that many buildings cannot physically support solar installations, which would take up about 10% of any given building’s energy needs if installed. 
“I’d be very excited to see solar on the campus,” Welch said. “Energy efficiency projects, in many ways, make more sense before you get to solar.”
According to associate history professor Joshua Goldstein, who attended the forum, students and faculty have been pushing for an off-site solar system at Galen Center for at least six years. He said students brought in workers from EcoMotion, a sustainability solutions company, for a consultation to assess the feasibility of installing solar panels on top of the center. 
According to a 2015 post on EcoMotion’s website, USC actually hired the company, but Goldstein was not sure about the details of why the plan eventually fell through. 
“The roof is one of the best for solar that EcoMotion solar experts Strand, Ware and Lowell-Britt have ever seen,” the website read.
The Daily Trojan previously reported that students from ESA’s Environmental Core formed a USC Go Solar campaign in 2014, which held multiple rallies and garnered hundreds of signatures on petitions demanding that USC install solar panels on- and/or off-campus. The last rally was held in November 2017, according to Environmental Core’s Facebook page. 
Karen Reed, an FMS program manager, spoke about the University’s efforts in water conservation. She said the University formed a water conservation task force in response to the California drought, which drove former Gov. Jerry Brown to issue a state of emergency in 2014. 
Reed said that since 2015, USC Housing has installed nearly 6,800 low-flow fixtures that significantly reduce water usage in on- and off-campus housing. She said FMS has identified 1,200 fixtures — faucets, toilets and showerheads — in non-housing buildings to eventually replace, as well. 
According to Reed, as of January, USC has completed all of the main infrastructure required to begin using recycled water for irrigation and cooling towers, which she said will save the University around 19% in savings. She said LADWP estimates a delivery date sometime in 2024 for the water to be used. 
Administrative Operations Executive Director Mark Ewalt, who oversees the Office of Sustainability, cited this infrastructure, which he referred to as the “purple pipe,” as an example of a sustainability effort employed by the University that was not mandated by the city or state. 
“That’s something that we took on our own because we knew that’s the best way to spend money for water reduction,” Ewalt said. 
Multiple campus sustainability leaders said the appointment of President-elect Carol Folt, an environmental scientist, has made them hopeful about USC’s future. In Fall 2016, Folt launched the “Three Zeros Environmental Initiative” at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. According to the University’s website, the initiative moves the campus toward water and gas neutrality, as well as zero waste production. 
ESA co-director Nathaniel Hyman said Folt’s appointment has stimulated a new sense of optimism throughout ESA and other sustainability groups on campus. 
“If we can match the newfound optimism … with student body engagement, that will send the message to the Board of Trustees that we’re serious,” Hyman said. “For years, we felt like we were screaming into the wind … because our sustainability efforts are brand new.”
