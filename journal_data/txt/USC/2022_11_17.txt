The world loves a woman in pain. There is simply some inexplicable, inherent beauty in the melancholy experienced by women. Entwined with fragility, it almost carries an air of superiority: the sensitivity is profound; the frailty becoming; the vulnerability appealing — even alluring.
We see the wounded woman everywhere. In the recently released and deeply controversial film “Blonde” (2022),  which quickly became Netflix’s No.1 movie after its debut, we once again witness Hollywood and the world’s obsession with female pain, even in death. Andrew Dominik, the writer-director of “Blonde,” treats Marilyn Monroe as nothing more than a victim, focusing solely on the traumas Monroe endured throughout her life. In the movie, if Monroe is not crying, she is naked — and there are many times she’s both.
As Manohla Dargis, the co-chief film critic of the New York Times puts it, “All that’s missing from this portrait is, well, everything else, including Monroe’s personality and inner life, her intelligence, her wit and savvy and tenacity; her interest in — and knowledge of — politics; the work that she put in as an actress and the true depth of her professional ambitions.”
“Blonde” should come as no surprise, however, as Hollywood’s necrophiliac obsession with women’s trauma is immemorial. Just three years ago, “Judy”(2019) was released, a biopic which has a plot bleakly similar to “Blonde’s.” The film follows beloved Hollywood star Judy Garland and her troubled life with mental illness and unhappy marriages.
But this preoccupation with the wounded woman — or as I’d like to call it, the “sad girl,” — is not just found in Hollywood, but everywhere. Are you a fan of literature? Look no further than Sylvia Plath or Virginia Woolf. Like to listen to pop music? My go-to-sad-girl is Lana Del Rey, but if you’re looking for more variety there are countless other familiar names in the official Spotify-curated playlist titled “sad girl starter pack,” which has almost a million likes.
Even my Instagram feed now is occasionally (frequently) taken over by post-cry teary-eyed but still beautiful selfies and mirror selfies of girls — a trend started by model Bella Hadid, whose crying selfies drew tremendous media attention. Even the “crying makeup” look has become TikTok’s latest trend, featuring girls with blushy cheeks, reddened noses, soft and puffy lips and most importantly, a glisten in her eyes that make her appear on the verge of crying.
Indeed, the “crying makeup” trend is the epitome of all that is wrong with the sad girl aesthetic, which has been around for almost 10 years now. With its sad, ethereal, and impossibly perfect post-cry look, quite literally, artificially manufactured by make-up, it is a misrepresentation of what female sadness actually looks like. I don’t know about you, but when I cry, my mascara gets everywhere, my eyes are puffy, lips swollen, skin blotchy — trust me, the last thing I want to do is to take a selfie and post it on Instagram.
Unlike the unrealistic and extremely aestheticized pretty-crying trope depicted by numerous downtrodden Hollywood heroines, women in real life do not cry while daintily wiping away a singular, glistening tear as it gently rolls down her rosy cheeks. Our tears are fierce and almost violent, fueled with rage, hurt and grief. It is an unapologetic outcry, not a suppressed, performative act of frailty. The real, implied message behind the sad girl aesthetic is this: suppress your real rage and ache, because even when you cry, your mascara has to stay on point.
The real logic behind the appeal of female suffering is to be sad is to be powerless. The pain of women turns them into birdies and kittens, delicate and vulnerable, into rosy sunsets and sordid red satin goddesses — its beauty fleeting and with a mark of decay. It pales women. It disempowers women. But we can’t look away — we can’t imagine new ways for them to hurt.  
This was especially apparent during the Victorian Period of the 19th century. Women were placed into a domestic role as they were seen as too physically weak to work in the public sphere. While their pale thin bodies decay from tuberculosis, their fragility was perceived as beauty like a set of porcelain dolls.  Years, decades and more than a century have gone by since the nihilistic 19th-century sentiment which mapped the appeal of the female suffering onto illness, combining sadness and beauty all at once. Yet, today, in 2022, we still aestheticize, romanticize, glamorize and fetishize female pain.
Stop romanticizing a woman’s pain. Turning pain into but another object of beauty is a fundamental disservice to all the power and force that was quietly contained in woman’s pain in the long history of women fighting against the patriarchy’s oppression. Protest doesn’t have to be external to the body — the pain itself can be seen as not an act of passivity, but an active tool for resistance and agency.
The logic behind the aestheticization of women’s pain implies that suffering is not only an aspect of the experience but also an element of the woman constitution; that pain is a requirement of femininity, and glue and prerequisite of a woman’s consciousness.
Our tears are not quiet, weak, stupid or shameful. Our tears could not be further away from beauty — they are forceful, sometimes even rageful, and they yield scars full of stories. Stare into the female pain, anguish, and suffering and you will be chilled.

The “lost generation” refers to the generation that experienced adulthood during the aftermath of World War I. Psychologists labeled these individuals based on their disoriented and directionless feelings regarding the post-war era and what the future of America would hold for them. Former President Warren G. Harding claimed that America needed “not nostrums, but normalcy” to alter the perspective of humanity. 
Today, America copes with another new road to normalcy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic. But in lieu of a lost generation rises a generation that redefines what it means to be American. And I am proud to be a part of it — despite popular sentiments otherwise. 
Gen Z consists of individuals born from 1997 to 2012 and is changing the world. We are often categorized as the lazy and coddled generation that is technology dependent and sensitive to society. We “romanticize everything” and are ignorant of our peers. But in reality, we represent the leading edge of the country’s changing racial and ethnic makeup. We are activists for climate change, gun control and mental health. We are smart, creative and united. We are loud and refuse to be silenced. 
While Gen Z is often perceived as hyper-sensitive to mental health, politics, and social issues, in reality, this “hyper-sensitivity” is a great awareness and social consciousness that push many to engage in difficult conversations. Rather than perpetuating the idea that mental health is taboo, the generation has begun to destigmatize it over the past decade, speaking up for themselves and others and spreading awareness of the detrimental effects of mental health. It’s not us being sensitive, it’s us being supportive. We are conscious and aware of the prejudice our generation faces. We care about each other’s emotions and the importance of mental health. If being sensitive means sticking up for people that face discrimination based on their identity, then we should embrace it together. 
Despite experiencing a constant assault on our political norms, the drawbacks and harm done by the digitalization of their lives and firsthand experiences of issues such as climate change, we refuse to give up and continue to spread empathy when we can. While we are far from perfect, our motives are strictly guided by efforts to change the future and rewrite history. 
Gen Z is passionate about politics and uses social media as a platform to amplify our voices. We are “tech-savvy” as the only generation that has never seen a world without technological advancement and the formation of a digital world. But we use these platforms to our advantage to be more aware of our surroundings and active within our communities. The easy access to information via social media has promoted a greater need and desire to gather more resources to expand our thinking. While the instant gratification that is often mistaken for a lazy alternative to thinking and the drawbacks of living in a digitalized world for almost all of their life, Gen Z is much more than a generation of socially media-obsessed friends. 
From the #MeToo movement to protest sexual harassment and the #BlackOutTuesday that spread awareness about  the Black Lives Matter protests, we connect online and build a stronger society that demands change. We start trends and discussions. We offer insight and share opinions, ideas and beliefs. We are united and fearless in our efforts to speak out together. We are able to connect and listen to other people and their identities through social media. We are educated by our peers and find value in our diversity and differences.  
The Gen Z perspective will continue to thrive and influence the future of America. Our determination and passion will not be belittled by the slander we receive. We must continue to persevere. 
We truly are, one in a Zillion.

Bathed in blue and red lights, Tommy’s Place transformed from a concert venue into a debate forum for the USC Center for the Political Future’s semiannual political debate Tuesday. Students from the Trojan Democrats and the USC GOP discussed pressing issues such as the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state of free speech on Twitter.   
The debate — co-sponsored the Political Student Assembly and the Political Union — was co-moderated by Darik de Jong, a junior majoring in philosophy, politics and economics and president of the Political Union, and Sophia Perez, a junior majoring in political science and executive director of the Political Student Assembly. 
Perez said the format of this debate differed from previous years: the total time per round was shortened, and there are more structured opportunities for cross debate.
“In the past, we’ve had some moments where debaters would run out of things to say at the end of the cross debate,” Perez said. “We altered it a little bit to have two questions on the same topic, but to provide more nuance to the topic we were addressing.”
The debate centered around four topics: the politicization of the U.S Supreme Court, U.S. inflation, criminal justice and the censorship of political figures. The Political Union and Political Student Assembly chose the topics based on polling data regarding issues that concern Gen Z voters the most, according to Kevina Collins, a senior majoring in history and political science and director of public affairs for the Political Student Assembly. Each round, a new representative from each side debated the topic for 20 minutes total before moving on.
During the first round, students debated whether or not the Supreme Court has become politicized, especially with a 6-3 conservative supermajority emerging in the court after the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett in 2020. The second portion of the round focused on the Dobbs v. Jackson decision which removed the constitutional protection for abortion.
Juan Pablo Moreland, a sophomore majoring in philosophy, politics and economics, represented  the USC GOP side for this round.
“Speaking itself was pretty nerve-racking . . . It was pretty much my first experience ever doing something like that,” Moreland said. “Everyone else did pretty well. It was entertaining to hear the arguments or some more heated discussions after me. It was cool to be up there.” 
Following the discussion surrounding the Supreme Court and abortion was an equally topical conversation surrounding inflation in the U.S., especially after midterm polls revealed inflation to be a top concern among voters. John Ostling, a junior majoring in history, noted that the second round became tense between the two debaters. 
“In the end, [the speaker from the USC GOP] was almost rude,” Ostling said. “The whole debate was pretty mild-mannered and respectful . . . I felt [the second round] was sort of a low point during the debate.”
Midterm voters also displayed concern over crime and safety.  FBI data noted that murders rose nearly 30% from 2019 to 2020 — the largest single-year increase in the U.S. in over a century. The next round addressed potential causes for these concerns, as well as the topic of police reform. 
With Elon Musk’s $44 billion purchase of Twitter in October 2022, the following round’s focus on the regulation of free speech in private social media platforms proved especially relevant. Debaters discussed whether or not the ban of former President Donald Trump on Twitter was a violation of the First Amendment, and to what extent public figures should be scrutinized for their speech. 
Ashlee Williams, a senior majoring in law, history and culture and art history, found a comment from the USC GOP speaker concerning.
“[The debater mentioned that] ‘People could have owned slaves, and I don’t think they are  bad [people],’ which is, of course, a very tenuous argument,” Williams said. “That demonstrates how some of these issues are just debate topics for people without being grounded in reality, without being grounded in the truth of these topics . . . in people’s real lives.”
Williams said a few students walked out of the debate room upon hearing this comment. Once the debate ended, students including Williams confronted the speaker and voiced their opinions.
“Several students of different backgrounds went and talked to that particular debater, and he engaged in conversation with some of them,” Williams said. “He was respectful enough to answer questions about his statements. I think that’s something to note for sure, and I definitely appreciate that.”
Moreland said the comment was not a reflection of the entire performance of the USC GOP’s side of the debate.
The Political Union and Political Student Assembly have started the process of taking all feedback from debaters and attendees into consideration. An official statement is forthcoming. 
“Regardless of how previous debates have gone, and how this one may have been perceived, I think it’s important to continue civic discourse on campus among both the Trojan Dems and USC GOP,” Collins said. “Having debaters speak in front of students is important to growing civic engagement. I was really glad to see students showing up.”

A group of researchers from the Keck School of Medicine received a $3.7 million grant from the National Institute on Aging to investigate the link between Type 2 diabetes and a higher risk of developing dementia in 200 Hispanic adults between the ages 50 and 65. 
The study will focus on Hispanic adults, a group that not only has been historically understudied in the medical field, but also has a higher incidence of diabetes due to multiple causes, including environmental factors such as stress and air pollution.
The age demographic of this cohort — 50 to 65 years old — is a period of life where there can be changes in the glucose tolerance of adults due to Type 2 diabetes, but before the cognitive decline associated with dementia begins.
“Ultimately, we are trying to establish biomarkers that can be reversed,” said Dr. Hussein Yassine, an associate professor of medicine at the Keck School of Medicine and co-principal investigator of the study. “So let’s say you’ve got somebody with diabetes or prediabetes, and you reverse diabetes by weight loss or by medication. Does that translate into the brain getting better? Does that translate into [a] lower [incidence of] Alzheimer’s diseases?” 
Dr. Yassine and his team will begin recruiting the study cohort soon, which will be comprised of Hispanic people both with and without Type 2 diabetes, a form of diabetes which tends to develop during adulthood. From there, participants will take cognitive tests conducted by Dr. Yassine and Dr. Lina D’Orazio, an assistant professor of clinical neurology at Keck and co-investigator of the study. 
Participants will then undergo a blood draw to identify baseline glucose and insulin levels, other testing to identify risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease and an initial resting state fMRI scan — a tool which helps researchers observe how parts of the brain work together.
After preliminary tests are conducted, participants will then undergo the central experiment of this study: drinking a sugary drink. People with diabetes experience a blood sugar spike — known as hyperglycemia — in response to ingesting sugar, which is higher and more prolonged than a person without diabetes — this sugary drink will allow researchers to observe the effect of hyperglycemia on the brain.
“There are some things that you might not be able to see when a person’s system isn’t stressed,” said Dr. Meredith Braskie, an assistant professor of neurology at Keck and co-principal investigator of the study. “But when you’re giving them this glucose drink, it might uncover things that you wouldn’t be able to see otherwise.”
Two hours later, participants will undergo another MRI scan and another blood draw to find a potential link between the brain and blood response to the glucose drink.
Dr. Matthew Borzage, an assistant professor of research pediatrics at Keck and co-principal investigator of the study, will help analyze cerebrovascular reactivity — a measure of how well blood vessels expand to let more blood through in response to a stimulus. Researchers will also perform neuroimaging analysis of the blood-brain barrier and conduct arterial spin labeling, a process that measures blood flow in the brain.
Observing the brain’s response to hyperglycemia, the researchers suggest, is a potential way of identifying a link between adults with Type 2 diabetes and dementia. After two years, the participants will return to undergo more cognitive testing and brain scans.
“In this way, we can look at the different measures that we’re measuring at baseline,” Dr. Braskie said, “[We can] look at how their brain is responding to glucose and see to what extent those measures are predicting longitudinal changes in our brain or cognition.”
The study operates under both the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Institute, which helps facilitate aspects of the study such as neuropsychological testing, recruitment and community outreach, and USC’s Mary Stevens Neuroimaging and Informatics Institute, where the MRI scanning will take place. 
Community outreach is particularly important in addressing the historical injustices faced by the Hispanic community, said Dr. Yassine, who works with patients in the demographic often in his clinic in East Los Angeles.
“What we have discovered out of experience is that if we have full-time staff in the community, having events, talking about Alzheimer’s, talking about diabetes, building relationships, answering questions to get their trust,” Dr. Yassine said, “they’re willing to [go] the extra mile.”
Although much of the study has yet to take place, the researchers hope to use this critical period in the lives of people with and without Type 2 diabetes to identify a measurable indicator of dementia in people with diabetes — a biomarker — which may be used as an intervention point to help in the development of early treatments for dementia.
“Being able to see [biomarkers] in the short term,” Dr. Borzage said, “and [knowing] that they should lead to long-term improvements in a community that really deserves that same level of attention and care is really exciting.”

As Jennette McCurdy entered the Tutor Campus Center Ballroom Tuesday night, the room erupted with applause, excited to see a lifelong friend after so many years. A former child actor most known for her role as Sam in Nickelodeon’s “iCarly,” many Trojans grew up watching McCurdy throughout their childhoods.
Changing the narrative from former child actor, McCurdy released the New York Times bestseller “I’m Glad My Mom Died” in August. Describing writing as something that feels the most authentic to her, McCurdy’s memoir details her multifaceted and complicated relationship with her mother and her experiences forced into the entertainment industry at such a young age.
The Undergraduate Student Government Speaker’s Committee, Academic Culture Assembly, Student Assembly for Gender Empowerment, Performing Arts Committee and Special Events Committee organized the event. 
Sitting down for a conversation with attendees, McCurdy answered questions about her personal experiences in the entertainment industry and how it negatively affected her mental health.
McCurdy discussed how her mother forced her to be an actress to live vicariously through her, 
because her mother had a lifelong dream of being an actress. She opened up about the negative repercussions of being a child actor such as dealing with eating disorders, the fear of rejection, her journey with therapy and other mental illnesses. 
Mallory Norton, a freshman majoring in architecture, said there are benefits of such open discussion of mental illness.
“To make something so normal, normal… makes people feel less horrible about things that they can’t control,” Norton said.  “[McCurdy] is so open and so honest about anxiety and her mental health struggles is really important.”
According to the American Psychological Association’s Healthy Minds Study, more than 60% of college students meet the criteria for at least one mental health problem. 
“I think it is just really important to make people feel [mental struggles] are normal,” Norton said. “Someone who’s so famous and has had all these incredible achievements has also struggled with things that the average Joe has.” 
McCurdy also opened up about her extensive journey in therapy, saying that her six-year journey helped her gain perspective on the trauma from her past. Beyond recognizing her past struggles, therapy helped McCurdy handle her complicated grief with the death of her mother, anxiety, her eating disorder and the press.
“Discussion about mental health encourages conversations between other people, so that you can relate your own experiences and empathize with other people and seek the help that you need,” said Bella Childre, a freshman majoring in health and human sciences, about the significance of the event. 
One of the biggest obstacles McCurdy faced was the complicated grief that she went through after the death of her mother. Grieving the person who raised her but also taught her how to restrict calories at the age of 11 was tough for McCurdy, she said. 
“[McCurdy is] trying to destigmatize therapy, and I thought it was overall a really great conversation, definitely different from her like ‘iCarly’ days. She’s a lot more mature,” said Jefferson Nguyen, a graduate student studying aerospace engineering. 
McCurdy recounted how she was described as a “little adult,” despite being a six-year-old during her first acting project. Being a child actor forced her to grow up fast which, in turn, stunted her maturity during her adolescence, leaving her stuck in that “little adult” phase. 
“Everybody looked at Sam [McCurdy’s role in iCarly] and was like, ‘Oh yeah, she’s cool.’  Everybody wanted to be best friends with Sam, and seeing somebody that everyone loves, being so normal, makes it really special and really connects you to her,” Norton said.
McCurdy also spoke on her successful reinvention from child actor to New York Times bestselling writer. From her weekly bombardment from people on the street yelling “Sam, fried chicken!,” to people now sharing how her book helped them overcome mental struggles and eating disorders, McCurdy has asserted and found herself outside of her previous roles.
Childre agrees with McCurdy: “To see her after [‘iCarly’] and see how she’s grown into herself was really inspiring, to see that she was able to work through [her mental struggles] in therapy and through the process of writing a book and that you can grow out of negative experiences in a positive manner.”
McCurdy continues to write and is currently undergoing the process of writing a novel, as well continuing her works as a director and a new upcoming project that McCurdy exclaimed is her favorite thus far.

It’s convenient to group all non-white people under the “POC” umbrella. It’s even easier to promote POC-conscious, POC-motivated and POC-favoring things as if they serve every non-white person. The problem is we are now at a cultural standstill when it comes to addressing race. We’ve decided to highlight and celebrate people of color, without understanding why we even have the term. 
Grouping every non-white person under the term “POC” only perpetuates the idea that there is a binary of perspectives when it comes to racial experience — either white or not white. 
When we talk about race, we still consider white the default, or neutral option. There are the Black and Latinx perspectives, but we are too afraid to acknowledge the White perspective. By shying away from terms that emphasize whiteness, we allow their opinions to float above all of the accounted-for racial bias of others’ opinions. We’ve too often privileged this demographic with the authority to speak wholly on matters as if they are the arbiter of opinions. 
Politically, when we consider the “Black vote” or the “Latinx sentiment,” we quiet a discussion about the “White vote” or “White perspective.” This only furthers a bias that experience is homogenous across one racial demographic. It’s a dangerous paradigm to operate on if we assume that there’s one way to appeal to one race of voters for every group — except for white.
That’s not to say all racial categories are inherently bad. I believe labels can be helpful and even empowering. There’s nothing wrong with analyzing how racial groups vote because it reflects the priorities of a demographic in our racially-divided country. It makes sense that if a law or proposition affects one racial group, the study of how that group votes (regardless of other demographic factors) is relevant. 
However, we’ve taken that analysis too far. Racial groups, including White people, cannot be so standardized that we statistically measure who the “Black opinion” favors in a presidential race. It’s this oversimplification that prevents us from considering racial groups as autonomous, intelligent social actors who hold the power of their own votes. 
This trend is present in journalism as well. We like to discuss how “x group” feels about an issue, without sometimes recognizing that there are compounding factors besides race that contribute to the understanding and effects of the issue.
In NPR’s “Code Switching” podcast, Shereen Marisol Meraji, Natalie Escobar and Kumari Devarajan highlight how terms like POC and BIPOC become increasingly complex when we discuss the real products of racism. They state that, “Many felt that people using the term ‘POC’ were (intentionally or not) sidestepping the truth: That certain effects of racism — things like mass incarceration, police violence, inability to access good health care — disproportionately affect Black and Indigenous people. Not all ‘people of color.’”
I have seen this in my own experience as well. I am a generally White-passing Indian-Irish-American — whatever that means. I find myself, and others like me, at a pause for what we can identify with. As a person of color, I have a lot of weight on me from the oppression that is finally being highlighted by mainstream media. However, to claim the experience or unity with Black Americans would not be a true expression of my identity as a person of color.
The problem is that I feel confined to be either White-passing or person of color. Truly, I am both, but I am not fully either. I cannot claim the entirety of the POC experience because I have never experienced the culture or the treatment of all of the other races under that umbrella. 
If you put every “POC” student at USC together, the group would be so vastly diverse, we would quickly understand that there’s no way to appeal to all of them at once.
I understand the frustration with a changing world that is continuing to expand terms and labels. I believe Gen Z will be the generation to abandon labels like “POC.” We live in a culture that now accepts and celebrates the many, many identities we all have. We are a kaleidoscope of things, and that is good — or at least, it’s ok to admit.
“POC” is a crutch term, and it allows us to feel like we’re uplifting, representing or appeasing a community that is bigger than we can standardize. It’s ok to be specific, even if it makes the world that much more complicated. ​​

Burnout is very real. And, as the true iPad baby I am, my true happiness comes from watching stuff — specifically comedies. I can’t even remember the last time I watched a dramatic show. I’m here for silly little laughs and that’s it. I believe it is my duty to share my curated list of sitcoms and their greatest episodes (so I don’t have to do the whole “I promise it gets better after x amount of seasons” thing) to share the joy with my fellow Trojans who are equally burnt out right now. 
Although I honestly can’t tell you the last time I sat down and watched TV (due to assignments and the fact that I am unable to put down my phone for more than five minutes), here is what I would watch, if I could.
“Taskmaster” – “Melon Buffet” — Season 1, Episode 1
“Taskmaster” is incredible from the very first moment of the very first season. 
One day, I’m going to write an entire article on this show: my absolute favorite show of all time. There are definitely episodes I have watched over 10 times and am willing to watch again. It is my life’s purpose to spread the “Taskmaster” agenda. Each season, or series as they call it in the United Kingdom, involves five of Britain’s top comedians competing in bizarre tasks such as “Make the best music video for a nursery rhyme” and “Make this coconut look like a businessman” to receive points from the almighty Taskmaster. 
You don’t actually need to start with the first season — I personally started with season seven — but series one is one of my all-time favorites for one specific reason: the work of comedian-poet Tim Key. With quick wit and incredible lateral thinking that never leaves a dull moment, Key is my favorite contestant of all time and is sure to make you fall in love with the show. 
I could never do “Taskmaster” justice in such a short blurb, but it’s free to watch on YouTube, so there’s no harm in checking it out. Maybe you can even catch up in time to watch Series 14 before it ends on Dec. 1.
“Community” — “Digital Estate Planning” — Season 3, Episode 20
“Community” is the cult classic I’m sure that one friend talks about all the time, as it follows six community college students that become a Spanish study group as they go through all types of wacky adventures. While there may only be three actually good seasons of the six-season show, you will fall in love with the characters enough that you will each sit through the painful seasons. 
With big names such as Donald Glover and Alison Brie (…and Chevy Chase) and its use of different mediums such as claymation, the show stands out among the other workplace-type comedies that plague the screen (although I love those too.) 
“Digital Estate Planning” is one of those episodes that utilizes a different medium — the characters are put inside an 8-bit-style video game as they compete for Pierce’s (Chase) inheritance. For a 20-minute network sitcom, “Community”’s production and creativity is nothing short of showstopping. The game, “Journey to the Center of Hawkthorne,” is surprisingly expansive, giving the characters a whole new world to explore. Plus, Abed’s romantic subplot with the NPC Hilda is the greatest love story of all time. 
“Modern Family” – “Games People Play” – Season 4, Episode 23
“Modern Family” may be one of the most watched ABC sitcoms of all time, but I still feel like it doesn’t get the love it deserves. Lovable characters in quirky situations — what’s not to love? A mockumentary watching the life of three families for over 10 years, the Dunphy-Tucker-Pritchett family begins to feel like part of your own.   
Choosing a favorite episode is a near impossible task, but “Games People Play” is definitely up there for me. In the episode, Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) becomes the obsessive, competitive parent he hates (going so far as to root for a child to fall off a balance beam), Gloria (Sofia Vegara) and Jay (Ed O’Neill) break in and snoop around their children’s houses and the Dunphy family takes an absolutely disastrous RV road trip. 
It’s also my dad’s favorite episode, so shout out to John. He is the reason I have such obsessive TV habits where I’ll just watch the same episode of the same TV show and never get tired of it. I mean, you can’t say I don’t know what I like. 
I hope this list can maybe provide some comfort during the dreary Los Angeles winter days. And if not, well, I have nothing to offer but my love.

My new favorite TikTok page right now is @joshandmattdesign, a couple in Melbourne, Australia, who create and avidly collect home decor art for their apartment. Ranging from their original ceiling pieces to vintage plant stands to glass snowball candle holders, their apartment is a wonderland for maximalists and my inner child.  
Now, my latest shopping adventures have strayed from boots and funnel-neck wool coats a la Acne Studios to a rabbit hole of interior design instead. Maybe the sudden fixation stems from a slowly growing identity crisis due to my 20th birthday lurking around the corner or maybe it’s because I am searching for a new apartment. Instead of maturing my fashion into handbags and cashmere knit sets, decor has been the front runner.
I am particularly drawn to whimsical and visually interesting pieces; Wax Charms makes unique and handmade candles adorned with crystals, Dauphinette makes lamps out of Japanese bread rolls and baguettes similar to Vincent Olinet’s floating bread slice shelves,  Malang Malang makes the most adorable ceramics,  Teun Zwets hand makes bubble clocks and Georg Jensen makes stainless steel silver eggs that serve as reusable ice cubes. 
Still, while some friends may call me a grandma for this excitement, I find it serene and comforting to know that soon, I get to exist in a space that is reflective of me physically, mentally and spiritually. 
Instead of a room that I just happen to sleep in, it becomes an extension of me as well; it adopts my signature smells — currently Nest’s Madagascar Vanilla and Sun-Drenched Linen 3-Wick candles — and molds its walls to my habits. 
At this point you may be thinking, “I thought I was reading ‘That’s Fashion, Sweetie.’ What does any of this have to do with fashion?” 
It’s because fashion is more than shopping, garments and style; it’s also culture, reflection and transformation. 
And so, just as kissing is the next step after hand holding in middle school dating rules, the next step in understanding someone based on their selected items is seeing someone’s room. 
Clothes only show a pocket of people and who they are: their mood that day, if they shop based on color, pattern or silhouette, and if style emphasizes layers and complexity, function or flare. It’s what they want you to see, whether you’re their part-time lover or a complete stranger.
But a room shows what people value, what memories they hold and how they think. The iconic Chinese TikToks of home gadgets might show that someone values convenience and accommodations for unexpected visits, but scattered jewelry dishes and matching cutlery could indicate that the individual values spontaneity and change in short-term decisions but consistency in long term commitments. 
The space that becomes transformed becomes incredibly unique, like a fingerprint, and essentially, an extension of girls and their handbags or people and their bedside tables. 
Ultimately, there is no lesson to be learned here or any advice to offer. 
Maybe instead, I just want you to reflect on where your fashion journey may take you: Will your next endeavor also be decor? Or will it be art and figurines? Or maybe, it will be leather gloves with fur trim or crystal dice!
Don’t be scared to dive deep into the material reflections of yourself, even if it scares you a little. It’s hard to face ourselves, especially when we are in denial or going through an awkward transition period, but the discomfort and learning of what we like, dislike and value is like pressure and some coal — out will emerge a diamond. 
Besides, a little fright — and new packages — keeps life interesting anyways.

Sultanthegiant, dubbed “Chicago’s Next Rising Star” by NewFire Music, remembers listening to his parents’ music at home from a young age: Bob Marley, Marvin Gaye and Tupac, along with a bunch of gospel and soul. Now, Sultanthegiant performs beyond slam poetry events, open mic nights and appearances in Chicago’s top music publications — his music is now capturing the hearts and minds of fans across Los Angeles with his introspective storytelling. His headlining performances and appearances at KXSC and USC Soundstage continue to shape his professional path. 
Sultanthegiant’s journey begins in a city steeped in eclectic music culture. Like most of Chicago’s music history, a quintessentially rich, distinctive music scene continues to cultivate a strong tradition of popular music and the next generation of up-and-coming artists today. When Sultan Lugboso, a sophomore majoring in music industry, was first starting his career, he recorded his first song in a wooden box. Lacking studio equipment, the Chicago-based musician utilized YouMedia Studio, a public music education program for teens and the same program where Chance the Rapper made his debut. 
“People love to say I don’t have this, I don’t have that…I don’t believe it,” Lugboso said. “I am of the personal belief that you’re never gonna have everything. There’s not gonna be that day where you just like, ‘Damn, I have every resource I need.’ No, even if you have money, you don’t have every resource you need. You’re gonna have money, but you may not have the work ethic.” 
Songwriting has helped Lugboso come to terms with the different shifts occurring in his life, and it first began to take shape from the freedom he felt from expressing himself on stage.
Lugboso’s debut solo song on major streaming services, “Stand Up One Mo’ Time,” documents his story of struggling to move forward in his life and how he feels disconnected and isolated. This title track reflects how Lugboso’s music explores three main themes: honesty, innocence and intimacy. His experiences inform his music, filling it with his unique perspective on the world and on topics that typically aren’t spoken about. His genre-blurring sons stand alone in the current music landscape. His art continues to mark a new chapter in the story of new rising talent.
His style resembles the contemporary style of alternative pop, R&B and neo-soul, evoking memories and releasing repressed emotions. The singer’s smooth eccentric tone matches his poignant lyricism, making his audience feel like he’s your best friend telling you a story of what happened in the last 24 hours over a Facetime call. Lugboso’s vivid and colorful visuals bring you into the world he creates. His music’s jarring honesty will capture your attention instantly and, combined with acoustic-influenced instrumentals, form the perfect R&B track.
Although Lugboso isn’t your average R&B artist, by narrating the development of his identity and by writing intimate stories, his music becomes a universal message where emotional familiarity plays on the listener’s heartstrings. 
The music he creates becomes an escape from situations he can’t control, and serves as a space where he’s an architect for his distinctive art and visuals. His platform is one where anyone can embrace the ongoing narrative in their lives and discover the uniqueness of their identity. The honest nature of his creative work guides other people to become a creative bridge to their world.
Lugboso employs a metaphor of shooting an arrow to elaborate on the determination and consistency he applies to his work.
“If there’s a six feet wall in front of you, and you’re 30 feet behind, and you shoot the arrow, it’s not gonna go over. So what are you trying to do?” Lugboso said. “How about you, 30 feet behind, shoot the arrow just right in front of you? It drops. You pick it up. You do it again, and do it again, until you’re right in front of the wall, then can shoot it over. Easy.”
Sultanthegiant will always keep shooting that arrow forward.
In addition to his music, Lugboso founded Free.99, a creative R&B collective at USC to revitalize an underrepresented genre of music in the L.A. scene. He runs it with his manager and fellow artist Taylor Contarino, a junior majoring in journalism and minoring in music industry. 
“I feel like he’s a really consistent person, which I really appreciate,” Contarino said. “If he says he’s going to do something, he does it.” 
Lilli Rayas, a junior majoring in music industry, works as Lugboso’s publicist. She originally asked him to be part of her public relations project because he is “one of the most dedicated and driven” artists at USC that she knows. 
“From the moment I saw his open mic live performance my sophomore year, I knew he would be an undeniable force in the music industry,” Rayas said. “I think as an artist, he embraces the ongoing narrative in his life, and that gives him the ability to revolutionize his own style.” 
In terms of what’s next for him, Rayas said to expect a new single release and another Free.99 performance by the end of the year.

USC shot 46.15% from the field and doubled their three-point percentage in their second half comeback after falling behind 27-22 in the first half against Vermont. (Eli Masket | Daily Trojan) 
Expletives rained down from the USC coaching staff as the Trojans were held without a field goal for the first four and a half minutes to start the second half in their matchup against University of Vermont. USC was facing a half-time deficit and was flat-out being outplayed by the mid-major Catamounts. But the Trojans turned it around the rest of the second half, improving their shooting percentage by more than 20% to hold on and get their second win of the year, scraping by with a score of 59-57.
USC was led by strong second-half play from fifth-year guard Drew Peterson who scored 15 of his 20 points in the second half. The Trojan’s offense ran through Peterson in the second half, isolating him in the low post against the smaller Vermont defenders. His decision-making was the key to the victory, as he finished with 8 assists and zero turnovers.
“We open the [second] half pretty well, and it’s just something where we need a little bit more toughness and I think we found that in the second half and we have to keep doing it,” Peterson said in an interview with the Daily Trojan. “They got after us in the locker room, especially[Associate Head] Coach [Chris] Capko, and you know sometimes we really need a kick in the ass and that’s awesome because Capko was ready to do it.”
Peterson was no stranger himself to letting a few choice words fly, as he exclaimed ferociously to the crowd after making a clutch turn-around and-one jumper with only 1:57 left to play. This would put the Trojans up five and signify the cherry-on-top to the Trojans’ comeback victory. USC prevented the Catamounts’ first victory against a power-five school in nearly 14 years, as their last win came against Colorado all the way back in 2008.
While it was still a great win and showed that the team had a lot of mental toughness, USC can’t continue to have such lackadaisical starts. The Trojans shot an abysmal 25.9% from the field in the first half and had only 2 field goals in the final 11:40 of the first half. The Trojans also continued to struggle from behind the three-point line making just three of their 16 attempts.
“Even though in our scrimmages we scored 87 and 86 points and looked great and made shots, when the lights turn on it’s a little different,” said Head Coach Andy Enfield after the win. “I think these guys are finding that out. We’re patient with them, very encouraging with them and we hopefully will build on this win and get better.”
The real encouraging sign from USC was their defense. They held a Vermont team who was averaging just over 84 points per game on 45.5% shooting to just 57 points and only 36.8% from the field. The Trojans were able to speed up the Catamounts on offense, not allowing them to get comfortable at any point. USC started marking Vermont from full-court and then switching into a 2-3 zone, pressing them for entire possessions.
Another promising point from the game was the emergence of freshman guard Tre White, who logged a career-high 31 minutes. Although he only scored 4 points, his real impact came on the class. White led the team with 10 total rebounds and showed constant resilience on the defensive end. 
“The little things really got to be our identity, and I just tried to just really just embrace that,” White said. “I know my offense  is going to come. We’ve got scorers all over the court, I know what’s gonna come to me often so I really just try to take pride in the little things, and that’s what’s going to keep us moving forward.”
The Trojans have little time to rest before their next game, where they’ll face off against Mount St. Mary’s University  Friday at 8 p.m. in what will be their fourth home game in a row at  Galen Center.

Sadly, the Major League Baseball season has come to an end. The Houston Astros won their second title (their first without the aid of a trash can). The next generation of stars rose, while others rode off into the sunset. All in all, it was a season for the ages that will surely be missed by myself and like-minded fans. However, a stoppage of play does not bring an end to the excitement for the baseball world. Last year’s free agency period saw the likes of Freddie Freeman, Carlos Correa and Max Scherzer change allegiances, and subsequently turn the league upside down. This offseason might look to top that.
Unquestionably, the largest — both figuratively and literally — free agent this winter is New York Yankees outfielder Aaron Judge. The 6’7 colossus just wrapped up an American League record 62-homer year and the highest single-season fWAR value since Barry Bonds. The MVP will not be announced until Nov. 17, but this one’s pretty much a slam dunk. The Yankees obviously have the money, and Judge has indicated that New York would be the top team on his list. The question between the two sides, however, is the length of his contract. Judge turns 31 in April, and historical trends for players of his height and weight do not support a contract that extends past his mid-thirties. Judge also has his fair share of injury history, which has already caused New York to be especially skittish. If the Yanks are willing to match Judge’s likely $300 million asking price, then I can’t see him not signing. But if not New York, then where?
The San Francisco Giants have made it very clear they will not be “underbid” in their pursuit of Judge. The Giants need to make a sizable move in order to contend with the superstar-laden Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, and the California native may be inclined to an early homecoming if 300-plus million gets tossed his way. They’re not the only ones with deep pockets, however. See, there are two sides to the New York Mets signing Judge, at least in my case. On one hand, as a NL East rival Washington Nationals fan, this would make me very unhappy. But on the other hand, it would bring me complete and utter joy to see the hearts of Yankees fans completely shatter and subsequently descend into despair. Realistically, I don’t see it happening. Despite Mets owner Steve Cohen seemingly happy to spend any amount of money in order to turn his club into a champion, their top target remains re-signing starting pitcher Jacob deGrom. 
Speaking of deGrom, his case is a bit more unique. The two-time Cy Young winner might be the best pitcher on the planet, at least, when completely healthy. The 34-year old has only made 27 starts over the past two seasons, and he likely pitched through injury in half of those. DeGrom may be seeking the highest contract in terms of average annual value in history, potentially toppling last offseason’s $43.3 million per year deal for Scherzer. Unfortunately for the Mets, they paid that deal, too, so deGrom’s asking price might be too much to handle. The Texas Rangers have made it clear that they plan on pursuing deGrom, and their middling pitching staff was often a problem in the heavy-hitting AL West. The Atlanta Braves will also seek deGrom this offseason and could be looking to sign in the two-year, $90 million range. General Manager Alex Anthopoulos is the best in the sport, after all, but I’m still not sure he could pull this off.
Those two are undoubtedly the biggest whales, but there remain plenty of sizable fish in the sea. Shortstop is particularly laden with superstar talent, with the likes of Trea Turner, Xander Bogaerts, Dansby Swanson and Carlos Correa all potentially joining new ball clubs this winter. The NL champion Philadelphia Phillies badly need a shortstop, and it looks like they have their pick of the litter. If I had to pick one, I’d probably lean Bogaerts, as his veteran presence in the clubhouse combined with his much improved glove would be the perfect fit for Philly. 
The Dodgers desperately want Turner back, but there’s a real chance he’ll sign with the cross town Los Angeles Angels instead. With a nucleus of Turner, Mike Trout, Shohei Ohtani and Anthony Rendon, there’s no way they miss the postseason again, right? As for Swanson and Correa, their options are intriguing. The Braves, Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals all remain in contention to sign either one. Decisions, decisions.
Other stars that remain unsigned include starting pitcher Carlos Rodon, center fielder Brandon Nimmo and catcher Willson Contreras. All three provide top-five level impact at their respective positions and would be nice fits among teams looking to seriously contend. Rodon would be a nice fit for the Mets if they lose deGrom, and they might as well scoop up Nimmo if they’re going all in. Catcher is a relatively weak position across the board, so Contreras could really go anywhere (other than Chicago). Houston nearly acquired him prior to the trade deadline, but owner Jim Crane nixed the deal at the last minute. The Astros may scoop up Contreras and make this World Series-winning-deal a yearly thing. Who wouldn’t love to see that?
The offseason is a breath of fresh air for baseball fans. It lets us sit back and take in all we’ve experienced this past season and appreciate what we’ve been given, while free agency primes us for what’s ahead. Despite my own club most likely remaining silent on any major signings, I’m simply excited at the prospect of a new baseball landscape. Hopefully, that’s not just me.

After a brutal loss to UCLA on Friday, USC is looking to win at home this weekend. With tough competition coming to Los Angeles, Calif. from all over the country, the Trojans are ready for one last chance to prove themselves before NCAAs. 
Alongside No. 2 UCLA, top teams from California include No. 1 UC Berkeley and No. 4 Stanford  — all of which hold three out of the four top seeds, according to the Collegiate Water Polo Association poll. In addition to these West Coast powerhouses, USC will host Augustana College, Austin College, Washington and Jefferson College, and Penn State Behrend this weekend. 
The Trojans are 15-6 overall and 1-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Tournament play, and are also currently undefeated at their home pool this season. This weekend is essentially a make-or-break moment for the Trojans, as it is their final contest before a potential NCAA postseason. 
“We feel really confident,” said junior driver Crason Kranz. “We’re actually more excited than we were on Friday to play UCLA again because we have a lot to prove.”
The Bruins’ comeback in the final minute of the fourth quarter last Friday came as a heartbreak to the Trojans, and they are working on cleaning up their defense in practice this week to prepare. 
Redshirt junior driver Chris Agliozzo shared Kranz’ sentiment of positive morale, saying that there are only minor adjustments to be made before facing the competition. 
“We tune up a couple of things, and we’re right there,” Agliozzo said.
Regarding these adjustments, Kranz emphasized the importance of defense during the final moments of the contest — something that has challenged the Trojans multiple times this season. 
“[There are] just some minor adjustments we need to make defensively in the last minute sequence,” Kranz said. 
Last weekend, Kranz executed a steal that led to a key goal, launching USC ahead of the Bruins. So far this season, he has scored 16 goals in total and is going into this weekend hungry for more. 
“It’s a bit of a revenge game for us, especially at home, and we plan on being undefeated at our home pool so we can make NCAAs,” Kranz said. 
USC’s crosstown rival has the Trojans in a three-game shutout and remains ranked one seed higher than USC. For the Trojans, this only gives them more incentive to get the job done this weekend. 
“We had obviously not the result we wanted, but we felt like we gave it a good shot and we’re getting ready for this next weekend,” Agliozzo said. “We feel like we’re in a good spot, things didn’t go our way but we went out there and competed.” 
Agliozzo has a total of 7 goals this season, including a season-high of 3 goals in one game against San Jose State last month. To be able to bring these final moments of season competition home is what it’s all about, according to Agliozzo. 
“It’s awesome to get the chance to play them here at our home pool and in front of a big crowd,” Agliozzo said. “It’s what we all dream about playing here.” 
The Trojans will take on Austin College on Friday at 2:45 p.m., followed by two more days of MPSF Tournament play at Uytengsu Aquatics Center.
